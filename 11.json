They simply took possession of the property when its former possessors were compelled to abandon\u00a0 it by reason of war.\u00a0 They can not be considered as possessors in good faith.\u00a0 (Art. 433, Civil Code.)\u00a0 Not being possessors in good faith,\u00a0 they are not entitled to the structure erected upon land not their own.\u00a0 (Art. 3(12, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>We have said that the last church was constructed upon 1 he site of the former churches.\u00a0 The evidence is in conflict upon this point, but we think it sustains our conclusion.

The only question is whether the appellants were members of the band who committed the offense, and we think the identification of each of the appellants by the witnesses for the prosecution leaves no room for reasonable doubt on that score.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for Simeon de los Santos insists that there is no evidence of record connecting this appellant with the commission of the crime other than his own confession in the court of the justice of the peace, and that this confession was improperly admitted in evidence, it not affirmatively appearing that it was made voluntarily, We think, however, that the testimony of the witnesses Kerr, Hutchings, and Urquico leaves no room for doubt that the confession of this appellant was made voluntarily; and the witness Soto positively identified him as one of the robbers who carried a bolo and threatened to spear the witness with a bamboo when he tried to escape from the scene of the robbery.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for Feliciano Garcia calls attention to the fact that one of his coaccused, Alberto Tolentino, was acquitted by the trial judge although he was identified by the witness Soto as a member of the band which committed the crime, and yet Garcia was convicted upon the testimony of this witness. Counsel argues that since the trial court did not accept Soto's testimony as to Tolentino, it should not have been accepted as to Garcia. It appears, however, that while the witness was clear, positive, and definite in his identification of Garcia, there was some doubt, uncertainty, and hesitation in his identification of Tolentino. Under the circumstances the trial judge properly gave Tolentino the benefit of the doubt which must have been raised in his mind by the hesitation of the witness in identifying this accused, a doubt not so much as to the intention of the witness to tell the truth as of the accuracy of his recollection of Tolentino's face. There was no reason to doubt the identification of Garcia, as to whom the witness was so positive that there could be no mistake unless the witness willfully and maliciously bore false testimony.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for [the defendants] Garcia, Gutierrez, and De los Santos asked for a new trial on the ground that, their counsel in the trial court having been taken ill before the trial, they were not able to secure the presence of their witnesses.\u00a0 The record discloses, however, that, it appearing that the original counsel assigned to defend these accused was sick at the time of the trial, new counsel was assigned for their defense by the court, and it does not appear that any effort was made to secure the presence of witnesses nor was any motion made to the court for a continuance for that purpose.<br\/><br\/>The appellants in a criminal case can not be heard for the first time on appeal to complain that they could not secure the presence of witnesses at the trial, when it does not appear that they made any effort so to do before or during the progress of the trial, or that they sought the aid of the court to compel the attendance of their witnesses, or objected to proceeding without them.<br\/><br\/>The judgment and sentence of the trial court are affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

He, in fact, had at that time on board some carabaos and there was plenty of room to take all that Ullman wished to load; in fact the captain afterwards consented to do so. The refusal aforesaid was not justified and was a violation of the terms of the charter party and was the immediate and proximate cause of\u00a0 the failure to\u00a0 bring the cattle of Pujalte from Phu Yen to Manila.<br\/><br\/>The captain cabled to the charterers on the 22d of November stating that he could not ship\u00a0 the\u00a0 cattle on account of bad weather and asking for instructions as to how long he should remain.\u00a0 The interveners answered that he should wait to load the cattle.\u00a0 On the 24th of November, he again cabled the interveners, stating that he could not wait any longer than the 26th of November; that he had not sufficient water for\u00a0 the\u00a0 cattle\u00a0 then on board, and that Lopez, who was on board as the agent of Lichauco, was getting impatient, and that the weather continued very boisterous.\u00a0 On the 26th of November he made demand on Ullman for 30 tons of fresh water,\u00a0 saying that Ullman would not be permitted to ship his cattle unless he brought with them that amount.\u00a0 Ullman stated that he was unable to do so, and on the 27th of November the captain wrote a letter to Ullman telling him that he saw that it was impossible for him to load the cattle or to bring the water, and that he would leave that afternoon for Manila, which he did.<br\/><br\/>The vessel arrived in Manila on the 3d of December, which was Sunday.\u00a0 The interveners, the charterers, desiring to unload part of the rice at Iloilo,\u00a0 as soon as the boat arrived made a contract by cable with Sander, Wieler &amp; Co., in Honkong, for a voyage to Iloilo, agreeing to\u00a0 pay therefor 800 Hongkong dollars.\u00a0 As soon as the boat arrived the\u00a0 captain applied to the plaintiffs to act as his agents and to attend to\u00a0 the business while here.\u00a0\u00a0 Before that time the plaintiffs had never acted as the agents for this steamer.<br\/><br\/>By the terms of the charter party, the freight for the voyage from Saigon to Manila, which was 9,250 Hongkong dollars, was to be paid on or before the delivery of the cargo and cattle at\u00a0 Manila.\u00a0 The charterers did not desire to make\u00a0 that\u00a0 payment until the balance of the cargo had been unloaded at Iloilo.\u00a0 Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. would not allow the vessel to leave for Iloilo until\u00a0 the freight and all claims for demurrage had been paid or secured.\u00a0 Thereupon the charterers deposited P13,000 with the defendant bank, and it wrote the following letter to Behn, Meyer &amp; Co:<br\/><blockquote><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"MANILA, <i>December 4, 1906.<\/i><br\/><\/div><br\/>\"Messrs.

It was proven that they had made a contract with Pujalte &amp; Co., by the terms of which they had agreed to transport 200 head of cattle from Phu Yen to Manila in this boat and\u00a0 were to receive therefor P12 for each cow and P13 for each carabao.\u00a0 Pujalte &amp; Co. had ready for transportation 202 head of cattle and the testimony was that, although the contract mentioned 200, yet they had a right thereunder to transport 200,\u00a0 or 202, or 204.\u00a0 This freight, amounting to P2,476,\u00a0 the charterers have never received from\u00a0 Pujalte &amp; Co., and of course have no claim against them therefor.\u00a0 Their failure to receive it was directly due to the violation of the terms of the contract by the captain in his refusal to take the cattle on board when they were ready to be shipped, and that violation was the direct and proximate cause\u00a0 of the loss to the charterers of this P2,476.<br\/><br\/>It is suggested in the brief of the appellee that Ullman might have.loaded the cows and left the\u00a0 carabaos there. There is nothing in this suggestion.\u00a0 The testimony shows that Ullman himself intended to come on the <i>Hilary<\/i>, and as he very well said, he was under no obligation to leave a part of his stock there.\u00a0 (Gould <i>vs.<\/i> Grafflin, 62 Fed. Rep., 605.)<br\/><br\/>The interveners claim damages also for the difference between the value of their rice on the day on which it arrived and its value on the day when it would have arrived if the ship had left Phu Yen On the 19th\u00a0 of November.<br\/><br\/>As has been stated, the interveners, on the 24th of November, directed the captain to wait at Phu Yen.\u00a0 For the delay after that time, the ship was not responsible. There is no evidence to show what the price of rice was the day the ship would have arrived if she had sailed on the 24th.\u00a0 The\u00a0 interveners are entitled therefore to recover nothing upon this item of their claim.<br\/><br\/>They claim damages also for losses which Pujalte &amp; Co. and Lichauco suffered by reason of the delay at Phu Yen.\u00a0 These losses consisted of the death of some of the cattle and their depreciation in value at the time they arrived in Manila.<br\/><br\/>The interveners have paid nothing to either Lichauco or Pujalte &amp; Co. on account thereof and neither one of these persons has commenced any action against the interveners for damages.\u00a0 Whether the interveners will ever be compelled to pay anything to them can not now be known.\u00a0 These damages are, in our opinion, too remote to be the subject of an adjudication in this case.\u00a0 Moreover, as to the greater part; of them, namely, the depreciation in the value\u00a0 of the stock, the same can be said as was said in reference to the claim for the loss upon the, rice.\u00a0 The charterers were\u00a0 responsible for the delay from the 24th\u00a0 to the 27th of November, and there is no evidence to fix the value of the stock or\u00a0 what its condition would have been if the ship had\u00a0 sailed from Phu Yen\u00a0 on the 24th.<br\/><br\/>The charter party provided for nine lay days during which the cargo should be taken on board and discharged, and for five days of demurrage at the rate of 250 Hongkong\u00a0 dollars a day.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiffs make a claim for demurrage for six days.<br\/><br\/>We do not think that this claim can\u00a0 be sustained. There is nothing in the case to show how many lay days were consumed in taking on cargo at Saigon and the most that we can assume is that one day was so employed. If the captain had complied with the contract and loaded the cattle at Phu Yen when he should have done so, not more than two days would have been used there.\u00a0 Not more than three days were used in unloading here.\u00a0 The time employed at Iloilo does not appear and in no event could that be considered, for that voyage was the\u00a0 subject of a special contract.\u00a0 So that even if the delay from the 24th of November to the 27th be charged to the charterers, no more than nine days were consumed, which was the time allowed by the charter party.<br\/><br\/>The interveners admitted at\u00a0 the trial that they owed 9,250\u00a0 Hongkong dollars, the freight to Manila, and 800 dollars, the freight to Iloilo, and these are the only amounts which, in our opinion, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover.\u00a0 The evidence indicates that the contract made by the bank was made\u00a0 after the contract with reference to the voyage to Iloilo, and we think from all the evidence in the case that the bank's contract covers the 800 dollars freight to Iloilo.\u00a0 Reduced to Philippine\u00a0 money\u00a0 at the rate found by the court below\u00a0 the\u00a0 freight amounts to P10,753.50.\u00a0 From that amount should be deducted the P2,476 above-mentioned, leaving a balance of P8,277.50 as the amount that the plain tiffs are entitled to recover.<br\/><br\/>Coming to the questions of procedure; the most difficult one is that raised by the first assignment of error, to the effect that the plaintiffs are not the real parties in interest in this case, the claim of the appellants being that the action should have been brought in the name of the owners of the vessel, and that Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. were not the real parties in interest, as that term is used in section 114 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 That section is in part as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.\u00a0 But in the case of an assignment of a right of action, an action by the assignee shall be without prejudice to any set-off or other defense existing at the time of\u00a0 or\u00a0 before notice of the assignment;\u00a0 but this last provision shall not apply to a negotiable promissory note, or a draft or a bill of exchange,\u00a0 transferred in good faith and upon good consideration before maturity. And an executor or administrator\u00a0 or legal\u00a0 representative of a deceased person, or a trustee of an express trust, or a person expressly authorized by law so to do, or a lawfully appointed guardian of a person\u00a0 of unsound\u00a0 mind, or of a minor, may sue or be sued without joining with him\u00a0 the person for whose benefit the action is prosecuted or defended.<br\/><br\/>\"Otherwise than as provided in this section, all persons having an interest in the subject of the\u00a0 action and in obtaining the relief demanded shall be joined as\u00a0 plaintiffs.\"<\/blockquote>The matter is further complicated by the\u00a0 title of\u00a0 the case, which is as follows: \"Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd., in representation of themselves and of the steamer Hilary, and of Messrs. Sander, Wieler &amp; Co., owners of said steamer, plaintiffs,\" and by an allegation in the complaint that the contract made by the defendant bank on the 4th of December was made with the plaintiffs in their capacity as agents of the steamer and of the said owners of the same.<br\/><br\/>If Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. had\u00a0 brought this action\u00a0 upon the charter party itself to recover, the freight therein mentioned, it is very clear that it could not be maintained. They were not parties to that contract and had no interest therein.\u00a0 The action, however, is not brought upon that contract, but is brought upon another contract to which the only parties are the defendant bank and Behn, Meyer &amp; Co.\u00a0 The defendant bank contracted directly with Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. and no mention is made in the contract of the owners of the steamer.<br\/><br\/>After considerable hesitation, we have reached the conclusion that the action can be maintained by Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. in their own names by virtue of\u00a0 article 246 of the Code of Commerce, which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"When the agent transacts business\u00a0 in his own name, it shall not be necessary for him to state who is the principal and\u00a0 he shall be directly liable, as if\u00a0 the\u00a0 business were for his own account, to the persons with whom he transacts the same, said persons not\u00a0 having any right of action against\u00a0 the\u00a0 principal, nor the latter against the former, the liabilities of the principal and of the\u00a0 agent to each other always being reserved.\"<\/blockquote>The evidence shows that Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. were agents of the captain and that the\u00a0 transaction to which their agency relates was a mercantile one.\u00a0 Being such agents, they made\u00a0 a contract in their own names with the defendant bank.\u00a0\u00a0 It appears from the testimony of the manager of the bank that he was not notified and never knew for whom\u00a0 Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. were acting.\u00a0 The document itself shows that he contracted with them in their own names and there is no evidence to show that Behn Meyer &amp; Co. disclosed to\u00a0 the bank the names of the persons for whom they were acting.\u00a0 The manager of the bank never saw the charter party and\u00a0 knew nothing about\u00a0 its contents.\u00a0 The provisions of article 246 of\u00a0 the Code\u00a0 of Commerce are substantive law and are not\u00a0 repealed or modified by section\u00a0 114\u00a0 of the procedural law above referred to. (See Castle Brothers, Wolf &amp; Sons <i>vs.<\/i> Go-Juno,\u00a0 7 Phil. Rep., 144; Pastells <i>vs.<\/i> Hollman, 2 Phil. Rep., 235; Herranz <i>vs.<\/i> Ker, 8,\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 162.)<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs excepted to the order of the court below permitting the charterers to intervene in this proceeding, but they have not appealed from the judgment\u00a0 In any event, it seems very clear that, the action being brought against a surety, the principal debtor would have a right to intervene and join with the defendant in opposing the claim under the provisions of section 121 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 The principal debtor has a direct, legal interest in defeating the claim against his surety. The judgment of the court below is modified, and judgment is ordered in favor\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs\u00a0 and against the defendants for the sum of P8,277.50, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum since the 8th day\u00a0 of December, 1906, and for the costs of the first instance.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in this\u00a0 court.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Celestino Prado defended himself and in turn inflicted several wounds\u00a0 upon\u00a0 Bunsalan.\u00a0 The assaulted man, however,\u00a0 then fled to a distance of over a kilometer, and upon nearing a bamboo field fell face downward.\u00a0 In this position he was afterwards\u00a0 found\u00a0 with several wounds, one in the region of the shoulder\u00a0 blade, to\u00a0 the left; another in the clavicular region; another in the humeral region, higher up; another in the right forearm, and still another upon the\u00a0 wrist.\u00a0 It\u00a0 required forty-five days for the wounded\u00a0 man\u00a0 to recover.\u00a0 The wounds, however, have not resulted in serious injury, incapacity, or deformity, according to his own statement.<br\/><br\/>Bonifacio Bunsalan was also wounded in the right forearm, on the left ear, between the thumb and the forefinger of the left hand, and on the right side of the breast, which wounds also required forty-five days to heal.<br\/><br\/>A complaint having been filed by the provincial fiscal on the 30th of March, 1906, with the Court of First Instance accusing Celestino Prado and Bonifacio Bunsalan of the crime of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">lesiones graves<\/span>, mutually inflicted, the corresponding proceedings were instituted,\u00a0 and the judge, in view of the result thereof, entered judgment on the 10th of\u00a0 July of the same year, sentencing Bonifacio Bunsalan to the penalty of one year and one day of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prision correctional<\/span>, and to\u00a0 pay one-half of the costs;\u00a0 Celestino Prado was acquitted and discharged, and the other half of the costs was declared <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de oficio.<\/span>\u00a0 From this judgment counsel for the accused Bunsalan appealed.<br\/><br\/>The above facts, which are fully proven, constitute the double crime of <i>lesiones graves<\/i>, included in article 416, No. 4, of the Penal Code.\u00a0 Celestino Prado, on leaving the house of Gregorio Sajo on the night of February 1 of said year, was\u00a0 attacked with a bolo by Bonifacio Bunsalan, who was assisted by some of the laborers of the hacienda of\u00a0 the said Sajo, and Prado, in defending himself from the aggression of Bunsalan, wounded the\u00a0 latter with the bolo he carried and which he had just recovered from the side of the staircase where he left it on entering the house; it is an unquestionable fact, not denied\u00a0 by either of them, that they inflicted upon each other the respective wounds.<br\/><br\/>The only question in controversy, and which the court below has already finally decided, was as to which of the two was the aggressor, and who was the one who lawfully defended himself against such aggression.<br\/><br\/>Considering the merits of the case, the charges mutually preferred by the accused, and their respective answers, we can not do otherwise than accept the conclusions of\u00a0 the court below stated\u00a0 in the judgment appealed from, which reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"In considering the proofs appearing in\u00a0 the record,\u00a0 the court is of opinion that the witnesses of Bonifacio Bunsalan did not state the whole truth, because it is evident that the latter were eager to throw all the blame on the other accused, Celestino Prado, as Domingo Bergantin testified that,\u00a0 with\u00a0 the exception of Sajo, himself,\u00a0 and Bonifacio Bunsalan, no other person was present at the commencement of the trouble which is attributed to Celestino Prado, while Basilio Condrado, one of Sajo's laborers, avers that he heard the whole of the conversation between Prado and Sajo at the dining\u00a0 room and saw when the former went downstairs, and when Bonifacio fell to the ground.\u00a0 This shows the absence of veracity in the testimony of the said Bergantin.<br\/><br\/>\"In view of the circumstances under which the crime was committed one is inclined to believe the statement of the accused Prado, to the effect that Sajo's laborers, induced by the latter, were among those who injured him, Bonifacio\u00a0 Bunsalan having\u00a0 inflicted the wounds, as the' latter has\u00a0 confessed, although saying that it was in self-defense.<br\/><br\/>\"From the charges presented against Prado in the court of the justice of the peace, Sajo's intent to injure him is evident, since he was accused of attempted homicide when, as a matter of fact, while Prado conversed with him in the dining room of his house he\u00a0 carried no weapon whatever, and also because of the charge of frustrated homicide filed by Bonifacio\u00a0 Bunsalan against Oelestino Prado, when it was the latter who had received the most wounds.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, by virtue of the evidence, it is the opinion of the court that Bonifacio is liable for the\u00a0 injuries to Celestino Prado, and that in the commission of the crime no circumstance whatever need be considered.<br\/><br\/>\"With regard to Celestina Prado, I am of opinion that, when wounding\u00a0 Bonifacio Bunsalan, he did so\u00a0 in\u00a0 self-defense, inasmuch as, finding himself alone and attacked by Sajo's armed men, he made a lawful defense in order to avoid further injury to himself; therefore, all the requisites of case 4 of article 8 of the Penal Code, constituting exempting circumstances, and not mitigating as\u00a0 alleged by the fiscal, are present.\"<\/blockquote>No legal reason is offered in the case whereby the opinion of the judge, in view of\u00a0 the result thereof, should not be accepted, all the more as he had occasion to hear the statements of the two accused and of the witnesses who testified, and to observe their conduct and manner, together with the conditions and attitude of each witness.<br\/><br\/>The main fact, which has not been impugned, is that Prado, prior to going up to the house of his principal, Gregorio Sajo, in order to remonstrate with the latter for having sold the contends of the fish pond at so low a price {Prado being in charge of the same and having an interest therein), left his bolo near the staircase\u00a0 outside\u00a0 of the house, which shows that\u00a0 Prado, notwithstanding\u00a0 his annoyance, had\u00a0 no intention to cause any bodily harm to Sajo, with whom he was displeased, and he could hardly have had any reason for animosity toward Bunsalan.<br\/><br\/>Undoubtedly\u00a0 Sajo did send for some of\u00a0 his laborers, among whom was Bunsalan, after being reproached by Prado, for the purpose of detaining the latter when leaving his house; this fact confirms the statement by Prado that, when he went out, he was attacked with a bolo by Bonifacio Bunsalan,\u00a0 who\u00a0 acknowledged\u00a0 having been sent for. Prado defended himself against the attack and\u00a0 immediately thereafter fled to the place where he was discovered with several\u00a0 wounds.\u00a0 Such is the story as told by Prado.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, the statement of Bunsalan to the effect that,\u00a0 without any reason whatever, he was attacked by Prado, becomes inexplicable,\u00a0 for there is no reason for such a statement when no quarrel or dispute took place between them, not even a short conversation, before the affray; therefore, we agree with the court below that the\u00a0 aggression came from\u00a0 Bunsalan, who, on the other hand,\u00a0 had not been provoked by Prado, and the latter, in defending himself, made use of rational means to repel the attack of which he was a victim;\u00a0 he should therefore be fully exempted on the ground of self-defense.<br\/><br\/>For\u00a0 the reasons above set forth, and notwithstanding what has\u00a0 been alleged by Bunsalan, the latter should be considered as the only\u00a0 principal in the crime of <i>lesiones graves<\/i> caused to Oelestino Prado, and\u00a0 as such principal he has incurred the penalty fixed by the\u00a0 law, and the same must be imposed on him in the medium\u00a0 degree, since in the commission\u00a0 thereof neither\u00a0 a mitigating nor\u00a0 an aggravating circumstance is present.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from should therefore be affirmed, as to Bonifacio Bunsalan, and he should be further sentenced to suffer the accessory penalties prescribed by article 61 of the Penal Code, and to pay the costs of this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The payment of taxes on property is not alone sufficient evidence of ownership or possession.<br\/><blockquote>\"The payment of taxes on the land by plaintiff, cutting timber thereon,\u00a0 and keeping off trespassers, does not constitute possession, but were merely acts of ownership, tending to show that he claimed to own it.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Pharis <i>vs.<\/i> Jones, 122 Mo., 125.)<\/blockquote>The plaintiff would not lose his property either because he failed to pay his taxes or because the party from whom he bought it continued by mistake to pay them.\u00a0\u00a0 Beyond this, in the present case it is very clear that the entries in the books can have no effect as admissions by him in conflict with his title, inasmuch as they were all made before his purchase; so that the two are not inconsistent.\u00a0 Nor can it be doubted that between that time and the bringing of this action on July 2, 1906, lie was under no obligation whatever to apply for any change in the tax books.<br\/><br\/>On the other point, a contract of sale is good as between the parties to it without registration and is effective as against third persons not holding a registered title, including creditors with attachments and judgments.\u00a0\u00a0 (Fabian <i>vs.<\/i> Smith, Bell &amp; Co., 8 Phil.

This contention of the defendants would be tenable, except for the fact that the said heirs had previously, under the old law,\u00a0 actually divided the said estate.\u00a0 The document of June 7, 1005, was not the only evidence of what had already been done during the lifetime of all the adult heirs of the estate of the said Juan Talon.<br\/><br\/>There was some evidence adduced during the trial of the cause by the plaintiff attempting to show that the defendant Pelagia Magno had instituted an action before a justice of the peace to\u00a0 recover said land.\u00a0 Whether she did or did not does not clearly appear from the record.\u00a0 It does appear from the record, however, that the plaintiff in this cause was not a party in the cause before the justice of the peace and therefore could in no way be affected by such action.<br\/><br\/>From all of the evidence brought to this court, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of said land as against the defendants, and therefore the judgment of the court below is hereby affirmed with costs.\u00a0 So ordered<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

It becomes important to determine exactly what the facts are upon which the second conviction rests.<br\/><br\/>As we understand the case, the defendant was convicted in the first offense for smoking opium in a pipe.\u00a0 He necessarily had in his possession a pipe for that purpose.\u00a0\u00a0 The second complaint is for having in his possession this same pipe, and it is the same possession which he necessarily had when he\u00a0 was smoking the pipe.\u00a0 We do not understand that\u00a0 there was anything to show that he\u00a0 had the pipe in\u00a0 his possession at a different time or that he was the owner of the pipe.\u00a0 The possession with which he is charged in the second complaint is the same possession which he necessarily had in committing the offense described in the first complaint.\u00a0 That this is the true condition of the case, we think\u00a0 appears from all the\u00a0 proceedings therein.\u00a0 For example,\u00a0 the court in its decision\u00a0 said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The question presented by this record is, whether the defendant, having been convicted of the offense of smoking opium, can be again tried upon a complaint charging him with the possession of the identical apparatus or utensils used by him to commit the other offense?\"<\/blockquote>The Attorney-General says in his brief:<br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 defendant admitted\u00a0 all the\u00a0 facts stated in the complaint, and the fiscal admitted also that the pipe and lamp\u00a0 were the same which the defendant had used and which were presented as proof in the\u00a0 other case.\"<\/blockquote>The appellant in his brief says:<br\/><blockquote>\"At midnight of the 19th of February, 1908, the municipal treasurer of Palo, Province\u00a0 of Leyte, P. I., entered the dwelling house of the accused and caught him smoking opium in an apparatus used for this purpose.\u00a0 The accused was arrested at once and the apparatus together with a small quantity of opium was confiscated.\u00a0 Two informations were\u00a0 filed\u00a0 against him, one for violating section 4 of Act No. 1761, which prohibits and punishes the smoking of opium, and the other for having in his possession the apparatus or paraphernalia used for smoking opium, penalized by section 7\u00a0 of said Act.<br\/><br\/>\"It being certain that the possession which the defendant had of the pipe and which is the basis of the claim that he violated\u00a0 section\u00a0 7 of the\u00a0 law,\u00a0 was the\u00a0 same possession which\u00a0 he necessarily had\u00a0 of the pipe when lie was convicted\u00a0 of a\u00a0 violation\u00a0 of\u00a0 section 4, we agree with the\u00a0 attorney for\u00a0 the appellant that the second judgment can not be sustained.\u00a0 He says:<br\/><br\/>\"The Existence of the one crime (the possession) is necessary for the existence of the other, inasmuch as in order to smoke opium it is essential first to possess some quantity of the\u00a0 drug and the apparatus used therefor. As\u00a0 the defendant was already convicted and sentenced for smoking opium, and the judgment executed, it is improper to prosecute him again for having in his possession the apparatus for smoking opium, because such possession was necessarily involved in\u00a0 the first, of which it is the foundation, and was therefore included in the first conviction.\"<\/blockquote>In the case <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">In re<\/span> Nielsen (131 U.\u00a0 S., 176, 188) the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It seems to us very clear that where, as in this case, a person has been tried and convicted for a crime which has various incidents included in it, he can not be\u00a0 a second time tried for one of those incidents without being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.\" <\/blockquote>In the case of People <i>vs.<\/i> Cox (107 Mich., 435, 438) the court said :<br\/><blockquote>\"The lesser offense is necessarily included in the greater, and 'as the Government can not begin with the highest, and then go down step by step; bringing the man into jeopardy for every dereliction included therein, neither can it begin with the lowest and ascend to the highest with precisely the same result.'\"<\/blockquote>In the case of The People <i>vs.<\/i> Defoor (100 Cal., 150, 154) it appeared that the complaining witness, Jones, was seated in Raggio's store, the defendant came in and after addressing some\u00a0 abusive language\u00a0 to\u00a0 Jones, struck him upon the head with a whisky glass; that Jones got up, whereupon the two men seized each other, and in the struggle\u00a0 that followed fell upon the floor, each striking the other as opportunity offered; that during the struggle, Jones was bitten upon the thumb by the defendant, and that the thumb was later amputated,\u00a0 Afterwards, two informations were filed against the defendant, the first charging him with an assault upon Jones with a glass tumbler with intent to kill and murder Jones, and the second for mayhem.\u00a0 He was tried upon the first complaint\u00a0 and convicted of an assault.\u00a0 He was afterwards brought to trial upon the second complaint, for mayhem, and he pleaded a former conviction, which plea the court sustained, saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"Nor does it make any\u00a0 difference that\u00a0 the conviction was for the higher offense of mayhem, since that offense could not be proved without proving the assault for which he had already been convicted.\u00a0 The doctrine of merger, to which great importance is given in many of the cases, can not aid the respondent.\u00a0 If the information for mayhem had been the only one filed, the\u00a0 conviction would have merged the lower included offense of an assault, but the\u00a0 conviction of mayhem could not merge a prior conviction and judgment for the same assault.\"<\/blockquote>(See also, Grafton <i>vs.<\/i> The United States, 206 U. S., 333.)<br\/><br\/>Whether, if the defendant had been acquitted of the first charge, he could have been tried upon the second complaint, is a question which we do not decide.<br\/><br\/>In the case of The United States <i>vs.<\/i> Capurro (7 Phil. Rep., 24) it was held that an acquittal of the crime of robbery would not prevent a prosecution for assaulting a public official, the same transaction being\u00a0 involved in both cases.\u00a0 An examination of the record in that case, and particularly of the decision of the court upon the first trial for robbery, will show that there is no inconsistency between that decision and the present one.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the defendant acquitted of the complaint, with the costs of both instances <i>de oficio.<\/i><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

It appears that the defendant purchased\u00a0 hemp in and about the pueblo of Daet in the Province of Ambos Camarines and shipped the same to the plaintiff in Manila to be sold.\u00a0 The record discloses that the plaintiff sold to the defendant various classes of goods, wares, and merchandise and also\u00a0 sent to the defendant from time to time checks or bills of exchange as part payment for the hemp and coprax.\u00a0 These transactions\u00a0 continued over several years and up to the time when the plaintiff went into liquidation.\u00a0 No question is raised by the defendant as to the disposition made by the plaintiff of the coprax so remitted by him to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The defendant\u00a0 alleges that he was damaged because certain\u00a0 portions of the hemp had been pledged by the plaintiff to secure money and for that reason did not sell the hemp o\u00a0 the best advantage.\u00a0 The defendant also claims that the plaintiff made unauthorized charges against him\u00a0 for storage, insurance, and interest, and for the repacking and shrinkage of said hemp.<br\/><br\/>During the trial of the cause the defendant attempted to prove that the plaintiff did at various times, in order to secure money for itself, pledge certain portions of the hemp.\u00a0 No evidence was shown, however, as to how much of said hemp was pledged, neither was there any direct or specific evidence showing just how the defendant was injured, if at all, by this pledge.\u00a0 The defendant\u00a0 admitted during the trial that all of the hemp which he\u00a0 had sent to the plaintiff had been sold.<br\/><br\/>The exact terms of the contract between the plaintiff and defendant do not appear of record, neither does the record disclose the exact nature of the control of the hemp in question which the plaintiff could exercise over the same, but granting that the plaintiff had no authority to pledge the hemp, yet the evidence does not disclose any fact or facts which would justify the conclusion that the defendant was in any way injured by such pledge.\u00a0 The defendant, makes the allegation that by reason of said pledge the hemp was not sold to the best advantage; no proof, however, is introduced to support this charge. There was some proof to show that the price of hemp varied and that at some times it was higher than at others, but there was no proof introduced to show that the plaintiff had any hemp on hand belonging to the defendant which might have been sold at the time of the prevailing higher prices.\u00a0 Then was no evidence presented during the trial which tended in any way to show that the plaintiff was not given\u00a0 full discretion as to the time for selling the hemp. The defendant introduced a letter during the trial of the cause, written by him and directed to the plaintiff, relating to the time of selling some of the hemp, but there is nothing to show that the plaintiff did not sell Hint particular hemp in accordance with the instructions contained in said letter.<br\/><br\/>The defendant also claims that he was damaged by reason of the fact that the weight of the hemp in Manila did not correspond with the weight at the time of shipment of the same from the pueblo of\u00a0 Daet,\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff refuted this evidence by showing that the weight of the hemp, even after it was baled, varied, and that especially the hemp from Daet varied more than the hemp from some of the other provinces, for the reason that the Daet hemp was not well cleaned, and that the\u00a0 weight, of the hemp also varied from time to time, depending upon the way\u00a0 it was cleaned, when it was packed, and the time elapsing after it was cleaned and the time of packing.\u00a0 The defendant introduced no evidence to show that\u00a0 he was\u00a0 not credited in full for the full weight of all the hemp received.<br\/><br\/>The defendant also alleged that the charges of insurance made by the plaintiff were excessive.\u00a0 He introduced no proof, however, to sustain this allegation.<br\/><br\/>The defendant set up a counterclaim or set-off in his petition.\u00a0 This he evidently abandoned, for the reason that he presented no proof to sustain the same.<br\/><br\/>The defendant further alleges that the plaintiff had no legal right to charge interest upon the balances due from time to time and relies upon articles 312 and 313 of the Code of Commerce, and article 1109 of the Civil Code, to support this contention.<br\/><br\/>It is admitted that the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant was a verbal one.\u00a0 Under the above-cited provisions of the code and under the form of contract here sued upon, the plaintiff was not entitled to interest upon the balances due from time to time, until after there had been a judicial demand made for the payment of said balances.<br\/><br\/>The evidence shows that the defendant had been furnished from time to time with a report of the receipt, sale, and expenses connected with the sale of said hemp. The record does not disclose that the defendant made any objection to any of these items.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, at the time of the commencement of the action, made as a part of the complaint a copy of the accounts existing between it and the defendant ; the defendant, therefore, at the time of the commencement of the action had a full and complete statement of all of the items and charges made against\u00a0 him by the plaintiff. These items show that the plaintiff at various times charged the defendant with interest in the sum of P10,665.29.\u00a0 This amount should be deducted from the amount claimed by the plaintiff.\u00a0 Deducting this\u00a0 amount (P10,665.29) from the amount claimed by the plaintiff (P28,819.53)\u00a0 leaves a balance of P18,154.24,\u00a0 the a mount which the defendant owes the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>It is the judgment of this court, after considering all the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, that the decision of the lower court be affirmed, and that a judgment be rendered for the\u00a0 sum of P18,154.-4 in\u00a0 favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, with interest\u00a0 at the rate of 6 per cent from the 11th day of February, 1905, and costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.J.,\u00a0 Torres,\u00a0 Mapa, Willard, <\/i>and <i>Tracey, JJ., <\/i>concur.<br\/><i>Carson,J.,<\/i> did not sit in this case.<\/div>",

JULIO HERRERA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRACEY, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Tayabas, awarding to the plaintiff certain hemp lands.<br\/><br\/>Among the errors assigned was the refusal of the judge to adjourn the trial in compliance with a stipulation in writing and absolute in terms, signed by both parties, providing for such an adjournment. \"The judge in denying the motion assigned as a reason that the defendant had not cited his witnesses, whereas those of the plaintiff were present in court. In the absence of a better reason than this for the release of either party from his written agreement, it was the duty of the judge to give effect to it and to adjourn the case. His refusal to do so, however, was not excepted to and for this reason can not serve as ground for reversal.<br\/><br\/>After the denial of this motion the trial proceeded and although the defendant had no witnesses he put in documentary proof as to his title. This, however, by itself is by no means convincing, but oil the contrary we are satisfied that the judge has correctly weighed the evidence before him, which he has recited in his decision, and on the strength of his recital we affirm the judgment.<br\/><br\/>In citing the evidence before us we refer to the documents only, inasmuch as no other evidence has been properly transmitted to this court. What appear to be intended as the notes of the oral testimony are in English, in pencil handwriting, presumably that of the judge who tried the case. No satisfactory reason is given for not transmitting the notes in typewriting nor is the absence of a stenographer shown, thus dispensing with the customary form of taking and perpetuating testimony. The case is somewhat similar to that of Remo <i>vs.<\/i> Espinosa<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>\u00a0 (6 Off. Gaz., 444), the chief distinction being that in the other case, unlike the present, the evidence could not be reviewed for the lack of a sufficient motion for a new trial. Although Act No. 1123 of the Philippine Commission had dispensed with the printing of testimony on appeal, it has not authorized either the omission thereof from the bill or its inclusion in illegible or inconvenient form; consequently the record before us is defective.<br\/><br\/>This court has frequently decided that upon the appellant rests the burden of preparing the bill of exceptions in order to bring his appeal properly before us. (Garcia <i>vs.<\/i> Hipolito, 2 Phil. Rep., 732; Gaspar <i>vs.<\/i> Molina, 5 Phil. Rep., 197; Bustamante <i>vs.<\/i> Bustamante, 7 Phil. Rep., 125; Code of Civil Procedure, sec. 501.)<br\/><br\/>Upon him, therefore, rather than upon the respondent, falls the consequence of the failure of the record. We do not think, however, that the parties litigant in a trial court are left entirely at the mercy of the presiding judge as to the testimony available on appeal. Either party may at the outset request that the evidence be taken in full, and may meet a refusal to comply with this request either by testimony taken at his own instance, which must be made a part of the record, or may move that the notes be taken by a stenographer, if one is present, or otherwise, by the clerk or other person designated by the judge, and a denial of this motion will be subject to exception.<br\/><br\/>Although there is no express provision of our statutes requiring stenographers to taken notes in civil cases, it is not to be presumed that their appointment and service in the courts is one of caprice. When furnished by the Government to the court, they must be used for the perpetuation of testimony in proper form. In any case, whether stenographic or longhand, notes of testimony should be produced for the use of this court in typewriting, when not printed. In order to settle some of the existing doubts as to the proper practice in this respect, this court has, under the power conferred upon it by section 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure, adopted the following rule, which for the convenience of judges and lawyers is here reproduced :<br\/><blockquote> \"RULE 17. In the Courts of First Instance and the Court of Land Registration it shall be the duty of the trial judge, upon motion of any party of record, to cause to be taken all of the testimony received and all the proceedings in any civil cause, action, or proceeding by the official stenographer if his services are available; and in his absence the judge shall cause such evidence and proceedings to be reduced to writing by the clerk or by some other competent person. When testimony taken in a trial court forms a part of any record sent to the Supreme Court, such testimony must be extended in typewriting and duly certified as correct.\"<\/blockquote>Therefore the judgment of the court below is hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

El terreno que se describe esta con una superficie de 1, 444.35 metros cuadradoss conforme se detalla en la plano adjunto.\"<br\/><br\/>Toda la cuestion suscitada a qui por la oposicion versa sobre la verdadera situacion de la linea divisoria entre la propiedad del solicitante y la de los opositores.<br\/><br\/>El terreno del solicitante en la parte que linda con la calle Aguinaldo tine de extension veintiseis metros setenta y dos centimetros segun el plano que se ha acompanadora la solicitud de inscripcion, comprendida dicha extension entre los puntos marcades con las letras D. y E. en el plano. Por este ultimo punto es por donde linda con la propiedad de los opositores. Alegan estos en su escrito de oposicion que el solicitante ha incluido en su plano una faja de terrano de 1.72 metros de frente por 45.36 metros de fondo sita en la parte S.O. de terreno decrito en la solicitud, sobre le cual tienen construida parte de una casa de su propiedad. el solicituante ha tratado de probar por el contrario que los opositores han usurpado mas dos varas de su terreno y que parte de la casa de los mismos esta edificada sobre una porcion de esas dos varas por ellos usurpadas.<br\/><br\/>En vista de las pruebas el Juez a quo declaro lo siguiente:<br\/><br\/>\"Antiguamente habia un cerco en dicha linea divisoira, pero las declraciones de los testigos de ambas partes son tan contrarias como las pretensiones de las partes mismas, y el Tribunal no esta cnvencido que la faja en cuestion estaba incluida en los terrenos de los causantes del solicitante. El testigo Rocamora ha declarado que la distancia desde el punto D. en el plano a lo largo de la calle Aguinaldo hasta la caida de la casa de los opositores es 25 metros 60 centimetros, y los opositores han manifestado en Tribunal abierto su disposicion a admitir que la verdadera linea divisoria esta inmediatamente despues de dicha caida. El Tribunal adoptara esta solucion y la decripcion del terreno del solicitante debe ser cambiada cortando la linea \"D E\" hasta 25.60 metros y cambiando las otras lineas para excluir de la parte S.O. de dicho terreno una faja de un metro 12 centimeros de anchura, extnediendo desde la calle Aguinaldo hasta el terreno marcado en el plano como terreno de Antonia Trinidad. Justificado por los documentos y las declaraciones de los testigos presentados que el solictante ha adquirido legalmente el dominio de la finca descrita en el expediente, con la enmienda en su descripcion arriba ordenada, se decreta la adjudicacion y registro de la misma a favor del solicitante.\"<br\/><br\/>En la pagina 38 del expediente se lee esto: \"El Abogado del opositor manifiesta que la faja de terreno en cuestion es mas de dos varas de ancho y que la caida de la casa del opositor llega hasta casi la mitad de esta anchura. El opositor manifiesta que puede convenir por si el solicitante esta conforme, que el verdadero limite de su terreno y el del solictnte es una liea que pase inmediatamente a dicha caida; sindo asi que casi todo el terreno en cuestion pertenece al solicitante y casi la mitad al opositor.\"<br\/><br\/>Esta proposicion de convenio no ha sido aceptada por el solicitante, y sin embargo como dice expresamente el Juez en la sentencia, es la que se ha adoptodo como base para la resolucion del asunto, dando por supuesto que la linea divisoria de las dos fincas se halla inmediatamente despues de la caida de la casa de los opositores.<br\/><br\/>No vemos como puede darse por supuesto este hecho. En realidad ninguna de las partes lo ha admitido, ni lo ha alegado ni tratado de probarlo en el juicio. Los opositores lo propusieron tan solo como medio para llegara un convenio, y el solicitante lo nego rotundamente al rechazar el convenio propuesto. Por consiguiente la declaracion de Rocamora citada en la decision carece de importancia, puesto que no se trata aqui de determinar la extension del terreno del solicitante medido hasta la casa de los opoistores, sino el hacho de si esta casa ocupa o no parte de dicho terreno.<br\/><br\/>El solicitante declaro que antiguamente habia un cerco que separaba su propiedad de la del opositor; pero que al edificar este su casa en 1901 quito dicho cerco poniendo otro que hizo avanzar unas do varas dentro de su terreno, construyendo parte de la casa sobre un aporcion del terreno asi usurpado por el opositor; que entonces le envio este recado para que dejara libre su terreno, pero le contesto diciendo vamos al pleito; y que su terreno media treinta y dos varas de frente antes de cambiares por el opositor el carco. El testigo Agripino Orcullo declaro tambien que la media agua de la casa del opositor ya paso del terreno de Eugenio (hoy de los opositores) al terreno que hoy es del solicitante. Estas declaraciones han sido corroboradas por Hilarion Alquisola, unico testigo de los opoistores que ha declarado sobre el lindero de las dos propiedades, el cual dice que el antiguo cerco ha sido cambiado por otro nuevo y que este no esta puesto ya en el mismo sitio que aquel ocupaba sino que esta un poco mas retirado hacia el Norte. Y el solar del solicitante se halla mas hacia el Norte con relacion al de los opositores.<br\/><br\/>Consultada la prueba documental, consistente en escrituras publicas insritas en el Registro de la propiedad, presentada por el solicitante sin objecion alguna de los opositores, resulta que aquel compro en 22 de Octubre de 1890 a Ramon y Martina Carrion un solar que media diez y seis varas de frente; y en 24 del mismo mes y ano compro a Aniceto Orcullo otro solar contiguo a aquel que tenia asimismo diez y seis varas de ancho. Esta admitido que estos dos solares forman con otro situado al Este de los mismos, adquirido posteriormente por el mismo solicitante, el terreno descrito en el plano adjunto a la solicitud de inscripcion. Segun dichas escrituras el terreno del solicitante debe tener en su totalidad treinta y dos varas de frente, las que reducidas a metros dan justamente, con diferencia de dos centimentros mad o menos en perjuicio de dicho solicitante, los veintiseis metors setenta y dos centimetros que figurna en el plano.<br\/><br\/>En cambio los opositores no han presentado mas pruebas que un documento que no fue admitido por el Tribunal, y la declaracion de Clodoaldo rocamora que segun ya se ha dicho, carece de importancia en el juicio, y la ya mencionada de Hilarion Alquisola que mas bien perjudica que favorece a los opositores. Es en nuestro concepto manifiesta la preponderancia de las pruebas en favor del solicitante.<br\/><br\/>Por tanto y con revocacion de la sentencia apelada en cuanto ordena la eliminacion de una faja del metro 12 centimetros del terreno objeto del litigio, se declara de la propiedad del solicitante dicho terreno en su totalidad y que es procedente la adjudicacion y registro del mismo a su favor tal cual aparece descrito en el plano que se acompana a la solicitud de inscripcion, sin especial pronunciamiento de costas. Trascurridos veinte dias desde la notificacion de esta decision, dictese sentencia a tenor de lo resuelto y diez dias despues, devuelvanse los autos al Juzgado de su procedencia para los efectos a que en derecho hubiere lugar.<br\/><br\/>Asi se ordena.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Willard<\/i> and <i>Tracey, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<\/div><\/div>",

HORD, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE. <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>WILLARD, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The defendant demurred to the complaint in this action, the demurrer was sustained, the plaintiff declined\u00a0 to amend, final judgment was entered against the defendant, and he has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The only question is whether the complaint states\u00a0 a cause of action or not It alleges in substance that the plaintiff, a mercantile partnership, paid internal-revenue taxes between the 13th of April, 1905, and the 2d of January, 1906, amounting to P2,175.52, and that those taxes were\u00a0 paid into the\u00a0 municipal treasury of Virac and amounted to one-third of 1 per cent of the value of certain hemp sold by the\u00a0 plaintiff.\u00a0 The hemp was sent by the plaintiff to Aldecoa &amp; Co., in\u00a0 Manila, who afterwards sold it as commission merchants on behalf of the company; and upon making such sale they also paid one-third of 1 per cent upon its value.\u00a0 The plaintiff alleges that the payment it made was\u00a0 made under protest and it seeks to recover the sum of P2,175.52 from the defendant, who is the Collector of Internal Revenue.<br\/><br\/>Sections 139 and 140 of the Internal Revenue\u00a0 Law (Act No. 1189) are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 139.\u00a0 Except as hereinafter\u00a0 specifically\u00a0 exempted, there shall be paid by each\u00a0 merchant and manufacturer a tax at the\u00a0 rate of one-third of one per\u00a0 centum\u00a0 on the gross value in money of all goods, wares,\u00a0 and merchandise sold, bartered, or exchanged for domestic consumption in the Philippine Islands, and this tax shall be paid whether such commodities consist of raw materials or manufactured or partially manufactured products, and whether of domestic production or imported.\u00a0 This tax shall be assessed on the\u00a0 actual selling price at which every\u00a0 such merchant or manufacturer disposes of his commodities and shall\u00a0 be paid at the end of each quarter in the sum lawfully due on the gross amount in money of the sales made by every such merchant or manufacturer during each such quarter.\u00a0 And each such merchant or manufacturer shall, on the first day of January, nineteen hundred and five, or on the date thereafter on which any such merchant or manufacturer engages in any such mercantile or manufacturing pursuit, pay a tax of two pesos.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 140. Every person who on his own account, or on commission for another, is engaged in the sale,\u00a0 barter, or exchange of foreign or domestic goods, wares, or merchandise of any and all kinds for domestic consumption, and whether\u00a0 such goods, wares, or merchandise consist of raw materials or of\u00a0 manufactured\u00a0 or partially manufactured products, shall be\u00a0 considered as a\u00a0 merchant within the meaning of this article.\"<\/blockquote>The claim of the plaintiff is that the hemp was not sold by it to Aldecoa &amp; Co., and that the only sale that it made was the sale which Aldecoa &amp; Co..\u00a0 as its agents, made in its behalf in Manila, and that when the defendant compelled the\u00a0 plaintiff to pay one-third of 1 per\u00a0 cent\u00a0 of the value of the hemp\u00a0 and also compelled Aldecoa &amp; Co. to pay again one-third of 1 per cent upon such value he recovered the same tax twice.<br\/><br\/>We entirely agree with the plaintiff, that there was\u00a0 only one sale of the hemp.\u00a0 The sending of the hemp from Virac to Manila to the agents of the plaintiff did not constitute a sale thereof.\u00a0 Such sale was only effected when the agents afterwards disposed of the hemp in Manila, but this does not resolve the\u00a0 question\u00a0 presented. It\u00a0 is very apparent that the tax under discussion is\u00a0 not a\u00a0 tax upon property.\u00a0 It is rather a tax upon the occupation or industry in which\u00a0 a person is engaged.\u00a0\u00a0 These sections, 139 and 140, are found in Chapter XVI of the Internal Revenue Law which relates to \"Tax on business, manufacture, and occupation.\"\u00a0 Section 144 of that chapter provides\u00a0 that stockbrokers shall pay an annual tax of P80; real-estate brokers, P80; custom-house brokers, P80;\u00a0 pawnbrokers, P200; lawyers and doctors,\u00a0 P50, and other occupations are mentioned therein, the tax on which is a gross\u00a0 sum per annum, or a sum to be determined with reference to the number of days in which the occupation is carried on, or, in the case of billiard rooms, the number of tables used. Nowhere in this section 144 is found any provision for a tax upon commission merchants.\u00a0 The law having provided for a tax on other agents, such as stockbrokers, reale state brokers, and custom-house-brokers, it\u00a0 can\u00a0 not be presumed that it was the intention of the legislator to relieve commission merchants from the necessity of paying any taxes for the business which\u00a0 they carry on.\u00a0\u00a0 The difference between the tax upon a stockbroker, for example, and the tax\u00a0 upon a commission merchant, rests only in the manner of determining how much tax shall be paid. It was the clear intention of the law to tax both.\u00a0 The stockbroker pays a definite sum per annum, but for reasons which must have appeared sufficient to the legislator, it was decided to adopt some other measure for determining how much commission merchants should pay, and\u00a0 the method adopted was to require them\u00a0 to pay one-third of 1 per cent upon the value of all the sales made by them.<br\/><br\/>As has been said above, this is in no sense a tax upon the property sold; it is merely a method of deciding how much the\u00a0 person who makes the\u00a0 sale shall pay as a\u00a0 tax upon the business in which he is engaged.\u00a0 The money in this case paid by Aldecoa &amp; Co. was paid as a tax upon their business and not as a tax upon the business of the plaintiff.\u00a0 There is no allegation in the complaint that the money paid by\u00a0 Aldecoa &amp; Co. was the money of the plaintiff, and under the terms of the law it must have been the money of Aldecoa &amp; Co.\u00a0 It is true that the tax to be paid by commission merchants for carrying on their business and the tax to be paid by merchants for carrying on their business is determined in the same way, but that does\u00a0 not constitute in\u00a0 any sense double taxation.<br\/><br\/>Why the plaintiff paid this tax in Virac in the Province of Albay and not in Manila, where it actually made\u00a0 the sale, does not appear, but no point is made with reference to this matter in the brief and we do not see how the place of payment could in any way affect the plaintiff, as the amount due to be paid was the same whether paid in Albay or in Manila.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with\u00a0 the costs of this instance against the\u00a0 appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

It is unnecessary, therefore, to consider the constitutional, questions discussed in the briefs, based on the omissions from the imperfect record.<br\/><br\/>It is contended that the malversation in this\u00a0 case\u00a0 is qualified by the fact that the\u00a0 moneys taken were recovered by the Government.\u00a0 This incident is of no practical importance for two reasons, first, the\u00a0 money was not returned or made good by the accused, so as\u00a0 to entitle them to the benefits of the provisions of article 392 of the Penal Code, had that article been properly applicable, but was, on the contrary, recovered by the Government through its own efforts and in spite of their endeavor to the contrary, and, second, because their offense does not fall under the said article 392, as appropriation to their own use of public moneys which they were\u00a0 able\u00a0 to\u00a0 make good, but rather under article 390 of the Penal Code, as appropriation\u00a0 of public moneys to their own use with the intent of keeping it.\u00a0 The distinction between these two offenses, resting\u00a0 in the intention of the official to restore or not to restore the money, is clearly pointed out in the case of The United States <i>vs.<\/i> Coates (4 Phil. Rep., 581).\u00a0 Every fact in the present case points to the deliberate and permanent misappropriation of the fund.<br\/><br\/>In sentencing the two principal offenders, the trial judge took their drunkenness into\u00a0 consideration as an extenuating\u00a0 circumstance.\u00a0\u00a0 The facts above recited,\u00a0 as\u00a0 we\u00a0 read them in the record, did not justify him in doing so.\u00a0 There was no such drunkenness as decreases their responsibility for their\u00a0 acts.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, the Attorney-General asks for an increase of the penalty on the ground that the offense was committed by night.\u00a0 It is impossible\u00a0 to accede to this request, as, although the safe was disposed of after nightfall, the moneys, the taking\u00a0 of which constitutes the\u00a0 statutory offense,\u00a0 were withdrawn from the treasury during daylight.<br\/><br\/>Our conclusion\u00a0 is\u00a0 that the\u00a0 defendants, Dowdell\u00a0 and Ham, who alone have appealed, are guilty\u00a0 of malversation of public funds under article 390 of the Penal Code, without\u00a0 any extenuating or\u00a0 aggravating circumstance. The penalty imposed is\u00a0 that of <i>presidio mayor<\/i>,in its medium degree,\u00a0 with imprisonment for eight years and one day, one-half of the costs in this instance to be paid by each of the appellants, the judgment of the court below in other respects being affirmed.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

It was in the time of Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara, governor and captain-general. Having refused to submit to the Chinese demand, the captaingeneral, in preparation for the threatened invasion, ordered the abandonment, not only of the posts held by the Spaniards at Zamboanga and other parts of Mindanao, but also of that of Ternate in the Moluccas, which had been taken by them in 1606 and held since that time. The garrison of Ternate, thus evacuated, came to Manila in 1663.<br\/><blockquote>\"The <i>Mardicas<\/i> (men of the sea), a race very friendly to the Spaniards, accompanied the latter to Manila, taking with them to their new country the Holy Child of Ternate, patron of their town, whose image they held in great veneration. Land was assigned to them in Maragondon, Province of Cavite, where they established the town of Ternate, the present inhabitants of which are the descendants of those loyal islanders.\" (Historia de Filipinas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Montero, Tomo I, p. 327).<\/blockquote>In the <i>Revista de Filipinas <\/i>for the years 1875 and 1876 there appeared an article written on May 4, 1863, by one who then visited Ternate to inquire concerning the tradition there current relating to the image. One of the oldest inhabitants of the place, speaking to the author of the article, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is true, sir, that we originally came from a far distant country.\u00a0 When Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara was governor of these Islands, about the year 1654, he learned that there was being prepared a great expedition in China, consisting of many ships and thousands of men for the conquest of the Philippines. He thereupon endeavored to gather together in Manila as many fighting men as possible to resist this powerful enemy and wrote to Ternate, in the Moluccas, from whence came our forefathers, that the few Spanish soldiers that were there should come to reenforce the troops in Manila. As soon as the plight of Manila was known, vessels were prepared, and the head of the expedition asked what<i> Mardicas <\/i>wished to go to the war. Our ancestors volunteered to the number of two hundred, and came with their Spanish missionary, a Franciscan, bringing the venerated image of the Holy Child that is the patron of our church. After their arrival there was no war, but many of our ancestors served on his majesty's ships; afterwards they were assigned land to live upon, which is now known as Bagumbayan. In the middle of the last century the government had the <i>Mardicas<\/i> come here in order to protect Maragondon from the continual attacks of the Moros, and since that time our forefathers and we have been established here. That is all I know of our predecessors.\"<\/blockquote>Though this article lacks something of the seriousness of history, it agrees in the main with what appears from other sources, but, as will be seen hereafter, the <i>Mardicas<\/i>were established in Maragondon much earlier than the middle of the eighteenth century. Ternate was at that time a hamlet (<i>barrio<\/i>) of the town (<i>pueblo<\/i>) of Maragondon and is situated on the coast of the Province of Cavite, opposite the Island of Corregidor. It was later made a separate town.<br\/><br\/>Established there probably not later than 1700, nothing appears as to the Mardicas until 1740, when\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"His reverence, the provincial father, Fulcheiro de Spilimbergo, of this town and church of Maragondon, saw the book of elections of the prefect and other officials of this holy congregation or brotherhood of the holy name of Jesus of Ternate, and it appeared to him that not only should it be preserved and cherished with all care is one of the most tender and glorious memories of these Islands, glorious for its antiquity, since it dates its commencement from the founding of Christianity in this province by the preaching of the apostle San Francisco Xavier *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * most tender and devout; since in memory of those fervent <i>Mardicas <\/i>who, seeing themselves abandoned by the Spaniards in order to maintain their Christianity, with pious generosity abandoned their country, homes, and privileges, and came to these Islands in order to live in security in our holy Catholic faith, bringing with them their cherished image of the Holy Child Jesus as in triumph of their fidelity.\"<\/blockquote>In the same year the Archbishop of Manila \"conceded forty days' indulgence to those who should devotedly recite a <i>Pater Noster, Ave Maria, <\/i>before the holy image of the Most Holy Child Jesus of Ternate which is venerated in the parochial church of Maragondon.\"<br\/><br\/>In 1769 the Archbishop of Manila \"concedes eighty days' indulgence to those who should devotedly recite a <i>Pater Noster, Ave Maria,<\/i> before the holy image of the Most Holy Child Jesus of Ternate, which is venerated in the parochial church of Maragondon.\"<br\/><br\/>It appears clearly from these documents that the image was in those days in the parish church of Maragondon and not in the hamlet of Ternate.<br\/><br\/>As has been seen from the declaration made by the father provincial, Fulcheiro de Spilimbergo, there then existed an organization called by him <i>congregacion<\/i> or <i>hermandad<\/i>, and later <i>cofradia<\/i>, which assumed certain duties or rights in connection with the image.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the witnesses for the plaintiffs testified as follows in regard to the duties of the officers of the <i>cofradia:<\/i><br\/><blockquote>\"Q. On entering upon their duties, what work and obligations devolve upon the hermano mayor, majordomo and secretary who represented the <i>cofradia?<\/i>\u2014A. The <i>hermano mayor<\/i> is he who acts as president of the festivities on holidays, and solicits contributions from the public; the majordomo cares for and has the saint in his charge; it is the majordomo who takes the saint (to the church) before mass and afterwards brings it back.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. And the secretary?\u2014A. He keeps the papers of the alms of the saint.\"<\/blockquote>There is no doubt that at least as late as 1803 the <i>Santo Ni\u00f1o<\/i> was kept in the parish church of Maragondon. There is some doubt as to the custom relating to the celebration of the festival of the saint with reference to the number of days during which it was exhibited in Ternate. The writer above referred to says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every year, on the 31st of December, the day before the holiday, the <i>Mardicas<\/i> went to Maragondon to get their precious patron. The day following they took it out on the water, celebrating the most animated pilgrimage, with great shouting and war dances in the evening; afterwards they returned the patron to the church of that town which is about half a league away.\"<\/blockquote>The <i>hermano mayor <\/i>of the <i>cofradia<\/i> in his petition of1797 said :<br\/><blockquote>\"That it being the customo *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * the Mardicas who garrison the <i>Barra<\/i> of the said town of Maragondon to celebrate the day of the Circumcision of the Child God, whose image they took there on that day, assisted by innumerable devotees from various towns.\"<\/blockquote>The parish priest of Maragondon, in his report of December 16, 1797, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"That it is very certain that in the place called <i>Barra<\/i> of this town there exists a hermitage, built of grass and bamboo, and to which, once a year, the image of the Holy Child of Ternate is taken, and *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * in the parish church, and is placed in said hermitage on the eve of its <i>fiesta,<\/i> so that the faithful may adore it. They bring the said image from the town two days before the holiday, which is the day of the circumcision, and afterwards take it back on the evening of the day before his anniversary, in order to celebrate the holiday in that parish, since it is not celebrated in the hermitage. Such is the custom of the <i>Mardicas <\/i>here who have charge of and care for the <i>archicofradia <\/i>of the Holy Child\u2014\"<\/blockquote>and in another report of December 27, 1804, he stated\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"At the time I commenced to be curate thereof, I found a <i>cofradia<\/i> of the Holy Child, cared for and managed by the <i>Mardicas<\/i> who reside there *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * of this town, which image is in charge of and placed in the side altar of the church; by a custom which dates from their origin, they celebrate the fiesta in this church on the day of the circumcision with such circumstance that, in order to celebrate it, they first take it from here and carry it hidden to the place called<i> Barra<\/i> and place it in the hermitage there on the eve of the <i>fiesta<\/i>, so that the faithful who attend may adore it; on the evening of the same day they publicly return it to this town, and proceed with the celebration of the <i>fiesta<\/i>.\"<\/blockquote>Whatever may have been the custom prior to November 30, 1803, by the decree of that date made by the court of the vicar general (<i>juzgado provisoral<\/i>) permission was granted to the <i>Mardicas<\/i> to have the image exposed in the chapel of their barrio for the first five days of January, upon certain conditions, the sixth of which was as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Sixth. That the chapel shall always be closed at the termination of services when the Holy Child is not there, because it has to be returned to the church. At the termination of the holidays, one or two deputies are to be assigned to care for it, and to insure that there be not the least irreverence or profanation in such a holy place.\"<\/blockquote>The festival for that year was apparently so celebrated, but as the one for the next year approached, the parish priest of Maragondon and the inhabitants of the pueblo procured an order from the ecclesiastical authorities giving to the priest the right to suspend for that year the celebration in the barrio.<br\/><br\/>This he did. What took place when he made the announcement is best described in his own words when he reported the affair to the archbishop:<br\/><blockquote>\"ILLUSTRIOUS AND MOST REVEREND SIR: I can do no less than acquaint you with what has happened in this town. Having received your decision on the consultation made with respect to the celebration of the <i>fiesta <\/i>of the new year,I made it known to the <i>principales<\/i> of the town and the<i> Mardicas hermanos de la cofradia<\/i>. I asked them where they wished to celebrate the <i>fiesta<\/i> and they replied that it should be as ordered. I was of the opinion that it would be better to hold it in the town as being more decent and commodious for the purpose, and also for the sake of ancient custom, and I decided in view of the said instructions that the <i>fiesta<\/i> should be celebrated there. They all-appeared to be agreeable, and without any dissensions on either side, as were also the people and the <i>Mardicas<\/i> of the said <i>cofradia<\/i>. On the eve of the <i>fiesta <\/i>all was in readiness and vespers were about to be sung, when suddenly and without leave, there entered the church a number of <i>Mardicas<\/i>, provided with lances and other arms drawn from their scabbards, who drove the congregation from the church. They then ascended the altar, without any respect or fear of the Lord, and took away the Child with them to celebrate their <i>fiesta.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"All present were startled at the occurrence and were greatly frightened, especially the women and children, who screamed. We were all astonished and confused at such a rare occurrence and when I was told of the affair I ran to the choir to listen, but on arrival I found that they were already carrying off the Chfid Jesus in great haste. Thank God, however, that no other accident occurred, as the peor pie did not know of the affair until after it was over, and consequently offered no resistance.\"<\/blockquote>The views of the <i>Mardicas<\/i> were expressed in the report which their <i>hermano mayor<\/i> made of the occurrence to the archbishop.\u00a0 He said, among other things:<br\/><blockquote>\"The parish priest and the inhabitants of the town have always been opposed to the desires of the <i>hermanos <\/i>of said holy congregation. Their object is none other than to deprive the <i>Mardicas<\/i> of their right of preference to celebrate the fiesta in the hermitage erected in said barrio. The priest was influenced by the gifts of candles contributed by the faithful devotees of other districts and provinces and of those of the town interested in gambling in their houses and fattening their purses. Thus the poor <i>Mardicas <\/i>suffered from the persecution of the said priest and those of the town for this cause. *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The priest, carrying out his ideas *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 called the <i>hermanos de la cofradia<\/i>: He said that he was in receipt of an order communicated by Your Grace's secretary to alter the provisions of the said decree. The <i>hermanos<\/i> were surprised at the news, and seeing that in the evening of that day the vespers had to be held, they did not know what to do, as the priest said that the image of the Holy Child could only be taken to its hermitage before twelve o'clock, but at four o'clock it had to be returned to the church for vespers. In a respectful manner the <i>hermanos<\/i> represented to the priest that the hermitage was already decorated in anticipation of the celebration of high mass, the priest of San Roque having been called upon for the purpose and to preach. They received no consolation in their affliction, however, as the priest remained firm. The faithful devotees were in equal confusion, as all went to the hermitage, where last year the <i>fiesta <\/i>was held, and met with this unlooked-for result. Some remained while others returned home, as nobody gave the true explanation of the affair. The<i> Mardicas<\/i>, men and women, wept in the streets for their misfortune, clamoring at the top of their voices for the divine image, through whose intervention God had so often saved them from the hand of impious Moros. To such a degree did the sentiments of the unfortunate people attain, that some young men, doubtless induced by their fervent devotion to the divine image, that evening went to get it, and bring it to the hermitage; in order to avoid recognition they hid themselves from the elder folk, and particularly from the <i>hermanos de la cofradia,<\/i> who <i>afterwards essayed to return the image to the church<\/i>. Truly, only men that were blind with love and devotion such as they possess for their Divine Patron would undertake such a venture, as they risked their lives by a bloody opposition of the entire town of Maragondon. At tremendous risk, those youths, who it is said did not number more than seven, forgot their parents and their lives, merely to go and fetch the divine image and take it to its hermitage. They entered the church, not with the intention to give offense, but to suffer, and so it would seem that their action might be forgiven them, taking into account the reason for its commission.\"<\/blockquote>The order which gave the priest the right to suspend the decree of November 30, 1803, for the year 1804 only, provided that as to the future further action would be taken by the ecclesiastical authorities. The matter was referred to the assessor, who reported in favor of the <i>Mardicas<\/i>, advising the archbishop to order that \"the custom be followed in the celebration of the <i>fiesta<\/i> by the aforesaid <i>Mardicas<\/i>, the latter to conform to the orders given by the ecclesiastical judges on the said date of November 30, whose chapters they must observe.\" Such an order was made by the archbishop on March 6, 1805, and the <i>promotor fiscal<\/i>, on the 26th of March of the same year, gave an opinion to the same effect.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the record that the matter really in dispute was not as to whether the <i>Mardicas<\/i> were entitled to the permanent possession of the image, but as to whether the festival should be celebrated in the barrio or in the pueblo, and this question was decided in favor of the barrio. For it will be observed that the final judgment directed that the provisions of the decree of November 30, 1803, be observed, among which was the sixth condition, above quoted, by which the<i> Mardicas<\/i> were required to return the image to the church of Maragondon.<br\/><br\/>From that time more than fifty years passed, as to which period the record contains no written evidence. Where the image was during that time, does not appear. Witnesses in the .case, whose memory goes back to about 1855, say that, since their recollection, the image was not then in the church of Maragondon, but was kept in a box in a private house in the barrio by the majordomo of the <i>cofradia,<\/i> and that every Friday it was taken to the chapel, where it was worshipped.<br\/><br\/>About 1863 a church was built in Ternate and the image was immediately located therein, where it remained until 1896. At the outbreak in Cavite of the rebellion against Spain of that year, the parish priest, a native of the Islands, fled to the mountains and from that retreat ordered the president of the pueblo of Ternate to take the image from the church and bring it to the mountains. This was done and it there remained until the amnesty of 1897, when it was returned to the church of Ternate. It there remained until 1903, when a party of men, among whom were some of the plaintiffs, entered the church during the absence of the priest, seized the image, carried it out and placed it in a chapel of the Independent Filipino Church in the same pueblo of Ternate. Under orders of the executive branch of the Government it was taken therefrom by a military force of scouts, placed in the church of Maragondon, and the persons taking it from the church of Ternate were prosecuted for robbery. That case was dis missed, and the image ordered to remain in the custody of the Roman Catholic priest of Maragondon in the church of that pueblo until the right thereto could be determined in a civil judicial proceeding. Thereupon this action was brought.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs are thirteen in number.\u00a0 The complaint begins as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"United States of America, Philippine Islands, in the Court of First Instance of Cavite.\u2014No.\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014Nicomedes Iba\u00f1es, Bernardo Ramos, Pedro Zapanta, Pelagio Ninon, Andres Ninon, Victoriano Ramos, Hermenegildo Dinglay, Damaso Hernandez, Ciriaco Ramos, Cenon Zapanta, Baldomero Dionis, Rafael Ramos, Raymundo Salcedo, for themselves and in the name of the other inhabitants of the town of Ternate, plaintiffs, <i>vs.<\/i> the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church and its representative, the parish priest of Naic, Valentin Velasco, defendants, for the proprietorship of an image of the Holy Child.<br\/><br\/>\"The plaintiffs as expressed above, as inhabitants of the town of Ternate, for themselves and in the name of all the other inhabitants of said town, appear before the court and bring complaint against the defendants, alleging as a cause of action that:\"<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<\/div><\/blockquote>There are no other allegations in the complaint as to the right of the plaintiffs to represent the inhabitants of Ternate, nor is there any proof whatever in the case upon this point. The claim of the plaintiffs is that the persons who were at the time of the presentation of the complaint the inhabitants of Ternate were the owners in common of the image considered as a piece of personal property. There is no evidence to show that the present plaintiffs, or any one of the present inhabitants of Ternate, were the heirs or in any way related to any one of the two hundred <i>Mardicas <\/i>who came to the Philippines nearly two hundred arid fifty years ago. The claim of the plaintiffs is apparently not rested upon the proposition that they are entitled to relief because they are such heirs, but because they live in the pueblo. Their view seems to be that the heirs of the<i> Mardicas<\/i> living in other pueblos have no interest in the image.<br\/><br\/>Nor is there any evidence in the case to show how many, if any, of the plaintiffs or of the present inhabitants of Ternate, who are some 2,460 people, belong to the Roman Catholic Church. It will have been observed that, when the <i>Mardicas<\/i> came here, there came with them a priest of the Roman Catholic Church; that the image has always been used in connection with the worship of the religion professed by that church that the <i>cofradia<\/i> was an organization of that church, and by the terms of the decree of November 30, 1803, necessarily had to have as its rector a priest of that religion; that the disposition of the image has always been at the charge of the church's officers, and that recourse has always been had to them to determine any rights relating thereto.<br\/><br\/>Passing the question as to whether the Roman Catholic Church is not the owner of the image, the question may be asked, whether under these circumstances it can be said that any one has a proprietary right in this image who is not a Roman Catholic? If among the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Mardicas<\/span> who first came here there had been one who did not profess that religion, would he have had any participation therein? Are the Chinese who now live in Ternate part owners of the image? These are questions which we do not feel called upon to decide, for the case must be resolved upon the point made by the defendant at the very commencement of the action, to wit, that the thirteen persons named as plaintiffs have no right to maintain it.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs rely upon article 118 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"When the subject-matter of the controversy is one of common or general interest to many persons, and the parties are so numerous that it is impracticable to bring them all before the court, one or more may sue or defend for the benefit of all. But in such case any party in interest shall have a right to intervene in protection of his individual interests, and the court shall make sure that the parties actually before it are sufficiently numerous and representative so that all interests concerned are fully protected.\"<\/blockquote>No case has been called to our attention in which this section or the rule which it enunciates has been applied where the ownership of personal property is involved and where it is claimed to belong to persons who at a particular time reside in a particular place, or where the ownership changes as persons move in or out of such locality.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Macon &amp; Birmingham Railroad <i>vs.<\/i> Gibson (85 Ga., 1; s. c. 21 Am. St., 135), it appeared that the railroad, in accordance with the terms of its charter, if it built its railroad within 5 miles, of the town of Thomaston, had to build it within the corporate limits, or within 1 mile of the court-house. It was there held that two citizens of the town had a right to maintain a suit in behalf of themselves and of their fellow citizens, to prevent the railroad from violating its charter. The court said that the object of the provision in the charter was to prevent the decline and decay of the town in consequence of having a railroad in the vicinity but not near enough to prevent some rival town from springing up, and that the citizens of Thomaston had a peculiar and vital interest therein. It will be seen that in this case the ownership of personal property was not involved.<br\/><br\/>The case of Wheelock <i>vs.<\/i> First Presbyterian Church (119 Cal., 477), did involve the ownership of certain property and two persons were allowed to bring the action in behalf of others, but it there appeared that the persons who belonged to the Central Presbyterian Church, and whom the two plaintiffs represented, numbered 369 and were well known. In other words, that they were the members of a well-defined unincorporated society. The case of Smith <i>vs.<\/i> Swormstedt (16 How., 288), involved the division of the Methodist Church of the United States into two bodies, Methodist Church North and Methodist Church South. The matter in controversy was a property known as The Book Concern.\u00a0 The only persons interested in this property were the preachers belonging to the two churches, of whom there were about 1,500 in the Church South and about 3,800 in the Church North. These persons were well known and could be identified, and six of the preachers belonging to the Church South were allowed to maintain the action for themselves and for all their fellow preachers in that body. It will be seen that no one of these three cases is like the present one, wherein no one of the inhabitants of Ternate has a vested interest in the property in question which would survive his removal from the town and in which another person, by moving into the town, acquired an interest.<br\/><br\/>But even if this section were applicable to such a case as the present, the action could not be maintained. In the case of Smith vs. Swormstedt, above cited, the court said, at page 303:<br\/><blockquote>\"In all cases where exceptions to the general rule are allowed, and a few are permitted to sue and defend on behalf of the many, by representation, care must be taken that persons are brought on the record fairly representing the interest or right involved, so that it may be fully and honestly tried.\"<\/blockquote>In Macon &amp; Birmingham Railroad <i>vs.<\/i> Gibson, above cited, the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is true that as only two of the citizens have become parties, it is rather a small representation of the whole community; but considering the publicity of the case and of the interest involved in it, and the fact that the suit is located in Upson County and will be tried (if tried at all) at the county town, which is the town whose citizens are interested, there can be no cause to apprehend that the two plaintiffs on the face of the petition will be disposed, or if so disposed, allowed to misrepresent the community in whose behalf they have brought this suit, No doubt it is somewhat discretionary with a court of equity as to how many representatives of a class will, or ought to be, regarded as a fair representation of the whole class in the given instance.\"<\/blockquote>It sufficiently appears from the record in this case that it is a controversy between the Roman Catholic Church on one side and the Independent Filipino Church on the other. That it is the purpose of the plaintiffs, if they secure possession of the image, to place it in the chapel of the Independent Church is also very clear. What number of the inhabitants of the town (2,460 according to the census) are members of the Roman Catholic Church and what part are members of the Independent Filipino Church does not appear. But it is very apparent that many of the inhabitants are opposed to the transfer of the image from the Roman Catholic Church.\u00a0 Under the circumstances, the thirteen plaintiffs do not fairly represent all of the inhabitants of the town.\u00a0 Their interest and the interests of some of the others are diametrically opposed. For this reason this action can not be maintained.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the defendants are acquitted of the complaint, with the costs of the first instance against the plaintiffs. No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, <\/i>and<i> Carson, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<\/div>",

Hence, we are not called upon to review the finding`s of the court below, and this decision will only dwell on the questions of law set up by the appellant's in the bill\u00a0 of errors which accompanies their brief.<br\/><br\/>Commencing with the second error in reference to the nature and character of the obligation contained in the document of indebtedness, it is sufficient for\u00a0 the purposes of this decision to say that, in accordance with the old laws\u00a0 in force in, this country prior to\u00a0 the enactment\u00a0 of the present Civil Code, when an obligation is pure, simple, and unconditional, and no particular day has been\u00a0 fixed for its fulfillment, payment of the same may be demanded ten days-after it is contracted.<br\/><br\/>From the liquidation of accounts that took place between the plaintiff and\u00a0 the defendants, there\u00a0 resulted a balance of P1,352.80 which\u00a0 the debtors bound themselves to pay, without\u00a0 fixing a day therefor, with interest at the rate of 10\u00a0 per cent per annum until paid, just as if they had\u00a0 received said sum on loan at the time of the liquidation whereby they became indebted.\u00a0 Not having paid it at the\u00a0 time, they executed the document by which they bound themselves to pay the creditor without fixing a date for payment, or any other condition.\u00a0 Although\u00a0 in accordance with the old laws and the doctrine or precept of article\u00a0 62 of the Code of\u00a0 Commerce, the parties bound should have met\u00a0 their obligation at; the expiration of ten days after the 20th of January,\u00a0 1907, nevertheless, under the provisions of the Civil Code, the payment of the obligation may be demanded at once, unless from the nature and circumstances thereof it may be inferred that it was the intention of the creditor to grant the debtors some extension of time, in which case the duration thereof should be fixed by the courts.\u00a0 (Art. 1128, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>It can not be inferred from the language of the said document that it was the intention of Urbano Floriano to grant the defendants any extension of time in the payment, the duration of which should be fixed by judicial authority; and inasmuch as a complaint\u00a0 was filed in court twenty-seven days\u00a0 after the obligation was executed, after\u00a0 payment had been demanded from\u00a0 the debtors, the latter have no right at all to claim an extension for\u00a0 the fulfillment of the obligation, the existence and legality of which they have\u00a0 expressly recognized.<br\/><br\/>Article 1113 of the Civil\u00a0 Code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every obligation,\u00a0 the fulfillment of which should not depend upon a future or uncertain event or upon a past event, unknown to the parties in interest, shall be immediately demandable.\"<\/blockquote>The document of indebtedness contains no term or condition whatever upon which depends the fulfillment of the obligation contracted by the debtors; therefore, there exists no motive or reason that would exempt them from compliance therewith.<br\/><br\/>The judgment entered by the court below, sentencing the defendants to pay the plaintiff the sum that they owe him together with interest thereon, must, of course be understood as having been imposed upon them jointly in accordance with the mutual character of\u00a0 the obligation contracted by the debtors; therefore, the decision of the court below is in accordance with the provisions of articles 1137 and 1138 of the Civil Code, and it can not be contended that each of them has been severally sentenced to pay the whole amount stated in the document of indebtedness, and for said reason the fourth error attributed to the judgment appealed from is not true.<br\/><br\/>As to the first and second errors imputed by the appellants to the said judgment, it\u00a0 is unquestionable\u00a0 that the plaintiff has made a material error in his\u00a0 writing of the 21st of March, 1907,\u00a0 by charging only the husband, one of the defendants, with default; such error is explicable however, in that the husband is the natural representative of his wife, but it has no importance in view of the fact that the complaint was Hied against both of them, and that they were both summoned.\u00a0 The judge below having discovered the\u00a0 mistake held both defendants to be in default, thus amending, to a certain extent, the erroneous charge of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The order of default of March 22 was complied with, and upon the necessary\u00a0 evidence being offered by the plaintiff, the judge below, without further formalities, since section 128 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not require any other than those observed in these proceedings, rendered judgment on the 30th of the same month, after proceedings in due form of law.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, and as the judgment appealed from is in accordance with the law, it is our opinion that it should be affirmed, with the costs against the appellants. So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Carson, Willard,<\/i> and <i>Tracey, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<\/div>",

BENITO CUSI ET AL., DEFENDANTS, BENITO CUSI, APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\"> In the early morning of March 19, 1906, Benito Cusi, chief of the municipal police of Bauan, Batangas, accompanied by the other accu0sed person, Juan Corona, and four more members of the municipal police under his command, went to the house of Mariano Macaraig, situated in the barrio of Natunuan, municipality of San Jose, of said province, because of a robbery that had been committed at Dagatan on the previous night, and in order to arrest the said Macaraig, who1, from reports received, was one of the thieves.\u00a0 When the two accused persons went to the house of said Macaraig, they found him sleeping in his room. Thereupon Benito Cusi woke him up and dragged him out of the room and commenced to hit him with the butt end of his revolver, compelling him to confess his guilt as one of the robbers who had assaulted some individuals on the highway the night before. After the arrested man, Macaraig, had passed out of the house, the defendant Cusi continued hitting him with a rifle, and because the maltreated man fell into a ditch he slapped and kicked him, and when he got up the other defendant, Juan Corona, struck him with the side of a bolo. Macaraig was then bound with a rope made of bamboo and conducted to the barrio of San Mariano, where he was again maltreated and exposed to the sun until noon of the said day. All of this was done in order to compel him to confess his guilt.<br\/><br\/>Honorata Arellano, Macaraig's wife, and a companion of the same, Domingo Atienza, witnessed part of the ill treatment, as did also Francisco Mitra, a lieutenant of the barrio who arrived at the place where Macaraig was being maltreated shortly after being called by a policeman by order of the accused Cusi, Macaraig was examined a few days later by the municipal physician, who found that he had several bruises and a circular wound on the arms, the effect of the tying, although the wound was not serious.<br\/><br\/>A complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal charging Benito Cusi and Juan Corona with the crime of coercion, and the corresponding proceedings were instituted; a demurrer to the complaint was overruled. The judge, after trial, rendered judgment on the 2d of November, 1906, sentencing Benito Cusi to the penalty of six months of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">arresto mayor,<\/span> to pay a fine of 1,500 pesetas, and in case of insolvency to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, which, however, should not exceed one-third of the principal penalty, and to pay the costs; the other defendant, Juan Corona, was acquitted. From said judgment Benito Cusi has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The crime defined by article 497 of the Penal Code, and qualified as coercion, has been fully proven in this case, as may be seen from the facts stated above, inasmuch as by means of violence and ill treatment Mariano Macaraig was compelled by the accused, Benito Cusi, to confess against his will that he was one of the thieves who assaulted Teofilo Garcia and Leandro Bulanhagui at the sitio of Dagatan, between the barrios of Pila and San Mariano, on the previous night, the 18th of March, 1906; the ill treatment of Mariano Macaraig, who1 was arrested in his house on the morning of the 19th following and by which he was obliged to make a confession, is testified to not only by himself but also by the wife and a companion of the injured person, and the lieutenant of the barrio of Natunuan who was called by a policeman by order of the accused, Benito Cusi, and who saw the accused and his companions on the road not far from the house of Macaraig when the accused Cusi still continued to illtreat him in order to compel him to confess his culpability.\u00a0 When Mitra, the lieutenant of the barrio, saw what the defendant was doing, he said, according to the witness, \"Why are you illtreating that man?\"\u00a0 The accused Cusi answered, \"He is a highway robber.\"\u00a0 The maltreated man then said, \"Mr. Councilor, I am an innocent man,\" to which the policeman replied, \"What councilor are you talking about when you are one of the highway robbers of Dagatan, and if you do not admit it we will kill you.\"\u00a0 The accused further said to Mariano Macaraig, \"If you do not say that you are one of the highway robbers I will shoot you;\" and the arrested man replied, \"Even if you shoot me I can not say anything because I am entirely innocent.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant then continued to maltreat him until he fell to the ground, and when he managed to get up lie was conducted at daylight to the barrio of San Mariano by order of the accused.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the denial and the exculpatory allegations of the defendant, as well as the declarations of the policemen and roundsmen who accompanied them, and of Teofilo Garcia and Leandro Bulanhagui, who it is said, were the victims of a robbery committed on the night previous to the arrest of Macaraig, the record contains complete proof of the culpability of the accused as the duly convicted author of the crime of coercion; notwithstanding the fact that his said witnesses affirmed his denial, that they had not seen him maltreating the arrested man for the purpose of compelling him to confess that he was one of the persons who robbed certain travelers at the sitio of Dagatan on the night of the 18th of March, such attestations can in no way invalidate the substantial and uniform testimony of the eyewitnesses, which testimony confirms the statements of the person who suffered the ill treatment inflicted for the exclusive purpose of forcing from him an acknowledgment and confession of guilt and participation in the robbery. This testimony is, moreover, corroborated by the examination made by a physician a few days after the affair.<br\/><br\/>The affirmations of the defense and the declarations of the witnesses of the accused, apart from being contra\u00addictory, are notoriously incompatible with the result of the evidence of the prosecution, and with the existence of the bruises upon the injured person. The record contains no data whatever to indicate that the wounds were inflicted at the cuartel of the Constabulary where Macaraig was taken a few days later. As appears at folio 94 of the record, counsel for the accused attempted to prove by means of the declaration of Sergeant Macario Sulit, of the Constabulary, that the party arrested and coerced, Mariano Macaraig, at the time when he was turned over to the said sergeant showed no bruises whatever on his body, but the said attorney gave up or waived such plea, because Sergeant Sulit stated that he was unwilling to testify, and then pointed out as evidence of the ill treatment received by Macaraig at the cuartel of Constabulary, the information filed by the fiscal against said Sergeant Sulit and others; but this last pretension of the defense was overruled by the court.<br\/><br\/>Even if it were true that Mariano Macaraig had also been maltreated at the cuartel of Constabulary by reason of the robbery imputed to him, the punishable act of which Benito Cusi is charged would be none the less true, for its commission appears fully proven in the case. One ill treatment must not be confused with another; such acts may have been performed one after the other, but the truth is that the charge against Benito Cusi is clearly proven in the case, and it was so considered by the trial judge in the judgment appealed from, which is declared to be in accordance with the law; the case of the other defendant, Juan Corona, can not be dealt with in this decision, for the reason that he was acquitted by the said judgment.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the imputation that the court erred when overruling the demurrer based on double jeopardy, the record does not show the nature of the complaint filed with the court of the justice of the peace, nor the facts stated in the same, nor that a trial was ever had; it appears that the hearing did not take place and was postponed to another day. Therefore, there was no regular trial in accordance with the law. On the other hand, there is no evidence to show that the complaint was an amended complaint, and not an original one as it appears in the record; hence there is no possible reason for this court to consider that the court below erred when over\u00adruling the demurrer based on double jeopardy.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, as we hereby do affirm the same, provided, however, that only one-half of the costs of the first instance, and all of the costs in this second instance, shall be imposed upon the defendant, with the accessory penalties of article 61 of the code.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

It appears to have been of the depth of 5 <em>brazas,<\/em> and the entire lot occupied in connection therewith to have had a depth of 8 <em>brazas,<\/em> which left in the neighborhood of 3 <em>brazas<\/em> of land adjoining the street on the east, apparently the property of Lucas. The plaintiffs, his heirs, bring this action to recover his lot, or so much thereof as remains, from the defendant, the owner of the adjoining property on the eastward who, in 1905, included it with his property, placing a house upon it. The evidence is conflicting as to what was done with the remnant of Lucas's land in the intervening years, the plaintiffs testifying that they had fenced it and kept it clean, while the defendant claims that it had been unoccupied and had been abandoned by the former owner. <p>Whatever the plaintiffs may have done on the land in question after the death of their father, it is clear from the evidence that he, in his lifetime, made no further claim to it. On the contrary, in 1891, when Juan Florentino Abinez, the father of the defendant, was buying the adjoining property, a survey was made of it under the direction of Lucas Alconaba as first judge, who, together with the second judge, measured the land, while the clerk made the plan of it by their direction. This plan shows that it extends from the land of Juan Veros in a westerly direction a distance of 26 <em>varas<\/em> and 1 <em>palmo<\/em> to the street, thus including the remnant of Lucas's land. Not only did he take part in this survey, but as a witness he signed the document transferring the title from the former owners to Abinez. This action is entirely inconsistent with any claim on his part to a portion of the land thus described and conveyed and more than counterbalances the uncertain evidence of the plaintiffs as to their continuous claim and occupation of the property sued for.<\/p> <p>Even in relation to real estate, similar action, amounting to a disavowal of a claim on which the other party relied and on the faith of which he incurred expense, has been in some jurisdictions held sufficient to constitute a strict estoppel.<\/p> <p>The judgment of the Court of First Instance is affirmed, with costs of this instance against the appellants.

As to the first error assigned in her brief in this court, it is sufficient to say that it nowhere appears in the bill of exceptions that the\u00a0 amended complaint was not filed within the time fixed by the court in its order sustaining the demurrer.\u00a0 The only allegation which the bill of exceptions contains with reference to that\u00a0 matter, is\u00a0 an allegation that the defendant was not notified that the complaint had been amended until long after\u00a0 the time therefor had elapsed, but this falls far short of the statement that the amendment was not, in fact, made within the time.<br\/><br\/>The second assignment of error reaches the merits of the case.\u00a0 The defendant testified that she never placed her mark upon the document in question and never authorized anyone to sign\u00a0 it for her.\u00a0 Upon this point the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the plaintiffs.\u00a0\u00a0 It is true that Guillermo Gorgollo, whose name appears as a witness upon the document, stated that he remembered nothing about the transaction.\u00a0 His testimony was taken by deposition, from\u00a0 which it appears that the document was\u00a0 not presented to him, and he himself stated that he could not tell whether his signature thereto was genuine without seeing\u00a0 the instrument.\u00a0 The alleged difference in the color of the ink used in the document itself\u00a0 and that used in the signatures is sufficiently explained by the testimony\u00a0 of\u00a0 witnesses who say that the\u00a0 instrument was written by a clerk at one table and then was taken to another table, where it was signed.\u00a0 The testimony of the defendant's witnesses tended\u00a0 to show that the P10,900 was not paid to the defendant herself, but to her daughter, and it is stated in the defendant's brief that the daughter spent the money herself.\u00a0 This statement is not borne out by the evidence, because while the daughter testified that she received the money from the plaintiffs, she also testified that she immediately delivered it to her\u00a0 mother, the defendant.\u00a0 It is to be\u00a0 observed, moreover, that the complaint contained a copy of the note in question, and there was in the answer no denial of its execution, under oath, as required by section 103 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>The third error assigned relates to the protest of the note.\u00a0 In order to keep alive the obligation of the defendant, it was not necessary that this instrument should be protested.\u00a0 (Pyle <i>vs.<\/i> Johnson, 9 Phil. Rep., 249.)<br\/><br\/>The claim that the instrument is a commercial document can not be sustained.\u00a0 The following statement occurs therein: \"Value received from said gentlemen in cash to my entire satisfaction and as a loan to meet my requirements.\"<br\/><br\/>The evidence shows that\u00a0 the parties thereto were not merchants and there was no evidence that the money was actually used in commercial operations.\u00a0 (Arts. 311 and 532 of the Code of Commerce; Noel <i>vs.<\/i> Lasala, 5 Phil.

The patent recites\u2014<br\/><blockquote> \"Whereas Don Pablo Zamora y del Corro, curate and rector of the parish of the Sagrario of this city, as administrator of the lands belonging to the hacienda of<i> Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Guia, <\/i>has petitioned for an adjustment with the Government for four parcels of land\u2014\"<\/blockquote>and in the latter part thereof is found the following declaration :<br\/><blockquote> \"I issue this title, in order that, by virtue thereof, Don Pablo Zamora y del Corro may be regarded as the lawful owner of the\u00a0 above-mentioned parcels of land, as the administrator of the lands of the hacienda of<i> Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Guia.\"<\/i><\/blockquote>This grant did not make Don Pablo Zamora the owner of the property, but it did make owner thereof the person whose administrator he was.\u00a0 The evidence in the case shows that that person was the <i>Parroquia del Sagrario de la Catedral de Manila,<\/i> as\u00a0 is indicated in the patent itself, whose existence dates from 1587 and which, according to indications in the case, had been in possession of this land since the beginning of the eighteenth century.<br\/><br\/>This action was commenced against a great many\u00a0 defendants to eject them from the premises and\u00a0 for a declaration as to the ownership thereof.\u00a0 Judgment\u00a0 was rendered in favor of the plaintiff and certain of the defendants have appealed.<br\/><br\/>The appellants made no defense in the court below upon the merits of the case.\u00a0 No evidence was introduced\u00a0 by them\u00a0 which showed that they had any interest in the property except that of mere occupancy.\u00a0 They have, however, raised in this court several objections as\u00a0 to\u00a0 the form of the action and as to the personality of the plaintiff. The title of the action is as follows:<br\/><blockquote> \"Mgr. Jeremiah J. Harty, metropolitan archbishop of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church of Manila, plaintiff, <i>vs.<\/i> Francisco Sandin et al., defendants.\",<\/blockquote>The complaint contains the following allegations:<br\/><blockquote>\"That the plaintiff,\u00a0 Mgr. Jeremiah J. Harty, is the archbishop and\u00a0 the administrator of the property of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church of the diocese of Manila, P. I., and he has, therefore, the right\u00a0 to represent, administer, and possess the said lands, including the one which is the subject-matter of this action, which he is entitled to institute in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>\"That the parish of the <i>Sagrario<\/i> of Intramuros of the city of Manila is the absolute owner of several parcels of land,\u00a0 and has been in possession of the same as such owner.\"<\/blockquote>The prayer of the complaint is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"We request the\u00a0 court\u00a0 to render judgment declaring that the said tracts of land, which constitute the hacienda called <i>Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Guia,<\/i> being the sole and exclusive property of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, of the district of\u00a0 Intramuros, all and every one of the defendants should be sentenced to be ejected from\u00a0 the said lands illegally occupied by them, and to pay the costs of this suit, and we pray also this honorable court to grant us any\u00a0 other remedy which may be deemed just and equitable.\"<\/blockquote>The appellants claim that this action is brought by Archbishop Harty as an individual.\u00a0 A reading of the foregoing quotations from the complaint is sufficient to answer this contention.<br\/><br\/>The appellants apparently claim, also, that the Roman Catholic Church is not a juridical person and can not maintain any action in the courts of these Islands, not having complied with the corporation law.\u00a0 This contention was made in the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Ponce <i>vs.<\/i> The Roman\u00a0 Catholic Apostolic Church of Porto Rico (28 Sup. Ct. Rep., 737; 6 Off. Gaz., 1213), and was there overruled.\u00a0 See also Barlin <i>vs.<\/i> Ramirez\u00a0 (7 Phil. Rep., 41).<br\/><br\/>The appellants also apparently present the question as to whether the archbishop can maintain this action in his capacity as such, or whether it should not be brought in the name of the church,\u00a0 or in the name of the parish for whose benefit the grant of land was made.\u00a0 The Porto Rico case was commenced by the Roman Catholic Church in Porto Rico through the bishop of that diocese, and apparently was such an action as this one.\u00a0 In that case the Supreme Court said\u00a0 (6 Off. Gaz., p. 1216):<br\/><blockquote>\"The history of Porto Rico and its legal and political institutions up to the time of its annexation to the United States are matters which must be recognized by this court as the ancient laws and institutions of many of our States when matters come before it from their several jurisdictions.<br\/><br\/>\"The court will take judicial notice of the Spanish law as far as it effects our insular possessions.\"<\/blockquote>There was evidence in the case, moreover, that the archbishop was the supreme\u00a0 head of the church in his diocese and that, in accordance with the canonical law, he had the right to maintain such an action as this relating to the property of a parish in his diocese.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J.,\u00a0 Torres, Mapa;<\/i> and <i>Carson, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><br\/>TRACEY, J., <i>dissenting<\/i>;<br\/><br\/>I dissent on the ground that the action was improperly brought in the name of the archbishop. <\/div>",

The timber bulkhead will be reinforced with a riprap revetment against the outside and deposited in such a manner and at such times as will protect the structure against\u00a0 failure from pressure of the mud filling.<br\/><br\/>\"5. <i>The contractor will be responsible for all\u00a0 damages to the bulkhead and the revetment arising from wave action or from pressure of the revetment against the timber structure; but if a break is occasioned by pressure resulting from the mud filling, repairs to the structure will be paid for by the Government at prices specified in the contract, providing that the\u00a0 specifications have been\u00a0 fully complied with.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"12. *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *All losses of dredged materials from the fills, except those due to failure of the bulkhead from pressure of\u00a0 the mud fill, as stated in article 5,\u00a0 will be measured as\u00a0 carefully as conditions will permit and computed amounts deducted from the final\u00a0 payment.\"<\/blockquote>The complaint alleged: <br\/><blockquote>\"That on the said 1st day of May, 1906, and while the said improvements were in a condition as\u00a0 provided for in said contract, plan, and specifications,\u00a0 a section of about 200 feet in length of the said bulkhead and rock revetment was displaced\u00a0 by the pressure from\u00a0 the\u00a0 inside fill and moved a distance of about 20 feet into the waters of the Hay of Manila, and that through the opening thus caused there escaped into the\u00a0 bay a large quantity of the fill that had been pumped behind the said bulkhead: that after the break in the bulkhead\u00a0 and rock revetment of May 1, 1906, the plaintiff\u00a0 proceeded as rapidly in the repairing of the said bulkhead and revetment as it was permitted to do by the officer in charge\u00a0 representing\u00a0 the defendant, and in strict and immediate compliance with\u00a0 the\u00a0 orders received from\u00a0 the said officer in charge in that behalf; that thereafter\u00a0 and on the 18th\u00a0 day of May, 1906, before the aforesaid break in the bulkhead\u00a0 and\u00a0 revetment\u00a0 had been or could have been repaired,\u00a0 a severe typhoon\u00a0 occurred in the 15av of Manila;\u00a0 that\u00a0 the said bulkhead and rock revetment, being without support of the inside\u00a0 fill, which had escaped through the said break, were greatly damaged and completely destroyed for a distance of about\u00a0 1,800 feet by the pressure of the rock revetment and the wind and waves from\u00a0 the outside acting against\u00a0 the bulkhead and revetment, which, because of the escape of the heretofore-noted nil, was without support from the inside; that during and after the destruction of the bulkhead and revetment, caused as aforesaid,\u00a0 a large additional quantity of the inside fill escaped into the Hay of Manila.\"<\/blockquote>Plaintiff further alleges the fact to be that if the break in the bulkhead and rock revetment of May 1, 1906, caused as aforesaid by the pressure of the inside fill, had not occurred, then no damage whatever would have been done to said improvements, bulkhead, rock revetment, or\u00a0 fill by the typhoon of May 18-19, 1906, since the said bulkhead and\u00a0 rock\u00a0 revetment, when in the condition as provided\u00a0 for in said contract, plan, and specifications, with the fill on the inside always about even\u00a0 with the rock revetment on the outside and both the fill and the rock revetment being about 4 feet above mean low-water mark, would have been sufficiently strong to resist the force of the wind and waves.<br\/><br\/>Upon this demurrer these allegations must be accepted as established facts, except in so far as they are statements of the contents or effect of the original contract and specifications annexed to the complaint.\u00a0 These documents, themselves,\u00a0 of course, control the mere recital of their tenor.<br\/><br\/>A supplementary contract was made between the same parties\u00a0 bearing date May 24, 1906, containing a recital of the provisions of the first contract, together with the following clauses:<blockquote>\"Whereas, on the 1st day of May, 1906, a break in the bulkhead and revetment occurred caused by pressure result ing from the mud fill so that the repairs thereby made necessary ought to\u00a0 be paid\u00a0 for by the Government in accordance with paragraph\u00a0 five of said\u00a0 specifications; and<br\/><br\/>\"Whereas it has been determined that the repair's to the structure ought to be made, not by the construction of a new bulkhead of timber and replacing\u00a0 of the revetment of stone, as contemplated in said contract, but it lias been found advantageous and necessary to\u00a0 modify the project so that the repairs should\u00a0 be made by filling the space that has given way with rock and by filling the interstices of such rock with clay, soil, gravel, or\u00a0 broken stone, so that the water pumped into the fill would not flow through it and thus escape, and by the erection on the top of the rock so constructed of a temporary timber bulkhead, and that such change in the character of the repairs to be made would either increase or diminish the cost of the work; and<br\/><br\/>\"Whereas it has been ascertained that to fill the space made by the giving way\u00a0 of the previously\u00a0 existing\u00a0 bulkhead\u00a0 would require approximately\u00a0 3,000\u00a0 tons, more or less, of stone; 1,500 tons more or less of clay, soil and gravel, or broken stone, and 200 lineal feet, more or less, of temporary timber bulkhead.\"<\/blockquote>It then provided:<br\/><blockquote>\"That the repairs aforesaid required to be made by the Government of the Philippine Islands, in accordance with paragraph five of said specifications shall be made in the manner\u00a0 above stated instead of in the manner provided in said paragraph five of said specifications, and shall be made by the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Company, and that the expense of such\u00a0 repairs shall be paid for by the Government of the Philippine Islands at the actual and reasonable cost thereof, plus 15 per cent.\"<\/blockquote>On May 26, 1906, the\u00a0 Government engineer addressed the following communication to the plaintiff:<br\/><blockquote><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"MAY 26, 1906.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"THE ATLANTIC, GULF AXD PACIFIC COMPANY, <i>Manila,<\/i> P. I<br\/><br\/>\"GENTLEMEN: The following telegram was sent to Commissioner Forbes on May 25, 1906:<br\/><br\/>\" 'FORBES, <i>Baguio:<\/i><br\/><br\/>\" 'For most of typhoon damage I hold contractors responsible ; they claim Government responsible for all\u00a0 on account delay repairing first break, but wish to\u00a0 make repairs in manner authorized for first break, leaving settlement of liability to be determined later.\u00a0 Repairs should be made at once, but in view of contract requirement that no payments shall be made unless agreement is approved before obligation is incurred do not see how contractors can be authorized proceed before determination of liability. What action is desired?<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\" FISK'.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"To the above wire the following reply has this day been received:<br\/><br\/>\" 'Baguio, May 25, '06.<br\/><br\/>\" 'FISK <i>Port Works, Manila<\/i>:<br\/><br\/>\" 'Governor-General and I approve authorizing contractors to proceed immediately to make repairs on lines indicated, with the understanding that all rights reserved in regard to adjudication of liabilities.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\" 'FORBES.'<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"In accordance with the above, you are authorized to proceed to make repairs to the break in the Luneta Extension bulkhead in the manner outlined in supplement agreement entered into between\u00a0 yourselves\u00a0 and\u00a0 the Insular Government on May 24, 1906.\"<\/blockquote>It being conceded that the Government Mas to pay for the damage to the breakwater on May 1, the question presented to us is, Who is\u00a0 to stand the consequences of the typhoon of May 18-19?\u00a0 As a general principle, in the absence of express agreement, the\u00a0 contractor must bear the loss from destruction of work under way,\u00a0 even in case of unavoidable accident, the rule in this jurisdiction being expressed in article 1589 of the Civil Code as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"If the contractor is obliged to furnish the material, he must suffer the loss in case of destruction of the work before delivery, unless delayed by the party who was to accept.\"<\/blockquote>In this instance, however, the parties have not left their liability to the general principles of law, but have made their own rule, dividing the responsibility so that while the contractor should remain answerable for all damage from outside pressure on the structure from wave and rock revetment, the Government\u00a0 assumed charge of repairing the breaks caused by pressure from the inside fill.\u00a0 Were we called upon to interpret only this last undertaking of the Government, separated from its context,\u00a0 then the inquiry\u00a0 would simply be what must be considered the true cause of the giving way of the bulkhead, what is\u00a0 termed in American cases the proximate cause, not implying, however, as might be inferred from the word itself, the nearest in point of time or relation, but rather the efficient cause, which may be the most remote of an operative chain. It must be that which sets the others in motion\u00a0 and is to be distinguished from a mere preexisting condition upon which the effective cause operates, and must\u00a0 have been adequate to produce the resultant damage <i>without the intervention of an independent cause<\/i>.\u00a0 (Insurance Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Boon, 95 U. S., 117, 130, and 133; Scheffer <i>vs.<\/i> Railroad Co., 105 U. S., 249; St. Louis\u00a0 I. M. &amp; S. R. Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Commercial Ins. Co., 139 U, S., 223, 237; Washington &amp; G. Hailway Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Hickey, 166 U. S., 521; The G. R. Booth, 171 U. S, 450.)<br\/><br\/>It is to be noted that in these cases and throughout this opinion\u00a0 the terms \"cause\" and \"condition\" are used in their English acceptation rather than that of the Spanish civil law.<br\/><br\/>Obviously in the present case such a proximate cause of the accident was either the typhoon of May 18 or the pressure of the mud fill producing the earlier break of May 1.\u00a0 Considering the undertaking of the Government only and disregarding that of the contractor, the typhoon could not\u00a0 be\u00a0 considered an independent\u00a0 cause, for the reason that it was within the scope\u00a0 of the contract itself, one\u00a0 of the general\u00a0 objects of which in the clause under consideration was to provide against the consequences of such events.\u00a0 Nor for\u00a0 a like reason\u00a0 would the absence of the sustaining\u00a0 mud fill be regarded\u00a0 as\u00a0 a mere\u00a0 disconnected condition, but rather as a connecting cause,\u00a0 as it was the direct result of overpressure from within, through the fault of\u00a0 one of the parties, for which the contract expressly furnished a remedy.\u00a0 As a consequence\u00a0 we should be led to the conclusion that the proximate cause of the damage was not the typhoon, one of the contingencies\u00a0 provided against in the contract, but rather the\u00a0 overpressure of the fill,\u00a0 producing the escape of material and the weakness of the bulkhead, which rendered the destruction by the typhoon possible.\u00a0 But when we come to consider the effect of the counter undertaking of the company, we find the terms of the obligation and the relation of the parties changed.\u00a0 Between this primary cause and its ultimate effect, they have chosen to interpose an independent cause.\u00a0 Storms, typhoons, and external wave pressure are not left\u00a0 as foreseen contingencies to\u00a0 which other agencies\u00a0 might be attributed as causes, but are\u00a0 constituted in themselves independent causes of any damage that may result, for the consequences of which the contractor expressly agrees to be responsible.\u00a0 For such is the necessary effect of the words \"The contractor will be responsible for all\u00a0 damages to the bulkhead and\u00a0 the revetment arising from wave action\u00a0 or from pressure of the revetment against the\u00a0 timber structure.\"\u00a0\u00a0 They recognize exterior\u00a0 pressure as an independent agent of any injury that might occur therefrom.\u00a0 In other terms\u00a0 the injuries to the breakwater, resulting from the typhoon, might be said to have as their proximate cause the\u00a0 anterior over- pressure from within, producing the damaged condition following the break of Mny\u00a0 1, had\u00a0 not the contractor stipulated to be responsible for all damages arising from pressure from without, by such stipulation constituting such external pressure a separate and an independent as it was clearly an intervening cause, for which he assumed the responsibility.\u00a0 It is plain that had\u00a0 there been no pressure from the typhoon no injury\u00a0 would have resulted from lack of the sustaining mud fill which had escaped. The break was immediately occasioned by wave action and the outside pressure of the typhoon.\u00a0 The contractor expressly agreed to answer for all\u00a0 damages from\u00a0 this source and the effect of this branch of the stipulation is, while changing into a preexisting condition what without it would have been a connecting cause, to convert into an independent cause for which the contractor is liable that which\u00a0 otherwise would have been a casualty within the purview of the contract.<br\/><br\/>In support of this view of the subject it must be borne in mind that the liability of the Government is narrowed by two important limitations: First, it does not extend to all kinds of damage, but only to repairs of any break in the\u00a0 bulkhead; and second, to such a break only when resulting from pressure from within and not from lack of such\u00a0 pressure.\u00a0 This furnishes a strong suggestion that what the parties had in mind was not the remote consequence of a damaged structure but rather the immediate repair of any break that might occur, thus looking separately to each particular break and its immediate cause.<br\/><br\/>The rules for the interpretation of contracts are found in Chapter IV of Title II of Book IV of the Spanish Civil Code, where, in article 1282, the elementary principle that contracts are to be interpreted in accordance with the intention, as shown by the acts of the parties, is expressly enjoined upon us as a primary canon of construction, in these words:<br\/><blockquote>\"In order to judge of the intention of the contracting parties regard must be had <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">principally<\/span> to their acts, both contemporaneous and subsequent to the contract.\"<\/blockquote>We need not resort to conjecture as to what their acts in this case might have been, for we find them expressed in the\u00a0 supplemental contract of May 24.\u00a0 At\u00a0 that time the first break was more than\u00a0 three weeks old and\u00a0 five days\u00a0 had passed since the damage from the typhoon was apparent; nevertheless, in this agreement, reciting the occurrence of May 1, and purporting to completely provide for its consequences, it is stated that to fill the space made by the giving way of the bulkhead would require approximately 3,000 tons of stone, 1,500 of clay or similar material, and 200 lineal feet\u00a0 of timber, these quantities\u00a0 answering evidently\u00a0 to the immediate need of the break of May 1, whereas the repairs necessitated by the typhoon, as stated in the complaint, called for 15,000 tons of rock, 116,000 cubic tons of fill, and other items.\u00a0\u00a0 Had it been on the 24th of May in the minds of these parties that\u00a0 the repairs to the second break were\u00a0 to be considered part of the resultant damage of the\u00a0 first break, is\u00a0 it possible that they should have omitted from their computation the greater amounts, overlooking them\u00a0 while specifying the lesser results of the earlier accident?\u00a0 Had they then interpreted their contract as imposing on the Government the liability for the injuries\u00a0 of May 18-19, it is to be presumed that they would have so stated, or at least that the question would have been reserved for future settlement.\u00a0 It was only after the execution of this agreement that a claim was made that the Government was responsible for the effect of the typhoon.\u00a0 It is apparent from the communication of the engineer that, as soon as stated, this claim was resisted, and that in order to expedite the work and avoid future damage, the reservation was\u00a0 made of liabilities for future adjudication.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, the contract of May 24, having gone into force\u00a0 prior to this reservation and independent of it, should in fairness be given its apparent effect of an adjustment of the damages\u00a0 suffered by the break of May\u00a0 1, and operate as a settlement of all claims existing\u00a0 when it was signed, five or six days after the typhoon.\u00a0 This view renders it unnecessary for us to determine\u00a0 whether the item of P27,840,\u00a0 the cost of replacing the fill behind the bulkhead, which enters into the damage sought by the plaintiff, as well as a proportional part of the item of P10,000 for labor, can be considered as a part of the \"repairs to the structure\" which alone the Government in any case agreed to pay for.<br\/><br\/>Our conclusion, therefore, is that interpreting this somewhat ambiguous contract in the light of the acts of the parties themselves, and giving effect to their agreement in settlement of the losses by the break of May 1, the plaintiffs have made themselves responsible for the damage by the typhoon and can not recover\u00a0 in\u00a0 this action.\u00a0 The judgment of the Court of First Instance must, therefore, be affirmed.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that all efforts made by the creditor to collect the\u00a0 same have proved useless, notwithstanding the fact that the time set for payment in the documents of indebtedness has expired;\u00a0 and\u00a0 that in view of the fact that the debtor, who formerly lived in the town of Kabankalan, and worked at the hacienda of San Lucas, came over to this capital (Bacolod), bringing with him his carabaos and other cattle, probably in order to conceal or sell them to the prejudice of the plaintiff's interests, the latter asked for a preliminary attachment of said animals for the reason that the case was included in section 412 of Act No. 190.<br\/><br\/>The attorney for the defendant demurred to the complaint on the ground that the Chinaman Sua Tico was absolutely unknown to the defendant, and the latter did not recollect ever having had any business relations with him or that he was indebted to him in the amount claimed; for said reason he asked that the case be dismissed with costs, and the preliminary attachment raised.<br\/><br\/>On the 14th of August of said year the plaintiff's counsel applied to the court for permission to amend the complaint by stating the name of the plaintiff to be Chua Tinco, <i>alias<\/i> Tima, instead of Sua Tico\u00a0 as had been erroneously given, basing his motion on section 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 On the 18th of August the court issued an order overruling the demurrer and allowing the amendment of the complaint\u00a0 asked for by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendant answered the complaint on the 23d of the said month of August, stating that between the plaintiff, Chua Tinco, <i>alias<\/i> Tima, otherwise known by the\u00a0 name of Chua Chienco, and the defendant Vargas, there existed a current account\u00a0 by reason of business transactions; that as a result of the liquidation made on the 7th or 8th of March, 1902, the defendant owed the plaintiff 700 pesos, which was set out in a <i>vale<\/i> or receipt signed by the debtor, who in turn took up other <i>vales<\/i> held by the creditor; that after the date above mentioned the defendant continued to obtain from the plaintiff other sums of money for which he issued the corresponding receipts or <i>vales<\/i>; that on the 18th of October, 16th of November, and 16th of December, 1902, respectively,\u00a0 the defendant drew three drafts against the firm of Hijos de I. de la Rama, of Iloilo, each for the sum of 500 pesos, for the purpose of settling\u00a0 his accounts; that the said drafts were collected by the plaintiff to be credited to the account of the defendant, who, after drawing the last mentioned draft ceased to obtain money\u00a0 from\u00a0 the plaintiff; that\u00a0 in\u00a0 the month of August, 1903, the plaintiff demanded from the defendant the payment of 82 pesos, which, according to his statement, the latter still owed him, but, as according to his reckoning it was the Chinaman who owed him, because he did not keep accounts other than his <i>vales<\/i>, he declined to pay, and demanded that he be shown the <i>vales<\/i> in order to settle the accounts.\u00a0 This was never acceded to by the plaintiff, who does not limit his complaint to claiming the 82 pesos, but demands 1,382.50 pesos, thus trying to defraud the defendant of the value of the three drafts of 500 pesos each that were drawn by him in payment of his debt: Therefore the defendant asked that the plaintiff be compelled to produce\u00a0 his vales in court for examination; that he (the plaintiff) be ordered to pay the resulting balance,\u00a0 with legal interest thereon from the 16th of December, 1902, together with indemnification for the damages to which he has been subjected by reason of the preliminary attachment, and costs, with the reservation of the right to the defendant to bring such criminal action against the plaintiff as might be proper.<br\/><br\/>On the same date (August 24), counsel for the plaintiff stated that in rebuttal of the defendant's answer he denied that the plaintiff was known by the name of Chua Chienco; he denied the contents of paragraph 4 of his answer, and also that he was indebted in any amount to the defendant, and asked that judgment be rendered as prayed for in his complaint.<br\/><br\/>On the 17th of September, 1904, counsel for the plaintiff asked permission to amend his complaint in respect to the name of the plaintiff who, besides the name of Chua Tinco and the nickname of Tima, is also known as Chua Chinco, or Chua Chienco, on account of the difference in pronunciation, and that he is also called by the\u00a0 nickname of Tima.<br\/><br\/>Evidence was adduced by both parties to the suit and their exhibits were made of record.\u00a0 On the 4th of March, 1907, the judge below rendered judgment ordering Angel Vargas to pay to the plaintiff the sum\u00a0 of 1,382 pesos, Mexican currency, or the equivalent thereof, at the rate of 1.25 Mexican for each Philippine peso, with legal interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 12th of July, 1904, until completion of payment, together with costs.\u00a0 The defendant excepted to the decision and moved for a new trial on the ground that the findings were contrary to the weight of the evidence; the motion was overruled and excepted to, whereupon the bill of exceptions was presented in due course by the defendant and brought to this court.<br\/><br\/>The following facts are proven by the record: that there had been business transactions between both parties during several months in the year 1902; that Vargas, by reason of\u00a0 certain sums that he\u00a0 obtained on various occasions from the plaintiff, Chua Chienco, <i>alias<\/i> Tima, owed the latter, according to a liquidation of accounts made\u00a0 in March of said year, the sum of 1,382 pesos, as proven by the <i>vales<\/i> produced at the trial and numbered 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\u00a0 These <i>vales<\/i> were admitted and recognized by the defendant, so that the existence of said debt, duly proven in the record is unquestionable.\u00a0 Proof that the obligation had been extinguished by its payment devolves upon the debtor who takes such exception to the claim of the plaintiff creditor filed in court.\u00a0 (Arts. 1156,1214, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>From the total amount of the indebtedness of 2,082.50 pesos there is deducted, in the account shown\u00a0 as exhibit 1, one <i>vale<\/i> for 50 cents (fol. 5), and the sum of 700 pesos which the plaintiff acknowledges to have\u00a0 received in\u00a0 part payment from the debtor; the balance, amounting to 1,382 pesos, is the sum claimed in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>It is alleged by the defendant that he had already paid his debt with\u00a0 the three drafts of 500 pesos each drawn by him in favor of the plaintiff on October 18, November 16, and December 16, 1902, on the firm of Hijos de I. de la Rama, merchants of Iloilo,\u00a0 and that by reason thereof he is even a creditor of the plaintiff for the\u00a0 difference between the two amounts.<br\/><br\/>This allegation is absolutely lacking in proof.\u00a0 On the contrary, it has been rejected and entirely contradicted by the plaintiff and his witness, Dian Congo, <i>alias<\/i> Onga, both of whom attest that the value of the\u00a0 drafts drawn in October and December was respectively paid in cash by the plaintiff upon receiving each of said\u00a0 drafts from the defendant, and with respect to the draft drawn in November, the plaintiff paid 400 pesos in cash, and credited the defendant's account with only 100 pesos; he further stated that there was only one liquidation made in March, 1902, as appears from document No. 1, and if the <i>vales<\/i>, attached to the account have not been returned to the debtor,\u00a0 it is because the latter has not paid the balance standing against him, and that as a matter of fact he was indebted to the plaintiff in the amount claimed in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The ordinary proceeding when acquiring bills of exchange or drafts, is, that the purchaser at the time\u00a0 they are issued, pays the drawer the value of the same.\u00a0 In the case at\u00a0 bar, if the defendant, Vargas, did actually draw said drafts of 500 pesos each on three different occasions in favor of the plaintiff in payment of his indebtedness for amounts received by him on prior occasions, and if the purchaser of the drafts did not pay him for the same, he, the defendant, should have requested the plaintiff for the corresponding receipt for the value of each draft; as he did not do so, there is no proof of this exception.<br\/><br\/>It is a strange thing that, as his debt consisted of five vales for different amounts, he did not take them up in the absence of a proper receipt, because if each time he obtained money from Chua Chienco he gave a vale for the same, it is inexplicable that, on the occasions that Vargas\u00a0 gave drafts in partial payment of his debt, he did not demand the return of some of the vales or a receipt therefor from the creditor.\u00a0 The record discloses that Vargas personally called at the store of the purchaser of the drafts and received\u00a0 from him the value of the same in cash on the three dates cited above, with the exception of the 100 pesos which were credited to him.<br\/><br\/>Article 1157 of the Civil Code reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"A debt shall not\u00a0 be considered as paid until the full amount of the thing has been delivered, or the prestation of which the obligation consisted\u00a0 has been made.\"<\/blockquote>The amounts received by the debtor and which he bound himself to pay to the creditor, have not been shown to have been refunded to the latter; therefore, under the law, it can not be considered that the debt in question has been paid, especially when the certainty and legality thereof appears proven by competent documents recognized by the debtor and kept by the creditor in his possession, they being for this\u00a0 reason equal in value to a public instrument so far as the debtor is concerned.\u00a0 (Art. 1225, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>For the above considerations, and inasmuch as the judgment appealed from is supported by the weight of the evidence,\u00a0 it is our opinion\u00a0 that the same should be affirmed,\u00a0 with the costs\u00a0 against\u00a0 the appellant.\u00a0 So\u00a0 ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.J., Carson, Willard, <\/i> and\u00a0 <i>Tracey, JJ.,<\/i>concur.<br\/><i>Mapa, J.<\/i>, did not sit in this case.<\/div>",

the case was proceeded with, and on the 20th of March, 1907,\u00a0 the judge of the district entered judgment, sentencing the accused as guilty of the said crime, by reason of<i> imprudencia temeraria<\/i> (reckless negligence), to the penalty of one year and eight months imprisonment with costs.\u00a0 From said judgment the accused has appealed.<br\/><br\/>Article 471 of the Penal Code reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any person who shall contract a second or subsequent marriage without the prior marriage being lawfully dissolved shall be punished with the\u00a0 penalty of<i> prision mayor<\/i>.\"<\/blockquote>From the proceedings it appears proven beyond the least shadow of doubt, that the accused, Nicolas Arceo, being lawfully married to Tranquilina Arcillas since\u00a0 the 3d of\u00a0 February, 1897, and without\u00a0 said marriage being dissolved, since his wife was still living,\u00a0 contracted another marriage on the 1st of May,\u00a0 1901,\u00a0 with Teodora de Quia, in the presence of the parish priest and witnesses in the town of Tamboboug, Province of Rizal, as shown by the canonical certificates which appear in the case.<br\/><br\/>There is no controversy in the proceedings with regard to the actual commission of the crime,\u00a0 The accused himself does not deny it; on the, contrary, he acknowledges that he contracted a second marriage in 1901 with Teodora de Guia.<br\/><br\/>The accused pleaded not guilty, and the only question set up by him is that, when he contracted the said second marriage, he did so under the firm belief that his first wife was dead.<br\/><br\/>The evidence in this case conclusively shows that the accused willfully, fraudulently and feloniously violated the law prohibiting bigamy, and contracted a second marriage without having positive and irrefutable proof of\u00a0 the death of his first wife.<br\/><br\/>The record shows that the accused separated from\u00a0 his wife, Tranquilina\u00a0 Arcillas, on account of their difference in temperament, but no matter how deep and radical may have been his disaffection, taking into consideration the knowledge and enlightenment displayed by the accused, since he defended himself without the assistance of a lawyer, he could never have overlooked the fact that, in undertaking a second marriage, when he was not sure of the death of his first wife, a grave affair was at issue, with serious and far reaching consequences to himself, his wife, and their legitimate children, because he was running the risk of violating a prohibitive law and\u00a0 thereby incurring grave penalties.\u00a0 But the accused was dominated by a new passion for another woman; he did not hesitate to violate the law by effecting the second marriage with malice and criminal intent, and expose himself to the consequences of his reprehensible act.<br\/><br\/>If it were true that Arceo sent two persons, Dalmacia Mendoza and Norberto Paras, to the town of Lubao for the purpose of finding out whether his first wife had really died, the letter he had received from his brother-in-law advising him\u00a0 of her death not satisfying him, it\u00a0 would not\u00a0 be unreasonable to conjecture that,\u00a0 considering his indifference toward the mother of his children, the sending of the above-named two persons to\u00a0 obtain\u00a0 the said information was really in order that he might be able to contract his desired second marriage all the sooner.<br\/><br\/>The best proof that the accused acted, not in good faith, but with malice when he contracted the second marriage, is afforded by the certificate offered in evidence as Exhibit B, issued by the curate of Tambobong.\u00a0 This certificate sets forth\u00a0 that\u00a0 when\u00a0 Nicolas\u00a0 Arceo appeared at the parish church of said town, he perverted the\u00a0 truth and told the curate that he was a bachelor and the son of Gonzalo and Alejandra Angeles, of the towns of San Fernando, Pampanga.\u00a0 If he had acted in good faith, the natural thing\u00a0 for him to have said was that he\u00a0 was a widower, if he really believed that his first wife, Tranquilina Arcillas, was dead.\u00a0\u00a0 He would likewise have stated that he was the son of Gonzalo Arceo Tan Utco, a Chinese Christian, and of Alejandra San\u00a0 Teco, both residents of the town of Bacolor, in the said province.\u00a0 The accused's false statement was sent by the priest to the bishop in charge of the metropolitan diocese when the application was made in the name of the accused for dispensation waiving the bans, in order that he might contract marriage with the said\u00a0 Teodora\u00a0 de Guia;\u00a0 it was further stated in the communication that Arceo was a bachelor; thus his actual status was concealed, or at least that he was a widower, as he claims to have been at that time.<br\/><br\/>It is inferred from all of this, that\u00a0 the accused had to deceive the second wife, Teodora de Guia, by inducing her to believe that he was a bachelor or a widower, if it is true that, prior to his marriage, he wore mourning for his first wife, as testified by some of his witnesses; he also deceived the curate of Tambobong by informing him that he\u00a0 was a bachelor because, if he had stated that he was a widower, the curate, in compliance with his duty and canonical rules, would have inquired as to who was his late wife, the place of their marriage and that of the death of the wife; that further he concealed the real citizenship, condition, and residence of his father and mother, who lived, not in San Fernando but in Bacolor, because he knew well enough that, if the only bans that were to be published were to be announced,\u00a0 not in the church of San Fernando but in that of Bacolor, the curate and the residents of Bacolor would undoubtedly become informed that the accused was about to contract another marriage in Tambobong, while his true and lawful wife was still living\u00a0 and perhaps residing at the time in Bacolor.\u00a0 Such conduct, on the part of Nicolas\u00a0 Arceo,\u00a0 unquestionably reveals malice and a fraudulent and criminal intent\u00a0 by contracting a second marriage when he positively knew that his lawful wife was not dead.<br\/><br\/>Deeds similar to the present have unfortunately been frequent of late years, on account of the disturbed\u00a0 state of the country.<br\/><br\/>The manner in which the lawful wife and her brother Roman Decena acted when testifing in this case, the former forgetting the anomalous conduct of her husband, shows ability and cleverness on the part of the accused, since, notwithstanding the injury inflicted upon the wife and her family, still he managed to induce her and his brother-in-law,\u00a0 out of compassion, to cooperate in his defense in order that he might escape from the hands of law and justice.<br\/><br\/>The letter written by the brother-in-law informing the husband of the\u00a0 death of his wife, and the explanations given by her and by her brother, the writer, must be presumed to be means craftily selected and planned by the\u00a0 defense to deliver the accused from the penalty incurred\u00a0 by him.<br\/><br\/>With such exculpatory allegations and this sort of evidence it is not possible to find that Nicolas\u00a0 Arceo contracted a second marriage in good faith,\u00a0 so that his liability may be\u00a0 limited to having committed the crime of bigamy through reckless negligence, as provided for in article 568 of the Penal Code; the contrary is proven by the evidence in the case.<br\/><br\/>Nicolas Arceo knew that he was attempting to commit an act that could not be justified before honest men; hence, in order to carry it into effect, he endeavored to conceal it from those who knew him, who knew that his own wife was living, and who\u00a0 could have prevented the consummation of the crime, with the circumstance that, even though both his own parents and the\u00a0 father of Tranquilina Arcillas were still living,\u00a0 he did. not want\u00a0 to apply to them, especially to his father-in-law, in order to find out with certainty if his first wife had really died in Lubao.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that, at the time when the accused intended to contract his second marriage, he was in better and more favorable circumstances than any other resident of San Fernando, with the exception\u00a0 of certain persons in authority, to ascertain whether or not his wife had died in Lubao, a town not far distant in the province, since he was interpreter to the military authorities in San\u00a0 Fernando; and considering his personal conditions, education and intelligence, he should have known that the hearsay information he received from the two persons he sent to Lubao to investigate the\u00a0 death of his wife, any more than the letter he had previously received from his brother-in-law, was not positive proof whereon to base a conviction of her actual death; and, even though the\u00a0 news was received\u00a0 by\u00a0 him with indifference in view of their mutual disaffection and lack of regard, intending, however, as he did, to contract another marriage, it must be assumed that he had a great interest in ascertaining the truth, and he should have employed all diligence in obtaining positive news regarding such death, though it were only in order that he might marry without violating the law; but, instead of using due diligence, such as prudence and common sense would dictate, he contented himself with hearsay news that Dalinacia Mendoza and Norberto Paras brought him,\u00a0 if indeed they made any investigation at all; and the accused, believing that the said hearsay information was sufficient, completed what was wanting by means of false and fraudulent acts in order to carry\u00a0 out his purpose of marrying Teodora de Guia.<br\/><br\/>As to the nature and character of the entries contained in the parochial books and the certificates thereof issued by the parish priest, it must\u00a0 be stated that the same have not lost their character of public documents for the purpose of proving such acts as\u00a0 are therein referred to, inasmuch as from\u00a0 the time of the change of sovereignty\u00a0 in these Islands to the present day, no law has been enacted abolishing the official and public character of parochial books and entries made therein under the provisions of the former laws; the parish priests continue to be the legal custodians of the parochial books kept during the former sovereignty, and\u00a0 as such they may issue certified copies of the entries contained therein in the same manner\u00a0 as do keepers of archives.<br\/><br\/>On this assumption, the authenticity of the marriage certificates attached hereto is unquestionable;\u00a0 their legitimacy has been duly established according to law, and, since no proof has been offered to the\u00a0 contrary, they constitute evidence of the crime and of the guilt of the culprit.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the first error assigned by the defense to the judgment appealed from, that it is no bar to the presentation of a new complaint for the same offense where a case is dismissed on account of the lack of\u00a0 jurisdiction of the\u00a0 court, without remanding the accused\u00a0 to the proper tribunal, and without directing that a new information be filed, it should be born in mind that, in accordance with section 23 of General Orders, No. 58, when a court considers or declares itself without jurisdiction, it is not\u00a0 necessary, in\u00a0 order that the case may be reopened, that the filing of a new complaint or information shall be directed, as it is not a question of admitting a demurrer.\u00a0 Therefore, in cases of lack of jurisdiction, the action of the court is null and void, the right of the Government to prosecute a crime subsists, and the action must be tried by the court having jurisdiction thereof. Therefore, since no valid trial was held, the accused was not exposed to danger and for this reason counsel for the accused\u00a0 Arceo can not allege the exception of double jeopardy, as in the second error imputed to the trial judge:<br\/><br\/>As to the third error, relative to the fact that the accused was held to\u00a0 be guilty\u00a0 through reckless negligence, it has been demonstrated by the foregoing considerations that Nicolas Arceo contracted a second marriage, not through recklessness, but with malice, bad faith, and the criminal intention of knowingly violating the law prohibiting the crime of bigamy; therefore, he has\u00a0 committed the real and specific crime of illegal marriage, since, notwithstanding the unproven allegations by which he sought to justify himself, the case contains decisive arid conclusive evidence to convince one of the guilt of the accused as the responsible author of the crime prosecuted herein.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime no mitigating nor aggravating circumstance is present; therefore,\u00a0 the penalty prescribed by the said article 471 of the code must be applied in its medium degree.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and Nicolas Arceo sentenced, as we hereby sentence him, to the penalty of eight years and one day of <i>prision mayor<\/i>, to the accessory penalties of article 61\u00a0 of\u00a0 said\u00a0 code,\u00a0 to indemnify Teodora de Guia in the sum of P300, in accordance with the provisions of article 480 of said code, without subsidiary imprisonment in\u00a0 case\u00a0 of insolvency in\u00a0 view of the serious nature of the penalty,\u00a0 and to pay the costs of both instances.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Containing 10,472.23 square meters of extension. Bearings magnetic.\"<\/blockquote>The said city alleged that it was the absolute owner of the said land; that said land was assessed by the city of Manila in the sum of $1,780, United States currency; that there existed no liens of whatever character against said land; that the land was unoccupied; that the said city obtained title to the said land by reason of being the successor to all the rights and actions of the old city of Manila (<i>ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i>), to which said property formerly belonged.<br\/><br\/>To this petition of the petitioner, the Insular Government presented the following opposition to the registration of said land:<br\/><blockquote>\"The Solicitor-General, representing the Insular Government, appears before the court, and states:<br\/><br\/>\"I. That the city of Manila, represented by its attorney, Modesto Reyes, requests that, in compliance with the Land Registration Act, a parcel of land situated in Paco, a district of this city, of which it claims to be the absolute owner, and the description of which is specified in the petition, be inscribed in its name.<br\/><br\/>\"II. That the land in question is the property of the Government of the United States under the control of the Insular Government,<br\/><br\/>\"III. That by virtue thereof, the Solicitor-General opposes the inscription asked for, and requests the court to deny the petition with the costs.\"<\/blockquote>To this petition of the petitioner one Geronimo Morales also presented the following opposition to the registration of a portion of the land described in the second paragraph of said petition:<br\/><blockquote>\"NOW comes the undersigned before this court and says:<br\/><br\/>\"1. That the city of Manila, by its attorney, Modesto Reyes, has, in conformity with the provisions of the Land Registration Act, applied for the registration of a certain parcel of land located in the district of Paco, of this city, of which it alleges sole and absolute ownership, and the description of which is included in the application.<br\/><br\/>\"2. That the plan and description of the said land as they appear in the petition are incorrect, for there is included in the same a part of a building lot belonging to the undersigned, and situated in the barrio of Rosario of said district, with an area of 84 meters more or less, as will be seen in the plan to be filed later.<br\/><br\/>\"3. Therefore, the undersigned files his opposition to the registration applied for, as far as it has any bearing on the building lot of the undersigned which is included in the plan and description of the applicant, and this honorable court is requested to deny the application as far as it relates to the said building lot, with the costs against the petitioner.\"<\/blockquote>After the presentation of the petition on the part of the said petitioner, one of the examiners of titles of the Court of Land Registration made an examination of the title claimed by the petitioner and made the following report to the judge of the said Court of Land Registration:<br\/><blockquote>\"The examiner of titles of this judicial district, after going over the papers in the case of the city, represented by its attorney, Modesto Reyes, states that:<br\/><br\/>\"1. The application filed by the city of Manila is not accompanied by any document relative to its alleged ownership, but sets forth that said city, as the successor in rights and interest of the former<i> ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i>, is the owner of the land described in the petition above referred to.<br\/><br\/>\"2. In the office of the register of deeds there is no record of any act or contract opposing the claim of the applicant; nor does there appear, from the investigations held, any fact contrary to those quoted in the application. The present limits of the land fn question may be held as correct.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The city of Manila, in order to acquire title to the land above mentioned, must show the ownership which the former <i>ayuntdmiento<\/i> had over said land.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\"OPINION.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"Based on the above report, the undersigned is of the opinion that the title of the city of Manila, represented by its attorney, Modesto Reyes, is defective and can not be registered.<br\/><br\/>\"Manila, December 7, 1904.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"AGUEDO VELARDE.\"<\/div><\/blockquote>On the 14th of March, 1905, the cause was duly brought on for trial and during the trial of said cause the petitioner attempted to establish by proof the following facts: First. That said land formerly belonged to the old city of Manila (<i>ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i>) under the sovereignty of Spain.<br\/><br\/>Second. That the present city of Manila is at present the owner of said land by virtue of being the successor of the old city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>Third. That the old city of Manila from the year 1894 until the change of sovereignty in the Philippine Archipelago had rented said land, had received rents therefor, and in a general way had administered the same.<br\/><br\/>The respondent, the Central Government of the Philippine Islands, presented no proof whatever in opposition to the claim of the petitioner relying upon the fact that the petitioner was not entitled to have said land registered, for the following reasons:<br\/><br\/>First. That the land in question was public land, belonging to the Central Government; that the same had never been granted to any person or corporation or municipality by the Spanish Government.<br\/><br\/>Second, That the city of Manila, neither the present nor the old city, was the owner of said land.<br\/><br\/>On the 15th day of February, 1906, the judge of the said court filed his decision by which he denied the registration of the land claimed by the said Geronimo Morales and granted the registration of the rest of said described property in favor of the said city. Against this order allowing the registration of said tract of land the respondent duly excepted and gave notice of his intention to appeal.<br\/><br\/>The Attorney-General, representing the respondent in this court, made the following assignment of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"There is nothing in the record which justifies the conclusion of the judgment of the court below, to the effect that the land in question is owned by the city of Manila.\"<\/blockquote>The only proof presented during the trial by the petitioner which tended in any way to support its claim was thait in the year 1894 and thereafter the old city of Manila (<i>ayuntamienta de Manila<\/i>) rented said land and received the rent therefor, and that the present city of Manila succeeded to the rights of said old city. No proof was offered by the plaintiff, documentary or other, to show in any way by what right said old city exercised this right of control over said property.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion, and so hold, that the mere renting of property and receiving the rent therefor can not, of themselves, in the absence of other proof, support a claim of ownership of such property.<br\/><br\/>It has been argued that every pueblo organized by the Spanish Government in its insular possessions has had granted to it, as a matter of course, certain lands for public purposes, puch as public commons, pasture lands, etc. Our attention has not been called to any law or royal decree in which this contention is supported and we have searched in vain to find such a provision.\u00a0 Upon the contrary we have found a royal decree of the ________ day of ________ showing that the people of the pueblo of Dilao (now the barrio of Paco in which this very land is located) had petitioned for a grant of a<i> comunal<\/i>, etc., and which was denied.<br\/><br\/>One of the earliest provisions of law relating to the rights of pueblos in the insular possessions of the Spanish Government is that <i>de las reducciones, y pueblos de indios<\/i> (settlements and pueblos of natives) of December 1, 1573, as amended by that of the 10th of October, 1618, found in Law VIII, Title III of Book VI of the <i>Recopilacion de las Leyes de Indias,<\/i> and which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The sites whereon the pueblos and settlements are to be built must have water facilities, lands, forests, entrances and exits, lands for cultivation, and an <i>exoido<\/i> (common, public land) one league long, wherein the natives may keep their cattle, without mingling them with those owned by Spaniards.\"<\/blockquote>This provision of law seems to have been amplified in article 53 of the Ordinances of Good Government, dated February 26, 1768, and extended to the pueblos of the Philippine Islands by proclamation on the 11th day of September, 1801. This article 53 clearly indicates that these lands should be designated by the Spanish Government for the use and benefit<i> de las reducciones, y pueblos de los indios<\/i>.\u00a0 Said article 53 is in part as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is held to be <i>comunal<\/i> (common, public) the territory of the settlements and pueblos inhabited by natives, to which, from the time of their foundation or organization, the necessary lands were allotted in conformity with Law VII, Title III, Book VI of the <i>Recopilacion de las Leyes de Indias<\/i>, etc.\"<\/blockquote>This article 53 clearly indicates the following:<br\/><br\/>First. That the King continued to be the absolute owner of said lands;<br\/><br\/>Second. That the pueblos were only given the .mere usufruct of the same;<br\/><br\/>Third. That the King might at any time annul such grant; and<br\/><br\/>Fourth. That a designation, of the particular land so granted, was a necessary prerequisite for the holding of the same for the purposes indicated, by the said pueblo. (See <i>Autos Acordados,<\/i> Vol. I, pp. 29, 48.)<br\/><br\/>As a further \"confirmation, of the fact that the pueblos of the Philippine Islands did not have, as a matter of right, a <i>comunal<\/i>, etc., unless the same had been expressly granted, we find the following provision in the royal decree of February 28, 1883, which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"On the recommendation of the minister for the colonies, and in conformity with the opinion submitted by the council of state, sitting in bane, I hereby decree the following :<br\/><br\/>\"ARTICLE 1. The <i>legua comunal<\/i> for the Philippine Islands, under the provisions of Law VIII, Title III, Book VI, of the <i>Recopilacion de Indias<\/i>, as far as the pueblos already established and those which may be established thereafter are concerned, shall be of an area of 20,000 feet, equivalent to a league of 20 degrees, without regard to the geometrical figure resulting from the topography of the locality, or to conditions relating to property rights over the land itself or over land adjoining the same.<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 2. The pueblos not having said land allotted to them may apply and obtain the same by means of the corresponding proceedings.<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 3. When the conditions so require, the pueblos may institute proceedings to obtain an extension of said comunal land, in order that the latter.may be in keeping with the number of inhabitants, the number of heads of cattle owned by them, and the topographical conditions of each pueblo.\u00a0 Given, at the palace, on February 28, 1883.\"<\/blockquote>Following this royal decree we have the <i>superior decreto <\/i>of the 1st of August, 1883, relating to the <i>legua comunal<\/i>, with the following provisions:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Legua comunal<\/i>.\u2014In order to comply with and carry out the provisions of the royal decree of February 28 of the current year, published in the <i>Gaceta de Manila<\/i> on June 28 last, and relating to the <i>legua comunal<\/i>, on the recommendation of the <i>direccion general de administration civil<\/i>, I hereby order that the following regulations be observed:<br\/><br\/>\"1. The provincial chiefs shall take special care to inform the <i>gobernadorcillos<\/i> of the towns under their control of the decree relating to the <i>legua comunal<\/i>, making them understand that the superficial extension to be occupied by the same is that corresponding to a square, the sides of which measure 20,000 feet, equivalent to a square league, (<i>de veinte al grado<\/i>), and that the land should be uncultivated or untilled.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The towns not having said portion of land assigned may apply for the same to this central government through the chief of the province or district, inclosing with the petition a report of the principalia, stating the said circumstance and as many particulars as may exist in their archives regarding the matter.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The said documents shall be forwarded to the <i>direction general de administracivn civil,<\/i> through the provincial chief, and the said office, upon the information from the bureau of forestry, shall recommend to me what it may deem proper.<br\/><br\/>\"4.<i> After the 'legua comunal' has been granted by this Government<\/i>, the bureau of forestry shall proceed to the setting up of the boundary marks of the same, executing a certificate of the land, which, after being signed by the officer conducting the proceedings and by the <i>principalia<\/i> of the town, will be submitted for my approval through the <i>direccion general de administration civil.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"5. For the <i>legua comunal<\/i> uncultivated land will be selected, whenever possible, which may be in proper condition for the pasture of cattle and cultivation of building timber and the necessary industries to meet the requirements of the inhabitants.<br\/><br\/>\"6. In order to increase the said communal land, when the requirements of the towns may demand, it will be necessary to institute new proceedings, which will be annexed to a statement signed by the <i>principalia<\/i>, showing the number of the inhabitants of the town, the kind and number of head of cattle owned by them, as well as an indication of the extension of the lands which, bearing in mind the local conditions, they may deem necessary to meet the requirements of the former and nourishment for the latter.<br\/><br\/>\"7. These statements will be forwarded to the <i>direccion general<\/i> by the chief of the province, together with his opinion, in which he will state whether, or not he considers the petition to be unreasonable.<br\/><br\/>\"8. The offices under the department of finance will furnish the <i>direction general de administration<\/i> with the necessary documents for verifying the truth of the declarations made by the <i>principalias<\/i> of the towns, regarding the number of the inhabitants and. heads of cattle.<br\/><br\/>\"9. The <i>direccion general de administration civil,<\/i> with the report of the bureau of forestry and, should it be deemed necessary, of the board of agriculture, shall recommend to me the extension to be finally marked for the <i>legua comunal<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"10. After the area of the land has been determined by this general government, the bureau of forestry shall proceed with the appointment and the setting of marks of the new communal land, a certificate being executed in the same form as previously stated.<br\/><br\/>\"11. The expenses arising from the proceedings, as well as those arising from the setting up of boundary marks of the <i>legua comunal<\/i> and its final establishment, must be paid by the town to which the concession has been granted.\" (Gazette No. 42, August 11.)<\/blockquote>By the royal decree of the 23d of December, 1870, it was made necessary by monuments or otherwise to mark the division lines of the different pueblos of the Philippine Islands,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (<i>Gaceta de Madrid<\/i>, February 24.)<br\/><br\/>By the royal order of the 17th of January, 1885, it was provided that, when a pueblo should show to the Government of the Philippine Islands that its <i>legua comunal<\/i> was insufficient, it might, upon petition, have such lines increased.\u00a0 (<i>Gaceta de Madrid<\/i>, March 15, 1885.)<br\/><br\/>The royal decree of the 19th of May, 1893, relating to the municipal government (<i>Gaceta de Madrid<\/i>, May 22 1893) contains no provisions with reference to the granting to pueblos of the<i> legua comunal<\/i>, etc.<br\/><br\/>The question of the right of pueblos in the insular possessions of the Spanish Government to public lands has come before the Supreme Court of the United States several times in its relation to pueblos in the territory acquired by the United States from the King of Spain.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Grisar <i>vs.<\/i> McDowell (6 Wallace, 363, 373) Justice Field in discussing this question said:<br\/><blockquote>\"These laws provided for the assignment to the pueblos, for their use and the use of their inhabitants, of land not exceeding in extent 4 square leagues. Such assignment was to be made by the public authorities of the Government upon the original establishment of the pueblo, or afterwards upon the petition of its officers or inhabitants; and the land was to be measured off in a square or prolonged form, according to the nature and condition of the country. All lands within the general limits stated, which had prevously become private property or were required for public purposes, were reserved and excepted from the assignment.<br\/><br\/>\"Until the lands were thus definitely assigned and measured oft\", the right or claim of the pueblo was an imperfect one. It was a right which the Government might refuse to recognize at all, or might recognize in a qualified form; it might be burdened with conditions, and it might be restricted to less limits than the 4 square leagues, which was the usual quantity assigned.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of United States <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> Santa Fe (165 U. S., 707), in which this same question was involved, Justice White of the Supreme Court of the United States said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It can not be doubted that under the law of Spain it was necessary that the proper authorities should particularly designate the land to be acquired by towns or pueblos before a vested right or title to the use thereof could arise.\"<\/blockquote>Elizondo, in his work entitled <i>Pratica Universal Forence<\/i> (vol. 5, p. 220), makes the following statement relating to the question presented here:<br\/><blockquote>\"There is nothing whatever designated by law as belonging to towns, other than that which by royal privilege, custom, or contract between man and man is granted to them, so that although there be assigned to tire towns at the time of their constitution <i>territorio <\/i>or <i>pertinencias<\/i>, which may be common to all the residents, without each one having the right to use them separately, it is a prerogative reserved to the sovereigns to divide the <i>terminos<\/i> of the provinces and towns, assigning to these the use and enjoyment, but the domain remaining in the sovereigns themseves.\"<\/blockquote>Chief Justice Fuller, speaking for the court in the case of Ignited States <i>vs.<\/i> Sandoval and in the case of Morton <i>vs.<\/i> United States (167 U. S., 278, 297), said:<br\/><blockquote>'Under the laws of the Indies, lands not actually to settlers remained the property of the King, to be disposed of by him or by those on whom he might confer that power. As Mr. Hall says (Chap. VII, \u00a7 122): 'The fee of the lands embraced within the limits of pueblos continued to remain in the sovereign, and never in the pueblo as a corporate body.' \"<\/blockquote>The petitioner herein not having presented proof showing that the land in question had been granted to it by the former sovereign in these Islands, and not having shown that it was entitled to said lands by virtue of some law of the present sovereign of these Islands, the Court of Land Registration was not empowered to grant the registration of said lands in favor of said petitioner. The judgment, therefore, of the lower court is hereby reversed. So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Carson, Willard,<\/i> and <i>Tracey, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/> <sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> Cases Nos 3299 and 3300, both entitled The City of Manila <i>vs.<\/i> The Insular Government, and involving the same points, were also considered at the same time, and the judgments of the Court of Land Registration, refusing to register in, favor of the city of Manila the property involved, were affirmed for reasons similar to those set forth in the present opinion. <\/div>",

The evidence does not show, as claimed by the appellant, that there were two levies.\u00a0\u00a0 Only one levy was made and that was made on\u00a0 the 13th day\u00a0 of\u00a0 January, when Sammons, the plaintiff,\u00a0 was present.\u00a0\u00a0 That Sammons was sole owner of the property on that date is fully established by the proof.<br\/><br\/>But the appellant claims that the plaintiff presented\u00a0 to the sheriff no written claim of ownership, as required by section 442 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 The evidence upon\u00a0 this point is strongly in favor of the finding of the court below.\u00a0 The plaintiff testified that while in Manila he was\u00a0 notified that the property was being taken from the store; that he thereupon employed a lawyer in Manila and caused to-be made, and he himself swore to, an affidavit of ownership of the property and that he delivered this affidavit to his lawyer.\u00a0 The lawyer swore that\u00a0 he went to Bautista and delivered the affidavit to the deputy sheriff, retaining a copy himself, which he produced at the trial. The deputy sheriff admitted that the lawyer came to see him and gave him the contract of November 25.\u00a0 When asked if the lawyer gave him\u00a0 also an affidavit of ownership, he at\u00a0 first stated\u00a0 that he could not remember.\u00a0 He afterwards denied\u00a0 that any such affidavit was given\u00a0 to him. Upon\u00a0 this evidence, the finding of the court below against the appellant can not be reversed.\u00a0 The case is in many respects stronger for the\u00a0 plaintiff than the similar case of Uy Piaoco <i>vs.<\/i> Osme\u00f1a, No. 3935, decided December 4,1907.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup><br\/><br\/>The judgment of\u00a0 the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.\u00a0 J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson,\u00a0 Carson,,<\/i>\u00a0 and<i> Tracey,\u00a0 JJ., <\/i>concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> Page 299, <i>supra.<\/i><\/div>",

THE ESTATE OF TELESFOKO CHUIDIAN ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS. <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the 6th of November, 1903, Tomas Sunico, executor under the will of Telesforo Chuidian, deceased, filed a complaint against Francisco\u00a0 Chuidian, in an action bearing the register number 2231, in which he alleged that the said Francisco Chuidian\u00a0 in the years 1902 and 1903\u00a0 received of the said Telesforo Chuidian various sums amounting to 8,040.78 pesos,\u00a0 Mexican currency, which the said Francisco Chuidian obligated himself to pay with interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum; that the said money was due and payable,\u00a0 and that the accumulated interest thereon up to the time of the filing of\u00a0 the\u00a0 complaint amounted to 1,195.25 pesos, Mexican currency.<br\/><br\/>Francisco Chuidian filed a general denial, and at the same time prayed that this action be united (<i>acumulado<\/i>) with a pending action bearing register number 2759, wherein Francisco Chuidian\u00a0 was plaintiff, and <i>la testamentariade Telesforo Chuidian<\/i>, deceased, Tomas\u00a0 Sunico, administrator, and <i>la sociedad Chuidian, Buenaventura y Chi.<\/i>, and Enrique de Mercaida, liquidator, defendants; that the prayer of the complaint in this action bearing register number 2759 be treated as a counterclaim in the action bearing register number 2231; and that the appropriate judgment be rendered.<br\/><br\/>In that complaint it was alleged:<br\/><br\/>That on the 29th of December, 1882, Telesforo Chuidian, Candelaria Chuidian, llaymunda Chuidian, and Mariano Huenaventura executed an instrument in writing wherein they agreed to carry on the partnership <i>(compa\u00f1ia regular colectiva)<\/i> theretofore conducted under the firm name of Chuidian, Buenaventura y Compa\u00f1ia; that the\u00a0 capital of the said company was fixed at 160,00 pesos, Mexican currency, of which\u00a0 the three partners\u00a0 first above mentioned were to pay 150,000 pesos and the last mentioned 10,000 pesos; that aside from their interest in the capital of the said partnership, each of the said partners had a current account with the society, which was\u00a0 treated as an interestbearing credit against the same, there being due to Telesforo Chuidian 277,595.04\u00a0 pesos,\u00a0 Mexican currency;\u00a0 to Candelaria Chuidian, 186,551.25 2\/8 pesos, Mexican currency; to Raymunda Chuidian, 106,894.412 2\/8 pesos, Mexican currency; to Mariano Bunaventura, 96,588.10 5\/8 pesos, Mexican currency;<br\/><br\/>That besides these credits in favor of\u00a0 the individual partners, the said partnership was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of 24,630.22 pesos, Mexican currency, bearing interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum; and that in the said articles of partnership the partners had agreed that\u00a0 the credits of the plaintiff and of Jose Chuidian should be preferred to the credits of the different partners in the settlement of the partnership accounts;<br\/><br\/>That on the 31st of December, 1896, the account of the plaintiff with the society was balanced, showing a balance in favor of the plaintiff amounting to 20,116.00 3\/8 pesos, Mexican currency;<br\/><br\/>That notwithstanding the preference secured to the credit of the plaintiff, the partners had withdrawn from their respective accounts-current considerable sums in excess of that authorized by the articles of partnership, for the purpose of paying their individual credits;<br\/><br\/>That early in the year 1902 Telesforo Chuidian died in the city of Manila, and that his estate is in administration in the hands of the defendant Tomas Sunico;<br\/><br\/>That since the date of the reorganization of the said society it had suffered heavy losses, which, united to the withdrawal of almost the entire individual credits due the partners, left the said society in a state of complete insolvency, and this notwithstanding\u00a0 that the capital of 160,000 pesos, Mexican currency, appears to be intact;<br\/><br\/>That the plaintiff has fruitlessly demanded payment of the said partnership; and that\u00a0 he presented his claim in due time\u00a0 to the\u00a0 commission appointed to\u00a0 hear claims against the estate of the said Telesforo Chuidian, deceased; that the claim had been rejected by the said commission; and that the plaintiff had appealed in due time from this ruling of the commission.<br\/><br\/>That the precise amount due at the date of the demand amounted to 32,053.73 pesos, Mexican currency.<br\/><br\/>The defendant partnership, replying to\u00a0 this complaint, set up in special defense the contention that the right of the plaintiff to recover the debt due him\u00a0 was postponed to the right of the outside creditors to be paid the debts due them\u00a0 amounting to 17,431.06 2\/8 pesos, Mexican\u00a0 currency; that on the 25th of April, 1901,\u00a0 at the request of the plaintiff, the sum of 14,000\u00a0 pesos, Mexican currency, which appeared in his current account, was\u00a0 transferred to Jose Chuidian; and that on the 20th of June, 1904, the date when the complaint was\u00a0 filed, the current account of the plaintiff amounted only to 14,619.74 3\/8 pesos, Mexican currency.<br\/><br\/>The executor of the estate of Telesforo Chuidian, in his separate answer, alleged that the\u00a0 responsibility\u00a0 of the partners in the said partnership was limited to their share in the capital therein, because clause 19 of the articles of partnership prescribes that upon the dissolution\u00a0 of the partnership, outside creditors other than the said Francisco\u00a0 Chuidian and his brother Jose Chuidian should first be paid; that the indebtedness to outside creditors amounted to 17,431.06 2\/8 pesos,\u00a0 Mexican currency; that the said partnership\u00a0 was in course of liquidation not yet terminated, and\u00a0 that, as a consequence thereof, the responsibility of the various partners could not as\u00a0 yet\u00a0 be fixed;\u00a0 that the said partnership never had been declared insolvent; and that, on the contrary, the said society had goods, real estate, and credits, to the value of 585,256.56 7\/8 pesos,\u00a0 Mexican currency, upon which execution had never been levied.<br\/><br\/>On the\u00a0 12th day of December, 1904, the trial court without objection directed that the\u00a0 said\u00a0 actions be\u00a0 united <i>(acumulados)<\/i>, and on the 3d day of November, 1906, rendered judgment as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Let judgment be entered in favor of Tomas Sunico as administrator of the estate of Telesforo Chuidian, deceased, plaintiff in case No. 2231, and\u00a0 against the defendant Francisco Chuidian, for the sum of $9,236.03, Mexican currency, equivalent to 9,236.03, Philippine currency, with interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent per annum since March 23, 1904, and the costs of the action.<br\/><br\/>\"Execution will not issue hereon until the partnership of Chuidian, Buenaventura &amp; Co.\u00a0 has been liquidated, and the defendant's claim as hereinbefore found satisfied, and in case it is not satisfied any balance appearing unsatisfied may\u00a0 be offset against this judgment, and for judgment dismissing the said Francisco Chuidian's claim against said estate, subject to the foregoing findings.<br\/><br\/>\"And let judgment be etnered in favor of Francisco Chuidian\u00a0 against Enrique de Marcaida, as liquidator of the partnership of Chuidian, Buenaventura &amp; Co., for the sum of 13,413.58, Mexican currency,\u00a0 equivalent to the sum of 13,413.58, Philippine currency, with interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent per annum since April 5,\u00a0 1901, and the costs of the action.\"<\/blockquote>From this judgment the\u00a0 plaintiff Tomas Sunico,\u00a0 executor of the estate of Telesforo\u00a0 Chuidian appealed, and filed his assignments of error as follows:<br\/><br\/>First, the trial court erred in holding in its decision that the sum of 9,230 pesos, Mexican currency, with interest at the rate of 8 per cent from the 23d of March, 1904, until paid, which was adjudged in favor of the estate of the said Telesforo Chuidian, should\u00a0 not be executed until the day Francisco Chuidian should have been paid the amount indebted to him;<br\/><br\/>Second, the trial court erred in holding that the said Francisco Chuidian was entitled to recover the sum of 13,413.58 pesos, Mexican currency, with interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum from the 5th of April, 1901;<br\/><br\/>Third, the trial court erred in holding that the members of the partnership Chuidian, Buenaventura y Cia.\u00a0 were jointly and severally responsible for the said debt.<br\/><br\/>In support of the first assignment of error, it\u00a0 is contended that the trial court erred in permitting the separate actions of Tomas Sunico, executor of the estate of Telesforo Chuidian, <i>vs.<\/i> Francisco Chuidian, and of Francisco Chuidian <i>vs.<\/i> The Estate of Telesforo Chuidian et ah, to be united (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">acumulados<\/span>), and in treating the complaint in the latter action as an answer setting up a counterclaim in the former action.\u00a0 It is sufficient answer to this contention to say that no objection was made on\u00a0 this ground in the court below, and appellant can not be heard to urge it for the first time on appeal.<br\/><br\/>In support of the first assignment of error as well as of the third, it is said that the appellee was not entitled to judgment against the appellant, an individual member of the partnership, in the same action in which judgment was rendered against the partnership itself, because under the provisions of article 237 of the Code of Commerce execution will not issue on the individual property of partners (of a<i> compa\u00f1ia colectiva<\/i>) until the partnership property has been exhausted.<br\/><br\/>But article 127 of the Code of Commerce provides that\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"All the members of the general copartnership, be they or\u00a0 be they not managing partners of the same, are personally and jointly liable with all their property for the results of the transactions made in the name and for the account of the partnership,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>And article 1144 of\u00a0 the Civil Code provides that\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"A creditor may sue any of the joint debtors or all of them simultaneously\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>These provisions clearly establish the right of a creditor of the partnership (<i>compa\u00f1ia colectiva<\/i>) to bring his action against the individual\u00a0 partners and the partnership at the same time; and this right is not taken away by the provisions of article 237 of\u00a0 the Code of Commerce, because the rights secured therein can be and should be recognized and protected in the judgment.\u00a0 (La Compania Maritima <i>vs.<\/i> Munoz.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>)\u00a0 In the\u00a0 case at bar the provision for the suspension of execution on appellant's judgment, and its satisfaction from\u00a0 the amount which the appellee's participation in the proceeds of the liquidation of the partnership assets shall be found to fall short of the total amount for which judgment is allowed him against the partnership, seem to afford an eminently practical recognition and mode of preservation of the rights of both parties, and should not\u00a0 be disturbed.<br\/><br\/>It is contended,\u00a0 however, that the above-cited provisions of the Code of Commerce and the Civil Code are not applicable in this\u00a0 case because, as\u00a0 it is alleged, the partnership in question was not a <i>compa\u00f1ia colectiva<\/i>, and clause 19 of the articles of partnership expressly limits the responsibility of the partners to the amount of the capital invested in the partnership.\u00a0 Appellant insists that since one of the conditions of a <i>compa\u00f1ia colectiva<\/i> is that all its members are bound (responsible) <i>personal y solidariamente<\/i> (individually and jointly) for its obligations, and since the said clause in the articles of partnership expressly provides that the partners shall not be thus responsible for its obligations,\u00a0 this partnership can not be held to be a <i>compa\u00f1ia colectiva<\/i> as defined in the Code of Commerce.\u00a0 We do not think, however, that this is a necessary consequence flowing from the insertion of this provision in the articles of partnership.\u00a0 On the contrary, we are of opinion that if it be found on examination that in all other respects the partnership is a <i>compa\u00f1ia colectiva<\/i> as defined by the\u00a0 Code of Commerce, this clause of the articles of partnership must be held to be absolutely null and void, so far as\u00a0 it affects third persons, being in manifest conflict with the provisions of the said article 127 of the code.\u00a0 Article 117 of the Code of Commerce expressly provides that whatever be the form in which the articles of partnership are executed, if they comply with the legal requisites, the lawful and honest conditions thereof shall be valid and obligatory, but only in so far as they are not expressly prohibited in that code. Clearly, a condition which attempts to relieve the partners of a responsibility expressly imposed by law for the protection and security of third persons dealing with the partnership is prohibited, and is therefore invalid and of no effect so far as it\u00a0 affects them.<br\/><br\/>Article 116 of the Code of Commerce defines mercantile partnership as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Articles\u00a0 of association by which two or more persons obligate themselves to place in a common fund any property, industry, or any of\u00a0 these things, in order to obtain profit, shall be commercial, no matter what the class may be, provided the association has\u00a0 been\u00a0 established in accordance with the provisions of this code.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\"<\/div><\/blockquote>Article 125 of the Code of Commerce is as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The articles of general copartnership must state :<br\/><br\/>\"The names, surnames, and domiciles of the partners.<br\/><br\/>\"The firm name.<br\/><br\/>\"The names and surnames of the partners to whom the management of the firm and the use of its signature\u00a0 is intrusted.<br\/><br\/>\"The capital which each partner contributes in cash, credits, or property, stating the value given the latter or the basis on which their appraisement is to be made.<br\/><br\/>\"The duration of the copartnership.<br\/><br\/>\"The amounts which, in a proper case, are to be given to each managing partner annually for his private expenses.<br\/><br\/>\"There\u00a0 may be also included in the articles the other legal agreements and special conditions which the partners may wish to make.\"<\/blockquote>Article 122 of the Code of Commerce classifies mercantile partnerships as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"As a general rule\u00a0 commercial associations shall be established by the\u00a0\n adoption of any of the following forms:<br\/><br\/>\"1. The regular general copartnership in which all the partners, under a collective and commercial\u00a0 name, bind themselves to participate, in the proportion which may be established, in the same rights and obligations.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The limited copartnership to which one or more persons contribute a specific amount of capital to a\u00a0 common fund, in order to be liable for the social transactions executed exclusively by\u00a0 others under a collective name.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The corporation, in which the members form the common fund by means of specific parts or portions, represented by\u00a0 shares or in any other unquestionable manner leaving its management to removable managers or administrators, who represent the company under an appropriate denomination according to the\u00a0 purpose or undertaking the funds are destined to.\"<\/blockquote>The partnership in\u00a0 question was undoubtedly a mercantile partnership\u00a0 as defined in article 116; the articles of partnership\u00a0 strictly comply with all the requirements prescribed in article 125; and the partnership manifestly does not fall under the head of <i>compa\u00f1ias comanditarias<\/i> or <i>compa\u00f1ias anonimas<\/i> as set out in article 122, while it does clearly come under the definition of a <i>compania regular colectira<\/i>, as set out therein.\u00a0 There can be no doubt therefore that the partnership in question is a <i> compa\u00f1ia colectiva <\/i> as defined in the mercantile code, and that clause 5, in so far at least as it affects third persons, is invalid and of no effect.<br\/><br\/>The second assignment of error is based on two grounds:<br\/><br\/>First, that under one of the clauses of the articles of partnership it was agreed that payment of the amount due the plaintiff should not be made until certain other debts had been paid, and that these debts have not yet been paid. This article is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Upon the dissolution of the company the corporate capital\u00a0 shall be distributed as follows: After payment of outstanding obligations in favor of persons foreign to the society, the capital\u00a0 falling to the share of the minors Jose de Marcaida y Chuidian and Francisco\u00a0 Chuidian will be deducted together with interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum, the latter to be credited in current account.\"<\/blockquote>It does not appear, however, that the plaintiff was a member of said partnership, or that he ever agreed to this clause of the articles of partnership.\u00a0 On the contrary, it expressly appears from an examination of the said articles that lie took no part therein, that he was not a partner, and that the debt due him stands on the same footing as any other indebtedness of the company, except that it is expressly recognized in the said articles.\u00a0 Under the circumstances the plaintiff is\u00a0 not and can not be bound by\u00a0 the provisions of the articles of partnership relied upon by the appellants nor can they have the effect of postponing his right of recovery, as contended by the appellant.<br\/><br\/>The second ground upon which this assignment\u00a0 of error is based is\u00a0 an alleged error in the calculation of principal and interest of the debt due the plaintiff.\u00a0 On examination of the judgment we find no error to\u00a0 the prejudice of the appellant in the statement of\u00a0 the account by the trial judge, though it is true that by\u00a0 mistake a certain\u00a0 item of the account is treated as of the 5th of April when it should have been\u00a0 entered\u00a0 as of the 25th of April.\u00a0 This error, however, in no wise prejudices the rights of the appellant, nor does it necessitate\u00a0 the modification of the judgment rendered in the court below.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the trial court should be, and is hereby, affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Neither does an examination of the original record show that said exception had ever been taken therein.<br\/><br\/>This case is identical with that of Rubert &amp; Guamis <i>vs.<\/i> Luengo &amp; Martinez et al.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> (5 Off. Gaz., 663). In that case it was also said, in the statement of proceedings at the commencement of the bill of exceptions, that an exception had been taken to the overruling of the motion for a new trial, when in reality the fact was just to the contrary. We then decided that the evidence could not be reviewed on account of the absence of said exception, and the same doctrine is herein applied. This is a fundamental question in an action, inasmuch as it directly affects the jurisdiction of this court in reviewing the questions of fact. Without the taking of an exception, our jurisdiction in this matter is limited simply to the questions of law which may arise from the conclusions contained in the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>The court below has set down as a conclusion of fact \"that Joaquin Tugad (of whose intestate estate the plaintiff is the administrator) was in peaceful possession of the land described in the complaint, and that in the year 1896 he was illegally, violently, and by means of threats deprived of the land by the defendant, Calixta Mabborang, and that the said Calixta Mabborang is now illegally in possession of said land.\"<br\/><br\/>This premise being established, the unavoidable consequence in law is, that the defendant must make restitution to the plaintiff of the land, of the possession of which she violently deprived Juan Tugad; it was so decided and justly ordered in the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>The appellant points out as an error the admission of Exhibit A of the plaintiff. This document was presented in order to prove that an action was brought years ago in connection with the same land now sued for, before the proper court of the justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>Whether the said exhibit should or should not have been admitted, the truth is that its contents can not materially affect the decision in the matter. The conclusion above transcribed, derived from the testimony of several witnesses, as deduced from the judgment itself, is sufficient to fully justify the decision herein contained. Therefore, the error that may have been committed, assuming that any actually exists, can not in any case cause the repeal of the judgment appealed from, for the reason that it does not affect the essential rights of the appellant.

the new complaint being filed by a new plaintiff and all the defendants having been excluded except one, and the amount prayed for not being within the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace.\u00a0 Having in mind the proceedings had in the clerk's office and the nature of the case, this must be considered\u00a0 as an appeal, and\u00a0 not\u00a0 an\u00a0 original action, and judgment must be rendered upon the basis of the original complaint; that is to say, the complaint in the action of Francisco Rosco against Mariano Bebueno\u00a0 et al.; but no judgment can be rendered against the defendants\u00a0 who were excluded from\u00a0 the new or the amended complaint. The plaintiff had a right to exclude the other defendants when he reproduced his complaint, and this court has no jurisdiction in this case other than its appellate jurisdiction.\"<\/blockquote>Judgment was entered against the defendant, Mariano Bebueno, for the sum of P300 and costs, on the 23d day of January, 1907, and by an order dated March 19, 1907, the, court reserved to the plaintiffs the right to proceed with an appropriate action in the appealed case of Ignacio Rosco <i>vs.<\/i> Mariano Bebueno et al.<br\/><br\/>From this judgment the defendant appealed, and brought the case here\u00a0 upon his bill of exceptions, and upon this appeal, the defendant insists that the court erred in rendering judgment against the defendant and in favor of the plaintiff,<br\/><br\/>We think that the contention of appellant must be\u00a0 sustained.\u00a0 Whatever may have been the intention of counsel for the plaintiffs, it is clear that the complaint filed in this action can in no wise be regarded as a reproduction of the complaint in the action of Francisco Rosco <i>vs.<\/i> Mariano Rebueno, appealed from the court of the justice of the peace.\u00a0 Indeed it is quite clear, as contended in the trial court by counsel for the plaintiffs, that it was his intention to file a new complaint, wholly disregarding the proceedings had in the court of the justice of the peace.\u00a0\u00a0 In this complaint, he unites the plaintiffs in the two separate actions in the court of the justice of the peace, and he prays for larger damages for the sale of the animals mentioned in both complaints in the court of the justice of the peace, than the sum total of the damages prayed \"for in both\u00a0 complaints in that court, and he brings bis action against only one of the several defendants in both of the actions in the court below.\u00a0 This he had a perfect right to do,\u00a0 and he was entitled, as was the defendant entitled, to a judgment in conformity with the material issues\u00a0 raised by the pleadings.\u00a0 What\u00a0 would have been the result, had a plea of <i>res adjudicata<\/i> been filed\u00a0 by the defendant, it is not necessary for us to consider at this time.<br\/><br\/>It is true that the plaintiffs did not appeal from the judgment of the Court\u00a0 of\u00a0 First Instance, but we think that the defendant was clearly entitled to a final adjudication of all the material issues raised by the pleadings, and that the trial court was not justified in limiting; itself to a determination of only so much of the complaint filed in this case as was in accord with the allegations of the complaint in one of the cases, apparently selected arbitrarily, which had come up on appeal from the trial court. There\u00a0 can be no\u00a0 doubt that the complaint filed in the Court of First Instance could in no sense be regarded as a reproduction of the separate complaints filed in separate actions in the court of the justice of the peace, which were appealed to that court, nor could it be considered as a reproduction of the complaint in either of them, since it alleges and prays for damages in an amount over which the court of the justice of the peace had no jurisdiction. (Alonso <i>vs.<\/i> Municipality of Placer, 5 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 71.) The judgment\u00a0 appealed from should be and is hereby reversed, without special condemnation of costs, and the record will be remanded to the trial court for a new trial.

All this in violation of the law.\"<\/blockquote>The trial court found that at\u00a0 about a quarter past 5 o'clock on the evening of the 27th of August, 1907,\u00a0 in the town of Olongapo, a fight took place between some Chinamen on the one hand and Filipinos\u00a0 on the other, in\u00a0 which fight a Chinaman called Ching-Ching received a fatal dagger wound which resulted in his death in less than fifteen minutes.\u00a0 That the accused Alfredo Reyes and Fortunato de la Cruz took an active part in the fight.\u00a0 That during the fight, De la Cruz, a strong, active man, seized hold of a Chinaman named Ching-Ching from behind, holding his arms tightly by his side, while Reyes inflicted\u00a0 two mortal wounds upon the Chinaman, with a knife or dagger, as a result of which he died in less than fifteen minutes.<br\/><br\/>We think the evidence of record fully sustains the findings of the trial court.\u00a0 Both the accused denied all knowledge of or participation in the death\u00a0 of the Chinaman Ching-Ching, Reyes setting up an alibi, and De la\u00a0 Cruz, while admitting that he was present when the dispute arose insisting that he was not there for more than three minutes, and that if the Chinaman\u00a0 was killed during the fight, he knew nothing whatever about it.\u00a0 These statements of the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 were wholly\u00a0 disproved by the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, the\u00a0 statements of L.\u00a0 E. Martin, Eng Ton,\u00a0 Yee He, Lim Chac, and Pablo Lindayog, leaving no room\u00a0 for doubt as to the participation\u00a0 of these accused in the fight in the course\u00a0 of which the Chinaman met\u00a0 his death.\u00a0 The testimony\u00a0 of Eng Ton and Yee He, who were eyewitnesses of the killing of the Chinaman, clearly\u00a0 establishes the guilt of the accused of the taking of his life, in the manner and form above set out, and as found by the trial\u00a0 court.\u00a0 Counsel for the appellants insists that the testimony of these witnesses should not be, accepted without reserve, because the parties to the fight were respectively Chinamen and Filipinos, and the statements of the Chinese witnesses\u00a0 may have been colored by race prejudice and animosity.\u00a0 We do not think that the fear that the witnesses may have been prejudiced is sufficient to cast a reasonable doubt upon the truth of their statements, which in all details, except only as to the actual killing of the deceased, were corroborated by the testimony of wholly reliable and impartial\u00a0 witnesses.\u00a0\u00a0 Their testimony is consistent, positive, and definite, and carries with it a conviction of its truth and accuracy.\u00a0 The only\u00a0 important evidence in apparent conflict with\u00a0 their\u00a0 statements,\u00a0 was that of Robert M. Saunders, a bar keeper, who stated that\u00a0 he\u00a0 had been an eyewitness of the fight, and that, he observed the conduct of Fortunato\u00a0 de\u00a0 la Cruz throughout,\u00a0 and that the only. part which\u00a0 this accused took in the fight was to throw sand at the Chinaman.\u00a0 We do\u00a0 not think, however,\u00a0 that the testimony of\u00a0 this witness puts in doubt\u00a0 the truth of the statements of the witnesses for the prosecution.\u00a0 He states that \"when the fight was on\u00a0 in full force, I noticed one Filipino in particular,\u00a0 called Fortunato de\u00a0 la Cruz, instead\u00a0 of getting a stick or bolo, or something to defend himself with, was throwing dirt\u00a0 at those Chinamen.\" Again he said, \"I was standing\u00a0 on the northwest\u00a0 corner of the crossing of Calle Harris and Calle Roxas, when the fight began to get interesting;\u00a0 I\u00a0 ran up to the northwest corner of Calles Harris and Roxas, and was about 15 feet from the fight.\u00a0 I noticed Fortunato de la Cruz standing near the southwest\u00a0 corner\u00a0 of,\u00a0 the\u00a0 crossing of these\u00a0 two streets,\u00a0 and I thought it very amusing that\u00a0 he would be throwing sand in the fight, instead of getting a stick or bolo to protect himself with.Approximately he did not move ten feet from the corner.\"\u00a0 It\u00a0 will be seen from these statements that this witness's attention\u00a0 was not directed to the conduct of Fortunato de la Cruz until the \"fight was on in full\u00a0 force, or as may be taken from his description of the fight, until a considerable number of participants had joined in the melee.\u00a0 The testimony of the witnesses for the\u00a0 prosecution was to the\u00a0 effect that the stabbing of the deceased took place at the very beginning of the fight, and it would appear from their evidence that the general melee between Chinamen and Filipinos was brought on by the attack of.these accused upon the man they killed.\u00a0 There is nothing, therefore, necessarily inconsistent in the statements made by the witnesses for the prosecution, and the testimony of this witness,\u00a0 even accepting as true\u00a0 his statement\u00a0 that from the\u00a0 time when he first noticed Fortunato de la Cruz until the end of the fight, De la\u00a0 Cruz did no more than\u00a0 throw sand\u00a0 at the Chinese combatants.\u00a0 An examination of the testimony of this witness leads us to\u00a0 believe\u00a0 that he was by no means impartial,\u00a0 and that he had a strong prejudice in favor of the accused, and\u00a0 was desirous\u00a0 of\u00a0 saying nothing which might tend to incriminate them.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge found the accused guilty of the crime of homicide being of opinion that the killing was not marked with aggravating or extenuating circumstances, and imposed the penalty of fourteen years eight months and one day imprisonment, with enforced labor in Bilibid Jail.\u00a0 We are of opinion, however, that the offense committed was that of assassination, as charged in the information.\u00a0 It was clearly proven,\u00a0 and so found by\u00a0 the trial judge, that one of the accused seized the Chinaman from behind and bound his hands to his side, while the other struck him with a dagger in the throat, and the evidence further discloses that this occurred before the general melee arose between the Ghinamen and Filipinos who later participated in the fight.\u00a0 Manifestly therefore, the accused employed means in the execution of the crime, which \"tended directly and especially to insure\" them \"against risk\u00a0 arising\u00a0 from the defense the injured party might otherwise have made.\"\u00a0 This circumstance marks the commission of the offense\u00a0 with\u00a0 the aggravating circumstance of treachery (<i>alevosia<\/i>), as\u00a0 defined in subdivision 2 of article 10 of the Penal Code,\u00a0 and brings the offense under the definition of the crime of assassination, as it is defined and penalized in article 403 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 We find no other aggravating or extenuating circumstances,\u00a0 and are of opinion, therefore, that the penalty prescribed should be imposed in its medium degree.<br\/><br\/>We, therefore, reverse the judgment and sentence of the trial court, and instead thereof, find the accused, Alfredo Reyes and Fortunato de la Cruz, guilty of the crime of assassination, as charged, and sentence them and each of them, to the penalty of imprisonment for life, to the payment jointly and severally of one thousand pesos (P1,000) civil indemnification to the heirs of the deceased,\u00a0 and to the payment of their respective shares of the costs in both instances.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The paragraph immediately preceding\u00a0 Rule B\u00a0 expressly refers to rule\u00a0 7.\u00a0 Rule B (<i>b<\/i>) contains an exact copy of the language of the first paragraph of rule 10, which is found following rule 7 in the same page.\u00a0 The claim\u00a0 of the importers is\u00a0 that, under rule\u00a0 7, nothing can be called a\u00a0 trimming which is not plaited.\u00a0 The theory of the collector is that anything which ornaments the garment, whether\u00a0 it is plaited or not, constitutes a trimming, and the evidence\u00a0 in this case shows that undershirts made exactly as the ones in question are,\u00a0 with the exception that the band is plain and not\u00a0 colored, are not subjected to the surtax of 30 per cent; in other words that, if the band in this case had not been red but had been of the same color as the undershirt, no\u00a0 surtax\u00a0 would have been imposed.\u00a0\u00a0 The expert from the customs testified as a witness for the Government as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. The fact is the\u00a0 distinction is made purely and simply upon the question of color.\u2014A. Yes;\u00a0 having improved the appearance of the undershirt.\"<\/blockquote>After an examination of the various provisions of the Act, we have come to the conclusion that the protest of the importers must be sustained.<br\/><br\/>The use of the phrase \"with <i>application <\/i>of trimmings,\" found both in rule 10 and in Rule B (<i>b<\/i>), indicates that the trimming is something separate and distinct from the garment and not a necessary part of it.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, the question is\u00a0 not what is the ordinary meaning of the word \"trimmings,\" but what is the meaning which the law has given to that word.\u00a0 An article completely made may be ornamented by the attachment of silk ribbons.\u00a0 In the ordinary use of the word \"trimmings,\" it may be trimmed with ribbons, but in such case it would seem that the ribbons, although they trim the garment, should not\u00a0 be classified under rule 10 as an application of trimmings, but rather under rule 6, which expressly refers to ribbons, and provides for the manner of taxing them.\u00a0 Rule 7, above quoted, in terms makes a distinction between trimmings and ribbons.<br\/><br\/>The judgment in each one of these cases is reversed and they are remanded to the\u00a0 Court of First Instance with direction to enter judgment in favor of the importers in accordance with the\u00a0 views herein expressed.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

From that sentence the defendant appealed to this court, and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><br\/>First. The Court of\u00a0 First Instance of the Province of Mindoro committed an error in declaring that the accused knowingly violated the law or that he violated it voluntarily.<br\/><br\/>Second. Said court committed an error in\u00a0 imposing a penalty not provided for by law, or, in other\u00a0 words,\u00a0 the court\u00a0 committed\u00a0 an error in imposing imprisonment\u00a0 for six months at hard labor.<br\/><br\/>Under the above first-noted assignment of error it will appear that the appellant does not contend that he did not violate the law, but his contention is that he did not violate it knowingly.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph (<i>a<\/i>) of section 10 of Act No. 1396 of\u00a0 the Philippine Commission provides for an annual tax for road\u00a0 construction\u00a0 and improvement of P2 on every male inhabitant in the province over 18 and under 60 years of age, except soldiers and sailors, etc., and\u00a0 also\u00a0 provides that persons upon whom this tax is imposed shall be deemed to be delinquent after the 1st day of February of each year.\u00a0 Paragraph (<i>a<\/i>) of said section 19 is as follows :<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 19.

That said tax, as provided for by said section, had not been paid for the year 1907 at the time the defendant made the above affidavit (elector's oath) on the 29th day of June, 1907.<br\/><br\/>Third. That some time prior to the\u00a0 said 29th day of June, 1907, the name of the defendant appeared upon\u00a0 a list of persons delinquent in the payment of the cedula and road taxes, posted in the office of the provincial treasurer of the Province of Mindoro.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.

The law did not require the provincial treasurer\u00a0 to notify those who were obligated to pay the tax provided for in said section 19 that they were delinquent. Said\u00a0 Act No.\u00a0 1396\u00a0 had been in force in\u00a0 the\u00a0 Philippine Islands for nearly two years prior to the time when the defendant made said affidavit or elector's oath and he had already once paid the tax in accordance with the provisions of said law.<br\/><br\/>The only question presented by the appellant is whether or not he knowingly violated the provisions of said law; that is, whether he knew at the time he took the said oath that he was delinquent in the payment of said road tax. He admits that the law was read to him just\u00a0 before he took the oath.\u00a0 The law is plain.\u00a0 It simply provides that those who do not pay the tax \"shall be deemed to be delinquent after the first day of February of each year.\"\u00a0 It seems to be difficult to understand the contention of the defendant.\u00a0 During\u00a0 the trial he admitted that the reason for not paying the tax for the year 1907, as\u00a0 he had done in the year 1906, was that he did not have the money.<br\/><br\/>Suppose, for\u00a0 instance, that the defendant had been prosecuted for a failure to pay said tax or to perform the work in lieu thereof, and had made as his defense in that action that he did not know that he was\u00a0 delinquent.\u00a0\u00a0 Could he thereby have defeated the imposition of the penalties provided for in paragraph (b) of said section 19 above quoted? In other words, could he have plead his ignorance of the law as his defense?\u00a0 Under the penal\u00a0 clause of paragraph (<i>b<\/i>) of said section 19 he could only be punished upon the theory that he was delinquent.\u00a0 We are not of the opinion that his ignorance of the provisions of the law would have constituted a defense in that action.\u00a0 And, moreover, the defendant resided in the capital of the province.\u00a0 The provincial treasurer, long prior to the 29th day of June, 1907, had prepared a list of the persons of the province who were delinquent in the payment of the said tax.\u00a0\u00a0 Had the defendant been\u00a0 anxious to know, as a matter of fact, whether he was a delinquent or not, he might\u00a0 easily have ascertained this fact upon inquiry of the provincial treasurer. But, as was said above, the mere reading of the law was sufficient to give him the information that the said tax was due and payable prior to the 1st day of February of each year, and those who had not paid\u00a0 said tax prior to said date were delinquent.<br\/><br\/>From all of the facts disclosed by the record, we are of the opinion that the defendant did make the said affidavit knowing\u00a0 that he had not paid said tax in\u00a0 accordance with the law, and was therefore delinquent, and that, therefore, lie knowingly took and subscribed to a false oath before the election officer.\u00a0 Those who desire to participate in\u00a0 the affairs of the Government must be willing to comply with its laws mid to support the same.<br\/><br\/>In view of all the facts, however, we are of the opinion that the\u00a0 sentence of the lower court should be modified, and that the defendant should be sentenced to pay a line of 200 with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Tracey, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">ARELLANO, C.J., MAPA<\/span> AND <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">WILLARD, JJ.,<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> dissenting<\/span>;<br\/><br\/>We agree with the conclusions contained in the brief of the Attorney-General and are of the opinion that the defendant should be acquitted.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/> <sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> The fallowing cases, involving the same\u00a0 point, were considered and decided at the same time with the same result: No. 4294, U.

Counsel for appellant also contend that the trial court erred in giving judgment in favor of the plaintiff for 527, one-half\u00a0 the face value of certain so-called \"chits\"\u00a0 or promises to pay, which defendant held in his possession for collection for the benefit of a partnership in which plaintiff and defendant were equal partners.\u00a0 It is not denied that the defendant and appellant held the \"chits\" in question for collection, but it is urged that, since it does not appear that he collected more than\u00a0 302 on\u00a0 account of these \"chits,\" he should be held responsible to his partners for no more than 151, one-half the amount actually collected.<br\/><br\/>The trial court held that the defendant was responsible to the plaintiff, his partner, for one-half of the\u00a0 face value of all the \"chits\" in his hands for collection, because, in the language of the opinion, \"he has not rendered a definite and concrete accounting of each of the 'chits' that he has not collected,\" and it\u00a0 must be admitted that this language is subject to more than one construction.\u00a0 It may be construed to mean\u00a0 either that the defendant failed to make an accounting of the \"chits\" in his hands for collection and declined to produce or surrender the\u00a0 \"chits\" which he alleged he had been unable to collect,\" or it may be\u00a0 construed so as to mean that he failed to explain satisfactorily the reason for his failure to recover the total amount due on the \"chits\" in his \"hands for collection.\u00a0 If this finding be given the\u00a0 latter construction,\u00a0 the contention of the appellant should be sustained, because the \"chits\" being in the hands of the defendant merely for collection, his failure so to do in no wise burdened him with the obligation of paying over their face value to the partnership, unless it affixmatively appeared that his failure to recover such face value was due to some fault or neglect on his part; and if at or prior to the trial he had turned\u00a0 over for the benefit of the partnership the\u00a0 uncollected\u00a0 \"chits\"\u00a0 together with\u00a0 the amount of cash collected on account of those actually paid, he could not properly be held to any further responsibility. But if the first, and as it seems to us, the more reasonable construction, be put upon the language of the\u00a0 trial court, the failure of the defendant to account for and produce the \"chits\" which he alleged he had been unable to collect, rendered him\u00a0 responsible to the partnership\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 full amount of the face value\u00a0 of such \"chits,\" and judgment was properly rendered against him for one-half of the total amount of the \"chits\" which came into his possession.\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence of record not being before us, it is impossible for us to say that this is not the proper construction which should be put upon the language used by\u00a0 the trial court; and we do not think that we would be justified in reversing the judgment of the court below on the ground that there is error in its conclusions\u00a0 if a possible construction be given the language used in its decision, when a reasonable construction of the language used fully sustains\u00a0 the conclusions of the court and the judgment based thereon.\u00a0 If the appellant was not satisfied\u00a0 with the findings of fact by the trial judge, it was his duty to bring the evidence here on appeal in\u00a0 order that erroneous findings might be\u00a0 reviewed and corrected.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the trial court should be and is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

R. Duffin, the \"New Coin Cafe,\" a bar or drinking saloon situated in the city of Manila. By the terms of the contract the purchaser agreed to pay the owner of the property where the bar was located the sum of Pl,200 in monthly installments of P100 each, rent due for the occupation of the building; to pay a debt due from the seller to Macke, Chandler &amp; Co. amounting to P112, and to pay to the plaintiff P600 on the 28th of February, 1907, and P588 on the 28th of February, 1908. The contract contained also the following conditions:<br\/><blockquote>\"IV. That both contracting parties bind themselves to a strict compliance with the present contract, which, in case of nonfulfillment of any of its clauses by either of the parties, shall be rescinded.<br\/><br\/>\"V. That in case the purchaser, Carmen de Pascual de Duffin, should infringe any of the clauses or provisions of this contract, the same shall be rescinded in accordance with the preceding clause, and said purchaser will immediately return to the vendor the bar with all its appurtenances, furniture and any other improvements made therein, without the right, on the part of the said purchaser, to any remuneration for such improvements.\"<\/blockquote>The purchaser took possession of the bar but did not pay the rent due in the month of December nor did she pay the whole of the sum due the defendants Macke, Chandler &amp; Co. She became the debtor of Macke, Chandler &amp; Co. for other merchandise sold to her by them; on the 8th of January they commenced an action against her to recover the amount due them and on the 9th of January caused the personal property in the bar to be attached by the sheriff. On the 16th of January the plaintiff notified the sheriff of his rights in regard to the bar. The sheriff secured a bond from Macke, Chandler &amp; Co., disregarded the notice, and on the 18th of January, 1907, sold the personal property therein for the sum of P410.90. The plaintiff commenced this action on the 26th of January, 1907, against Carmen de Pascual, her husband, C. E. Duffin, Macke, Chandler &amp; Co., and the sheriff of the city of Manila. Judgment was rendered in the court below in favor of the plaintiff and against Carmen de Pascual and her husband by default in the sum of P4,000. From this judgment these defendants have not appealed.<br\/><br\/>Judgment was rendered in the court below in favor of Macke, Chandler &amp; Co., and the sheriff, acquitting them of the complaint. From this part of the judgment the plaintiff has appealed.<br\/><br\/>By the express terms of the contract, which have been above quoted, the plaintiff had the right to rescind it in case the purchaser failed to comply with the terms thereof. That the purchaser did fail so to comply, is admitted; and that the plaintiff had a perfect right to rescind the contract as against the purchaser, can not be questioned, and is not questioned, they having not appealed from the judgment against them. But the question is, what rights has the plaintiff against third persons, namely, Macke, Chandler &amp; Co. and the sheriff?<br\/><br\/>It is evident that article 1290 and following articles of the Civil Code do not refer to the rescission of contracts such as the one is question. (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain, April 24, 1901.) The rights of the parties to this action are rather governed by articles 1506 and 1124 of that code.\u00a0\u00a0 Article 1124,1s as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The right to rescind the obligations is considered as implied in mutual ones, in case one of the obligated persons does not comply with what is incumbent upon him.<br\/><br\/>\"The person prejudiced may choose between exacting the fulfillment of the obligation or its rescission, with indemnity for damages and payment of interest in either case. He may also demand the rescission, even after having requested its fulfillment, should the latter appear impossible.<br\/><br\/>\"The court shall order the rescission demanded, unless there are sufficient causes authorizing it to fix a period.<br\/><br\/>\"This is understood without prejudice to the rights of third acquirers, in accordance with articles 1295 and 1298, and the provisions of the Mortgage Law.\"<\/blockquote>It is true that this article does not directly refer to contracts which expressly give the right to rescind. But, that it was intended to apply to them, we think is evident.<br\/><br\/>Article 1295 referred to in article 1124 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Rescission obliges the return of the things which were the objects of the contract, with their fruits and the sum with interest; therefore it can only be carried into effect when the person who may have claimed it can return that which, on his part, he is bound to do.<br\/><br\/>\"Neither shall rescission take place when the things which are the object of the contract are legally in the possession of third persons who have not acted in bad faith.<br\/><br\/>\"In such case the indemnity for damages may be claimed from the person who caused the lesion.\"<\/blockquote>The only question in the case is whether or not the plaintiff has the right to rescind this contract against Macke, Chandler &amp; Co. and the sheriff, who are third parties, and that question depends upon whether they are legally in possession of the property and have acted in good faith.<br\/><br\/>The mere failure to fulfill the contract did not operate as a rescission thereof. It was necessary that the plaintiff take some affirmative action indicating his intention to rescind it. (Judgment [supreme court of Spain] of the 19th of January, 1904.)<br\/><br\/>As to the defendants, Macke, Chandler &amp; Co., we do not think that the evidence shows that any such action was taken by the plaintiff prior to the sale on the 18tji day of January, 1907. The plaintiff alleged that on the 16th day of January he notified the sheriff in writing that he was the owner of the property. This allegation is denied in the answer of the defendants, Macke, Chandler &amp; Co., and, while one of the witnesses testified that a notice was given, he did not testify what the contents of that notice were and the notice itself was apparently not introduced in evidence. So far as Macke, Chandler &amp; Co. are concerned, the judgment in their favor must be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>But as to the sheriff, different facts appear. Instead of denying the allegations of the complaint in respect to the notice, the sheriff in his answer expressly admitted those allegations and affirmatively alleged the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"That on the 16th day of January, 1907, the plaintiff in this case presented an affidavit to this defendant, claiming to be the owner of the aforesaid property, and according to that notice this defendant required and obtained from the said B. H. Macke and W. N. Chandler, a bond to indemnify this defendant for whatever damages he might suffer by reason of the sale of said property in order to satisfy the above referred execution.\"<\/blockquote>It thus appears that the sheriff had a copy of the contract in his possession before he made the sale; that he knew that the plaintiff had a right to rescind it, and that he knew from the affidavit made that the plaintiff claimed to be the owner of the property and therefore had rescinded it. Under these circumstances it can not be said that the sheriff, when he had possession of the goods for the purpose of selling them on execution, was in possession of them in good faith, within the meaning of that phrase as it is used in article 1295.<br\/><br\/>This action, in which the plaintiff asked expressly that the contract be declared rescinded, was commenced on the 26th day of January, ten days after the notice was given to the sheriff and eight days after the sale. The plaintiff had the right to have the contract rescinded not only against the original parties thereto but also against the sheriff.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff presented no evidence to show what the value of the property actually sold by the sheriff was. He presented evidence to show what the value of certain improvements made by Carmen de Pascual was, but these improvements to a large extent were not susceptible of sale on execution and were not sold. The only evidence to show what the value of the property sold by the sheriff was, is what it brought, namely, P410.90, and as against the sheriff this must be taken as its value.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below in favor of Macke, Chandler &amp; Co. is affirmed. The judgment in favor of the sheriff is reversed, and judgment is entered against aim and in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P410.90, with interest thereon from the 26th day of January, 1907, and the costs of the Court of First Instance. No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson, <\/i>and <i>Tracey, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<\/div>",

From this judgment the defendant only has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The defendant in his answer did not deny under oath the execution of the document above quoted. He therefore admitted its authenticity. At the trial he asked leave to amend his answer by inserting a denial under oath as to the execution of the contract. Whether the refusal to allow this amendment was or was not error it is not necessary to determine because the defendant, himself, in his brief, admitted that he executed the document, but claimed that it involved fraud and deceit. This deceit could have been shown by the defendant under his original answer. We find no evidence in the case to show that the execution of this document was obtained by any fraud or deceit practiced by the plaintiff, nor do we find that the court ruled out any evidence presented by the defendant for the purpose of establishing that fact. He was allowed to, and did show that some of the material used in the contract was not the material indicated in the specifications. But this did not prove, nor tend to prove that his consent to the contract of the 21st of August was obtained by fraud. He had before signing that contract ample opportunity to examine the work and determine for himself whether it complied with the terms of the contract or not. His express acceptance without protest was an acknowledgment by him that the work had been performed substantially as required by the contract.

The plaintiff, in any event, was entitled to recover the balance due on his original contract but he was not entitled to recover the 400 pesos unless he showed that his guaranty had been complied with for three years. The court below found from the evidence presented by the defendant that he had not fulfilled this guaranty and therefore refused to allow him any part of the 400 pesos. But his failure to make such proof did not affect his right to recover the balance due on the original contract.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

ROXAS, RESPONDENTS AND APPELLANTS. <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MAPA, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court\u00a0 of Land Registration.\u00a0 The petitioner applied for the registration his property, situated at\u00a0 22 Calle San\u00a0 Jacinto, district\u00a0 of Binondo, Manila, free from\u00a0 all incumbrances, with the exception of an easement of right of way which he recognizes as existing in favor of the estates of the respondents Lichauco and Hijos de Roxas, which adjoin the property of the petitioner on the right and left\u00a0 of its entrance, respectively.\u00a0 In addition to the\u00a0 said easement of right of way the respondents claim that\u00a0 of light, view, and drainage in favor of their respective properties; said claim was modified in part during the course of the litigation\u00a0 as far as it\u00a0 referred to Julita Lichauco,\u00a0 who finally, reduced her opposition (fol. 138) to the easement of right of way and of light and view.<br\/><br\/>In the judgment appealed from it is held that the easement of right of way exists in favor\u00a0 of the\u00a0 respective properties of Julita Lichauco and Hijos de Roxas, and the latter are further entitled to the easement of drainage.\u00a0 The claim of both respondents as to other easements was dismissed.<br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>) Opposition made by Julita Lichauco.\u00a0 This opponent invokes as the only legal\u00a0 foundation for her claim the provisions of article 541 of the Civil Code.The language of said provision is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The existence of an apparent sign of an easement between two estates established by the owner of both shall be considered, should one of them be alienated,\u00a0 as a title, in order that the easement may continue actively and passively, unless, at the time of the division of the ownership of both estates, the contrary should be expressed in the instrument of alienation of either of them, or if said sign is removed before the execution of the instrument.\"<\/blockquote>It is alleged by Lichauco, as a material fact for applying the above legal\u00a0 provision, that her property, as well as that of the petitioner, came from Juan\u00a0 Bautista Santa Coloma, the original owner of both estates, who,\u00a0 at the time of constructing them, established upon the latter estate, not only an easement of right of way, which the petitioner admits, but also the easement of light and view which she\u00a0 claims; and that when both properties were alienated, that of the petitioner\u00a0 on the 28th of November, 1848,\u00a0 and that of the respondent (Julita Lichauco)\u00a0 on, the 31st of October of the same year,\u00a0 the apparent sign\u00a0 of the existence of\u00a0 said easement was not removed, nor was it expressed in the instrument of alienation of the estates that such easements should be abolished.<br\/><br\/>The apparent sign of the easements claimed in this case is made to consist of a gallery with windows through which light is admitted.\u00a0 In her written opposition Lichauco states that the said gallery is supported on columns erected on the ground belonging to the petitioner, and on the\u00a0 first page of her brief submitted to\u00a0 this court she again states that the balcony of her building is supported by uprights erected on land owned by the petitioner.<br\/><br\/>The parties to the suit having admitted the actual existence of the aforesaid gallery, the question\u00a0 now\u00a0 to be decided is whether or not it existed when the ownership of the two estates of Juan Bautista Santa Coloma was divided by the alienation of the one which now belongs to the respondent (Lichauco) and which was the first sold on October 31,\u00a0 1848.<br\/><br\/>The instrument of sale (fol. 78)\u00a0 presented by said respondent contains a description of said house such as it was\u00a0 at that time, and after setting forth the boundaries thereof, states that the house is built of stone and mortar, and\u00a0 that it is erected upon the lot of the owner, and has a frontage of twenty and one-fourth <i>varas<\/i> and three and a half inches, with a depth of thirty-one and one-fourth <i>varas<\/i>.\u00a0 Converting the <i>varas<\/i> into meters and disregarding the centimeters, it results that said house had a frontage of 16 meters, equivalent to the twenty and one-fourth <i>varas<\/i> and\u00a0 three and a half inches stated in the instrument when it\u00a0 was alienated\u00a0 for the first\u00a0 time in October, 1848. Twenty years thereafter\u2014that is, on the 13th of September,\u00a0 1869\u2014the house was\u00a0 surveyed and\u00a0 appraised\u00a0 by Architect Luciano Oliver at the request of the person who then\u00a0 owned it, and in the certificate issued by the said architect (fol. 94) it is set forth that the house measures <i>16 meters on the front facing Calle San Jacinto<\/i>\u00a0 which confirms and corroborates the measurement stated\u00a0 in the aforesaid\u00a0 instrument.\u00a0 Now then, according to the plan on folio 137, Exhibit I of the respondent (Lichanco), the house has now a frontage of 18 meters and 60 centimeters, of which 16 meters and 60 centimeters correspond\u00a0 to the main part of the\u00a0 same, and\u00a0 1 meter and 90 centimeters to the gallery in question.\u00a0 It results, therefore, that at the present day, the house has nearly 2 meters more frontage\u00a0 than\u00a0 when it was alienated\u00a0 by Santa\u00a0 Coloma, the original owner thereof, or rather by the executors\u00a0 of his estate on the 31st of October, 1848.<br\/><br\/>According to this it is evident that the front line of the house was increased by about 2 meters after the same was sold by Santa Coloma, and it also seems clear to us that it is the gallery\u00a0 mentioned above which constitutes the increase, both because it measures 1 meter and 90 centimeters, which, with\u00a0 a difference of a\u00a0 few centimeters, exactly represents such excess, and because it has neither been alleged nor claimed by the said respondent, that the rest which forms the main part of the\u00a0 house has suffered any alteration in its frontage since the year 1848.<br\/><br\/>There is furthermore another detail\u00a0 in support of said conclusion.\u00a0 As stated by the respondent,\u00a0 the\u00a0 gallery is supported by <i>columns erected on the\u00a0 lot of\u00a0 the petitioner,<\/i> so that it is not merely a body projecting over the said lot\u00a0 without materially resting thereon but a construction erected and having foundations in the lot of the petitioner, inasmuch as the columns that support the said gallery are planted therein.\u00a0 Therefore, at the present day the\u00a0 house is erected partly on\u00a0 land\u00a0 belonging to the owner and partly,\u00a0 the gallery, .over a lot belonging to another; that is, over that of the petitioner.\u00a0 When it was sold in October, 1848,\u00a0 no portion\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 house occupied the lot last mentioned, but the entire building was erected over a <i>lot belonging to the owner<\/i> as set forth in the instrument of sale.<br\/><br\/>To the foregoing considerations the following may\u00a0 be added in conclusion:\u00a0 In\u00a0 view of the fact that the two buildings\u2014namely, that of the petitioner and that of the respondent\u2014originally belonged to the same owner, and on the supposition that the gallery did already exist and that, as stated, it is supported on columns\u00a0 erected in the lot now owned by the petitioner, it is not an easy matter to explain how it was that when the ownership of the two properties was separated\u00a0 the house of the respondent,\u00a0 of which the said gallery forms a part, was sold to one person while the lot over which said gallery is erected or in which its columns are embedded was sold to a different person. It would be a logical\u00a0 and natural thing to suppose that in the sale of the gallery the land occupied by the same would have been included in order to avoid the division of the ownership of\u00a0 the ground and the superficies,\u00a0 that is, the lot and that which is erected upon it. The necessity for such division does not appear nor can any reasonable justification therefor be discovered in, the present case.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, in none of the numerous papers presented by the respondent is\u00a0 there any\u00a0 mention made of the gallery in question, notwithstanding the fact that in some of them the house of the\u00a0 respondent\u00a0 (Lichauco) is minutely described.\u00a0 And it\u00a0 does not seem that this is due to mere\u00a0 carelessness or\u00a0 inadvertence,\u00a0 or\u00a0 that it was considered unnecessary to mention said\u00a0 gallery, inasmuch as a deliberate, careful,\u00a0 and repeated mention is made of the other gallery on the side of the house facing the street, as may be seen from several of the\u00a0 other documents above alluded to,\u00a0 among\u00a0 which are\u00a0 the certificate issued by Architect Luciano Oliver on September 13,1869, (fol.\u00a0 .94), the instrument of : sale\u00a0 executed\u00a0 in favor\u00a0 of Manuel Gonzalez Junquito (fol. 104), and the mortgage deed\u00a0 of the\u00a0 same date in favor of the Obras Pias\u00a0 (fol. 116).\u00a0 In each of the said documents the statement is made that the house has a <i>corridor supported on columns<\/i> on Calle\u00a0 San Jacinto, while nothing\u00a0 is said, even\u00a0 incidentally,\u00a0 regarding the other corridor or gallery that now exists over the lot of the petitioner.\u00a0 In our opinion there is no reason why in the description of the house, as made by various persons at\u00a0 different times,\u00a0 mention\u00a0 should always have been made of only\u00a0 one of the galleries, the other being entirely ignored, if both had really existed on the respective dates of the documents above referred to.<br\/><br\/>And it is useless to say, as argued\u00a0 by the\u00a0 respondent in her brief, that Architect Oliver's certificate,\u00a0 from which the description\u00a0 made\u00a0 in the subsequent documents was taken, contained but a superficial description of the property without details of\u00a0 its four sides.\u00a0 For\u00a0 said\u00a0 reason she states that the fact that no\u00a0 mention is made of the balcony or gallery in question is\u00a0 of no importance, as the said certificate deals with the value of the property only, it being well known that such a work is performed taking into account all the details and circumstances\u00a0 which\u00a0 may increase or decrease the\u00a0 value of the same.\u00a0 Hence, the respondent goes\u00a0 on to say, that mention was made, by said architect, of the\u00a0 veranda facing the street\u00a0 for the <i>purpose of distinguishing between the one built on private land and the one which was built over land belonging to the city.<\/i>\u00a0 For the very same reason she should have mentioned also the veranda built over the lot of the petitioner, if it had been in\u00a0 existence,\u00a0 especially as the value of a property\u00a0 erected on land belonging to the owner is\u00a0 not the same as that which is constructed on land owned by another\u00a0 person.\u00a0 The omission of this detail in such a document wherein in order to omit nothing mention is even made of a well and stable both of which are unimportant portions of a building; such an omission, we say added to the reasons given above, induces us to come to the\u00a0 conclusion,\u00a0 as a result of the documentary\u00a0 evidence adduced at the trial, that the gallery in question did\u00a0 not exist at\u00a0 the time when the house of the\u00a0 respondent was alienated by its original owner, Santa Coloma, in October, 1848.<br\/><br\/>This conclusion is not weakened by the expert testimony offered by the respondent, the only testimony which\u00a0 she introduced aside from the documentary evidence already mentioned.\u00a0 As\u00a0 the judgment appealed from properly states, even if the forty or fifty years of existence\u00a0 of the house referred to, according to the unanimous reckoning of the experts offered by said party is accepted, yet, we do not reach\u00a0 the year 1848, more than fifty-seven years back, when the separation of the ownership of said house and\u00a0 that of the petitioner took place;\u00a0 such date constitutes the essential and culminating point pf the question. Moreover, it does not appear that said experts, who, among other things, base their opinion on the\u00a0 condition of\u00a0 the building and its materials, have made a careful and sufficient examination\u00a0 and survey of the\u00a0 latter.\u00a0 This is evidenced by the fact that one of them, Enrique Lafuente, states,\u00a0 on folio 146, that the\u00a0 columns which support the gallery facing the street are built of stone, and that those of the\u00a0 other gallery over the lot of the petitioner are\u00a0 of wood; while according to another, Ramon Herrera Davila, (fol. 152) both sets of columns are built of stone, and the third, Jose Perez Siguenza (fol. 157), aflftrms that they are all built of\u00a0 wood,\u00a0 those\u00a0 facing the street as\u00a0 well as those embedded\u00a0 in the land of the petitioner.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, all the experts discuss and reason, and render their opinion as if the house was in the same condition as when sold by Santa Coloma in 1848, when it seems certain and\u00a0 unquestionable that long after the said year it underwent, or must have undergone, very important repairs of\u00a0 an essential nature.\u00a0 This is shown by the letter written by Manuel Gonzalez\u00a0 Junquito, who owned it at the time, to his attorney in fact\u00a0 under date of March 25, 1889, and\u00a0 was\u00a0 incorporated in the instrument of sale executed by said attorney in fact of the owner in favor of the respondent.\u00a0 In said letter Junquito states that the house <i>was converted into a heap of ruins, and that<\/i> (undoubtedly for the\u00a0 said\u00a0 reason)\u00a0 <i>during\u00a0 three years it had not yielded him a single cent; for this reason he prayed <\/i>his said attorney <i>to see the way to sell it by all means at the best price obtainable<\/i> *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\u00a0 It was thus that the said house which, as stated by Junquito in the same letter, had\u00a0 cost him 15,000 pesos was sold to the respondent for only 8,000.\u00a0 If in 1889 the\u00a0 house was a heap\u00a0 of ruins, it seems to us too hazardous to certify solely in\u00a0 view of its present condition, after undergoing repairs or haying been practically rebuilt, the real condition\u00a0 in which it\u00a0 was in 1848\u2014that is,\u00a0 forty years before it became ruined\u2014especially since, as the petitioner's\u00a0 expert properly states, in the repair or rebuilding of the property old or used materials may have been employed which would\u00a0 give it\u00a0 the appearance of being older than\u00a0 it actually is.<br\/><br\/>The respondent states in her brief, as though intending to prove the great antiquity of the gallery in question, that, notwithstanding the fact that the petitioner acquired his property before she acquired the\u00a0 adjoining building, he has not been able to testify that the said gallery was built by Julita Lichauco or by her predecessor after he had purchased his property, nor has it been proven that since that time or at any time previous thereto there had been any disagreement between the owners of the two properties on\u00a0 account of the gallery in question.\u00a0\u00a0 Such allegation absolutely lacks foundation, (1) because it is not true that the petitioner\u00a0 acquired his property prior to the time when Julita Lichauco acquired hers, but entirely on the contrary since the petitioner purchased his property on the 9th of May, 1894, and the respondent acquired hers on the 25th of October, 1889, that is, five years previously; and (2) because the burden is not on the petitioner\u00a0 to prove at what time the gallery in controversy was constructed inasmuch as he limits\u00a0 himself to sustaining and defending the freedom of his property, denying the easements of light and view that the\u00a0 respondent pretends\u00a0 to impose over it.\u00a0 It is a settled doctrine of law that a property is assumed to be free from all incumbrance unless the contrary is proved.\u00a0 (Decisions\u00a0 of the supreme court of Spain of April 7, 1864, and December 13, 1805.)\u00a0\u00a0 The respondent who claims the said\u00a0 easements, basing her claim on the provisions of article 541 of the Civil Code, is obliged to prove that the aforementioned gallery, in which the apparent sign of the easement is made to consist in the present case, existed at1 the time the ownership of her\u00a0 property and\u00a0 that of the\u00a0 petitioner were separated,\u00a0 in October, 1848.\u00a0 And inasmuch as this issue has not been\u00a0 proved, the claim of the respondent\u00a0 as\u00a0 to the easements of light and view, which the petitioner does not admit,\u00a0 must of necessity be dismissed.<br\/><br\/><i>(b)<\/i> Opposition of the heirs of Francisco L. Roxas.\u00a0 The real terms of this\u00a0 opposition do not appear well defined. As the Court of Land Registration says in the judgment appealed from, when this party appeared at the trial\u00a0 it stated (fol. 71) that it\u00a0 had no opposition to offer and only desired that the matter of the easement of right\u00a0 of way, acknowledged\u00a0 by\u00a0 the petitioner,\u00a0 be clearly\u00a0 established, and that the other rights of easement which their property holds over the former\u00a0 be respected, not specifying, however, either at the time or during the course\u00a0 of the proceedings as to which of said easements they referred when appearing.\u00a0 Hence the questions raised by these respondents do not appear as clearly determined.<br\/><br\/>In the absence of due specification of the said points, and inferring it only from the language of the agreement submitted by the parties to the suit, the Court of Land Registration assumed that beyond\u00a0 the acknowledged easement of the right of way, the respondents claimed those of light, view, and drainage, and on such supposition entered judgment in connection with said easements only. Upon moving for a new hearing the respondent alleged as a foundation therefor, as stated in the overruling thereof (p. 9 of the bill of exceptions),\u00a0 that the easement with reference to\u00a0 balconies had not been acknowledged, and now;in setting forth their injuries before this court they speak of the<i> eaves<\/i> *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.<br\/><br\/>Admitting, for the sake of argument, that all of the above\u00a0 questions were duly set up and discussed in\u00a0 the court below, the fact is that in the judgment appealed from no\u00a0 other easements than those with reference\u00a0 to right of way and drainage from the roof have been allowed in favor of the property of the respondents; therefore, the easements of light, view, and balconies remain in dispute in the present instance.\u00a0 The easement with reference to eaves mentioned also in the brief of the respondents should, in our opinion, be discarded inasmuch as it is included in this case in the easement of\u00a0 drainage from the roof acknowledged in the judgment appealed from.\u00a0 (P. 7 of the bill\u00a0 of exceptions.)<br\/><br\/>The Court of Land Registration in order to dismiss the opposition with reference to\u00a0 the easement of light and view bases its decision on the fact that, the same being negative, according to article 533 of the Civil Code, because the owner of the\u00a0 servient estate is prohibited to do something which he could lawfully do if the easement did not exist, the time of possession for prescription\u00a0 (and it is a\u00a0 matter of prescription for the reason that the respondents hold no title)\u00a0 should\u00a0 begin to run,\u00a0 not from the date of the existence of the windows or balconies, but from the day when the owner of the dominant estate, by means of a formal act, might have\u00a0 prohibited the owner of the servient estate to do something which he could properly\u00a0 execute if the easement did not exist; this was never carried out by the opponents or by their principals as agreed to by the parties at the hearing.<br\/><br\/>In rebuttal of this portion of the judgment the respondents state in their brief as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"We agree with the trial court that as a general rule the easement with reference to view is a negative one ***; but we understand that there are cases in which the easement is positive because it imposes on the owner Of the\u00a0 servient estate the obligation to allow the owner of the dominant estate to do on the property of the former something which the latter could not lawfully do if the easement did not exist, *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * such as happens in the present case in which the windows have a balcony projecting over the lot of the petitioner.\u00a0 In the case at bar there exists the positive fact of windows with projecting balconies opening <i>over<\/i> the land of the servient estate which is not\u00a0 a right inherent to the dominion of the owner of the dominant estate, but a real invasion of the right of another, a positive act which limits the dominion of the owner of the servient estate which, constituting an easement, imposes on him the obligation to permit the owner of the dominant estate to have such\u00a0 windows with balconies projecting <i>over<\/i> his estate.\"<\/blockquote>According to this no question is raised by the respondents as to the legal nature of the easement of view (in their brief the easement of light is ignored)\u00a0 which\u00a0 they acknowledge for the reason that, in general, it is a negative one although in their opinion there are exceptions where it acquires the nature of a positive easement, among them, when as in the present case,\u00a0 view is obtained by means of windows with balconies projecting <i>over<\/i> the adjoining estate.\u00a0 On page 4 of their brief they state that the latter fact was agreed to by the parties, which is tacitly contradicted by the petitioner when\u00a0 denying, on page 14 of his brief, that the word <i>balconies<\/i> was used in the agreement as synonymous with projecting windows and differing from windows, for although, according to the said agreement, they overlook the lot of\u00a0 the petitioner, they are not, however, over the same, nor\u00a0 is the contrary claimed\u00a0 in connection therewith by the representative of the respondents.<br\/><br\/>In reference to the above question the said agreement of facts reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"(1)\u00a0 That house No. 114, Calle San Jacinto, district\u00a0 of Binondo, this city, owned by the children of Francisco L. Roxas, adjoining the property of the petitioner, underwent alterations in the early part of the year 1882, and ever since that\u00a0 time it exists as it appears now with windows and views overlooking the lot of the petitioner, with balconies and eaves from which rainfall drops on the aforesaid lot.\"<\/blockquote>It seems evident under the terms of this agreement, that the house of\u00a0 the respondents has balconies, it being immaterial for our point\u00a0 of view that\u00a0 the word <i>balconies<\/i>\u00a0 be taken as synonymous with windows or projections, since whether it be the one or the other the truth is that the agreement does not state that such balconies are over the lot\u00a0 of the petitioner\u00a0 or overlooking it, as claimed by the respondents.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither would this\u00a0 follow from the mere fact that the said balconies jut out, because the projecting parts of a building may be constructed, and as a matter of fact they are generally\u00a0 constructed, <i>over<\/i> the area of their own ground without invading the limits of the adjoining\u00a0 land.\u00a0 What actually falls over the estate of the petitioner according to the agreement is the water dropping from the <i>projecting eaves<\/i> of the respondents' house, which is precisely the fact that has originated the easement of drainage from the roof acknowledged\u00a0 in favor of said house; projecting eaves, thus the agreement reads, <i>from which part of its water falls mi said lot. <\/i> Notwithstanding the fact that the word <i>eaves<\/i>, in the\u00a0 language of the agreement, is preceded by the word <i>balconies<\/i>, upon\u00a0 both being united\u00a0 by the copulative conjunction <i>and<\/i>, it becomes evident that the words in italics\u00a0 do not refer nor could they refer to the balconies\u00a0 for the simple reason that their object is not to\u00a0 shed the water, a thing which, on the contrary, is done by the eaves. <br\/><br\/>And that it is the water and not the balconies of the house of the respondents\u00a0 which falls <i>over <\/i>or overlooks the lot of the petitioner, is further evidenced by the language of the\u00a0 other clauses\u00a0 of the agreement in which the ideas are expressed with precision, from which\u00a0 it may\u00a0 be seen that the preposition <i>over<\/i> is always in relation to the fall of the water and not to the balconies.\u00a0 Thus,\u00a0 for example, clause 2 reads \"that it does not appear if the construction of said windows, balconies, and projecting eaves, as well as that part of the water from the roof of the said house, <i>fall on<\/i> the lot now owned by Don Miguel Fabie *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"\u00a0 . And this very same thing is twice repeated in clause 3, \"that on the part of the\u00a0 children of Francisco L. Roxas there has not been an act of opposition to prevent Miguel Fabie *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * work that may obstruct the light, remove the windows or balconies and projecting eaves of the said house which now belongs to the children of Francisco L. Roxas, or prevent a portion of the water from the roof\u00a0 of the same from falling on the lot of Miguel Fabie *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *,\u00a0 neither has there been on\u00a0 the part of the said Fabie *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * any act to obstruct said light or windows, preventing the continuance of the balconies and projecting eaves,\u00a0 or that <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">part of the water<\/span> from the roof of the house\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">falling *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<\/span> <i>on his lot\" <\/i><br\/><br\/>Therefore, it does not appear from the agreement, which is the only evidence we have before us, no other having been offered at the hearing, that the house of the respondents has balconies <i>over<\/i> the land of the petitioner; and as it is, since it has not been positively shown\u00a0 that the said balconies exceed the limit of the lot owned by the former, nor less that they invade the atmospheric area of the lot belonging to the latter, it follows that, even in\u00a0 accordance with the theory maintained by the respondents with which, on account of its lack of basis, we consider it unnecessary to deal herein as to its other aspect, the easement of view, which might result in such case from the existence of the balconies alluded to, would be negative and not a positive one, because the erection of the same would not constitute, according to their own statement, an invasion of the right of another, but the lawful exercise of the right inherent to the dominion of the respondents to construct within their, own lot.\u00a0 And as said easement is negative, it can not have prescribed in favor of\u00a0 the property of the respondents in the absence of any act of opposition, according to the agreement, by which they or their principals would\u00a0 have prohibited the petitioner or his principals to do any work which might obstruct the balconies in question, inasmuch as said act of opposition is what constitutes the necessary and indispensable point of departure\u00a0 for computing the time required by law for the\u00a0 prescription of negative easements.\u00a0 (Art. 538, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>After the foregoing it is not necessary to say anything further to show the impropriety of the claim\u00a0 of the respondents in connection with the other easement of balconies\u00a0 <i>(projiciendi)<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0 They claim this easement on\u00a0 the supposition that the balconies of\u00a0 their house are or look <i>over<\/i> the lot of the petitioner; therefore, considering that this fact has not been proven, as shown heretofore, said pretension fails and can not prosper in any way.\u00a0 It is unnecessary to discuss the questions of law to which said fact might give rise had it been\u00a0 duly proven at the hearing.<br\/><br\/>For the reason above set forth, the judgment appealed from is affirmed in all its\u00a0 parts with the costs of this instance against the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The facts out of which this action grew are as follows: <p>On the 4th day of March, 1905, the said Carmen de la Cavada de Enriquez commenced an action in the court of the justice of the peace of the city of Manila for the purpose of recovering from Alexander Dragon the sum of P65 alleged to be due from the latter to the former as rent upon a contract for the use and occupation of a certain dwelling house in the city of Manila.<\/p> <p>On the 24th day of March, 1905, the said Carmen de la Cavada de Enriquez, through her attorney, presented the following petition for the arrest and detention of the said Alexander Dragon:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"The plaintiff in the above-entitled case appears and deposes:<\/p> <p>\"That the defendant, Alexander Dragon, owes her on account of rent due for the property Nos. 80, 84, and 76, Calle Numancia, owned by the plaintiff herein, the sum of P65, for the payment of which she has this day filed a proper complaint.<\/p> <p>\"That the plaintiff has no security whatever for the recovery of said claim.<\/p> <p>\"That the aforesaid Alexander Dragon has disposed of his property and is about to leave the Philippine Islands with intent to defraud his creditors, according to the annexed affidavit.<\/p> <p>\"That, therefore, the plaintiff requests that the detention of the said defendant be ordered, and that he be held in confinement until such time as he may pay the plaintiff or furnish sufficient and satisfactory security.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>Which petition was supported by the following affidavit:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"Know all men that I, Carmen de la Cavada de Enriquez, a resident of Manila, do hereby declare under oath:<\/p> <p>\"That I am the plaintiff in the above-entitled case.<\/p> <p>\"That the defendant, Alexander Dragon, on account of rent due on my property Nos. 80, 84, and 76, in Calle Numancia, district of San Nicolas, owes me the sum of P65, for the payment of which the corresponding complaint has this day been filed with the court of the justice of the peace of Manila.<\/p> <p>\"That the said Alexander Dragon has disposed of his property and is about to leave the Philippine Islands with intent to defraud his creditors.<\/p> <p>\"That I hold no security whatever for the recovery of my claim.<\/p> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr> <td width=\"50%\">[SEAL.]<\/td> <td width=\"50%\"><div align=\"right\">\"CARMEN C.

This motion was denied by the justice of the peace.<\/p> <p>On the 29th day of March, 1905, the said justice of the peace, after hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause upon the original complaint, rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Carmen de la Cavada de Enriquez, against the defendant, Alexander Dragon, for the sum of P58.60.<\/p> <p>From the foregoing order and sentence of the said justice of the peace, Alexander Dragon appealed to the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, which appeal was duly perfected.<\/p> <p>On the 12th day of June, 1905, the attorney for the said Dragon presented a motion in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, asking that the order of arrest issued by the said justice of the peace be declared without effect. The motion was based upon the following grounds:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"1. That the issuing of the order of arrest was contrary to the laws of the Philippine Islands, for the reason that no authority exists for the issuance of orders of arrest for debt.<\/p> <p>\"2. That the affidavit of the plaintiff is untrue and false.<\/p> <p>\"3. That the defendant had never intended to leave the Philippine Islands.<\/p> <p>\"4. That the defendant has not disposed of his property nor ever intended to do so except in connection with the needs of his business.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>On the 21st of August, 1905, the judge of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, after hearing the respective attorneys upon the said motion, made the following order:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"This case is on for hearing upon motion of the defendant to vacate the order of arrest made herein by the justice of the peace and that the defendant be discharged from custody on account of said order: It is, therefore,<\/p> <p>\"Ordered by the court, that the motion be sustained and that said order of arrest be, and the same is, vacated and annulled and the defendant discharged from custody, by virtue of said order.<\/p> <p align=\"right\">\"JOHN C.

From this judgment neither of the parties presented an exception.<\/p> <p>On the 5th day of January, 1906, the said Alexander Dragon commenced an action in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila against the defendants herein, Carmen de la Cavada de Enriquez, Francisco Enriquez, and Vicente D. Conde, upon the bond executed in the court of the justice of the peace, given for the arrest and detention of the said Dragon, and prayed for damages in the sum of P5,000.<\/p> <p>On the 2d day of February, 1906, the defendants presented a demurrer to the complaint which was overruled by the court, and on the 27th day of October, 1906, the defendants filed an amended answer in said cause as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"And now come the defendants in the above-entitled cause, jointly and severally by their attorneys, and leave of court having first been had therefor, file this their amended answer to the complaint of the plaintiff and for answer thereto deny each and every one of the allegations in each and every paragraph in said complaint contained; wherefore the defendants pray that they go hence without day, and that they recover their costs herein incurred.<\/p> <p>\"The above-named defendants and each of them, now assuming the position of plaintiffs, in reconvention and cross complaint, for other grounds of relief against the above-named Alexander Dragon, allege:<\/p> <p>\"1. That on the 13th day of October, 1905, in a certain cause entitled Carmen de la Cavada de Enriquez <em>vs<\/em>. Alexander Dragon, in the city of Manila, the above-named defendant Carmen de la Cavada de Enriquez recovered a judgment against the said plaintiff herein, Alexander Dragon, in the sum of P62.40, and for costs, P39.36, in said cause incurred.<\/p> <p>\"2. That the said judgment is still in full force and effect and neither the said judgment nor any part thereof has been paid or satisfied.<\/p> <p>\"3. That the claim of the plaintiff, Alexander Dragon, is upon a bond executed by Carmen de la Cavada de Enriquez, as principal, and the other two defendants herein as sureties.<\/p> <p>\"Wherefore the defendants herein pray that if the said Alexander Dragon be adjudged to recover any sum in this case, the amount of the said judgment, P101.66, above referred to, be allowed and set off against any sum so recovered by the plaintiff, and for such other relief as the court may deem just and proper.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the lower court in its judgment said:<\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>\"The only question here is whether there has been a breach of the conditions of the bond,<\/em> namely, 'that it be definitely declared that the detention of the said defendant, Alexander Dragon, was without lawful cause.'<\/p> <p>\"This court [the Court of First Instance] did so declare, in effect, by the order sustaining the motion to vacate the arrest on the specific grounds already stated, that the affidavit was untrue, and that the present plaintiff did not intend to leave the jurisdiction. (McDaniel <em>vs<\/em>. Gardner, 34 La. Annual, 341; Squire <em>vs<\/em>. McDonald, 21 N. Y. Supplement, 1025.) This issue was therefore squarely presented and decided, and that adjudication could not here be changed even should the evidence warrant.<\/p> <p align=\"center\">*\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0*<\/p> <p>\"The court finds that the arrest of the plaintiff was wrongful and without sufficient cause; that he has been damaged thereby in expense in obtaining his release in the sum of P450 and in other ways to the extent of P100; that these are items of damage in respect to which the defendants have undertaken to indemnify him, and that the judgment recovered by the principal defendant is not a proper counterclaim herein. It is ordered, considered, and adjudged that he recover from the defendants the sum of P550.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>The defendants duly excepted to the above judgment, and after presenting a motion for a new trial, which was duly denied, appealed to this court and presented their bill of exceptions. The defendants and appellants in this court made the following assignments of error:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"1. The trial court erred in finding that the order of arrest in case No. 3743 was vacated 'on the specific grounds already stated, that the affidavit was untrue and that the present plaintiff did not intend to leave the jurisdiction.'<\/p> <p>\"2. The trial court erred in not finding that the order of arrest in case No. 3743 was vacated because the court held 'the same was contrary to law,' in that it was in conflict with the act of Congress of July 1, 1902, providing that 'no person shall be imprisoned for debt.'<\/p> <p>\"3. The trial court erred in finding that the sum of P450, alleged to have been paid by the defendant in case No. 3743, constitutes a part of the damage sustained by reason of the arrest of the defendant in said cause, no actual damage having been shown.<\/p> <p>\"4. The trial court erred in overruling the demurrer of the defendants filed to the complaint in this cause.<\/p> <p>\"5. The trial court, finding no proof of actual damage, erred in awarding P550 punitive or exemplary damages.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>With reference to the first above-noted assignment of error, it will be remembered that the present action is brought upon a bond executed by the defendants herein, in favor of the plaintiff herein, and that the bond provided that the defendants would pay to the plaintiff \"all the damage he may suffer by reason of his detention,\" \"in case it should be definitely declared that the detention of the said Alexander Dragon was without lawful cause.\"<\/p> <p>The question is whether or not it had been finally declared in that cause that the said Alexander Dragon had been arrested without legitimate cause. By reference to the order of the court discharging the defendant, it will be noted that he used the following language:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"That the said order of arrest be, and the same is, vacated and annulled and the defendant discharged from custody.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>The judge in this order fails to give the particular reason for setting aside the order of arrest and discharging the said Dragon. It is to be presumed, however, that the order of arrest was set aside for the reason that the same had been improperly made. This order was final for the reason that no exception or appeal had been taken from it; therefore it was finally determined that the arrest of the said Dragon \"was without lawful cause.\"<\/p> <p>The statement of the judge in his decision in the action upon the bond that the order of arrest had been vacated \"on the specific grounds already stated, that the affidavit (for arrest) was untrue and that the present plaintiff did not intend to leave the jurisdiction,\" was a voluntary statement on the part of the judge, for the reason that there was nothing in the record to show upon what specific grounds the order to vacate the arrest was made but, for the purposes of the action upon the bond, the particular ground upon which the arrest was made is immaterial. It was sufficient for the plaintiff to show in his action upon the said bond that he had been arrested without legitimate cause and had been finally discharged. When the said Dragon brought to the attention of the court, in the proper way, these facts, he had shown sufficient facts to justify the court in holding that the parties to the bond were liable thereon. A bond is a contract, and the persons obligated thereby are liable, where it is shown that there has been a breach thereof, and then the only question left to be decided by the court is as to the amount of damages resulting by reason of such breach.<\/p> <p>What we have said relating to the first assignment of error, in our opinion, also answers the second assignment of error above noted. It is true that the lower court discussed at length the effect of one of the provisions of section 5 of the act of Congress of July 1, 1902, in its relation to section 412 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions. It is true also that one of the provisions of said act of Congress provides that \"no person shall be imprisoned for debt,\" while section 412 of said code provides that persons may be arrested under certain conditions therein named, some of which would indicate, at least, that persons might be arrested for debt. This action, however, was not brought for damages resulting from the arrest of the defendant for debt. It was brought upon a contract (bond) under which the defendants promised to pay to the plaintiff all damages which he, the plaintiff, might suffer under the arrest, if the court should finally decide that the arrest was made without legitimate cause. The lower court did finally decide that the arrest was without legitimate cause, and therefore, under the conditions of the contract (bond), the defendants were liable for whatever damages the plaintiff might show he had suffered by reason of such arrest. In our opinion, in the present action, the question of the effect of the said act of Congress upon the said provisions of said code is not germane, for the reason that the action is upon a contract to pay damages upon conditions named in the contract, and not an action for damages resulting from an arrest made contrary to the provisions of the said act of Congress. The action herein is the same as if the defendants had executed and delivered a bond promising to pay to the plaintiff damages resulting from any other cause. By virtue of the form of the action in the present case, we refuse to discuss the effect which the said act of Congress has upon the said provisions of the said code, believing that the same is not germane to the issue presented here.<\/p> <p>With reference to the third assignment of error above noted, the proof shows by a large preponderance of evidence that the plaintiff, by reason of said arrest without cause, was obliged to pay to his attorney the sum of P450. Under the provisions of the bond we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the defendants obligated themselves to pay this amount, said damages being directly the result of said arrest without cause. We are of the opinion, and so hold, that a reasonable amount paid to an attorney, in cases like the present, may properly be considered in assessing the damages occasioned to the plaintiff. There is nothing in the record which shows that the amount which the plaintiff claims, P450, was an unreasonable amount, and therefore this amount is allowed as a part of the damages suffered by the plaintiff by reason of the said arrest without cause. (Philips <em>vs<\/em>. Bonhan, 16 La. An., 387; Wentz <em>vs<\/em>. Benhardt, 37 La. An., 636; Vanderberg <em>vs<\/em>. Cunnolly, 54 Pacific Rep., 1097.)<\/p> <p>The necessary expense incurred by one who is arrested without cause, in order to secure his release, may be included as damages in an action upon a bond given to secure such arrest, when it is finally determined that the arrest was without just cause.<\/p> <p>With reference to the fourth assignment of error above noted, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the judge of the lower court committed no error in overruling the said demurrer.<\/p> <p>With reference to the fifth assignment of error above noted, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the lower court did not have sufficient evidence before it to justify its judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants for damages in the sum of P100, the sum allowed by the lower court in addition to the amount of P450 adjudged to be due the plaintiff from the defendants as an amount paid by the plaintiff as attorney's fees.<\/p> <p>With this modification, the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, and it is hereby ordered and decreed that the plaintiff recover of the defendants, according to the terms of the said bond, the sum of P450, and costs. So ordered.<\/p> <em>Torres, Willard,<\/em> and <em>Tracey, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/> <br\/> <br\/> <hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/> <p align=\"center\"><em>DISSENTING<\/em><\/p> <p><strong>ARELLANO, C. J.:<\/strong><\/p> <p>This cause has been preceded by another in which a final judgment has already been rendered, and from which the present case is derived.<\/p> <p>The object of the former case was the payment of rentals which Alexander Dragon was to make to Carmen de la Cavada on the 5th of March, 1905, and which he failed to make, and the latter filed her complaint with the court of the justice of the peace of Manila, who sentenced the defendant to pay the rent. Upon said judgment being appealed to the Court of First Instance of Manila, it was affirmed with the costs of both instances against the defendant.<\/p> <p>As a preliminary incident in the previous cause, motion was made asking for the arrest and detention of the defendant for the reason that he had sold out his property and was about to leave the Islands with intent to defraud his creditors, according to the affidavit annexed. On the 25th of March, 1905, the justice of the peace, after the filing of the bond provided for by section 415 of the Code of Civil Procedure, ordered the defendant to be forthwith detained and brought to his court unless bond was furnished for P67.90, the exact amount of rent due, and the costs of the proceedings. The defendant was detained on the same day, the sheriff having had to \"look for the defendant, Dragon, all over the city of Manila, and even searching a vessel which was about to sail from the port of Manila for Hongkong, but without success;\" according to the statement of the defendant's lawyer a motion was also presented to the justice of the peace to set aside the order of arrest. On the 17th following, the justice of the peace entered judgment for the payment of rent and the relief asked for in said motion, stating in respect thereof as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"The motion presented by the defendant asking the annulment of the order of arrest is hereby overruled: * * * (4) because, although the defendant has alleged that he did not intend to leave the Islands and in proof thereof offered two witnesses, as the latter have not testified in a proper manner with respect to the intention of the defendant to absent himself, it is not expedient to annul the order of arrest, especially as the plaintiff herein has presented two witnesses who testified to the contrary, and, further, because this reason was alleged after the bond was furnished.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>While the appeal was being considered by the Court of First Instance the defendant again presented a motion asking that the order of arrest be annulled and set aside, basing his motion upon the allegation that the affidavit offered by the plaintiff was untrue and false, that he had not intended to absent himself from the Islands, and that he had not alienated any of his property except in connection with the requirements of his business, but particularly because \"the issuance of the order of arrest was contrary to the laws of the Philippine Islands for the reason that there is no authority whatever for issuing an order of arrest in connection with debt.\"<\/p> <p>The law of the Philippine Islands alluded to is that of July 1, 1902, section 5 of which provides that \"no person shall be imprisoned for debt.\"<\/p> <p>The Court of First Instance in deciding the motion limited itself to saying: \"The motion is sustained and it is directed that the order of arrest be, and is hereby, canceled and annulled, and that the defendant be discharged from the custody under which he is kept by virtue thereof.\" The plaintiff consented to said decision.<\/p> <p>The same defendant, Dragon, on January 5, 1906, filed the present complaint wherein he claims from Carmen de la Cavada, and from her bondsmen, Francisco Enriquez and Vicente D. Conde, the sum of P5,000, with legal interest thereon, as damages.<\/p> <p>At this date he had not yet paid the rentals, amounting to P101, which he had been sentenced to pay by the Court of First Instance, and the present defendants demanded as a counterclaim the payment thereof.<\/p> <p>The Court of First Instance in final judgment said\u2014<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"That by reason of the detention of the defendant he has been damaged by the expenditure of P450 in obtaining his release, and in other ways to the extent of P100; that these are items of damage in respect to which the defendants have undertaken to indemnify him and that the judgment recovered by the principal defendant is not a proper counterclaim herein.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>And as the reason for thus deciding the question the court stated:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"Upon appeal to this court of the case in which the bond was given, a motion was filed to vacate the order of arrest on the ground that the same was contrary to law, that the affidavit was untrue, and that the affiant never intended to leave the jurisdiction or defraud the creditors. This motion was sustained and the order of arrest vacated * * *. This is a suit <em>ex contractu<\/em> on a bond * * *. The only question here is whether there has been a breach of the condition of the bond, viz, 'that it be finally <em>declared<\/em> that the detention of the defendant, Alexander Dragon, was made without lawful cause.' This court so held as a matter of fact when deciding that the motion to vacate the order of arrest be sustained, basing the same on the specific reasons already stated, that the affidavit was untrue and that the present plaintiff never intended to leave the jurisdiction.\" (B. of E., 8.)<\/p> <p>\"In this order the court\u2014it is so rightly stated in the foregoing majority opinion\u2014does not state the specific reason for vacating the order of arrest and for releasing the said Dragon. It is to be presumed, however, that it was set aside by reason of the same not having been properly issued.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>And this is my reason for dissenting: In the order the court below does not state the specific reasons for vacating the order of arrest; and it can not be assumed that it was set aside because it had not been properly issued.<\/p> <p>When dealing with an action <em>ex contractu,<\/em> the judgment must precisely and clearly specify in what manner the contract was violated.<\/p> <p>Obligations arising from contracts have legal force between the contracting parties, and must be fulfilled in accordance with their stipulations. (Civil Code, art. 1091.) The stipulations of the bond contract were:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"* * * we bind ourselves jointly and severally that, in case it be finally declared that the arrest of the defendant, Alexander Dragon, was made without lawful cause, we will pay the said Alexander Dragon all costs entered in his favor and all damages he may suffer by reason of his detention, provided, however, that the total amount thereof shall not exceed the sum of one thousand pesos, Insular currency.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>In order that the defendants be bound to pay such costs and damages it is by all means necessary that, <em>in accordance with<\/em> their obligation, a final declaration that the detention of the said Alexander Dragon was made without lawful cause be made; while there is no such final declaration, and there is none, the condition of the obligation entered into is not violated. Therefore, no action can arise for the payment of the costs and damages stipulated in the contract.<\/p> <p>The specific reason for the ruling vacating the order of arrest may have been that, it being an action for debt, the judge considered that it was contrary to the Philippine bill of July 1, 1902, and probably for the same reason the annulment was consented to by the plaintiff in that action. In such a case no action for damages could arise therefrom because it was not included within the conditions of the contract. This fact may be assumed as well as the other.<\/p> <p>If a doctrine is established that whenever a motion is sustained and a previous ruling, order, or decision is vacated, the court accepts and acknowledges all the reasons contained in the motion, I do not conform to such a doctrine inasmuch as the reasons may be many, and subordinate or in the alternative, or even contradictory, and it is not conceivable how they can all be accepted under a general form of \"the motion is sustained and the previous ruling, order, or decision is revoked.\" An example of the foregoing is the motion for new trial authorized by section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which may be based upon accident or surprise, newly discovered evidence, excessive damages, insufficient evidence, and that the decision was contrary to law, all of which grounds may be embodied in the motion, and a decision which, after considering the motion, only stated that\u2014\"Upon new trial had by virtue of the motion filed therefor, the court orders that the former judgment be, and the same is hereby, reversed,\"\u2014it could not, in such a case, in my opinion, be assumed that the order included all the aforesaid grounds.<\/p> <p>Therefore, I consider that the court has committed the first error alleged by the appellants in declaring that the order of arrest was vacated \"for the specific reasons already set forth, that the affidavit was untrue, and that the present plaintiff did not intend to leave the jurisdiction.\" And said error is further evidenced in the majority opinion in which it is said that: \"The statement of the judge in his decision in the action upon the bond that the order of arrest had been vacated 'on the specific grounds already stated, that the affidavit (for arrest) was untrue and that the present plaintiff did not intend to leave this jurisdiction,' was a voluntary statement on the part of the judge, for the reason that there was nothing in the record to show upon what specific grounds the order to vacate the arrest was made.\"<\/p><\/div>",

de la acusaci\u00f3n, en 25 Abril de 1906 en la casa municipal del pueble de Siatong de que era Presidente  la saz\u00f3n el aqui acusado.\u00a0 Y lo fueron con un baston del tama\u00f1o de una mu\u00f1eca, con el cual dio el acusado con toda fuerza unos cuarenta golpes en el pecho y la espalda al ofendido que fu\u00e9 derribado al sueldo por la violencia de los golpes echando alli mismo sangre por la boca en cantidad de una taza.\u00a0 De resultes de aquellos golpes qued\u00f3 el ofendido completamente invlido, imposibilitado para toda clase de trabajo, a\u00fan para bajar de casa por falta de fuerzas, y reducido  estan constantemente acostado sintiendo intensos dolores en el pecho y la espalda que le impedian hacer el menor esfuerzo, hasta que fallecio en Diciembre del mismo a\u00f1o 1906, siendo asi que estaba grueso, fuerte y sano antes de recibir lis golpes.\u00a0 (Declaraciones de Venancio Hayoma Calixto Ragot y Nicolasa Adon).\u00a0 Esta \u00faltima testigo, concubina del ofendido, dice adems que qued\u00f3 \u00e9sta tan debil  consecuencia de aquellos golpes que tenia que ayudarle para levantares de la cama \u00e9 ir  las letrinas, y que desde que fu\u00e9 maltratado por el acusado hasta que muri\u00f3, no dej\u00f3 de echar sangre por la boca ni un solo dia, haciendolo tres veces de dia y dos veces de noche.\u00a0 Los mencionados testigos afirman categ\u00f3ricamente que la muerte del ofendido fu\u00e9 producida por los malos tratos del acusado.<br\/><br\/>Dos de dichos tres testigos, Venancio Hayoma y Calixta Ragot, fueron presenciales, seg\u00fan ellos mismos, de dichos malos-tratos.\u00a0 Y fueron tambien maltratados por el acusado, el Venancia por querer acudir  su hermano Rosenda, el aqui ofendido, al verle echar sangre por la boca; y el Calixto al tratar de acudir  su vez  Venancio y Rosendo, recihiendo ambos, (Venancio y Calixto) mas de veinte golpes cada uno dados por el acusado con toda fuerza con aquel baston, grueso como la mu\u00f1eca de la mano.\u00a0 Otra testigo hay adems, llamada Timotea Raga, que asevera haber visto aquellos malostratos desde una casa vecina  la del municipio.<br\/><br\/>La primera querella en esta causa fu\u00e9 presentada con fecha 26 de Septiembre de 1906, \u00f3 sea cinco meses despues de ocurrido ek suceso de autos.\u00a0 Hasta entonces no se di\u00f3 cuenta del hecho  ninguna autotidad.\u00a0 El testigo Venancio Hayoma trat\u00f3 de explicar esta larga demora diciendo que no se habia denunciado el hecho porque <u>los policias que lo han visto son testigos de Felipe<\/u> (el acusado).\u00a0 Y sin embargo el mismo dice en su declaraci\u00f3n que ning\u00fan policia presenci\u00f3 el suceso porque el procesado habia tomado la pre-cauci\u00f3n de hacer bajar  todos los policias y otras personas que habia en la casa municipal antes de maltratarles.\u00a0 Otro hecho que no se explica en la causa es el siguiente: aquella primera querella fu\u00e9 enmendada con fecha 12 de Febrero de 1907, ocurrida ya la muerte de Rosenda Hayoma que falleci\u00f3 en Diciembre anterior.\u00a0 Si como afirman los testigos de la acusaci\u00f3n, Rosendo muri\u00f3 de resultas de los malostratos inferidos al mismo por el procesado, parecia l\u00f3gico que al enmendarse la querella se hubiese acusado  \u00e9ste del delito de homicido en lugar del de lesiones graves solament.<br\/><br\/>Resulta tambien que el Juzgado conden\u00f3 al procesado, no por el delito de lesiones graves acusado en la querella, sino por el de lesiones menos graves, apreciando que \u00e9stas le produjeron al ofendido inutilidad para el trabajo por mas de ocho dias y no ms de treinta,  pesar de la categ\u00f3rica afirmaci\u00f3n de los testigos de cargo de que aquella inutilidad dur\u00f3 cinco meses, \u00f3 sea hasta el mes de Diciembre en que falleci\u00f3 dicho ofendido.<br\/><br\/>A juzgar por los anteriores detalles parece que ni el Juzgado ni el Fiscal mismo que dirigi\u00f3 la acusaci\u00f3n han dado entero cr\u00e9dito  todo lo declarado por los testigos de cargo.<br\/><br\/>Tantas y tales son en efecto las contradicciones en que esos testigos han incurrido, que tiene que resultar necesariamente muy sospechoso su testimonio.<br\/><br\/>Y su contradiccion empieza desde el principio mismo de sus declaraciones al referir el motivo de los malostratos que se imputan al acusado.\u00a0 Venancio Hayoma dice que lo fu\u00e9 el no querer el ofendido Rosendo continuar trabajando como aparcero del acusado, por no estar conforme con las nuevas condiciones de la aparceria impuestas por \u00e9ste \u00faltimo, y Calixto Ragot dice textualmente por su parte que <u>el motivo del castigo procedia de mi terreno que me lo queria quitar Santiago Tayco<\/u>.\u00a0 Luego relata el Venancia el comienzo del suceso diciendo que alcentrar \u00e9l y sus dos compa\u00f1eros en el despacho del acusado, mand\u00f3 \u00e9ste bajar  los policias y les pidi\u00f3  ellos las c\u00e9dulas.\u00a0 \"Al acabar de leer las cedulas, a\u00f1ade, \"nos dijo Tayco que <u>nos sentramos<\/u>, y <u>despues de pocos minutos de sentados<\/u>, cogi\u00f3 un baston y nos peg\u00f3,\"\u00a0 El Ragot declara sobre esto de modo my differnte, pues dice que al llegar ellos  dicho despacho, <u>en seguida, inmediatamente, sin intervalo alguno de momento<\/u> les peg\u00f3 el acusado estando ellos de pi\u00e9.\u00a0 Ambos testigos dicen que \u00e9ste les peg\u00f3 con el baston unas veintes veces  cada uno u unas cuarenta al ofendido Rosendo, mientras que seg\u00fan Timotea Raga, la testigo que dice haber presenciado desde una casa vecina los malostratos, no di\u00f3 el acusado ms que un golpe con el baston  cada unp de los tres.\u00a0 Y cuenta que esta testigo asegur\u00f3 varias veces en su declaraci\u00f3n haber visto el <u>primer<\/u> palo dado por el acusado, que lo fu\u00e9, seg\u00fan ella, sobre la espalda de Rosendo.\u00a0 Habiendo llegado la testigo  tiempo de poder ver el primer palo, no hay motivo para career que hubiese dejado de ver los dems palos que sucedieron  aquel, muy numerosos por cierto seg\u00fan los dos anteriores testigos, de haberlos habido realmente, toda vez que ella se par\u00f3 en el sitio donde se encontraba precisamente para ver y observar lo que ocurr\u00eda dentro del municipio.\u00a0 Se contradicen tambien en cuanto  la clase de baston usado por el acusado que seg\u00fan afirmaci\u00f3n categ\u00f3rica \u00e9 insistente de Ragot que asegura haberse fijado bien en ello, era de madera, y no de bejuco; mientras que al decir de Venancio Hayoma y Timotea Raga era de bejuco, a\u00f1adiendo esta ulitma que se veian clara y distintamente los gajos \u00f3 nudas del bejuco desde la casa donde ella se halla ba, distante unas diez brazas de la casa del municipio.<br\/><br\/>Se pueden citar todav\u00eda otras varias contradicciones de importancia de estos testigos, entre ellas las siguientes: Venancio Hayoma declara que al recibir el sexto golpe del acusado se cay\u00f3 \u00e9l al suelo perdiendo el conocimiento hasta que fu\u00e9 auxiliado por Ragot, el cual le desmiente rotundamente por cuanto dice que no se cayo aquel ni una sola vez al suelo, ni por tanto, como as consiguiente, perdi\u00f3 el conocimiento durante el suceso de autos.\u00a0 Pro su parte el Ragot asevera que los palos que le di\u00f3 el acusado le fracturaron una costilla, al paso que seg\u00fan Venancio Hayoma, ni \u00e9l, ni Rosendo ni Ragot sufrieron fractura alguna de hueso con motivo de aquellos palos.\u00a0 El mismo Venancio Hayoma dice que el aqui ofendido Rosendo qued\u00f3 en tan mal estado despu\u00e9s de los malostratos que, para regresar  su casa, tuvo que ir <u>en brazos de Calixto Ragot y sostenido por \u00e9ste<\/u>, mientras que Ragot declara que al salir los tres del municipio se fueron separadamente cada uno  sus respectivas casas, de lo que se deduce que no acompa\u00f1o, ni menos llev\u00f3 en bravos  su casa  Rosendo.\u00a0 Despr\u00e9ndese esto mismo de la declaraci\u00f3n de Nicolasa Adon, concubina de este, por cuanto dice que Rosendo lleg\u00f3  su casa solo, despu\u00e9s del suceso.\u00a0 Esa misma Nicolasa Adon declara que al subir Rosendo  su casa cay\u00f3se inmediatemente al suelo y desde entonces no ha vuelto  bajar de casa por falta de fuerza hasta que muri\u00f3, extremo este \u00faltimo que ha sido igualmente aseverado por Venancio Hayoma, Pues bien, contradiciendo terminantemente  estos dos testigos dice la otra testigo de la acusaci\u00f3n, Timotea Raga, que como  las tres de la tarde del dia del suceso, \u00f3 sea tres horas despu\u00e9s de ocurrido este, estuvo en su casa el Rosendo para decirle que no podia seguir curando  su hijo porque le dolia el cuerpo.\u00a0 Por lo dems, es evidente que la supuesta debilidad de Rosendo no seria tan grande ni tan extremada que tuvieran que ayudarle a\u00fan para levantarse de la cama como lo afirman Venancio Hayoma, Calixto Ragot y Nicolasa Adon, puesto que segun esta misma y Timotea Raga, pudo trasladarse y de hecho se traslad\u00f3 <u> caballo<\/u> desde el barrio de Cambalansan donde viv\u00eda hasta el barrio de Caballan donde falleci\u00f3, siendo este barrio muy distante al decir de la Raga.<br\/><br\/>Hay adems un detalle de importancia que da la medida de la poca credibilidad de los testigos Venancio Hayoma y Calixto Ragot Estos testigos prestaron declaraci\u00f3n en el juicio  mediados de Febrero de 1907, es decir, diez meses despu\u00e9s de inferidos los malostratos que atribuyen al acusado, y declararon que hasta entonces sentian dolores en el cuerpo producidos por aquellos malostratos, El Ragot dijo ademas que segu\u00eda curndose todav\u00eda de la fractura de la costilla que no se hallaba aun curada del todo.\u00a0 Pues bien, estos testigos,  requirimiento del Fiscal, fueron reconocidos por el Medico Don Vicente Locsin, Presidente Municipal de sanidad de Dumaguete, en Septiembre de 1906, seis meses antes de la declaracion de los mismos, y ese M\u00e9dico certific\u00f3 entonces al Fiscal y declar\u00f3 despu\u00e9s en el juicio, que no habia encontrado ninguna lesi\u00f3n, ni fractura, ni siquiera vestigios de una ni otra cosa en el cuerpo de dichos testigos.<br\/><br\/>Por otra parte el acusado declar\u00f3 que el dia 25 de Abril de 1906 no estuvieron Rosendo Hayoma ni Calixto Ragot en la casa municipal, habiendo estado solo Venancio Hayoma  quien habia mandado llamar por poseer una lanza con la que amenezaba  sus convecinos del barrio segun denuncia que habia recibido de \u00e9stos.\u00a0 Este \u00faltimo hecho, aunque negado por el Venancio, ha resultado suficientemente probado con la comunicaci\u00f3n que obraba en el Gobierno de la provincia (exhibit A de la defansa) dirigida por el acusado, como presidente Municipal de su pueblo, con fecha 26 de Abril de 1906 dando parte de la capture de una lanza en poder de dicho Venancia verificada el dia anterior, \u00f3 sea en la fecha de autos justamente.\u00a0 Varios testigos confirman lo dalcarado por el acusado respecto  no haber estado Rosendo Hayoma y Calixto Ragot, y si solo el Venancio en la casa municipal en aquella fecha, y declaran adems que el acusado no maltrat\u00f3  \u00e9ste ni  ninguna otra persona en aquella ocasi\u00f3n.<br\/><br\/>En cuanto al supuesto ofendido Venancio Hayoma que se dice haber estado constantemente postrado en cama desde que fue maltratado hasta que fallecio, hay varios testigos que afirman haberle visto varias veces en la plaza y en la gallera en los meses de Mayo, Junio, Julio y Agosto de 1906; y el mediquillo que le asisti\u00f3 por el me de Octubre en la enfermedad de que muri\u00f3, asevera que dicha enfermedad era tisis y que la venia padeciendo el Rosendo de hacia unos dos a\u00f1os.\u00a0 Este testigo declara tambien que nunca le dijo aquel que su enfermedad tuviese por causa algun maltrato inferido por el acusado.<br\/><br\/>En vista de estas pruebas y de las muchas y manifiestas contradicciones de los testigos de la acusaci\u00f3n, no podemos dar por probado fuera de toda duda racional el hecho, ya harto extraordinario en si, de que tres hombres j\u00f3venes de 20 y 30 a\u00f1os, como lo son Venancio Hayoma y Calixto Ragot,  solas con el acusado, se hubiesen dejado pegar por este tantas y tantas veces hasta el punto de echar sangre por la boca una de ellos, de perder el conocimiento el otro y de fracturarsele una costilla al tercero, recibiendo palo tras palo con los brazos cruzados (asi lo dicen del ofendido Rosendo) tan resignada y pacientemente que no hayan tratado siquiera de esquivar de algun modo los golpes, \u00f3 por lo menos de huir de tan grave y brutal agresion, ya que no resistirla por el alegado respeto \/autoridad que aquel ejercia.<br\/><br\/>En su virtud y con revocaci\u00f3n de la sentencia apelada, absolvemos libremente al acusado con las costas de ambas instancias de officio.\u00a0 Transcurridos diez dias desde la notification de esta decisi\u00f3n, dectese sentencia a tenor de lo resuelto, y diez dias despues devu\u00e9lvase la cause al Juzgado de su procedencia  los efectos  que en derecho hubiere lugar.<br\/><br\/>Asi se ordena.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.J., Gomez, Carson<\/i> and <i>Willard.<\/i><\/div><br\/><br\/><\/div>",

From that judgment the plaintiff has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The answer and counterclaim in this case are substantially the same as\u00a0 the answer\u00a0 and\u00a0 counterclaim in\u00a0 case No. 3471.\u00a0 In the decision in that case which is filed herewith we have considered and disposed of such defenses, and we hold in this case as we did in the other case, that the evidence is not sufficient to establish any of the defenses or the counterclaim.<br\/><br\/>That the defendant Martinez, at the time the action was commenced, was indebted to the plaintiff in at least the sum of P159,607.81 was fully established by the evidence. It remains, therefore, to consider only the nature of the contract upon which this action was brought.\u00a0 That contract is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"I, Don Francisco Martinez y Garcia, resident of\u00a0 Manila, Province of Manila, Philippine Islands, of age, married, merchant, to all whom these presents may concern, cause to appear:<br\/><br\/>\"That whereas I have received and am debtor at the present time to the International Banking Corporation for the amount of different loans or advances which the said bank has granted to me, with interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum, to wit:\u00a0 The promissory notes which\u00a0 I have executed on certain\u00a0 dates and which\u00a0 are now in the possession of the bank, amounting to\u00a0 the sum of one hundred\u00a0 and ten thousand pesos, Mexican currency ($110,000); a loan of thirty thousand pesos ($30,000), secured by the steamers <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Don Francisco<\/span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Gernana<\/span>; the amount of a mortgage on the houses in corner of Calles Barcelona and Jaboneros, and in corner of Calles Elcano and Caballeros, both in the barrio of Binondo, within the judicial district of same\u00a0 name, in the sum of thirteen thousand dollars, United States currency, which sum the bank has paid to the company 'El Varadero de Manila' and the sum of nine thousand ($9,000),\u00a0 the amount covered by public instrument No. 814, of November 20, 1902.<br\/><br\/>\"I have agreed with the said International Banking Corporation, for the payment of said obligations, and in order to expedite the partition of the property of the conjugal partnership of Martinez Ilustre, with my son, Don Pedro Martinez, to the following:<br\/><br\/>\"First. I bind myself to sell, with right of repurchase, to the International Banking Corporation, all the houses which have been adjudicated to me in said partition, the list of which is the following:<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"Second. The bank, on its part, binds itself to sell absolutely to my son, Don Pedro Martinez, all the houses, half of which was previously sold and mortgaged\u00a0 as my own property, and to cancel the encumbrances thereon, and which it is my duty to extinguish, delivering them free of such encumbrances to my son, Don Pedro Martinez;<br\/><br\/>\"Third. I also bind myself to sell to the said bank the steamer <i>Germana<\/i>, releasing the security previously\u00a0 given to the bank upon the half of the steamer <i>Don Francisco<\/i> which, in her turn, shall be completely released and delivered by the bank to my son, Don Pedro Martinez;<br\/><br\/>\"Fourth. I also bind myself to sell to the bank my interest in the properties situated in the pueblo of Balayan, Province of Batangas, and belonging to the conjugal partnership of\u00a0 Martinez\u00a0 Ilustre, up to the full satisfaction of the liabilities which I have or may have contracted with said bank,\u00a0 and to this end I authorize the hank to intervene in my name in the said\u00a0 partition and to carry out the same extrajudicially with my said son, Pedro Martinez, in\u00a0 a just and\u00a0 equitable manner, including therein whatever money, rights, assets, or shares belonging to me, which sale shall be understobd to be for the price that may result from the partition;<br\/><br\/>\"Fifth. The International I Bank binds itself to place in current account at my disposal any balance of money which may stand\u00a0 to my credit out of the\u00a0 foregoing obligations, according to the sale prices as agreed upon, or as may be agreed upon for said sales, all of which shall be carried out with the right of repurchase within the period of six months;<br\/><br\/>\"Sixth. For the effects of the repurchase, the bank binds itself to accept, at its\u00a0 maturity, the sum of 4,000 pesos monthly, with which I shall gradually refund the purchase price of said sales during\u00a0 the term stipulated for said repurchase, or during the extensions granted in\u00a0 their respective cases;<br\/><br\/>\"Seventh. The bank shall place at my disposal in current account, the balance of the amounts of said sales, as soon as the titles have been delivered to the bank and properly registered, but not before;<br\/><br\/>\"Eighth. It shall be the duty of the bank to extend every six months the term for the repurchase granted\u00a0 in each case, should the monthly installments of 4,000 pesos, agreed upon, be faithfully paid by me, in order to refund and satisfy the amounts of the same;<br\/><br\/>\"Ninth. For the effects of the above-mentioned payment, I hereby transfer and convey to the bank\u00a0 the\u00a0 right of usufruct which I possess on the third\u00a0 part corresponding to the property assigned to my son,\u00a0 the whole amount of which will be devoted to the payment of said obligation;<br\/><br\/>\"Tenth. If for any reason I should not make the monthly payments of 4,000 pesos, and on that account, at maturity of the repurchase, the same should be held to have expired, and without the right of an extension, to which I would otherwise be entitled, the bank shall refund in case, the sale be perfected, the partial payment received;<br\/><br\/>\"Eleventh. I bind myself to execute the deeds of cancellation, transfer, adjudication, and as many as may\u00a0 be necessary, to comply with and carry into effect what has been above stated and\u00a0 agreed to.\"<\/blockquote>It appears from the evidence presented by the defendants that on the 15th day of June, 1903, when this document was executed, the bank already had acquired an interest in almost all the property described therein.\u00a0 At the time it acquired such interest, the defendant Martinez owned one half thereof, and his son, Pedro, the other\u00a0 half.\u00a0 On the 13th of June, 1903, Francisco Martinez and his son agreed upon a division of the property, which partition was approved by the Court of First Instance of Manila.\u00a0 It is evident that this document was executed for the purpose, among others, of making the claim which the bank had\u00a0 to an undivided half of the\u00a0 property of Francisco\u00a0 Martinez, a claim upon all the property which fell to Francisco Martinez in the partition.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff considered that the document was in effect a mortgage upon the\u00a0 real estate described therein, and asked\u00a0 to have such real estate sold to satisfy the debts secured thereby; that is, the amount due the\u00a0 bank aforesaid.\u00a0 We do not agree with this construction of the instrument.\u00a0 That it is not\u00a0 a mortgage is very clear.\u00a0 It is a promise to1 sell real estate upon certain terms, and contemplates a subsequent\u00a0 contract of\u00a0 sale which\u00a0 should contain the terms stated in this document.\u00a0 It was evidently intended that whenever that final contract of sale was made it should contain a clause giving to Francisco Martinez the right to repurchase the property within six months, not from the date of the document in question that is to say, the 15th of June, 1903-but from the date when the final contract of sale with the right to repurchase was executed, and the obligation on the part of Martinez to pay 4,000 a month did not arise on the 15th day of June, 1903, but it was intended that it should arise whenever the final contract of sale with\u00a0 the right of repurchase was made.\u00a0 That this was\u00a0 the understanding of the bank is clearly shown, as claimed by the defendants, in the document of the 12th of February, 1904, which was executed by the plaintiff and by the defendant Francisco Martinez. That document was\u00a0 void because at that time Francisco Martinez was under guardianship,\u00a0 but\u00a0 it clearly indicates the view which the bank had of the nature of the contract of the 15th of June, 1903.\u00a0 To our\u00a0 minds, it states substantially the real obligations which\u00a0 Martinez incurred by this contract,\u00a0 obligations which he can now through his guardian be compelled to perform.\u00a0 The fact that the plaintiff has taken an erroneous view of the nature of this contract can not deprive it of the right to such relief as the facts proven show it\u00a0 is entitled to.\u00a0 The contract is set out in the complaint and it is not suggested that that complaint does not contain facts sufficient to constitute a good cause of action for the specific performance of the contract, except that it is claimed that such complaint is deficient because there is no allegation of any demand on Martinez for the execution of the contract of sale.\u00a0 Being under guardianship, it is apparent that a demand\u00a0 would have been\u00a0 unavailing.\u00a0 No\u00a0 demand was therefore necessary. The fact that the plaintiff did not specifically ask for the relief to which we hold it is entitled rs not material.\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec. 126, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>Of the debt set out in the complaint in this case, no part thereof has been paid, but the evidence shows that the plaintiff has been in possession of certain real property described in the complaint and has received rent therefor.<br\/><br\/>We do not understand that it was admitted at the trial that the plaintiff took possession of this property after the guardian was appointed.\u00a0 There is evidence tending to show that such possession\u00a0 was taken before that date. The net amount collected should be applied in\u00a0 reduction of the sum of P159,607.81 which, according to the evidence, the defendants owe to the plaintiff.\u00a0 When the case is remanded, the defendant should have an opportunity\u00a0 to question\u00a0 the expenses claimed to have been met by the plaintiff in connection with its possession of these buildings, which it has deducted from the gross amount received.<br\/><br\/>After a consideration of the whole case, we hold that the plaintiff is entitled to a judgment in the court below, with costs, declaring that Francisco Martinez is justly indebted to it in the sum of P159,007.81 less such sum as that court may decide should be credited\u00a0 to Martinez\u00a0 for the\u00a0 net receipts from the real estate in question in this case, with interest on the\u00a0 balance from February 25, 1905, at 8 per cent\u00a0 per annum; and ordering that Francisco Martinez, and Vicente Ilustre as\u00a0 guardian of Francisco Martinez, execute and deliver to the plaintiff, within a time to be fixed\u00a0 by the court, such a contract as is contemplated by the contract of June 15, 1903, which should be substantially in the form of the instrument above referred to of date\u00a0 February 12, 1904, omitting therefrom, however, the steamer Germana.\u00a0 The judgment should contain a provision\u00a0 that whatever may be realized from the sale of the <i>Germana<\/i> under the judgment in case No. 3471 shall be considered as a partial payment when realized upon the amount found due in this action.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions\u00a0 to that court\u00a0 to enter judgment for the plaintiff in accordance\u00a0 with the views hereinbefore expressed.\u00a0\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in this court\u00a0 So ordered.,<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.J., Torres, Mapa,\u00a0 Carson,<\/i> and <i> Tracey, JJ.<\/i>, concur. <\/div>",

The marks in question in the case at bar are the following:<br\/><br\/><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr valign=\"top\"> <td width=\"7%\"><div align=\"center\"><\/div><\/td> <td width=\"7%\"><div align=\"center\"><\/div><\/td> <td><div align=\"center\">B.<\/div><\/td> <td><div align=\"center\">B.<\/div><\/td> <td width=\"72%\">\u00a0<\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><div align=\"center\">G.H.<\/div><\/td> <td><div align=\"center\">R.C.<\/div><\/td> <td width=\"7%\"><div align=\"center\">G.H.<\/div><\/td> <td width=\"7%\"><div align=\"center\">G.H.<\/div><\/td> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><div align=\"center\">L.<\/div><\/td> <td><div align=\"center\">C.<\/div><\/td> <td><div align=\"center\">L.<\/div><\/td> <td><div align=\"center\">T.<\/div><\/td> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table><br\/><br\/>The evidence clearly established the contention of the defendant that these marks and other marks indicate the quality of hemp which is contained in the bales. It also clearly supports the other contention of the defendant that the hemp is as a general rule sold in Manila by the marks upon the bales and that when buyers purchase bales with certain marks thereon they expect to find therein hemp of a certain quality.<br\/><br\/>the evidence, moreover, shows that hemp is also classified in Manila in another way and that there are known to the trade several current\", \"midway\", \"fair current: and others; and that sales can be and are made with reference to these grades without considering the marks at all.<br\/><br\/>Whether the hemp is sold by the marks or by the grades above-mentioned, the buyer always has the right to inspect it for the purpose of seeing if the quality of the hemp corresponds to that indicated by the mark, when the sale is made with reference to the mark, or if it is sold with reference to one of the other grades such as \"fair current\", to see if it is equal to that grade.<br\/><br\/>It seems that the quality of the hemp indicated by the mark is or may be reduced to the grades above-mentioned, as for example, the mark \"G.H.\" is supposed to<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 L.<br\/><br\/>grade as, or somewhat above \"midway\".

The dispute between them is as to whether the hemp which was sold was to be \"good current Manila\" as claimed by the plaintiff or whether it was to be of the quality indicated by the four marks above-mentioned. It was not claimed by the defendant below, and is not claimed here by it, that the hemp indicated by those marks is equal to the grade \"good current\".<br\/><br\/>The contract was a verbal one and was made in the office of the plaintiff, between Mr. Knight, its representative, and Don Leopoldo Criado, the representative of the defendant. Mr. Knight testified that he bought, and Don Leopoldo Criado agreed to sell him, 500 bales of \"good current Manila\" hemp. That while some mentioned of marks was made, he said he could not accept those marks unless they turned out to be up to the quality of \"good current Manila\". Don Leopoldo Criado testified that the phrase \"good current\" was never mentioned in the conversation; that he stated to Mr. Knight that the defendant had 554 bales of the four marks mentioned, and that of those he sold 500 bales. The testimony of Mr. Knight is corroborated by the testimony of Mr. Higginbotham, who was his assistant in the office who heard the conversation, and who states that there was a positive agreement on the part of Don Leopoldo Criado to furnish 500 bales of \"good current Manila\". These three witnesses are the only ones who testified as to what the contract. was.<br\/><br\/>There is other evidence in the case, however, which in our opinion, and in the opinion of the court below, corroborates the testimony for the plaintiff. On the 13th of September, 1906, the plaintiff received from the Portland Cordage Company of Oragon a telegram asking the plaintiff to make them an offer for 500 bales of good current Leyte hemp by the September or October steamer. On the same day the plaintiff telegraphed the Portland Cordage Company that they could not furnish Leyte hemp but they offered 500 bales of \"good current Manila\" hemp for the September or October steamer, at the price of 45 pounds. Mr. Knight testified that before sending this telegram he saw Don Leopoldo Criado and that the letter told him that they could furnish 500 bales of \"good current Manila\" hemp at 24 pesos a picul and that relying upon such information he made this offer. On the 17th day of September, the plaintiff received a telegram from the Portland Cordage Company accepting its offer of 500 bales of \"good current Manila\" hemp. Don Leopoldo Criado denies that he ever had any conversation with Mr. Knight in regard to this ever had any conversation with Mr. Knight in regard to this matter on the 13th of September, but the fact that these telegrams were sent and received was undisputed. Both Mr. Knight and Mr. Higginbotham testified that when the contract was closed on the 17th day of September the telegram of acceptance had just been received from Portland and was shown to Don Leopoldo Criado. The latter denies this and says that he never saw the telegram until sometime after.<br\/><br\/>Other evidence corroborative of the claim of the plaintiff is found in a letter writtne by Higginbotham to Knight on the 19th day of September, two days after the making of the contract. Higginbotham and Don Leopoldo Criado inspected two bales of each of the four marks upon the 18th, Mr. Knight being then sick and away from his office. He also was absent therefrom on the 19th. In this letter Higginbotham says: \"In reference to Gutierrez' hemp which I inspected yesterday morning, I saw the following marks which I make (here follows a statement of the condition of hemp found in each bale.) I saw two bales of each mark. I do not consider it is a fair tender against \"Manila good current\". I have had the bales separated in our bodega so as you can look at same when fit again. Leopoldo does not agree to above classification but says that he will wait to see you.\" Higginbotham at the trial testified to the same effect. That higginbotham understood on the 19th of September that the plaintiff had bought good current Manila hemp is proven by this letter. If he thought so on the 19th, he must have thought so on the 17th, when the contract which he was a witness was made.<br\/><br\/>The court below found upon the facts in favor of the plaintiff and we think that the evidence sustains such finding.<br\/><br\/>Of the 500 bales delivered, the plaintiff accepted and paid for 201 bales and no question as to these bales is made in this case. It refused to accept 299 bales on the ground that it was not good current Manila hemp, called upon the defendant to furnish 299 bales of that quality and notified it that on failure to do so it would buy the same in the market and charge the increased cost to the defendant. The defendant refused to substitute other bales and the plaintiff bought 299 of good current Manila hempt at 28.50 pesos a picul, 4.50 pesos more per picul than the price at which the defendant had agreed to furnish them that quality of hemp. The loss to the plaintiff was therefore 2691 pesos and to recover that sum this action was brought.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below in favor of the plaintiff for that amount, is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the defendant. <br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"CENTER\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">DISSENT<\/span><br\/><\/div><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CARSON, J.:<\/span><br\/><br\/>As I understand it, we are all agreed that the evidence of record clearly establishes the contention of the defendant that it is the custom of hemp dealers in Manila, to buy and sell hemp in accordance with certain well known and standard \"letter marks,\" reserving always, and of course, the right to examine the hemp furnished to see that it comes up to the classification represented by these marks.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiffs allege that in making the particular purchase in question, they contracted for the delivery of hemp of a standard of classification known as \"good current, Manila\" and not for hemp of the quality indicated by the \"letter marks\" as furnished by the defendants.<br\/><br\/>I do not think that the evidence of record in support of plaintiffs' allegations is sufficient to rebut the testimony of the witnesses of the defendant, supported as it is by the presumption, that unless it clearly, definitely and positively appears that there was a contrary stipulation, the sale on this occasion was made in accordance with the customary and usual practice of hemp merchants in similar transactions in the same market.<br\/><br\/>I take it that the plaintiffs intended and desired to purchase \"good current, Manila\", and that when they contracted with plaintiffs they believed that the marks under consideration indicated a quality of hemp which would serve as a good tender on a demand for such hemp, but I do not think that it affirmatively appears that there was an agreement, a meeting of minds, whereby it was understood that on this particular occasion the usual and customary method adopted by hemp merchants in Manila in buying and selling hemp should be set aside, the defendant assuming the unusual risk of guaranteeing not only that the hemp delivered would come up to the local \"letter mark\" standard but also to the export \"good current\" standard. I do not find a particle of evidence tending to prove that there was any special reason or inducement for the defendants' undertaking this special risk on this occasion, and I do not think that they ever intended or agreed to do so. <\/div><\/div>",

that he was married about six months previously to Maria Teresa Ponce de Leon, and that he had no lawful descendants; the testator, however, stated in clause three of his will, that in case he had a\u00a0 duly\u00a0 registered successor, his child would be his sole and universal\u00a0 heir; but that if, as Avould probably be the case, there should be no such heir, then in clause four he named his said father Francisco Escuin, and his wife Maria Teresa Ponce de Leon his universal heirs, they to divide the\u00a0 estate in equal shares between them.<br\/><br\/>The testator died on the 20th of January, 1899, as certified to by the municipal court of Magdalena, Sevilla, on the 20th Of March, 1900.<br\/><br\/>Upon the will having been admitted to probate,\u00a0 commissioners were appointed to consider\u00a0 claims against the estate, and, according to a report presented to the Court of First Instance on the 20th of June, 1907, one claim was allowed amounting to 3,696.50 pesetas.<br\/><br\/>On the 10th and 12th of July, 1907, the attorney for the widow, Ponce de Leon, and the attorneys who represented the guardian of the minor, Emilio Escuin y Batac, appealed to the Court of First Instance from the findings of the aforesaid commissioners.<br\/><br\/>Matters\u00a0 stood thus, and without there appearing any decision of the court as to the appeals, the attorney for the administrator, by a writing1 dated\u00a0 the 3d of September, following, moved for the approval of the\u00a0 proposed partition of the estate provided for by the court; by the first additional request (<i>otrosi<\/i>) he asked\u00a0 that the remuneration for the services of the administrator of the estate be fixed, and that he be authorized to draw\u00a0 such amount from\u00a0 the funds of the estate;

that Francisco\u00a0 Escuin, the father of the testator, his wife or widow, Teresa Ponce de Leon, and his natural child, the minor Emilio Escuin y Batac, represented by his mother and guardian Julia Batac, are entitled to the succession; that, by setting aside one-third of the estate in favor of the natural son,\u00a0 recognized in accordance with article 842 of the Civil Code, there only\u00a0 remains the question as to how the remaining two-thirds\u00a0 of the inheritance shall be bestowed, taking into\u00a0 account the directions of the testator in his will; that the same does not disclose that he had left any child by his wife; that the latter, as the Widow of the testator, besides being a designated heir entitled to one-half of the hereditary funds, is entitled to the usufruct of the portion fixed by the law, and that the funds to be apportioned are composed\u00a0 wholly of cash or ready money.<br\/><br\/>On these grounds the partition and adjudication was proceeded with of the sum of P5,014.81 into three shares of P1,671.60 to each one of the parties in interest, that is, the natural son, Emilio Escuin y Batac, in full control as general heir;\u00a0 the\u00a0 widow, Teresa\u00a0 Ponce de Leon, as legatee of one-half of the two-thirds of the funds of free disposition; and the said widow the usufruct of the other half\u00a0 of the aforesaid two-thirds of free disposition, the bare\u00a0 ownership of the last third held in usufruct by the widow being adjudicated to Francisco Escuin, as legatee taking into account the provisions of article 817 of the Civil Code upon making the division.<br\/><br\/>On the\u00a0 12th of September, 1906, the representative of the minor natural child of the testator objected in writing to the partition proposed by the administrator, and for the reasons he set forth asked that the same be disapproved, and that in lieu thereof the entire estate be\u00a0 adjudicated to Emilio Escuin y Batac, the said minor.<br\/><br\/>Upon a hearing for the approval of the said proposed partition,\" the representative of the\u00a0 minor presented as evidence a certified copy of the complaint, the answer, and the final judgment rendered in civil case No.\u00a0 3240 of the Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the said certified proceedings that the representative of the minor, as\u00a0 plaintiff therein, asked on. the 12th of January, 1905, that an allowance be granted to him for subsistence for account of the estate of the late testator, Emilio Escuin de los Santos, and that the\u00a0 same be paid him monthly in advance; that judgment be entered declaring\u00a0 that the minor, Emilio Escuin y Batac, is a natural child of the testator; that the said minor, as the only natural son of the same is his general heir; that it be held that the said testator had died without either lawful ascendants or descendants; that\u00a0 the designation of heirs\u00a0 made under his above-mentioned will be declared null and void; and that\u00a0 the defendants be sentenced to pay the costs in case they did not conform to the complaint, with any\u00a0 further remedy that\u00a0 the court might consider just and equitable.<br\/><br\/>The administrator, Ricardo Summers, in answer to the complaint denied all and every one of the facts alleged in all and every one of its paragraphs.<br\/><br\/>On the 30th of September, 1905, the court below found that Emilio Escuin y Batac was the recognized natural child of the late Emilio Escuin de los Santos, had by Julia Batac; that the testator was also the natural son of the defendant Francisco Escuin and Eugenia de los Santos, and was recognized by his father; and that the plaintiff minor, Emilio Escuin y Batac, is one of the heirs of the late testator.<br\/><br\/>By an order of the lower court dated the 30th of October, 1906,\u00a0 in view of the accounts and proposal of partition presented\u00a0 by\u00a0 the administrator of the estate, the judge below expressed an opinion that a natural child is only entitled to one-fourth of the hereditary property, the clause in the will\u00a0 being annulled only in so far as the amount to be divided should be reduced, taking into account the share due to the natural son and the right of the father and the widow of the testator, each to one-half of the remainder of the property of the estate.\u00a0 The court approved the account presented, but disapproved the project of partition of the hereditary property that\u00a0 was objected to by one of the\u00a0 parties in interest.\u00a0 Counsel for the minor Emilio Escuin y Batac excepted to the above resolution; a copy of the proceedings\u00a0 was submitted to this court together with the appeal that was interposed.<br\/><br\/>On the 10th of July, 1907, the representatives of the administrator, and of the minor, Emilio Escuin y Batac, respectively, stated in writing to the lower court that, in view of the fact that the order of October 30, 1906, did not constitute a final judgment of partition (since the said proposal having been rejected, another partition should be effected by commissioners) the court was requested to appoint commissioners to present a new project of partition in substitution for the one presented by the administrator, the new proposal to be\u00a0 submitted to the court for approval.<br\/><br\/>On the 22d of August, the attorney for the administrator filed a written request for the appointment of said commissioners as stated above, and further requested that the remuneration of the petitioner for his services as administrator be fixed by the court, and that he be authorized to draw from the funds of the estate such sum\u00a0 as might thus be assigned to him.<br\/><br\/>On the 24th day of the said month of August, the court below issued an order with respect to the foregoing requests and held that, for the reasons stated in the order, the appointment of commissioners for the mere purpose of determining what each one of the heirs should receive in accordance with the order of the 30th of October, 1906, was not necessary, inasmuch as the property of the estate consisted of ready money, and the administrator was thereby authorized to distribute the funds among the heirs in the amount stated in the said order.\u00a0 From this decision the representative of the minor Emilio Escuin y Batac took exception, and to this effect presented a bill of errors together with a copy of the proceedings for review on appeal.<br\/><br\/>While the appeals interposed against the report and resolution of the commissioners were still pending in the lower court, the partition of the hereditary funds could \u00a6 not be ordered, notwithstanding the fact that the same consisted of ready money, because the amount of the estate subject to division had not yet been determined in order to comply with the law and the will of the testator.<br\/><br\/>Until all the known creditors and the legatees have been paid, it shall be\u00a0 understood that the estate is under administration, says article 1026 of the Civil Code, and in conformity with this legal provision the supreme tribunal has established the doctrine that \"only after payment of all the obligations of the estate can the net amount divisible among the heirs be known.\"\u00a0 (Decision of March 2, 1896.)<br\/><br\/>Section 753 of the Code of Civil Procedure confirms the provision of the Civil\u00a0 Code and the legal doctrine mentioned above, inasmuch as it provides that, after payment of the debts, funeral charges, and expenses of administration, and the allowances for\u00a0 the expense of maintenance of the family of the deceased, the court shall assign the residue of the estate to the persons entitled to the same, naming the persons and proportions or parts to which each is entitled, etc.<br\/><br\/>As to the aforesaid appeals from\u00a0 the resolution of the commissioners, section 776 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"Upon the lodging of such appeal with the clerk, the disputed claim shall stand for trial in the same manner as any other action in the Court of First Instance, the creditor being deemed to be the plaintiff, and the estate the defendant, and pleadings as in other actions shall be filed.\"<\/blockquote>So that by reason of the claims made by the creditor of the estate of Emilio Escuin de los Santos and\u00a0 by\u00a0 her natural son, duly recognized by his father, an ordinary action should have been brought before the Court of First Instance, from whose judgment appeal may be taken to this court by means\u00a0 of the corresponding bill of exceptions under the provisions of section 777 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and while the ultimate decision in the matter of the said claims against the resolution of the commissioners has not become final, and until all the obligations of the estate have been paid, there can really be no inheritance, nor can it be distributed among\u00a0 the\u00a0 persons interested therein according to the will of\u00a0 the testator, or under the provisions of the law.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing refers to the first error assigned in the certified copy of the proceedings and in the brief of the representative of the minor Escuin y Batac, and\u00a0 also to the questions of the form of procedure.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the questions which form the basis of this litigation and refer to the second\u00a0 assignment of errors, it should be noted that the late testator did not leave any legitimate descendants or ascendants, but did leave\u00a0 a recognized natural child, the, appellant\u00a0 minor, and a widow; that the said minor,\u00a0 Emilio Escuin y Batac, is the general heir of his natural father,\u00a0 the said testator, who recognized him while living (art. 807, Civil Code), and in the present case is entitled to one-third of \"his estate, which amount constitutes the legal portion of a natural child (art. 842 of the said code); and for the reason that the minor was ignored by his natural father in his\u00a0 will, the designation of heirs made therein was, as a matter of fact annulled by force of law, in so far as the legal portion of the said minor was thereby impaired.\u00a0 Legacies\u00a0 and betterments shall be valid, in so far as they are not illegal, for the reason that a testator can not deprive the heirs of their legal portions, except in the cases expressly indicated by law.\u00a0 (Arts. 763, 813, 814, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>As has been seen, the testator wished to dispose of his property in his will, designating as heirs his natural father, Francisco Escuin, and\u00a0 his wife, Maria Teresa Ponce de Leon, altogether ignoring his recognized natural child who is his general\u00a0 heir.\u00a0 In view thereof, and for the reason that he exceeded his rights, the said designation of heirs became void in so far as it impaired the right of his general heir and deprived him of his legal portion; the will, however, is valid\u00a0 with\u00a0 respect to the two-thirds of the property which the testator could freely dispose of. (Arts. 763, 764, 806, 813, 842,\u00a0 Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the\u00a0 fact that the designation of heirs is annulled\u00a0 and that the law recognizes the title of the minor, Escuin y Batac, to one-third of the property of his natural father, as his lawful and\u00a0 general heir, it is not proper to assert that the late Emilio Escuin de los Santos died intestate in order to establish the conclusion that his said natural recognized child is entitled to succeed to the entire\u00a0 estate under the provisions of article 939 of the Civil Code, inasmuch as in accordance with the law a citizen may die partly testate and partly intestate (art. 764, Civil Code).\u00a0 It is clear and unquestionable that it was the wish of the testator to favor his natural father and his wife with certain portions of his property\u00a0 which, under the law, he had a right to dispose of by will, as he has done, provided the legal portion of his general heir was not thereby impaired, the two former persons being considered as legatees under the will.<br\/><br\/>The above-mentioned\u00a0 will is\u00a0 neither null, void, nor illegal in\u00a0 so far as the testator leaves\u00a0 two-thirds\u00a0 of his property to his father and wife; testamentary provisions impairing the legal portion of a general heir shall be reduced in so far as they are illegal or excessive.\u00a0 (Art. 817, Civil Code.)\u00a0 The partition of the property of the said testator shall be proceeded with in accordance with the foregoing legal bases.<br\/><br\/>The record does not show that the decision of the commissioners became final or was consented to by the parties in interest, or that this point was alleged and discussed in the first instance; therefore, such circumstance as alleged by the appellee can not now be considered.<br\/><br\/>By virtue of the foregoing considerations it is our opinion that the orders of the court below, of October 30, 1906, and August 24, 1907, should be reversed, and upon receipt of a certified copy of this decision the court below shall take action\u00a0 in accordance with the law and the terms herein contained with respect to the claims and appeals from\u00a0 the resolutions of the commissioners pending judicial decision.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

On that night the chief of police, Vadlit, was not in uniform.<br\/><br\/>A complaint was filed on the 14th of March 1900, charging Sixto Chaves, Simeon Agravante, Apolinario Camacho, and Marcelino Acupan with the crimes of illegal detention, lesiones, and attempt against an agent of the authorities. The corresponding proceedings were instituted, and\u00a0 the judge rendered judgment on the 3d of May, 1006, sentencing Simeon Agravante, for the crime of arbitrary detention, to pay a fine of 500 pesetas and one-fourth of the costs, and to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency in the payment of the fine; Marcelino Acupan was sentenced for <i>maltrato de obra<\/i> to the penalty of five days of <i>arresto menor<\/i> and one-fourth of the costs; Sixto Chaves and Apolinario Camacho were acquitted with the remainder of the costs <i>de oficio<\/i>.\u00a0 From the above judgment the accused Agravante appealed.<br\/><br\/>From the evidence adduced at the trial of this case it appears that the crime of arbitrary detention, included in case No. 1 of article 200 of the Penal Code, was committed, inasmuch as, from the facts stated, it appears that on the night of January 13, 1906, Vicente Iba\u00f1ez, doorkeeper at the Rizal Circus, situated at the capital of Occidental Negros, was maltreated by Marcelino Acupan, a constabulary soldier, for which reason, when Iba\u00f1ez was conducted to the <i>cuartel<\/i> by another, Fortunato Vadlit, the chief of the municipal police accompanied him to the door of the <i>cuartel<\/i> when the latter, together with Iba\u00f1ez, was locked up in the jail by the accused,\u00a0 Simeon Agravante, a corporal of Constabulary; the detention lasted for about an hour.\u00a0 They were then released by sergeant Leandro Gargue\u00f1a, when he became aware that there was no legal reason for the detention, because the chief of police, Vadlit, had taken no part in the quarrel at the gate when Iba\u00f1ez was maltreated by Acupan; he merely approached the place of the incident in order to find out what had occurred, and, at the request of Iba\u00f1ez, accompanied him to the <i>cuartel<\/i> for the purpose of assisting in the investigation of the matter.<br\/><br\/>The accused, Agravante, the only one who appealed from the judgment of the court below, pleaded not guilty, but confessed to having detained both Iba\u00f1ez and the chief of police, Fortunato Vadlit, because the latter was drunk and wanted to force an entrance to the <i>cuartel<\/i> to make an investigation.\u00a0 However, in view of the preponderance of evidence offered by the prosecution in favor of the statements made by Vadlit, the allegations of the accused can not be taken as proven; rather to the contrary.\u00a0 It has been shown that by reason of the remarks made by Vadlit to Agravante when Iba\u00f1ez was detained, Vadlit was\u00a0 arrested ; therefore, it is unquestionable that\u00a0 the conduct of the accused was arbitrary and illegal in ordering the detention of the chief of police, because there was no legal reason for it.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime of arbitrary detention no mitigating or aggravating circumstance was present, and in view of the fact that the offended parties only remained about an hour in confinement, the penalty to be imposed is that prescribed in case No. 1 of said\u00a0 article 200, a fine, in the application of which the provisions of article 83 of the Penal Code should be taken into account.\u00a0 Therefore, the judgment appealed from should be\u00a0 affirmed as to the appellant, even if circumstance No. 8 of article 9, referred to in the decision of the court below, is not considered, inasmuch as the fact mentioned therein, that Corporal Agravante thought he had authority to detain the chief of the municipal police for trying to investigate what had taken place, does not constitute the circumstance No. 8 of article 9 of the Penal Code alluded to.<br\/><br\/>It is of record that, on the night in question, Fortunato Vadlit was not in his uniform of chief of police; hence he was not qualified to exercise his office and make himself known as such chief of police, and for this reason the crime of attempt against an agent of the authorities could not have been committed.\u00a0 It should further be considered that without an order from competent authority he could not have made an investigation in the <i>cuartel<\/i> Constabulary; he should have reported the matter to the municipal president or to the commanding officer, and then what afterwards took place might have been avoided.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from, whereby Simeon Agravante is sentenced to pay a fine of 500 pesetas, and to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of\u00a0 insolvency, with one-fourth of the costs, should be affirmed, all costs as to this second instance to be also charged against him.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J.,\u00a0 Mapa, Johnson, Carson,\u00a0 Willard,<\/i> and <i>Tracey, JJ.,<\/i> concur. <\/div>",

The goods were offered for sale at auction;\u00a0 bids were received, and sales were effected.\u00a0\u00a0 Hence, there was a sale which determines the right of the plaintiff to collect his commission, inasmuch as it, the sale, was the only fact that was stipulated as a condition for the earning of the commission in question.\u00a0 The fact that the agent of the defendant\u00a0 was the\u00a0 successful bidder, or buyer, does\u00a0 not in the least affect the right\u00a0 of the plaintiff, inasmuch as no agreement was made to exempt from commission the goods bought by the said agent.\u00a0 The work that it\u00a0 was the duty of the plaintiff to perform was fully accomplished upon the sale of said\u00a0 goods being made in favor of the highest bidder, whoever he might\u00a0 have been.\u00a0 This was all that the plaintiff was obliged to do in compliance with the agreement entered into with the defendant.<br\/><br\/>As to the P16.50, the cost of the announcement of the sale published in the newspapers, the appellant states in his brief that it is not worth while discussing it.\u00a0 There is really no solid ground for objecting to such\u00a0 payment. The conclusion of the court below on this point is correct, and should therefore be sustained.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance\u00a0 against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

It was also proven that the plaintiff had stated on one occasion that he had given the land as a wedding present to his cousin Francisco, when Francisco married his sister in 1900; and that he had stated that the land was the property of his cousin, Francisco, on an occasion when Warner, Barnes &amp; Co. were endeavoring to induce the plaintiff to mortgage it as security for the payment of a debt due them from the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff testified that his cousin, Francisco Delgado, occupied the land merely as his \"man in charge;\" that he paid the taxes by his direction, and while he admitted that he knew that his cousin had declared the land in his own name on the land assessment records, plaintiff swore that he had not authorized him so to do. Plaintiff did not deny the statement of the witnesses that he had told them that the land had been given to Francisco as a wedding present, although he was on the stand after this testimony had been introduced in evidence and had an opportunity to do so if he desired.<br\/><br\/>The trial court was of opinion that this evidence did not sustain the plaintiff's allegation of ownership of the land in question, and we think this finding must be sus\u00adtained. The presumption that the plaintiff having been the owner of the land in 1900 continued to own it up to the time of the filing of his complaint, would appear to be rebutted, as between the plaintiff and these defendants, by evidence of its delivery to Francisco Delgado, and its occupation by him for a number of years under a claim of ownership, taken together with the plaintiff's admissions that he had given the land to Francisco Delgado and that Francisco was the owner.<br\/><br\/>It was the duty of the plaintiff to sustain his allegation of ownership by a preponderance of evidence, and, having failed so to do, his prayer for a permanent injunction to restrain the defendants from attaching the land was properly denied.<br\/><br\/>It has been suggested that the evidence as to the statements of the plaintiff touching the gift of the land was not the best evidence of such a gift and that it was therefore improperly admitted. But no objection was made to the admission of this evidence in the court below, and in the absence of objection we think the court properly took it into' consideration in rebuttal of plaintiff's claim of ownership.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for plaintiff objected in the court below to the introduction of evidence as to the. payment of taxes by Francisco Delgado, and his entry of the property in his own name in the land assessment records. We agree with counsel that proof that one has paid taxes on a certain piece of land, and that it stands in his name in the land assessment records, is not conclusive proof of ownership; but such testimony would appear to be competent and material in this case in so far as it tends to throw light upon the nature of the claim, of <i>the claim of possession<\/i> asserted by the occupant of the land, with the knowledge and tacit consent of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the trial court is affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered..<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Manuel Ramirez propietario de las vestiente del monte Sabani y, en su consecuencia, al adjudicar dichas vertientes a los solicitante, declarandoles comprendidos en el N.4 del art.o 54 de la Ley N. 926\".<br\/><br\/>2.o \"Porque los solicitantes no estan tampoco dentro de las condiciones del N.6 del art.o 54 de la Ley N. 926, y no pueden, por tanto, solicitar, bajo tal disposicion, la confimacion de su derecho ni la consiguiente expedicion de un certificado de titulo de las vertientes de que se trata, a su favor\".<br\/><br\/>3.0 \"Porque ni D. Manuel Ramirez ni sus causahabientes han Valle del Sabani bajo las condiciones que la ley requiere para que pueda adquirirse por prescripcion la propiedad de un inmueble mediante la simple posesion\".<br\/><br\/>No parece necesario considerar el 2.0 y 3.er motivos de error, el ultimo porque como punto de hecho, el en que se basa, apreciado en una Resolucion de la enterior soberania y por el Tribunal sentenciador, no hallamos razon que lo evidencie como falto de prueba en la resultancia de lo actuado en el expediente, y el 2.o porque se funda la concesion de la inscription y del titulo en el N.o 4 del art.o 54 de la Ley N. 326.<br\/><br\/>Cuanto al 1.er motivo de error, no consideramos posible no hacedero, en buenos principies de derecho, que los Tribunales de la actual soberania delcaren la nulidad de una Resolucion firme y pasada en autoridad de cosa juzgada durante la anterior.\u00a0 En la causa Roura contra el Gobierno Insular (Jur. Filp. VIII, 209) declaro este Tribunal Supremo: 1.p \"que la resolucion administrativa no recurrida en absoluto se hace firme y constituye una decision del asunto entre los interesados: 2.o que, cualquiera que sea el caracter de la resolucion de la anterior soberania; cualquira que fuera el vicio de que adoleciera o el agravio que infiriera a particulares, lo logico y legal era que el error, la infraccion de ley, la falta de competencia, el exceso de poder, la vulneracion del derecho singular, todo lo que cupiera objetares se hubiera objetado en forma de recurso y en el tiempo debido ante las autoridades gerarquicas por la via gubernativa o en su caso por la contencioso-administrativa ante los Tribunales de este nombre que existian en aquella sobrrania\".<br\/><br\/>La resolucion de que se trata era de las que causaban estado: contra ella procedia el recurso contencioso en el termino de tres meses.\u00a0 Del 2 de Marzo fecha de la Resolucion al 13 de agosto de 1898 en que fue ocupada militarmente la Ciudad de Manila no ha dejado de funcionar el Tribunal de lo Contencioso-Administrative Espa\u00f1ol y hubo cinco meses para recurrir.\u00a0 Y aunque mo mas que iniciado el recurso contencioso levantada que hubiera sido la suspension de los terminos judiciales a consecuencia de la guerra, a esta misma Corte Suprema hubiera podido corresponder su conocimiento, conforme al Art.o 38 de la Ley No. 136.<br\/><br\/>Hubo un decreto de composicion a favor del causante de los solicitantes.\u00a0 Y hubo competencia notoria de parte de la Direccion General de Administracion Civil que la decreto, segun se hizo constar en la misma Resolucion.<br\/><br\/>Por tanto, confirmamos la sentencio apelada, sin especial pronunciamiento de costas en esta instancia.\u00a0 Y trascurridos 20 dias dictese sentencia, devolviendose, a los 10 de dictada, los autos al Tribunal de origen.<br\/><br\/>Ais se ordena.<br\/><br\/><i>Gomez, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Willard<\/i> y <i>Tracey.<\/i><\/div><\/div>",

He had under his charge 12 or 15 men whose business it was to take care of and clean the building. In the month of April, one of these men was Manuel Manalo. The work assigned to him was the cleaning of the water closets. The work done by all of these laborers had to be performed before the offices opened in the morning or after they were closed at night. The water closets were cleaned only once a day and that work was done by Manuel Manalo in the morning before 8 o'clock. During the month of April he went to the building every day about half past 6 and performed this work, which was all the work that was assigned to him, and which was all the work which he had to perform during the entire day. He was not in the building any day after 9 a. m. There was evidence, however, that it was the duty of these men to remain in the building so that if any extraordinary work should be required of them they would be there to perform it. The evidence shows that some of the men were allowed to go away, and others stayed there and that those that stayed there did nothing except to perform the regular work assigned to them.<br\/><br\/>On the 1st of May, 1907, a pay roll was made out for the month of April. It contained the names of all the workmen and a square against each name for each day in the month. All of the squares against the name of Manuel Manalo contain a vertical line. The defendant signed the following certificate upon this pay roll: \"I certify that I have been in charge of the men whose names appear on the above roll during the period indicated, that the roll is correct, and that the labor has been performed as stated.\" Manuel Manalo received pay at the rate of 70 cents a day and for the month of April he was paid 21.<br\/><br\/>A complaint was filed against the defendant charging him, as a public official, with the falsification of a public document, to wit, this pay roll, it being alleged that the certificate which he attached thereto was false. He was convicted in the court below of the crime charged against him and has appealed.<br\/><br\/>To our minds the only question in the case is as to the meaning of the vertical lines placed in the squares opposite the names of these laborers. It is claimed by the appellant that they only mean that the persons to whom the lines referred had performed upon the days mentioned the services which had been required of each one. If this is the correct meaning of these lines, then the certificate signed by the defendant was true, because it was proven that Manuel Manalo had performed during the month of April all the work which was assigned to him. it is claimed by the Government, however, that these lines indicate, not that Manuel Manalo performed all the work that was required of him during the day, but that he was present in the building during all of the day and it relies upon the following statement made at the top of the pay roll: \"Mark the time each day in ink under the proper date, using full or fractional marks for part of a day as earned.\" The Attorney-General insists that, inasmuch as Manuel Manalo was not present all of the day, the time during which he was present should have been indicated by a. fractional mark. There are no fractional marks upon this time roll. Mr. Dorrington, the then superintendent of public buildings and a witness for the Government, was asked: \"What mark is generally made on the labor pay rolls to indicate a man has worked one-half a day?\" and he answered: \"I do not know what would be put there in a case of that kind.\" He further testified: \"Q. Have you ever seen on the pay roll a man's name for one half a day's work?\u2014A. Not that I recall; it may be possible in some cases; I do not recall.\"<br\/><br\/>If that part of the certificate signed by the defendant which states that he had been in charge of the men was correct, and that part which states that the labor had been performed was correct, the only question is, Is that part of the certificate which says \"that the roll is correct,\" false or true? After considerable hesitation we have come to the conclusion, in view of all the testimony in the case, that it can not be said that this statement was false; in other words, that the vertical lines do not necessarily mean that the person against whose name they appear was present in the building during every hour of the day. The defendant, therefore, can not be convicted of the crime of falsification of a public document by a public official.<br\/><br\/>There are some additional facts in the case not before stated, which to our mind have no bearing upon the precise question in this case, namely, whether the defendant is guilty of the crime charged against him, for the crime thus charged does not depend upon the advantage or profit which the defendant may obtain from the falsification. A defendant may be guilty of this crime without in any way profiting thereby. The additional facts referred to are the following:<br\/><br\/>It was proven by the Government and admitted by the defendant, that during the month of April, and for some time before, Manuel Manalo was and had been the defendant's cook; that after he had finished his work at the city hall in the morning the defendant gave him money and sent him to' the market where he bought provisions; and that he returned to the city hall, stayed there until about 9 o'clock, and then went to the defendant's house where he worked as cook until about 2 o'clock in the afternoon and then went to his own house. For these services as a cook the defendant paid nothing, although he claims that he was educating the minor child of Manuel Manalo. That this conduct of the defendant in availing himself of the services of Manuel Manalo under the circumstances was grossly irregular and that it perhaps constitutes a crime under the provisions of the Penal Code is not to our minds decisive of the question here raised. However delinquent the defendant may have been, the question here is, Did his delinquency amount to the crime of the falsification of a public document?\u00a0\u00a0 If it did not, he must be acquitted of the present charge and we can not inquire under this complaint as to what other offense he may have committed.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed and the defendant is acquitted, with the costs of both instances <i>de oficio.<\/i><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

S. Crossfield, judge of the third <i>sala<\/i> of the Court of First Instance of this city, declaring their daughter, Silvina Chio-taysan y Caballero, their intestate heir.\u00a0 By virtue thereof, I inscribe, in favor of the said Silvina Chio-taysan y Caballero, the right she has acquired over the property of this number, under title by intestate inheritance.\u00a0 All the above appears from the previous records and from the copy of the above judicial order, issued by Don Salvador Chofre, assistant clerk of the Court of First Instance of this city, on August 5,1903, which document was presented to this registry at\u00a0 8.50 a. m. on the 25th day of February last, as per record\u00a0 No.\u00a0 452, page 266, of the 7th volume of the <i>Diario<\/i>.\u00a0 And all the above being in accordance with the document above referred to, I sign these presents in Manila, on March 9, 1904\u2014Fees: $7.50, No. 7, Tariff of Fees.\u2014Alberto Barretto.\"<\/blockquote>On the 26th day of May, 1904, the said\u00a0 Silvina Chio-Taysan borrowed the sum of P2,500 from the Fire\u00a0 and Marine Insurance and Loan Co., of which the plaintiff is the lawfully appointed liquidator, and mortgaged the land in question as security for the repayment of the loan.<br\/><br\/>Thereafter the husband\u00a0 of Silvina Chio-Taysan instituted special proceedings under the provisions of the present Code of Civil Procedure, for the administration of the estate of Avelina Caballero, deceased, and on the 16th day of October, 1905, he was, in accordance\u00a0 with his petition, appointed administrator; and thereupon,\u00a0 submitted as such administrator, an inventory of the property of the estate, in which was included the land in question; and on the 28th of November, 1905, Francisca Jose, the intervener in this action, submitted her claim to the commissioner appointed in these proceedings, for the sum of 1,000 pesos, Mexican currency, loaned the deceased, as above set out, on the 28th day of March, 1904, which claim was duly approved on the 31st of August, 1906.<br\/><br\/>On the 10th day of October, 1906, the plaintiff in this action filed its complaint against the defendant, Silvina Chio-Taysan, praying for judgment for the amount loaned her as above set out, and the foreclosure of its mortgage upon the land.\u00a0 To this complaint the defendant, Silvina Chio-Taysan, filed her answer, admitting the facts alleged in the complaint and declining to interpose any objection to the prayer of the complaint; but on the 30th of October, 1907, Francisca Jose was permitted to intervene and file her separate \"complaint in intervention\" wherein she set out the facts touching the loan made by her to Avelina Caballero, deceased, and prayed that the court declare the mortgage executed by Silvina Chio-Taysan rescinded and of no\u00a0 effect; and further that it annul the inscription in the land registry of the title of Silvina Chio-Taysan to the land in question;\u00a0 and declare this land subject to her claim\u00a0 against the estate of Avelina Caballero, deceased.<br\/><br\/>The trial court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against both the defendant\u00a0 and the intervener in conformity with the prayer of the complaint, and the intervener brings that judgment before this court for review upon her bill of exceptions duly signed and certified.<br\/><br\/>We do not think that the judgment of the trial court can be sustained in so far as it wholly denies relief to the intervener, Francisca Jose.\u00a0 The trial judge denied the relief prayed for by the intervener, on the ground that her intervention in this action was for the purpose of enforcing her alleged lien arising from her possession of the written title deeds to the land, and that, since she admitted that she had submitted her claim against the estate of Avelina Caballero, deceased, to the\u00a0 committee appointed in the administration proceedings, she must be taken to have abandoned whatever lien she may have held as security therefor, in accordance with the provisions of section 708 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><blockquote>The prayer of her complaint in intervention, however, is merely for the rescission and annulment of the mortgage contract between the loan company and the defendant and of the inscription in the land registry of the title of the defendant, and a declaration that as a creditor of the estate she has a superior right to that of the plaintiff company in the proceeds of any sale of the land in question.\u00a0 She does not seek to enforce her claim and recover her debt in this proceeding, but merely to prevent the plaintiff from securing a judgment in this action which would take out of\u00a0 the estate property which she believes to be subject to her claim set up in the administration proceedings.\u00a0 If her contentions are well founded, and if the estate of the deceased is subject to the payment of the debts of the deceased in such form that the heirs of the deceased could not alienate this land free of the claims of the creditors of the deceased against the land, for the payment of their claims against the deceased, the intervener is clearly entitled to at least so much of the relief she seeks in this action as\u00a0 will have the effect of preventing the sale of this land under the plaintiff's foreclosure proceedings, free of the claims of creditors of the deceased, because, if the plaintiffs in this action were permitted to foreclose their mortgage and to recover their debt from the sale of the land in question, it might well be that there would not be sufficient property in the estate to pay the amount of the claim of the intervener against the estate.<\/blockquote>Had the transactions above set out taken place under\u00a0 the system of law in force\u00a0 in these Islands immediately prior to the 1st day of October, 1901, when the new Code of Civil Procedure went into effect, there would be no difficulty in determining the respective rights of the various parties to this action.\u00a0 Article\u00a0 657 of the Civil\u00a0 Code provides that <i>Los derechos d la sucesion de una persona se transmiten desde el momento de su muerte<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0 (The rights to the succession of another\u00a0 are transmitted\u00a0 from the moment of his death); and article 661 provides that <i>Los herederos suceden al difunto por el hecho solo de su muerte en todos sus derechos y obligaciones.<\/i>\u00a0 (Heirs succeed the deceased\u00a0 by the mere fact of his death, in all his rights and obligations). Under these, and co-related provisions of the Civil\u00a0 Code, a sole and exclusive heir (as defined in article 660 of the Civil Code)\u00a0 became the owner of the property and was charged with the obligations of the deceased at the moment of his death, upon precisely the same terms and conditions as the property was held and as the obligations had been incurred by the deceased prior to his death, save only that when he accepted the inheritance, \"with benefit of an inventory\" he was not held liable for the debts and obligations of the deceased beyond the value of the property which came into his hands.<br\/><br\/>The property of the deceased, both real and personal, became the property of the heir by the mere fact of death of his predecessor in interest, and he could deal with it in precisely the same way in which the deceased could have dealt with it, subject only to the limitations which by law or by contract were imposed upon\u00a0 the deceased himself. He could alienate or mortgage it with the same freedom as could the deceased in his lifetime; the\u00a0 unsecured debts and other personal obligations of the deceased\u00a0 becoming the unsecured debts and personal obligations of the heir for which he was held personally responsible in precisely the same manner as the deceased, save only, as has been said before, where he availed himself of the privilege of taking the estate \"with the benefit of an\u00a0 inventory,\"\u00a0 in which case the extent of his liability was limited to the value of the estate which came into his hands, though in other respects its character as a personal liability remained unchanged.\u00a0 Thus death created no new lien in favor of creditors upon the property of the deceased, which was not in existence at the time\u00a0 of his death;\u00a0 personal debts and obligations of the deceased becoming\u00a0 the personal debts and\u00a0 obligations of\u00a0 the\u00a0 heir,\u00a0 to whom the creditor was compelled to look for payment, with no new right in or to the property of the deceased, in the hands of the heir, which he did not have in or to such property\u00a0 in the hands of the deceased.\u00a0 (Title 3,\u00a0 Book 3\u00a0 of the Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Spanish procedural law provided an action known as an action for the declaration of heirship (<i>declaration de herederos<\/i>) whereby one claiming the status of heir could have his right thereto judicially declared, and this judicial declaration of heirship unless and until set aside or modified in a proper judicial proceeding, was evidence of the fact of heirship which the officials charged with the keeping of the public records, including the land registry, were bound to accept as a sufficient basis for the formal entry, in the name of the heir, of ownership of the property of the deceased.<br\/><br\/>It is evident therefore that, unless the provisions of Spanish procedural and substantive law, in force when the new Code of Civil Procedure went into effect, have been repealed or modified thereby, the defendant in this action, Silvina Chio-Taysan, who was judicially declared to be the sole and universal heir of Avelina Caballero, deceased, became, by the mere fact of the death of Caballero, the absolute owner of the tract of land in question, subject only to such liens thereon as may have existed prior thereto, the personal obligations of the deceased also passing to her at the same time; that, upon proof of such judicial declaration of heirship, the register of deeds of the city of Manila properly entered Chio-Taysan in the land registry as the owner of this land by right of inheritance; and that the Loan Company, of which\u00a0 the plaintiffs are the duly appointed liquidators, was entitled to rely on the properly noted entries in the land registry and that\u00a0 the company's mortgage deed from Chio-Taysan, in whose name the land is registered, could not be affected by the unrecorded claim of indebtedness of the intervene, who must look to the heir for the recovery of her debt.<br\/><br\/>But both the substantive and procedural law touching rights of succession and their enforcement, which were in force in these Islands when the new Code of Civil Procedure went into effect, have, to a greater or less degree, been repealed or modified by its enactment;\u00a0 and we are of opinion that, under the provisions of the new code, the heir is not as such <i>personally<\/i> responsible for the debts of the deceased, in whole or in part; and on the other hand, the property of the deceased comes to him charged with the debts of the deceased, so that he can not alienate or charge it <i>free of such debts<\/i>, until and unless they are extinguished either by payment, prescription, or satisfaction in one or other of the modes recognized by law.<br\/><br\/>It must be admitted that we can not point out the specific section of the new Code of\u00a0 Civil Procedure which in\u00a0 express terms repeals the old law and formally enacts the new doctrine of succession just laid down; but we think that an examination\u00a0 of the various provisions of that code touching the administration of the estates of deceased persons leaves no room for doubt that they do so by necessary implication.<br\/><br\/>The legislators who enact procedural law are predicated.<br\/><br\/>An examination more especially of sections 597, 644, 695, 727, 729, 731, 733, and 749 of the Code of Civil Procedure, read\u00a0 together with the remaining provisions for the administration of the estates of deceased persons, clearly indicates that the provisions of articles 660 and 661 of the Civil Code have been abrogated.<br\/><br\/>These provisions of the new code clearly demonstrate that\u00a0 the terms <i>heredero<\/i> and <i>legatario<\/i>, as defined in the Civil Code (art. 660), are not synonymous with the words \"heir\" and \"legatee,\" as used in the new code; the word \"heir\" in the new code being technically\u00a0 applicable only to a relative taking property\u00a0 of an intestate by virtue of the laws\u00a0 of descent, devisee and legatee being reserved for all persons whether relatives or not, taking respectively real or personal property by virtue of a will; while <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">heredero<\/span> in the Civil Code was applicable not only to one who would be called an \"heir,\" under the provisions of the new code, but also to one, whether relative or not, who took what might be called \"a residuary estate under a will\" (<i>el que sucede a titulo universal<\/i>).<br\/><br\/>It appears also from an examination of these provisions that the legislature has provided no machinery whereby an absolute right on the part of the heir to succeed by the mere\u00a0 fact of death to all the rights and property of the deceased may be enforced, without previous payment or provision for the payment of the debts; and on the other hand, it has provided machinery for the enforcement of the debts and other obligations of the\u00a0 deceased, not as debts or obligations of the heir,\u00a0 but as debts or obligations of the deceased, to the payment of which the property of the deceased may be subjected wherever it be found.\u00a0 Thus section 597\u00a0 expressly provides that, in those cases where settlement of an intestate estate may be made without legal proceedings, either by a family council, as known under the Spanish law, or by an agreement in writing executed by all the heirs, the real estate of the deceased remains charged with liability\u00a0 to creditors\u00a0 of the deceased for\u00a0 two years after\u00a0 the\u00a0 settlement,\u00a0 \"notwithstanding\u00a0 any\u00a0 transfers thereof that may have been made;\" and we think the inference is clear that the legislator in this section recognizes and affirms the doctrine that, prior to the date of such settlement,\u00a0 the real estate at least was charged in like manner with the debts of the deceased.\u00a0\u00a0 So it will be found that, where legal proceedings are had looking to the\u00a0 settlement of testate or intestate estates, provision is made for the recovery of claims against the deceased, not by proceedings directed against the heir, but by proceedings looking directly to the subjection of the\u00a0 property\u00a0 of the deceased to the payment of such claims; the property both real and personal being, in express terms, made chargeable with the payment of these debts, the executor\u00a0 or administrator having the right to the possession of the real as well\u00a0 as the personal property, to the exclusion of the heirs, so long as may be necessary for that purpose (secs. 727 and 729).<br\/><br\/>For practical purposes it may well be said that in the eye of the law, where there is no remedy to enforce an alleged right when it is invaded, the existence of the right may safely be denied; and where the law furnishes a remedy whereby one may enforce a claim, that claim is a right recognized and established by the law.\u00a0 The new Code of Procedure furnishing no remedy whereby the provisions of article 661 of the Civil\u00a0 Code\u00a0 may be enforced, in so far as they impose upon the <i>heredero<\/i> (heir) the duty of assuming as a personal obligation all the debts of the deceased, at least to the extent of the value of the property received from the estate; or in so far as they\u00a0 give to the <i>heredero<\/i> the reciprocal right to\u00a0 receive the property of the deceased, without such property being specifically subjected to the payment of the debts of the deceased by the very fact of his decease, these provisions of article 661 may properly be held to have been abrogated; and the new code having provided a remedy whereby the property of the deceased may always be subjected to the payment of his debts in whatever hands it may be found, the right of a creditor to a lien upon the property of the deceased, for the payment of the debts of the deceased, created by the mere fact of his death, may be said to be recognized and created by the provisions of the new code.\u00a0 (Pavia <i>vs.<\/i> Be la Rosa, 8 Phil. Rep., 70.)<br\/><br\/>It is evident, therefore, that a judgment in an action for the declaration of heirship in favor of one or more\u00a0 heirs could not entitle such persons to be recognized as the owner or owners of the property of the deceased on the same terms as such property was held by the deceased, for it passes to the heir, under the new code, burdened with all the debts of the deceased,\u00a0 his death having created a lien thereon for the benefit of creditor; and indeed an examination of the proceedings prescribed in the new Code of\u00a0 Civil Procedure for the administration and distribution of the estates of deceased persons leaves no room for doubt that those proceedings are exclusive of all other judicial proceedings looking to that end,\u00a0 and supersede the judicial proceeding for the declaration of heirship, as recognized in the old procedure, at least so far as that proceeding served as a remedy whereby the right of specific persons to succeed to the rights and obligations of the deceased as his heirs might be judicially determined and enforced.<br\/><br\/>Examining the facts in the case at bar, in the light of the doctrine as to the law of succession as thus modified and amended by the new Code of Civil Procedure, which went into effect prior to the death of Avelina Caballero, it is evident that her death created a lien upon her property in favor of the intervener Francisca Jose, for the payment of the debt contracted by her during her lifetime, and that this lien ought to have and has priority to any lien created upon this property by the heir of the deceased; that the judicial declaration of heirship in favor of Silvina Chio-Taysan, could not and\u00a0 did not furnish a\u00a0 basis for an entry in the land registry of the name of\u00a0 Silvina Chio- Taysan as the absolute owner\u00a0 of the property of Avelina Caballero; that such entry, improperly made, could not and did not prejudice the lien of the intervener, Francisca Jose, for the debt due her by the deceased (Mortgage Law, art. 33);\u00a0 and that the mortgage of the property of the deceased by her heir, Silvina Chio-Taysan, was subject to the prior lien of the intervener, Francisca Jose, for the payment of her debt.<br\/><br\/>It is not necessary for us to consider the action of the court below in ordering the foreclosure of the mortgage, in so far as it affects the defendant Silvina Chio-Taysan who did not appeal; but we think that the intervener, who is seeking to subject the property of the deceased to the payment of her debt in the administration proceedings now pending, is clearly entitled to so much of the relief prayed for as will have the effect of preventing the application of the proceeds of the sale of this land under foreclosure proceedings to the payment of debts contracted by the heir until and unless it shall appear that the residue of the estate of the deceased is sufficient to satisfy her claim. Such provision for the protection of her rights having been made, the other relief prayed for by her may properly be denied, since a provision subjecting the land in question to the payment of her claim against the estate of Avelina Caballero, deceased, fully and sufficiently protects\u00a0 her rights in the premises, and her rights having been secured, she has no proper interest in the rescission of the mortgage contract between plaintiff and defendant, or the cancellation of the inscription of the\u00a0 defendant's\u00a0 title as heir in the land registry.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the trial court should, therefore, be modified in accordance with the foregoing principles, and the record will be returned to the trial court where judgment will be entered modifying the judgment, by providing that the proceeds of the sale of the land under the foreclosure proceedings will be deposited with\u00a0 the\u00a0 clerk of the court, where it will be retained until the amount of the debt due the intervener and unpaid in the course of the administration of the estate of Avelina Caballero\u00a0 shall have been ascertained, whereupon the said funds shall be applied: first, to extinguish the unpaid residue, if any, of the claim of the intervener; second, to pay the debt due the plaintiff in this action; and finally, the residue, if any, to be paid to the\u00a0 estate of the\u00a0 deceased;\u00a0 the intervener to have her costs in this action in both instances.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The action was prosecuted against the four brothers, but not against the sister because of her death. Judgment was entered against the defendants present, ordering that the amount due be deposited with the court together with interest thereon and costs of the execution, or, in default thereof the sale by public auction of the property mortgaged, for the four-fifths of the value fixed in the obligation, in the event of such sale, as corresponding to the share which the said four defendants possessed in the property.<br\/><br\/>The value stipulated in the written obligation, in the event of a public sale of the mortgaged property, was P22,000, and the upset price fixed in the judgment for execution was P17,000.<br\/><br\/>This judgment was rendered on the 20th of May, 1907, by the Court of First Instance of Manila, before which the action was brought.<br\/><br\/>The money was not deposited, and in consequence the public sale of the mortgaged property was held on September 27, 1907, but no bidders appeared.<br\/><br\/>Thereupon the plaintiff\u2014and this is the question at issue\u2014on the 7th of October of the same year presented the following motion:<br\/><blockquote>\"That on the 27th of September last, a public sale was held by order of the court, of that portion of the property pertaining to the defendants, and no bidders appeared at said public sale. The plaintiff therefore prays that the said property be again sold at auction with such reduction in the upset price as the court may deem proper, and in case of no bidders appearing at such sale, that the court order the adjudication of the property to the plaintiff for the amount owing by the defendants, and already fixed in the judgment of this honorable court.\"<\/blockquote>The amount so fixed in the judgment of May 20, 1907, was \"seven thousand two hundred pesos, Philippine currency (P7,200), with interest thereon at the rate of eighty pesos (P80) per month from March 2, 1904, inclusive, until the deposit is made, and five hundred pesos (P500) for expenses of litigation which must be proportionally paid by the four defendants.\"<br\/><br\/>After hearing counsel for the defendants, and after due consideration of the motion, the court below rendered a well-reasoned decision, the dispositive part of which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote> \"Acceding, therefore, to the prayer of the plaintiff's representative, it is hereby ordered that, after due publication and compliance with the formalities prescribed by the code of procedure in force, the interest or share of the defendants Esteban Aguilar y Hugo, Manuel Aguilar y Hugo, Benito Aguilar y Hugo, and Juliana Aguilar y Hugo in the four-fifths of the mortgaged property described in the judgment which this court rendered on the 20th of May of this year, be again offered for sale at public auction with a reduction of 25 per cent from the P17,000 fixed as upset price at the previous sale, in order to satisfy, with the proceeds thereof, the mortgage debt and the costs for which the said four defendants are liable, as ordered in the said judgment; and according to the result of the sale, or of what the plaintiff may ask in case no bidder should appear thereat, this court will, take such action as may be proper.\"<\/blockquote>The defense appealed from the above order in due course and form; and the court below approved the appeal and suspended the execution.<br\/><br\/>The bill of exceptions being forwarded for the purposes of the appeal, the appellants submitted, to the decision of this court the following alleged errors of law:<br\/><blockquote><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\"FIRST ERROR.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The court below erred in ordering a new public sale of the property in question with a reduction of 25 per cent in the upset price fixed by the parties, to wit, the mortgagee and the mortgagors, for the reason that said order is contrary to the mortgage instrument and to articles 1278 and 1256 of the Civil Code and 127 of the Mortgage Law.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\"SECOND ERROR.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The court below erred in directing that the Spanish civil procedure be followed in the new sale ordered by it, as such ruling is contrary to section 795 of Act No. 190, which provides for the repeal of all procedures in civil actions upon the promulgation of, or from the time when the present law went into force.\"<\/blockquote>In order to decide the question set up, and the bases of the appeal as above set forth, it is first necessary to observe:<br\/><br\/>1. That the original law which regulated the foreclosure of mortgaged real estate was the <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Cwil de 1888<\/i>, articles 1471 to 1513 inclusive; of these it is proper to cite article 1476, which provided for the previous appraisal of the property subject to execution and sale by public auction. Articles 1486, 1487, and 1488 in particular should be noted; they provided that, if there were no bidders, it was optional with the party foreclosing to request either that the property be adjudicated to him for the two-thirds of its appraised value, or that it be again offered at public auction with a reduction of 25 per cent of the assessed value; and, if at said sale no bidders appeared, he might ask for either the adjudication of the property for the two-thirds of the upset price at said second sale, or that it be delivered to him for administration in order to apply the income to the payment of interest and extinction of the principal; if neither of the said two methods suited the judgment creditor, he could ask for a third public sale to be held without reserve. Article 1488 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"In this case, should there be a bidder who offers two- thirds of the price that served as the upset price for the second public sale, and who accepts the conditions thereof, the foreclosure shall be approved.<br\/><br\/>\"If the amount of the said two-thirds is not obtained, the approval of the foreclosure shall be withheld, the judgment debtor shall be informed of the price that has been offered, and he shall be entitled to pay the creditor releasing the property, within the nine days following, or he may present persons willing to increase the bid, making the deposit provided by article 1482.<br\/><br\/>\"At the expiration of the nine days, if the judgment debtor has neither paid nor increased the bid, the foreclosure shall be approved and ordered to be effective.\"<\/blockquote>2. That thereafter came the amended Mortgage Law of 1893, and a much shorter and more rational procedure was introduced by its articles 127 to 133 than had obtained in the Philippines, and is still in force in Spain; formalities were abolished, expenses and delays avoided, and land credit was by this summary means facilitated; such was the original purpose of said law, which was eminently a progressive one, and thus its article 127 provided:<br\/><blockquote>\"In the mortgage shall appear the value of the estate as appraised by the contracting parties which shall serve as a basis for the <i>only<\/i> judicial sale which can take place if,the period of the loan having expired, it does not appear in the registry of property that said loan has been paid.\"<\/blockquote>3. That finally, the foreclosure of mortgaged property is now subject to the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, that is, Act No. 190 of the Philippine Commission, section 257 of which reads thus:<br\/><blockquote><i>\"Sale of the mortgaged property<\/i>.\u2014When the defendant, after being directed to do so, as provided in the last preceding section, failed to pay the principal, interest, and costs at the time directed in the order, the court shall order the property to be sold in the manner and under the regulations that govern sales of real estate under execution;\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"<\/blockquote>And the sale of property in compliance with a judgment is governed by section 457, which reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Sale on execution<\/i>.\u2014All sales of property,under execution must be made at auction, to <i>the highest bidder,<\/i> between the hours of nine in the morning and five in the afternoon. *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * \"<\/blockquote>Assuming this, and deciding the question, as the fundamental fact on which the first error assigned by the appellants is based, the following clause of the mortgage instrument executed by them in favor of their creditor, Legaspi, should be considered.\u00a0 It reads thus:<br\/><blockquote>\"Eighth. That the said party, in accord with Se\u00f1or Legaspi, appraises the mortgaged property in the sum of P22,000, which shall serve as the upset price at the only public sale to be held in accordance with the prescriptions of the Mortgage Law and its Regulations, or with the formalities established by the Code of Procedure in force, if at the time when this obligation becomes due the same is not canceled, with express waiver of any further appraisement and of the respective action.\"<\/blockquote>In accordance with the law that governs the contract, the debtors expressly subjected themselves to \"the provisions of the Mortgage Law and its Regulations,\" and article 172 of the Regulations for the execution of the Mortgage Law provides as follows:<br\/><br\/>Tn paragraph 7\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"Should there be no bidder at this first auction, the claimant <i>may<\/i> request that the property be awarded to him.\"<\/blockquote>In paragraph 8\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"Should the claimant not demand the award (as in the case at bar), he may request that the mortgaged property be again offered at public sale, reducing the figure acceptable at the first one by 25 per cent *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * .\" <\/blockquote>This being the provision of law applied by the court below in the judgment appealed from, equal to that invoked therein, that is, article 1846 of the<i> Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i> mentioned in the preliminary observations, it is evident that the court below did not err, in the manner alleged, when ordering a new sale with a reduction of 25 per cent of the figure acceptable at the first auction, nor is said provision in conflict with the mortgage deed; on the contrary, it entirely agrees with it, and also with article 1278 of the Civil Code, which enjoins the faithful performance of contracts.<br\/><br\/>Nor is it contrary to the provisions of article 1256 of the Civil Code, which only states that \"the validity and fulfilment of contracts can not be left to the will of one of the contracting parties.\" It was not the will of the judgment creditor that prevailed in the order contained in the judgment appealed from, but, as may be seen, it is the express precept of the law itself, which, in establishing the only sale, did not purpose to so behefit the debtor that, in the event that no bidder appeared, the collection of the mortgage debt should remain forever in abeyance, but was expressly made in favor of the creditor, whom the regulations authorize to request a second sale, with a reduction of 25 per cent; this is what was ordered in the judgment appealed from. As a last resort, he is authorized to seek the remedy provided by paragraph 9, the last one of said article 172 of the Regulations for the execution of the Mortgage Law, which reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"If the second auction does not effect the award or sale, others may be held at the instance of the claimant for an amount not less than the preferred credits, said claimant complying with the requisite mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, if proper. In such case the award <i>for said price <\/i>may also be requested, with the obligation of meeting said charges when they fall due, being subrogated in the place of the debtor, as far as the charges are concerned.\"<\/blockquote>The above is equivalent to requesting an award for the amount of his credit where no other preferred credits exist.<br\/><br\/>Finally, the provision contained in the judgment appealed from is not in opposition to article 127 of the Mortgage Law, inasmuch as, although said law has provided for one sole auction sale, the regulations for its execution permit, however, at the instance of the claimant, as has been shown, other sales, always tending to satisfy in any case and in some way the mortgage creditor in whose favor the sole sale was established. In the memorial addressed to the <i>Cortes Legislativas<\/i> when the project of the Mortgage Law was submitted, the following motives were assigned for the amendment:<br\/><blockquote>\"But where the voice of experience has been heard with the greatest clamor against the law, demanding immediate relief, is where it refers to the procedure for making mortgage debts effective. Its crushing confusion, the uncertainty of results, and its incalculable cost restrain capital or suggest usurious conditions; sales and resales take the place of loans, with the object of avoiding all proceedings to the prejudice of the landowner; interest is stipulated which triplicates the capital loaned, and perhaps by the employment of other means the debtor is exposed to penal responsibility, converting the sanctity of laws enacted for the punishment of crimes into a vile instrument of avarice against the unfortunate. Distrust causes these means to be employed because the legal procedure does not satisfy the reasonable requisites of contracts, and to uproot these evils, to furnish land with the capital it needs, and to give the lender assurances of speedy and easy recovery of his loans, is the object of the most important reform proposed by the Government, suppressing proceedings which, without positively guaranteeing one's rights, destroy those most sacred. Previous appraisement, uniformity of judicial action in all necessary investigations, suppression of all litigation, only one summons and the immediate sale by auction, are the bases of the new law. We have abolished suits, exemptions, letters requisitorial <i>(exhortos)<\/i> writs of attachment on the mortgaged property, proceedings in the nature of a demurrer, simultaneous auctions, and a great many other barriers in the path of the credit of realty, which had been placed with the best of intentions, but from which those in good faith were the only victims.\"<\/blockquote>Therefore, the erroneous conception formed of article 127 of the Mortgage Law on the part of the writer of the following in the appellants' brief, becomes evident, to wit:<br\/><blockquote> \"That perhaps the lawmaker, by prescribing the sole sale, had already foreseen the case where, if no bidder appeared at such sale, the creditor would keep the mortgaged property and pay the difference in the value if it was greater than the mortgage, that is, by delivering to the mortgagee the excess of the value of the property, in accordance with the credit and the appraisement fixed by the contracting parties.\" <\/blockquote>It would be absolutely absurd that the creditor should be converted into an obligatory purchaser for the upset price fixed for the public sale, as stipulated in the contract, perhaps not in consideration of the thing itself but of the debtor and other preferred creditors possibly with rights superior to those of the mortgagor, and, by a method of procedure and by reason of defects unforeseen, to convert a contract of mortgage loan into one of sale, in other words, to impose upon the lender the obligation to become a landowner.<br\/><br\/>After all the foregoing considerations it is seen that, in the present case, according to the clause above transcribed, it is the law of contracts that the contracting parties shall submit to the formalities of the present Code of Civil Procedure, that is, to the sale by public auction, without reserve to the highest bidder, as provided by section 457 already cited.<br\/><br\/>In said law no provision whatever exists whereby a second and ulterior sale is prohibited; by section 257 already cited, concerning the sale of mortgaged,property, the necessity of the confirmation of the sale by a decree of the court is prescribed, but at the same time it provides that, if for good reasons the court should decline to confirm such sale and should declare it null and void, it shall direct a new sale to be held in accordance with law.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the order of the court below directing that a new sale be held, is in every way in accordance with the law in force; the fixing of an upset price with a reduction of 25 per cent from the first public sale, however, is not, and in this the appellants are right in alleging, as the second error incurred by the court below, the fact that the Spanish civil procedure was applied for the new sale, that is, the repealed <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento<\/i> Civil formerly in force. Nor should any of the provisions of article 172 of the Regulations for the execution of the Mortgage Law have been applied. It is rightly stated in the appellants' brief that section 795 of Act No. 190 repeals all of the former civil procedures. Therefore, in this part the order appealed from should be amended in the sense that a new sale should be held and the property sold to, the highest bidder, without any reserve whatever.<br\/><br\/>Therefrom the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed in so far as it orders a second sale of the mortgaged property, and reversed in so far as it directs that the sale be effected with a reduction of 25 per cent of the P17,000, the upset price fixed in the previous public sale; the sale to be held shall be in strict conformity with the provisions of section 457 of the Code of Civil Procedure. No special ruling is made as to costs in this instance. So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Carson, Willard<\/i>, and <i>Tracey, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<\/div>",

The defendants are the owners of a number of livery stables in Manila, and employed the plaintiffs, without any express agreement as to compensation, to represent them before the Municipal Board of the city of Manila in an effort to secure certain modifications in section 119 of City Ordinance No. 93 whereby an alleged excessive license tax was imposed upon the business of the defendants; and, further, to secure the repeal of section 120 of the same ordinance, which requires a statement to be submitted of the largest number of saddle horses and vehicles of all descriptions to be kept by an applicant for a license to keep a livery stable, during the period covered by the license, which statement is to be used as a basis for computing the amount to be paid for the license.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs rendered services in accordance with the terms of their contract, and while they failed to secure the repeal of section 120 of the ordinance, their efforts resulted in a modification of section 119, whereby their clients were relieved from the payment of some P368 per annum in license fees. Thereafter plaintiffs submitted a bill for P500 for services rendered, which defendants declined to pay, claiming that it was exorbitant and excessive, and that defendants were attempting to take an unfair advantage of the fact that there had been no express agreement as to the amount of compensation to be charged. The plaintiffs then, formally withdrew the original bill for P500 and rendered a new bill for P1,000 for services rendered. They allege that in the first bill they did not claim the full amount of fees to which they were entitled, because of a friendly disposition toward their clients, which induced them to submit an extremely moderate bill, the principal object of their employment being to saye money for their clients; but that, in view of the attitude of defendants in criticizing and declining to pay the original bill, they are justified in insisting upon payment of the full value of the services rendered.<br\/><br\/>The evidence consisted substantially of a statement of the character and amount of the services rendered and the testimony of two reputable attorneys in Manila, one of whom asserted that P1,000 was in his opinion a reasonable charge for the services, the other testifying with some reserve, but indicating that in his opinion the minimum fee for the work done should be fixed at P500, and that the fee might be increased in proportion to the magnitude of the interests concerned, and the amount per annum saved plaintiffs' clients. The trial court held that the reasonable value of the services rendered by the plaintiffs is the sum of P380, and we would hesitate to modify this finding but for the fact that the trial judge appears to have based his conclusion upon an estimate of the number of hours occupied by the plaintiffs in conference with their clients and with the Municipal Board and its members, but failed to taken into consideration time which may have been occupied by the plaintiffs in preparing the arguments for submission to the Municipal Board, examining authorities, and in general preparation of their case.<br\/><br\/>We do not think that the appropriate method of determining the value of professional services rendered by an attorney is by ascertaining the number of hours dedicated by the attorney to the business in hand. Section 29 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"A lawyer shall be entitled to have and recover from his client no more than a reasonable compensation for the services rendered, with a view to the importance of the subject matter of the controversy, to the extent of the services rendered, and the professional standing of the lawyer. But in such cases the court shall not be bound by the opinion of lawyers as expert witnesses as to the proper compensation, but may disregard such testimony and base its conclusion on its own professional knowledge. A written contract for services shall control the amount of recovery if found by the court not to be unconscionable or unreasonable.\" <\/blockquote>We think that, taking into consideration all of the factors laid down in this section of the code, a reasonable estimate of the compensation to which the plaintiffs are entitled for the services rendered these defendants would be the sum of P500. This was the value which they set upon their services when they rendered the first bill before the altercation arose between themselves and their clients, and while they were entirely within their rights in withdrawing their original bill when payment thereof was refused, and filing a second bill for a larger amount if their services were in fact worth more than the amount originally claimed, we think that, under all the circumstances, and especially in view of the fact that the reduction secured in the license fees of their clients is not necessarily a permanent one, they are not entitled to more than the amount originally claimed.<br\/><br\/>Let judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants for P500 with interest from the 14th day of May, 1907, the date of the filing of the complaint in this action, together with the costs in the court below, no costs to be allowed on appeal.

Trouble then arose between then and it is not to be wondered that, in a moment of excitement, Algurra may have uttered threats, making mention to the women trying to prevent his entrance to the church, of a revolver which, as a matter of fact, he did not carry.\u00a0 Such conduct merely constitutes an offense provided\u00a0 for in article 589, No. 3, of the Penal\u00a0 Code which reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"The following shall be punished with penalties of from one to five days of arrest, or a fine of from 15 to 125 pesetas :<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"3.

Wolf and Un Pak Leung, as sureties, 'are hereby and by these presents firmly bound unto Salih Adad for all rents, damages, and costs, which are now due or may hereafter become due the said Adad by reason of the said James Craig Tow withholding possession\u00a0 of the premises known\u00a0 as Nos. 67 and 69 Calle San Jacinto\u00a0 and 88, 90 and 92 Calle Dasmarinas, in the city of\u00a0 Manila, being the upper floors of said\u00a0 buildings, until the final decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands in this case; should said Supreme Court decide as against the defendant herein, James Craig Tow, this bond shall include the payment of the judgment of one\u00a0 hundred and eight pesos and eighty-nine centavos (P108.89) found due and owing the plaintiff and included in the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>\"The conditions of the said obligations are such that whereas judgment has been rendered in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila against the defendant, James Craig Tow, for the possession of the above-described premises and for money\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 of one hundred and eight pesos and\u00a0 eighty-nine centavos (P108.89) together with costs of said suit, and the defendant having this day appealed from said judgment to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, and should the defendant prosecute his appeal with effect and reverse the judgment herein rendered against him by the Court of First Instance,\u00a0 or in case of its confirmation or modification, pay any money judgment, costs, rents, and damages assessed against him in said cause, then and in that case, this obligation to be null and void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.<br\/><br\/>\"Signed by our hand this 24th day of April, at the city of Manila, P.\" <\/blockquote>Tow remained\u00a0 in possession of the premises until the 30th day of September, 1905.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from was affirmed in this\u00a0 court on the 30th day of April, 1906,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> the case remanded, another judgment apparently\u00a0 entered in the Court of\u00a0 First\u00a0 Instance for the sum of 108.89 and costs, and an execution issued thereon.\u00a0 The defendant Tow paid to the sheriff the full\u00a0 amount of that execution\u00a0 on the 10th day of June, 1906.<br\/><br\/>This action was brought by the plaintiff on the 22d day of August, 1906, against Tow, Wolf, and Un Pak Leung. Final judgment herein was rendered in the Court of First Instance in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants Tow and Wolf for P1,500 with interest, and the costs. Un Pak Leung was never served with process.\u00a0 From that judgment the defendants have appealed.<br\/><br\/>The liability of the defendant Waif rests entirely upon the bond above quoted.\u00a0 It is expressly provided therein that, if the judgment of the Court of First Instance should be affirmed and the defendant Tow pay any money judgment, costs, rents, or damages assessed against him in said cause, then the obligation should be void.\u00a0 Tow had paid the money judgment and all costs, rents and damages which were assessed against him in that action before this action was commenced.\u00a0 No action can therefore be maintained on the bond.<br\/><br\/>It is said by the plaintiff that, while by the terms of the latter part of the bond the defendants have been relieved from liability, yet they remain liable under the first part of the bond, which says that they are held and bound for all rents, damages and costs which are now due or may hereafter become due by reason of the withholding of the possession of the premises by Tow.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of P108.89 included the rent and damages only to the first day of December, 1904.\u00a0 Nothing was included in the judgment entered by the Court of\u00a0 First Instance for the rent accruing after the first day of December, 1904, and it was to recover that rent\u00a0 that this action is brought.\u00a0 The claim of the plaintiff is that that rent is fully covered by the clause above quoted from the first part of the bond.\u00a0 That part, however, is not the part which determines the liability of the persons signing it.\u00a0 It is usual to state therein a definite sum of money, as for example, that the signers\u00a0 are held and bound for the sum of P1,000.\u00a0 Instead of inserting in this bond such a definite sum, the penalty of the bond was expressed in the way in which it appears therein, but the choice of that method of expression can not change the liability of the sureties.\u00a0 They are not liable for the penalty of the bond if they have fulfilled the conditions stated therein.\u00a0 In this case such conditions have been fulfilled and, as has been said, there can be no liability thereon.\u00a0 This disposes of the case upon its merits so far as the defendant Wolf is concerned without considering the exception taken by him to the order overruling his demurrer to the amended complaint.<br\/><br\/>As to the defendant Tow, there are other allegations in the complaint, which it is claimed, make him liable for the occupation of the premises from December, 1904, to September, 1905, without considering his\u00a0 liability\u00a0 upon the bond.<br\/><br\/>Tow demurred to the amended complaint and excepted to the order overruling his demurrer, so that we are bound to consider that exception first, without considering whether, upon the evidence in the case, his liability\u00a0 was made out.\u00a0 The complaint itself shows that the judgment was paid, therefore it stated no cause of action\u00a0 against Tow upon the bond.\u00a0 Neither do we think that it stated any cause of action against him for the occupation of the premises.\u00a0 There is no allegation, except by inference, that Tow was in possession of the premises from December, 1904, to September 30, 1905, and there is no allegation at all of the value of the use of that part of the building occupied by Tow during that time, nor is there any allegation of any agreement on\u00a0 the part of Tow\u00a0 to pay\u00a0 any specific sum therefor.\u00a0 The demurrer to the amended complaint should therefore have been sustained.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court\u00a0 below is reversed, and the defendant\u00a0 Wolf is acquitted of the complaint, with the costs of the first instance against the plaintiff.\u00a0 As to the defendant Tow, the case is\u00a0 remanded to the court below with instructions to that court to sustain his demurrer to the amended complaint and to allow the plaintiff to amend his complaint in accordance with the rules of the court.<br\/><br\/>No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The land was acquired by the applicant by purchase from Higinio Francisco y Prospero, according to a deed of sale dated July 3, 1894, recorded in the registry of property, no other person having any title to or interest therein, and the property was assessed, for the purpose of taxation of the last fiscal year, at $1,444,. United States currency. The buildings erected thereon were paid for by the applicant with his own money, and the application is accompanied by the deed of sale, plan, and technical description of the land.<br\/><br\/>The examiner of titles reported, in due course, that the said building lot was attached by reason of certain pro: ceedings instituted against the applicant for treason and rebellion, yet, inasmuch as the land was acquired by him more than ten years previously, he could be considered the real owner thereof by prescription; but that, in order to obtain title, it was necessary for him to show that said attachment had been discharged or canceled, for which reason he considered the title of the applicant to be defective and that it could not be registered.<br\/><br\/>Against the claim of the applicant the attorney for the city of Manila objected and reproduced the verbal opposition offered in the case, alleging that both the plan and the technical description exhibited contained errors; that there was an excess in the measurement which affected the interests of the city, and that, should the application be granted, an area of 33.40 square meters of the Meisic Creek would become the property of Maximo Cortes, when, as a matter of fact, the said creek was one of public use and belonged to the city of Manila. For these reasons he asked that the registration applied for be denied in so far as it affected the Meisic Creek, with costs against the applicant.<br\/><br\/>Upon an examination of the evidence adduced, the judge rendered his decision on the 11th of March, sustaining the opposition of the city of Manila, and 'ordering that the said land, including its walls, be adjudicated and registered in favor of the applicant upon presentation of an amended description, showing the measurements of the property, including its walls but excluding therefrom the rest of the land shown in Exhibit A.<br\/><br\/>The applicant asked that the case be reopened on account of his having discovered very important proof; to this end he filed an affidavit stating that he had learned the Whereabouts of the original owner of the land, who was better informed with respect to its conditions and location; but, as said motion was overruled, he excepted to the judgment and also moved for a new trial on the ground that the decision of the court was contrary to law and to the weight of the evidence. This motion was likewise denied and exception taken.<br\/><br\/>The dominion of the applicant, Maximo Cortes, over the land or building lot acquired by him from Higinio Francisco y Prospero, according to the public deed executed before a notary on the 3d of July, 1894, registered in the registry of property, is unquestionable and has been fully proven; and, in view of the validity of his title, the city attorney had to limit his opposition to the registration simply to its effect upon the Meisic Creek. The court, upon previous declaration of general default, then ordered the adjudication and registration of the title of the applicant, Cortes, to said building lot upon submitting an amended description of the land.<br\/><br\/>It having been satisfactorily shown that the portion of land included in the technical description presented by the applicant, situated between the lot to which said instrument refers and the bed of the Meisic Creek, has been gradually formed by alluvion, as the result of the current in the said stream, it can not be denied that said portion of land, with an area of 33.40 square meters, belongs by right of accretion to the owner of the land referred to in the instrument of the 3d of July, 1894, exhibited by the applicant.<br\/><br\/>The Law of Waters, promulgated by royal decree of the 3d of August, 1866, and extended to these Islands by a royal decree dated April 8, 1873, provides in article 84 that\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"The accretion resulting from the gradual deposit by or sedimentation from the waters belongs to the owners of land bordering on streams, torrents, lakes, and rivers.\"<\/blockquote>Article 366 of the Civil Code provides that\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"The accretions which banks of rivers may gradually receive from the effects of the currents belong to the owners of the estates bordering thereon.\"<\/blockquote>There is no evidence whatever to prove that the addition to the said property was made artificially by the owner; therefore, the facts alleged and proven in the proceedings must stand. The increase or accretion which in a latent, incessant, and spontaneous manner is received by the land from the effects of \"the current depositing, in the course of time, sediment and alluvial matter along the shore, is undeniably the work of nature and lawfully belongs to the owner of the property; and from the fact that all or almost the whole area of said increased portion is soft and unsettled, one is naturally convinced that it was formed by alluvion, and that for such reason it appertains to the owner of the land bordering thereon, by virtue of the right of accretion recognized by the law.<br\/><br\/>The reason therefore is quite evident because, if lands bordering on streams are exposed to floods and other damage due to the destructive force of the waters, and if by virtue of law they are subject to incumbrances and various kinds of easements, it is only just that such risks or dangers as may prejudice the owners thereof should in some way be compensated by the right of accretion.<br\/><br\/>And, although the acts of possession exercised over the bordering land are always understood legally to cover that portion added to the property by accretion, in this case shrubs have been planted there, which furnish additional proof that Maximo Cortes has exercised rights of ownership and possession over the whole area of the property the registration of which he requests.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, as we do hereby reverse the same, and that the court below should direct that the land to which the appellant refers be recorded in the registry of property, in accordance with the law, including that portion of the same added by accretion up to the water line of the Meisic River, without any special ruling as to costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Rep., 537; Cacnio <i>vs.<\/i> Baens, 5 Phil. Rep., 742; Cansino <i>vs.<\/i> Valdez,\u00a0 6 Phil. Rep., 320.)\u00a0 The case of Taguinot <i>vs.<\/i> The Municipality of Tanay<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> illustrates the kind and degree of proof\u00a0 which is sufficient and necessary to establish rights arising from an agreement of the nature of that alleged by the defendants in this action, when the question arises between the original parties to the agreement.<br\/><br\/>But even had the proof been sufficient to establish the existence of\u00a0 such an\u00a0 agreement in this\u00a0 case, unless the agreement had been duly recorded, proof thereof could not properly be admitted to the prejudice of the plaintiff in this action, who relies for his title upon the terms of the <i>titulo de composition<\/i>, which was registered in <i>El Registro de la Propiedad de Ilocos Norte<\/i>, and whose rights would necessarily be prejudiced by the recognition of\u00a0 the terms of the alleged agreement.\u00a0 (Art. 389, Mortgage Law.) The deed of sale from the Abrueros brothers, the heirs of Manuel Abrueros, conveyed to the plaintiff all their right, title, and interest in\u00a0 the land described in the <i>titulo de composition<\/i>, and, whatever claim the Bacuds may have against Manuel Abrueros or his heirs for breach of the alleged contract made when the <i>titulo de composition<\/i> was issued, they can not be permitted to set up the\u00a0 terms of that private agreement to defeat the title of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of one of the witnesses called at the\u00a0 trial seems to suggest that at the time when the Abrueros brothers sold the land in question to the\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 they were not the sole heirs of Manuel Abrueros, and that his widow and a third brother were entitled to share with them in the inheritance.\u00a0 The defendants in. the court below do not appear to have relied\u00a0 upon or suggested the existence of other heirs of the estate of Manuel Abrueros than the brothers Juan and Ruperto, and it appears from the statement of the only witness who referred to the widow and the third brother that they consented to the sale and received their proportionate share of the purchase price.<br\/><br\/>Upon an examination of the entire record, however, we think the weight of the evidence is sufficient to sustain a finding that Juan and Ruperto Abrueros, who signed the contract of sale, were the sole heirs of their father's right, title, and interest in and to the land\u00a0 in question, with authority to sell the said land to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>If it be true that\u00a0 there wore other heirs in existence at the time of the sale of the land, and that they did not join or consent to the sale, they can, of course, assert their rights in a proper action, but neither the defendant Juan Abrueros nor the defendants Bacud can avail themselves of the unproven interest of these unknown parties as a defense in this action.<br\/><br\/>The trial court appears to have been of opinion that the failure of the defendants Bacud to join in the contract to sell\u00a0 to the plaintiff invalidated that instrument and gave judgment in favor of the defendants.\u00a0 For the reasons heretofore set out this judgment should be, and is hereby, reversed without costs to either party.\u00a0 Judgment wall be entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants for the possession of the land described in the complaint in accordance\u00a0 with the prayer thereof, but without damages, the plaintiff having failed to establish by competent proof the\u00a0 allegations of the complaint as to the nature\u00a0 and amount of the damages claimed.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

His judgment may have been wrong or his action undiscriminating, but the evidence falls short of establishing bad faith, or recklessness, or abuse of power on his part. It would be exacting too much of police officers\u00a0 to require them to inform themselves as to the right or wrong of\u00a0 a quarrel before making an arrest.\u00a0 Their first duty is to restore order, and in doing so they may, in their honest judgment, act on such facts as are patent to their eyes, indicating the guilty person, and in so doing, for the purpose of suppressing present disorder, they may arrest without a warrant.\u00a0 The accused,\u00a0 Gregorio Salvacion, should, therefore, be acquitted.<br\/><br\/>In regard to Pomposo Burgueta, it is unnecessary for us to consider the important question as to his\u00a0 authority as a municipal councilor, outside his barrio, but\u00a0 within the municipality.\u00a0 The evidence satisfies us that in arresting the Chinaman the policeman acted not\u00a0 by\u00a0 the order of Burgueta but by his request, he being One of the contending parties.\u00a0 For this request he is not responsible criminally, whether it resulted in the arrest of the Chinaman alone\u00a0 or in his own temporary detention as well, and whatever may have been the motive of the policeman in complying with it.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the Court of First Instance is hereby reversed and both the defendants are absolved with costs <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de oficio<\/span>.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/i> and<i> Carson, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><i>Willard, J.,<\/i> dissents. <\/div>",

We think that the trial judge must\u00a0 have overlooked the following questions which had been put to the defendant when on the stand:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Is it not true that you stated in the justice of the peace court that it was true that you had ordered a document of purchase and sale made for this land,\u00a0 but\u00a0 that it was only a pretended sale so that you might not be appointed a <i>cabeza de barangay<\/i>?\u2014A. No, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What did you answer to the\u00a0 justice of the peace when you were called there and shown the complaint?\" <\/blockquote>Question ruled out on the ground that it was indefinite.<br\/><blockquote> \"Q. Is it not a fact that you stated before the justice of the peace even if everything that the plaintiff\u00a0 has stated is true, the conditions specified in the document which he offered were not true, as we agreed in a contract to transfer the land to Zacarias Bagsa in order that I would not be appointed cabeza de barangay?\" <\/blockquote>Objection sustained. <blockquote> \"Q. Before the Americans arrived, don't you remember having ordered a document made in Guiuan?\u2014A. No, sir. I did not order any made,\"<\/blockquote>Taken together, these\u00a0 questions, both those allowed and those ruled out, laid a sufficient foundation for the contradiction of the defendant\u00a0 by his admissions made before the justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>The question remains as to whether these admissions came up in a properly authenticated form.\u00a0 They are contained in a duly certified copy of the record under\u00a0 the hand of the clerk.\u00a0 The trial court seems to have held this record inadmissible for the further reason that the justice having no jurisdiction\u00a0 over the cause, a record of it can have no official effect and no greater value as evidence than proof of any other transaction\u00a0 out of\u00a0 court. Assuming that the justice lacked jurisdiction, it is nevertheless the opinion of the majority of this court that the record, properly taken and in due form, constitutes a public record and as such, when properly certified, may be received as evidence of what took place on the hearing before him.\u00a0 This rule is a convenient one, as, otherwise, transactions of a court acting in excess of jurisdiction might be put beyond the possibility of certain proof. While they may not be given validity, it may be necessary to ascertain what they were.<br\/><br\/>The record of the trial in the justice court should, therefore, have been received to the extent of contradicting the denials of the defendant, and when so received, it would have sufficed to establish a decided preponderance of proof in favor of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Examining the record, we fail to find therein sufficient evidence as to the value of the products of the land to serve as foundation for their recovery.\u00a0 The figures before us indicate, at best, only the amount of the gross receipts. Our judgment, therefore, is that the judgment of the trial court be reversed and that the plaintiff recover from the defendant the land described in the complaint, with costs of first instance, but without damages or costs in this court.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Torres, Mapa<\/i>, and\u00a0 <i>Carson, JJ., <\/i>concur.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">WILLARD, J.,<\/span> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">concurring in the result:<\/span><br\/><br\/>I concur in the result, but I think that the admission made by the defendant before the justice of the peace, he being a party to this suit, is substantive evidence against him. <\/div>",

The court below held that he was entitled to recover only 12,000 pesos, and the defendants having deposited that amount in court, judgment was ordered in their favor, from which judgment the plaintiff has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The facts in the case are undisputed. When this document was delivered 12,000 pesos in silver were worth more than 12,000 pesos in gold. The plaintiff delivered to the defendants in consideration of the execution of the document 12,000 pesos in gold.\u00a0 Soon thereafter the plaintiff removed to Barcelona and has since resided there. The defendants remitted the interest to him every three months at the rate of 8 per cent per annum until the 30th day of January, 1888, when they notified him that thereafter the interest would be 6 per cent. The plaintiff accepted this reduction and interest at that rate was remitted to him by the defendants until the 10th of February, 1904. This interest was remitted in silver; that is to say, every three months the defendants took 180 pesos in silver and with it bought exchange on Barcelona or other European point converted into pesetas.\u00a0 The plaintiff received these payments in silver without any protest whatever until the 10th day of February, 1904. He then, in his letter of that date, called the attention of the defendants to the fact that by the new American law in force in the Philippines the gold standard had been introduced and that by reason thereof he was entitled to receive his interest in gold, in view of the fact that when he delivered the money to the defendants in 1876 he delivered it in gold coin. In another letter of the 15th of December, 1904, he expressly refers to the act of Congress of March 2, 1903, and to the subsequent proclamations of the Governor-General relating to coinage. These are practically all the facts, in the case, and the claim of the plaintiff is that, having paid to the defendants 12,000 pesos in gold coin, he is now entitled to receive from them the value of 12,000 pesos in gold coin; that is to say, 24,000 pesos in silver.<br\/><br\/>It is necessary to determine in the first place the nature of the contract evidenced by the document of the 17th of February, 1876.<br\/><br\/>The important, and to our minds decisive, question in the case is, whether or not this document is evidence of an ordinary loan which created between the plaintiff and the defendants the simple relation of debtor and creditor. The appellant in his brief repeatedly calls it a deposit, but we do not understand that he claims that it is or ever was a deposit in the technical sense of the term; that is, that the ownership of the particular coin which was delivered by him to Smith, Bell &amp; Co. did not pass to Smith, Bell &amp; Co. but remained in him and that Smith, Bell &amp; Co. was bound to return to him the identical coin which they had received. It is apparent that no such claim could be maintained in view of that part of the instrument which provides for the payment of interest.<br\/><br\/>It is claimed, however, by the appellant, that while not a deposit in the strict sense of the word, the document evidences what is known as an \"irregular deposit.\" The parties agree that the case must be decided in this respect in view of the legislation in force prior to the adoption of the Civil Code, and the appellant says that the definition of an irregular deposit is found in Law II, Title III of the Fifth Partida. Manresa, in his Commentaries on the Civil Code (vol. 11, p. 064), states that there are three points of difference between a loan and an irregular deposit. The first difference which he points out consists in the fact that in an irregular deposit the only benefit is that which accrues to the depositor, while in a loan the essential cause for the transaction is the necessity of the borrower. The contract in question does not fulfill this requirement of an irregular deposit. It is very apparent that it was not for the sole benefit of Rogers. It, like any other loan of money, was for the benefit of both parties. The benefit which Smith, Bell &amp; Co. received was the use of the money; the benefit which Rogers received, was the interest on his money. In the letter in which Smith, Bell &amp; Co. on the 30th of June, 1888, notified the plaintiff of the reduction of the interest, they said: \"We call your attention to this matter in order that you may if you think best employ your money in some other place.\"<br\/><br\/>Nor does the contract in question fulfill the third requisite indicated by Manresa, which is, that in an irregular deposit, the depositor can demand the return of the article at any time, while a lender is,bound by the provisions of the contract and can not seek restitution until the time for payment, as provided in the contract, has arisen. It is apparent from the terms of this document that the plaintiff could not demand his money at any time. He was bound to give notice of his desire for its return and then to wait for six months before he could insist upon payment.<br\/><br\/>The second difference which exists, according to Manresa, between an irregular deposit and a loan lies in the fact that in an irregular deposit the depositor has a preference over other creditors in the distribution of the debtor's property. That this preference may exist and the transaction be still a loan, appears from the decision of the supreme court of Spain of the 8th of April, 1881. The court there said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Whereas, although the irregular deposit is considered as mutual, with respect to the repayment between the depositor and the depositary, notwithstanding this, the latter retains the original status of personal creditor and is simply privileged, in concurrence with other creditors against the former, and he must be paid after the mortgage creditors and before the creditors whose right appears only by written instruments, in accordance with Law XII, Title XIV, Fifth <i>Partida<\/i>.<\/blockquote>It is apparent, therefore, that this document does not state those requisites which are essential to an irregular deposit.<br\/><br\/>But even if it did, it seems that the appellant's contention could not be sustained. He claims that in accordance with said Law II, Title III, Fifth <i>Partida<\/i>, the defendants are bound to return to him the same kind of money which was received.\u00a0 That law is in part as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"And the ownership of the thing given in deposit is not transferred to the one who receives the same; but, should the thing be one of those which can be counted, weighed, or measured, if, when receiving it, the same were given by count, weight, or measure, then the ownership would be transferred to him. Yet he would be obliged to return the same thing, or the same quantity, or another similar to the one received, to him who gave it to him in deposit.\"<\/blockquote>An examination, however, of Law II, Title I, of the Fifth <i>Partida<\/i>, which relates to loans, will show that the obligation of the borrower in such case is stated in almost exactly the same words.\u00a0 That law is in part as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A man may loan to another any of the things mentioned in the last law which are susceptible of being counted, weighed, or measured.\u00a0 And this is understood with regard to things belonging to him who lends them, or which are loaned by another by authority of his principal; provided, however, that once the thing is in the possession of him who secures the loan, he may dispose of it as though it were his own. But he must return to the owner of the thing an equal amount of the same kind and quality, although the creditor should not specify either of the conditions.\"<\/blockquote>The supreme court of Spain in the judgment of the 27th of October, 1868, speaking of the obligation of the borrower in such case, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Whereas the principle established in Laws I and II of Title I of the Fifth <i>Partida<\/i>, according to which the borrower acquires ownership of the thing and is bound to return an equal amount of the same kind and quality, have special application to cases relating to loans of money or its equivalent; whereas the thing loaned not being in such cases what properly constitutes the material or the object of deposit, as happens with other perishable things, but rather the value that the coins or the paper money represents, the obligation of the depository in this kind of contracts is to return the sum or amount therein expressed, whatever may have been the increase or depreciation suffered by the specific kind of coin or paper, unless the contrary be stipulated.\"<\/blockquote>It seems clear from these citations that the document in question is evidence of an ordinary loan and created between the plaintiff and defendants the relation of debtor and creditor. The two judgments of the supreme court of Spain cited by the appellant in his brief have no bearing upon the question. In that of the 9th of July, 1889, it appeared that the Bank of Havana returned to the plaintiff the same kind of money which it had received from him. The other judgment, of the 7th of February, 1891, simply held that a servant who had left her money with her master and had taken a written obligation from him to pay the same was not, in the distribution of his property, entitled to preference over other creditors on the ground that her debt was for personal labor.<br\/><br\/>It having been determined that the contract between the parties created the common relation of debtor and creditor, the case is easily resolved. Section 3 of the act of Congress of March 2, 1903, entitled \"An act to establish a standard of value and to provide for a coinage system in the Philippine Islands,\" is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That the silver Philippine peso authorized by this act shall be legal tender in the Philippine Islands for all debts, public and private, unless otherwise specifically provided by contract: <i>Provided,<\/i> That debts contracted prior to the thirty-first day of December, nineteen hundred and three, may be paid in the legal-tender currency of said Islands existing at the time of the making of said contracts, unless otherwise expressly provided by contract.\"<\/blockquote>That this case falls within the terms of this section is very clear. The debt in question is a private debt, calling for the payment of 12,000 pesos. This section authorizes the payment of that debt in the Philippine pesos authorized by the act. That the act applies as well to debts created prior to its passage as to those created after, appears from the proviso. The effect of that proviso is to give the debtor and not the creditor the option as to the kind of money with which the debt shall be paid.<br\/><br\/>The only possible way to avoid the application of this section to the case at bar is by saying that Congress had no power to pass the act and that as to debts created prior to its passage it is therefore null and void. That the act can not be declared void on this ground is well settled by the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. (Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall., 457; Dooley <i>vs.<\/i> Smith, 13 Wall., 604; Railroad Company <i>vs.<\/i> Johnson, 15 Wall., 195; Maryland <i>vs.<\/i> Railroad Company, 22 Wall., 105; and Juilliard <i>vs.<\/i> Greenman, 110 U. S., 421.) In the first four of those cases it was held that debts created when the only legal-tender money was gold and silver could be paid in paper money issued by the Government and which had no intrinsic value.<br\/><br\/>The appellant in his brief discusses at length the meaning of the word \"dollars.\"\u00a0\u00a0 We do not see how such a discussion is material. The contract provides for the payment of \"pesos,\" not \"dollars.\" It is very evident that the contract was not changed nor intended to be changed by the use of the word \"dollars\" in the letter of February 17, 1876. That in English houses especially the word \"dollars\" was, until very recently, used to indicate pesos of local currency, whether Mexican, Spanish, or Hongkong, is well known.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion it may be said that the plaintiff, in 1876, delivered to the defendants the cheapest kind of money then in use. If he had desired to be repaid in the same money which he delivered, he should have so provided ex\u00adpressly in the contract. He had a perfect right to do so, and if he had done so he could now, by reason of the provisions of the said act of Congress, demand payment in gold.<br\/><br\/>That the plaintiff's protest of 1904 was based entirely upon his construction of this act of Congress admits of no doubt; that he believe that by the terms of the contract, without the act of Congress, Smith, Bell &amp; Co. had the right to pay him in silver is beyond question. This belief is shown not only by his letters of protest which expressly refer to the act of Congress as the basis of his claim but also by his conduct during more than twenty-five years in receiving interest in silver without a sign of protest. That he would have received the principal also in silver had the defendants tendered it to him at any time prior to 1903 is also free from doubt. In making his protest in 1904 he evidently believed that the act of Congress required the payment of the 12,000 pesos in gold and that he thereby had acquired additional rights. His construction of the act is, as we have seen, wrong.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Tracey, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<\/div>",

JOAQUIN JARAMILLO, DEFENDANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>WILLARD, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an original action of mandamus brought in this court by the plaintiff against the defendant, who is the registrar of property for the city of Manila. The prayer of the complaint is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That by virtue thereof the petitioner requests the honorable Supreme Court to order the defendant, as registrar of property of this city of Manila, to enter upon the margin of the entry of inscription of the sale with right of repurchase, the marginal note of consolidation in favor of the plaintiff.\"<\/blockquote>The defendant demurred to the complaint and the case is now before us for the resolution of that demurrer.<br\/><br\/>On the 28th of December, 1907, Do\u00f1a Concepcion Perello, the widow and as administratrix of the estate of Don Ramon Pazos y Carballido, sold and conveyed to the plaintiff a tract of land in the city of Manila for the sum of P6,000. The deed of conveyance contained a clause giving the vendor the right to repurchase the property within two years on the payment of P6,000. It provided also that the vendor should remain in possession of the property as tenant of the plaintiff, paying P50 a month as rent therefor, and that she should pay the taxes and insurance and keep the property in repair. The sixth clause of the deed is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Sixth. It is also agreed that in case of the failure for two consecutive months, to pay the rent stipulated, and the nonfulfillment of any of the other obligations to which I bind myself as tenant, in the name of the estate or its successors, the lease shall be considered as terminated, and the period fixed for the repurchase shall be deemed as expired, as if it had really become due.\"<\/blockquote>The vendor did not pay the rent as agreed, nor the taxes, nor the insurance, and the plaintiff commenced an action in the court of a justice of the peace to recover possession of the property. Judgment was entered therein by default on the 26th day of August, 1908. The plaintiff presented a certified copy of this judgment to the registrar of property and asked that he enter upon the margin of the inscription of the deed a note of consolidation. This the registrar refused to do, alleging that the time for the repurchase stipulated in the deed had not expired; that the rental contract was not the object of the original inscription, but rather the deed itself; and that after the deed had been recorded a third person had caused to be recorded an attachment of the interest of the widow in the land, claiming that it was conjugal property.<br\/><br\/>From this ruling of the registrar the plaintiff appealed to the Court of Land Registration in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 700, paragraph 4. That court postponed the decision of the appeal until the decision by this court of a case pending herein which in the view of that court involved the same question. The plaintiff then apparently forsaking his appeal, commenced this original action.<br\/><br\/>Several questions are presented by the record which we do not find it necessary to decide. For example, we are not called upon now to decide the question presented in the Court of Land Registration as to whether Act No. 1108 has repealed those provisions of the Civil Code which relate to conventional repurchase. Nor is it necessary to decide whether the plaintiff, having taken an appeal to the Court of Land Registration, has a right, while that appeal is pending, to institute another independent action of this kind. The case must, in our opinion, be decided upon the ground that mandamus will not lie against the registrar of property to compel him to decide in favor of the plaintiff a question as to whether the right of the vendor to repurchase the property has expired.<br\/><br\/>That the duties of a registrar of property, when he is acting under the Mortgage Law, are to a large extent judicial, is apparent from various provisions of that law, for example articles 18 and 100 and 101, which are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 18. Registers shall determine, under their responsibility, the legality of the documents by virtue of which the record is requested, and the capacity of the parties interested by what appears from said documents.<br\/><br\/>\"All the documents issued by judicial authorities shall also be determined by them under their responsibility and for the sole purpose of admitting, suspending, or refusing their record or entry.<br\/><br\/>\"There shall be no further remedies than those mentioned in this law against the suspension or refusal of a record or cautionary notice, judges or courts by virtue of judicial documents not being permitted to compel the registers in any other manner to record or enter,<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 100. Registers shall determine under their responsibility, the legality of documents by virtue of which cancellation is requested, and the capacity of the parties thereto.<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 101. They shall determine in the same manner documents issued by judicial authorities, for the sole purpose of making' or not making the cancellation of some record in the registry.<br\/><br\/>\"Against these determinations, and those mentioned in the preceding article, the remedies mentioned in article 06 of this law may be taken.\"<\/blockquote>That he is personally responsible for a mistake in his view as to the legal effect of documents presented to him, is apparent from article 313 and the following articles of the law.<br\/><br\/>When the plaintiff requested the registrar to enter this note of consolidation, several questions were presented to the latter for his decision. One was, whether the express provision of the contract, that the vendor should have two years within which to repurchase was modified by the subsequent provision limiting that time in case of failure to pay the rent. Another was whether the evidence presented to him was sufficient to show that the rent had not been paid. The only evidence presented was the judgment of the justice of the peace. That judgment, by the terms of the law, was not conclusive against the vendor. Notwithstanding that judgment, in any further litigation she would be entitled to show, if she could, that as a matter of fact the rent had been paid and that she had not violated any of the conditions of the deed. Other questions might be stated which the registrar was called upon to decide, all of which involved the exercise of his judgment as to the legal effect of the acts and contracts, of the parties.<br\/><br\/>That in such a case as this mandamus will not lie, is well settled. The case of The United States <i>vs.<\/i> The Commissioner (5 Wall., 563), was an action of mandamus brought against the Commissioner of the General Land Office to compel him to issue a patent for certain lands.<br\/><br\/>The Supreme Court of the United States there said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Many of the acts of the parties, and of the officers, the registers, and commissioners of the Land Office, may be valid or void, depending upon the facts and circumstances attending them at the time, and which rest in parol, and are the proper subject of proofs. We have referred to them for the purpose of showing that this case is not one to which the remedy by mandamus can be applied. It calls for the exercise of the judicial functions of the officer, and these of no ordinary character. Indeed, however eminent it is plain no intelligible decision could be made without the aid of facts not within his knowledge, nor attainable by proofs consistent with the proceedings in the case of mandamus. The duty is not merely ministerial, but involves judgment and discretion, which can not be controlled by .this writ.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Merchant <i>vs.<\/i> Del Rosario (4 Phil. Rep., 316) this court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The writ of mandamus can not be used to control the discretion of a judge or to compel him to decide a case or a motion pending before him in a particular way under such circumstances as appear in this case.\"<\/blockquote>In Manotoc <i>vs.<\/i> McMicking (10 Phil. Rep., 119), the court said at page 121:<br\/><blockquote>\"An officer can not be compelled, by means of a writ of mandamus, to perform an act not specially prescribed by the law as one of the duties inherent in his office, and in no case is there any provision of law imposing upon a sheriff the obligation to levy upon a specific piece of property when the writ of attachment issued is in general terms against the property of the debtor.<br\/><br\/>\"Moreover, such an argument contains the defect of taking it for granted that whatever the plaintiff thinks should be attached is really subject to execution, while this question may very well be the object of controversy; and, as a matter of fact, such appears to be the case herein, judging by the various petitions presented by the parties before the filing of the amended complaint. The sheriff may, with more or less reason, believe that the thing in question is exempt from execution, in which case a question of law arises which, by reason of its nature, can not clearly be a matter for the application of the remedy of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">writ of<\/span> <i>mandamus<\/i>.\"<\/blockquote>Neither the vendor of the property nor the person who has attached the interest of the widow therein is a party to this proceeding and any judgment which might be entered herein against the registrar would have no binding effect upon either one of these persons, who are the ones directly interested in the property. Whether in any case mandamus would lie against the registrar of property when he is acting under the Mortgage Law, is a question which we do not decide. We limit our decision to the facts of this case.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer is sustained and the plaintiff is given five days within which to amend his complaint. If no amended complaint is filed in that time, the clerk, without further order of the court, will enter a judgment acquitting the defendant of the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

November, i879; that when he was 8 or 9 years old his lather, the defendant herein, took him to his house where he cared for, nourished,\u00a0 and treated him\u00a0 as his\u00a0 (the defendant's)\u00a0 child, caused him to use his (the defendant's) surname, and also provided for his education from 1890 to 1894; and that during the year last named the plaintiff went to live with his mother, thus quitting his father's\u00a0 side, and concluded by praying that judgment be entered in his favor, compelling the defendant to recognize the plaintiff as his natural son, and granting him any\u00a0 other remedy under the law, with the costs of the proceedings against the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Upon the defendant, Pablo Masecampo, having been duly summoned, his attorney, Hernandez Junquera, appeared and stated in writing that the said defendant had died in the city of Cebu in the early part of November of said year, for which reason he moved that the case be dismissed.<br\/><br\/>In a writing dated November 23, 1905, the attorney for the plaintiff asked the court's permission to\u00a0 continue the action\u00a0 against the heirs or the executor of the\u00a0 deceased defendant in\u00a0 view of the\u00a0 fact that the latter had died a few days after the action was brought.\u00a0 By an order of court of the 4th of December, the hearing on the motion filed by Attorney Junquera was continued to the 9th of December, 1905, and the motion of Attorney Clarin was dismissed for the reason that the heirs or executor of the defendant had not been notified\u00a0 thereof.<br\/><br\/>The hearing of the motion presented by Attorney Junquera, asking that this case be dismissed on account of the death of the defendant, was held on the 9th of December aforesaid.\u00a0 This motion was objected to by Attorney Clarin, and on the 19th of\u00a0 January the\u00a0 court dismissed the motion of the attorney for the plaintiff asking permission to continue the proceedings against the heirs or executors of the deceased, and ordered the case dismissed with the costs against the plaintiff, who, upon receiving notice of the decision, excepted thereto and gave notice of his intention to file a bill of exceptions, which he did, and upon the same having been brought to this court, it has followed the ordinary course.<br\/><br\/>The action brought by the attorney representing Rufo Masecampo is based on the provisions of articles 135 and 137 of the Civil Code, and the demand for recognition was presented\u00a0 at a time when the alleged father, Pablo Masecampo, was still living.\u00a0 The latter was apprised and was summoned by the sheriff in due form, but he was unable to answer the same within the term allowed by law because of his death.<br\/><br\/>The subsequent death of the\u00a0 father is not a bar to the action commenced during his\u00a0 lifetime by\u00a0 one who pretended to be his natural son.\u00a0\u00a0 It may survive against the executor, administrator, or any other legal\u00a0 representative of the testate or intestate succession.<br\/><br\/>The death of the defendant as the natural father, while the action\u00a0 was pending, could\u00a0 not have given rise\u00a0 to\u00a0 or require the dismissal of the complaint, according to the provisions of section 119 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Sec. 11.9.<i> Death of party<\/i>.\u2014In case a party to an action dies while the action is pending, the action shall not abate by reason thereof, but the court on motion may allow the action or proceeding to be continued\u00a0 by or against\u00a0 his executor, administrator, or other legal representative, and the judgment, if it be for the payment of costs and against the executor, administrator, or other legal representative, shall be that he pay in due course of administration: <i>Provided, nevertheless,<\/i> That if\u00a0 the action is for the recovery of money, debt, or damages against the deceased, it shall be discontinued, and the claim thereafter be prosecuted\u00a0 as provided in section six hundred and eighty-six.\"<\/blockquote>Whatever reasons the executor or legal\u00a0 representative of the deceased's succession had for opposing the recognition\u00a0 claimed, the matter must be discussed and decided in a proper action.\u00a0 The exercise of a lawful right before the courts of justice by means of a formal action, terminating in a final decision, can not lawfully be impeded.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing considerations, it is our opinion that the\u00a0 order of the court below dated January 19, 1906, dismissing the complaint, should be reversed, and\u00a0 it\u00a0 is held that the\u00a0 plaintiff is\u00a0 entitled to continue the action already commenced\u00a0 by him in accordance with the provisions\u00a0 of\u00a0 section\u00a0 119\u00a0 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

As to\u00a0 the second error, the appellants set forth\u00a0 that, in the event that the first error is not considered, they request judgment for the defendants for the\u00a0 reason that the evidence taken in the proceedings is perfectly balanced, and\u00a0 it can not be said that\u00a0 the evidence offered by the plaintiff is superior to that of the defendants.<br\/><br\/>As has been seen, the object of the complaint is the recovery of a certain balance of an account due by the defendants to the plaintiff, and notwithstanding the denial of the debtors and their allegation that they had overpaid the said balance, and that, on the contrary, the plaintiff still owed them the sum of P35, the truth is that, in view of the evidence appearing in the record, the\u00a0 certainty of the indebtedness has been fully established, as well as the lack of proof of the payments as alleged by them, from which resulted an excess of P35, which they claim should be\u00a0 refunded to them by the\u00a0 plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The trial court so found when considering that the accounts of the plaintiff were kept\u00a0 in\u00a0 a proper manner; and that the defendants\u00a0 were indebted for\u00a0 the balance claimed.\u00a0 The court found for the plaintiff by reason of the\u00a0 preponderance of the evidence adduced by him\u00a0 in support of the reality and existence of the credit claimed.<br\/><br\/>Section 273 of the Code of Civil\u00a0 Procedure treating of the manner of determining the preponderance\u00a0 of evidence reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"In determining where the preponderance or superior weight of evidence on the issues\u00a0 involved lies, the court may consider all the\u00a0 facts and circumstances of the case, the\u00a0 Witnesses' manner\u00a0 of testifying, their intelligence, their means and opportunity of knowing the facts\u00a0 to which\u00a0 they are testifying, the nature of the facts to which they testify,\u00a0 the probability or improbability of their testimony, their interest or want of\u00a0 interest, and also their personal credibility so far as the same may legitimately appear upon the trial.\u00a0 The court may also consider the number of\u00a0 the witnesses, though the preponderance is not necessarily with the greatest number.\"<\/blockquote>In the complaint, facts demonstrating the existence of the debt claimed were set forth, and during the course\u00a0 of the litigation it was proven by documents and the uncontradicted testimony of proper witnesses that, as a\u00a0 matter of fact, the defendants owed the balance of the account offered in evidence.<br\/><br\/>The defendants in their turn presented in their answer statements tending to demonstrate\u00a0 that such a debt did not exist, and that, on the contrary, they were the creditors of the plaintiff\u00a0 to the extent of ?35 although they have not succeeded in proving that the cost of the goods taken by them was Wholly paid, or that in the last payment made by them, there resulted a balance or excess of 35 in their favor.<br\/><br\/>The allegations of the defendants in their answer, must be assumed to have been denied and refuted at the trial by the plaintiff, inasmuch as they are directly in opposition and contrary to those set forth in the complaint, and because the latter has not been amended as provided by section 104 of the said Code of Procedure, which reads thus:<br\/><blockquote>\"The plaintiff may reply to any new matter or special defense set up in the defendant's answer by an amendment to his complaint, which may be\u00a0 filed as a matter of course and without terms, within a period to be fixed by general\u00a0 rules of court.\u00a0 If the plaintiff does not amend his complaint, as provided in this section, he shall be deemed to have controverted every material\u00a0 statement of the answer.\"<\/blockquote>Taking into consideration the facts that the\u00a0 defendants acknowledge that they have taken goods from the plaintiff,\u00a0 without, however, having duly proven that they had wholly paid the cost thereof, while the plaintiff creditor has on his part proven that from the transactions and accounts between them, there resulted a balance of P969.61\u00a0 riot paid by\u00a0 the defendants; for the above consideration, and in view of the\u00a0 fact that the judgment appealed from is in accordance with the\u00a0 law\u00a0 and the merits of the case, it is our opinion that the same should be and is hereby\u00a0 affirmed with the costs of\u00a0 this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

BERNABE BACHO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\"> The appellant was convicted of the crime of <i>homicidio por imprudencia temeraria<\/i> (homicide resulting from reckless negligence) and sentenced to four months and one day of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>, to pay 1,000 civil damages to the heirs of the deceased, and to the accessory and subsidiary penalties prescribed by law in such cases.<br\/><br\/>The information charges, in substance, that the accused, the chief engineer on board the steamer Carmen which was lying at anchor near Cebu, carelessly and with reckless negligence released the screws which held in place the manhole plate on the steamer's boiler, without taking proper precautions to keep the plate from falling into the boiler; that as a result the plate fell into the boiler, and plunging into the hot water splashed some of it through the manhole so that it fell upon a Chinaman named Chan-Yan, scalding him so severely that he died the following day.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of record discloses that in the usual and proper discharge of his duties as engineer, the accused directed one of his firemen to open the manhole in the boiler on his steamer; that the accused personally superintended the work, and that it was done in accordance with the method usually adopted on board steamers in Philippine waters; that the manhole plate, which is so constructed that it can not be taken off, is held in position by large screws in such manner that when the bolts on these screws are loosened the plate drops into the boiler, unless it be supported by a cord or rope; that under the direction of the accused the plate, which weighed about 20 pounds, was suspended on a rope kept for that purpose; that thereafter the accused and the fireman went about their work in another part of the ship; and that in from one to three minutes, the plate fell into the boiler and splashed the hot water through the manhole on the Chinaman Chan-Yan, who died within twenty-four hours from the effect of the scalds thus inflicted on his person.<br\/><br\/>Except so far as it can be inferred from the fact that the plate fell into the boiler, there is not a particle of evidence which tends to show that in opening the manhole of the boiler the accused was guilty of negligence. On the contrary all the evidence of record tends to prove that he adopted the usual, proper, and necessary method of procedure, and that in opening the manhole at that time and under the conditions then existing he was in the usual and proper performance of his duties as engineer.<br\/><br\/>The evidence throws no light on the true cause of the accident.\u00a0 It may have resulted from a hidden defect in the rope on which the plate was suspended, for which the accused could in no wise be held responsible.\u00a0 It may have resulted from the slipping of one of the knots used by the fireman in tying the ends of the rope on which the plate was suspended, and while it may be admitted that there are cases where it might be the duty of a ship's officer to examine personally a knot tied by a subordinate, where there is reason to believe that a slip resulting from an imperfect tie would endanger the lives or the property of others, nevertheless in a case such as the one under consideration, wherein there was apparently only the most remote possibility of danger resulting from a failure to tie the knot in an absolutely safe and secure manner, we do not think that such extreme diligence could be required.\u00a0 Indeed the usefulness of ship's officers would be dangerously impaired if they were required to give their personal attention to all such petty details, and a ship's officer might well hesitate to take command if he could be held criminally responsible for every accident resulting from the neglect of those under his command.\u00a0 Again, the fall of the plate might have been caused by some mischievous or malicious person, and indeed there is some evidence in the record which suggests this as the true solution of the problem. The rope which the defendant produced at the trial as the one on which the plate was suspended showed evidences of having been cut, and from the description of the boiler and the parts about the manhole, it is difficult to understand how it could have been found in that condition unless some one had deliberately used a knife.\u00a0 We presume it will not be contended, and it was not proven, that it was the duty of the defendant to keep such a strict watch on any particular part of the engine as to make it impossible for a malicious mischievous person to give the rope a cut with a knife, with perhaps no other object than to annoy the engineer by letting the plate fall into the boiler, so that he would be compelled to go in after it.<br\/><br\/>Whatever was the cause of the fall of the plate, we find nothing in the record to indicate that it was due to the negligence or carelessness of the defendant, and on the contrary there is evidence to show that he exercised all the care and took all the precautions required of him in the due performance of his duty.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge seems to have been of opinion that if a rope strong enough had been used, and if the knots had been tied in a proper manner, and if the plate had been properly secured, it could not have fallen, so that there must have been negligence somewhere, and as the defendant was in charge of the work, he should be held responsible. What has been said would seem to be sufficient answer to this reasoning, and it may be added, that in the general experience of mankind, accidents apparently unavoidable and often inexplicable are unfortunately too frequent to permit us to conclude that some one must be criminally liable for negligence in every case where an accident occurs. It is the duty of the prosecution in each case to prove by competent evidence not only the existence of criminal negligence, but that the accused was guilty thereof.<br\/><br\/>The accused produced a rope at the trial which he swore was the rope upon which the plate was suspended, and his statement was corroborated by the fireman; the court, however, refused to believe that this was the very rope used by the defendant, although there was not a. particle of evidence to the contrary. The trial judge found that, since the rope appeared to be so strong that the swinging plate could not have broken it, either this was not the rope used or it must have been already cut at the place where it was supposed to have broken before it was put in use. As we have said, it might have been cut after the plate was suspended, or there might have been a hidden defect in the rope, or so far as appears from the testimony of record, the accident might have resulted from some other cause than the breaking of the rope; and in any event, it is going far to say that, as the accident had occurred, the court would refuse to believe uncontradicted testimony that a certain rope had been used, unless that rope were so weak as to justify a finding of negligence in its use.<br\/><br\/>The accused maintained that before opening the boiler he seat the deceased to work at another part of the ship, and there is some evidence in support of his statement. The prosecution introduced testimony to prove that after the accident, the accused admitted that\u00a0 he had forgotten that the deceased was working near the boiler. We do not think, however, that the point is of special importance, as unless it appeared that the accused was guilty of criminal negligence in the method employed in opening the boiler, we do not think the mere fact that he opened the manhole of the boiler while the deceased was working in the neighborhood constituted such criminal negligence as would sustain the judgment of conviction. The steamer was lying quietly at anchor, and the possibility that the accident by which the deceased, came to his death would occur was so remote that it would be most unreasonable to1 hold him criminally responsible for failing to anticipate it.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed upon the appellant are reversed with the costs in both instances <i>de oficio<\/i>.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

In all cases, to support the offspring.\" Hence the sentence imposing a monthly pension of, 15 for support, the payment being executory, is the subject of this appeal.<br\/><br\/>As to how such\u00a0 pension for support should be paid, according to the provisions of the civil law\u00a0 to which the Penal Code might have referred by\u00a0 its article 449 at the time when\u00a0 it went into force, is shown by two\u00a0 decisions of the supreme court of\u00a0 Spain construing a provision in the law of the<i> Partidas, <\/i>which was the one then in force in matters of support to be furnished\u00a0 by\u00a0 parents to\u00a0 their children.<br\/><br\/>After having been convicted of the crime for which he was sentenced, the accused married another woman.<br\/><br\/>The said high tribunal, in its decision of the 26th of April, 1866, when deciding a case in which the natural father claimed the right to have with him the daughter for whose subsistence he paid a pension, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"First, that Law 3, title 19, of the <i>Partida<\/i> 4, upon determining the cases wherein\u00a0 a\u00a0 father\u00a0 or mother\u00a0 may respectively 'maintain and <i>keep with him<\/i> or her his or her children,' as therein\u00a0 specified, refers\u00a0 to\u00a0 such children as were had in marriage,\u00a0 whatever their age may be, if the marriage is\u00a0 thereafter dissolved for some\u00a0 good reason. Second, that neither\u00a0 the\u00a0 letter nor the spirit of said law can\u00a0 ever apply to natural children, either\u00a0 because the father does not exercise over them parental authority as expressly provided in Law 2, title 17 of said <i>Partida,<\/i> or because there is no legal provision depriving the mother of the care and education of\u00a0 such class of children, or, finally, because it would be contrary\u00a0 to nature to deprive the mother of the favorite\u00a0 object of her maternal love when, through no fault of her own, can the punishment which the law imposes on the woman who gives cause for divorce be inflicted on her.\u00a0 Third, because the father who marries another woman, not the mother of his natural child, creates another obstacle to the exercise of parental authority over his said child.\u00a0 Fourth, a judgment not in conformity\u00a0 with said doctrines would violate the provisions of said Law 5, Title 10, <i>Partida<\/i> 4.\"<\/blockquote>And in the judgment of the 22d of December, 1865, the court decided :<br\/><blockquote>\"First,\u00a0 that where the question of nourishment is\u00a0 complicated with\u00a0 that of the\u00a0 rights of parental authority, it can not alone\u00a0 be decided by laws treating of support, but those which refer to parental authority must also be taken into\u00a0 consideration,\u00a0 because\u00a0 the latter have\u00a0 not\u00a0 been repealed by the former nor are\u00a0 the provisions of the one incompatible with those of the other, notwithstanding the fact that the law referring to the question of nourishment should be enforced in different ways, according to whether or not the children are under the control of the parents. Second, that when the children\u00a0 are not under\u00a0 the control of their parents, as the latter can not designate the place where they should reside, neither can they demand that the children receive support in their house and\u00a0 in their company ; but, when the children are under the control of the parents, both of them have rights which must be respected, unless there should be just cause for withholding them.\"<\/blockquote>The obligation prescribed by article 449\u00a0 of the Penal Code was construed, prior to the enforcement of the Civil Code, in the light of the said doctrines.\u00a0 And after the enforcement of the last-named code it should be construed in a similar manner, because the rule of its article 149 is not absolute.<br\/><br\/>In a case similar to this (with the exception of the conviction in criminal proceedings), a natural father claimed the right to have with him his natural daughter, after marrying a woman other than the mother of said daughter, in order to continue to provide the support, and to the order of the court overruling his request he excepted and alleged that article 149 of the Civil Code had been violated; but the same high tribunal by its decision\u00a0 of December 5, 1903, held:<br\/><blockquote>\"That in accordance with the ruling of the supreme court of Spain in its decisions dated May 11, 1897, November 25, 1899, and July 5, 1901, the option which article 149\u00a0 grants the person obliged to furnish nourishment, between paying the pension fixed or receiving and keeping in his own house the party\u00a0 who is entitled to the same, is not so absolute as to prevent cases being considered wherein, either because this right would be opposed to the exercise of a preferential right or because of the existence of some justifiable cause morally opposed to the removal of the party enjoying the maintenance, the right of selection must be understood as being thereby restricted.<br\/><br\/>\"Whereas the only question discussed in the case which gave rise to this appeal was whether there was any reason to prevent the exercise of the option granted by article 140 of the Civil Code to the person obliged\u00a0 to furnish subsistence, to receive and maintain in his own house the one who is entitled to receive it; and inasmuch as nothing has been alleged or discussed with regard to the parental authority of Pedro Alcantara Calvo, which\u00a0 e has not exercised, and it having been set forth that the natural father simply claims his child for the purpose of thus better attending to her maintenance, no action having been taken by him toward providing the support until, owing to such negligence, the mother was obliged to demand it; it is seen that these circumstances, together with the fact of the marriage of Pedro Alcantara, and that it would be difficult for the mother to maintain relations with\u00a0 her daughter, all constitute an impediment of such a nature as to prevent the exercise of the option in the present case, without prejudice to such decision as may be deemed proper with regard to the other questions previously cited in respect to which no opinion should be expressed at this time.\"<\/blockquote>Therefore, the judgment\u00a0 appealed from is hereby affirmed with costs, and it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

It is\u00a0 therefore unquestionable that he was treacherously killed, and that his assailant attacked him with a dagger and without any risk to himself, as his victim\u00a0 was defenseless ; in this ease such circumstance, in lieu of being merely an\u00a0 aggravating one,\u00a0 should be qualified as one deserving of a heavier penalty than that imposed by the law Mr the crime of homicide, in accordance with the provisions of said article 403 of the\u00a0 Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the denial and the allegations of the accused, as well as the testimony of his witnesses, by which means\u00a0 he\u00a0 endeavored in vain to show his innocence\u2014 that is, that he could not have killed Raymundo Munoz\u2014yet the record contains sufficient and satisfactory evidence of the guilt of the defendant as the only principal, clearly convicted of the murder in question; this because of the fact that, in the presence of the forty to sixty individuals who under his command set out from the\u00a0 pueblo\u00a0 of Abuyog, the accused, after ordering the deceased Munoz to place on the ground the bolo he was using in\u00a0 cutting\u00a0 down bananas, personally approached him and tied him by the elbows with the same rattan that the victim carried, and having thus tied him conducted him to a tree, and, after tearing up his\u00a0 pass, attacked\u00a0 the deceased with a dagger, inflicting on him three most serious and mortal wounds. Mu\u00f1oz did not even attempt to resist the\u00a0 attack because the accused, Tupas, who was the chief of\u00a0 the volunteers, undoubtedly exercised a certain moral control over him and the other men who witnessed the act, and, upon\u00a0 the crime being consummated, he departed with his men, leaving the body of his victim abandoned at the place where the crime had been committed.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of the witnesses offered by the accused, to the effect that they had not seen the deceased during the several days on which the expedition was in the field, nor witnessed his killing by Lorenzo\u00a0 Tupas, who commanded the said expedition, and that they had not seen Ignacio Harquin, one of the volunteers forming part of the same, who, as an eyewitness of the crime, related the facts connected therewith, can not destroy nor weaken the merit of the testimony of the witnesses of the prosecution, because the evidence and other\u00a0 particulars resulting\u00a0 from the case, taken as a whole, incline the mind to grant greater weight to the evidence offered by the prosecution as being more decisive and conclusive, and one is thereby convinced of the guilt of the accused as the author of the murder.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the\u00a0 crime no\u00a0 mitigating nor aggravating\u00a0 circumstance can\u00a0 be considered, inasmuch as the record does\u00a0 not show the character with which the accused was invested as chief of volunteers; therefore, the penalty imposed by the law should be applied in the medium degree.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth, it is our opinion that the judgment\u00a0 reviewed and appealed from should be reversed, and the accused, Lorenzo Tupas,\u00a0 is hereby sentenced to imprisonment for life, which is the medium degree fixed by law, to suffer the accessory penalties of article 54, Nos. 2 and 3, of the Penal Code, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of 1,000 and to pay the costs of both instances.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.J.,\u00a0 Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Willard <\/i>and <i>Tracey, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<\/div>",

<i>fideicomisario<\/i> and administrator of the Carriedo waterworks) as trustee for said\u00a0 works.<br\/><br\/>\"(14) The court erred\u00a0 in giving judgment against defendant and granting execution against its property.\"<\/blockquote>The appellant assigns many errors alleged to have been committed by the lower court.\u00a0 The questions presented by all the said assignments of error are (1) whether or not the present city of Manila is liable under the contracts referred to in the agreed statement of facts, for the obligations created therein by the old city of Manila (<i>Ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i>) as its successor, and (2) if it is, whether the plaintiff is entitled to a writ of execution against any of the property of the present city for the purpose of satisfying that liability when the same has been reduced to a judgment.<br\/><br\/>The lower court held that the present city of Manila was liable upon such contracts, upon the theory\u00a0 that it was the successor of the\u00a0 old city of Manila (<i>Ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i>) as it existed under the Spanish Government.\u00a0\u00a0 The lower court held that the old city of Manila (<i>Ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i>) was the\u00a0 trustee and administrator of\u00a0 the Carriedo waterworks, and as such trustee was responsible for all\u00a0 the debts created or contracted in the administration of such works.\u00a0 This fact is neither admitted nor denied in the agreed statement of facts; neither is there anything in the record which justifies that conclusion.\u00a0 The\u00a0 contracts upon which the plaintiff relies for recovery in no way indicate that\u00a0 the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i> made said contracts as trustee, nor in a representative capacity, but, upon the contrary, the contracts themselves show that they were made by the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i> with the assignor of the present plaintiff simply as the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i> and not as trustee or agent.\u00a0 Gur conclusion is, then, upon this question, that the contract which the assignor of the\u00a0 present plaintiff made with the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i> was made with the old city in its corporate capacity simply and not in a representative capacity as trustee or agent.\u00a0\u00a0 If there has been a violation of the terms of the contract such violation was made by the <i>Ayuntamienio de Manila<\/i> and not by the present city of Manila. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to discuss the relation of trust so ably presented in the briefs of the different attorneys.<br\/><br\/>A municipal corporation is a governmental agent of the state, given authority to govern the people in a limited portion of the state.\u00a0 This power, however, is limited\u00a0 to certain particular governmental functions, which are always expressed in writing in the form of a charter or grant of powers.\u00a0 To ascertain what this power is in each particular case, reference must be\u00a0 made\u00a0 to such grant\u00a0 of powers.\u00a0 Powers not expressly given therein or necessarily implied from such express powers can not he exercised by such governmental agent.<br\/><br\/>Experience has taught nations that when men congregate in large numbers in a small portion of the state, it is convenient to permit such persons, in a limited way, to govern themselves, the state retaining, the authority to modify, enlarge, restrain, or to absolutely revoke such grant of power at any time this convenience ceases.\u00a0 In all cases a municipal corporation is a mere instrumentality of the state for the convenient administration of a local government over limited territory,\u00a0 and as such is vested with subordinate power for local purposes only.\u00a0 The very moment it subverts these powers or arrogates to itself\u00a0 others not granted, or for any other reasons deemed to be sufficient, the\u00a0 state may revoke its authority,\u00a0 dissolve such corporation, and bring all the inhabitants and such property again under the direct control of the state\u00a0 or\u00a0 cental government in all their relations among themselves and with the state.\u00a0 There is no contract between the state and the public that the charter of a\u00a0 city shall not be at all times subject to legislative control.\u00a0 There is no such thing as a vested right held by any individual in the granting of legislative power to municipal corporations.\u00a0 (Meriwetlier <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> Garrett, 102 U.

State, 169; Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, 192, 193.)<br\/><br\/>Many instances might be cited to show where the central government has exercised this prerogative. It being a doctrine well established then that a municipal corporation is a mere agent of the state, what then is the status of said corporation when the state itself is destroyed? Certainly the\u00a0 general consequences of\u00a0 the death of the principal must follow in its effect upon, the authority of the agent.\u00a0 The death of the principal always revokes the agency\u00a0 when there are no vested rights involved.\u00a0 A municipal corporation has no vested right to exist as such.\u00a0 The state may at any time revoke its charter.\u00a0 Of course the state might, by such revocation, incur certain moral\u00a0 obligations, but the performance\u00a0 of these obligations would always rest upon the conscience of the law-making or charter-granting authority of the state.\u00a0 The courts have no equitable or legal authority to compel the state to comply with obligations of this kind in the absence of proper legislation.<br\/><br\/>The principal of the old city of Manila (<i>Ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i>) was the Spanish Government in the Philippine Islands,\u00a0 and when that Government, on the 11th day\u00a0 of April, 1899, at least, ceased to exercise any power or control\u00a0 over this territory (the Philippine Islands), all its agents, including the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i>, also ceased to exist, and therefore this agent was without authority either, to make or to perform contracts.\u00a0 There was no functionary of either Government left with any authority whatever.\u00a0 The Spanish Government, with all its\u00a0 governmental agencies, upon the 11th day of April, 1899, at least, ceased to have or to exercise any functions within the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 Upon that day the people who formerly constituted the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i> became subject to the general laws (not political) applicable to the whole territory and to such rules and\u00a0 regulations as the new authority might see fit to promulgate.\u00a0 After that date all persons who had rights or obligations preexisting\u00a0 against such defunct governments were left to their remedy against such defunct governments, unless such rights were vested rights, or unless by treaty obligations or otherwise the new government had in some way obligated itself to respond to such individuals.\u00a0 It becomes important, therefore,\u00a0 to ascertain whether the new authority has in any way obligated itself to respond to\u00a0 the plaintiff herein.\u00a0 Our attention is called to article 8 of the treaty of Paris.\u00a0\u00a0 But this is a compact between the United States Government and the Crown of Spain, and of course the city of Manila could not, if it would, be obligated by any terms\u00a0 of that compact\u00a0 without an express authorization on the\u00a0 part\u00a0 of the proper power or authority.<br\/><br\/>The city of Manila is in no way the successor of the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i> in law.\u00a0 The mere fact that the present authority in these Islands has given to the present city powers like those exercised by the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i> in no way makes the former the successor of the latter.\u00a0 It is an entirely new organization, a new agent of a new principal, and only has such\u00a0 authority, such powers, and such obligations and responsibilities as the new principal has seen fit to grant and impose.\u00a0 The grant of powers (the Charter of Manila) has been examined in vain to find anything which would make the present city of Manila liable in any way to\u00a0 comply, even though it desired to do so, with the obligations contracted by the <i>Ayuntamiento de Manila<\/i>, and therefore we must hold, as we do hereby, that the present city of Manila is in no wise responsible to the plaintiff upon the contracts made between its assignor and the old city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>These foregoing conclusions do not amount to a denial of the obligations\u00a0 or a refusal to comply with the\u00a0 same. They are simply that the obligations upon which the plaintiff seeks to recover never were incurred by the present city of Manila; neither can the\u00a0 foregoing conclusions be construed to be\u00a0 an attempt to\u00a0 violate the terms of the contracts.\u00a0 They are\u00a0 simply to the\u00a0\u00a0 effect that no contract obligation, with reference to\u00a0 the claim of the plaintiff, ever existed.<br\/><br\/>These conclusions make it unnecessary for us to discuss the second question above suggested, for the reason that the city not being liable upon the contract, no question as to the right to take out a writ of execution against the property of said city can arise in the present case.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the lower court is hereby revoked, and, without any finding\u00a0 as to costs, it is so\u00a0 ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

By reason thereof, he had charge of public funds, and it was his duty to keep his accounts in the official books that were at his disposal, both as municipal treasurer and as deputy provincial treasurer. One of the books under his charge was designated the \"Municipal treasurer's account book,\" in which he was required to enter the receipts and expenditures for account of the municipality, in accordance with the rules and instructions of the Insular Auditor; this book was printed and supplied to municipal treasurers by direction of the Government, and it formed part of the official archives of the municipality.<br\/><br\/>The accused, in the performance of his duties, made on folio 4 of the said municipal cashbook, on the credit side thereof and under date of the 29th of October, 1906, the following entries:<br\/><blockquote><table border=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr valign=\"top\"> <td width=\"70%\">Juan Oquendo, for fees due the justice of the peace for 8 criminal actions .......................................................<\/td> <td width=\"15%\"><div align=\"right\"><br\/>P40.00<\/div><\/td> <td width=\"15%\">\u00a0<\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Amador Barrios, for salary of the municipal employees during the month of October........................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\"><br\/>247.82<\/div><\/td> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Amador Barrios, for salaries of the police force for the month of October .......................................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\"><br\/>162.91<\/div><\/td> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table><\/blockquote>The above amounts were entered in the book as paid when as a matter of fact they had not been paid to the respective parties concerned, because upon inspection by the provincial treasurer, George P. Banner, he discovered that although such entries had been made, the truth was that none of them had been paid, and when the defendant was required to produce the corresponding vouchers for the said month of October, he was unable to do so; the accused then confessed that he had not paid the amounts entered in the book, and this confession was admitted by.him at the trial. Upon further investigation it was ascertained that the accused appropriated to himself and disposed of the said amounts which formed part of a larger sum embezzled by him, according to the balance sheet of accounts made up in December, 1906.<br\/><br\/>A complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal with the Court of First Instance of Capiz, charging Amador Barrios with the crime of falsification of a public document, and the corresponding proceedings were instituted.\u00a0 The court rendered judgment on the 1st of February, 1907, and sentenced the accused as principal in said crime, to the penalty of fourteen years eight months and one day of <i>cadena temporal<\/i>, to suffer the accessory penalties of article 56 of the Penal Code, to pay a fine of 250 pesetas and costs. From this judgment the accused has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The above facts, which have been fully proven in this case, constitute the serious crime of falsification of a public document, defined and penalized by article 300, No. 4, of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the accused, taking advantage of his public office of municipal treasurer of the pueblo of New Washington, and of deputy provincial treas\u00adurer of Capiz, entered in the municipal cashbook certain sums of money as paid to the justice of the peace and to the employees and members of the police force of the town. The fact is, however, that the accused withdrew the said amounts from the municipal safe but never paid them to the persons who were entitled to receive the same; he kept the money and thus perverted the truth when recording the facts in the cashbook, which was of an official or public character.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the fact that the accused pleaded not guilty, his declaration that he failed to pay the said amounts to the justice of the peace and to the employees and policemen of the municipality for their respective salaries for the month of October, 1906, for lack of cash on hand appears of record, and his culpability as the convicted, if not confessed, author of the crime of falsification of a public document has been fully established, for upon an examination of the books under his charge, and a balance of the receipts and expenditures of funds up to the 2d of December of the said year having been made by the provincial treasurer on the above date, it was found that there should have existed the sum of P1,094.90 in favor of the municipality; therefore, if, as confessed by the accused himself, he did not pay the aforesaid amounts to the interested parties, although he entered them as paid in the book, it was not for lack of cash on hand as alleged, but because he had converted the money to his own use and to the prejudice of the municipality and of the officials who were entitled to receive it. The record shows that if there had been no misappropriation there would have been funds more than sufficient for the payment of the above mentioned amounts. An additional entry of P66.66 appears in the cashbook as paid to the municipal president, when in reality he only paid the sum of P34 to Plorencio Melocoton, the said president, who has thus been deprived of P32, about which he said nothing, upon the request of the accused who asked him to wait for a few days, which he did.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime no aggravating or mitigating circumstance is present; therefore the penalty should be imposed, as has been done by the court below, in the medium degree.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth, and considering that the judgment appealed from is in accordance with the law, it is our opinion that the same should be affirmed with the costs of this instance against the accused, provided, however, that the fine to be paid shall be 1,250 pesetas, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, in view of the nature of the main penalty imposed.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

HIGINA SALUD,  DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>WILLARD, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Upon the merits of this case the only question is one of fact, namely, is the boundary line between the land formerly owned by Fidel Salud, the father\u00a0 of the defendant, and land owned by Claro Quison, father and uncle of\u00a0 the plaintiffs, the <i>estero<\/i> or River Nagsaulay, or is it, as found by the court\u00a0 below, a straight line of mango and bamboo trees\u00a0 to the south of the above-mentioned <i> estero?<\/i>\u00a0 The land in controversy is situated\u00a0 between this line\u00a0 of\u00a0 trees and the<i> estero.<\/i><br\/><br\/>That Claro Quison owned land to the north of the <i>estero,<\/i> is undisputed, but the defendant claims that he [Quison] never\u00a0 owned any land south of the <i>estero<\/i>.\u00a0 A large amount of evidence, principally parol, was introduced upon this question, and after an\u00a0 examination thereof, we are satisfied that it clearly preponderates in favor of the decision of the court below, and that it was proven at the trial that the land in question belongs to the heirs of Quison.<br\/><br\/>The defendant relied to a great extent upon the record of an action brought by\u00a0 Claro Quison in 1887 against one Perdeguera.\u00a0 Quison alleged in his complaint in that action that the defendant therein had unlawfully possessed himself of a portion of his, the then plaintiff's land.\u00a0 The land there in question was in the extreme northern part of the land of Quison,\u00a0 and therefore entirely north of the <i>Estero <\/i>Nagsaulay.\u00a0 Judgment was rendered in that action in favor of the plaintiff, and the <i>gobernadorcillo<\/i> of the town of San Juan de Bocboc was ordered to\u00a0 restore the plaintiff to the possession of the land detained by Perdeguera.\u00a0 In executing this judgment the officers of the law apparently gave Quison possession of all the land which he had described in his complaint in that action, which description\u00a0 was as follows; \"On the east, the sea; on the south, land of Fidel Salud; on the west, lands\u00a0 of Juan de Chaves and\u00a0 Camilo Perez;\u00a0 and on\u00a0 the north with the <i>arroyo <\/i>called,\u00a0 Amoyongan.\"\u00a0 Fidel Salud was cited to appear, and did appear when possession\u00a0 was given to Quison.\u00a0 It 'will be noticed that, white the land of Quison is described as being bounded on the south by the property of Salud, nothing is said about the<i> Estero<\/i> Nagsaulay, nor does that <i>estero<\/i> appear upon the plan which accompanied the complaint in that action and which the officers had before them when possession was restored.\u00a0 The minute of the proceeding concerning the restitution\u00a0 was signed by Salud.<br\/><br\/>The importance of these documents for the defendant's case lies in the fact that in them the land is described as being in the barrio of Subuquin.\u00a0 We think the evidence establishes that the land here in controversy is in the barrio of Bataan, and that the dividing line between the barrios of Bataan and Subuquin was the Eiver Nagsaulay, Bataan being to the south of the river and Subuquin to the north, and the argument of the defendant is that, according to these documents, the entire property owned by Claro Quison was situated in Subuquin,\u00a0 and therefore was north of the<i> Estero<\/i> Nagsaulay.<br\/><br\/>Even giving the document all\u00a0 the weight\u00a0 which the defendant claims it is entitled to, it would then\u00a0 be merely evidence upon the question of fact as to whether Quison did or did not own lands to the south of the River Nagsaulay, and as such evidence we think it can not overcome the evidence of the many witnesses presented by the plaintiffs who swore that as a matter of fact, they had occupied and cultivated lands belonging to Glaro Quison situated to the south of this river.\u00a0 It may be, perhaps, that, in view of the fact that the land in controversy in that action commenced in 1887 was a small parcel which itself was in the barrio of Subuquin, in describing the land in question the then plaintiff did not have in mind so much where all of his land\u00a0 lay as where the particular tract then in controversy lay.<br\/><br\/>The defendant also claims that Fidel Salud was given judicial possession of the property here in controversy in 1895. No written documents were presented to prove this possession, but admitting that proceedings relating to judicial possession were then taken in accordance with the provisions of title 13 of the Spanish Law of Civil Procedure,\u00a0 such proceedings could in no way prejudice the plaintiffs according to the express provisions of article 2016.\u00a0 The law did not require for such proceedings the citation of the adjoining proprietors, nor was there any evidence that they were in fact cited in this proceeding, and, according to the testimony of Gregorio de Villa, any possession which Fidel Salud obtained in 1895 was lost in 1901, when Quison again took possession of the premises and held them until the reconcentration when the defendant, in 1903, by reason of such reconcentration again possessed herself\u00a0 of the property.<br\/><br\/>We hold that the finding of the court below in favor of the plaintiffs as to the true boundary line between\u00a0 the respective properties is sustained by the evidence.<br\/><br\/>Some questions of procedure remain to be considered.<br\/><br\/>This action was first brought against Fidel Salud and Gregorio de Villa, the father and husband, respectively, of the defendant Higina Salud.\u00a0 They answered, alleging that the property in question had been conveyed to Higina Salud in 1895, and that she was the only owner thereof. Upon the presentation of this answer, the plaintiffs asked leave to present a supplementary complaint against Higina Salud.\u00a0 The court, in disposing of that motion, ordered the dismissal of the action so far as the defendants Fidel Salud and Gregorio de Villa were concerned, with costs. against the plaintiffs, and permitted the\u00a0 plaintiffs\u00a0 to present a complaint against Higina Salud.\u00a0 The plaintiffs excepted to this order and insisted that the two defendants above-named should be included in the case, but the court refused to vacate his order of dismissal.\u00a0 The plaintiffs then presented a complaint against Higina Salud as the only defendant.\u00a0 She made a\u00a0 motion that the complaint be stricken out, but it does not appear that the court ever made any ruling thereon.\u00a0 She afterwards answered the complaint and the trial was had upon the pleadings then in the case, namely, on the complaint against Higina Salud and her answer.<br\/><br\/>Higina Salud was the only one who appealed from the judgment and she now alleges in her brief that the court erred in dismissing the case as to the other defendants. This dismissal only prejudiced the plaintiffs and they have not appealed.\u00a0 The complaint against Higina Salud was improperly called by the plaintiffs a supplementary complaint.\u00a0 But the name given to it was of no importance. At the time it was presented she was the only defendant. It perhaps was error to permit the\u00a0 filing of that new complaint against Higina Salud in this action and perhaps the complaint should have constituted a new case, but the fact that it was placed among the papers in this case and that the trial and judgment were had and rendered therein, if it were error, was an error which in no way prejudiced the substantial rights of the defendant\u00a0 Higina Salud upon the merits, and is therefore no ground for reversal.\u00a0 (Sec. 503, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>Claro Quison died in 1902.\u00a0 It was proven at the trial that the present plaintiffs are the next of kin and heirs, but it is said by the appellant that they are not entitled to maintain this action because there is no evidence that any proceedings have been taken in court for the settlement of\u00a0 the estate of Claro Quison, and that, without such settlement, the heirs can not maintain this action.\u00a0 There is nothing in this point.\u00a0 As well by the Civil Code as by the Code of Procedure, the title to property owned by a person who dies intestate passes at once to his heirs.\u00a0 Such transmission is, under the\u00a0 present law, subject to\u00a0 the claims of administration and the property may be taken from the heirs for the purposes of paying debts and expenses, but this does not prevent the immediate passage of the title,\u00a0 upon the death of the intestate, from himself to his heirs.\u00a0 Without some showing that a judicial administrator\u00a0 had been appointed in proceedings to settle\u00a0 the estate of Claro Quison, the right of the plaintiffs to maintain this action is established.<br\/><br\/>The court below gave the plaintiffs P900 as damages.\u00a0 While the defendant has assigned this part of the judgment as error in her brief, it has not been argued therein.\u00a0 While it is true that\u00a0 the evidence relating to the damages is in some respects vague and uncertain, yet, after an examination of all of it, we are satisfied that it supports the judgment of the\u00a0 court below, at least to the extent of P900.<br\/><br\/>The appellant finally claims that the action can not be maintained, because some of the plaintiffs are married women whose husbands did not join with\u00a0 them in the action.\u00a0 An examination of the record shows that at least one of the plaintiffs, Lorenza Quison, was a married woman and that her husband did not join with her in the action. Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure is as follows:<br\/><blockquote><i>\"Married woman as a party,<\/i>\u2014When a married woman is a party, her husband must be joined with her, except:<br\/><br\/>\"1. When the action concerns her property, in which her husband can have no interest or\u00a0 right;<br\/><br\/>\"2. When the action\u00a0 is between herself and her husband;<br\/><br\/>\"3. When, for just cause, she is living separate and apart from her husband, or by reason of an agreement in writing entered\u00a0 into between them.<br\/><br\/>\"In either of which cases she may sue or be sued alone.\"<\/blockquote>The action was brought not only to recover the possession\u00a0 of the land and to secure a declaration that the plaintiffs were the owners thereof, but also to recover the sum of P6,720, damages which the plaintiffs have suffered by the wrongful occupation of the land by the defendant. These damages consisted of the products of the land which the defendant had received during the time of such occupation.<br\/><br\/>Passing the question\u00a0 whether, as to the land itself, it being the separate property of the wife, the husband of Lorenza Quison could have any interest or right therein, we think that it is very clear that as to the rents and profits of the land he does necessarily have such an interest or right.\u00a0 The most that can be said in favor of the plaintiffs is that these lands were<i> bienes parafernales.<\/i> In regard to the rents of such lands, articles 1385 and 1401 of the Civil Code provide as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 1385.\u00a0 The fruits of the paraphernal\u00a0 property form\u00a0 a\u00a0 part of the assets of the conjugal partnership, and are liable for the payment of the marriage expenses.<br\/><br\/>\"The property itself also shall be liable, in the case of article 1362, provided that of the husband and the dowry property should be insufficient to cover the liabilities referred to therein.<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 1401. To the\u00a0 conjugal partnership belong:<br\/><br\/>\"1. Property acquired for a valuable consideration during the marriage at the expense of the partnership property,\u00a0 whether the acquisition is made\u00a0 for the partnership or for one of the spouses only.<br\/><br\/>\"2. That obtained by\u00a0 the industry,\u00a0 salaries or work of the spouses or either of them.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 The fruits, income, or\u00a0 interest collected or\u00a0 accrued during the marriage, coming from the partnership property, or from that which belongs to either one of the spouses.\"<\/blockquote>We hold, therefore, that the husband of Lorenza Quison was a\" necessary party to this action.<br\/><br\/>The case was submitted for our decision on the 21st of July, 1908.\u00a0 An examination of the\u00a0 record having disclosed the facts above stated, the court, on the 22d day of August, made an order permitting the plaintiffs, on notice to the adverse party, to move the court for permission to amend the complaint by adding thereto the names of the husbands of those plaintiffs who were married. In accordance with such order, the plaintiffs made a motion that the complaint be amended by adding thereto the names of the husbands of Lorenza Quison, Maximina Quison, Roberta Quison, and Petra Quison as plaintiffs. This motion was argued on the 5th day of October.\u00a0 Plaintiffs rely upon section 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which is in part as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The court shall, in furtherance of justice, and on such terms, if any, as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding and at any stage of the action, in either the Court of First Instance or the Supreme Court, by adding or striking out the name of any party, either plaintiff or defendant, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistaken\u00a0 or inadequate allegation or description in any other respect, so that the actual merits of the controversy may speedily\u00a0 be determined, without regard to technicalities, and in the most expeditious and inexpensive manner.\"<\/blockquote>It will be seen that this case falls directly within the terms of this section.\u00a0 The amendment consisted in adding the names of certain parties as plaintiffs.\u00a0 That amendment is expressly allowed by the section.\u00a0 The motion was made in the Supreme Court.\u00a0 That is also expressly allowed by the section, and if it is ever to be given any effect as applied to the addition of a party to an action, it\u00a0 must cover this case.\u00a0 The provision, moreover, seems to us a very wise one.\u00a0 If it were not allowed, the plaintiffs would either fail entirely in the action or, the present suit would have to be dismissed and\u00a0 they would be compelled to commence another action for\u00a0 the same\u00a0 cause, joining their husbands as plaintiffs, which\u00a0 second action would be but a repetition of the first and would involve both parties, plaintiffs and defendant, in much additional expense and would cause much delay, in that way defeating the purpose of the section, which is\u00a0 expressly stated\u00a0 to be \"that the actual merits of the controversy may speedily be determined without regard to technicalities and in the most expeditious and inexpensive manner.\"<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above stated, the court, on\u00a0 the 5th day of October, made an order stating that on the payment by the plaintiffs of P50 for the benefit of the defendant, the motion would be granted.\u00a0 These terms were imposed upon the plaintiffs for the reason that the attention\u00a0 of their counsel was called to the defect several times in the Court of First Instance and in this court also by the brief of the appellant and that, notwithstanding this fact, he took no steps to correct the error.\u00a0 The plaintiffs have paid into the\u00a0 clerk's office the P50 mentioned\u00a0 in the resolution of October 5, and it is therefore now ordered\u00a0 that the complaint in the action be amended by adding thereto as plaintiffs\u00a0 the names of Santiago Sevilla, husband of Lorenza Quison;\u00a0 Simeon Guerra, husband of Maximina Quison; Dionisio Bravo, husband\u00a0 of Roberta Quison, and Vicente Amador, husband of Petra Quison.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, without costs to\u00a0 either party in this court. So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Tracey, JJ.,<\/i> <\/div>",

Against this ruling of the Collector of Customs the plaintiffs entered a protest, and appealed from the decision of the Collector to the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila.\u00a0 After hearing the evidence, the said Court of First Instance affirmed the ruling of the Collector of Customs, from which decision the plaintiffs appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>The customs authorities classified the importation\u00a0 under paragraph (c) of article 117 of the Customs Tariff Schedule\u00a0 as \"textiles,\u00a0 plain and without figures,\u00a0 stamped\u00a0 or printed, not measuring over one hundred centimeters in width, weighing\u00a0 8 kilograms or more per one hundred square meters, and\u00a0 from 26 to 38 threads net weight,\" and\u00a0 assessed the importation at 18 cents per kilo, plus a surtax of 30 per cent.\u00a0 The plaintiffs contend that the surtax of 30 per cent, under paragraph (g) of said article, was\u00a0 illegally imposed.\u00a0 Article 117 reads as follows<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[2]<\/sup>:<br\/><blockquote>\"117.

FRANCISCO BLANCO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the morning of March 7,1906, Juana Clemente wrote to Magdalena Clemente asking her to take to the house of Dominga Gabriel a pawn ticket issued by the Monte de Piedad in favor of Magdalena, for a diamond ring pawned by the latter with the consent of Juana Clemente who was the owner of the jewel. Juana Clemente left the ticket in the possession of the said Magdalena as security for 350 which Juana owed the latter; the pretext for the request was that some person wanted to buy the ticket. As Magdalena Clemente was unable to take the ticket personally, she sent it by her son, Gerardo Nicolas, and when he arrived at the house, Juana Clemente who lived there asked Gerardo to show the ticket to Silvestre Samonte, the person who wished to buy the same. The moment that Gerardo attempted to hand the ticket to Samonte, Francisco Blanco, who was present, grabbed the ticket and put it in his pocket, and showed Gerardo a badge, stating that he was a detective, and asked him if he wanted to go to Bilibid. As Gerardo, notwithstanding his fear, still claimed and tried to recover the ticket that was taken from him, the accused, Blanco, and Juana Clemente promised him that the latter would pay the claim of his mother as soon as the pledged ring was redeemed and sold. Gerardo, being from the provinces and somewhat scared, accepted the promise which, however, was not fulfilled because, after the ring had been redeemed by Blanco with money that Juana Clemente had given him, he kept said ring in order to pay himself the sum of P600 which Juana Clemente owed him for his services.<br\/><br\/>On the 14th of April, 1906, Juana Clemente filed a complaint charging Francisco Blanco with <i>estafa<\/i>, but upon request of the assistant prosecuting attorney the court dismissed the complaint <br\/><br\/>On the 26th of June, 1906, without prejudice to the accused being held in detention to answer a charge of robbery.<br\/><br\/>On the 26th of said month an information was filed by Gerardo Nicolas charging the said Blanco with the crime of robbery; the proceedings were thereupon instituted. A demurrer was interposed by the defense but was overruled, and the court rendered judgment on the 15th of August, 1906, sentencing the accused to the penalty of three years eight months and one day of imprisonment, to refund to Magdalena Clemente the sum of P200, or suffer subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs. From this judgment counsel for the accused has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The above related facts, clearly proven by the testimony of eyewitnesses, certainly constitute the crime of robbery, defined and penalized under articles 502 and 503, No. 5, of the Penal Code; the pawn ticket in question was made out in favor of Magdalena Clemente for the sum of P200, for which a ring of greater value had been pledged; the ticket was snatched from the hands of her son and agent, Gerardo Nicolas, and besides the force and violence employed when the bearer of the document tried to recover it from the possession of the person who had forcibly taken it away, the defendant resorted to intimidation in order to prevent the recovery of the stolen document.<br\/><br\/>The substantial difference between robbery and theft consists of the characteristic circumstance that, in the former, violence or intimidation is employed toward the person, or force upon the thing itself; in the latter no such moans are employed. Finally, since the intent to obtain gain must necessarily exist, and this being the idea that moves the agent to commit the above crimes, premeditation, which is a circumstance inherent in this class of crimes, does not increase the liability of the author thereof.<br\/><br\/>The accused Francisco Blanco is the only proven principal, liable by direct participation, and fully convicted of the commission of the crime before us, for, notwithstanding his plea of not guilty and exculpatory allegations, the records of the case establish his guilt as the author of the robbery in question.<br\/><br\/>The record shows that there was not only premeditation but an actual conspiracy to deprive Magdalena Clemente of the pawn ticket representing a jewel of great value. The document in question was delivered to her by Juana Clemente, the owner of the jewel, as security for the sum of P350 which the latter owed her; the creditor, Magdalena, refused to surrender the ticket as long as Juana did not pay the debt and of this fact Francisco Blanco who was the attorney in fact and agent of the debtor, Juana Clemente, was fully aware; Blanco and Juana then acted together, and Juana wrote to Magdalena asking her to produce the ticket at the house where she lived, on the pretext that there was a person who wanted to buy the pledged jewel; for this purpose they induced Silvestre Samonte to appear as the intending buyer, and when everybody was present in the house they invited Gerardo Nicolas, who was sent by his mother with the ticket, to show the same to the supposed buyer; thereupon the accused, Blanco, grabbed it from the messenger's hands, put it into his own pocket immediately, and then intimidated the bearer of the ticket who, notwithstanding his fear, objected and demanded from the accused the return thereof. Gerardo Nicolas, as a native of Malolos, Iiulacan, and therefore a stranger in this city, did not persist in his claim fearing that the defendant was really a police agent and that he could send him to Bilibid; he had simply come to Manila to fulfill the request of his mother who, in consequence of the act committed by the accused, with premeditation and in conspiracy with Juana Clemente, the debtor, was unlawfully deprived of the possession of the pawn ticket, which she kept as security for her credit against the owner of the pledged jewel.<br\/><br\/>On account of the desire to collect a certain sum that Juana Clemente owed him, the accused conceived the criminal intent to secure the pawn ticket, which was in the possession of Magdalena Clemente as security for her credit, and in carrying out the plan, even though he acted with the consent of the owner of the jewel, he violated the penal law and committed the crime of robbery, because he was aware that the creditor, Magdalena Clemente, had refused to deliver the ticket unless Juana Clemente previously paid her the P350; and in order to carry out the attempt he arranged, with premeditation, the stratagem above related, taking advantage of the occasion when Gerardo Nicolas was showing the ticket to Silvestre Samonte; he obtained the ticket forcibly, and furthermore resorted to intimidation when the return of the stolen document was demanded of him.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime no aggravating nor mitigating circumstance is present, and for this reason the penalty imposed by the court below, in the judgment appealed from, is in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed with the costs of this instance, provided, however, that the penalty imposed shall be that of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">presidio correccional<\/span>, with the accessory penalties of article 58 of the code.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Rep., 551.\u00a0 Reference is thereto made for a statement of facts. Upon the new trial the evidence was directed to the two points mentioned in the former opinion, namely, the rights which Tan Tongco had in the property when the plaintiff's attachment was levied and whether he had 16st the rights which he then had.<br\/><br\/>It was proven that Tan Tongco and Agustina\u00a0 Brillo hare been husband and wife for more than eighteen years; that when she made the contract of lease for the property in question with the defendant, and when she constructed the house, she was the wife of Tan Tongco.\u00a0 By the provisions of article 1407 of the Civil\u00a0 Code both the contract of lease and the house were presumptively the property\u00a0 of the conjugal partnership.\u00a0 (Alfonso <i>vs.<\/i> Natividad, 6 Phil. Rep., 240; Lim <i>vs.<\/i> Garcia, 7 Phil. Rep., 320; Leonardo <i>vs.<\/i> Santiago, 7 Phil. Rep., 401.)<br\/><br\/>To overcome the presumption established by said article 1407, the defendant introduced in evidence the\u00a0 permit given by the city authorities for the construction of the building.\u00a0 This was given to Agustina Brillo.\u00a0 It is very apparent that this in no way tends to prove that she constructed the building with her own money.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant also introduced in evidence a notarial\u00a0 act dated the 7th of November, 1902, wherein Agustina Brillo stated that she had leased the land from the defendant; that she had erected a house thereon with her own\u00a0 money;\u00a0 that the house and the land constituted two separate properties; and that this statement was made for the purpose of securing the inscription of the house as her property in the registry of property.\u00a0 The defendant proved that the house was so inscribed.\u00a0 The only thing in\u00a0 this notarial document which has any bearing upon the case is the statement contained therein that the wife constructed the house with her own money.\u00a0 This statement, made out\u00a0 of court by a person not a party to the action, can not under any circumstances prejudice the plaintiff.\u00a0 As to him it\u00a0 was incompetent evidence.\u00a0 The defendant should have called Agustina Brillo as witness to prove by her testimony at the trial that her money went into the construction of the house.<br\/><br\/>No evidence other than these documents was produced by the defendant, and it is very apparent that the presumption established by article 1407 was not overcome.<br\/><br\/>Both the leasehold interest and the house itself were therefore, when the plaintiff's attachment was levied, the property of the conjugal partnership and, as such property, it was liable for\u00a0 the debts of the husband.\u00a0 (Art 1408, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Upon the second question, as to whether the rights of Tan Tongco and his wife in the lease of the property had ceased, the only evidence presented by the defendant was his own testimony that, when he bought the house of the receiver, he deducted from\u00a0 the price the rent then due. This is no evidence that the rights of the lessees had been terminated.\u00a0 It simply proved that they had paid\u00a0 the rent then 'owing by them.<br\/><br\/>The leasehold interest and the house being the property of the conjugal partnership at the time the plaintiff's attachment was levied, and being subject to the debts of the husband, it follows as a necessary consequence\u00a0 that the plaintiff, by the sale under execution on the 28th day of May, 1904, acquired air the interests of Tan Tongco and his wife in that property, subject to redemption as provided by law, and we so declare.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff in his complaint asks for different kinds of relief, but the only relief to which we think he is entitled is the declaration which we have just made and the right to have his certificate of sale filed in the office of the registrar of deeds.<br\/><br\/>The Code of Procedure relating to the sale of real property on execution provides that when a sale is made, the officer must give the purchaser\u00a0 a certificate of sale.\u00a0 It then provides that \"a duplicate of such certificate must be filed by the officer in the office of the\u00a0 registrar of land titles of the province.\"\u00a0 Without considering what the\u00a0 rule might be if the Mortgage Law had remained intact, it is very\u00a0 apparent that,\u00a0 by virtue of the provisions of this section 463, the purchaser is entitled to have his certificate filed in the office of the registrar of titles.\u00a0 It probably would be the duty of the registrar upon such filing to make a marginal note thereof upon the records relating to this property.<br\/><br\/>That part of the relief asked which relates to the cancellation of the deed\u00a0 made by the receiver in favor of the defendant can not be granted.\u00a0 The only document which the plaintiff has is this certificate of sale.\u00a0 By the provisions of section 465 of the code, the land was subject\u00a0 to redemption at any time within one\u00a0 year from the date of the sale, and this certificate itself so states.\u00a0 The law provides, in section 466 and other sections,\u00a0 that, after the time for redemption\u00a0 has expired and there has been no redemption, the officer shall execute a deed of the property. It; is apparent\u00a0 from these provisions of the law that\u00a0 this certificate is merely provisional.\u00a0 If the land is redeemed, the purchaser receives his\u00a0 money and the certificate becomes of no value.\u00a0\u00a0 If the land is not redeemed, the purchaser secures\u00a0 a\u00a0 deed from the sheriff, which constitutes his muniment of title.\u00a0 In this case there is no evidence to show whether the land has or has not been redeemed, and no evidence to show that any deed has ever been executed by the sheriff.\u00a0 It is apparent that in no event could the deed of the defendant be canceled if in fact he had redeemed the property from the sale.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the case remanded to that court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, with costs, declaring that the plaintiff,\u00a0 by\u00a0 the sale under execution, acquired all the interests of Tan Tongco and his wife in the leasehold and the house in question, and that such leasehold interest at the time of the sale still existed, and declaring further that the plaintiff is entitled to have the certificate of sale filed in the\u00a0 office of the registrar of titles of the city of Manila.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

said indorsement was made at Iloilo on the 15th of June, 1900, and the defendant, who consented thereto, was notified of the same; that some time in 1901 the plaintiff wrote a letter to the defendant informing him that the aforesaid document of indebtedness executed by him to Ramirez had been\u00a0 indorsed by the latter to him (the plaintiff), and that in consequence thereof he requested him to pay the said debt of 400 pesos and 25 centimos; in answer to said request the defendant wrote a\u00a0 letter acknowledging his indebtedness and obligation. and engaging to pay the same.<br\/><br\/>Since that time, however, and notwithstanding having been requested several times, it is further alleged that the defendant instead of making payment has sought to evade it, asking for extensions and further extensions, and for this reason the creditor was obliged to file a complaint against him in the court of the justice of the peace of the provincial capital, and that, as the result of such action, judgment was rendered therein sentencing the defendant, Rodriguez, to pay the amount due by him; from said judgment he appealed to the Court of First Instance before which the former complaint was reproduced.<br\/><br\/>Upon the overruling of the demurrer filed by the defendant, to which he excepted, he, in answer to the complaint, stated\u00a0 in writing, on the 30th of January,\u00a0 1906, that as a matter of fact he had executed the document in question to the amount of 400 pesos and 25\u00a0 centimos in favor\u00a0 of Regino Ramirez, but denied all and every one of the allegations contained in paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of the complaint, and in his defense alleged that said document was executed by the defendant as security\u00a0 for the accounts\u00a0 which said Fray Lesmes Perez had with the aforesaid Ramirez, who indorsed them upon the agreed condition\u00a0 to return such moneys as should be collected from said Fray Lesmes on the 15th of\u00a0 May, 1899,\u00a0 or\u00a0 to return\u00a0 the accounts if uneollected in\u00a0 order to exchange them\u00a0 for the document\u00a0 in question signed by the defendant, which\u00a0 exchange was not carried out notwithstanding the fact that the accounts were not collected, on account of reasons for which he was not to blame; and that at the time when the supposed obligation was executed, and\u00a0 when it\u00a0 became due and was indorsed,\u00a0 both\u00a0 the plaintiff and\u00a0 the defendant were merchants, such as they are now, as is also the supposed original creditor, Regino Ramirez; that the aforesaid document was issued by reason of a mercantile transaction and intended for\u00a0 mercantile purposes also; hence, that the subject thereof is a mercantile transaction, and that the right of the plaintiff, if any, had prescribed prior to the time when the original complaint was filed with the court of the justice of\u00a0 the peace; therefore, in conclusion he asked\u00a0 that\u00a0 the complaint be dismissed and\u00a0 the plaintiff sentenced to pay\u00a0 the costs, and\u00a0 prayed for\u00a0 such further relief as might be considered just and equitable.<br\/><br\/>Upon the trial of the case evidence was adduced by both parties, the documents exhibited were made of record, and on the 16th of November, 1906, judgment was entered sentencing Jose Rodriguez to pay Juan Azarraga the sum of 400 pesos and 25 centimos in local currency at the rate ruling on the day of payment, with legal interest thereon from May 15, 1899, and to pay the costs of the proceeding.\u00a0 To said judgment the defendant excepted and moved for a new trial on\u00a0 the ground\u00a0 that the findings of fact were openly and manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence, and because the sentence was contrary to law; the motion being overruled, the petitioner excepted, and upon proper bill of\u00a0 exceptions having been presented, the\u00a0 case\u00a0 was submitted to this court on appeal.<br\/><br\/>The document marked \"A,\" signed by the defendant, and which states the obligation contracted\u00a0 by him\u00a0 reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The undersigned hereby engages to pay Sr. Regino Ramirez, a merchant of this place, on the 15th day of May of the coming year 1899, the 400.25 pesos, four hundred peso's and twenty-five centimos,\u00a0 which Fr. Lesmes Perez appears to owe him under the document indorsed in my favor on\u00a0 this date.\u00a0 Capiz, December 31, 1898.\u2014Jose Rodriguez.\"\u00a0 Rubricated.<\/blockquote>On the back of the foregoing document appears a note which reads thus:<br\/><blockquote>\"I hereby indorse in favor of Sr. D. Juan Azarraga the above-stated amount.\u00a0 Iloilo, June 15, 1901.\u2014Regino Ramirez.\" Rubricated.<\/blockquote>The obligation constituted\u00a0 by the aforementioned document in favor of Regino Ramirez\u00a0 and transferred, according to the note indorsed thereon, to Juan Azarraga, is what the law classifies as due on a day certain, referred to in article 1125 of the Civil Code, which reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Obligations, the fulfillment of which has been fixed for a day certain, shall only be demandable when the proper day arrives.<br\/><br\/>\"A day certain is understood to be one which must necessarily arrive, even though its\u00a0 date be unknown. <br\/><br\/>\"If the uncertainty should consist in the arrival or nonarrival of the day,\u00a0 the obligation\u00a0 is conditional and shall be governed by the rules of the preceding Section.\"<\/blockquote>At the time when the complaint was filed with the court of the justice of the peace, the date fixed for the fulfillment of the obligation, namely, the 15th of May, 1899, had long since passed without the obligated party, Rodriguez, having paid Azarraga,\u00a0 the transferee, the 400.25 pesos which, under the said document of indebtedness, he had engaged to pay, notwithstanding the fact that he Was informed of the cession or transfer thereof, and demand had been\u00a0 made upon him therefor.\u00a0 And, furthermore, as alleged, after the defendant bad\u00a0 been sentenced by the justice of the peace to pay the said amount, he, without legal reasons, and with excessive temerity, still ventured to appeal in a second and third instance, with the evident\u00a0 intent to evade the fulfillment of a valid obligation, the date for the payment of which was overdue and payment therefore demandable,\u00a0 inasmuch as the defendant can be compelled to pay the said amount.<br\/><br\/>Of the two exceptions taken by the defendant to the claim of the creditor the first consists in\u00a0 that, according to his own opinion, said obligation is a conditional one. Such an allegation can not be\u00a0 admitted under the law because in\u00a0 said document of indebtedness accepted by Rodriguez, no condition whatever is\u00a0 present, not even\u00a0 that which is pretended in the answer,\u00a0 and since the terms of the obligation due on a fixed date are clear, the plain meaning of the wording of said document must be abided by, as it would not be lawful to consider as included therein things and conditions other than such as were intended by the parties concerned when executing the contract, and which appear therein.\u00a0 (Arts. 1281, 1283, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Neither does the condition alleged by the\u00a0 defendant appear in the letter which the original creditor, Ramirez, addressed to the plaintiff, Inclosing the said document of indebtedness with his indorsement\u00a0 thereon; and upon the defendant debtor having been notified\u00a0 of the transfer by Ramirez, as advised by the latter in his letter to Azarraga, the transferee, and when the said debtor wrote to the latter stating his\u00a0 willingness to pay and\u00a0 acknowledging\u00a0 that, owing to the delay, the transferee was subjected to heavy loss,\u00a0 he makes no mention of any\u00a0 condition whatever as having been agreed to when the document of indebtedness was executed.<br\/><br\/>In the aforesaid document marked \"A\" reference is made to the documents exhibited by the defendant under Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, in the first of which there is a statement of the account of Fr. Lesmes\u00a0 Perez with Regino Ramirez, the creditor, where the total\u00a0 amount is the same as that stated in the document marked \"A,\" and in which appears a note of \"pay to the order of Rodriguez,\" the defendant, as\u00a0 he himself affirms in said document \"A\"\u00a0 executed by Rodriguez on the 31st of December, 1898, at which time the indorsement was drawn up on said account No. 1 by Ramirez, the creditor.<br\/><br\/>The transaction carried out is logical and perfectly legal; if by reason\u00a0 of the transfer Rodriguez became the owner of the credit of 400.25 pesos held by Ramirez against Fr. Lesmes, it is proper that he should in turn execute in favor of the assigning creditor\u00a0 a document whereby he bound himself to pay the amount transferred on a certain date; said credit was subsequently transferred to the plaintiff, a transfer of rights authorized by article 1112 of the Civil Code, and furthermore involving a novation of the original obligation, Rodriguez substituting the debtor, Fr.\u00a0 Lesmes Perez, and subrogating Azarraga to Ramirez, the original creditor.\u00a0 (Arts. 1203, 1205, 1212, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The mere declaration of the defendant, lacking as it does the least justification, does not constitute any proof tending to show the existence of the alleged condition, nor can it lessen the value of the document of indebtedness signed by him in favor of Ramirez, whose indorsement or transfer to the plaintiff he was unable to deny; on the contrary, he had to admit it as a fact and that it was in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>If we were to seek for the reason why Rodriguez executed said obligation to pay the debt of Fr. Lesmes Perez, it will be seen that the same is explained in the document marked \"D,\" signed by the defendant, Rodriguez;\u00a0 said document shows in a conclusive manner that accounts were pending between Pr. Lesmes Perez and Jose Rodriguez, or, as said document states, the latter owed the former 1,983.75 pesos, and on this supposition it is not strange that Rodriguez engaged to pay Ramirez what Fr. Lesmes owed him, in order to afterwards deduct whatever was paid to Ramirez\u00a0 from the larger claim which Fr.\u00a0 Lesmes Perez had against him.<br\/><br\/>The other exception of the defendant consists in that the document marked \"A\" is of a mercantile nature; therefore, that the action commenced by the plaintiff, based on the obligation stated therein, had prescribed even before the filing of the complaint for the enforcement thereof with the court of the justice of the peace of Capiz, because the transaction referred to in said document between the parties appearing in the same, who were merchants, was a mercantile transaction.<br\/><br\/>It has not been proved that the claim of Ramirez against Fr. Lesmes arose from mercantile operations,\u00a0 nor that the obligation contracted\u00a0 by Rodriguez, in favor of the first named, originated\u00a0 from an act of commerce and\u00a0 for mercantile purposes; neither does the said document appear as having been issued payable to order as required by articles 311 and 532 of the Code of Commerce; for said reason the document marked \"A\" is not of a mercantile character, and its nature and conditions are subject to the provisions of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>On this supposition, and touching the validity of the action brought for the enforcement of the obligation\u00a0 contracted by Rodriguez in said document, the law applicable to the question as to whether or not the same had prescribed is not article 950 of the Code of Commerce, which fixes the short term of three years, but article 1964 of the Civil Code, which grants the long\u00a0 period of fifteen years\u00a0 from the time when the obligation became due, which was on the 15th of May,\u00a0 1899.\u00a0 And even though section 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure were applicable herein, the action taken by the plaintiff for the recovery of his credit could not be considered to have prescribed for the reason that ten years have not transpired.<br\/><br\/>As for the rest, the assignment or transfer of the credit in question, made by Ramirez, the creditor, is perfectly valid, and notwithstanding the fact that the cause or consideration for the transfer is not stated in the indorsement, it must be presumed that one exists and that it is a lawful one, unless the debtor should prove the contrary, which\u00a0 he has not done in this case.\u00a0\u00a0 (Arts. 1274, 1277, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>With reference to the lack of a documentary stamp on the document of indebtedness, the decree of May 10, 1886, and the instructions for its application do not declare the nullity of any document unprovided with such stamp;\u00a0 it limits itself, by\u00a0 article 82 thereof,\u00a0 to imposing a\u00a0 fine on whoever should violate the decree\u00a0 by executing and issuing a document\u00a0 without a proper stamp.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, and adopting the conclusions stated\u00a0 in the judgment appealed from, it is our opinion that the same should be affirmed with costs against the appellant, provided, however, that the defendant, Jose Rodriguez, shall pay legal interest from the time when the complaint was filed with the\u00a0 court of the justice of the peace, and it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellao,\u00a0 C.

The accused, Emiliano Aronce, entered the apartment, opened and abstracted from a locked wardrobe a lady's gold watch, valued at P15, and a gilt necklace and charm valued at P4; both articles were the property of the said Olivares, who woke up as the thief was leaving; she only saw him from behind as he, passed through the street door, to which she followed him; she was unable to pursue him out in the street however, because she was in dishabille, but immediately after she dressed and tried to find the thief, but he was no longer to be seen. Olivares made inquiries of Vicente Testa, who was working in a hat store on the opposite side of the street, and the latter told her that there was yet time for her to go after the individual, as he had only just left the said <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">entresuelo<\/span>. The aggrieved woman then noticed that her wardrobe was open and that the watch and chain were missing; she reported it at once to her husband who in turn informed the police of what had taken place. Detective George Hartpence recovered the stolen watch and chain from the pawn shop in charge of Leocadio Clemente; the initials D. A. R were engraved on the inside of the watch case, and the watch, as well as the chain, was recognized by Leoncia Olivares as her property.<br\/><br\/>For said reason a complaint was filed by the prosecuting attorney for the city of Manila, charging Emiliano Aronce with the crime of robbery committed in an inhabited house, and the corresponding proceedings were begun. On the 16th of May, 1908, the trial judge sentenced the accused to the penalty of three years, six months, and twenty-one days imprisonment and costs, and from the said judgment the accused has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The above-stated facts, which have been fully proven, constitute the crime of theft, and not robbery, as stated in the complaint, inasmuch as the accused managed to enter the dwelling of the injured parties and steal the watch and chain without the employment of any of the means enumerated in article 508 of the Penal Code; he did not enter the habitation of Leoncia Olivares and her husband, Pablo Partosa, on the afternoon of May 29, 1907, forcibly, or by breaking through a wall, roof, floor, door, or window, but entered it by doors that were open, or that were not locked or secured with a bolt; neither did he enter the house under a false name, or feigning to be a person in authority or an agent of one; he did not break open doors, wardrobes, coffers, or other furniture or locked or sealed objects, nor did he make use of false keys, picklocks, or other similar instruments in order to open the wardrobe where the said watch and chain were kept. The injured parties did not find that the doors or the lock of their wardrobe had been forced or broken, but simply that the door was open, with the bolt of the lock sticking out, and, according to the woman, in order to open the wardrobe it was sufficient to have pushed or pulled the door.\u00a0 For this reason the accused can not be punished in accordance with article 508, paragraph 4, of the Penal Code.\u00a0 Article 517 of the said code provides that\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"The following are guilty of theft:<br\/><br\/>\"1. Those who, with intent of gain and without violence or intimidation against the person or force against things, shall take another's personal property without the owner's consent.\"<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<\/div><\/blockquote>The abstraction of the said watch and chain, effected by the opening of the door of the wardrobe containing them by means of the slight movement necessary to pull it open, shows that the said wardrobe was not well secured by its lock, so that he did not make noise enough to awake the woman; such an operation does not constitute the force that characterizes robbery, inasmuch as it does not appear that the door of the wardrobe or its lock was fractured, or opened by the use of a false key or picklock; therefore, the theft does not fall within the provisions of the code on the subject of the crime of robbery, but within the provisions of article 517 hereinbefore inserted defining the crime of theft, because the thief obtained the stolen property without employing force or violence with respect to the said wardrobe.<br\/><br\/>The guilt of the accused has been clearly demonstrated in the proceedings, because, notwithstanding the fact that he pleaded not guilty, and his exculpatory allegation that at the time the crime was committed he was at San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan, an alibi which has not been proven in the case, the proofs submitted by the prosecution produce in the mind the fullest conviction of the guilt of the culprit as being the author of the theft herein prosecuted; and as a matter of fact, not only was he recognized by Vicente Testa, a neighbor of the aggrieved woman who saw the accused enter the house and also a few minutes later when he went out running and laughing pursued by the woman who, on reaching the street door through which the thief had passed told the said witness that the individual who had just left had stolen her watch.\u00a0 The woman was unable to continue the pursuit of the defendant because she was not properly dressed; the said neighbor, Testa, recognized the accused as the person who entered and a few minutes later left the said house, because the witness noticed, that the defendant, prior to entering the house, was looking at him, and he in turn kept his eye on the accused; for this reason it must be believed that, when Testa designated him at the trial of the case, it was due to the fact that he had clearly recognized him on the afternoon of the affair.<br\/><br\/>It has likewise been proven in the case that, immediately after perpetrating the theft, the accused went to Calle Azcarraga, to the pawn shop of Filomena Concepcion where he gave the name of Antonio Reyes and as residing in Calle Ilaya, Tondo, and obtained P7 by pledging the watch and chain. Owing to the address given, the police were able to arrest the accused, Emiliano Aronce, who was already known to them; he really lived in Calle Ilaya, and after his arrest he was recognized by the witness Vicenta Testa and picked out from among: nine other individuals placed in line. Detective George Hartpence testified that, according to particulars kept in his office, the accused had been several times in Bilibid Prison and in proof of his statement produced the document marked Exhibit C, in which it appears that the accused has been nine times in jail, once for gambling, another for vagrancy, the third time for disturbing public order, and six other times for petty larceny, theft, or robbery.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime, the presence of the aggravating circumstances of its perpetration in the dwelling of the aggrieved parties, and the fact that the accused has been more than twice convicted for other crimes comprised within title 23 [13] of the Penal Code, which deals with attempts against property, without any mitigating circumstance to counteract the effects of the said aggravating ones; for this reason, and taking into account the value of the watch and chain, which exceeds 25 pesetas but is less then 250, the crime is included in article 518,\u00a0 paragraph 4, of the Penal Code; but, on account of the circumstance above alluded to, that the accused has been sentenced several times for crimes committed against property, and the fact that he has been more than twice convicted, the penalty incurred by him is the one immediately higher in grade to that of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> imposed by No. 4 of the said article 518, in accordance with the provisions of article 520 of the Penal Code. The penalty immediately higher in grade to that of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>, according to the gradual scale of penalties enumerated in articles 88 and 91 of the said code, is <i>presidio correccional<\/i>, and by reason of the presence of aggravating circumstance 20 of article 10, without any mitigating circumstance, the penalty that should be imposed on him is that of <i>presidio correccional<\/i> in its maximum degree.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and Emiliano Aronce should be and is hereby sentenced, as principal of the crime of theft, to the penalty of four years, two months, and one day of <i>presidio correccional<\/i>, to the accessory penalties of article 58 of the code, and to pay the costs of both instances.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Willard,<\/i> and <i>Tracey, JJ.<\/i>, concur. <\/div>",

Then each of the robbers attacked one of the prisoners, two of whom, Pablo Garcia and Gaspar Marquez, were killed outright, while Marcelo Agan and Francisco Galves were left lying on the ground, the first altogether unconscious with bolo wounds in his neck, shoulders, and back. He swears that when given them he was\u00a0 sitting\u00a0 down manacled and that they were inflicted upon him by\u00a0 the accused alone, whom he thoroughly identified, having theretofore known him as a man who hired out his beast of burden for transportation to the Tabacalera Company, and\u00a0 who lived in the same region as himself.<br\/><br\/>In the face of the specific relation of the two surviving victims, Agan and Galves, the pretense of the accused that he was present at the robbery and murder under compulsion, having been summoned by the robbers from his house to act as their guide, can not be credited.<br\/><br\/>This is a case where the murder was\u00a0 perpetrated at a place different from that of the robbery and\u00a0 after\u00a0 an appreciable interval of time. Yet, both transactions being part of the general plan and, the object of the murders being in furtherance of the robbery, by doing away with the witnesses to it, the entire transaction is considered as constituting the crime of robbery with homicide.

Rep., 1.)<br\/><br\/>It appears from the testimony that each of the robbers dealt only with his particular victim, so that this accused did not assault either of the men who died.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the murders\u00a0 having been in furtherance of the common plan, in which he participated, he is responsible for them. (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Santos, 4 Phil.

DIONISIO CHANCO,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><i>\"Judge of First Instance.\"<\/i><\/div><\/blockquote>On the 22d of the month of May following, Brigida applied for the execution of and compliance with the provisions of the above order.\u00a0 On the 17th of June of the same year, Guinablay prayed the court that the former partition be annulled, that another one be ordered,\u00a0 and that other commissioners be named to investigate the condition, extent and other circumstances of the\u00a0 lands belonging to the estate, and to this end she presented an itemized statement of the difference between the two shares in order to show that, while the share adjudicated to Juana amounted to P1,364 that allotted to Immin was only Pl,275.<br\/><br\/>Upon the hearing of said petitions, the court, by a decree dated the 7th of October, 1907, sustained its former order of April 30, 1907.<br\/><br\/>Guinablay appealed from the order of October 7, 1907, and submitted the following assignment of errors:<br\/><br\/>(1) The court erred in stating in its order of April 30, 1907, that, before proceeding to the partition, the commissioners had complied with the formalities provided by the law.<br\/><br\/>(2) The court erred in considering\u00a0 that the partition made by the commissioners is just and equitable.\u00a0\u00a0 (The order already quoted.)<br\/><br\/>(3) The court erred in approving\u00a0 and ratifying\u00a0 the partition made by the commissioners. (Referring to\u00a0 the same\u00a0 order.)<br\/><br\/>(4) The court erred in denying the petition of the appellant Guinablay, praying for the revocation of the order of the 30th of April.<br\/><br\/>The first error assigned can not be sustained, because, the commissioners\u00a0 having asserted\u00a0 in\u00a0 their report that all the formalities required by the law had been complied with before proceeding with the partition, and no proof to\u00a0 the contrary having been offered in the lower court, with the exception of a mere allegation that the partition was prejudicial to the rights of\u00a0 one of the heirs, the presumption mentioned in subdivision 31 of section 334 of the Code of Civil Procedure must be taken for granted.<br\/><br\/>Nor can the second error be sustained since, with but a slight difference of P2.25, which could be paid in cash, the shares are equal.\u00a0 If any injustice results, it\u00a0 is not to the prejudice of the children of the deceased, but to his widow, Brigida, to whom the petitioner herein, by\u00a0 her first petition for the granting of letters of administration of the estate, conceded the right\u00a0 to a portion of the inheritance, which has not been satisfied by the partition made. By\u00a0 her writing of July 6, 1905, the petitioner\u00a0 stated \"that the nearest relations and in consequence\u00a0 the heirs of the deceased are <i>Brigida, his widow<\/i>, a resident of the <i>rancheria<\/i> (settlement) of Brandrell,\u00a0 and the two mentioned children, Immin and Juana.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (P. 2 of brief.)<br\/><br\/>Neither has the court committed the third error assigned by the appellant, for it must not be overlooked that no objection was made in the\u00a0 court below, nor proof offered in support of the allegation, presented for\u00a0 the first time in this appeal, that the appellant was not duly summoned nor heard in the court below.\u00a0 No\u00a0 allegation in regard to this was set up in the writing of Guinablay dated June 17, 1907, and no objection of this tenor was discussed at the trial.<br\/><br\/>The fourth error, in that the court denied the motion of the appellant Guinablay for the annulment of the order of April 30, 1907,\u00a0 can not be sustained either as to its form or the grounds on which it is based.\u00a0 Not as regards its\u00a0 form, because the order of April 30, 1907, was issued to approve the partition, and, according to section 782 of the Code of Civil Procedure was appealable within twenty days; and not as regards the ground of said error assigned, for there appears no proof offered\u00a0 during the trial\u00a0 of the case to show the difference\u00a0 between the two shares of the estate, a difference between the two amounts of P1,364 and P1,275, consisting of P89, according to the itemized statement submitted by the counsel for appellant.<br\/><br\/>The only proof presented at the trial in support of this question is a document in the Ilocano dialect, subscribed and sworn to by Roman Abayon, one of the commissioners appointed to appraise the estate, who stated therein that he can neither read nor write beyond writing his own name; that the other commissioner set down the amounts, but that he could not say whether or not the amounts given by him were put down; and that the value of the lands of the estate was calculated from the maps alone as they did not make a personal inspection of said lands.\u00a0 This document was signed by Abayon on the 17th, the date of the trial.<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as no proof in regard to this matter has been offered, other than said document, the court in denying the motion for the annulment of the order of April 30, 1907, acted within the law.<br\/><br\/>We hereby affirm the order appealed from of October 7, 1907, with the costs of this\u00a0 instance\u00a0 against the\u00a0 appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Carson, Willard,<\/i> and <i>Tracey, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<\/div>",

Peterson, as sheriff of the city of Manila, to recover the possession of certain personal property, more particularly described on pages 4, 5, and 6 of the record of the lower court, or P1,500, the value of the same, and also to recover the sum of P2,500 as damages for the wrongful withholding of the said property.<br\/><br\/>On the 18th day of August, 1903, the defendant, James J. Peterson, filed an answer to the complaint of the plaintiffs and, among other things, alleged that one Joseph H. Hartman was the owner of the property in question and denied that the plaintiffs were the owners thereof.<br\/><br\/>On the 3d day of November, 1903, the defendant, the First National Bank of Hawaii, intervened in said cause, alleging that the property in question was the property of the said Joseph H. Hartman, and also prayed for a judgment against the plaintiffs for $135.25, United States currency, as damages and also the sum of $902.87, United States currency, with interest at the rate of 8 per cent from the 12th day of July, 1903.<br\/><br\/>On the 9th day of November, 1903, the plaintiffs filed a demurrer to the answer of the First National Bank of Hawaii.<br\/><br\/>On the 16th day of November, 1903, the judge of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila overruled the said demurrer and after hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of said cause, on the 14th day of December, 1903, filed a decision in said cause, in which he made the following findings of fact:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. The plaintiff is a. corporation duly organized under the laws of the Philippine Islands, and doing business in the city of Manila;<br\/><br\/>\"2. On the 10th day of June, 1903, one J. H. Hartman, being the owner of a saloon and fixtures, consisting of the property set forth in the inventory in the sheriff's return, on pages 4, 5, and 6 of this record, and being indebted to the plaintiffs in this action, executed to the plaintiffs a bill of sale, a copy of which is set forth on page 38 of the record in this case, as security for the indebtedness of said Hartman to the plaintiffs and the responsibilities which the plaintiffs had assumed in behalf of the said J. H. Hartman;<br\/><br\/>\"3. The defendant is the duly appointed and acting sheriff of the city of Manila, and on the 10th day of June, 1903, in a certain action, No. 1817, pending in the Court of First Instance, wherein the Pacific and Oriental Trading Company was plaintiff and the said J. H. Hartman was defendant, did seize and attach the property set forth in said sheriff's return hereinbefore mentioned, pursuant to an order of attachment duly issued in said action, No. 1817;<br\/><br\/>\"4. That thereupon the plaintiffs, in order to protect their interests in said property, as security for the claim which they had against said J. H, Hartman, caused said attachment to be released, and paid the claim of the plaintiff in said action, No. 1817;<br\/><br\/>\"5. That on the 29th day of June, 1903,, the First National Bank of Hawaii commenced an action in the Court of First Instance for the city of Manila against said J. H. Hartman, to recover money for a debt, and on the said date the sheriff of Manila duly attached and seized the property hereinbefore mentioned, pursuant to an order of attach\u00adment issued in said cause, as the property of said J. H. Hartman, and that the plaintiffs herein had knowledge of said attachment proceedings;<br\/><br\/>\"6. That on the 3d day of July, 1903, the plaintiffs herein claimed to be the owners of the property hereinbefore mentioned, and to be entitled to the possession thereof, and demanded of the defendant, as sheriff of the city of Manila, possession of the said property, pursuant to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure;<br\/><br\/>\"7. That thereupon the defendant, as sheriff of the city of Manila, on the 6th day of July, 1903, delivered to the plaintiffs, C. Heinszen &amp; Co., said property above described;<br\/><br\/>\"8. That thereafter, on the 7th day of July, 1903, an alias order of attachment was issued in cause No. 1928, in the Court of First Instance for the city of Manila, First National Bank of Hawaii <i>vs.<\/i> J. H. Hartman, and the defendant, as sheriff of the city of Manila, again seized and took possession of the property hereinbefore mentioned and in controversy in this suit;<br\/><br\/>\"9. That on the 7th day of July, 1903, the said J. H. Hartman executed to the plaintiffs in this case a new bill of sale for the property hereinbefore mentioned, and it is a controverted fact whether this second bill of sale was executed prior to or after the alias writ of attachment had been executed upon the property in question.\"<\/blockquote>From the record it appears that sometime prior to the, 10th day of June, 1903, the Pacific and Oriental Trading Company commenced an action against the said J. H. Hartman for the purpose of recovering the sum of money due the former from the latter, by virtue of which action the plaintiff secured an attachment against the property of the said Hartman, which property is admitted to be the same property enumerated on pages 4, 5, and 6 of the record in the present cause. In order to relieve the property of the said Hartman from said attachment, the plaintiffs herein executed and delivered a bond to the said Pacific and Oriental Trading Company, guaranteeing the payment of the indebtedness due from Hartman to said company. The record discloses that the said Hartman was also indebted to the plaintiffs herein at that time in a certain sum of money, Heinszen &amp; Co., the plaintiffs herein, in order to secure themselves against loss by virtue of the said bond as well as to secure payment of the indebtedness of Hartman to them, obtain from the said Hartman on the 10th day of June, 1903, the following contract or bill of sale:<br\/><blockquote>\"Know all men by these presents: That I, J. H. Hartman, of Manila, P. I,, for and in consideration of the sum of three thousand dollars ($3,000), local currency, and the signing of a bond for one thousand two hundred dollars ($1,200), United States currency, in the case of The Pacific and Oriental Trading Company <i>vs.<\/i> J.

I. <\/span><br\/><\/div><br\/>\"Commission expires January 1, 1905.\"<\/blockquote>It is admitted in the record that the said Hartman was permitted to continue in the possession and control of said property, notwithstanding this alleged bill of sale executed by him to the plaintiffs herein on said 10th day of June, 1903. The record also discloses that the said Hartman was in possession of the property in question at the time of the attachment in favor of the First National Bank of Hawaii of the same property by the sheriff of the city of Manila on the 29th day of June, 1903. The record also discloses that the plaintiffs herein made due demand upon the sheriff for the possession of the property in question, in accordance with section 442 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, on the 2d day of July, 1903, and that the said sheriff, bv reason of the failure of the said First National Bank to execute and deliver to the said sheriff a forthcoming bond, as provided for in said section, delivered the property in question to the plaintiffs herein on the 6th day of July, 1903, and that the plaintiffs herein took possession of said property on said date. The record also discloses that on the 7th day of July, 1903, the said First National Bank of Hawaii obtained from the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila another attachment, which was served by the sheriff of the city of Manila upon the property in question after the same had been delivered, as above indicated, to the plaintiffs herein.<br\/><br\/>The contention of the plaintiffs herein is that by virtue of the said contract of the 10th day of June, 1903, and by virtue of the fact that they obtained possession of said property on the 6th day of July, 1903, they had a preferred right to the property in question, and that the attachments of the First National Bank of Hawaii on the 7th day of July, 1903, created no preferred rights in favor of the said bank as against the said property over that of the plaintiffs herein.<br\/><br\/>Certainly the plaintiffs obtained no preferred rights over the property in question by virtue of said contract of June 10, 1903, at that time for the reason that they did not take possession of said property.\u00a0 (Art. 1863 of the Civil Code.) Moreover, we are of the opinion that the plaintiffs, under said contract, might at any time, by virtue of said contract, complete the pledge by obtaining the actual possession of said property. It will be noted, however, that the sale of the said Hartman to the plaintiffs was a conditional one, and that whenever the plaintiffs herein attempted to enforce the conditions of said sale they were obligated by the conditions imposed therein.<br\/><br\/>The record discloses that upon the 7th day of July the said Hartman attempted to make another bill of sale of the property in question to the plaintiffs herein. The record does not fully disclose whether this second bill of sale was made before or after the attachment of the same date in favor of the First National Bank of Hawaii. There is no doubt, however, that the plaintiffs herein had taken possession of the said property on the 6th day of July and thereby had completed the pledge of said property under and by virtue of the contract of the 10th day of June. At the time the plaintiffs herein took possession of said property, thereby completing their pledge on the 6th day of July, there was no lien or attachment upon said property other than that of the said plaintiffs. There is no question raised in the record with reference to the consideration between the plaintiffs herein and the said Hartman for the contract of June 10.<br\/><br\/>The decision of this question depends upon the question as to whether the contract of pledge, entered into by and between the plaintiffs herein and the said Hartman, made by the latter to the former, coupled with the fact that the plaintiffs herein obtained possession of said property at a time when no other liens existed against it, gave the plaintiffs a preferred right over the said property. If this question is answered in the affirmative, then the property could not have been legally levied upon by the sheriff at the request of the defendant, the said First National Bank of Hawaii. (Arts. 1921 and 1922, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The contract of June 10, coupled with the actual possession of the property on the part of the plaintiffs herein, complies with all the requisites provided for in article 1857 of the Civil Code. The contract, therefore, together with the possession of the property, was a perfect contract of pledge under said article 1857 and article 1863 of said code. (Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino <i>vs.<\/i> Peterson, 7 Phil. Rep., 409.) It was not proven that the said contract of June 10 and the possession of July 6 were in any way fraudulent. The indebtedness existing between the plaintiffs herein and the said Hart man, mentioned in said contract, was not denied.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion, therefore, and so hold, that the plaintiffs herein are entitled to the possession of the property in question in accordance with the terms of the contract of June 10, 1903, and the proceeds thereof must be applied in accordance with the terms of said contract, and if, after the disposition of said property, there is anything remaining in favor of the said Hartman, such surplus may be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.<br\/><br\/>Therefore the decision of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Carson, Willard, <\/i>and <i>Tracey, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<\/div>",

The vendor, Juan Ellazar, original owner of the land, being present when the measurements were\u00a0 made, stated that the true boundary line of the said land toward the north, setting out from the northeast corner at\u00a0 a distance of 1 meter and\u00a0 85 centimeters to the east of\u00a0 the fence, to the northwest corner at a distance1 of 4 meters to the east of the fence, runs in a curved line which was designated at the request of Justo Siping; the measurement\u00a0 making use of the meter used\u00a0 by the vendor at the time of the sale of the land gives 54 meters and 10 centimeters on the northern and 33 meters and 75 centimeters on\u00a0 the southern side from the\u00a0 southeast to\u00a0 the southwest corner.<br\/><br\/>\"Third.\u00a0 The purchaser, Angel Cacob, objected to the use of the met car submitted by the vendor, Juan Ellazar,\u00a0 stating that it was not the true meter used when Ellazar sold the said land to the purchaser; he said, furthermore, that the meter used by the commissioners in case 1 is the same as the meter measure preserved by the purchaser since the time when lie bought the land.<br\/><br\/>\"This is all which, in\u00a0 honor\u00a0 of\u00a0 truth, your\u00a0 commissioners\u00a0 have to report.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"Respectfully,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MARCELIXO SIPING,<br\/><\/div><div style=\"margin-left: 400px; text-align: right;\"><i>\"Justice of the Peace.<\/i><br\/><\/div><br\/>\"I do not\u00a0 approve of No. 2, because the\u00a0 meter used is too short and is illegal.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"PEDRO E.

EL CHINO DIEVAS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the 17th of September, 1906, Modesto Acuna Co Chongco filed a written complaint against a Chinaman named Dievas, setting forth that in consideration of services rendered to him by the defendant, both as a clerk in his store and as his representative in his sugar business, the said Dievas allowed him a share in the profits of his said business, and that on several occasions he had paid him certain sums which were charged to the account of the profits due the said defendant when the yearly account was made up; that when the sums taken by the defendant from the plaintiff were liquidated on the 22d of April, 1905, it was found that they amounted to P5,579.36, which amount was debited to the defendant; that, nevertheless, on balancing the accounts of his store and of the sugar business in the same year, the sum of P2,619.78 was found to be the share of the defendant as profits, which amount was credited to his account, and must be deducted from said debt; that if certain pieces of lumber, valued at P1,050.75, were taken for account of the plaintiff, he in exchange paid the defendant the sum of P408.40, besides several bills due by the defendant for goods and cash received by the latter from the Chinamen Yap Tico and Cuan Chong as specified in the attached account, according to which the defendant is still indebted to him in the sum of P2,694.89 and interest thereon which should be at the same rate as paid by the plaintiff to his creditors, that is, 15 per cent per annum; therefore, he prayed that judgment be entered sentencing the defendant, the Chinaman Dievas, to pay him the sum of P2,694.89 with interest thereon, at the rate of 15 per cent per annum from the date of the complaint, together with costs and damages.<br\/><br\/>By a writing dated October 15, 1906, the defendant prayed the court to order the plaintiff to specify: (1) the date of the commencement of the copartnership between the plaintiff and the defendant, and that of its dissolution, (2) the share of the defendant in the profits of the copartnership.<br\/><br\/>In deciding this motion the court below dismissed the petition of the defendant as to the first specification for the reason that such copartnership had never existed, and the defendant could not lie considered as a partner; and, as to the second, ordered the plaintiff to state the share that the defendant was entitled to in the profits of the business. The defendant excepted to the first part of this ruling, and the plaintiff, in compliance with the second part, stated that until January, 1901, the defendant had not been allowed any share in his business, but that, on the other hand, the plaintiff had let him have certain amounts of money for his own private business, without however participating therein; and that since February of said year, the plaintiff assigned to the defendant three of the thirteen parts into which the profits of the plaintiff's general business was divided, and asked that his previous statement at the hearing of the motion be considered as withdrawn and substituted by the explanation contained in his writing of the 1st of December, 1906.<br\/><br\/>In his amended answer of the 12th of February, 1907, the defendant set forth: that he denied all the allegations of the complaint, and as special defense alleged that, from October, 1894, until February or April, 1905, the defendant had been representing the plaintiff in the sugar' business in which the latter was engaged in said city; that when the business was first commenced, it was agreed upon between them that the defendant should receive one-half of the profits, but that after the balance of accounts made in 1901, it was stipulated between them that from that time forward, the defendant should receive only one-third of the profits as his share, for the reason that Chinaman Lam Pin had commenced to participate in the business; that during the time in which the defendant managed the plaintiff's business, the accounts were balanced four times, that is in the years 1900, 1901, 1903, and 1905, and that, according to said balances, the business yielded a1 profit of P36,040 during the period from 1894 to 1900; P8,900 from 1900 to 1901, P10,060 from 1901 to 1903; and P9,000 from 1903 to 1905; that the defendant had not drawn more than P10,500 on account of his share in the profits, there remaining\" in consequence a balance of P18,323.33 standing in his favor.<br\/><br\/>As a counterclaim he alleged: that the plaintiff is indebted to him in the sum of P18,323.33 as balance in his favor for his share in the profits of the said business; that for several pieces of lumber mentioned in the complaint, the plaintiff owes him the sum of P1,050.75; and that the amounts stated in the counterclaim have not been paid him up to this date; therefore, he prayed the court below to dismiss the complaint, and render judgment sentencing the plaintiff to pay P19,374.08, with legal interest thereon from the date of the original answer, and the costs of the proceedings.<br\/><br\/>At the trial, evidence was adduced by the parties to the suit and their exhibits were made of record. The court below rendered judgment on the 12th of September, 1907, absolving the defendant from payment of the debt claimed, and sentencing the plaintiff to pay the defendant the sum of P1,050.75, with legal interest thereon from February 12, 1907, the date of the counterclaim, without special ruling as to costs. Against said decision both parties to the suit took exception and moved for a new trial on the ground that the conclusions contained in the judgment were manifestly and openly contrary to the weight of the evidence; the motion was overruled by the court to which overruling both the plaintiff and defendant excepted; the latter presented the corresponding bill of exceptions which, as agreed upon between the parties, is also to be considered as the bill of exceptions of both parties, for the reason that the attorney Hilado had engaged to prepare the said bill and present it as if it came from both parties who had duly excepted to the judgment, according to a resolution of the Tribunal dated July 14, 1908, by virtue of a motion made in this court by attorney at law Ledesma.<br\/><br\/>The matter at issue is the collection of certain sums which the parties claim from each other, in the sense that each is the creditor of the other as a result of accounts existing between them.<br\/><br\/>From a careful examination of the allegations of both the plaintiff and the defendant, and from the evidence adduced by them, we are of the opinion that the conclusions set forth by the trial judge in the judgment appealed from, with the exception of those relative to certain amounts set out in the special account of the defendant marked Exhibit C, are in accordance with the law and the evidence because at the time when the judicial resolution was entered the clear provisions of section 273 of the Code of Civil Procedure were undoubtedly taken into consideration.<br\/><br\/>In the record it is clearly shown that the plaintiff owes the defendant P1,050.75, the value of lumber which he obtained from the latter, as acknowledged by the plaintiff himself, and considered by the trial judge when sentencing him to the payment thereof.<br\/><br\/>It is true that the said amount appears in the account Exhibit A to the credit of the defendant, but it is none the less true that the latter denied said account together with the first debit entry of P5,579.36; in view of the lack of sufficient proof there is no way under the law to consider said amount as a lawful debt of the defendant Dievas, and, in consequence, that the price of the lumber had been paid him.<br\/><br\/>In the aforesaid account, Exhibit A, it is stated that the defendant owes the plaintiff Co Chonco the said amount by reason,of the sums furnished him by the latter as shown by the liquidation made on the 22d of April, 1905; but neither the payment of these amounts nor their purpose and respective dates appear to be proven, nor does the concurrence of the debtor with said liquidation appear, inasmuch as the evidence adduced by the plaintiff, besides being contradictory, does not establish the reality and certitude of the said debit item of P5,579.36, and consequently of the balance of his account, which is the debt claimed.<br\/><br\/>The other debit items of the said account, Exhibit A, are the same which appear in the itemized account of Dievas in his relations with the plaintiff shown in the original and its translation marked as Exhibit C. This last account, differing from the one marked as Exhibit B, which includes the liquidation of the plaintiff's business, is a special account, kept by the plaintiff in the name of the defendant, of his transactions with him, and in view of the fact that the items in said special account, together with the balance of P754.94 in favor of the plaintiff, were not positively impugned or denied by the defendant debtor when the account was presented to him in the presence of his lawyer, and that the declarations of some of the witnesses for the plaintiff confirm, although without marked precision, the certainty of the indebtedness, one acquires the conviction that the debit and credit entries in the said special account are correct, and that the defendant Dievas is really indebted to the plaintiff, Co Chongco, for the aforesaid balance of P754.94.<br\/><br\/>The sum of P2,200 which Dievas owed Co Chongco in 1900 and which was remitted by the latter by way of gratification for the services that Dievas rendered the creditor prior to the year 1901, is an anterior debt entirely independent of the sums and the balance shown in the said special account, marked Exhibit C.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, admitting that the two respective credits of P1,050.75 of defendant Dievas, and that of P754.94 of the plaintiff, the only ones which as the object of complaint and counterclaim have been considered as proven, legally exist, inasmuch as the rest of the sum of P18,323.33 debit balance which, according to the defendant the plaintiff owed him as part of the profits in the sugar business claimed by him in his counterclaim, has not been in any way proven, the finding of the court with respect to the larger amount counterclaimed is in accordance with the law ;hence, it is proper to consider that both credits have been offset, because both conform to the conditions required by the law for a set-off. The articles of the Civil Code bearing on this matter are:<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 1195. Compensation [set-off] shall take place when two persons in their own right are mutually creditors and debtors of each other.<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 1196. In order that compensation may be proper, it is required:<br\/><br\/>\"1. That each of the persons bound should be so principally, and that he be at the same time the principal creditor of the other.<br\/><br\/>\"2. That both debts consist of a sum of money or, when the things due are perishable, that they be of the same kind and also of the same quality, if the latter should have been stipulated.<br\/><br\/>\"3. That both debts be due.<br\/><br\/>\"4. That they be determined and demandable.<br\/><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 1202. The effect of compensation is to extinguish both debts to the concurrent amount, even when the creditors and debtors have no knowledge thereof.\"<\/blockquote>Compensation being therefore made between both credits, the one and the other become of course extinguished in the concurrent amount, and defendant Dievas is still entitled to recover the difference, that is, the sum of P295.81.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, it is our opinion that it should be held, and we hereby hold, that the credit of P754.94 of the plaintiff Modesto Acu\u00f1a Co Chongco, and that of P1,050.75 of the defendant Chinaman Dievas, should be set off against each other; the said Modesto Co Chongco is sentenced to pay to the said Dievas the sum of P295.81, with legal interest thereon from February 12, 1907; both parties are absolved from the payment of the remaining amounts mutually claimed in the complaint and counterclaim, without any special ruling as to costs. The judgment appealed from is affirmed in so far as it agrees with this decision.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Beech against the Hon. A. S. Crossfield, judge of First Instance of the city of Manila, and Juana Jimenez, in case No. 4690, hereby resolves that the defendant judge be directed to forward at once to this court all the proceedings had in case No. 2655 of the said lower court, with respect to the legalization of the will and testament of the late Policarpo Gaerlan, as well as those in case No. 5816 of the said court entitled 'Teodoro M. Beech, plaintiff, <i>vs.<\/i> Juana Jimenez and Francisco Limcuando, defendants,' in order that the same may be reviewed by this court, and that the said judge be ordered to refrain from all further action in the ejectment proceedings in case No. 5816, and the testamentary proceedings in case No. 2655, in everything that affects or may affect the rights of the plaintiff, Teodoro M. Beech.\" <\/blockquote>Both records having been duly forwarded, the appeal was heard on the 23d instant; the counsel for both parties were present, and it appears from their arguments: That the judgment rendered in the ejectment proceeding No. 5816, which gave rise to the appeal, contains the following orders: (<i>a<\/i>) Let judgment be entered in favor of the plain tiff, Teodoro M. Beech, and against the defendants Juana Jimenez and Francisco Limcuando, for the recovery of possession of the property described herein (the description then follows); (<i>b<\/i>) that the defendants be ejected from the same, and for the costs of the action, provided, that the possession shall not be given, nor the ejectment take place before the 15th day of May, 1908, and that in the meantime the defendants, or any of them, may repurchase the said property by paying over to the plaintiff, or to the court, the sum of P6,000, and the further sum of P50 per month,\u00a0 commencing with the month of June, 1907,\u00a0 until the time of payment; and (<i>c<\/i>) in case of repurchase, the note of consolidation entered in the registry of property by the plaintiff shall be annulled.<br\/><br\/>This judgment was rendered on the 27th of March, 1908,\u00a0 and as it was dictated on an appeal from a decision of the justice of the peace of Manila, there could be no further appeal therefrom, and proceedings in certiorari were interposed on the 14th of April, 1908.<br\/><br\/>From the above three orders in the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila, the first, and a portion of the second, to wit: the finding in favor of Teodoro M. Beech and against the defendants Juana Jimenez and Francisco Limcuando for the recovery of possession of the two properties in question, and that the defendants be ejected therefrom with the costs of this action, give rise to no appeal whatever; but the second and third are appealable, inasmuch as by the second the execution of the ejectment is postponed until the 15th day of May, 1908, and in the meantime it authorizes the defendants, or any of them, to repurchase the properties by paying to the plaintiff, or to the court below, the sum of P6,000 and that of P50 per month, commencing with the month of June, 1907, until payment is effected, and because, by the third finding, it is ordered that, in case the said repurchase is made, the note of consolidation entered in the registry of property by the plaintiff shall be annulled. It is alleged that the court below has exceeded its jurisdiction in the above two orders. The findings of fact contained in the said judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila are the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. That on the 25th day of July, 1903, one Policarpo Gaerlan, now deceased, and Francisco Limcuando, sold two parcels of real estate, one pertaining to the former and the second to the latter, to Saturnina Salazar under <i>pacto de retro,<\/i> with the right to repurchase within two years; that this period was extended for two years, so that the time finally expired on July 25, 1907;<br\/><br\/>\"2. That the properties were sold for the sum of P5,000, and afterwards the said Policarpo Gaerlan received an additional P1,000 from the said Saturnina Salazar on December 4, 1903, by means of a document executed between both parties and which was made a part of the former sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"3. That the real estate thus sold continued in the possession of the vendors, who remained in possession thereof as tenants, agreeing to pay the sum of P50 per month (it should be added that this amount was later increased to P60 per month); that the rent was paid up to the month of June, 1907, but not being paid on that date an action was brought for the ejectment of the defendants as tenants, and for the recovery of the unpaid rent.<br\/><br\/>\"4. That the said Saturnina Salazar transferred the said real estate to the plaintiff herein, Teodoro M. Beech, and that no notice of this transfer of title was given either to the deceased Policarpo Gaerlan, or to his representatives after his death;<br\/><br\/>\"5. That the defendant Juana Jimenez, as administratrix of the estate of Policarpo Gaerlan, essayed to redeem that parcel of real estate which her husband had sold in July, 1907, and which was then in possession of the plaintiff, but the defendant Francisco Limcuando, the owner of the other parcel, refused to join in the repurchase, so the defendant Juana Jimenez, as administratrix, tendered what she deemed a proportional amount in order to repurchase the lot which her husband had sold; the plaintiff refused to accept it and resell a portion of the property, insisting that, if either were redeemed, both should be;<br\/><br\/>\"6. That the defendant Juana Jimenez then increased the offer which she had theretofore made for the repurchase of the real estate sold by said Policarpo Gaerlan, and on the 25th day of July, 1907, offered the plaintiff P5,000, which the plaintiff refused to accept; in the meantime she had filed a request with the court to fix in the testamentary proceedings the amount necessary to be paid to repurchase the land in question, and of the filing of this instance the plaintiff had notice prior to the expiration of the term of the right to repurchase, under the <i>pacto de retro<\/i>;<br\/><br\/>\"7. That finally, a day or two after the time for repurchase had expired, the defendant Juana Jimenez offered the plaintiff the whole amount of the <i>pacto de retro,<\/i> but the plaintiff refused, alleging that he had already consolidated the title by making the proper marginal notation in the registry of property;<br\/><br\/>\"8. That the rent for the property sold has not been paid since and including the month of June.\"<\/blockquote>The conclusions of law of the court below are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"First. That the plaintiff was not obliged to resell a part only of the real estate purchased, but was entitled to demand the redemption of the whole or none;<br\/><br\/>\"Second. That the defendant Juana Jimenez did not make a tender of the whole purchase price until after the period for repurchase had expired, but not having been notified of the transfer of the property, and having made diligent effort in the administration of the estate to pay the amount which might be due, and having filed a statement in court at the time the period for repurchase expired, to the effort that she was ready to pay whatever sum the court might declare necessary to effect the repurchase, she is entitled to repurchase the real estate in question for the amount of the sale under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> and the payment of the amount agreed upon as rent when the sale was made, that is, P50 per month, from and including the month of June, 1907.\"<\/blockquote>The foregoing facts and findings of law contained in the judgment being thus stated, this court now proceeds to set forth the following facts that appear in the record: <ol> <li>That in the additional instrument executed by Policarpo Gaerlan by reason of the increase of the purchase price by Pl,000, the said Gaerlan bound himself to pay 10 \"over and above the rent of P50 per month which, as he says, we have been paying so far in accordance with the terms of the said instrument.\"\u00a0 (Case No. 5816, folio 16.)<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That in the testamentary proceedings of the late Policarpo Gaerlan (case No. 2655) there appears at folio 28 the following petition from the attorney of the executrix, dated August 21, 1907: \"The plaintiff therefore prays the court to determine the sum or sums which in justice and equity should be paid to T. M. Beech for the redemption of the respective properties.\"<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That in the previous ejectment proceedings (case No. 5816), a copy of the action taken in the other case was offered as evidence, which is in substance as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The holder of the said credit under <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pacto de retro<\/span>, Teodoro Beech, is hereby ordered to refrain from making the note of consolidation of the said property in the registry until the title of this estate thereto has been determined.\u2014Let one copy of this order be at once delivered to the said Teodoro Beech for his information.\u2014Manila, P. I, July 26, 1907.\u2014A. S. Crossfield.\"<\/blockquote><\/li><\/ol>At foot thereof there appears the following note;<br\/><blockquote>\"I have delivered a copy to Don Teodoro Beech at 11 a. m. on this date.\u2014Manila, July 29, 1907. Jose Sanchez.\u2014D. S. M.\" (folio 38.)<br\/><\/blockquote><ol start=\"4\"> <li>That the note consolidating the ownership was entered bj the registrar on the 26th day of July, 1907, as certified at folio 15.<\/li><\/ol>But, in deciding the question of the remedy in the case now before us, the following must be considered:<br\/><br\/>That on appeal to the Court of First Instance from a judgment of the justice of the peace the nature of the question raised by the complaint and the answer thereto in the original suit can not be altered without changing the nature of the object of the appeal.<br\/><br\/>That the complaint filed with the justice of the peace on the 5th of September, 1907, against Juana Jimenez and Francisco Limcuando, by default against the latter, was for ejectment by reason of the lack of payment of the rents stipulated in a contract of lease; this complaint is authorized by article 1569 of the Civil Code which reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"The lessor may judicially dispossess the lessee for any of the following causes:<br\/><br\/>\"1. *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"2. Default in payment of the price agreed upon.\"<\/blockquote>That the contract of lease whereby the defendants were in possession of the two properties sold under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> was absolutely independent of the said <i>pacto<\/i>, inasmuch as there may exist a right to redeem without one of lease, and <i>vice versa<\/i>, a lease without right of redemption.<br\/><br\/>That the complaint for ejectment on account of lack of payment of rent was not excepted to; on the contrary, the defendant present admitted that she owed rent for one month and twenty-five days, at the rate of P60 per month, and for this reason the judgment of the justice of the peace was for the payment, by the defendants to the plaintiff, of the sum of P120, as rent for the said properties for the months of June and July, 1907, and for such as might be owing from the 1st of August, 1907, until such time as they should vacate them, at the rate of P60 per month.<br\/><br\/>That if one of the, defendants was entitled to repurchase the properties by reason of the <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, it was no reason why he should refrain from paying the rentals agreed upon in the contract of lease, because the said <i>pacto<\/i> and contract are entirely separate and distinct; for this reason the court of appeal rightly stated that \"the allegation of the defendant Juana Jimenez, to the effect that, she being a tenant as well as the vendor of the properties sold under <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, the plaintiff could not evict her during the period in which she was entitled to repurchase it, is immaterial.\"<br\/><br\/>That the justice of the peace must have also thus considered the following answer given by the defendant in the eviction proceedings: \"And that there is a case bearing on the same subject in the Court of First Instance of Manila, No. 2655, in which an order was issued prohibiting the plaintiff from making the note of consolidation in the registry of property,\" when for the purpose of its decision the court has not in any manner taken such an allegation into consideration as a defense.<br\/><br\/>That if the complaint for eviction had been based upon the expiration of the term of the contract of lease for the reason that the period for the <i>pacto de retro<\/i> had expired, and if the complaint had been answered by the defense that, in view of the fact that the defendants were still entitled to redeem the properties held on lease, the term of said contract could not be considered as having expired, then such an allegation would have been worthy of consideration by the justice of the peace, and subsequently on appeal by the Court of First Instance, and the finding of either court, whatever it may have been, right or wrong, just or unjust, within the terms of the question set up and sustained, would not be out of place and of the jurisdiction of the court; but this not being the case, it is improper and an evident extralimitation of jurisdiction in the matter on trial, to deal with the right of redemption in an action for eviction for lack of payment of rent, that is, for the violation of the contract of lease.<br\/><br\/>That if the defendant Juana Jimenez still wished to avail herself of the right of redemption after the term of the contract had expired on the 25th of July, 1907, she could not attempt or enforce such a right by consulting a court as to the price that should be paid, nor by praying for a writ of injunction or prohibition against the other contracting party, but solely and simply by bringing such action as she might consider herself to be entitled to, and by such legal remedies depending upon such action as may be proper on the strength of the contract itself; that neither delay nor ignorance, nor the interest of minors, may be considered as a privilege or exception to the rule established by the civil law for the enforcement of contracts. That when a purchaser believes he is entitled to consider that the right of redemption on the part of the vendor has expired, and requests a note of consolidation in the registry of property, his action is authorized by the civil law, and also by the Land Registration Act, as a perfect method of extinguishing an obligation, and such a legal act may only be annulled or canceled by virtue of a final and executory judgment rendered in an action <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ad hoc<\/span> between the parties interested in the said right and its extinction, but not by means of an incidental order upon an <i>ex-parte <\/i>petition without notice to or hearing by the other party.<br\/><br\/>In consequence of the foregoing, it is clearly evident that in this case, one for eviction for nonpayment of rent, which matter alone falls under the jurisdiction of either court, the questions of the right of redemption and judicial extension of the formal term agreed upon in a contract, or that which legally exists by virtue of the express law which controls the parties thereto, to wit, the contract itself, stand out as extralimitations greatly beyond the object of the action and of the judgment appealed from; still more so does the order with respect to the cancellation or nullification of a note of consolidation entered in the registry of property, which has not been the subject of a proper action or trial. Besides, no petition or formal demand was made, praying for an extension of the contractual term which determines the rights and obligations of the parties, and there is no law that authorizes a court, in a case like this, to extend such a term, and to extend it <i>de motu proprio.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Therefore, the said orders are illegal and entirely null and void, and against the said illegality and nullity there can be no appeal or other adequate and expeditious remedy except that now exercised under section 217 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In accordance with section 220, we decide that the court below did not act with due regularity in the exercise of its authority.<br\/><br\/>We definitely affirm the first order contained in the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila in so far as it holds that the plaintiff is entitled to recover possession of the two properties described in the judgment, and so far as it orders that the defendants be ejected therefrom with costs; all the other orders in the said judgment are hereby annulled, without any special ruling as to costs in this appeal. Furthermore, defendant is hereby sentenced to pay the monthly rental of 60, from June, 1907, until the possession of the properties is surrendered.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Exhibit A is the document which substantiates the sale made by Albano1 to the plaintiff, and it has been recognized as the genuine instrument by the witnesses who subscribed it and who were present at its execution. Albano was unable to recognize it because he died before the hearing took place.<br\/><br\/>In his decision the judge says that\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"(1) The ownership of the land described in the complaint had been adjudicated to Felicisima Albano (the defendant) in an action brought against Andres Albano; (2) that even though the plaintiff, Ignacio Acasio had purchased, the said land from Andres, there is now no reason to vacate the former adjudication or judicial declaration, because the right of the purchaser, who may have lost the purchased thing, against the vendor is fixed by the law; and (3) that the plaintiff may bring such action as he may be entitled to against Andres Albano, but he can not bring an action for recovery against the defendant, who considered that she was the owner, a title that she obtained after the corresponding trial.\"<\/blockquote>Basing his opinion on the foregoing statement, the judge found for the defendant and dismissed the complaint with costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>As a matter of fact the only proof offered by the defendant of her pretended title to the land in question was a certified copy of the judgment rendered on the 24th of February, 1905, in the suit brought by her against Andres Albano, whereby she was declared to be the owner of the land that was the subject of said action, the court ordering that the land be delivered to her. This judgment was entered by default against the defendant, Andres Albano, who did not appear at the trial.<br\/><br\/>This latter action was only between Felicisima Albano and Andres Albano; the present plaintiff, Ignacio Acasio, was not a party thereto. For this reason the judgment entered therein does not prejudice the latter, nor can it prejudice him because it is only conclusive between the parties litigating and their principals, and not as to a third party who is entirely foreign to the suit, following the provisions of section 306, paragraph 2, of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is axiomatic in law that no person shall be deprived of the ownership or possession of a thing without being previously heard and defeated in an action. In view of the fact that it has been proven that the land in question was acquired by the plaintiff by purchase in 1804, he can not be deprived of the same, as would be the case were the theory maintained by the trial judge to prevail, by virtue of a decision rendered exclusively against the person who sold it to said plaintiff in an action instituted in 1905; that is, eleven years after the purchase was made. The said judgment can not constitute a conclusive and final defense in favor of the defendant herein; therefore, an error of law was committed by the court below when finding to the contrary in the judgment which is the subject of this appeal.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is \"hereby reversed, and the defendant is hereby ordered to make restitution of the land in question to the plaintiff, without any special ruling as to costs in both instances.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The materiality of this fact, whatever may have been the cause that determined it, can\u00a0 in no manner be discussed in this case.\u00a0 The utmost that could be considered would be the legal imputability thereof.\u00a0 And this aspect of the question arises from the fact that we have considered as substantiated the fact that the defendant offered to pay said\u00a0 rents to the plaintiff, and that the latter declined to accept them because the defendant would not agree to the new\u00a0 contract increasing the rent, from and including the year\u00a0 1903, to 12 pesos and 50 centimos per annum.\u00a0 The amount offered by the defendant for the year 1903 Avas the same as for 1902, namely, 2 pesos and 50 centimos, as he never consented to the increase of the rent suggested in the new contract.<br\/><br\/>The question of imputability in favor of the defendant is decided by the judgment appealed\u00a0 from: (<i>a<\/i>) With reference to the 12 pesos and 50 entimos\u00a0 per annum demanded by the plaintiff for the year 1903, for the reason that,\u00a0 so the judgment reads, there was\u00a0 no agreement as to the increase of the rent, and the lease contract being consensual in nature does not become perfected nor is it enforceable until consented to by the contracting parties as to the thing and the price thereof; (<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 with regard to the 2 pesos and 50 centimos due for 1902, for the reason also, according to said judgment, that the defendant was willing; to pay the original rent, and if the payment was not made it was due to the disagreement between the parties as to the conditions in the new lease contract for the same land.<br\/><br\/>The consequence\u00a0 of such\u00a0 premises is the declaration contained in the judgment, that on the part of the lessee there was no failure to comply with his main obligation under the contract, and that, therefore, the action brought on the ground\u00a0 of\u00a0 failure to\u00a0 pay the rental agreed to is contrary to law.<br\/><br\/>It is thus clearly seen that the judge below considered the original lease contract as subsisting.\u00a0 In no\u00a0 other way could the court arrive at the conclusion that no legal reason exists to <i>effect the termination\u00a0 of said contract;<\/i> and,\u00a0 moreover, there appears the\u00a0 reservation made in the judgment in favor of the plaintiff's right to terminate the contract, upon giving the prior notice required by the law. Such reservation would of course have no reason to exist if the judge had\u00a0 considered\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 contract had terminated.\u00a0 And he does not so consider it because, according to the judge himself, the record contains no positive evidence that,\u00a0 prior\u00a0 to the filing\u00a0 of the\u00a0 complaint, one year's previous notice\u00a0 had been given to the defendant, such\u00a0 as would be\u00a0 necessary in order to terminate a lease of rural\u00a0 property\u00a0 for an indefinite\u00a0 period.<br\/><br\/>According to our opinion, the merits\u00a0 of the case appear in all respects to the contrary.\u00a0 It has been proven by the testimony of several witnesses, including the defendant himself, that lie was\u00a0 several times requested to sign a new contract whereby the rental of 2 pesos and 50 centimos was increased to 12 pesos and 50 centimos per annum, beginning with the year 1903.\u00a0 To such an extent\u00a0 is this true that, according to the defendant himself, it was the very reason why the rentals for\u00a0 1902 and 1903 were not paid,\u00a0 inasmuch as\u00a0 he did not conform\u00a0 to the increase\u00a0 of the rent suggested by the plaintiff.\u00a0 Such\u00a0 request\u00a0 was equivalent to, and as a matter of fact it was, an actual case of ejectment.\u00a0 The supreme court of Spain has so held\u00a0 in its\u00a0 decision of November 8, 1867, which\u00a0 establishes the following doctrine:<br\/><blockquote>\"In view of the fact that the law does not prescribe the form\u00a0 or special and exact manner in which an ejectment is to\u00a0 be carried out, the way in which the parties shall mutually agree, and with the due prior notice,\u00a0 their intention to terminate the lease contract\u00a0 when the same\u00a0 is made\u00a0 for an indefinite period is left to\u00a0 their free will. The request for a\u00a0 new lease contract made by the\u00a0 owner to the person occupying his property is a\u00a0 real statement of his intent to put an end to the previous lease executed for an indefinite period, and has the legal character of an ejectment, inasmuch as, if the tenant does not accept the new contract, he would be unavoidably bound\u00a0 to vacate the property\u00a0 within the legal period.\"<\/blockquote>In the present case the precise date on which\u00a0 the first request was made to the defendant for the\u00a0 execution of the new contract does not appear, but it was, however, made in the year 1902.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 thus\u00a0 positively asserted\u00a0 by one of the witnesses, and is further implied from the fact that, when the defendant tried at the time to pay the rent for 1902, as he states, his disagreement with the. plaintiff, in respect to the conditions that\u00a0 he considered burdensome in the said new contract, had already arisen.\u00a0 This being the case, it results that the plaintiff's notification to the defendant which, as already stated, amounts to a real ejectment, was made one year in advance of the date of the complaint, and\u00a0 that therefore it was made with the prior notice required by law, even if in this\u00a0 case were applied, as the court below does in the judgment appealed from, the legislation in force prior to the present Civil Code, which ruled at the time when the original lease was entered into, inasmuch as under the same one year's prior notice was to be mutually given by the lessor and the lessee for terminating contracts for the lease of rural property when made without a fixed period.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the record, which is very deficient, that the property in question was more urban than rural in character because it is described in the complaint as land destined for the building of houses.\u00a0 This description has not been\u00a0 contradicted by the defendant, and apparently it was accepted by the court below, for in the judgment appealed from the denomination of <i>solar<\/i> (a building lot) is repeatedly given to the said parcel, of land and, according to the official Spanish\u00a0 dictionary, it\u00a0 means\u00a0 the soil whereon a house or dwelling is erected, or whereon the same was erected.\u00a0 This consideration is corroborated by the statement of the defendant, asserting that on the said land exists a house which cost him 3,500 pesos to build, while the trees and other things planted thereon had only cost 80\u00a0 pesos; such a fact shows, in our opinion, that this question refers in reality to land intended chiefly for the erection of houses, and is not devoted to agricultural purposes, which is the circumstance that\u00a0 characterizes property of\u00a0 the latter description.\u00a0\u00a0 This being the case, the term for ejectment, according\u00a0 to the law applied\u00a0 by the court below,\u00a0 would only be forty days.<br\/><br\/>In any case the inevitable conclusion is that in 1903 the original contract, fixing the rent at 2 pesos and 50 centimos per annum, was terminated by virtue of the repeated intimations made to\u00a0 the defendant regarding the new contract increasing the\u00a0 rent to 12 pesos and 50 centimos per annum.\u00a0 Hence, the defendant had no right to demand that the original contract\u00a0 should prevail, offering to pay the rental of 2 pesos and 50 centimos therein stipulated,\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 year 1903.\u00a0 Since, he continued to occupy the land notwithstanding the fact that\u00a0 he did not agree to the conditions of the new contract submitted by the plaintiff, he was under the obligation to pay a just and reasonable rent for the occupation and enjoyment of the land beginning with said year.\u00a0 He was then well aware that the plaintiff claimed a rental of 12 pesos and\u00a0 50 centimos per annum, which is the same as now demanded in the complaint.\u00a0 If in the opinion of the defendant the rent was excessive, he should have so alleged as a defense in his answer to the complaint, in order that evidence in connection\u00a0 therewith might have\u00a0 been adduced at the trial.\u00a0 He made no allegation whatever in this sense and based his exception on entirely different grounds, thereby excluding from all controversy the claim of the defendant. For this reason, and in the absence of proof to the contrary, we consider that the rental of 12 pesos and 50 centimos per annum,\u00a0 demanded by the plaintiff for\u00a0 the succeeding years beginning with 1903, inclusive, is just and reasonable, in conformity with the settled rule of the court in the cases of Iturralde <i>vs.<\/i> Alfonso\", No. 3402 (7 Phil. Rep., 576), and Iturralde <i>vs.<\/i> Evangelista, No. 3406\u00a0 (7 Phil. Rep., 588).<br\/><br\/>And in view of the fact that the defendant has not paid nor even offered to pay the aforesaid rent for the year 1903, we hereby hold that the demand of the complaint for an ejectment is in accordance with the law, even if the rent for the\u00a0 year 1902 were ignored, and it is not necessary, for the purposes of this decision, to dwell on the sufficiency of the offer of payment\u00a0 made by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the judgment appealed from is hereby reversed, the defendant being sentenced to place the plaintiff in possession of the land in question, and to pay him the sum of 2 pesos and 50 centimos as rent due for the year 1902, and the\u00a0 sum of 12 pesos and 50 centimos for each of the succeeding years beginning with 1903, until the execution of such sentence as may be entered by virtue of this decision; and in view of the fact that in the complaint the payment of the rentals corresponding to the years 1902 and 1903\u00a0 alone is asked, the amendment of the same is hereby ordered pursuant to the provisions of section 126 of the Code of Procedure\u00a0 in Civil Actions, to the effect that the\u00a0 request therein shall include the rental for the years following 1903, until the sentence is executed.\u00a0 With the costs of the first instance against the defendant, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

On the 1st day of August, 1905, in the municipality of Legaspi, the defendant company issued three bills of exchange to the order of the Chinaman Uy-Oyan, drawn upon Messrs. Urrutia &amp; Co. of Manila, which were of the following tenor:<br\/><br\/>\" 'E. Diaz y Ca. No. ,1782. P1,000. Legaspi, August 1, 1905.

(Sgd.) E. Diaz y Ca. (Rubricated) Sres. G. Urrutia y Ca. Manila. Advised per steamer <i>Cantabria,<\/i> according to agreement.'<br\/><br\/>\" 'E. Diaz y Ca. No. 1784. 500. Legaspi, August 1, 1905. Eight days after sight of this sole bill of exchange, please pay to the order of the Chinaman Uy-Oyan, the sum of five hundred pesos, Conant, value on account of hemp, which you will charge as advised. (Sgd.) E. Diaz y Ca. (Rubricated) Sres. G. Urrutia y Ca. Manila. Advised per steamer <i>Cantabria<\/i>, according to agreement.'<br\/><br\/>\"2. The bills of exchange above referred to were taken up by the Chinaman Salvador Palanca from the defendant company, and delivered by him to the said Chinaman Uy-Oyan by means of a written agreement, by virtue of which the party last named engaged to pay in hemp the amount thereof, on or before the 9th day of the aforesaid month of August, and should said day arrive without such payment having been made, the said bills would not be paid; for this reason, on each of such bills, and after the words 'advised per steamer <i>Cantabria<\/i>,' the following was added: 'According to agreement.'<br\/><br\/>\"3. On the 1st of August, 1905, cited above, the aforenamed Uy-Oyan, after subscribing his signature, Uy-Oyan, and his rubric, on the back of each of the above-mentioned bills of exchange, delivered them to' the Chinaman Mariano Almonte, who made use of them on the same date by Handing them to the agent of the plaintiff company in the municipality of Legaspi, in order to pay with their value what he owed the latter; by reason of such payment, how\u00adever, no special indorsement was made on each of the said bills in favor of the plaintiff, beyond the signature and rubric of Chinaman Uy-Oyan, as already stated.<br\/><br\/>\"4. The plaintiff company, after having acquired in the manner just described the said three bills of exchange, without having any knowledge of the agreement above alluded to, forwarded the same on the 12th of August to the city of Manila for collection, and from said date credited the account of Chinaman Almonte with the value thereof, but on the 20th of said month canceled the entry so1 made in its books by means of a counter entry, and thus the Chinaman Almonte came again to owe the plaintiff company the same amount of P2,000, which the said bills of exchange amounted to, as long as they were not accepted or paid for any reason, as was stated in the said books. *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"5. The said bills of exchange were neither accepted nor paid to the plaintiff company who held and presented them for acceptance and payment, because the said Chinaman Uy-Oyan, who had taken them up, had not fulfilled the agreement mentioned above, under which the defendant company issued in his favor the aforesaid bills of exchange.\"<\/blockquote>It has also been declared by the judgment that the said bills of exchange were duly protested, both for want of acceptance and of payment, and that the defendant company had been duly informed thereof.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff company claims on its own behalf the amount of the said bills of exchange, alleging that the ownership of the same had been transferred to the company prior to maturity. The trial judge found in his decision that, for the reason that no date was affixed in the blank indorsement signed by the Chinaman Uy-Oyan, the person who took up the drafts, the plaintiff company had not acquired the ownership thereof, and that the assignment made in its favor should be considered simply as a commission for collection; in consequence thereof he also declared that the company was not entitled to claim the amount of the said drafts, and decided the case in favor of the defendant, dismissing the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The question at issue is, in the first place, whether a blank indorsement, not dated, transfers the ownership of the draft thus indorsed. The Code of Commerce is very clear and positive on this point. After setting forth that the ownership of drafts may be transferred by indorsement (art. 461), and that it must contain the requisites enumerated in article 462, among which is the date on which it is made, it provides by article 463 the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"If the statement of the date is omitted in the indorsement, the ownership of the draft shall not be transferred, and it shall be understood as simply a commission for collection.\"<\/blockquote>According to this the indorsement in question did not transfer the ownership of the draft to the plaintiff company, because the date on which the same was made was not stated.<br\/><br\/>It is argued by the appellant that the provision last cited refers only to article 462, to which, as alleged, it is an exception, and in no way refers to article 405, which deals with indorsements signed in blank. In the opinion of the appellant, these indorsements signed in blank constitute a special class of indorsement to which the provisions of article 463, already quoted, do not apply. Should this be true, article 465 would be an exception to article 463, in the same manner as, according to the appellant, the latter article is an exception to article 462. It is, however, neither the one nor the other. Far from being an exception, article 463 is, on the contrary, the real complement of article 462, inasmuch as it establishes the legal effects of the omission of the date as required by the latter, and the provisions thereof, general and absolute as they are, embrace all classes of indorsements, and there exists no reason, and much less a legal provision, excepting therefrom the indorsements to which article 465 refers.<br\/><br\/>The literal wording of the latter is as follows :<br\/><blockquote>\"Indorsements signed in blank and those in which the value is not stated shall transfer the ownership of the draft and shall produce the same effect as if 'value received' were written therein.\"<\/blockquote>In our opinion this article has no other effect than to require that, indorsements signed in blank be held to mean that the value has been received in cases where it is not specially expressed therein. If, as the appellant says, the provisions of article 463 were not applicable to the indorsements mentioned in article 465, it would then result that not only the indorsement signed in blank but also those wherein the value is not stated (because said article deals with both the one and the other) would transfer the ownership of the drafts without the necessity of stating therein the date on which the indorsements were made. Thus, in order to avoid the necessity of complying with the latter requisite, it would suffice to omit to state the value, which would lead to the following peculiar result, namely, that an indorsement, wherein the value is not stated, transfers the ownership of the draft, even though no mention be made of the date; while another indorsement, in which the value is stated, will further necessitate the date being expressed in order that it may produce the effect of transferring the ownership of the draft. From this would be derived the inevitable conclusion that the fewer of the requisites prescribed by article 462 the indorsement contained the more effective it would be, which would be a real absurdity from any point of view.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth, we maintain herein the doctrine set up in the matter of the International Banking Corporation <i>vs.<\/i> Montague (6 Phil. Rep., 667), that if the date is omitted in the indorsement the ownership of the draft shall not be transferred, and it shall be understood as simply a commission for collection.<br\/><br\/>The appellant insists that the company acquired the ownership of the drafts, if not by means of the special contract of indorsement, at least by virtue of the assignment made thereto by Almonte. The appellant company says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The judgment itself declares that Almonte delivered them to the plaintiff in payment of a debt, so that it is unquestionable that such delivery was made with the intent, on the part of both, to transfer to the plaintiff the ownership of the credit which the drafts represented.\"<\/blockquote>And the said transfer, or assignment, according to the appellant, needs no written form to insure its full validity and efficiency under section 335 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This aspect of the question need not be considered here. It is not claimed that Uy-Oyan, to whose order the drafts were issued, made an assignment of them to the plaintiff. Between the latter and Uy-Oyan there has existed no juridical relation of any kind. The pretended assignment of the drafts in favor of the plaintiff was made by Almonte in payment of a sum which he owed. In order that by such an act Almonte might have transferred to the plaintiff the ownership of the drafts, even granting that it produced all of the legal effects that the appellant attributes to it, it was still necessary that Almonte should have previously acquired the ownership of the aforementioned drafts, it being a settled rule that no one can transfer to another a right which he does not possess. Now, therefore, Almonte could not have acquired such ownership except by means of the indorsement signed in blank by Uy-Oyan, inasmuch as no other title or method of acquisition is alleged. And, it being shown to be insufficient to transfer the ownership of the drafts in favor of the indorsee, it must necessarily be concluded that the latter\u2014that is,\u2014Almonte could not in his turn have transferred the ownership to' the plaintiff, whatever may have been the contract entered into between them.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Fulgencio; it has been agreed to between us that we shall convey to him the said land from this day, and that he will cause the same to be worked from this date as if it were his own property for a period of seven years; that we shall have the right to redeem it for the said sum of 1,000 pesos at the expiration of seven years in such a manner that said land shall be under his care as long as we do not pay the redemption money. This is what we have agreed to, which we ratify and bind ourselves personally and with our property, present and future, waiving all such rights as may be contrary to this document. In witness whereof we attach our signatures in the presence of the witnesses who are cognizant of this fact, on this, the 18th day of July, 1883. (Signed) Tomas Cantos. (Signed) Fausto Echavaria. (Signed) Julian Pastor.\"<\/blockquote>The said document in the Tagalog dialect is an authentic one for the reason that it was so admitted by the plaintiffs when the same was exhibited by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The selling spouses state in the document above alluded to that they saw fit to sell a parcel of land which they owned in the barrio of Pinamukan, within the territory of the capital, with the right of repurchase, to the said Fulgencio Babasa, who in fact bought it for the sum of 1,000 pesos, silver coin, which they received from him, and that out of said sum, 300 pesos came from Jose Babasa, the son of the purchaser.<br\/><br\/>The stipulated contract, owing to its form and the terms in which the document has been prepared, is in no way a contract of loan with mortgage, but a real contract of sale with right to repurchase treated of in article 1507 et seq. of the Civil Code. It is valid, perfect, and efficient, because the three requisites prescribed by article 1261 of the Civil Code are present therein, and is binding notwithstanding the fact that it has been drawn up as a private document, in accordance with the provisions of article 1278 of said code, inasmuch as the legalization of a contract by means of a public writing and its entry in the register are not essential solemnities or requisites for its validity and efficacy as between the contracting parties, but conditions of form which the law imposes in order that it may be effective as against third persons, and that a publicly executed and recorded agreement may be respected by the latter.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, it was agreed by the contracting parties, that from the date of the contract, July 18, 1883, the sellers of the land would deliver it to the purchaser in order that he might work the same as if it were his own property for seven years beginning from said date.<br\/><br\/>It was likewise stipulated that at the expiration of the said seven years the sellers would be entitled to redeem it for the said sum of 1,000 pesos, but that so long as it was not repurchased by return of the sale price, the property would continue to be at the disposal of the purchaser.<br\/><br\/>So that the redemption or repurchase could not be effected until after the lapse of the seven years agreed to, although no period was fixed within which the repurchase, which the plaintiffs might have demanded since the 19th of July, 1890, was to take place.<br\/><br\/>The question set up by the appellants is: Within what period may the sellers repurchase from the buyer the thing sold? It is admitted that Law 42, title 5, <i>Partida<\/i> 5, which is cited, does not fix the period within which the thing sold should be redeemed, but it is affirmed that the right of conventional redemption gives place to a personal action,the prescription of which is fixed by Law 63 of Toro, now Law, 5, title 8, book 11 of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion<\/i>, at twenty years; therefore, the demand for redemption has been interposed within the said twenty years which have not yet expired.<br\/><br\/>In order to show that the court below has not erred in rendering its decision, especially on this point, attention is called to the fact, already mentioned, that the plaintiffs had the right to redeem said land from the 19th of July, 1890, the day after the seven years named in the contract had expired, on which date the Civil Code, which became effective on the 8th of December, 1889, was in force; therefore, in view of the provisions of article 1939 thereof the rules prescribed by it are perfectly applicable to this case, and it should be noticed that since July, 1890, to May, 1907, at which latter date the complaint was interposed, the four years fixed by article 1508 for the exercise of the right of repurchase, in the absence of an express covenant, have more than expired, notwithstanding the fact that the contract is subject to the provisions of the laws in force prior to the enforcement of the said Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>However, if notwithstanding what has been agreed to by the parties, which in the matter of contracts is the law, according to the constant jurisprudence of courts, it were certain that the right to repurchase commenced from the very date of the contract or on the succeeding day, said article 1939 is also applicable to this case, and for the better understanding of the same it is copied herein:<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 1939. Prescription, which began to run before the publication of this code, shall be governed by the prior laws; but if, after this code became operative, all the time required in the same for prescription has elapsed, it shall be effectual, even if according to said prior laws a longer period of time may be required.\"<\/blockquote>So that in either case and even though it were considered that the right of repurchase would only prescribe by the lapse of twenty years, which time for prescription began either in July, 1883, or in the same month of 1890, such long period of time had not yet expired when the said code went into effect in December, 1889; therefore, in accordance with article 1939 inserted above, the provisions of article 1508 should be strictly observed when deciding this litigation, which article provides that in the absence of an express agreement the right to recover the thing sold shall only last and may only be exercised within four years counted from the date of the contract; this term, counted from December, 1889, when the said, code went into effect, to the date in 1907 on which the complaint was filed, has expired. The said four years constitute a special period for prescription of the right to repurchase.<br\/><br\/>As to the allegation that the plaintiff, Juana Cantos, was a minor at the time when the said four years had expired, for the purpose of this decision it suffices to state the special provision of the Civil Code in connection with the effects which prescription produces on persons of all classes, including privileged and juridical persons, as may be seen from article 1932, which reads :<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 1932. Rights and actions shall extinguish by prescription to the prejudice of all kinds of persons, including juridical persons, in the terms prescribed by law.<br\/><br\/>\"Persons incapacitated to administer their property shall always retain the right to sue their legal representatives whose negligence may have been the cause of the prescription.\"<\/blockquote>The principle which this article establishes is applicable without distinction to all such as were the owners of property subject to prescription, according to article 1936 of said code, which repeals all previously recognized exceptions and brings everybody, for high considerations of public interest, under the general rules of the law although for reasons of equity there is reserved to incapacitated persons the right to sue their representatives or guardians for damages suffered through the fault or negligence of the latter.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, it is known that since the time when the Civil Code went into effect no sale with right of repurchase can be made for an indefinite period inasmuch as article 1508 of the same fixes the period at four years if no term has been agreed to, and in case of agreement said term can not exceed ten years, and said article is applicable even to contracts entered into prior to the Civil Code, by virtue of the provisions of article 1939, cited above, for the reason that property should not be subject indefinitely or for a long time to resolutory conditions such as redemption, and prescription during its running does not create a vested right but only a hope of the realization or the effecting of the same; therefore, in answer to the exigencies of the public good and the interests of society, the provisions of the said article were enacted by the legislator, employing therein a restricting and limiting system as security for the ever to be respected right of ownership. This case is similar to that of Garcia et al. <i>vs.<\/i> Diamson (8 Phil. Rep., 414).<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth, and accepting the considerations contained in the judgment appealed from, it is our opinion that the same should be affirmed, and that the complaint interposed by the appellants against the defendant, Jose Babasa, be dismissed with the costs of this instance against the said appellants.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The\u00a0 next question to be considered is, When should that exception be brought to this court for review?<br\/><br\/>Section 123 of the code provides\u00a0 as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"*\u00a0 *\u00a0 * nor shall any ruling, order, or judgment be the subject of\u00a0 appeal to the Supreme Court\u00a0 until final judgment is rendered for one party or the other.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>Final judgment upon the merits of this case had already been entered when this exception was taken.\u00a0\u00a0 After the final judgment there still remains its execution.\u00a0 In the proceedings therefor there are various steps.\u00a0 In an action to foreclose a mortgage the last step is the order confirming the sale.\u00a0\u00a0 Section 257 says:<br\/><blockquote>\"*\u00a0 *\u00a0 * The sale when confirmed by decree of the court,\u00a0 shall operate to divest the rights of all the parties to the action and to vest their rights\u00a0 in the purchaser. Should the court decline to confirm the sale, for good cause shown, and should set it aside, it shall order a resale in accordance with law.\"<\/blockquote>Until a sale has been finally confirmed, we do not think that the proceedings for the execution of1 the judgment can be said to have terminated, and, applying by analogy the rule of section 123, we hold that exceptions taken by the plaintiff or the defendant in the original action, after the judgment and before the\u00a0 decree of confirmation, can not be brought here for review\u00a0 until such decree has been entered.\u00a0 Whether the same rule would apply to an exception taken by the purchaser at the sale in case it were set aside against his protest, we need not now determine.<br\/><br\/>Nor do we determine what would be the rule in a case other than one for the foreclosure of a mortgage. It follows from what has been said that the court below is not now required to sign the bill of exceptions presented, but after a resale\u00a0 has been had and\u00a0 that\u00a0 has been confirmed, the defendant will then be entitled to present and have allowed his bill, containing all the exceptions taken by him\u00a0 after the final judgment.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant is not entitled to the relief asked in this proceeding.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

y el Calixto al tratar de acudir a su vez a Venancio y Rosendo, recihiendo ambos, (Venancio y Calixto) mas de veinte golpes cada uno dados por el acusado con toda fuerza con aquel baston, grueso como la mu\u00f1eca de la mano.\u00a0 Otra testigo hay ademas, llamada Timotea Raga, que asevera haber visto aquellos malostratos desde una casa vecina a la del municipio.<br\/><br\/>La primera querella en esta causa fue presentada con fecha 26 de Septiembre de 1906, o sea cinco meses despues de ocurrido ek suceso de autos.\u00a0 Hasta entonces no se dio cuenta del hecho a ninguna autotidad.\u00a0 El testigo Venancio Hayoma trato de explicar esta larga demora diciendo que no se habia denunciado el hecho porque <u>los policias que lo han visto son testigos de Felipe<\/u> (el acusado).\u00a0 Y sin embargo el mismo dice en su declaracion que ningun policia presencio el suceso porque el procesado habia tomado la pre-caucion de hacer bajar a todos los policias y otras personas que habia en la casa municipal antes de maltratarles.\u00a0 Otro hecho que no se explica en la causa es el siguiente: aquella primera querella fue enmendada con fecha 12 de Febrero de 1907, ocurrida ya la muerte de Rosenda Hayoma que fallecio en Diciembre anterior.\u00a0 Si como afirman los testigos de la acusacion, Rosendo murio de resultas de los malostratos inferidos al mismo por el procesado, parecia logico que al enmendarse la querella se hubiese acusado a este del delito de homicido en lugar del de lesiones graves solament.<br\/><br\/>Resulta tambien que el Juzgado condeno al procesado, no por el delito de lesiones graves acusado en la querella, sino por el de lesiones menos graves, apreciando que estas le produjeron al ofendido inutilidad para el trabajo por mas de ocho dias y no mas de treinta, a pesar de la categorica afirmacion de los testigos de cargo de que aquella inutilidad duro cinco meses, o sea hasta el mes de Diciembre en que fallecio dicho ofendido.<br\/><br\/>A juzgar por los anteriores detalles parece que ni el Juzgado ni el Fiscal mismo que dirigio la acusacion han dado entero credito a todo lo declarado por los testigos de cargo.<br\/><br\/>Tantas y tales son en efecto las contradicciones en que esos testigos han incurrido, que tiene que resultar necesariamente muy sospechoso su testimonio.<br\/><br\/>Y su contradiccion empieza desde el principio mismo de sus declaraciones al referir el motivo de los malostratos que se imputan al acusado.\u00a0 Venancio Hayoma dice que lo fue el no querer el ofendido Rosendo continuar trabajando como aparcero del acusado, por no estar conforme con las nuevas condiciones de la aparceria impuestas por este ultimo, y Calixto Ragot dice textualmente por su parte que <u>el motivo del castigo procedia de mi terreno que me lo queria quitar Santiago Tayco<\/u>.\u00a0 Luego relata el Venancia el comienzo del suceso diciendo que alcentrar el y sus dos compa\u00f1eros en el despacho del acusado, mando este bajar a los policias y les pidio a ellos las cedulas.\u00a0 \"Al acabar de leer las cedulas, a\u00f1ade, \"nos dijo Tayco que <u>nos sentaramos<\/u>, y <u>despues de pocos minutos de sentados<\/u>, cogio un baston y nos pego,\"\u00a0 El Ragot declara sobre esto de modo my differnte, pues dice que al llegar ellos a dicho despacho, <u>en seguida, inmediatamente, sin intervalo alguno de momento<\/u> les pego el acusado estando ellos de pie.\u00a0 Ambos testigos dicen que este les pego con el baston unas veintes veces a cada uno u unas cuarenta al ofendido Rosendo, mientras que segun Timotea Raga, la testigo que dice haber presenciado desde una casa vecina los malostratos, no dio el acusado mas que un golpe con el baston a cada unp de los tres.\u00a0 Y cuenta que esta testigo aseguro varias veces en su declaracion haber visto el <u>primer<\/u> palo dado por el acusado, que lo fue, segun ella, sobre la espalda de Rosendo.\u00a0 Habiendo llegado la testigo a tiempo de poder ver el primer palo, no hay motivo para career que hubiese dejado de ver los demas palos que sucedieron a aquel, muy numerosos por cierto segun los dos anteriores testigos, de haberlos habido realmente, toda vez que ella se paro en el sitio donde se encontraba precisamente para ver y observar lo que ocurria dentro del municipio.\u00a0 Se contradicen tambien en cuanto a la clase de baston usado por el acusado que segun afirmacion categorica e insistente de Ragot que asegura haberse fijado bien en ello, era de madera, y no de bejuco; mientras que al decir de Venancio Hayoma y Timotea Raga era de bejuco, a\u00f1adiendo esta ulitma que se veian clara y distintamente los gajos o nudas del bejuco desde la casa donde ella se halla ba, distante unas diez brazas de la casa del municipio.<br\/><br\/>Se pueden citar todavia otras varias contradicciones de importancia de estos testigos, entre ellas las siguientes: Venancio Hayoma declara que al recibir el sexto golpe del acusado se cayo el al suelo perdiendo el conocimiento hasta que fue auxiliado por Ragot, el cual le desmiente rotundamente por cuanto dice que no se cayo aquel ni una sola vez al suelo, ni por tanto, como as consiguiente, perdio el conocimiento durante el suceso de autos.\u00a0 Pro su parte el Ragot asevera que los palos que le dio el acusado le fracturaron una costilla, al paso que segun Venancio Hayoma, ni el, ni Rosendo ni Ragot sufrieron fractura alguna de hueso con motivo de aquellos palos.\u00a0 El mismo Venancio Hayoma dice que el aqui ofendido Rosendo quedo en tan mal estado despues de los malostratos que, para regresar a su casa, tuvo que ir <u>en brazos de Calixto Ragot y sostenido por este<\/u>, mientras que Ragot declara que al salir los tres del municipio se fueron separadamente cada uno a sus respectivas casas, de lo que se deduce que no acompa\u00f1o, ni menos llevo en bravos a su casa a Rosendo.\u00a0 Desprendese esto mismo de la declaracion de Nicolasa Adon, concubina de este, por cuanto dice que Rosendo llego a su casa solo, despues del suceso.\u00a0 Esa misma Nicolasa Adon declara que al subir Rosendo a su casa cayose inmediatemente al suelo y desde entonces no ha vuelto a bajar de casa por falta de fuerza hasta que murio, extremo este ultimo que ha sido igualmente aseverado por Venancio Hayoma, Pues bien, contradiciendo terminantemente a estos dos testigos dice la otra testigo de la acusacion, Timotea Raga, que como a las tres de la tarde del dia del suceso, o sea tres horas despues de ocurrido este, estuvo en su casa el Rosendo para decirle que no podia seguir curando a su hijo porque le dolia el cuerpo.\u00a0 Por lo demas, es evidente que la supuesta debilidad de Rosendo no seria tan grande ni tan extremada que tuvieran que ayudarle aun para levantarse de la cama como lo afirman Venancio Hayoma, Calixto Ragot y Nicolasa Adon, puesto que segun esta misma y Timotea Raga, pudo trasladarse y de hecho se traslado a caballo desde el barrio de Cambalansan donde vivia hasta el barrio de Caballan donde fallecio, siendo este barrio muy distante al decir de la Raga.<br\/><br\/>Hay ademas un detalle de importancia que da la medida de la poca credibilidad de los testigos Venancio Hayoma y Calixto Ragot Estos testigos prestaron declaracion en el juicio a mediados de Febrero de 1907, es decir, diez meses despues de inferidos los malostratos que atribuyen al acusado, y declararon que hasta entonces sentian dolores en el cuerpo producidos por aquellos malostratos, El Ragot dijo ademas que seguia curandose todavia de la fractura de la costilla que no se hallaba aun curada del todo.\u00a0 Pues bien, estos testigos, a requirimiento del Fiscal, fueron reconocidos por el Medico Don Vicente Locsin, Presidente Municipal de sanidad de Dumaguete, en Septiembre de 1906, seis meses antes de la declaracion de los mismos, y ese Medico certifico entonces al Fiscal y declaro despues en el juicio, que no habia encontrado ninguna lesion, ni fractura, ni siquiera vestigios de una ni otra cosa en el cuerpo de dichos testigos.<br\/><br\/>Por otra parte el acusado declaro que el dia 25 de Abril de 1906 no estuvieron Rosendo Hayoma ni Calixto Ragot en la casa municipal, habiendo estado solo Venancio Hayoma a quien habia mandado llamar por poseer una lanza con la que amenezaba a sus convecinos del barrio segun denuncia que habia recibido de estos.\u00a0 Este ultimo hecho, aunque negado por el Venancio, ha resultado suficientemente probado con la comunicacion que obraba en el Gobierno de la provincia (exhibit A de la defansa) dirigida por el acusado, como presidente Municipal de su pueblo, con fecha 26 de Abril de 1906 dando parte de la capture de una lanza en poder de dicho Venancia verificada el dia anterior, o sea en la fecha de autos justamente.\u00a0 Varios testigos confirman lo dalcarado por el acusado respecto a no haber estado Rosendo Hayoma y Calixto Ragot, y si solo el Venancio en la casa municipal en aquella fecha, y declaran ademas que el acusado no maltrato a este ni a ninguna otra persona en aquella ocasion.<br\/><br\/>En cuanto al supuesto ofendido Venancio Hayoma que se dice haber estado constantemente postrado en cama desde que fue maltratado hasta que fallecio, hay varios testigos que afirman haberle visto varias veces en la plaza y en la gallera en los meses de Mayo, Junio, Julio y Agosto de 1906; y el mediquillo que le asistio por el me de Octubre en la enfermedad de que murio, asevera que dicha enfermedad era tisis y que la venia padeciendo el Rosendo de hacia unos dos a\u00f1os.\u00a0 Este testigo declara tambien que nunca le dijo aquel que su enfermedad tuviese por causa algun maltrato inferido por el acusado.<br\/><br\/>En vista de estas pruebas y de las muchas y manifiestas contradicciones de los testigos de la acusacion, no podemos dar por probado fuera de toda duda racional el hecho, ya harto extraordinario en si, de que tres hombres jovenes de 20 y 30 a\u00f1os, como lo son Venancio Hayoma y Calixto Ragot, a solas con el acusado, se hubiesen dejado pegar por este tantas y tantas veces hasta el punto de echar sangre por la boca una de ellos, de perder el conocimiento el otro y de fracturarsele una costilla al tercero, recibiendo palo tras palo con los brazos cruzados (asi lo dicen del ofendido Rosendo) tan resignada y pacientemente que no hayan tratado siquiera de esquivar de algun modo los golpes, o por lo menos de huir de tan grave y brutal agresion, ya que no resistirla por el alegado respeto a\/autoridad que aquel ejercia.<br\/><br\/>En su virtud y con revocacion de la sentencia apelada, absolvemos libremente al acusado con las costas de ambas instancias de officio.\u00a0 Transcurridos diez dias desde la notification de esta decision, dectese sentencia a tenor de lo resuelto, y diez dias despues devuelvase la cause al Juzgado de su procedencia a los efectos a que en derecho hubiere lugar.<br\/><br\/>Asi se ordena.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.J., Gomez, Carson<\/i> y <i>Willard.<\/i><\/div>",

He appealed from the judgment of the justice of the peace to the Court of First Instance,\u00a0 where the plaintiff reproduced his original demand presented in the lower court.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff's contention is that he furnished the defendant P75 with which the defendant was to buy wood that was to be delivered to and sold by the plaintiff,\u00a0 and that the profits of the transaction should be equally divided between the parties.\u00a0 The defendant at\u00a0 the trial admitted that he\u00a0 had received the P75 for the purpose named, and testified that he had invested the money in wood and had delivered it to the plaintiff.\u00a0 The only question of fact arising on the plaintiff's complaint relates to the delivery of the wood to the plaintiff by\u00a0 the defendant.\u00a0 The court below found that there had been such a delivery and the evidence, in our opinion, strongly preponderates in favor of that finding.<br\/><br\/>This disposes of the plaintiff's appeal so far as it relates to the cause of action set out in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The defendant presented an answer and counterclaim which was amended several times and which finally asked for an accounting and for judgment for\u00a0 the amount which upon such accounting would be found due from the plaintiff to the defendant.\u00a0 What\u00a0 that amount would be, does not clearly appear from the counterclaim and it does\u00a0 not appear that such a counterclaim was within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the decision of the Court of\u00a0 First Instance that the plaintiff\u00a0 moved to dismiss the counterclaim.\u00a0 That\u00a0 court granted this motion, reserving,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 to the defendant the right to\u00a0 maintain an action upon the matters presented in his counterclaim.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff and appellant now claims that the court, instead of dismissing the counterclaim,\u00a0 should have acquitted the plaintiff of it and that\u00a0 it should\u00a0 not\u00a0 have reserved to the defendant the right to maintain an action upon the matters therein set out.<br\/><br\/>This reservation, however, produced no effect.\u00a0 Except in special cases where it is otherwise distinctly provided, such a reservation can produce no effect.\u00a0 If, where the counterclaim\u00a0 is dismissed, the law gives the party the right to maintain another action, he has such\u00a0 right whether\u00a0 the first judgment contains a reservation to that effect or not.\u00a0 If, on the contrary, the law gives him no such right,\u00a0 then the court can not give it to him by attempting to reserve it.\u00a0 (Belzunce <i>vs.<\/i> Fernandez, 10 Phil. Rep., 452; Almeida <i>vs.<\/i> Abaroa, 8 Phil. Rep., 178.)<br\/><br\/>Upon the other point presented by this assignment of error, the appellant is in no position to complain of the action of the\u00a0 court.\u00a0 He asked that the counterclaim be dismissed and the court granted his motion.\u00a0 He, therefore, can not now complain of such action.<br\/><br\/>The court below held that in an action appealed from a justice court the defendant was, in\u00a0 the Court of First Instance, limited to the pleading which he had presented before the justice of the peace, and that the Court of First Instance had no authority to allow an amendment by\u00a0 adding new defenses or counterclaims.\u00a0 In view of what\u00a0 has been hereinbefore said, it is not necessary for us to decide this\u00a0 question, but we call attention to the fact that the\u00a0 former decisions of this\u00a0 court upon the subject of the nature of the pleadings which may be presented in the\u00a0 Court of First\u00a0 Instance in cases\u00a0 appealed from a court of a justice of the peace, go no further than to say that the plaintiff can not so amend his complaint as to present a cause of action which would not be within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace.'

Higgins, in 1902.\u00a0 The pretensions of the plaintiff that the defendant recovered the landing tolls and received the rent under the contract with Higgins by her authority and not under claim of ownership, and that she permitted the defendant to keep this money as an act of charity are not supported by satisfactory evidence, and were properly rejected by the trial court.<br\/><br\/>It is not necessary to determine whether the particular tract in question is included in the land which the documentary evidence introduced by the plaintiff tends to prove were purchased by her husband, because we think that this documentary evidence clearly established the fact found by the trial judge, that this land was purchased by plaintiff's husband; the oral testimony of the witnesses quoted in appellant's brief to the effect that it was bought by both husband and wife is not sufficient to maintain a finding to that effect.<br\/><br\/>We might add that granting that whatever land was purchased, was purchased for husband and wife jointly, there would still he grave doubt whether the evidence of record in this case is sufficient to establish a better right to possession in the vendor, than the right of the original defendant in this action.\u00a0 It is not necessary, however, for us to make a finding upon this point because we are of opinion that the evidence of record fails to establish plaintiff's allegation as to her joint ownership of the land with her husband.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the trial court is affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 After twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith and ten days thereafter let the record be returned to the court wherein it originated.<\/div><\/div>",

The judgment against Vicente Ladia is reversed, and\u00a0 he is acquitted of the complaint.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to any party in this court.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J., Torres, Mapa,Johnson, Carson, <\/i>and <i>Tracey, JJ., <\/i>concur. <\/div>",

Some days thereafter Calixto Balubal, the owner of the lost carabaos, discovered the head of one of the animals in the lot of the defendant, Tomas Molina, and swore out a search warrant, in the court of the justice of the peace, by virtue of which a search was made in Molina's house, and a considerable portion of the carcass of one or more carabaos, divided into quarters, was discovered in and near his\u00a0 house.\u00a0 One of the witnesses testified that while the owner of the carabao was procuring the search warrant, he was left to keep watch\u00a0 on the head, meat, and bones, which were found in the yard of Tomas Molina, and that he saw the defendants, Tomas Molina, Sixto Beran, and one Cipriano de Asis, carrying a quantity of carabao meat from under the house into the yard where they left it.<br\/><br\/>The defendants did not go upon the witness stand nor offer any explanation as to why the head of the carabao belonging to the complaining witness was found in the yard of Tomas Molina, or why so large a quantity of carabao meat was found in and about his house.<br\/><br\/>We think the foregoing facts which were conclusively established by the testimony of record constitute prima facie proof of the fact that the lost carabaos of the complaining witness, valued at 300, were stolen\u00a0 by Tomas Molina, the owner of the house, in whose possession\u00a0 the meat was found, and no evidence having been\u00a0 offered in rebuttal of this presumption of guilt, the court properly convicted the said Tomas Molina of the crime of theft with which he was charged.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Gimeno, 3 Phil. Rep., 233; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Paguio, 6 Phil. Rep., 436; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Soriano, 9 Phil. Rep. 441.)<br\/><br\/>We do not think, however, that the guilt of the defendant, Sixto\u00a0 Beran, was proven beyond a\u00a0 reasonable doubt.\u00a0 The only evidence against him was the testimony of the witness who stated that he had seen this defendant and\u00a0 Tomas\u00a0 Molina carrying some of the carabao meat which was found upon Molina's lot, from under the house. This defendant is a nephew of Tomas Molina, and while the fact that he\u00a0 was\u00a0 assisting\u00a0 Molina in carrying\u00a0 the meat out of the house was a very suspicious circumstance, and tends strongly to raise a suspicion of guilt as to him, nevertheless as the meat was not found in his house or under his control, and as it does not appear that he had any knowledge of the origin of the meat or his uncle's object in\u00a0 removing it from the house, we do not think that it can be said that he is guilty of\u00a0 the theft of\u00a0 the meat beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 The presumption of guilt of the crime of theft, which arises from\u00a0 the unexplained possession of stolen goods soon after the time when the theft was committed, can not be legitimately extended beyond the person in whose possession and under whose control such property is found, and the mere fact that other persons may have assisted him, at his request, in dealing with such stolen property, does not necessarily imply that such persons rendered such assistance knowing the property to be stolen, or that they themselves were parties to the theft.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction and the sentence of the trial court, in so far as they\u00a0 affect the defendant Sixto Beran, should be and are hereby reversed, and this defendant is hereby acquitted, with his one-half share of the cost of both instances\u00a0 <i>de oficio<\/i> and he will be set at liberty forthwith.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction and the sentence of the trial court, in so far as they affect the defendant, Tomas Molina, should be and are hereby affirmed, with\u00a0 one-half the costs of this instance against\u00a0 this defendant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Torres, Mapa, Willard,<\/i>\u00a0 and <i>Tracey, JJ.,<\/i> <\/div>",

The court, finally, erred in entering judgment against the defendants and in favor of the plaintiff, holding that the latter, as administrator of the intestate estate of his father, Faustino Llacer, is the true owner of the land in question; and that the said plaintiff, as owner, shall take charge and administer the aforesaid property. And also erred in sentencing the defendant, Francisco Mu\u00f1oz, to pay all the costs of the suit.\"<\/blockquote>During the trial of the cause in the lower court the plaintiff attempted to show that his father and mother had acquired the parcel of land in question by purchase, and presented documents for the purpose of sustaining his claim. The documents which were introduced to sustain this claim of the plaintiff were Exhibits B, C, D, F, and G. Each of these documents was a deed to different parts of land which make up the total of the land in question. There was some question during the trial with reference to the admissibility of a note found at the foot of Exhibit 6, by which Pio Balana attempted to transfer to the father of the plaintiff a portion of the land in question. We deem it unnecessary to discuss the admissibility of this note in evidence, because by virtue of the view which we take of the case, its admissibility or rejection is a matter of no importance.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Mu\u00f1oz during the trial of the case presented Exhibits 7 and 8, which were deeds executed by the said Faustino Llacer and Pio Balana, respectively, to all of the land in question, to Antonio Mu\u00f1oz, upon the 20th day of April, 1877, and that Francisco Mu\u00f1oz e hijos were the successors in interest of the said Antonio Mu\u00f1oz and Francisco Mu\u00f1oz de Bustillo respectively. The deeds represented by Exhibits 7 and 8 were apparently duly executed before a notary public and were duly registered in the registry of lands. The plaintiff does not attempt to show that they were not so duly executed, delivered, and recorded. He does attempt to show, however, that said deeds were executed and delivered to Antonio Mu\u00f1oz for the purpose of defrauding the then Government.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff attempts to prove, without alleging the fact, that his father, Faustino Llacer, and Pio Balana were <i>cabezas de barangay<\/i>, and as such <i>cabezas<\/i> were under obligation to pay to the Government certain taxes or assessments, and that the deeds marked Exhibits 7 and 8, by which they each conveyed to Antonio Mu\u00f1oz not only the property in question but many other parcels of land, together with certain personal property, were made for the purpose of defeating the collection of such assessments. The statements of the plaintiff upon this point are supported by the testimony of Rufino Nieves. The evident intention of the plaintiff by this testimony was to set at naught or to nullify the said deeds represented by Exhibits 7 and 8. This was an action to recover the possession of land by the plaintiff upon the theory that he was the owner. Had the plaintiff desired to set aside the contracts of conveyance made by his father, he should have instituted a special action for that purpose, (Arts. 1300 to 1314, Civil Code.) He can not have said documents annulled in a subsidiary action. Moreover the very evidence which he introduced for the purpose of nullifying the said documents, would serve to defeat the nullification of said documents in an action brought for that specific purpose. (Arts. 1305, and 1306, Civil Code.) One who desires to recover lands as the owner from another upon the theory that the deeds held by the other are null and void, must first ask that such alleged fraudulent deeds be set aside.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff in his brief undertakes to show that the defendant had not obtained title to the land in question, by virtue of Exhibits 7 and 8, by the fact that his father had not obtained title to a portion of the said land until 1881, or some years after the alleged deed to Antonio Mu\u00f1oz. Exhibit F and the note to Exhibit B seem to support this contention. Granting, however, that he did not obtain a portion of the land until some years after he had sold such land to Antonio Mu\u00f1oz, his subsequent acquisition of the land would have the effect of making his conveyance of the same to Mu\u00f1oz valid.<br\/><br\/>A portion of the land in question which the defendant claims he acquired from Pio Balana in 1877, was by the note to Exhibit B transferred to the father of the plaintiff in 1885. Exhibit 8 is a deed executed and delivered in regular form on the 20th day of April, 1877, by Pio Balana to a portion of the land in question to Antonio Mu\u00f1oz. This deed apparently conveys all of the interest which Pio Balana had in such tract of land. By the note found at the foot of \"Exhibit B,\" Pio Balana attempts again to transfer the said land to Faustino Llacer. The note does not seem to have been executed before a notary public, neither was it registered, and even though it had been executed in due form, it could by no means transfer to Faustino Llacer any interest in said land for the reason that Pio Balana had transferred all of his interest in said land to Antonio Mu\u00f1oz, by the deed in 1877 (Exhibit 8), duly executed and delivered.<br\/><br\/>No question was raised with reference to the claim that the land which Antonio Mu\u00f1oz originally acquired in the manner above indicated, and which subsequently became the property of Francisco Mu\u00f1oz de Bustillo, now belongs to Francisco Mu\u00f1oz e hijos.<br\/><br\/>From all the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause relating to the ownership of the land, we are convinced that there is a preponderance of evidence .showing that the defendant or Francisco Mu\u00f1oz 6 hijos, are now the owners of the land in question.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the house claimed by Maxima Narito situated upon said land, the lower court found that said house belonged to the said Maxima Narito. An examination of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause seems to justify this conclusion of the lower court. The judgment of the lower court therefore with reference to the ownership of the house located upon said land is hereby affirmed.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court by which the plaintiff, Luis Llacer, is declared to be the owner of the land in question, is hereby reversed. After the expiration of the time specified by the rules of this court, let judgment be entered in favor of the defendant Francisco Mu\u00f1oz 6 hijos, declaring them to be the owners of the land in question.

Since the appeal, the plaintiffs, Justo\u00a0 Mendoza y Crespo and Ruperta Mendoza y Crespo, have died, and by an order of this court Do\u00f1a Constancia Salinas as administratrix of Justo Mendoza y Crespo and as administratrix of Ruperta Mendoza y Crespo, was duly substituted as a plaintiff herein.<br\/><br\/>The defendants introduced in\u00a0 the court below a large amount of documentary evidence and also produced various witnesses.\u00a0 The judgment of that court, however, was based, not upon this evidence thus produced by the defendants but upon the fact that\u00a0 the plaintiffs had not shown any title to or interest in the land in question and that the defendants, being in possession, the plaintiffs could not, therefore, recover.\u00a0 In the view we have taken of the case, it is necessary to consider only the evidence offered by the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>First, as to the documentary evidence, it is said in the assignment of errors that the court erred in rejecting documentary evidence\u00a0 presented by the plaintiffs.\u00a0 We do not find in\u00a0 the record any such ruling; in fact, as we understand the case, all of the papers presented by the plaintiffs were admitted by\u00a0 the judge.\u00a0 In any\u00a0 event, we have considered all the documents which the record contains thus presented\u00a0 and they do not, with one exception, show that the plaintiffs ever had any interest in any of the\u00a0 land described\u00a0 or attempted to be described in the complaint and amended complaint.\u00a0 Of the fourteen documents thus presented,\u00a0 all but one relate to or grow out of a certain summary action\u00a0 for the recovery\u00a0 of money <i>(juicio ejecutiro)<\/i> commenced in 1888 by Saturnino Espejo against Simplicia Crespo.\u00a0 This action, being for the recovery of money, had nothing to do with the land in question, but when the plaintiff in that action desired to seize property for the purpose of satisfying his debt, the attachment was levied upon certain land as\u00a0 the property of Simplicia Orespo, which land the plaintiffs claim is the land involved in this action. The levy thus made was at the indication of Bonifacio Mendoza, one of the\u00a0 present\u00a0 plaintiffs.\u00a0\u00a0 We do not see how\u00a0 the fact that in\u00a0 the action of Saturnino Espejo against Simplicia Crespo, Bonifacio\u00a0 Mendoza, son of Simplicia Crespo, indicated\u00a0 that\u00a0 the land in\u00a0 question belonged to his\u00a0 mother, and the additional fact that for that reason an attachment was levied upon the same, is any proof that the land was in\u00a0 fact\u00a0 her property.\u00a0 No document\u00a0 whatever was produced by the plaintiffs showing any grant of this or any other land to them or to their mother, and\u00a0 their whole claim, so\u00a0 far as the documentary\u00a0 evidence is concerned, rests entirely upon the proceedings taken in this action of Espejo against their mother.<br\/><br\/>When the attachment was levied, Lino Reyes, the principal defendant in\u00a0 this case, claiming to own fourteen parcels\u00a0 of the\u00a0 land thus\u00a0 seized,\u00a0 brought\u00a0 three\u00a0 summary proceedings to recover the possession\u00a0 thereof,\u00a0 in all\u00a0 of which he was successful.\u00a0 Notwithstanding- this fact,\u00a0 he Avas compelled to intervene in the principal action in which the attachment was levied which was pending in the Court of Intramuros in the city of Manila and to carry on litigation\u00a0 against Saturnino\u00a0 Kwpejo\u00a0 and Simplicia Crespo\u00a0 to vindicate his rights to the property.\u00a0 In this litigation\u00a0 he was successful and a final judgment was entered declaring that he was entitled to the property mentioned in his claim of intervention.<br\/><br\/>Simplicia Crespo paid her debt to Saturnino Espejo and the action commenced by the latter was dismissed on July 1, 1893.\u00a0 Upon such dismissal, an order was made directing the discharge of the attachment and ordering the property\u00a0 attached to\u00a0 be returned to Simplicia\u00a0 Crespo.\u00a0 This order was made in a proceeding to which\u00a0 no one of the present defendants was a party.\u00a0 We find no documentary evidence in the case, however, to show that this order was ever carried into effect, or that the plaintiffs were ever put into possession of any of the property thus attached.\u00a0 In fact, Lino Reyes at that time had\u00a0 a final judgment to the effect that he was entitled to the possession of 14 parcels of land.\u00a0 In their brief in this court the appellants apparently do not claim that possession\u00a0 was ever given\u00a0 to them by virtue of this order.\u00a0 They say that apparently as a resitlt of one of these old actions the possession of the property was in fact returned to the plaintiffs in the month of April, 1896.\u00a0 This was by virtue of another order to which we shall refer later.<br\/><br\/>On the 8th of February, 1895, Bonifacio Mendoza presented a motion in the intervention proceeding of Lino Reyes in which he alleged that more land had been delivered to Lino Reyes than he was entitled to by virtue of his judgment; and that he had been put in possession of certain lands in the sitio of Socol, which sitio was not mentioned in the final judgment, and he asked that the proceeding relating to the execution of that judgment be declaimed void. Lino\u00a0 Reyes, in the proceeding that followed, alleged, and as we think proved, that the property in Socol was in fact included in his complaint of intervention and in the subsequent\u00a0 sequent proceedings, but that by a clerical error this particular place was omitted in the final judgment.\u00a0 Judgment was\u00a0 rendered in this last\u00a0 proceeding instituted by Bonifacio Mendoza in his favor.\u00a0 From the judgment Lino Reyes appealed to the <i>audiencia<\/i> and while the case was pending therein the parties settled it by a public document which was signed on the 24th day of March, 1896.\u00a0 This is the only document which\u00a0 in any way indicates that the plaintiffs were the owners of any property in the places mentioned in the complaint.\u00a0 It\u00a0 was signed by Bonifacio Mendoza for himself and for his brothers and sisters, except Ruperta, and it was signed by Lino Reyes.\u00a0 After reciting the proceedings taken in the various suits, the parties finally agree that Lino Reyes is the owner of several tracts of land in Socol and that he is entitled to the possession thereof.\u00a0 These tracts of land amount to more than 11 <i>qui\u00f1iones<\/i>.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 also agreed by Lino Reyes that the other property in Socol belongs to the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>There are several defendants in this\u00a0 case, none of whom claims title under Lino Reyes.\u00a0 This document,\u00a0 therefore, is not proof against any of them and is only proof\u00a0 against Lino Reyes, being an admission on his part of the ownership by the plaintiffs of certain lands.\u00a0 But even as far as Lino Reyes is concerned, this admission can not help the plaintiffs because by the very terms of\u00a0 this document they admitted that he was the-owner of more than 11 <i>qui\u00f1ones<\/i> of land.\u00a0 Their\u00a0 evidence shows that all of the land, of which they now claim he is in the wrongful possession in this same place, amounts to about 14 <i>quinones.<\/i>\u00a0 It is very evident to our minds that the land of which he now is in possession in this place is the same land which the plaintiffs admitted to\u00a0 be his in the settlement of 1896.\u00a0 This document, therefore, does not in any way help the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>After the settlement made between the plaintiffs and Lino Reyes, as before stated, the former instituted a proceeding of voluntary jurisdiction in the Court of First Instance of Intramuros to secure the judicial possession and the survey of the land claimed by them in\u00a0 Hagonoy in accordance with the provisions of Titles XIII and XIV of Book III, being articles 2015 to 2029\u00a0 of the Law of Civil Procedure then\u00a0 in force.\u00a0 In the proceedings taken upon the land on the 27th day of April, 1890, for the purpose of surveying it and giving possession, Angelina del Rosario, Victor Sebastian, a defendant, Juan Floras, another defendant, and (Graciano Reyes, in\u00a0 representation\u00a0 of Lino Reyes, appeared and opposed the survey and the judicial possession.\u00a0 According to the minutes made of the proceeding,\u00a0 the land then under consideration included\u00a0 about\u00a0 98 hectares, or 35 <i>qui\u00f1ones<\/i>.\u00a0 On the 7th day of May, 1896, Juan Flores and Victor Sebastian presented to the Court of First Instance of Intramuros a written objection\u00a0 to further action in this proceeding of voluntary jurisdiction and asked, in accordance with the provisions of article 1800 of the said Law\u00a0 of Civil Procedure that the proceeding be made contentious.\u00a0 The clerk reported to the court that\u00a0 no return had been made by the officials of Bulacan showing what had\u00a0 been done by virtue of the previous order made in the proceeding.<br\/><br\/>The filing of this opposition by Juan Flores and Victor Sebastian terminated the proceedings and what had before been done therein produced no legal effect.\u00a0 It is suggested that in view of the fact that the opposition of Juan Flores and Victor Sebastian related to only a part of the land in controversy,\u00a0 it did not have the effect of terminating the whole proceeding, but article\u00a0 2020\u00a0 provides\u00a0 that when an objection is made which relates to a part of the land in controversy, the proceeding can be continued as to the rest of it\u00a0 if the person who has commenced it so desires, and the other adjoining owners do not object. In this case there is no evidence whatever that Bonifacio Mendoza ever requested\u00a0 that the proceeding continue and no evidence that it ever was continued.\u00a0 The plaintiffs, therefore, acquired no rights by this proceeding\u00a0 of voluntary jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>This is in substance all the documentary evidence that was presented and we have seen that it furnishes no proof of ownership or of any interest whatever on the part of the plaintiffs in the land in controversy.<br\/><br\/>It remains to inquire whether the parol evidence offered showed any such title or interest.\u00a0 If such evidence showed that the plaintiffs had been in actual and physical possession of the land for some time, it would be necessary, under the ruling in the case of the Bishop of Cebu <i>vs.<\/i> Mangaron (6 Phil. Rep., 286), to examine the evidence offered by the defendants, but we think that the evidence does not show any such possession.\u00a0 As to the formal possession given in 1896 in the proceedings of voluntary jurisdiction, it\u00a0 was, so far as the evidence in this case shows, merely momentary. Not only is there no evidence in the case to show that the plaintiffs remained in the actual possession of the property, but their own evidence shows to the contrary.\u00a0 Ruperta Mendoza, one of the plaintiffs, testified that\u00a0 they were in possession only one year after the death of their mother. Gregorio\u00a0 Mendoza, another plaintiff, testified that the plaintiffs were in possession only two years, without specifying the\u00a0 time\u00a0 when they\u00a0 were in such possession.\u00a0\u00a0 The mother of the plaintiffs, Simplicia Crespo, died on the 6th of February, 1892.<br\/><br\/>It is true that the plaintiffs\u00a0 testified that\u00a0 their mother had been in possession for one or two years of some land in this locality, but there is an entire failure to identify the particular tract of land of which they had been so in possession.\u00a0 They said that it was the land in controversy. The original complaint in this action claimed title to a tract of land of about 40 qui\u00f1onies.\u00a0 This was presented in June, 1902.\u00a0 An amended complaint was presented in September, 1902, in which title was claimed to a\u00a0 tract of land containing about 100 <i>qui\u00f1onies<\/i>.\u00a0 It is stated in one of the briefs presented by the appellees that no one of the plaintiffs had any exact idea of the land claimed\u00a0 by them and this statement is not entirely unsupported by the record. Their own evidence showed that 14 <i>qui\u00f1ones<\/i> claimed by them did not, in fact, belong to them.\u00a0 Whether the land which they say their mother occupied for a year before her death and which they say they occupied for a year after her death\u00a0 was this land, which in fact belonged to Lino Reyes, nowhere appears.<br\/><br\/>The evidence presented by the plaintiffs is so vague, much of it answers to leading questions,\u00a0 and so unsatisfactory both as to the time and the exact land possessed by them, that to\u00a0 our minds it is wholly insufficient to prove such a possession as would warrant the maintenance of this action.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

In order to find out whether the other two caraballas had also been hidden by the accused\u00a0 the ransom was paid, and, upon taking the animal over, it was discovered that\u00a0 a\u00a0 new brand, which was still fresh, had been placed over the old one, for which reason information was at\u00a0 once given to the Insular Police and the justice of the peace, and the latter ordered the arrest of the accused.<br\/><br\/>As a result of the investigation made while the accused was detained at the <i>cuartel<\/i> of the Constabulary, he at last stated that the two missing caraballas were at the sitio of Cabatangau, in the\u00a0 pueblo\u00a0 of Granada, where they were actually found by the Constabulary on the bank of a river among the bushes, they\u00a0 also showed\u00a0 signs of having\u00a0 been recently rebranded.<br\/><br\/>Consequently a complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal charging Isidro Jamero with the crime of theft, and proceedings were instituted.\u00a0 The judge, on the 30th of August, 1906, sentenced the\u00a0 accused, as accessory to the crime, to pay a fine of 1,000 pesetas and the costs, and, in case of insolvency, to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, reserving to Figuera, the injured party, his right of action for the P55 paid to the accused, who appealed from said judgment.<br\/><br\/>The above facts fully proven in this cause, constitute the crime of theft described in articles 517, No. 1, and 518 of the Penal Code, because three caraballas owned by Fulgcncio Figuera, kept in a corral with one carabao that was left there, were stolen at a late hour of night on the 20th of April, 1906, no intimidation nor violence\u00a0 being, however, present in the commission of the crime.\u00a0 The disappearance of the caraballas was noticed on the following day and was affirmed by two witnesses who are neighbors of\u00a0 the\u00a0 injured party\u00a0 and knew the stolen animals, and became aware of the fact as residents of the place The total value of the three caraballas was P420.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the fact that the accused pleaded\u00a0 not guilty, alleging that the said caraballas had been caught in his field, which is planted with sugar cane, and that they were delivered to him by Narciso Gavoll at between 6 and 7 p. m. on the 8th of May of said year. the day on which Figuera, the injured party, appeared to claim them, such allegation has not been substantiated; the record contains full and satisfactory evidence of the guilt of the accused as principal of the crime, and also shows that it is not true that the caraballas were found grazing on the field belonging to the accused, notwithstanding the declarations made by himself and by his witnesses.<br\/><br\/>It is not possible to believe that from (he night of April to the afternoon of May 8\u2014that\u00a0 is, during twelve days\u2014three tame caraballas had been\u00a0 wandering over a tract of land extending from the pueblo of Saravia\u00a0 to the capital of Bacolod without being caught by some resident or by an agent of the authorities, or by persons in favor of carabaos, of whom there are so many in\u00a0 the island,\u00a0 as attested by the many cases appealed to this court; if the animals reached Mansiligan, Bacolod, it was because the accused, who had stolen them from their corral, took them there from Tuburan, Saravia.<br\/><br\/>The injured party went to the house of the accused to claim his caraballas during the daytime, not at night, and he then found only one of them, already rebranded; and, in order to secure the other two, which the accused\u00a0 had already hidden away, and for the purpose of obtaining proof thereof\u00a0 (because Alejo Cataluna, who had seen the three caraballas by\u00a0 the side of the stairway at the time when the accused himself was rehratiding them, assured him that\u00a0 they were in the possession\u00a0 of the latter)\u00a0 he acceded to the demand of the accused and handed him P55 as ransom, not as an indemnity for the damage caused to his sugar plantation.<br\/><br\/>When the matter was reported to the Insular Police, to whom\u00a0 the recovered caraballa was presented as evidence, the accused, Jamero, was arrested and after\u00a0 investigation he finally pointed out the place where he had hidden away the two caraballas which\u00a0 were also recovered by the Constabulary, who testified that the new brands put on the three caraballas\u00a0 were of recent date and were in appearance still fresh.\u00a0 This evidence destroys the\u00a0 exculpatory allegations of the accused and proves his culpability; the fact that when the caraballas were seen by the court, in the\u00a0 month of August following, and new marks and the corrections could hardly be noticed on the animals does not\u00a0 counteract the effects of this finding for the reason that, after the lapse of three months, the wounds could have already healed.<br\/><br\/>The stolen caraballas having been found in the possession of the accused, and there\u00a0 being no proof as to who was the thief, it is assumed that the holder or bearer of the stolen\u00a0 property is the author of the theft or robbery; this presumption against the accused has been neither affected nor destroyed by any evidence to the contrary. This doctrine, which is strictly in accord with the principles of the criminal law in such crimes, has already been applied in decisions of this court in appeals from judgments of the said\u00a0 Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the theft the concurrence of the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity, with nothing to mitigate it has been considered; therefore, the penalty should be applied in the maximum degree, with the obligation to refund the 55 paid\u00a0 by the owner of the stolen animals as ransom.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing and accepting the\u00a0 conclusions in the judgment appealed from, which are compatible and agree with the basis of this decision, it is our opinion that the said judgment should be reversed, and that Isidro Jamero be sentenced to three years of <i>presidio correccional<\/i>,\u00a0 to suffer\u00a0 the accessory penalties of article 58 of tin; code,\u00a0 to refund to the injured party, Fulgencio Figuera, the\u00a0 sum of 55, and\u00a0 to\u00a0 pay the costs\u00a0 of both instances.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

O. Jones, who1, accompanied by C. J. Milleron, proceeded to the said town. From the municipal building he sent for the postmaster, but as the latter was not in his house, the investigators proceeded thither. Upon finding that the post-office, which was established in the said house of the accused, was closed, with the consent of his wife they entered it, and then and there found a basket full of waste paper and torn-up letters together with some leaves torn out of a mailing book. By direction of Inspector Jones, Milleron called the justice of the peace, and on his arrival a few minutes later they placed in a box all the papers, books, and other things belonging to the post-office, and after closing and sealing the same deposited it in the court of the justice of the peace. On the following afternoon the box was opened in the presence of the accused and of the justice of the peace; erasures and alterations were discovered in a stub-book, and some pages of the registry of registered letters were found to be destroyed and torn out, besides evidence of other punishable deeds.<br\/><br\/>The provincial fiscal filed a complaint on the 19th of February, 1907, with the Court of First Instance of Batangas, charging Pedro Mari\u00f1o with the crime of infidelity in the custody of documents, and upon the present case being instituted the judge sentenced the accused, on the 2d of March, 1907, to the penalty of eight years and one day of <i>prision mayor<\/i>, to pay Eleuteria Punsalan the sum of P5 stolen from a letter addressed to her, to suffer the accessory penalties, to pay a fine of 3,000 pesetas, to temporary special disqualification for eight years, and to pay the costs of the proceedings. From the said judgment the counsel for the accused has appealed.<br\/><br\/>It results from the proceedings that Pedro Mari\u00f1o, as postmaster stationed in the town of Taal, retained in his possession without forwarding it to the addressee, a registered letter addressed by Juan Castillo, of Bauan, to Perpetuo Venturanza, a resident of Taal; that he opened the said letter and stole therefrom the sum of P27.50. The letter was afterwards found, in the course of investigation, between the pages of a book in his office, and the accused then returned the money to the sender, requesting him not to give evidence against him.<br\/><br\/>He also retained without delivering to Teresa Leonor, three letters addressed to her from Bongao, Moro Province, by Domingo Leonor, a resident of said town, and only delivered them to the addressee on the 31st of December, in consequence of the action taken by certain persons on behalf of the interested party.<br\/><br\/>On the 10th of November, 1906, W. C. Boyer, a Constabulary officer, sent a registered letter to Candida Celedonio, a resident of Aliaga, Nueva Ecija, remitting her P50 in bills, but the addressee did not receive said letter or the money until after the 1st of January, 1907, after the officer had made an investigation as to the whereabouts of the letter; the accused further counterfeited the signature of said officer in the corresponding book of receipts, for a registered letter addressed to the latter.<br\/><br\/>Mariano Medina, a resident of Taal, delivered to the accused one day in the month of November, 1906, an open letter with 50 in bills for Epifanio Elefa\u00f1o of Calamba, and as the latter did not receive the letter with the money, Medina sent him two other letters by mail and two by messenger; of all of which the last-named alone reached him. As Elefa\u00f1o had never received the letters sent by mail, Medina filed his complaint with the Director of Posts, and then in consequence of the complaint, Elefano received on the 24th of December, the letter of November together with the money. One of the letters sent by the said Medina and not received by Elefa\u00f1o was found in the basket by Inspector Jones.<br\/><br\/>Paula Isla, a resident of Taal, after trying several times to find out from the post-office of Taal if any letters had been received for her from her husband residing in Zamboanga, remitting money, received from the accused one day the sum of P20, and on the following day P10 more without receiving any letter from her husband, the accused stating that none had been received; it afterwards ap\u00adpeared that a letter, No. 1001, addressed to Paula Isla, had been receipted for in the receipt book with the name of the latter and a cross, together with a thumb print, all of which Paula Isla denied as hers because she is able to read and write, a fact that was subsequently proven.<br\/><br\/>Among several torn-up letters found in the basket above referred to, and afterwards reassembled, there appears one addressed to Vicente Garcia by his son Leandro Garcia for Maria Angeles, the latter's wife, Leandro inquiring therein whether hie wife had received two previous letters by registered mail, one written in May, and the other in September and containing P25 each; said registered letters had never been received.<br\/><br\/>Eleuteria Punsalan, whose name appears to have been signed in the registered letter book on the 24th of August, 1906, denied having so signed or that she ever received any letter from her uncle, Flaviano Ocampo, inclosing P5 which were stolen by the accused.<br\/><br\/>Among the several letters found in said basket, addressed to persons residing in Taal by residents of other places and vice versa, it results, upon the fragments of the same being assembled, that inquiries were made regarding the whereabouts of registered letters that had not been received.<br\/><br\/>From the above stated and fully proven facts, it is logically inferred that the crime of infidelity in the custody of documents has been committed.<br\/><br\/>Article 360 of the Penal Code reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"The public official who shall steal, destroy, or hide any documents or papers intrusted to him by virtue of his office shall be punished\u2014<br\/><br\/>\"1. With the penalties of <i>prision mayor<\/i> and a fine of from 625 to 6,250 pesetas, provided that a grave injury to a third person or the public interests has resulted from his action.<br\/><br\/>\"2. With those of <i>prision correccional <\/i>in its minimum and medium degrees and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas if the injury to the third person or to the public interests were not grave.<br\/><br\/>\"In either case there shall, furthermore, be imposed the penalty of temporary special disqualification in its maximum degree to perpetual special disqualification,\"<\/blockquote>The accused, Pedro Mari\u00f1o, as postmaster, is an officer or employee of the Bureau of Posts, and by virtue of his office he was intrusted by the administration with the receiving, keeping, dispatch, and coursing of mail matter, both official and private, with the obligation to enter in the corresponding books the letters, parcels, and papers received and forwarded to their destination, and registered letters in particular; it was also his duty to comply with all the regulations, rules, and instructions given by his official superiors; and notwithstanding all this, the accused, neglecting his duties and violating the confidence reposed in him by the Government, committed the deeds described above, together with several other grave crimes, all of which are punishable under the code.<br\/><br\/>It has been clearly proven in the case that the letters enumerated above were received at the post-office in charge of the accused; they were opened, and the sums of money .that they contained were stolen, and although after some months or weeks some of the said amounts were delivered to the addressees or to the owners thereof, it has been noticed that the bills returned were not the same ones that were remitted; such delivery or return being only made in view of a possible prosecution.<br\/><br\/>The simple act of retaining the mail without forwarding the letters to their destination, even though without opening them or stealing the moneys they contained, already constitutes the crime of infidelity on the part of the post-office official, because he, seriously neglecting his duties, stole and concealed several letters, and separated them from the ordinary and legal course which they should follow in order to reach their destination without delay.<br\/><br\/>The supreme court of Spain, applying in its decision of the 5th of July, 1887, the provisions of article 375 of the Benal Code of that country, analogous to article 360 of the code in force in these Islands, on an appeal in cassation in a case similar to the one herein, saw fit to establish the following doctrine:<br\/><blockquote>\"That the custody of packages sent through the national post-office is intrusted by the administration to all the officers of this branch of the public service who intervene in the distribution thereof, it being their bounden duty, and inherent in their respective offices, to remedy mistakes and prevent possible confusion in the mails where any exist; therefore, from the fact that an employee of said department stole a package with declared values which he received mixed up with others, and hid the same without forwarding it to its proper destination, or presenting it to' his chief, he was unfaithful to his office and position of confidence, and committed at least the crime defined in said article 375, which punishes the public functionary who shall steal or hide a document intrusted to him by virtue of his office.\"<\/blockquote>The alterations and corrections found in the books in charge of the accused and for which he was responsible; the tearing out and the destruction of some of the pages of said books; the counterfeiting of the signatures of the addressees of letters; the destruction and disappearance of many of the said letters, proven in a manner by the many complaints received at the Bureau of Posts, to such extreme that he did not transmit a complaint sent by wire to the Director of Posts; all of the above facts, some of which are proven, and others being strongly indicated, corroborate the certainty and reality of the crime at bar committed by the accused, whose responsibility as principal has been fully proven, notwithstanding his denial and unproven exculpatory allegations; the case contains complete evidence, and produces on the mind a full conviction, beyond all reasonable doubt, of the guilt of the accused.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime no mitigating or aggravating circumstance is present; therefore, the proper penalty should be applied in its medium degree.<br\/><br\/>The question set up by the defense and which has to be expressly determined is, that since there has been no serious injury affecting a third person of the public interests, the penalty to be applied to the accused should be the one provided for in No. 2 of article 360 of the Penal Code, instead of that fixed by No. 1 of the said article, which pretension is objected to by the Attorney-General for the reasons stated by him, alleging that the great num\u00adber of deeds performed by the accused, and the alterations and counterfeiting of signatures made in the register, together with the destruction of some of the pages thereof, clearly show the gravity of the injury caused to the public interests.<br\/><br\/>If the injury of which article 360 of the code speaks is to be understood to mean the detriment or material damage suffered in consequence of the crime, it is unquestionable that in order to accurately judge whether the injury caused is grave or less grave, the court must abide by the provisions of articles 503 to 566 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>Although there might be a doubt as to the importance of the injury or damage caused respectively to each of the parties interested in the ordinary or registered letters stolen, hidden, or destroyed by the accused, there is none aw to the effect of the defendant's conduct so far as the public interests are concerned, inasmuch as the frequency and repetition of the losses and disappearance of letters during the time that the accused was in office had caused uneasiness and a certain alarm among many interested parties residing both in the locality and in other provinces; complaints were received by the Director of Posts of the conduct of the accused, and such deeds committed in a post-office contribute to alienate the confidence of the public in a government service of the greatest necessity in social life, thus causing grave injury, of far-reaching effects to the public interests. Therefore, the penalty that should be applied to the author thereof is that prescribed in No. 1 of the said article 300 of the Penal Code in conformity with the jurisprudence established by the aforesaid supreme court in its decisions of the 2d of December, 1895, and 7th of January, 1904.<br\/><br\/>For the considerations above set forth it is our opinion that Pedro Mari\u00f1o should be sentenced to the penalty of eight years and one day of <i>prision mayor<\/i>, to suffer the accessory penalties of article 61, to pay a line of 3,000 pesetas, without subsidiary imprisonment in view of the nature of the penalty, to twelve years temporary special disqualification from public office, right of suffrage, active and passive, profession or occupation, to indemnify Eleuteria Punsalan in the sum of P5, and to pay the costs of this instance; the judgment appealed from being hereby affirmed in so far as it is in conformity herewith and reversed in so far as it is not.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Another witness, Galicano Brusa, said that on a certain day in the year 1903 he received from Jose Sajo P300, which the latter had borrowed from the defendant for the purchase of corn for the use of the workmen of the <i>hacienda<\/i> of Lulubcon.\u00a0 This<i> hacienda <\/i>is the property of the defendant and in the year 1903 was leased to one of the plaintiffs who was in partnership with Jose Sajo in the development of the said hacienda.\u00a0 This last witness did not say for what reason nor for whose account that amount was\u00a0 delivered to Jose by the defendant, nor did he say whether he had personal knowledge of the occurrence, or whether he had heard of it from others; he spoke of it in his testimony as an incidental matter only.\u00a0 His testimony is not and can not, therefore, be conclusive as to the defendant, chiefly because this same witness has specifically stated that he did not know who used to advance money for the expenses of\u00a0 the operation of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">hacienda.<\/span> There is not sufficient evidence of record to the effect that the defendant had advanced, for account of the plaintiffs, any amount to cover such expenses.<br\/><br\/>As to the sum of P500 which, according to the defendant,\u00a0 he loaned the plaintiffs for delivery to Basilio Majinay,\u00a0 the record shows -the positive testimony of\u00a0 Pablo de la Cruz, who affirms that he was present when the amount was\u00a0 delivered by the defendant to the plaintiff Tomasa Juaneza, and that it was in the nature of a loan.\u00a0 The plaintiff himself admits that Tomasa, his wife and coplaintiff herein,\u00a0 borrowed from\u00a0 the defendant the above-mentioned\u00a0 sum of P500, which was delivered to Basilio Majinay; and, although\u00a0 said\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 asserts that the sum was paid by the defendant on account of the Pl,300 which Tomasa had previously given the defendant, nevertheless, such alleged previous delivery to the defendant\u00a0 of a larger sum has not been duly established; and it should be noted, moreover, that, among the various amounts alleged to have been delivered by\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs to\u00a0 the defendant, no mention was made in the complaint itself\u00a0 of the P1,300.\u00a0 The testimony of the witness De la Cruz\u00a0 is positive as to the fact that Tomasa received the\u00a0 said P500 as a loan; \"that sum was borrowed from Gregorio Sajo\" were the words used by\u00a0 the\u00a0 witness when testifying in regard to this matter.\u00a0 The last-named amount must, therefore, be credited to the defendant and deducted from the total amount which the latter is, according to the judgment appealed from, to pay the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>) The judgment for P3,323.60.\u00a0 This debt appears on a <i>vale<\/i> which the defendant signed in favor of the plaintiff Tomasa Juaneza on the 17th of March, 1904.\u00a0 The defendant admits\u00a0 the existence of the debt, but only claims a reduction therefrom of P1,200, which the defendants owe him for rent of his house and land situated in the pueblo of Molo.\u00a0 It is proven that the defendant leased to the plaintiff herein a certain piece of land and a building, owned by himself, in Molo, Province of Iloilo, at the rate of P300 per annum.\u00a0 The contract of lease began in 1900 and was continued at least until 1905.\u00a0 Two witnesses have positively stated that one of the plaintiffs has not paid the rents corresponding to the years 1900, 1901,1902, and 1903.\u00a0 One of said witnesses was intrusted\u00a0 by the defendant with the collection of said rents from the plaintiff.\u00a0 He tried on several occasions\u00a0 to do ,this, his last demand having been made in 1904.\u00a0 He failed in all his efforts, because the plaintiff invariably told him that he (the plaintiff) had no money, and promised to pay\u00a0 some other day, without, however, redeeming his promise.\u00a0 The other witness was present in June, 1904, when the defendant demanded payment from the\u00a0 plaintiff, at the latter's own house, of the rents above referred to, and heard the plaintiff confess\u00a0 hat he\u00a0 had not really paid those rents at that time.\u00a0 The plaintiff himself admitted\u00a0 this fact in his testimony, although he stated that the defendant was indebted to him for the value of several commissions he performed for the\u00a0 former, for which reason, he said, they kept an account-current including the rents and which should show a balance against said defendant.\u00a0 This account was not exhibited at the trial nor was evidence presented to prove the alleged commissions performed by the plaintiff\u00a0 and the value\u00a0 thereof.\u00a0 In view of the evidence, we find\u00a0 that the plaintiff is\u00a0 indebted\u00a0 to\u00a0 the defendant in the\u00a0 sum of P1,200, the aggregate amount of said rents, which must be deducted from the total sum awarded to the\u00a0 plaintiffs by the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>The lower court found that the question relative to the claim for the payment of those rents could not be settled in\u00a0 the present action, \"on account of another action previously commenced by Sajo\u00a0 against Boga in the court of the justice of the peace of Iloilo, which court has jurisdiction of the case, it being\u00a0 for the payment of rents due and for the recovery of possession of a leased property, situated in the city of Iloilo, province of the same name.\"<br\/><br\/>This reasoning of the judge includes, as we understand it, two questions, <i>lis pendens<\/i> and the jurisdiction of the court.\u00a0 In regard to the first question, it is true that, on July 10, 1905, the defendant brought suit against the plaintiff before the justice of the peace of Iloilo for the recovery of the possession of said land and building; but it is also true that the only rents whose payment is claimed in the complaint filed in that\u00a0 suit were those corresponding to 1904, said complaint containing a\u00a0 statement that the <i>proper claim had already been filed to secure payment of the rents corresponding to the years 1900,1901,1902, and 1903, and that said claim was pending before the courts,<\/i> and this statement undoubtedly refers to the present action, which was\u00a0 brought one\u00a0 year before the filing of that complaint, and in which payment of said rents was demanded by means of a counterclaim.\u00a0 It does not appear that another action has been brought to secure payment of those rents, and consequently there is no such <i>lis pendens <\/i>as is seemingly referred to in the judgment of the lower court.<br\/><br\/>The object of the present action being the collection.of rents due, independent of the action for ejectment, and of which no mention is made herein, it is evident that the court below had jurisdiction to try and pass upon that question in spite of the fact that the property leased is situated in another judicial\u00a0 district.\u00a0 The action for the\u00a0 collection of rents can be jointly brought with the action for ejectment, and in consequence thereof, or separately and in an action that has nothing to do with ejectment.\u00a0\u00a0 In the first\u00a0 case, the justice of the peace of\u00a0 the locality where the real property which is the subject-matter of the action is located, has jurisdiction thereof, according to the provisions of sections 80 and 81 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which vest said functionary with exclusive jurisdiction to try actions for ejectment on account of nonpayment of rents.\u00a0 In the second case, as the action is of a personal nature, and as there is no statutory provision to the contrary, it can be brought in the province where either the defendant or the plaintiff is a resident, at the latter's option, according to section 377 of the code. In this latter case, according to the provisions of sections 56 and 68 of Act No. 136, the\u00a0 amount of the rent will determine whether the case will come within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance or of\u00a0 the court of the\u00a0 justice of the peace.\u00a0 As the\u00a0 rents claimed herein amount to P1,200, it was incumbent upon the lower court to hear and make findings thereon; and error was, therefore, committed by not doing so on the ground of supposed lack of jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court is affirmed, it being understood that the total sum which the defendant must pay the plaintiffs for the reasons therein set forth shall be only P2,523.60, with the legal interest, at 6 per cent per\u00a0 annum, which has accrued or may accrue from the 19th of April, 1904, the date of the filing of the complaint, without special ruling as to the\u00a0 costs of this appeal.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

These facts are clearly proven in the case, and the accused being found guilty of the crime of illegal marriage was sentenced by the court to the penalty of nine years and one day of imprisonment with hard labor, and to pay the costs of the proceedings.<br\/><br\/>The only exculpation alleged by the accused is that his first wife had been absent for more than seven successive years, that her whereabouts were not known, and that for said reason he was able to lawfully contract the second marriage in accordance with the provisions of the last paragraph of section 3 of General\u00a0 Orders, No. 68, which reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A subsequent\u00a0 marriage contracted by any person during the life of a former husband or wife of such person, with any person other than such former husband or wife, is illegal and void from the beginning, unless:<br\/><br\/>\"1. The former marriage has been annulled or dissolved.<br\/><br\/>\"2. Unless such former husband or wife was absent and not known to such person to be living for the space of seven successive\u00a0 years immediately preceding such subsequent marriage, or was generally reputed and was believed\u00a0 by such person to be dead at the time such\u00a0 subsequent marriage\u00a0 was contracted; in either of which\u00a0 cases the subsequent marriage is valid until its nullity is adjudged by a competent tribunal.\"<\/blockquote>It appears from the evidence that the accused married his first wife in the town of Navotas\", and lived with her in the same pueblo for several years.\u00a0 Being pursued by the <i>Guardia Civil<\/i> for political reasons, probably in 1896 or 1897 (the year is not specifically stated), he absented himself from\u00a0 said pueblo in order to avoid arrest, and did not return until the time he\u00a0 was prosecuted.\u00a0 His wife continued to reside in Navotas and,\u00a0 although she searched for the accused for some time through the provinces, she did not obtain any information as to his whereabouts.\u00a0\u00a0 It is positively affirmed that in January, 1907, when the accused contracted the second marriage, she still resided\u00a0 at Navotas.<br\/><br\/>According to the above, it is not true that the wife of the accused had\u00a0 been absent during seven successive years, as affirmed by the defense; the party who was really absent was the accused who since 1896 or 1897 did not return\u00a0 to the town where he resided.\u00a0 His wife remained there where he had left her with the exception of the time she spent\u00a0 in his search.\u00a0 As to the effects of General Orders, No. 68, the <i>absent consort<\/i> would in this case be the accused, and his wife the<i> consort present.<\/i>\u00a0 In the sense of the said legal provision, an absent\u00a0 person is one whose whereabouts and existence are not known, because the presumption of death in such cases of absence is necessarily based thereon.\u00a0 The whereabouts of the wife in this case were well known to the accused because she was at the same place where he left her when he parted company with her eleven years ago.\u00a0 She was there when the accused contracted the second marriage.\u00a0 As it is, there is lacking in the present case the essential condition prescribed\u00a0 in the above-mentioned provision, which\u00a0 consists of the <i>absence<\/i> of the consort which is presumed or assumed, in accordance with the law, because the existence and whereabouts of the person during seven successive years have remained unknown.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing it may be gathered that it would have been extremely easy for the accused to have obtained news regarding his first wife, if he had so desired it.\u00a0 To that end he would have had to do no more than look for her in the same pueblo of Navotas where he left her, and the said pueblo was but a very short distance from Manila where he lived and married for the second time.\u00a0 Under such circumstances he can not in good faith allege, as he pretends in his brief, that during seven successive years he had no news of the whereabouts of his first wife.<br\/><br\/>And inasmuch as the accused has neither offered any proof that his first wife was generally thought to be dead, and that he so believed at the time of contracting the second marriage, he can not successfully invoke in his favor\u00a0 the legal provision quoted above, under whatever aspect the same is considered.<br\/><br\/>It may be added that the accused stated to the minister who solemnized his second marriage that he was a bachelor, as attested by one of the eyewitnesses to the ceremony; this fact evinces once\u00a0 more the bad faith with which he acted\u00a0 upon contracting the said second marriage.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, provided, however, that the\u00a0 imprisonment\u00a0 imposed on\u00a0 the accused shall be without hard labor, for the reason that the Penal Code does not prescribe it in cases of imprisonment even in the case of <i>prision mayor<\/i> which is the penalty imposed by article 471 of the code applicable in this case, with the costs of this instance against him.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

It\u00a0 is plain that it was unnecessary to show that the municipal council of Tagbilaran had ever\u00a0 licensed cockpits in\u00a0 order to bring them\u00a0 within the terms\u00a0 of\u00a0 Act No.\u00a0 663, for, as cockpits are therein especially\u00a0 mentioned, they are\u00a0 not required to be covered by the phrase \"or other\u00a0 permitted games and amusement whatever may be its technical\u00a0 construction.

Rep., 475.)<br\/><br\/>None of the assignments of error made by the appellant can be sustained except the first one, but that, we think, is well founded.\u00a0 Plaintiff\u00a0 alleged in his complaint that he was the duly appointed judicial administrator of the property of the deceased, Ramon Valencia, and that he duly qualified for that office and was discharging the duties thereof.\u00a0 The answer denied each and every allegation of the complaint.\u00a0 This was a sufficient denial of the allegation of the appointment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the plaintiff\u00a0 as administrator. We have examined the record and we find, as claimed by the appellant, that there is no evidence whatever relating to this appointment.\u00a0 The defendant having denied it, it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to offer proof thereof. It is said by the appellee in his brief that the defendant, by failing to demur to the complaint, waived this proof, but it is very apparent that a demurrer, so far from raising the question as to the appointment, would have\u00a0 admitted it, there being an allegation in the complaint to that effect.<br\/><br\/>For this error the judgment must be reversed, but the ends of justice require that a new trial should be granted to enable the plaintiff to remedy this defect in his evidence.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed\u00a0 and the case is remanded for a new trial Without special ruling as to costs in this second instance.\u00a0 Upon such new trial, it will not be necessary to retake the evidence already presented, but either party will be at liberty to present such other evidence as he sees fit So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

Moreover there was a failure to prove fraud, vitiating the sale, the defendant having established the payment of an apparently good consideration for the transfer.\u00a0 (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain of June 15, 1897.)<br\/><br\/>There is a defect in the certification of the stenographer's notes to which objection was\u00a0 taken by the appellant and a motion, made too late, to postpone the hearing of the case in order to procure a signature by the official stenographer.\u00a0 This motion the respondent opposed, and it is suggested that by this opposition he waived the defect. Whether or not such be the effect of his opposition becomes of no consequence, for the judgment standing alone, without\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony,\u00a0 can\u00a0 not be sustained\u00a0 for the\u00a0 reason that 4 the judge has not found as a fact either that the plaintiff had no other remedy, or that there was\u00a0 a deficiency of assets, nor are there any such allegations in the pleadings.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the Court of First Instance is hereby reversed, and the defendant is absolved, without costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

I., the said Torcuata Gomez, maliciously, and feloniously, and being then lawfully married to Fabiano Martinez Lao, without the said marriage having been in any manner dissolved, attempted to lie and did lie with Ramon Narciso Coronel; knowing that the said Torcuata Gomez is a married woman whose marriage is not dissolved, he lay with her, and afterwards lived in marital relations with her in the same house in the said municipality of Oroquieta, with public scandal, all contrary to law.\u2014Jimenez, Province of Misamis, this the 18th day of January, 1908.\u2014 (Signed) Jose de la Rama, provincial fiscal of Surigao, Misamis, and Agusan.\"<\/blockquote>The case was proceeded with through all its stages against both the accused; the husband as the aggrieved party did not file any charge, although he testified as a witness in the case. On the 25th of January, 1908, the trial judge, considering that the crime of adultery had been proven and that the guilt of the accused Torcuata Gomez and Ramon Narciso Coronel had been established, sentenced each one of them to the penalty of three years, six months, and twenty-one days of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, to the accessory penalties, and costs. From said judgment the accused have appealed.<br\/><br\/>In this case it has been fully proven that Ramon Narciso Coronel, by reason of his living in the house of Torcuata Gomez, a woman lawfully married to Fabiano Martinez, contracted with her illicit and hence adulterous relations which lasted for a period of seventeen months, from April, 1906, to September, 1907. There being, no necessity of considering the allegations of the defense, this decision will be limited to deciding whether, in view of the fact that no complaint was brought by the aggrieved husband, Fabiano Martinez Lao, it would be lawful to sustain the proceedings and the condemnatory judgment appealed from, merely by virtue of the complaint presented by the provincial fiscal of Misamis.<br\/><br\/>Proceedings instituted for crimes defined and punished by the Penal Code in force are regulated by the law of criminal procedure, that is, General Orders No. 58, and that law recognizes as an exception the right of the offended party in crimes of a private nature, in respect to which the provisions of the Penal Code were still in force; in the application of said provisions, as regards the prosecution, those of the former law of procedure have continued to be observed, since they are in perfect harmony with the code now in force, and the public prosecutor is under no obligation to prosecute, among other crimes of a private nature, that of adultery, which is defined in article 433 of the Penal Code, since the offended husband alone is entitled to bring such action before the courts. Article 434 of the said code reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"No penalty shall be imposed for the crime of adultery except upon the complaint of the aggrieved husband.<br\/><br\/>\"The latter can enter a complaint against both guilty parties, if alive, and never, if he has consented to the adultery or pardoned either of the culprits.\"<\/blockquote>So that, under the provisions of the foregoing article, no complaint or charge having been presented by the husband, Fabiano Martinez, against the parties accused of said crime, no valid judgment could be entered nor could any proceedings be brought, against them, in view of the fact that proceedings are instituted in order to prosecute for a crime and to punish the guilty; the absence of a complaint or charge by the aggrieved husband can not be substituted by the complaint filed by the provincial fiscal of Misamis as such a substitution is not authorized by law.<br\/><br\/>Such has always been the constant and genuine interpretation of the provision of the criminal law in relation to this crime, according to the doctrine laid down by the supreme court of Spain when applying a similar article of the Penal Code of that country, as appears in its decisions of January 17, 1874, and January 16, 1875.<br\/><br\/>The crime in question was committed prior to the enforcement of Act No. 1773 of the Philippine Commission, which went into effect on the 11th of October, 1907. Although the complaint was filed by the fiscal on the 18th of January, 1908, it is not lawful to attribute retroactive effects to the said Act of the Philippine Commission for the reason that, even though it refers to a matter of procedure, it does not contain any clause making it retroactive in its effects, and furthermore, the provisions thereof if applied now are prejudicial to the accused.<br\/><br\/>Hence, in view of the terms of the aforesaid article 433 of the Penal Code, the proceedings instituted by virtue of the complaint filed by the fiscal can not be sustained, as they were brought without the necessary previous complaint of the aggrieved husband, and in violation of the criminal law; therefore, the said proceedings, together with the judgment rendered therein, are decidedly null and void.<br\/><br\/>On these grounds all the proceedings in this case, together with the judgment appealed from, are hereby held to be null and void; the bond executed by the accused is set aside with costs <i>de oficio<\/i>.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The last of them, Domingo Castillo, died more than thirty years ago and this litigation has arisen between descendants of the second and third degrees, the plaintiff alleging that in 1903 all the members of the family agreed upon a partition which was carried into effect in 1907 by certain deeds which are in evidence. It seems that none of the defendants took part in this partition nor had they any knowledge, of it, one witness, Epifanio Atienza, saying that, while none of the other heirs of that part of the family were present, he, as the eldest male, assumed to represent the rest of that branch and to divide the land for them. Apparently he held no power to that effect, either written or oral.<br\/><br\/>The Court of First Instance put its judgment upon the ground of prescription in favor of the defendants, but this, we think, was error. It is plain, however, that the defendants are not bound by an operation in which they took no part, and for that reason the plaintiff can not succeed in recovering the exclusive possession of the land occupied by them, which is the object of his action. Upon this ground the judgment of the court below dismissing the action is hereby affirmed, leaving both plaintiff and defendants to assert in a proper way whatever rights may have originally been theirs in the property in suit, whether as tenants in common or otherwise.<br\/><br\/>As hereby modified, the judgment is affirmed, with the costs of this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The judge erred in omitting in his consideration of this action, the provisions of Act No. 1332 of the Philippine Commission, upon the marking and registration of cattle.\"<\/blockquote>First. The provision\u00a0 of the third subdivision of article 612 of the Civil Code reads:.<br\/><blockquote>\"The owner of tamed animals may also claim them within twenty days, counted from the date of their retention by another.\u00a0 After this period has elapsed, they shall belong to the person who may have caught and kept them.\"<\/blockquote>It is a misconception to apply this provision to animals that have not strayed or been abandoned\u00a0 so\u00a0 as to have been taken possession of by another in default\u00a0 of the lawful possessor.\u00a0 These animals were delivered\u00a0 to the defendant by the person\u00a0 in lawful custody of them and the provision cited has no application to such\u00a0 a case, nor is it altogether clear that they fall within the term \"tamed or domestic\" (<i>amansados<\/i>).\u00a0 Sr,\u00a0 Manresa's commentary throws much light upon the object and force of this article.<br\/><br\/>We are unable to agree with the trial judge in applying to this case the prescription under the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 Inasmuch as the period of\u00a0 the cause of\u00a0 action was running when that law went into effect, the\u00a0 proper prescription was the preexisting\u00a0 one of\u00a0 three years, under article\u00a0 1955\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Civil Code.\u00a0 The\u00a0 rule\u00a0 laid down\u00a0 in Aranetat <i>vs.<\/i> Garrido (5 Phil Rep.,137), for the prescription under, the prior law, when the Civil Code went into effect, holds good in\u00a0 the substitution for that code of the more recent Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>Second. Act No. 1332 of\u00a0 the Philippine\u00a0 Commission, cited by counsel, is one amendatory of Act No. 1147, and section 35 of this Act, to which he appears to refer, makes the possession of cattle not branded or\u00a0 registered the presumptive evidence of ownership only\u00a0 \"for the purposes of the section immediately preceding.'The only purpose to be carried out by section 34\u00a0 would seem to be the punishment by fine or imprisonment of persons\u00a0 refusing or neglecting to brand\u00a0 or register, and this restriction prevents the section from having any bearing on the facts now before us.\u00a0 Moreover, the presumption of ownership established by section 35 must\u00a0 be understood to be, not conclusive, but rather a disputable one,\u00a0 in\u00a0 harmony with the provisions of section 8 of the same Act, which\u00a0 makes the certificate of ownership of registered cattle only <i>prima facie <\/i>evidence\u00a0 that the animal is the property of the person therein named as owner.\u00a0 It would not be consistent that the mere possession of unregistered cattle should\u00a0 create a presumption stronger than the due registration by the apparent owner.<br\/><br\/>Both assignments of error\u00a0 are overruled, and the judgment of the Court, of First\u00a0 Instance is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

and that judgment be entered\u00a0 therein in favor of the plaintiff company, authorizing the same\u00a0 to pay to the sheriff, of Manila, or to any of the defendants who may be\u00a0 entitled thereto, the sum of P2,279.67, in full satisfaction of the judgment rendered in the said case No. 2485; and that, upon such payment, the said preliminary injunction be made perpetual, and that costs be allowed, together with any other just and equitable relief.<br\/><br\/>Upon bond in the amount, of P2,000 having been furnished, the preliminary writ of injunction applied\u00a0 for was issued on the same date.<br\/><br\/>The defendants, on being notified, summoned, and cited to appear on the 4th of the said month, interposed a demurrer alleging that the facts set out by the complaint did not constitute a cause of action, and that the said complaint was ambiguous, unintelligible, and vague.\u00a0 On the 16th of the said month the demurrer was sustained, and, although in accordance with the law the injunction should have been dissolved, the court below, however, ordered the same continued pending the appeal that the plaintiff might interpose.\u00a0 The plaintiff company excepted thereto and informed the court and the defendants that it preferred not to amend its former complaint; thereupon the court below entered judgment in favor of the defendants on the 24th of December of the same year, dismissing the complaint with costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the plaintiff company excepted to the above decision, and immediately moved for a new trial\u00a0 on the ground that said judgment was contrary to law; the motion was overruled on the 4th of January, 1908, and the appellant company at once gave notice of its intention to present and perfect a bill of exceptions, in order that the same might be certified and approved.<br\/><br\/>The appellant company after claiming in its brief that the court below erred in having admitted the demurrer offered to its complaint by counsel for defendants, and in having dismissed the said complaint, concluded by asking the repeal of the order sustaining the demurrer, inasmuch as Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. are entitled to exemption from the liability imposed in case No. 2485 by placing in the hands of the sheriff, for delivery to the claimants, the sum of P2,279.67, received as freight of the steamship <i>Kudat<\/i>, and earned on the voyage during which the loss of the lorcha <i>Nevada<\/i> took place, without however, making delivery of the said steamer and her equipment.<br\/><br\/>In the main case cited above, Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. were sentenced to pay the sum of P9,000 to Jose Guzman, the owner of the said lorcha, for the loss thereof; in this new litigation they claim to limit the\u00a0 liability fixed by, the executory judgment, and to be authorized to comply therewith by delivering the said amount and\u00a0 to\u00a0 be\u00a0 thereby exempted from the remainder of the liability.<br\/><br\/>As foundation for this new pretension the second part of article 587 of the Code of Commerce is invoked, and the following question is submitted: Does the exemption provided in\u00a0 article 587 constitute a defense against the liability, or\u00a0 a means of exoneration therefrom?\u00a0 After a disquisition on the laws of the United States and of some countries in Europe on\u00a0 the liability of the <i>naviero<\/i> or owner of the vessel, counsel for the plaintiffs expresses his opinion that the exemption provided for by the said\u00a0 article of\u00a0 the Code of Commerce does not constitute a defense against an action based on the first clause of said article, but a means of exoneration from liability determined by a judicial decision.<br\/><br\/>If this question had been set up in the said litigation No. 2485, it would have been duly resolved, as it should, in\u00a0 the judgment; but the firm of Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. did not allege any such exemption, nor the right or means granted by the second part of article 587 of the Commercial Code above alluded to; but in answering the complaint, they simply denied all and every one of the allegations contained in the complaint of the owner of the lost lorcha, and after a final and executory judgment was rendered in saidcase, the action of the court was limited to the execution and enforcement of the final judgment in all of its parts and in accordance with its express orders.<br\/><br\/>The provisions of the Civil Code and those of the Code of Commerce agree in fixing the liability of the person who, being at the head of an enterprise or business establishment, places\u00a0 or selects another to\u00a0 manage\u00a0 it, for the losses or damages that the said manager may cause in the discharge of his office.<br\/><br\/>It should be borne in mind that the vessel herself is liable as a mortgaged thing for the credits of the shippers or owners of the goods transported by her; and that the naviero (agent), even though he is riot the owner of the vessel, is in every way liable to the creditor for such losses and damages, without prejudice to his rights against the owner on the value of the same, its equipment and freight.<br\/><br\/>Case No. 2485 being remanded to the Court of First Instance with\u00a0 the decision of this court affirming the judgment appealed from, it is the duty of the judge below who is charged with the enforcement of the final, decision to resolve all matters that may hinder or obstruct the complete execution thereof; among such impediments, the allegation of the right or means prescribed in the second part of the aforesaid article 587 of the Commercial Code. Otherwise no legal provision whatever has\u00a0 been alleged that may exempt him from fully complying with the said judgment in all its parts.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, and considering that\u00a0 the orders excepted to, of the court below dated the 16th and 24th of December, 1907, are in accordance with the law, it is our opinion that the same should be and are hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellants; it being of course understood that the writ of preliminary injunction issued on the 3d of the said month shall be at once dissolved and set aside.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Carson, Willard,<\/i> and<i> Tracey, JJ., <\/i>concur.<i><br\/>Arellano, C.

(VII., Jur. Fil. 100).<br\/><br\/>Entre las pruebas anteriormente recibidas una era el Exhibit \"A\" consistente en un acta de deslinde de la expresada Hacienda de San Juan del Monte levantada en 7 de Octubre de 1891 por el Municipio del pueblo de San Juan del Monte, al que acomana como exposicion grafica de dicho deslande el plano Exhibit \"B\".<br\/><br\/>Hubiera podido servir, con arreglo a una circular de la Direccion General de Administracion Civil de 15 de Julio de 1881, para solicitar la composicion con el Estado de la propiedad de que se trata.<br\/><br\/>La solicitante justifico adamas su posesion con los recibos de los diezmos prediales que habia venido pagando como impuesto al Gobierno desde 1865 hasta 1889. Y el representante del Gobierno en su anterior alegato habia dicho: - \"Los recibos de diezmos prediales prueban que la Corporacion de Padres Dominicos en estas Islas poseia la Hacienda de San Juan del Monte, mas no que esta tenga tales linderos y extension.\"<br\/><br\/>En la anterior decision dijo este Tribunal: - \"A nuestro juicio, esta pretension (la del representatnte del Gobierno) esta bien fundada. No se trato de probar por ningun otro medio que por la exhibicion del documento suscrito por el Gobernadorcillo del pueblo de San Juan del Monte en 1891 que el terrano descrito en los documnetos otorgados con anterioridad al ano 1671 era el mismo descrito en la peticion.... Ninguno de los que suscribieron este documento, ni el agrimensor, ni ningun otro fue llamado como testigo al objeto de corroborar su contendio. No se presento prueba testifical de que el terreno cuyos linderos y colindancias se consignan en la solicitud era el mismo terrano danominado Hacienda de San Juan del Monte.<br\/><br\/>Ahora se han presentado cinco testigos para certificarlo, y a sus delarciones nada se ha objetado. Asi es que el Tribunal sentenciador ha formulado sus conclusiones en estos terminos:<br\/><blockquote>\"De las declaraciones de los testigos presentados por la parte solictante, se desprende que la Orden de Padres Dominicos ha estado en posesion quieta, pacifica y continuada del terrano descrito en la solicitud por un periodo de tiempo mayor que el exigido por el art. 54 No. VI de la Ley No. 926.\"<br\/><br\/>\"Se ha convenido entre las entidades solicitante y opositora, que la parcela de terrano senalada en el plano por medio de las letras, A, B, C y D es la que fue ocupada por el polvorin perteneciente al ramo de Guerra, circunstancia por la que se considero como zona militar.\"<\/blockquote>Y fallo decretando \"la adjudicacion y registro del terrano descrito en la solicitud, con exclusion del edificio levantado en el mismo, conocido bajo el nombre de Polvorin de San Juan del Monte, a favor de la entidad solicitante, sujeta la extension considerada como zona militar, a la servidumbre legal de zona polemica.\"<br\/><br\/>Contra esta decision se han alegado los siguientes errores:<br\/><br\/>1. \"Es contraria - dice el apelante - al resultado de las pruebas, la conclusion que sienta la decision de que la parcela de terreno zona polemica de que se trata es parte integrante de la Hacienda de San Juan del Monte e incluida en los documentos publicos presentados por la parte solicitante en justificacion del dominio alegado sobre la hacienda en su totalidad<br\/><br\/>2. \"La solicitante no ha adquirido derecho alguno sobre la llamada zona polemica en virtud de la Ley No. 926.\"<br\/><br\/>No se ha padecido el 1, porque la prueba testifical ha venido a completar la documental que justificaba el dominio, y bien apreciada en la conclusion de la sentencia resultaba probada que todo cuanto esta comprendido en los linderos de la Hacienda de San Juan del Monte pertenece en propiedad a la solicitante.<br\/><br\/>Y tampoco el 2, porque el titulo de zaona polemica, unico hasta ahora alegado por el opositor para oponerse al dominio de la solicitante, lo presupone mas bien toda vez que siendo no mas que derecho de servidumbre la zona polemica y la ocupacion militar, tiene que haber un dueno de predio sirviente; de otro modo, no habia necesidad de proclamar la servidumbre, bastandole al Estado ser dueno para establecer toda prohibicion de modo absoluto, no en la forma relativa de servidumbre.<br\/><br\/>Pro los fundamentos expuestos, confirmamos la sentencia apelada sin especial pronunciamiento de costas en esta instancia.

The Chinaman being short of money at the time was only able to give him P50, of which P45 were his own and the other P5 he borrowed from Agustina Roxas; the accused then warned him that if he did not complete the payment of the P100 which he needed on the following Monday, the Chinaman would lose the four stalls\u00a0 above referred to; and this actually\u00a0 happened, for when the Chinaman went to the market on the morning of the said Monday he found that the four stalls were\u00a0 already occupied by other persons, and, upon complaining about it,\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 answered that because he had refused\u00a0 to pay\u00a0 the P100, his stalls were\u00a0 allotted to others.\u00a0 It should be noted that the daily rent for each stall was P15\u00a0 centavos, or P1.05\u00a0 a week, under the regulations or municipal ordinances.<br\/><br\/>The corresponding complaint was presented by the prosecuting\u00a0 attorney\u00a0 charging Ceferino Cauas with having willfully collected an unlawful reward in violation of the Internal Revenue Law.\u00a0 Proceedings were instituted and the judge entered judgment on the 4th of June,\u00a0 1907, sentencing the accused to the penalty of six months' imprisonment with hard labor, and\u00a0 to\u00a0 pay a\u00a0 fine of\u00a0 400 and costs.\u00a0 From this judgment the attorney of the accused has appealed.<br\/><br\/>From the facts above stated, which have been fully proven in this case, it appears that a crime has\u00a0 been committed in violation\u00a0 of the provisions of\u00a0 section 24 of\u00a0 the Internal Revenue Law, Act No. 1189 of the Philippine Commission, which, as applied to the present case, is of the following tenor;<br\/><blockquote>\"Every officer, employee, or agent appointed and acting under the authority of this act.\u2014<br\/><br\/>\"First.\u00a0 Who is guilty of any extortion\u00a0 or willful\u00a0 oppression under color of law; or<br\/><br\/>\"Second.\u00a0 Who knowingly demands other or greater sums than are authorized by law, or receives any fees, compensation, or reward except as by law prescribed for the performance of any duty; or<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"Tenth.

In\u00a0 consequence\u00a0 of said wounds the assaulted man,, who turned out to be Julian Lavandero, died instantly.<br\/><br\/>A complaint having been filed charging Daniel Campo with the crime of homicide, and the corresponding proceedings having been instituted,\u00a0 the court, on the 31st of July, 1900, sentenced the accused to the penalty of fourteen years\u00a0 eight months\u00a0 and one day of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i>, to suffer the accessory penalties, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of 1,000, and to pay the costs.\u00a0 From said judgment the accused appealed.<br\/><br\/>The facts stated above, fully proven in this case, constitute the crime of homicide defined and punished under article 404 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as in the violent death of Julian Lavandero, a resident of Talisay, Island of Cebu, caused by the use of firearms, none of the qualifying circumstances of article\u00a0 403 of said\u00a0 code,\u00a0 determining a graver crime and penalty, are present.<br\/><br\/>The accused,\u00a0 Daniel Campo, pleaded not guilty, but as to his exculpatory allegations, that when trying to arrest the deceased\u00a0 the\u00a0 latter offered resistance and attacked him with a\u00a0 sickle, and that for said reason he was obliged to fire at him, the record contains full evidence that there was no such resistance or aggression on the part of the victim; that the sickle belonged to Venancio Panila, who was not one of the gamblers and was at that time working in a cocoanut tree; that the accused, notwithstanding the orders given by the corporal of police, Pedro Nadela, to stop firing at the\u00a0 gamblers who were running away, continued to do so without reason therefor and without any resistance having\u00a0 been offered by the parties fleeing, and particularly on the part of\u00a0 Julian Lavandero; that\u00a0 the accused used up all the cartridges with which\u00a0 his revolver was loaded; that notwithstanding the fact that the deceased had been wounded in the right arm and in consequence had fallen to the ground, said accused still fired at him at point-blank range,\u00a0 as testified\u00a0 to by eyewitnesses. Such\u00a0 conduct shows that without any\u00a0 reason whatever he intended to\u00a0 kill Julian Lavandero, who was running away unarmed and had offered\u00a0 no resistance at all, and\u00a0 that the aggressor disobeyed the orders of\u00a0 the corporal to\u00a0 stop firing at the person ho was\u00a0 in pursuit of;\u00a0 therefore, his action can not be\u00a0 classified as mere negligence, but as a real crime of homicide\u00a0 willfully and feloniously committed.\u00a0\u00a0 The accused could not\u00a0 allege that he acted in the compliance of a duty or in the lawful exercise of a right, because in the case in question he was not authorized\u00a0 to shoot in order to capture an individual who was fleeing and who offered no resistance; whatever.\u00a0 The supremo court of Spain, in\u00a0 its decision\u00a0 of the 6th of\u00a0 October, 1887,\u00a0 has\u00a0 among other things held, that \"the exorcise of public authority does not warrant the use of force except in the extreme case of where one is attacked and finds no other means to comply with his\u00a0 duty and\u00a0 cause himself to be respected and obeyed.\"\u00a0 The unfortunate Julian Lavandero was running at but a\u00a0 short distance\u00a0 from his pursuer, lie was unarmed,\u00a0 and had offered no resistance; the accused, however, without the least justification\u00a0 fired several shots at him, wounding him in the right arm, and after he had fallen to the ground fired still another\u00a0 shot in his back at such close range\u00a0 that the\u00a0 clothes\u00a0 of the deceased were found to be burnt; in consequence\u00a0 the latter died instantly.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime herein no mitigating or aggravating\u00a0 circumstance\u00a0 is present; therefore the adequate penalty should be applied in its medium\u00a0 degree.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth, and the judgment appealed from being in accordance\u00a0 with the law, it is our opinion that the same should be affirmed with the costs against the accused, provided, however, that he shall be further sentenced to suffer the accessory penalties imposed by article 59 of the code.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The procedure for the purpose of this Act and the legal effects thereof shall thereupon be in all respects as provided in\u00a0 sections three,\u00a0 four, five, and six\u00a0 of said Act Numbered Six hundred and twenty-seven.\"<\/blockquote>Section 6 of Act No. 627, referred to in Act No. 648, is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The provisions of sections thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, and forty-two of Act Numbered One hundred and ninety, entitled 'An Act providing a Code\u00a0 of Procedure in Civil\u00a0 Actions and\u00a0 Special\u00a0 Proceedings\u00a0 in the Philippine Islands are hereby made applicable to all lands, not more than sixteen hectares in extent, within the limits of any military reservation, notwithstanding such lands would be public lands were it not for titles acquired in the manner stated in said sections thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, and forty-two.\"<\/blockquote>Act No. 627 was approved on February 9,1903, and Act No. 648 was approved on March 3, 1903.\u00a0 Sections 38 to 42, inclusive, of the Code of Civil Procedure, which are referred to in section 6 of Act No. 627, contain the statute mi limitations, and section 41 fixes the period of prescription, relating to real estate, at ten years.<br\/><br\/>It was proven that the petitioner had been in possession of the land in question for more than ten years.\u00a0 If, therefore, the\u00a0 prescriptive\u00a0 period brought into Act No. 648 from Act No. 627 is or\u00a0 could be made applicable to mineral lands, the judgment of the court below should be affirmed. If, on the contrary, it\u00a0 can not be made applicable because inconsistent with the provisions of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, relating to mineral lands, then the judgment must be reversed.<br\/><br\/>This Act No. 648 and its relation to the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, we had occasion\u00a0 to\u00a0 consider in the case of Jones <i>vs.<\/i> The Insular Government (6 Phil. Rep., 122).\u00a0 It was there sought to apply the prescriptive period contained in\u00a0 Acts No. 648 and No. 627 to agricultural lands within the limits of the civil reservation\u00a0 at Baguio, in the Province of Benguet.\u00a0 The claim of the Government in that case was that Act No. 648 was invalid because it never had been submitted to Congress, as required by the provisions of section 13 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902.\u00a0 It was held\u00a0 that this contention could not be sustained, and that\u00a0 Act No.\u00a0 648 was not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act of Congress; was not invalid so far as agricultural lands were concerned; and the judgment in favor of the\u00a0 petitioner, founded upon the prescriptive period mentioned in that Act and Act No. 627, was sustained.\u00a0 Speaking of section 13 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, this court said in that case, at page 128:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is first to be noted that section 13 does not apply to all lands. Timber and mineral, lands are expressly excluded.\u00a0\u00a0 If the Commission should pass laws relating to mineral lands\u00a0 without submitting them to Congress, as it has done (Act No. 624), their validity would not be determined by inquiring if they had been submitted to Congress under section 13, but rather by inquiring if they were inconsistent with other provisions of the act relating to mineral\u00a0 lands.\u00a0 In other words, the fact that\u00a0 such laws were not submitted to Congress would not necessarily make them void.<br\/><br\/>\"The same is true of legislation relating\u00a0 to coal lands, as to which sections 53 and 57 contain provisions. *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>At page 130 the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It seems very clear that rules and regulations concerning mineral, timber, and coal lands, and lands bought from religious orders need not be submitted to Congress. If they are not inconsistent with the\u00a0 provisions of the Act of Congress relating to the same subjects, they are valid.\"<\/blockquote>The contention of the Attorney-General is that this Act No. 648, in so far as it attempts to make applicable to mineral lands the prescriptive period of ten years, is inconsistent with other provisions of the Act of Congress relating to the same subject, and is therefore invalid.<br\/><br\/>Section 20 of the Act of Congress is as follows: <br\/><blockquote>\"That in all cases public lands in the Philippine Islands valuable for minerals shall be reserved from sale, except as otherwise expressly directed by law.\"<\/blockquote>Sections 21 to 52, inclusive, provide in detail the manner in which title may be acquired to certain public mineral lands.<br\/><br\/>Section 53, as amended by section 9 of the Act of Congress of February 6, 1005, and sections 54, 55, and 61 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 53. That every person above the age of twentyone years who is a citizen of the United States or of the Philippine Islands, or who has acquired the right of a native of said Islands under and by virtue of\u00a0 the treaty of Paris, or any association of persons severally qualified as above, shall, upon application to the proper provincial treasurer, have the right to enter any quality of vacant coal lands of said Islands, not otherwise appropriated or reserved by competent authority, not exceeding sixty-four hectares to such individual person, or one hundred and twenty-eight, hectares to such association upon payment to the provincial treasurer or the collector of internal revenue, as the case may be, of not less than fifty pesos per hectare for such lands, where the same shall be situated\u00a0 more than twenty-five kilometers from any completed railroad or available harbor or navigable stream, and not less than one hundred pesos per hectare for such lands as shall be within twenty-five kilometers of such road, harbor, or stream: <i>Provided,<\/i> That such entries shall be taken in squares of sixteen or sixty-four hectares, in conformity with the rules and regulations governing the public-land\u00a0 surveys\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said Islands in plotting legal subdivisions.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 54. That any person or association of persons, severally qualified as above provided, who have opened and improved, or shall hereafter open and improve, any coal mine or mines upon the public lands, and shall be in actual possession of the same, shall be entitled to a preference right of entry under the preceding section of the mines so opened and improved.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 55. That all claims under the preceding section must be presented to the proper provincial secretary within sixty days after the date of actual possession and the commencement of improvements on the land by the filing of a declaratory statement therefor; and where the improvements shall have been made prior to\u00a0 the expiration of three months from the date of the passage of this Act, sixty, days from the expiration of such three months shall be allowed for the filing of a declaratory statement; and no sale under the provisions of this Act shall be allmved until the expiration of six months from the date of the passage of this Act.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 61. That mining rights on public lands in the Philippine Islands shall, after the passage of this\u00a0 Act, be acquired only in accordance with its provisions.\"<\/blockquote>It is thus seen that Congress has itself provided a way in which title to public mineral lands can be obtained. It has not left that matter to the Commission.\u00a0 The only power given to the Commission in connection with mineral lands is the power to make needful regulations (sec. 57) for carrying into effect the provisions of the Act of Congress.<br\/><br\/>The petitioner does\u00a0 not claim to have acquired any interest in these lands by virtue of the provisions of section 53, and the following sections of the Act of Congress, or\u00a0 by virtue of any other provisions of that\u00a0 Act. He does not claim to have acquired any rights to the land, or to the coal therein, by virtue of any mining concessions made by the Spanish Government.\u00a0 He presented ; no evidence to show that the land considered as agricultural land had ever been conveyed to him either by the Spanish Government or the American Government.\u00a0 In fact, the\u00a0 only evidence that he presented was evidence that he had occupied and cultivated the land as agricultural land for the period of more than ten years.<br\/><br\/>The evidence in the ease clearly shows, therefore, that this, land in question is public land and not private land, and being public land it falls within the provisions of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902.<br\/><br\/>While the petitioner does not claim to\u00a0 have acquired title to this public land by virtue of the provisions of the; Act of Congress, he does claim that he has become the owner thereof by virtue of the provisions of Act Ho. 648, in connection with Act No. 627.\u00a0 In other words, he claims that he has acquired title to public mineral land in some other way than that pointed out by the Act of Congress. This claim is directly opposed to the provisions of section 61, above quoted which declares that mining rights in public lands shall not be acquired except as provided in that law.\u00a0 To apply the prescriptive period of ten years mentioned in Act No. 627 would be to allow the petitioner to become the owner of this land by virtue of the Act of the Commission and not by virtue of the Act of Congress. It is to be noted, moreover) that the Act of Congress itself contains a section relating to prescription. Section 45 of that Act is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 45. That where such person or association, they and their grantors have held and worked their claims for a period equal to the time prescribed by the statute of limitations of the Philippine Islands, evidence of such possession and working of the claims for such period shall be sufficient to establish a right to a patent thereto under this Act, in the absence of any adverse claim; but nothing in this Act shall be deemed to impair any lien which may have, attached in any way whatever prior to the issuance of a patent.\"<\/blockquote>It will be seen that merely occupying public mineral lands for agricultural purposes is not sufficient to bring a case within the provisions of this section 45.The land must have been, held and worked as mineral land before the; person\u00a0 so holding it can claim the benefits of this article.\u00a0 (Fianza <i>vs.<\/i> Reavis, 7 Phil. Rep., 610;)<br\/><br\/>These two Acts of the Commission, above referred to, were, passed after the Act of Congress.\u00a0 It is probable that it was not the intention of the Commission to make them applicable to public mining lands, but if it were the intention to make them so applicable, and if they must be considered as applying to all public lands, then they are clearly void, so far as they\u00a0 relate to mineral lands, because they are inconsistent with the Act of Congress above mentioned,<br\/><br\/>We have considered the lands in question, in this case as coal lands.\u00a0 They were so treated by the court below. The\u00a0 Attorney-General states in his brief that it was admitted in that court that they were\u00a0 coal lands and\u00a0 no brief has been filed by the appellee impugning that statement<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court for such further proceedings therein as are contemplated by section 5 of Act No. 627.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in, this court.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Delivery was made at the special request of Sr. Robles and completed only after it had. been suspended for a time awaiting payment by him of the price.\u00a0 He did not, in fact, pay, but promised to pay within a month.\u00a0 On the 9th of December, and after the delivery, he executed before a\u00a0 notary public a formal\u00a0 protest, claiming 22,000 pesos damages for the failure of his harvest\u00a0 owing to the delay of the wheel, which\u00a0 was necessary to run his sugar mill.\u00a0 It also appeared that an additional delay of three weeks after delivery was caused by certain changes in the shafting which Sr. Bobles found it necessary to make because the axle was not long enough for the frame which had been prepared for it.<br\/><br\/>Before accepting the wheel and shafting, Sr. Robles had them examined by an expert machinist, Mr. Cleland, who certified that they corresponded in all their parts with the cut in the catalogue on which the order had been given.<br\/><br\/>The judge found that the last delay of three weeks was due, not to any defect in the axle, but to the unsuitability of the framework prepared for it; furthermore, that the dismantling of the wheel which had previously been in use, in anticipation of the arrival of the new, had directly caused much of the delay and the consequent loss of the harvest.\u00a0 He also found that, although it is shown that a great quantity of sugar was damaged for lack of a mill, yet there is no proof of either the quantity of sugar or its value sufficient as a foundation for any damages that might be awarded on defendant's claim.<br\/><br\/>His conclusions were that the acceptance of the wheel and shafting, and a concurrent promise to pay therefor, were a waiver of any claim for damages growing out of the delay in delivery; that, the injury suffered was the result, in large part, of the improvident dismantling of the old wheel; that any damages shown were too remote for recovery thereof under article 1107 of the [Civil] Code, and that for the nonarrival of the steamer on which the machinery was shipped the plaintiffs were not responsible.<br\/><br\/>It also appears that, instead of paying for the machinery, as agreed, Sr. Bobles brought suit against the plaintiffs for P22,000 damages,\u00a0 whereupon the plaintiffs, in their turn, interposed a claim <i>de menor cuantia<\/i>, for the purchase price.\u00a0 The principal action was never finished, but in the course of incidental proceedings costs on appeal were\u00a0 awarded the plaintiffs, which have been taxed as amounting to P548.99 and have been included in the judgment herein.<br\/><br\/>While\u00a0 that action was pending Zacarias Robles died and the claim of\u00a0 the plaintiffs for P1,000 as the price of the wheel and shafting, and for the aforesaid costs, was presented to the commissioners of claims against his\u00a0 estate, under the provisions of the present Code of Civil Procedure,\u00a0 whereupon the administratrix interposed\u00a0 her counterclaim for P22,160,\u00a0 damages to sugar, and P292.92 expenses in refitting shafting and axle.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge disallowed the counterclaim and awarded to the plaintiffs the judgment prayed for, in which\u00a0 we find that he was fully justified\u00a0 by the facts recited.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the Court of First instance is affirmed, with costs of this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The undisputed facts in the case seem to be as follows:<br\/><br\/>On the 13th day of May, 1887, the plaintiff was indebted to one Petronila Espino in the sum of P2,705. On that day the plaintiff executed and delivered to the defendant two contracts (Exhibits A and B), one denominated a special mortgage (Exhibit A) upon certain parcels of land mentioned in paragraph 4 of the complaint filed in this case, numbered 4, 5, 6, and 7 as subparagraphs of said paragraph 4, for the purpose of guaranteeing the payment of the sum of P745, with interest at 25 per cent.<br\/><br\/>On the same day the plaintiff executed and delivered to the defendant another contract, denominated<i> una venta con pacto de retro de terrenos y bienes<\/i> (a sale with right of repurchase of lands and property), upon certain property mentioned in said paragraph 4 of the complaint filed in said cause, numbered 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 in said paragraph 4, for the purpose of securing the payment of the sum of P1,960.<br\/><br\/>On the 20th day of July, 1894, the plaintiff and defendant had a settlement of their accounts and it was then found that the plaintiff was still indebted to the defendant in the sum of P2,000.<br\/><br\/>On this latter date the plaintiff executed and delivered to the defendant another contract (Exhibit 1) by the terms of which the plaintiff recognized his indebtedness to the defendant in the said sum of P2,000 therein, and promised to pay said indebtedness in four years as follows : P500 to be applied on the principal, and P200 interest in the month of June of each of the years 1895, 1896, 1897 and 1898.\u00a0 Said contract contained the further provision:<br\/><blockquote>\"2. In case that the four above-mentioned periods expire without his indebtedness of two thousand pesos to Petronila Espino having been paid by said Pasaporte, the sum hereinbefore paid by said Pasaporte on account of his debt shall not be applied in payment thereof but only as an amount delivered to the creditor as damages for not having complied with the promises above stated, and the mortgage existing upon the properties mentioned in the two instruments shall be executed in accordance with the stipulations therein made, and he will return, without any objection, all that has been enumerated with the single exception of one mill, it having been already sold and the price delivered to and acknowledged by said Petronila; he, the said Pasaporte, also promised that he would not participate in the improvements made by him on the land and on the mill, should he fail to comply with his promise above stated.\"<\/blockquote>On the 15th day of August, 1898, the indebtedness not having been fully paid' in accordance with the terms of\u00a0 said contract of the 20th of July, 1894, the plaintiff executed and delivered the following contract, by which he delivered to the defendant Espino all of the property except a part of the personal property which was mentioned in paragraph 2 of said contract (the 15th of August, 1898):<br\/><blockquote>\"We, Don Juan Pasaporte, a native and resident of the town of Pototan, and Do\u00f1a Petronila Espino, a native of the town of Due\u00f1as and resident of this town, have made and executed this agreement, in duplicate, by virtue of the conditions stipulated in the private document executed in the town of Janiuay on the 20th day of July, of the year eighteen hundred and ninety-four, and of those two instruments executed in this town on the 13th day of May, of the year eighteen hundred and eighty-seven, under the following conditions:<br\/><br\/>\"1. The said Pasaporte, from the date of this instrument, conveys and delivers to the said Espino the following- described properties:<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>a<\/i>) A parcel of land situated in Guibuanngan del Bangac toward the River Suagne, jurisdiction of this pueblo, of an area of about 3 gantas corn seed, provincial measure; bounded on the north by the lands of Pantaleon Patanao and Gregorio Perdosa; on the south by the lands of Bias Borras, Juan Pasaporte, and Francisco Labrador; on the east by that of Nisario Patani; and on the west by that of the said Perdosa.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>) A parcel of land of an area of two and a half <i>gantas<\/i> of corn by the same measure, situated in Guimacas, jurisdiction of the pueblo of Pototan, bounded on the north by the River Suagne; on the south and the east by lands of Anastasio Pillo; and on the west by those of Agustin Pe\u00f1alven.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>c<\/i>) A parcel of land of an area of about six <i>gantas<\/i> corn seed by the same measure, situated in Bangac, jurisdiction of this pueblo, also bounded on the north by lands of Antonio Cordero; on the south by the River Suagne; on the east by lands of Gregorio Perdosa and Joaquin Magos; and on the west by those of Juan Magbanua.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>d<\/i>) A parcel of land of an area of two <i>gantas<\/i> of corn by the same measure, in the sitio of Bangac toward the River Suagne, jurisdiction of this pueblo, bounded on the north by lands of Gregoria Paugaritijon; on the south by those of Rufo Fernandez; on the east by those of Benita Prieto; and on the west by those of Nisario Patani.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>e<\/i>) A parcel of land in the same sitio, of an area of one and a half <i>gantas<\/i> of corn, by the same measure, bounded on the north by lands of Francisco Pudadera'; on, the south by those of Patricio Jabalde; on the east by the River Suagne; and on the west by lands of Benita,Prieto.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>f<\/i>) A parcel of land of an area of two <i>canaves<\/i> of seed of paddy, provincial measure, toward the western part of this town, bounded by lands of Gregorio Pradas and Vicente Pelaez; on the south by those of Petronila Espino and of the deceased Marciano Gabalde; and on the west by those of Felipe Magos.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>g<\/i>) A parcel of land of an area of two <i>cavanes<\/i> of paddy, by provincial measure, situated at the head of the small River Salngan, jurisdiction of this pueblo, bounded on the north by lands of Camilo Quiamba; on the south by those of Patricio Gabalde, Raymundo Raquitizo, and Fernando Poblacion; on the east by those of Antonio Pelaez and the deceased Zerrudo; and on the west by those of Juana Periche.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>h<\/i>) A parcel of land occupied by an iron mill of third class, of an area of two <i>gantas<\/i> of paddy, bounded on the north, south and west by the roads; on the east by the land of the same Pasaporte.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>i<\/i>) Ten carabaos of second-class, two bulls, two <i>camarines<\/i> and four <i>cauas<\/i> with their <i>tiajoys<\/i> and further accessories required for the mill.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The ten carabaos, one bull, and three carts will be delivered by the said Pasaporte as soon as the animals have recovered from their sickness and the carts are repaired.\"<\/blockquote>Sometime after the execution and delivery of the above contract, Petronila Espino died and Domingo Marin was duly appointed as administrator of the estate.<br\/><br\/>On the 8th of July, 1905, the plaintiff commenced an action in the Court of First Instance of the city of Iloilo against the said administrator, for the purpose of recovering the property mentioned in the contract of the 15th of August, 1898, offering at the same time to pay the sum of P2,000, the amount of the indebtedness which existed in favor of the defendant Petronila Espino. On the 6th of December, 1905, the defendant answered the complaint of the plaintiff and alleged that, by the terms of the contract of the 15th of August, 1898, all of the property mentioned in paragraph 4 of the complaint, described in the two contracts of May 13 (Exhibits A and B) was delivered to the defendant, except the property mentioned in paragraph 2 of said contract (August 15, 1898), for the purpose of paying in full the indebtedness existing between the plaintiff and defendant, and that, by such delivery, the defendant became the absolute owner of such property. The defendant further set up the counterclaim against the plaintiff, attempting to recover the value of the property which the plaintiff had failed to deliver and which he had promised to deliver, in accordance with paragraph 2 of the said contract of August 15, 1898.<br\/><br\/>The cause was duly submitted to the lower court, and, after a full consideration of the facts submitted during the trial, the court rendered a judgment against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendant for the sum of 95 and costs.<br\/><br\/>The lower court held that the delivery of the property mentioned in said contract of August 15, 1898, was in payment of the indebtedness existing between the parties, and it was intended and understood by the parties then that such property should become absolutely the property of Petronila Espino, and that said indebtedness should be all extinguished when the balance of the property mentioned in paragraph 2 of said contract should also be delivered.<br\/><br\/>The lower court also found that five of the carabaos mentioned in said paragraph 2 had been delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant in the year 1898, and that the other five had died without any fault on the part of the plaintiff. The court further found that the plaintiff had not delivered to the defendant, in accordance with the terms of the contract, <i>los carros y el vacuno <\/i>(the carts and the bull) mentioned in said paragraph 2 and that the value of the same was P95. From the judgment of the lower court the plaintiff appealed and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><br\/>First. The court erred in admitting as proof Exhibits A and B, [of the appellee] after having admitted as proof, without opposition, Exhibits 1 and 2 [of the appellant].<br\/><br\/>Second. The court committed an error in holding that, by Exhibit 2 (contract of August 15, 1898), the plaintiff delivered the property mentioned therein in payment of his debt.<br\/><br\/>Third. The court committed an error in condemning the plaintiff to pay the sum of P95, the value <i>de los carros y un vacuno<\/i> (of the carts and one bull).<br\/><br\/>Fourth. The court committed an error in not declaring null the two contracts Exhibits A and B.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the first assignment of error, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the lower court committed no error in allowing them to be admitted as proof, for the reason that they were introduced in evidence for the purpose of proving an express allegation made by the defendant in his answer.\u00a0 The defendant also makes reference to said contracts in the second paragraph of his complaint.\u00a0 The defendant having the right to allege the fact as a defense, had the right to prove it by any material and relevant evidence.\u00a0 These contracts being the best proof, they were admissible as evidence, and the court committed no error in admitting them, even though Exhibits 1 and 2 had been admitted before that time.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the second assignment of error, the parties themselves, in the prelude to the said contract, said that the same was made \"by virtue of the conditions in the private document made by us *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * on the twentieth day of July, 1894, and of the two deeds made by us\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * on the thirteenth of May, 1887.\"<br\/><br\/>By reference to paragraph 2 of the contract of July 20, 1894, it will be seen that the defendant, in case of a default of payment of the indebtedness mentioned therein, had a right to take possession of the property mentioned in this contract in payment of said indebtedness, which right was expressed in the following terms: \"The mortgage existing upon the properties mentioned in the two instruments shall be executed in accordance with the stipulations therein made, and he will return, without any objection, all that has been enumerated.\"<br\/><br\/>By reference to Exhibits A and B, the first a special mortgage and the second a <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, it will be seen. that the defendant had a special claim upon the property in question.\u00a0 This claim was expressly recognized in the contract of July 20, 1894, and the plaintiff there expressly relinquished his right to said property in case the indebtedness was not paid, in accordance with the terms of that contract and in case the said property should be delivered to the defendant.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion, therefore, and so hold, that, when Exhibits A and B, and 1 and 2 were considered together, it was the intention of the plaintiff, at the time he delivered the property to the defendant, under the terms of the contract of August 15, 1898, that said property should be in absolute payment of his indebtedness and that the defendant should become the owner of the same.<br\/><br\/>Holding as we do that, by virtue of the contracts mentioned above, the defendant became the owner of said property, the plaintiff, under his promise to deliver the same to the defendant, became liable for his failure so to do. No objection has been made concerning the value which the lower court fixed upon said property. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the lower court made no error in rendering judgment against the plaintiff for the sum of P95.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the fourth assignment of error, it will be seen by a careful reading of the decision of the lower court, that the said court did not pass upon the question whether or not said contracts A and B had been annulled. This question was in no form presented to the court and there is nothing in the record which in any way tends to show that the defendant had waived his right to the possession of the property under and by the terms of said contracts A and B. The subsequent contracts of July 20, 1894, and August 15, 1898, were in recognition of the rights of the defendant created in the contracts A and B.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that the lower court committed no error in his conclusions and, therefore, the judgment and order of the lower court are hereby affirmed, with costs.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

SALVADOR VALLEJO ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS. <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRACEY, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the 17th of May, 1907, in consequence of a complaint of a public disturbance lodged by Januario Duran with the police authorities of Polangui, in the Province of Albay, the officer in charge at the city hall sent two municipal policemen, named Tranquilino Saravillo and Dalmacio Sabio to the place of the disturbance, which was the house of Salvador Vallejo, and the narrative of the policeman Sabio as to what occurred there is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The guard said to us, 'Go to San Diego and get the people who are making a scandal there.'\u00a0 I immediately went, following Tranquilino, to the house of Salvador Vallejo.\u00a0 While we were still on the ground we heard the shouts of Vallejo.\u00a0 He was running from one side to the other of his house.\u00a0 When I approached the house of Vallejo I heard the words, in a loud voice,<i> Matza,\u00a0 turco, tesorero municipal\u00a0 secretario de<\/i> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">*\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<\/span> (using obscenity which it is unnecessary to quote).\u00a0 We were about 5 rods distant.\u00a0 When he spoke those words he was upstairs in his house at the window,\u00a0\u00a0 Tranquilino and\u00a0 I and a great many other people were near the house.\u00a0 We were in front of the house, looking and listening.\u00a0 There are other houses there, but none immediately opposite. We immediately went up the steps to arrest the accused Vallejo.\u00a0 On arriving\u00a0 at the top of the stairs I knocked on the door.\u00a0 We heard Vallejo ask, 'Who is it?,' and\u00a0 I said, 'Municipal police.' Thereupon Vallejo immediately came to the door to meet us, and as he approached us he said '*\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"\u00a0 (another\u00a0 obscene\u00a0 expression), <i> policias municipales.<\/i>'\u00a0 He stopped\u00a0 inside the doorway, and\u00a0 asked us, 'Have you any\u00a0 warrant to come in?' I replied that we had none, and then he immediately struck Tranquilino Saravillo with his list, and immediately afterwards he struck me also.\u00a0 When I felt him strike me here in the cheek, I dodged\u00a0 and struck him\u00a0 with\u00a0 my club.\u00a0 When he attempted to strike me again with his fist, I caught his right hand.\u00a0 I said to Salvador Vallejo, 'You are arrested.' We arrested him because he did not come with us but resisted.\u00a0 Then Bias Ausina came out and threw his arms around Vallejo's body and dragged him away from us, and immediately drew him inside and closed the door,\"<\/blockquote>Tranquilino Saravillo gives\u00a0 substantially the same account.\u00a0 Both policemen were at the time in uniform.<br\/><br\/>These facts are not seriously contested, and upon them the judge of First Instance found both defendants guilty of an\u00a0 attempt against an agent of authority, and giving Vallejo the benefit of drunkenness as an extenuating circumstance, sentenced him to Bilibid for\u00a0 three years and six months, with P100 fine, and sentenced Bias Ausina to four years two months and one day, together with a like fine.\u00a0 The prosecution was under the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>The defense rests upon points of law:\u00a0 First. That within his own house a man's person in sacred and\u00a0 he may conduct himself as he pleases.\u00a0 The inviolability of a dwelling has been well\u00a0 explained in United States <i>vs.<\/i> Arceo (3 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 381), but while it\u00a0 may be\u00a0 true in general that \"a man's house is his\u00a0 castle,\" it is equally true that he may\u00a0 not use that castle as a citadel for aggression against his neighbors, nor can he within its walls create such disorder as to affect their peace.\u00a0 It is clear from the testimony that in this case the behavior of the defendant amounted to more than private misconduct and constituted a public annoyance and a breach of the peace of the neighborhood.<br\/><br\/>Second. It is further urged that even for a breach of the peace the policemen had no right to arrest without a warrant and that in doing so they acted without authority, so that resistance to them was lawful.\u00a0 Municipal police in the Philippines hold office under the statutes of the Commission, by which their powers are supposed to be defined, and which may be construed in the light of American law.\u00a0 It is axiomatic\u00a0 in\u00a0 the law of\u00a0 England and America that a peace officer may arrest without warrant for a breach of the peace committed in his presence, but it is contended that municipal policemen outside of Manila have not conferred upon them by statute any such powers. The extent to which police officers may go in the city of Manila is considered in the case of the United States vs Alexander (8 Phil. Rep., 29), in which the policeman was held empowered to arrest without warrant for breach of municipal ordinances\u00a0 committed in his presence.\u00a0 And their powers in other municipalities may be implied from our decision in United States <i>vs.<\/i> Burgueta (10 Phil. Rep., 188).<br\/><br\/>The law for municipalities in general gives the municipal council power to establish, regulate, and maintain a police department to promote the prosperity, improve the morals, peace, good order, comfort, and convenience of the township and inhabitants thereof, and to enforce obedience\u00a0 thereto\u00a0 with such lawful fines and penalties as the council may prescribe.\u00a0 (Act No. 82, sec. 39, subdivision <i>t, dd,<\/i> and <i>jj<\/i>.)<br\/><br\/>There\u00a0 is nowhere any express definition of the word \"policeman,\" nor any\u00a0 specification of his powers, which therefore, are left to be inferred from the common law or to be taken from the express provisions of local ordinances.\u00a0 In the municipality of Polangui, ordinances had been passed prohibiting disturbances of public\u00a0 order, drunkenness, and indecent behavior \"in a public place or in a place which is in view of the public,\" but the papers before us disclose no ordinance or regulation directing the police when to act, or empowering a policeman in any instance to arrest without a warrant.\u00a0 Thus, in the absence of\u00a0 any legislation by the\u00a0 Commission or by the municipal council,\u00a0 we are thrown back on the\u00a0 common law powers of the officer.<br\/><br\/>Among the public officers who may arrest for a felony or a breach of the peace in their presence are the sheriff, the coroner and the constable (2 Blackstone's Com. 292), who are\u00a0 included in\u00a0 the technical term \"peace officers,\" and the general trend of American decisions appears to be that local officers such as policemen who are neither sheriffs, coroners, nor constables shall\u00a0 not be presumed to have such power without a statutory grant of it.\u00a0 There are, on the other hand, decisions indicating that what the law looks to is the character of the duty to be discharged by the officer, rather than the name under which he acts, and that all officers having the general attributes of constables may be inferred to be clothed with\u00a0 their ordinary powers of arrest.\u00a0 Whatever may be the historically correct theory in any one of the several\u00a0 States of the Union, we think that, under the circumstances existing in these Islands, in the absence of an express legislative definition of the faculties of police officers, they must be assumed to possess those powers necessary to the convenient exercise of the duties for which their offices\u00a0 were created.\u00a0 The creation of the office of policeman implies the ability of the incumbent\u00a0 to perform the functions usually inherent in it, and wherever in any American jurisdiction we find such powers in terms conferred by a legislative grant, they appear uniformly to include those proper to peace officers, and among these none is more important that the power to make arrests.\u00a0 See for example the Constabulary Act, No. 175. We therefore hold that, in the absence of any other disposition in the statutes or in the local ordinances, a duly appointed police officer in these Islands has those powers which, under the common law of England and\u00a0 America, belong to a peace officer, and among them the power to arrest without warrant for offenses of this nature committed in his presence.<br\/><br\/>Third. The accused, Vallejo, set up as a further defense double jeopardy, alleging a former conviction under the municipal ordinance as a bar to his prosecution under the Penal Code.\u00a0 The merits of that contention are covered by our discussion in the case of the United States <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> Gavieres (10\u00a0 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 694),\u00a0 in which the majority of the court held that the double prosecution under a municipal ordinance and a general law would lie,\u00a0 and although that decision is now on appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, we regard it as binding upon us in the present case, so that the defense must be overruled.<br\/><br\/>It has been suggested that it is unnecessary to rely upon. the Gavieres case, inasmuch as it will bear a distinction from the one before us, on the ground that, while the conviction of Gavieres was for one act viewed in two different aspects, in the present case the act of resistance to the policemen, which characterizes the offense under the Penal Code, did not necessarily enter into the disorderly conduct of the defendants, which indeed preceded the appearance of the policemen, and was not therefore\u00a0 to\u00a0 be considered as part of the same act.\u00a0 But a reference to the complaint before the justice of the peace in the first prosecution shows that this resistance was there specified as a constituent part of the disorder, and for this reason the suggested distinction between the two cases can not be accepted as wholly satisfactory.<br\/><br\/>The offense of Vallejo falls under the second paragraph of article 249 of the Penal Code, as\u00a0 it amounted to a resistance to public\u00a0 officers while executing their\u00a0 duty. As he has been proved to be a public official, that is, a sanitary officer duly commissioned, he conies within subdivision second of article 250, entailing upon him an\u00a0 increased punishment, while on the other hand, having been intoxicated, without being an habitual drunkard, he is entitled to that as one extenuating circumstance.\u00a0 He is sentenced to <i>prision mayor<\/i> for two years, four months and one day, with a fine of P100.\u00a0 In the case of Bias Ausina, no one of the circumstances specified in the four numbered paragraphs of article 250 exists, and therefore he is sentenced to <i>prision correccional<\/i> for one year eight months and twenty-one days, and a fine of P100; each of the defendants to pay one-half of the costs.\u00a0 The sentence\u00a0 of the court below is revoked in so far as it may be in conflict with the foregoing, and in all other respects, as modified thereby, is affirmed.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J.,\u00a0 Torres, Mapa, <\/i>and <i>Carson JJ., <\/i>concur.<br\/><br\/><b>WILLARD, J.,<\/b> <i>concurring in the result:<\/i><br\/><br\/>I agree with the result, but think that it appears from the judgment of the justice of the peace that the defendants were there tried only for the offense committed\u00a0 prior to the arrival of the police.<\/div>",

Two witnesses for the appellee testified that at the request of the deceased they went to Benguet to search for the boy, found him, and brought him\u00a0 back.\u00a0 The letter in question purports to be a letter written by\u00a0 the deceased to one of the foremen engaged in the construction of the road and contained a request that the foreman send his son\u00a0 back.\u00a0 Whether the authenticity of the letter\u00a0 was sufficiently proven or not, we do not decide, because,\u00a0 if there were error in its admission, such error can not in any way affect the result.<br\/><br\/>The case of the appellee did not rest upon the circumstances connected with his escape to Benguet, in fact that evidence was introduced in rebuttal, but it rested on the testimony of witnesses who knew the child when he\u00a0 was born, and of the subsequent treatment of him\u00a0 by his father.\u00a0 Even if all of the evidence relating to the journey to Benguet were stricken out, that which remains would strongly preponderate in favor of the appellee.\u00a0 Under such circumstances, the order can not be reversed, even if there were error in the admission of this letter.<br\/><br\/>The order appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

AGRIPINO MACASAET, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MAPA, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">It was proven at the trial that the accused had been selling native wine at retail without the license required by the law.\u00a0 The evidence consists of the testimony of two witnesses whom\u00a0 we consider worthy of credit.\u00a0 One of them, William Bigger, sergeant of the Ninth Cavalry, United States Army, declares that he bought wine from the defendant on four different occasions, and that the last\u00a0 time was between the\u00a0 1st and the 5th of September, 1907, on which occasion the accused gave him half a bottle of wine, for which he paid the latter 35 or 40 centavos, Philippine currency.\u00a0 This last purchase was made in the presence of the other witness, James B, Jelks, a corporal of the same regiment of cavalry, who saw the former witness receive the bottle of wine from the defendant and pay its price to the latter.<br\/><br\/>The accused in testifying at the trial, said nothing tending to overcome the declarations of the witness Bigger regarding the first purchases\u00a0 of wine which the latter declares he made from the former, for which reason the testimony of the said witness on this point is competent. With regard to the sale effected in the earlier part of September, the accused expressly admits the material fact of having delivered wine to the witness, but he states that he\u00a0 gave it to him as a mere gift without receiving any payment for it.\u00a0 That wine, according to the accused, was the\u00a0 rest of the wine he had ordered that afternoon in order to entertain the doctor who\u00a0 was attending his sick daughter.\u00a0 The doctor, or rather the medical student, as he really is, to whom the accused refers, confirms the fact that the latter sent for some wine in order to entertain him, and it was also so declared by the person who purchased the wine by order of the accused.\u00a0\u00a0 This, however, even supposing that it were true, would not be in conflict with the declarations of the Government witnesses, inasmuch as the accused might have sold to\u00a0 Sergeant Bigger the wine which remained after entertaining the doctor.<br\/><br\/>It is true that the above-mentioned person, who bought the wine for the doctor, states moreover that he witnessed the act of the accused in offering and delivering the wine to Sergeant Bigger, and that the latter did not pay anything for it; but it seems to us that the contrary declaration of Bigger himself and his\u00a0 companion is\u00a0 the more probable, since there is nothing in the record that may explain satisfactorily the alleged gift of the wine in question.\u00a0 The explanation given by the accused, that he offered and gave the bottle of wine\u00a0 to Bigger gratuitously because the latter asked him to sell him on credit a box of cigars, which he\u00a0 refused to do, seems to us somewhat artificial in denial of the report made by\u00a0 the former, that the wine was sold and not given as a gift, which is much more probable and credible, inasmuch as the accused had already sold wine to Bigger on previous occasions,\u00a0 as declared by the latter in the trial without opposition. Moreover, it does not appear to be plausible or logical that the\u00a0 accused was obliged to give or that he did give as a present, half a bottle of wine to Bigger, simply because he did not want to sell on credit a box of\u00a0 cigars to the latter.<br\/><br\/>The fact that the accused had been selling native wine at retail without the necessary license constitutes a violation of section 66, in relation with section\u00a0 68, subsection 5, of the Internal Revenue Law, and the judgment appealed from, in so far as it sentences the said accused to the payment of a fine of P300 and the costs of the trial, and directing him to obtain the required license, is in accordance with the law, and should, therefore, be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>The judgment also sentences the accused to imprisonment for five months in case of insolvency with respect to the fine imposed, and to pay the costs.\u00a0 This imprisonment is subsidiary in its nature, inasmuch as the accused is to suffer the same only in the case of nonpayment of\u00a0 the fine and the costs.\u00a0 In the case at bar, the law does not authorize such subsidiary imprisonment, which is. therefore, illegal.\u00a0 The above-mentioned section 66 of the Internal Revenue Law, in its paragraph No.\u00a0 1, prescribes alternatively the penalty of a fine of not less than 200 nor more than P2,000, or imprisonment not exceeding six months, and in paragraph No. 2, a fine of not more than P1,000, or imprisonment\u00a0 not exceeding six months, or both penalties in the discretion of the court.\u00a0 The imprisonment is prescribed in both paragraphs as a principal penalty, and in this manner only should it be imposed. The fine alone being imposed, imprisonment can not be inflicted subsidiarily in case of insolvency, because the law in question does not so provide.<br\/><br\/>It seems that the judge below imposed the subsidiary imprisonment in view of the provisions of Act No. 1732, section 1 of which provides that \"when a fine is imposed as a whole or any part of the punishment for any criminal offense made punishable\u00a0 by any Act or Acts of the Philippine Commission, the court shall also sentence the guilty person to suffer subsidiary imprisonment until the fine is satisfied,\"\u00a0 This act can not be applied to the present case, inasmuch as it went into effect only on the 1st day of November, 1907, and the trial only took place on September of the same year.\u00a0 It is a well-settled doctrine that penal\u00a0 statutes can not be made retroactive,\u00a0 except in the case they are favorable to the\u00a0 accused.\u00a0 In conformity with said doctrine, article 21 of the Penal Code provides that \"no crime or misdemeanor shall be punished by a penalty which was not established by law prior to its commission.\"<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, except that part thereof which sentences the accused to five months' imprisonment in case of insolvency with respect to the line and the costs,\u00a0 which is hereby reversed, with the costs of this instance against the said accused.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.\u00a0 J., Torres, Carson,\u00a0 Willard, <\/i>and\u00a0 <i>Tracey, JJ.<\/i> concur.<\/div>",

Rep., 604), this court held, in accordance with the judgment of the supreme court of Spain of March 20,1884, that (p. 605)\u2014<br\/><br\/>It is well settled that the contents and mutual relation of the paragraphs of article 392\u00a0 (407 of the Spanish Code) in addition to the express terms of the first paragraph, require for the infliction of the penalties prescribed therein, evidence, of the existence of the characteristic circumstance, which must be fully\u00a0 proven and can not be presumed, that the service has suffered some irregularity by reason of the malversation\u2014not the malversation itself, but some other detriment derived therefrom or some irregularity which\u00a0 is\u00a0 distinctly prejudicial to the good order, policy, and regular course of the public administration.<br\/><br\/>There is some contention by counsel for the appellant that because it appears that the property misappropriated was not carried upon the regular property account of the province, this property was not placed under the official charge of the accused.\u00a0 We are satisfied, however, both from the testimony of the witness himself and from the testimony of Mr. James, chief clerk of the provincial treasurer, that all of this property was placed under the charge of the accused as property clerk of the provincial government of Pampanga.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the record that not only did the accused make full restitution of the identical property of the government which he took for his own use, but that he paid over to the provincial government of Pampanga the total alleged value thereof.\u00a0 Counsel for appellant prays that the province be directed to make a refund of this payment Which the accused testified was made merely to save his official bondsmen from anxiety or trouble. While from the facts before us, it would appear that the province was not entitled to have both the restitution of the property and payment therefor, and that the accused should have said payment returned to him, this question can not properly be decided\u00a0 in this proceeding\u00a0 wherein the province is not a party, and has had no opportunity to be heard.<br\/><br\/>The trial court found the accused\u00a0 guilty of\u00a0 misappropriation of property of the provincial government\u00a0 of Pampanga, \"to the detriment or hindrance of the public service,\" as alleged, and imposed\u00a0 the penalty\u00a0 prescribed in the second paragraph of article 392.\u00a0 This judgment should be and is hereby\u00a0 reversed, and instead thereof,\u00a0 we find the accused guilty of the offense of misappropriation of public property, as defined and penalized in the third paragraph of article 392 of the Penal Code, there being no proof\u00a0 of prejudice or damage to the public service, and in view of all the circumstances, we impose upon him the penalty of suspension for a period of two years and\u00a0 one day, and a fine of P7.27, being five per cent of the value of\u00a0 the property misappropriated, the minimum\u00a0 penalty which we are authorized to impose under the law.\u00a0 The costs of the proceeding in the trial\u00a0 court to be against the accused, and in this court <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de oficio<\/span>.\u00a0 So\u00a0 ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Paragraph 70 of Circular No. 397 reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"No heavily loaded casco, lighter, or other similar craft shall be permitted to move in the Pasig River without being towed by steam or moved\u00a0 by other adequate power.\"<\/blockquote>Paragraph 83 reads, in part, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"For the violation of any of the foregoing regulations, the person offending shall be liable to a fine of not less than P5 and not more than P500, in the discretion of the court.\"<\/blockquote>In this court, counsel for the appellant attacked the validity of paragraph 70 on\u00a0 two grounds: First, that\u00a0 it is unauthorized by section 39 of Act No. 355; and, second, that if the Acts of the Philippine Commission bear the interpretation of authorizing the Collector to promulgate such a law, they are void, as constituting an illegal delegation of legislative power.<br\/><br\/>The Attorney-General does not seek to sustain the conviction but joins with the counsel for the defense in asking for the discharge of the prisoner on the first ground stated by the defense, that the rule of the Collector cited was unauthorized and illegal, expressly passing over the other question of the delegation of legislative power.<br\/><br\/>After argument of the case, this court received a memorandum submitted by the Collector in his own behalf, which has been served on the counsel appearing in the case, with permission to reply.<br\/><br\/>By sections 1, 2, and 3 of Act No. 1136,,passed April 29, 1904, the Collector of Customs is authorized to license craft engaged in the lighterage or other exclusively harbor business of the ports of the Islands, and, with\u00a0 certain exceptions, all vessels engaged in lightering are required to be so licensed.\u00a0 Sections 5 and 3 read as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 5. The Collector of Customs for the Philippine Islands is hereby authorized, empowered, and directed to promptly make and publish suitable rules and regulations to carry this law into effect and to regulate the business herein licensed.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 8.\u00a0 Any person who shall violate the provisions of this Act, or of any\u00a0 rule or regulation made\u00a0 and issued by the Collector of Customs for the Philippine Islands, under and by authority of this Act, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by a fine of not\u00a0 more than one hundred dollars, United States currency, or by both such\u00a0 fine and imprisonment, at\u00a0 the discretion of the\u00a0 court: <i>Provided,<\/i> That violations of law may be punished either by the method prescribed in section seven hereof, or by that prescribed in this section, or by both.\"<\/blockquote>Under this statute, which was not referred to on the argument, or in the original briefs, there is no difficulty in sustaining the regulation of the Collector as coming within the terms of section 5.\u00a0 Lighterage, mentioned in the Act, is the very business in which this vessel was engaged, and when heavily laden with\u00a0 hemp she was navigating the Pasig River below the Bridge of Spain, in the city of Manila.\u00a0 This spot is near the mouth of the river, the docks whereof are used for the purpose of taking on and discharging freight, and we entertain no doubt that it was in a right sense a part of the harbor, without having recourse to the definition of paragraph 8 of Customs Administrative Circular No. 136, which reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The limits of a harbor for\u00a0 the purpose of licensing vessels as herein prescribed (for the lighterage and harbor business) shall be considered to include its confluent navigable rivers and lakes, which\u00a0 are navigable during any season of the year.\"<\/blockquote>The necessity of confiding to some local authority the framing, changing, and enforcing of harbor regulations is. recognized throughout the world, as each region and each harbor requires peculiar rules more minute than could be enacted by the central lawmaking power, and which, when kept within their proper scope, are in their\u00a0 nature police regulations not involving an undue grant of legislative power.<br\/><br\/>The complaint in this instance was framed with reference, as its authority, to sections 311 and 319 [19 and 311] of Act No, 355, of the Philippine Customs Administrative Act, as amended by Acts Nos. 1235 and 1480.\u00a0 Under Act No. 1235, the Collector is not only empowered to make suitable regulations, but also to \"fix penalties for violation thereof,\" not exceeding a fine of P500.<br\/><br\/>This provision of the statute does, indeed, present a serious question.<br\/><blockquote>\"One of the settled maxims in constitutional law is, that the power conferred upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 legislature to make laws can not be delegated by that department to any other body or\u00a0 authority.\u00a0 Where the sovereign power of the State has located the authority, there it must remain; and by the constitutional agency\u00a0 alone the laws must be made until the constitution itself is changed.\u00a0 The power to whose judgment, wisdom, and patriotism\u00a0 this high prerogative has been intrusted can not\u00a0 relieve itself of the responsibility by choosing other agencies\u00a0 upon which the power shall be developed, nor can\u00a0 it substitute the judgment, wisdom, and patriotism of any other body for those to which alone the people have seen fit to confide this sovereign\u00a0 trust\"\u00a0 (Cooley's Constitutional\u00a0 Limitations, 6th ed., p.\u00a0 137.)<\/blockquote>This doctrine is based on\u00a0 the ethical principle that\u00a0 such a delegated power constitutes not only a right but a duty to be performed by the delegate by the instrumentality of his own judgment acting inmediately upon the matter of legislation and not through the intervening mind of another.\u00a0 In the case of the\u00a0 United States vs. Breen (40 Fed. Rep., 402), an Act of Congress allowing the Secretary of War to make such rules and regulations as might be necessary to protect improvements of the Mississippi River, and providing that a violation thereof\u00a0 should\u00a0 constitute a misdemeanor, was sustained on the ground\u00a0 that the misdemeanor was declared not under the\u00a0 delegated power of the Secretary of War, but in the Act of\u00a0 Congress, itself.\u00a0 So also was a grant to him of power to prescribe rules for the use of canals.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Ormsbee, 74 Fed. Rep., 207.)\u00a0 But a law authorizing him to require alterations of any bridge and to impose penalties for violations of his rules was\u00a0 held invalid, as vesting in him a power exclusively lodged in Congress.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Rider, 50 Fed. Rep., 406.)\u00a0 The subject is\u00a0 considered and some cases reviewed by the Supreme Court of the United States, <i>in re<\/i> Kollock (165 U. S., 526), which upheld the law authorizing a commissioner of internal revenue to designate marks and\u00a0 stamps on oleomargarine packages, an improper use of which should thereafter constitute a crime or misdemeanor, the court saying\u00a0 (p. 533):<br\/><blockquote>\"The criminal offense is fully and completely defined by the Act and the designation by the Commissioner of the particular marks and brands to be used was a mere matter of detail.\u00a0 The regulation was in execution of, or supplementary to, but not in conflict with, the law itself. *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>In Massachusetts it has been decided that the legislature may delegate to the governor and council tHe power to make pilot regulations.\u00a0 (Martin <i>vs.<\/i> Witherspoon et al., 135 Mass., 175.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of The Board\u00a0 of Harbor Commissioners of the Port of Eureka <i>vs.<\/i> Excelsior Redwood Company (88 Cal., 491),\u00a0 it was ruled that harbor commissioners can not impose a penalty under statutes authorizing them to do so, the court saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"Conceding that the legislature could delegate to the plaintiff the authority to make rules and regulations with reference to the navigation of Humboldt Bay, the penalty for the violation of such rules and regulations is a matter purely in\u00a0 the hands of the legislature.\"<\/blockquote>Having reached the\u00a0 conclusion that Act No. 1136\u00a0 is valid, so far as sections 5 and 8 are concerned, and\u00a0 is sufficient to sustain this prosecution, it is unnecessary that we should pass on the questions discussed in the briefs as to the extent and validity of the other acts.\u00a0 The reference to them in the complaint is not material, as we have frequently held that where an offense is\u00a0 correctly described in the complaint an additional reference to a wrong statute is immaterial.<br\/><br\/>We are also of the\u00a0 opinion that\u00a0 none of the subsequent statutes cited operate to repeal the aforesaid section of Act No. 1136.<br\/><br\/>So much of the judgment of the Court of First Instance as convicts the defendant of a violation of Acts Nos. 355 and 1235 is hereby revoked, and he is hereby convicted\u00a0 of a misdemeanor and punished by a fine of 25 dollars, with costs of both instances.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The case has been submitted to\u00a0 this court <i>en consulta.<\/i><br\/><br\/>It appears from the proceedings, and\u00a0 we hold that the same has been proven, that an agreement\u00a0 was previously entered into between the accused and the Moros Mamaku and Macabangan; that\u00a0 on the\u00a0 morning of the 22d of January, 1906, the three being armed respectively with a <i>campilan<\/i>, a <i>cris<\/i>, and a lance, started from Calilangan, the place of their rendezvous, for the military post of Parang, district of Cotabato, Moro Province, with the express object of stealing rifles from the soldiers stationed there and killing the latter if necessary to attain their object; that they reached the neighborhood of said military post at dusk,\u00a0 halted and waited\u00a0 until night\u00a0 was well advanced, and at a late hour\u00a0 they took up positions near the barracks until \"taps\" were sounded and everything was quiet in the post; that they\u00a0 then entered\u00a0 it and cautiously ascended the stairs of some houses in order to see if there were any rifles in\u00a0 them, but seeing none, they went in the direction of a field tent that was occupied at the time by\u00a0 five\u00a0 sick soldiers,\u00a0 the door\u00a0 of\u00a0 which was strongly\u00a0 tied to the pole, and the side\u00a0 walls being well secured to pegs driven in the ground; that before reaching the tent\u00a0 the accused and Macabangan\u00a0 left Mamaku\u00a0 in charge of their effects under a cocoanut\u00a0 tree\u00a0 about\u00a0 70 yards away, and the two continued their way to the tent; that, defeating the vigilance of a sentry on duty near the tent, the two,\u00a0 that is,\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused and Macabangan,. cut the ropes at the rear of the said tent, entered\u00a0 it and suddenly fell upon two of the soldiers who were inside, wounding them with\u00a0 the arms they carried, running away immediately after the deed.\u00a0 All of this took place in the early morning\u00a0 of the 23d of January, while\u00a0 the two soldiers who were the\u00a0 victims of the\u00a0 aggression,\u00a0 and who turned out to be Harry Wickham and James W. McDonald, were asleep.\u00a0\u00a0 The former was apparently but slightly wounded, while the latter received two wounds, one of which proved mortal, and died in consequence in the evening of the 25th, that is, three days after the occurrence.<br\/><br\/>The accused acknowledged that he traveled from Calilangan to Parang in company with Macabangan and Mamaku; his exculpation has simply tended to establish the fact that his meeting\u00a0 the others on the road was merely casual, and that he did\u00a0 not reach the military post at Parang because he remained on the night in question in the sitio of Pangui, distant,\u00a0 according to the evidence, about 900 yards from said post.\u00a0 He states that his object in going to Parang was to\u00a0 buy cotton, clothes, and <i>buyo<\/i>; that\u00a0 when in Calilaiigan he met Macabangan and Mamaku who were also on their way\u00a0 to Parang, for which reason they\u00a0 traveled together; that before reaching Parang the others left him\u00a0 in the sitio called Pangui, telling him that they would go straight on to\u00a0 the market to buy buyo, he\u00a0 being then ignorant of their intention to kill Americans ; that he remained in Pangui because, having reached it at dusk, he thought that he would not have sufficient time to buy the things that he needed, and furthermore, because, as he was armed, he decided upon passing the night in said place in order to await some person who was a friend of the Americans and thus be able to enter the town on the following day with his weapons and make his purchases, or else to hide his weapons, go to the market and return\u00a0 afterwards to recover them; but that in the morning Mamaku and Macabangan came back running and told him\u00a0 that they had killed\u00a0 some Americans, and in view thereof he escaped with them.<br\/><br\/>The important point in the above declaration is that which refers to the fact asserted by the accused of\u00a0 having remained all the night in question at the sitio of Pangui. If this were true it is evident that he could not have taken actual, part in the aggression from which resulted the death of the soldier McDonald.\u00a0 But there is conclusive evidence to the contrary.\u00a0 Pangui is\u00a0 about 900 yards distant from the military post of Parang.\u00a0 If only Mamaku and Macabangan had entered the said post, the accused having\u00a0 remained in Pangui, but two aggressors would have been seen in the neighborhood of the tent immediately after the aggression; however, witness Walker, one of the soldiers who were\u00a0 in the\u00a0 said tent, testified that there were three.\u00a0 This witness heard the noise of the blow that wounded Wickham, and when he saw that McDonald had also been wounded, he jumped out of his cot, he says, with such rapidity that he carried the mosquito net with him.\u00a0 To\u00a0 quote the witness's own words: \"After hearing the first shot I jumped to my feet and\u00a0 ran to the\u00a0 rear of the tent and raised the\u00a0 flaps; I then saw <i>three\u00a0 native Moros<\/i> running toward the place where the new hospital is located.\"<br\/><br\/>The place where the cocoanut tree is located is only about seventy\u00a0 yards distant from the tent where the deceased, McDonald, was wounded.\u00a0 The fact that three Moros were seen at\u00a0 such a place and\u00a0 at such time instead of two, indubitably proves that the accused, far from remaining in Pangui, which is at a distance of more than 800 yards from said point, together with his companions Mamaku and Macabangan entered the military post of Parang where the affray took place, as was actually testified to by Mamaku.<br\/><br\/>It is shown by the evidence that the deceased McDonald was wounded with a lance, and that the weapon that the accused carried was a <i>campilan<\/i>.\u00a0 The lance was carried by his companion Macabangan.\u00a0 In view of this fact it seems clear that it was the latter, and not the former, who attacked and wounded McDonald: The person who was attacked and wounded by the accused was the other soldier,\u00a0 Wickham.\u00a0 However, the liability of the accused as to the wounds and subsequent\u00a0 death of McDonald is exactly the same as if he had personally caused them, because the acts of both of\u00a0 them, that is, the said accused and Macabangan, were concerted and directed toward the carrying out of the same purpose, previously resolved and agreed upon by them, either to steal rifles from the soldiers or kill them.\u00a0 The unity of purpose and of action resulting from such agreement under which they acted when carrying out the aggression\u00a0 of\u00a0 which the deceased\u00a0 McDonald was the victim, makes them jointly liable for the whole of the consequences of the aggression in which the accused certainly took as direct a part as his companion Macabangan.<br\/><br\/>As the deceased was attacked in such a sudden and unexpected manner while asleep, it was materially impossible for him to make any defense or oppose any resistance to the aggression.\u00a0 Under the circumstances, the aggressors acted with entire safety and without the least risk; to themselves, which fact determines the aggravating circumstance of treachery, justly considered by the\u00a0 court below as qualifying the crime as that of murder as charged in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The court below has also justly considered the concurrence of the aggravating circumstance of\u00a0 deliberate premeditation,\u00a0 clearly demonstrated by the\u00a0 agreement that preceded the execution of the crime, followed by a long journey made with the exclusive object of carrying it out, and by the careful precautions taken by the accused and his companions when nearing the military post of Parang to hide themselves during the evening and the early hours of night, and to enable them to enter the camp and carry out their wicked intent when they considered that the proper time therefor had arrived; they afterwards\u00a0 went peeping into different houses looking for rifles and\u00a0 to thus determine which house they should break into; all of which clearly shows that, after they decided to commit the crime, they persisted in their intention, carefully and deliberately considering and calculating the\u00a0 manner and means which would, in their opinion, insure the consummation of\u00a0 their criminal intent with the greatest safety; these facts constitute the\u00a0 aggravating circumstance of premeditation.\u00a0 The court below has likewise justly considered the other aggravating circumstance of forcible entry.<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as in the commission of the crime\u00a0 herein aggravating circumstances are present without any\u00a0 mitigating circumstance to\u00a0 offset them,\u00a0 the penalty must\u00a0 be imposed on the accused in its maximum degree, which in the present case is that of death,\u00a0 (Art. 403, Penal Code.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment is hereby affirmed.\u00a0 The penalty of death imposed on the accused shall be executed on the day and hour to be previously appointed in the manner prescribed by\u00a0 the law, with the costs\u00a0 of this instance against\u00a0 the accused.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

PRAUTCH, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MAPA, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\"> Proceedings for libel were instituted upon the following-complaint :<br\/><blockquote>\"That the said accused, with malicious intent and purpose, in order to discredit the dignity of Oapt. Robert Page, of the Constabulary, and chief inspector of the Province of Oriental Negros, caused a letter written in both English and Spanish, with the heading of 'The situation in Oriental Negros,' written since the 3d of January of the present year, to be inserted in No. 1074 of the newspaper<i> El Tiempo<\/i>, published in Iloilo, Panay, P. I., on the 13th of January, 1903 (should be 1905), containing the following paragraphs:<br\/><br\/>\" '1. Complaints are on file with the provincial governor of the methods employed by Captain Page, of the Constabulary, to openly oppose the religious liberty of the people.<br\/><br\/>\" '2. Captain Page is charged with taking the president of Amblang by the scruff of the neck and forcing him to' kneel down to Bishop Rooker, although the man protested that he was an Aglipayano.<br\/><br\/>\" '3. Captain Page accompanied Bishop Rooker with twenty-five Constabulary soldiers; he forbade their going near the Aglipay Bishop, but ordered them to go and salute Bishop Rooker.<br\/><br\/>\" '4. I learned from other sources that one of these petitions refers to Captain Page putting his revolver to a man's head in Bais and through fear trying to get him to denounce the wealthy Sr. Villanueva, an Aglipayano, as plotting insurrection.<br\/><br\/>\" '5. Ten of the leading persons here told me that they heard Captain Page publicly boast that Bishop Rooker would get him promoted for what he was doing, as he (Rooker) had great influence and could get what he requested or demanded.<br\/><br\/>\" '6. Captain Page refused to allow the Constabulary soldiers to even go and see the parade, saying he did not know that it was a holiday.' \"<\/blockquote>The court below found the accused guilty of the crime of libel, defined and punished by Act No. 277 of the Philippine Commission, and imposed on him a fine of ?500, and the costs of the proceedings. Said sentence rested on the ground that the facts imputed to Captain Page are false, and that the publication thereof was made without justifiable reasons.<br\/><br\/>The injurious nature of the publication appears by a simple perusal of the same. Some of the facts therein imputed to Captain Page, for instance, such as are contained in paragraphs 2 and 4, transcribed in the complaint, if true, would constitute actual crimes, punishable under the Penal Code. The defense itself does not discuss this point, but rather takes it for granted in the brief filed with this court.<br\/><br\/>Neither does the defense discuss the falsity of the imputations, or at least of some of them. The accused himself, when testifying at the trial, distinctly acknowledged that the second imputation, that Captain Page had forcibly compelled the president of Amblang to salute and kneel down to Bishop Rooker, was false.\u00a0 In the brief the defense says:<br\/><blockquote>\"If by the evidence adduced he (the accused) has not succeeded in showing the rigorous truth of the allegations, but only a part of them, he has, however, sufficiently shown the existence of justifiable reasons.\"<\/blockquote>This last statement and the absence of malice in the publication constitute in sum the exculpations alleged and maintained in the brief of the accused.<br\/><br\/>As to malice, it is a thing which the law presumes to exist in injurious publications. Section 3 of Act No. 277 provides that\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"An injurious publication is presumed to have been malicious if no justifiable motive for making it is shown.\"<\/blockquote>In the absence of such proof, the legal presumption of malice must stand. In order to establish absence of malice as a fact, it previously becomes necessary to prove that justifiable motives existed for the publication. The proposition can not be inverted. Therefore, the argument of the accused in his brief, that, it being proved that no malice existed, the existence of justifiable motives is necessarily proven, is untenable. This would amount to supposing that the legal presumption of malice could be destroyed otherwise than by proving the existence ;of justifiable motives, which is manifestly contrary to the clear and express provision of the law. Consequently, the whole of this question is reduced to whether or not there were justifiable motives for the publication.<br\/><br\/>With regard to this point the accused states as follows in his declaration:<br\/><blockquote>\"The only intention I had (in publishing the letter in <i>El Tiempo<\/i>) was to promote the separation of the church and the state; it will be observed in my article that I have omitted every allusion to any other act by Captain Page, only touching the religious persecution, in the separation of the church and the state.\"<\/blockquote>And further on he adds that the object of the publication was to call the attention of the Governor-General and other citizens to the religious abuses.<br\/><br\/>In the first place, it is not true that the letter in question refers solely to the so-called religious abuses supposed to have been committed by Captain Page. Thus, for instance, the fact stated in paragraph 6 of the complaint, that Captain Page did not permit the Constabulary soldiers to go and see the parade on Rizal Bay, telling them that he did not acknowledge said day as a holiday, has nothing to do with the religious question, nor with the separation of the church and the state.<br\/><br\/>In the second place, the desire to promote the separation of the church and the state, supposing that such was the only motive that led the accused to publish the letter in question, does not <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">per se <\/span>constitute a motive sufficiently justifiable for the publication. The goodness of the intention is not always sufficient by itself to justify the publication of an injurious fact; thus the goodness of the end is not a sufficient motive to warrant the employment of illicit means to obtain it. The existence of justifiable motives is a question which has to' be decided by taking into consideration not only the intention of the author of the publication but all the other circumstances of each particular case.<br\/><br\/>A careful examination of the cause shows that the accused did not have the slightest reason for publishing several of the facts imputed to Captain Page. To begin with, there is not the least evidence that the latter performed the acts which the accused attributes to him in paragraphs 5 and 6 transcribed in the complaint; neither does he prove, and this is of great importance, that some one had informed him that these deeds were executed by Captain Page. It can not therefore be understood what grounds the accused had for imputing such acts to Captain Page, and much less for making the allegations publicly.<br\/><br\/>The same may be said of the fact stated in paragraph 2 of the complaint. In the original of this paragraph, in the English text, the force and violence said to have been exercised by Captain Page on the person of the president of Amblang is illustrated by the statement that he caught the latter by the scruff of the neck and compelled him to kneel down to Bishop Rooker. Exhibit A of the defense, which is a certified copy of the record written and subscribed by several municipal presidents of the Province of Oriental Negros, regarding certain petitions that they had resolved to submit to the Governor-General, which record has apparently served the accused as the source of infor\u00admation in connection with this fact, contains only the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"When Mgr. Rooker passed through Amblang, Captain Page made use of his <i>moral<\/i> force to compel the municipal president to go and salute the Roman Bishop, in order that said bishop might thus gain influence with the re\u00adsidents, on seeing that he was saluted by their president.\"<\/blockquote>The president of Amblang himself does not say other than that Captain Page invited him to salute Bishop Rooker at the convent, using the following words: \"Come on, president; if you don't care to go, suit yourself.\" Nothing in this justifies the charge that Captain Page compelled the president of Amblang <i>by means of force and catching him by the scruff of the neck to<\/i> salute Bishop Rooker, and to <i>kneel down<\/i> to him; and much less, as a consequence, the publication of such an imputation.<br\/><br\/>Nor had anyone informed the accused that Captain Page had threatened a person in Bais with a revolver, in order to compel him to denounce the wealthy landowner Sr. Villanueva as an <i>Aglipayano and promoter of a revolutionary movement<\/i>, as stated in paragraph 4 of the complaint. What appears from Exhibit B and from the testimony of the witnesses of the defense is that Captain Page threatened and maltreated with a revolver a certain Fernando Alcasa, a man supposedly guilty of breaking into the house of a certain Montenegro, to make him declare that he had been induced thereto by the Villanuevas. As it may easily be observed, this has nothing to do with compelling him to denounce Villanueva as an Aglipayano and promoter of a revolutionary movement. There is here at least an evident misstatement of the facts, made probably with the intention of connecting them in some way with the religious question with which the accused pretends to shield himself.<br\/><br\/>The least that can be said of this is that which is staged in the judgment appealed from, namely:<br\/><blockquote>\"That the degree of care which he employed to investigate the truth of the complaints so injurious to another person, such as these complaints might be to Captain Page,was not sufficient to warrant their publication in the manner in which he did it.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the accused.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Willard<\/i> and <i>Tracey, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><i>Carson, J.,<\/i> concurs in the result<br\/><i>Arellano, C.

O \u00bfes delito de estafa el apropiarse el comisionista, en tal caso, el presio obtenido de la venta realizada, sea el mismo se\u00f1alado o menor del se\u00f1alado?<br\/><br\/>Si constituye estafa el vender por precio menor del se\u00f1alado en la comision de venta la cosa recibida en tal concepto, entonces el due\u00f1o de la casa asi vendida no ha perdido legalmente su posesion y esta debe serle restituida o por el delicuante o por el tercero que por modo ilicito hubo de adquirir la posesion de la cosa ilicitamente vendida, y entonces es procedente la aplicacion de aquellos articulos citados del Codigo Penal y debe y debe la cosa misma estafada ser retituida o por el delincuente o por el tercero que injestamente la retiene en su poder como objeto de un estafa cometida por el que se la vendio.<br\/><br\/>Pero si no constituye estafa el hecho de que se trata, porque no este penado en ley alguna, el acto de trasmision de la cosa vendida por tal manera a un tercero, como quiera que sea entre comitente u comisioniste, aumque haya sido ilegitimo por parte de este ultimo, lo cierto seria despues de todo que entre vendedor y comprador no habia sido ilicito, y basta que no sea ilicito, por no ser producto de un delito, para que la adquisicion sea legal, y la posesion justa y legitima, sin que el proceder ilegitimo del vendor al extralimitarse de los terminos de su comision pueda afectar al comprador de buena fe a quien no se le prueba que era saberdor de la ilegitimidad de tal proceder.<br\/><br\/>En resolucion de la cuestion, decimos: que el hecho de vender un mandatario o comisionista por menos precio del que le fue se\u00f1alado la cosa que recibio en comision de venta no constituye delito de estafa, por no estar penado como tal en ninguno de los articulos de Codigo Penal.\u00a0 Pero el apropiarse el comisionista el precio obtenido de la venta, sea cual fuera, es delito de estafa, porque es apropiarese o distraer para si dinero que recibio en comision o a los efectos de la comision que habia recibido.<br\/><br\/>Reo de estafa por el dinero apropiado, es esta cantidad distraida o estafada la que debe restituir, no las cosa misma de que se obtuvo el dinero como precio.<br\/><br\/>La cosa vendida, aunque malvendida, pasa al dominio del comprador que la ha adquirido valida y eficazmente por un titulo perfectamente traslative de dominio cual la venta hecha por el due\u00f1o o por su mandatario autorizada para el efecto salvo alguna accion civil, sicabe, por ejemplo, de quanti minoris; por tanto no debe ser retituida como efecto de un acto constitutivo de delito y no traslativo de dominio.<br\/><br\/>El hecho constitutivo de delito no fue el vender la cosa, porque en ello estaba el due\u00f1o de ella que la entrgo al vendedar para este efecto; la fue el haberse apropiado el vendedor el precio de la venta que habia obtenido no para si sino para su comitente y no lo habia podido del aquel dinero.\u00a0 La comision, unico titulo que le asistia, obligabale o a la devolucion de la cosa o a la entrega del precio que sucede en lugar de la cosa una vez vendida: a uno u otro fin tendia la comision.<br\/><br\/>Es consiguiente que la acusada, en los dos casos de venta de alhajas a Jose Tejuco y Magdalena de Castro, fue bien condenada como rea de estafa por haberse apropiado el importe obtenido de la venta, y este importe es el que debe restituir o indemnizar; no pudiendo ser objeto de retitucion o indemnizacion las alhajas mismas, por no haber sido ilicito no constitutivo de delito de estafa el hecho de haberlas vendido por menos precion del que la habia sido se\u00f1alado en la comision.<br\/><br\/>Otro hecho ejecutado por la acusada fue el de vender otro anillo a Teodora Tejuco.\u00a0 Acerca de este hecho la conclusion de la sentencia es\"- \"El Juzgado determina y falla, que el anillo vendido por la acusada a Teodora Tejuco fue vendido en el precio fijado para el mismo entre la acusada y la ofendida y que por lo tanto dicha Teodora Tejuco ha adquirido un titulo valido sobre el mismo y dicho anillo debe serle entregado a ella inmediatamente por el Escribano de este Juzgado.\"\u00a0 La ofendiada Ramona R. Evangelista se alzo de esta sentencia, y es la tercera de las apelaciones elevadas a este Tribunal.<br\/><br\/>El pronunciamiento de la sentencia apelada esta an un todo arreglado a derecho.\u00a0 Es ciertamente un titulo valido y eficaz el de Teodora Tejuco, a saber, la venta por modo ninguno rebatible, realizada por una mandataria o comisionista conforme a los terminos de su mandato o comision.\u00a0 Y si la alhaja fue legalmente trasladada a la posesion de la compradora por un titulo valido y eficaz, no puede ser objeto de restitucion.<br\/><br\/>No hay vicio en el titulo para que haga la compradora su restitucion.\u00a0 Si la adquirio legalmente, legalmente la posee.\u00a0 Y no se restituya lo que bien se posee.<br\/><br\/>Dice la parte apelante que debe ser restituida por ser efecto de delito; pero en esto hay una anfibologia o equivcacion.\u00a0 No es efecto de delito la posesion; eslo de contrato valido y eficaz.\u00a0 El delito resulto despues de realizado el contrati, despues de consumada licita y legitimamente la posesion, en cuanto la mandataria o comisionista se hubo de apropiar el precio obtenido.<br\/><br\/>Este precio obtencio, objeto de distraccion o ilicita apropiacion, fue la materia del delito de estafa con arreglo al Art. 535 caso 5.o del Codigo Penal; mas no el haberlo obtenido de una venta ejecutada con toda licitud.<br\/><br\/>Por los fundamentos, respectivamente expuestos, revocamos los pronunciamientode la sentencia, objeto de las apelaciones interpuestas por Jose Tejuco y Magdalena de Castro, en cuanto declaran no haber lugar a la restitucion de los anillos y alhajas vendidos a dichas personas por Juliana Torres, y confirmanos el pronunciamiento contra que ha apelado la ofendida Ramona R. Evangelist.\u00a0 Sin especial condena de costas en esta instancia Transcurridos 20 dias dictese sentencia en estos terminos, y a los 10 de dictada, devuelvase lo pertinente del expediente, al Juzgado de origen.<br\/><br\/>Asi se ordena.<br\/><br\/><i>Gomez, Johnson, Carson<\/i> y <i>Tracey.<\/i><\/div><\/div>",

AGUSTIN ASENCIO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Plaintiff and defendant were members of a partnership doing business under the firm name of <i>Asencio y Cia<\/i>. The business of the partnership did not prosper and it was dissolved by mutual agreement of the members. The plaintiff brings this action to recover from the defendant, who appears to have been left in charge of the books and the funds of the firm, the amount of the capital which he had invested in the business. The defendant, alleging that there had been considerable losses in the conduct of the business of the partnership, denied that there was anything, due the plaintiff as claimed, and filed a cross complaint wherein he prayed for a judgment against the plaintiff for a certain amount which he alleged to be due by the plaintiff under the articles of partnership on account of plaintiff's share of these losses.<br\/><br\/>The trial court found that the evidence substantially sustains the claim of the defendant as to the alleged losses in the business of the partnership and gave judgment in his favor.<br\/><br\/>The only question submitted on appeal is the competency and sufficiency of the evidence on which the trial court based its findings as to the status of the accounts of the company.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff and appellant makes the following assignment of errors:<br\/><br\/>First. The trial court erred in holding the <i>estado de cucntas<\/i> (statement of account) of the partnership of<i> Asencio y Cia<\/i>. submitted by the defendant as competent and sufficient evidence in this case.<br\/><br\/>Second. The trial court erred in holding that the evidence of record proved the existence of losses in the business of the said partnership.<br\/><br\/>Third. The trial court erred in refusing to give judgment in favor of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the record that by mutual agreement the defendant had general charge and supervision of the books and funds of the firm, but it appears that these books were at all times open to the inspection of the plaintiff, and there is evidence which tends to show that the plaintiff himself made entries in these books touching particular transactions in which he happened to be interested ; so that while it is clear that the defendant was more especially burdened with the care of the books and accounts of the partnership, it would appear that the plaintiff had equal rights with the defendant in this regard, and that during the existence of the partnership they were equally responsible for the mode in which the books were kept and that the entries made by one had the same effect as if they had been made by the other.<br\/><br\/>At the trial the principal question at issue was the amount of the profits or losses of the business of the partnership during the period of its operation. The plaintiff made no allegation as to profits, but denied defendant's allegation as to the losses. The defendant in support of his allegations offered in evidence the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">estado de cuentas<\/span> (general statement of accounts) of the partnership, supported by a number of vouchers, and by his own testimony under oath as to the accuracy and correctness of the items set out therein. The plaintiff assigns as error the admission of this account on the ground that the books of the partnership were not kept in accordance with the provisions of Title III, Book I, of the (lode of Commerce.<br\/><br\/>It is not necessary for us to consider this assignment of error as to the inadmissibility of this account on the ground that the books were not kept in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Code, because no objection was made to its admission in the court below; and further, because in any event it was admissible under the provisions of section 338 of the Code of Civil Procedure as a memorandum used to refresh the memory of the witness. (Tan Machan <i>vs.<\/i> Gan Aya, 3 Phil. Rep., 684.) We think further that in view of the testimony of record that the plaintiff jointly with the defendant kept these hooks, made entries therein, and was responsible1 with him therefor, the doctrine laid down in Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Rosatzin (5 Phil. Rep., 660) is applicable in this case, and the correctness of the entries in these books must be taken to be admitted by him, except so far as it is made to appear that they are erroneous as a result of fraud or mistake.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the record that the statement of account, the vouchers, and the books of the company were placed at the disposition of the plaintiff for more than six weeks prior to the trial, and that during the trial he was given every opportunity to indicate any erroneous or fraudulent items appearing in the account, yet he was unable, or in any event he declined to specify such items, contenting himself with a general statement to the effect that there must be some mistake, as he did not and could not believe that the business had been conducted at a loss.<br\/><br\/>The court below seems to have scrutinized the account with painstaking care, and to have been satisfied as to its accuracy, except as to some unimportant items, which he corrected, but counsel for the appellant reiterates in this court his general allegations as to the inaccuracy of the account, and points out some instances wherein he alleges that items of expenditure appear to have been charged against the partnership more than once.<br\/><br\/>Upon the whole record as brought here by the appellant we are not able to say that the weight of the evidence does not sustain the findings of the trial court, and the judgment entered in that court should be, and is hereby, affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.

This, however, does not alter the terms of the question.\u00a0 It is not a question of rights, but one of procedure.\u00a0 It may be that the plaintiff would ultimately be entitled to obtain an attachment upon the house, there being no other property subject thereto, but\u00a0 a writ of\u00a0 mandamus is not the adequate means to attain the purpose. An officer can not be compelled, by means of a writ of mandamus, to perform an act not specially prescribed by the law as one of the duties inherent in his office, and in no case is there any provision of law imposing upon a sheriff the obligation to levy upon a specific piece of property when\u00a0 the writ of attachment issued is in\u00a0 general terms against the property of the debtor.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, such an argument contains the defect of\u00a0 taking it for granted that whatever the plaintiff thinks should 1 Resolution of the Supreme Court of April 23, 1900, in the matter of be\u00a0 attached is really subject to execution, while this question may very well be the object of controversy; and, as a matter of fact, such appears to be the case herein, judging by the various petitions presented by the parties before the filing of the amended complaint.\u00a0 The sheriff may, with more or less reason, believe that the thing in\u00a0 question is exempt from execution, in which case a question of law arises which, by reason of its nature, can not clearly be a matter for the application of the remedy of the <i>writ of mandamus.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Further than this there is another reason to deny such a remedy in the present case.\u00a0 The matter at issue is a writ of execution which should have been returned by the sheriff unsatisfied.\u00a0 This case is expressly provided for in the Code of Civil Procedure, in the chapter dealing with proceedings supplementary to the execution of judgments. (Secs. 474 et seq.) The necessary procedure is therein established to obtain an order from the judge directing that any property of the judgment debtor, <i>not exempt by law,<\/i> according to the wording of section 482, be applied toward the satisfaction of the judgment in cases where the writ of execution is entirely or partly unsatisfied.\u00a0 It is feasible to deal with the matter under the procedure thus provided, and it even seems that it should be so treated judging by the underlined words of the section just cited, as to whether or not a determined property of the judgment debtor is exempt from execution, and if under the law it may or may not be levied upon.\u00a0 Since such ordinary and adequate procedure exists therefor, it is evident that the special and extraordinary remedy of a writ of <i>mandamus, <\/i>according to sections 222 and\u00a0 515 of the Code of Civil Procedure,\u00a0 can not be granted under the law.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer is therefore sustained, and the plaintiff is granted ten days in\u00a0 order that he may, if he should desire, file an amended complaint.\u00a0 No special ruling is made as to costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.J., Torres, Willard,<\/i> and <i>Tracey, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><i>Johnson, J.<\/i>, dissents.<br\/><i>Carson, J.<\/i>, reserves his vote.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/> <sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> Resolution of the Supreme Court of April 23, 1906, in the matter of Petersen <i>vs.<\/i> Peterson. <\/div>",

Somes, against Rafael Molina y Salvador, Aniceto Ruiz, Antonio de la Riva, and other defendants, case No. 5448 of the Court of First Instance of Manila.\u00a0 The facts in this case appear to be as follows:<br\/><br\/>By virtue of a written contract, dated Manila, July 27, 1903, Antonio de la Riva became debtor in the sum of $134,630.12, Mexican currency, the price agreed upon for the\u00a0 purchase of certain business in the Island of Catanduanes, belonging to Rafael Molina.\u00a0 This amount was to be paid in installments.<br\/><br\/>On or about the month of January, 1905, Molina filed a complaint in the Court of First\u00a0 Instance of the city of Manila against De la Riva for the recovery of the sum of P33,659.03, one of the installments, which action was registered under No. 3402, and later was brought to this court under No. 2721. (6 Phil. Rep., 12.)<br\/><br\/>On approval of the bill of exceptions in the said case by the lower court, in order to suspend the execution of the sentence of the said court, the defendant, Antonio de la Riva, perfected a bond,\u00a0 which was signed\u00a0 by De la Riva as principal and Enrique F. Somes and Roberto Spalding, jointly, as his sureties for the sum of P35,000.<br\/><br\/>On the 22d of March, 1906, this court rendered its decision in the said case No. 3402 of the court below (No. 2721<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> of the Supreme Court) affirming the sentence appealed from and the case was remanded to the lower court.<br\/><br\/>In the said court the plaintiff, Molina, asked that execution be issued against the said defendant,\u00a0 De la Riva, which execution was returned by the sheriff with the statement that no property belonging to the defendant, De la Riva, could be found within his jurisdiction.\u00a0 The plaintiff then asked the lower court for an <i>alias<\/i> execution against the sureties, Enrique F. Somes and Roberto Spalding, and these persons were cited to appear and show cause why such execution should not issue against them upon their\u00a0 obligation upon the said bond.<br\/><br\/>These sureties alleged that the debtor, De la Riva, had property to the value of more than P200,000 in the Island of Catanduanes, but it appeared that such property was in the hands of a receiver duly\u00a0 appointed,\u00a0 and the lower court therefore issued the order of execution against the said sureties.\u00a0 From this order they appealed to this court. The registered number of that case is 3412<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> in this court. This court decided that appeal (January 19, 1907) affirming the order of the court below and the case was returned to the said lower court, ordering the execution of the former judgment of this court in case No, 3402 (No. 2721 of this court).<br\/><br\/>At the same time this court affirmed another judgment in favor of Molina and against De la Riva (No. 3829 of the court below and No. 3097<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[2]<\/sup> of\u00a0 this court,\u00a0 5 Off. Gaz., 102) and in this last\u00a0 decision of the Supreme Court the appointment of the said receiver of\u00a0 the property belonging to De la Riva was declared null and void.<br\/><br\/>Those cases having been returned to the court below, Molina asked for an execution against the sureties of De la Riva and these sureties appeared before the court and asked that the execution be directed against the property of the debtor, for the reason that\u00a0 this court had already declared null the appointment of the receiver of the property of the said debtor.<br\/><br\/>After various orders had been issued by the court below, the court ordered execution against the sureties.<br\/><br\/>By virtue of the said order of execution, the property of the surety, Enrique F. Somes, was attached and notice of the public sale of the same\u00a0 was given,\u00a0 which\u00a0 sale was had\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 19th of April, 1907, said property being sold to the creditor Molina for the amount of his claim against De la Riva and in satisfaction of the judgment in the said case No. 3402 of the court below (No. 2721 of this court.)<br\/><br\/>One of the sureties, Somes, attempted to\u00a0 have suspended the said execution because of exemption from responsibility as a surety\u00a0 in accordance with article 1852 [Civil Code], which was denied by\u00a0 the lower court.\u00a0 From this order the said Somes attempted to appeal, but the lower court refused to certify\u00a0 the\u00a0 bill of exceptions presented by the said surety, wherefore the said surety\u00a0 then\u00a0 brought an action in this court praying that a mandamus issue (No. 3965<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> of this court) and in these proceedings also prayed that a preliminary injunction be issued, which last prayer was denied.\u00a0 Subsequently this court also held that there were no grounds for the issuance of a writ of mandamus.<br\/><br\/>Six days after the sale of the property of the said surety, Somes, to the creditor, Molina, in satisfaction of his judgment against the said De la\u00a0 Riva, the said surety, Somes, filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila a sworn complaint or petition\u00a0 (No. 5448 of\u00a0 the court below)\u00a0 in which was asked the following relief:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. That the court adjudge, decree, and decide that this plaintiff has the right of preference to levy upon\u00a0 the property of Antonio de la Riva and to be paid from the said property, or the value of the same, the sum of P33,978.70, and costs and expenses, in view of the right of subrogation derived by the judgment rendered in case No. 3402. (No. 2721 of this court.)<br\/><br\/>\"2. That the court issue an injunction against all and each of the defendants,\u00a0 restraining them from executing or performing any act in connection with the judgments or parts thereof rendered in the cases numbered 2944,. 3829, 3863, and 4766, prior to the execution of the judgment rendered in the case numbered 3402, herein referred to, and prohibiting them in conclusion from excluding, depriving, or dispossessing the plaintiff of his\u00a0 right of preference in accordance with the law as a preferred judgment creditor in relation to the property the subject of the execution, which they are now\u00a0 selling or attempting to convert into money.<br\/><br\/>\"3. That for the protection and security of the\u00a0 rights of the plaintiff, and for the reasons herein stated, the court, pending\u00a0 the proceedings in this case, issue a preliminary injunction against all and each of the defendants, restraining them from\u00a0 performing any act, as prayed for in the preceding paragraph, and\u00a0 that notice of such restraining order\u00a0 or preliminary\u00a0 injunction\u00a0 be\u00a0 communicated\u00a0 as quickly as possible to the defendant, the sheriff of Albay, as sheriff, and his deputies.<br\/><br\/>\"4. The plaintiff asks for any other just and equitable remedy, and\u00a0 for any speedy and adequate protection\u00a0 of his rights.\"<\/blockquote>On the 9th day of May the court below denied the petition for an injunction in the above complaint and ordered instead\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"That the proceeds of the sale by virtue of the executions now pending in this court, and in the possession of the sheriff of the Province of Albay, be deposited in the office of the clerk of this court, subject to the order of said court, upon the execution by the plaintiff of a bond for the sum of P10,000, to be approved by that court, as security for the payment of whatever damages may arise from failure to apply the proceeds of said sale to the payments of the above-mentioned executions.\"<\/blockquote>This\u00a0 order\u00a0 of the court below\u00a0 gave rise to a complaint brought by E. F. Somes, against the judge asking for a writ of <i>certiorari<\/i>.\u00a0 In said complaint (No. 4052 of this court) the petitioner\u00a0 asked and obtained an injunction for the suspension of the\u00a0 sale of the property of the debtor, De la Riva, but later on this injunction was dissolved and the petition for a writ of <i>certiorari<\/i> was denied (No. 4052).<br\/><br\/>About the 25th of May, 1907,\u00a0 the attorneys for Rafael Molina, and Messrs. Rosado, Sanz &amp; Opisso, representing the other defendant, Aniceto Ruiz, filed demurrers to the above-mentioned\u00a0 complaint of E. F.\u00a0 Somes (No. 5448 of the court below).<br\/><br\/>The grounds upon which the first of said demurrers is based are: That the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant Molina; that\u00a0 the complaint\u00a0 in this\u00a0 case is mostly conclusions of law, and that\u00a0 the\u00a0 allegations\u00a0 of fact set forth in said complaint do not justify the remedy prayed for by the plaintiff, but on the contrary show by themselves that the complaint should\u00a0 be dismissed (B. of E., p. 8.)\u00a0\u00a0 And that in\u00a0 the second\u00a0 demurrer the complaint does not contain facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action (B. of E., p. 9).<br\/><br\/>The court, after hearing both parties, sustained the demurrers (B. of E., pp. 9, 10, 11, and 12), against which orders the plaintiff excepted (p. 12).<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff then filed a motion asking the court below to amend\u00a0 its order on the ground therein stated.\u00a0 This motion was denied, the plaintiff\" taking an exception, and the complaint not having been amended, the court afterwards made the following order:<br\/><blockquote><div style=\"text-align: center;\">(Heading and title.)<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The demurrers filed by the defendants\u00a0 in the above entitled case have been sustained, and\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff in a written statement dated June 12, 1907, informed the court of his intention not to amend his complaint.<br\/><br\/>\"The remedies prayed for by the plaintiff in\u00a0 his complaint are therefore denied, and the costs are adjudged\u00a0 to the defendants and against the plaintiff.\u00a0 After the costs have been taxed, the\u00a0 clerk\u00a0 will issue the necessary execution at the request of any of the defendants.<br\/><br\/>\"So ordered.<br\/><br\/>\"Manila, June 15, 1907.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"CHAS.\u00a0 H.

That the following civil causes\u00a0 were tried and determined\u00a0 in the Court of First Instance in\u00a0 the order given below:<br\/><blockquote>\"(1)\u00a0 Rafael Molina Salvador <i>vs.<\/i> Antonio de la Riva, No; 3402.\u00a0 Adjudged by the Court of First Instance, April 18, 1905.\u00a0 Decided by the Supreme Court, March 22, 1906.<br\/><br\/>\"(2) Rafael\u00a0 Molina Salvador <i>vs.<\/i> Antonio de la Riva.

Adjudged by the Court of First Instance, February 19, 1907.<br\/><br\/>\"Second. That orders of execution were issued in the above-mentioned cases, as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"In case No. 3402, on April 21,1906.<br\/><br\/>\"In case No. 3944, on January 17, 1907.<br\/><br\/>\"In case No. 3829, on February 19, 1907.<br\/><br\/>\"In case No. 2963, on January 17, 1907, and<br\/><br\/>\"In case No. 4767, on February 19,1907.<br\/><br\/>\"Said orders of execution were addressed to the sheriffs of the city of Manila and of the Province of Albay, wherein the properties of the defendant herein, and likewise defendant in the above-mentioned cases,\u00a0 are located; and that said orders are still pending execution and have not been returned to the Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>\"Third. That in case No. 3402, in\u00a0 which the first judgment was\u00a0 rendered, the plaintiff herein signed an obligation whereby he became a surety for Rafael Molina Salvador, the defendant\u00a0 herein,\u00a0 and that said obligation was paid\u00a0 by the plaintiff herein by the full amount of the execution of the judgment rendered therein, on April 19, 1907.\u00a0 By said execution the real estate of the plaintiff herein was sold at sheriff's sale for the benefit of Rafael Molina and for the recovery of the amount of\u00a0 said execution of the value of P33,578.70,\u00a0 and therefore, according to the provisions of article 1839 of the Civil Code and of article 471 of the Code of\u00a0 Civil Procedure, the plaintiff herein has acquired all rights and interest pertaining to Rafael Molina Salvador in said execution.<br\/><br\/>\"Fourth. That having due regard to the fact that the first judgment against Antonio de la Riva was issued in case No. 3402, the\u00a0 properties belonging to the\u00a0 latter and against which the above-mentioned\u00a0 orders of execution were\u00a0 issued, were, by virtue of an agreement between the parties and of the contracts relied upon by the judgments rendered in the respective eases, specially bound to the satisfaction of the amount in case No. 3402.<br\/><br\/>\"Fifth. That the properties of the defendant Antonio de la Riva, the judgment debtor\u00a0 in all the cases above referred to, are now in the hands of the sheriff of Manila and of the sheriff of Albay, the defendants herein, or their deputies, for the execution of the judgments rendered in favor of the other defendants, with the\u00a0 exception of that rendered in case No. 3402, in spite of the fact that judgment in the latter was rendered first of all.\u00a0\u00a0 That the sheriff of Manila or\u00a0 the sheriff of Albay, or their deputies, is now disposing\u00a0 or is about to dispose\u00a0 at public sale of all the properties of the defendant Antonio de la Riva, bound by the judgments rendered in all the cases with the exception of case No. 3402, and that besides the properties mentioned in the orders of execution issued in the said cases there are no\u00a0 other properties belonging to\u00a0 the defendant,\u00a0 except those covered by case No. 3402 as stated.<br\/><br\/>\"Sixth. As the sheriff's sale has already taken place or is about to take place within a few days, the plaintiff alleges that it is impossible for him to appear and lay his claim before the sheriff of Albay, nor can he obtain judgment in this case before the sale of the properties of the defendant Antonio de la Riva for the\u00a0 satisfaction of the amounts adjudged in said cases, with the exception of case No. 3402, in which judgment was rendered prior to others.\u00a0 Should this be allowed to happen, it will cause the plaintiff irreparable damages,\u00a0 inasmuch as he will be unable to recover, as pertains to him by right, the amount of the execution paid by him by virtue of the above-mentioned bond, and he will be furthermore prejudiced in the exercise of his right of subrogation,\u00a0 according\u00a0 to law, as well as in his right of preference to which he is entitled as the holder of an order of execution issued\u00a0 by virtue of a judgment rendered against the properties of the defendant, Antonio de la Riva, at a date earlier than those of the other judgments.<br\/><br\/>\"Seventh.\u00a0 The plaintiff alleges that the acts executed before, and those being at present executed\u00a0 by the defendants, the sheriff of Manila or the sheriff of the Province of Albay and their deputies, and by Rafael Molina Salvador, Antonio de la Riva, Aniceto Ruiz Velez and Gibbs &amp; Gale, jointly or separately, regarding the execution of the judgments rendered\u00a0 in the cases above mentioned, Nos. 3944, 3829, 3963, and 4766, purport to illegally exclude and to deprive this plaintiff of the enjoyment of his lawful rights by virtue of\u00a0 the preferred judgment rendered in the said case No. 3402, and that he will be in fact dispossessed of the said rights, and deprived and prejudiced in his preferential rights should these executions be carried out.<br\/><br\/>\"Eighth. The plaintiff moreover alleges that against the said Antonio de la Riva there\u00a0 is no other judgment prior to the one rendered in the case No. 3402, which is at present in favor of\u00a0 this plaintiff according to law, and\u00a0 finally alleges that the only proper and available remedy left to this plaintiff, in order to avoid the damages alleged in the previous paragraph, and to preserve and guarantee his rights, is the issuance of a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants and each of them\u00a0 from executing or trying to execute, from receiving or trying to receive payment under the judgments or as a result thereof, or in any other way to receive and dispose of the property or\u00a0 any part thereof, or of the proceeds of the property of the defendant Antonio de la Riva, before the judgment rendered in the case No. 3402 of the Court of First Instance of Manila is totally paid to this plaintiff,\u00a0 as\u00a0 the person subrogated in\u00a0 the rights of Rafael Molina Salvador by virtue of the judgment rendered in the said case No. 3402.<br\/><br\/>\"In view of all the above said, the plaintiff herein asks:<br\/><br\/>\"1. That the court declare, decree, and decide that this plaintiff\u00a0 has the right of preference to have an execution against the property of Antonio de la Riva and to be paid by\u00a0 the said\u00a0 property\u00a0 or by the proceeds thereof, to the amount of P33,978.70 plus the costs and expenses, by virtue of his lawful subrogation\u00a0 to the rights derived from the judgment rendered in the case No. 3402.<br\/><br\/>\"2. That this court issue a writ of\u00a0 injunction against all and each of the defendants, prohibiting\u00a0 them from executing or performing\u00a0 any act\u00a0 tending\u00a0 to execute and to make effective any of the judgments or any part of the judgments rendered in the cases Nos. 3944, 3829, 3963, and 4766, before the execution of the judgment rendered in the case No. 3402, hereinbefore mentioned, and prohibiting them in conclusion from excluding, depriving, or dispossessing the plaintiff of the right\u00a0 of preference conferred upon him by law, as a preferred judgment creditor to the\u00a0 property subject to execution, which they\u00a0 are selling now or attempting to convcrt into money.<br\/><br\/>\"3. That for the protection and guaranty of this plaintiff's rights, and for the reasons\u00a0 herein stated, the court, pending the proceedings in this case, issue a preliminary injunction against all and each of the defendants, as stated and asked for in the preceding paragraph, and that such prohibition or preliminary injunction\u00a0 be communicated to the defendant sheriff of Albay and\u00a0 to his deputies, as promptly as possible; and<br\/><br\/>\"4.\u00a0 The plaintiff also asks\u00a0 for any other just and equitable remedy and for any other protection of .his rights which may be deemed expedient and adequate to guarantee the same.<br\/><br\/>\"Manila, April 25, 1907.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"CHICOTE &amp; MIRANDA,<br\/> \"By ALFREDO CHICOTE.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"Before me, the undersigned, personally appears Enrique F.

That Antonio de la Riva was the debtor of Rafael Molina y Salvador in the sum of at least 33,659.03.<br\/><br\/>Second. That Enrique F. Somes was a surety on a bond for the payment of the said debt.<br\/><br\/>Third. That as such surety Enrique F. Somes was compelled to pay the said debt between the said Molina\u00a0 and De la Riva.<br\/><br\/>The claim of the plaintiff is that, by virtue of having paid the debt of De la Riva to the said Molina, he is entitled to be\u00a0 subrogated to the rights of the\u00a0 said\u00a0 Molina against the said De la Riva, and to support this claim the plaintiff calls our attention to the provisions of Section II of Chapter II of Title XIV of the Civil Code, and especially to article 1839 of said Section II.\u00a0 Article 1839 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"By virtue of such payment (by the surety) the surety is subrogated\u00a0 in\u00a0 all\u00a0 the rights which\u00a0 the creditor\u00a0 had against the debtor.\"<\/blockquote>The doctrine established by this article and the one contended for by the plaintiff is not new.\u00a0 It\u00a0 has been thoroughly established for centuries in both the civil and the common law.\u00a0 It has been the subject of discussion by the courts and eminent law writers for\u00a0 many years and so far as we have been able to find the doctrine has never been doubted or denied.\u00a0 In the present case the attorney for the defendant, in the argument of the cause before the court, admitted that a surety who paid the debt of his principal was entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor, but denied that the facts in the present complaint were\u00a0 sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to be subrogated in the present action.<br\/><br\/>The law is well established that a surety is entitled to every remedy which the creditor has against the principal debtor, to enforce every security and all means of payment; to stand in the place of the creditor, not only through the medium of the contract but even by means of the securities entered into without the knowledge of the surety; having a right to have those securities transferred to him,.though there was no stipulation for it, and to avail himself of all securities against\u00a0 the debtor.\u00a0 (Hampton <i>vs<\/i>. Levy, 1 McCord\u00a0 Eq., 107.)<br\/><br\/>As regards the rights of a surety against his principal, lie is plainly entitled to expect, not only that the principal shall save him from harm by exempting him from payment of the debt, or, if that is not done, by reimbursing him when\u00a0 he has paid it, but, moreover, that the principal shall allow him the benefit of the means of payment which he has placed in the hands or within the power of the creditor. (Johnson <i>vs.<\/i> Young, 20 W. Va., 014.)<br\/><br\/>The right of subrogation is not a contractual right.\u00a0 The right of a surety who ha.s paid a debt to subrogation stands, not upon contract but\u00a0 upon the principles of natural justice.\u00a0 (Craythorne <i>vs.<\/i> Sweinburn, 14 Vesey Jr., Common Law Reports, 160; Hayes <i>vs.<\/i> Ward, 4 Johnson, Chancery X. Y.,\u00a0 123.)<br\/><br\/>In this latter case Chancellor Kent in discussing this question said, in effect, that a surety who pays the debt is entitled to be substituted in the place of the creditor as to all the security or means possessed by the creditor, to enforce payment of the principal debtor.<br\/><br\/>Lord Chief Justice Eyre, in the case of\u00a0 Deering; <i>vs.<\/i> Winchelsea (2 Bos. and P., 270) said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The obligation of sureties is not founded in contract but stands upon a principle of equity.\"<\/blockquote>The whole doctrine of subrogation as to principal and surety is raised upon the established principles of equity and not upon contract, except as it may be represented to be made with the implied knowledge\u00a0 of the existence of those principles.<br\/><br\/>The doctrine of subrogation is enforced solely for the purpose of accomplishing the ends of substantial justice and independent of any contractual relation between the parties.\u00a0 (Memphis, etc., Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Dow, 120 U. S., 287.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of Furnold <i>vs.<\/i> Bank of State\u00a0 (44 Mo., 336) the supreme court of Missouri said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The practice of subrogation or substitution or cession of remedies is borrowed from the civil law, and, under the guidance of Chancellor\u00a0 Kent, has\u00a0 gone further in\u00a0 this country than in England.\u00a0 It is a creation\u00a0 of equity and is administered\u00a0 so as to\u00a0 secure real and essential justice, without regard to form.\"<\/blockquote>(See also Prairie State National Bank <i>vs.<\/i> U. S., 164 U. 8., 227; Moore <i>vs.<\/i> Topliff, 107 111., 241.)<br\/><br\/>Bispham, in his excellent work on the Principles of Equity, in section 336,\u00a0 says :<br\/><blockquote>\"This equity of subrogation rs one eminently calculated to do\u00a0 exact justice between persons who are hound for the performance of\u00a0 the same duty or obligation, and is\u00a0 one, therefore, which is much encouraged and protected.\u00a0 This may be seen from the rule which allows the surety to keep alive a judgment for the purpose of obtaining satisfaction out of the\u00a0 principal.\u00a0 Ordinarily\u00a0 the payment of a debt operates as its extinguishment and the payment of a judgment\u00a0 obtained for a\u00a0 debt would necessarily extinguish it. To apply this rule to the case of a surety paying the debt would obviously work injustice in many instances; for, coming in as a simple-contract creditor, the surety might lose his chance of reimbursement.\u00a0 It\u00a0 has, accordingly, been held, and must be considered to be the generally received doctrine, that a surety, who pays a debt which has been reduced to a judgment, is entitled to have the judgment kept alive for his benefit, and to enjoy, as against the principal debtor, exactly the same advantages which could have been claimed by the judgment creditor.\"<\/blockquote>Sheldon, in his valuable work on Subrogation, at section 11 says:<br\/><blockquote>\"*\u00a0 *\u00a0 * The doctrine of subrogation is that one\u00a0 who has been compelled to pay a debt which ought to have been paid by another is entitled to exercise all the remedies which\u00a0 the creditor possessed against that other, and to indemnity from the fund out of which should have been made the payment which he has made. *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * It is a mode which equity adopts to compel the ultimate discharge of debt by him who\u00a0 in equity and good conscience ought to pay it, and to relieve\u00a0 him whom only a creditor would ask to pay.\u00a0 Although, as between the debtor and creditor, the debt may be extinguished, yet, as between the person who has paid the debt and the other parties, the\u00a0 debt is kept alive,so far as may be necessary to preserve\u00a0 the securities.\"<\/blockquote>See also Arnold <i>vs.<\/i> Green (116 N. Y., 566), where Judge Vann made\u00a0 the following observation (p. 571) :<br\/><blockquote>\"The remedy of subrogation is no longer limited to securities and <i>quasi <\/i>securities, but includes so wide a range of subjects that it has been called the 'mode which equity adopts to compel the ultimate payment of a debt by the one who in justice, equity, and good conscience ought to pay it.'\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Smith <i>vs.<\/i> National Surety Company, the supreme court of the State of New York\u00a0 held that a surety on appeal, who\u00a0 has\u00a0 been compelled\u00a0 to pay a\u00a0 judgment, against several defendants, is entitled to be subrogated to the plaintiff's\u00a0 rights, under a contract with one of them, made pending the appeal, without the surety's knowledge or consent, binding the said defendant to pay part of\u00a0 the judgment on\u00a0 the condition of\u00a0 his release\u00a0 therefrom. Where the surety on appeal has been obliged to pay plaintiff's judgment, the latter can\u00a0 not\u00a0 question\u00a0 the\u00a0 surety's right to be subrogated to plaintiff's right, under the judgment or any security held against\u00a0 said\u00a0 defendant.\u00a0 (93 N. Y. Supreme Court Reports;\u00a0 see also 59\u00a0 N. Y.\u00a0 Supplement, 789.)<br\/><br\/>The surety who pays a\u00a0 judgment after it has been affirmed on appeal will be subrogated to the rights of the judgment creditor against the lands of the principal in the hands of one who purchased from the principal, pending the appeal, and will have priority over the assignee of a mortgage given by such purchaser to secure the purchase money.\u00a0 (Hill <i>vs.<\/i> King, 48 Ohio State, 75.)<br\/><br\/>The foregoing doctrine of subrogation is also well established under Spanish jurisprudence.\u00a0 In\u00a0 the\u00a0 sentence\u00a0 of the supreme court of Spain of the 23d of September, 1805, that court laid down the following doctrine:<br\/><blockquote>\"Credits may\u00a0 be transferred by sale,\u00a0 by cession in payment, or by any of the other methods\u00a0 recognized\u00a0 by the law, without the knowledge of the debtor and even against his\u00a0 will, inasmuch\u00a0 as the grantor and the grantee\u00a0 only intervene in the contract, and the grantee being subrogated to the former by virtue of the cession,\u00a0 all the rights and actions belonging to said grantor are transferred to him with respect to the credit and\u00a0 the bonds and pledges.\"<\/blockquote>This doctrine of subrogation in no way can be prejudicial to the rights of subsequent creditors.\u00a0 It simply\u00a0 substitutes the surety of\u00a0 the debtor for that of the creditor and\u00a0 the property which the creditor might have used in the liquidation of his debt is given for the liquidation of the debt transferred by subrogation to the surety.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion and so\u00a0 hold that the facts stated in the complaint show that the plaintiff herein was the surety of the debtor, De la Riva, and had paid the said. debt as such surety, and is therefore entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the defendant, the said\u00a0 Molina. The judgment of the lower court is therefore hereby reversed, without costs to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>After the expiration of ten\u00a0 days let a judgment be entered in accordance herewith,\u00a0 and after the expiration\u00a0 of twenty days let the record herein be returned to the lower court with permission to the defendants to file an answer to the complaint in said cause, within a period of ten days thereafter.\u00a0 If, however, within the period of ten days the defendants do not present an\u00a0 answer in said cause, it\u00a0 is hereby ordered\u00a0 that the lower court render a final judgment, reversing\u00a0 its former judgment and ordering that the plaintiff\u00a0 herein\u00a0 be subrogated to the rights of\u00a0 the said Molina in the judgment in\u00a0 cause No. 2721 of this court, corresponding to cause No.\u00a0 3402 of the court below.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

We can not accept as the full equivalent of proof on oath the agreement of counsel that, if certain additional witnesses were produced and sworn on behalf of the prosecution as well as of the defense,\u00a0 they would testify as the actual witnesses had done as to the very substance of the issue.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Donato, 9 Phil. Rep., 701.)\u00a0 It is not supposed to be within the knowledge or competence of counsel to predict what a proposed witness shall say when under the sanction of his oath and the test of cross-examination.\u00a0 A conviction for crime should not rest upon such mere conjecture.\u00a0 Nor is it possible for a trial court to weigh with exact nicety the contradictory declarations of witnesses not produced so as to be subjected to its observation and its judgment as to their credibility. This class of testimony was unfavorably\u00a0 commented upon\u00a0 in United States <i>vs.<\/i> Pobre,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> decided August 1, 1908.\u00a0 In the case of the United\u00a0 States <i>vs.<\/i> Castaneda (reported\u00a0 in memorandum, 10 Phil.

Judgment of the court below hi favor of the defendants reversed and defendants ordered to yield possession to plaintiff and to reimburse him for losses. New trial ordered for the purpose of fixing the damages only.<br\/><br\/><i>Per Mapa, J.<\/i><br\/><br\/>For appellant: Vicente Foz.<br\/>For appellees: Trineo Javier.<br\/><br\/><div align=\"center\"><b>D E C I S I O N<br\/><\/b><\/div><br\/>Alegase en la demanda que el demandante es due\u00f1o de una partida de terreno que ubica en el sitio de Tamdagan, municipio de Dingras, provincia de Ilocos Norte y linda al Norte con terrenos de Pedro Hernando y Andres Guerrero, al Sur con bosque y terreno de Florentino Laureta y Dionisio Laureta, al Este con el mismo Dionisio Laureta, y al Oeste con otros terrenos del demandante; que es ademas due\u00f1o de una zanja con su correspondiente presa que recibiendo el aguq del rio Gasgas o Tamdagan riega en toda su extension el terreno que se acaba de describir y otros terrenos que el demandante posee en el mismo sitio; que en Junio de 1903 el demandado Florantino Laureta se apodero por si y ante si del mencianado terreno sembrandolo de palay en aquel a\u00f1o y el siguiente o sea en 1904; que en Julio del mismo a\u00f1o 1903 el propio Florentino Laureta y sus co-demandados Dionisio Laureta y Domingo Guillermo se apoderaron de las referidas zanja y presa cerrando la zanja y dos brazos peque\u00f1os que tenia con piedras y tierra, impidieno asi que corran sus aguas a las otras propiedades que tiene el demandante en el mencionado sitio de Tamdagan.<br\/><br\/>Alega tambien el demandante que el terreno arriba descrito, usurpado por Florencio Laureta, produce anualmente diez y seis uyones de palay, cuyo producto ha dejado el de percibir durante los a\u00f1os 1903 y 1904 con motivo de dichausurpacion: que a consecuencia igualmente de la usurpacion y cierre de la zanja quedaron privadas de agua sus otras sementeras contiguas a la misma, por cuyo motivo se murieron la siembras de palay que tenia hechas en ellas el a\u00f1os 1903 y no pudo sembrarlas en 1904.\u00a0 Segun el demandante los perjuicios que se le han ocasionada por este concepto consisten en cien uyones de palay, a razon de cincuenta uyones que debia percibir en cada a\u00f1o.<br\/><br\/>Fundado en estos hechos pide el demandante: 1.o que se condene al demandado Florentino Laureta, a que restituya el terreno por el usurpado y a la indemnizacion de diez y seis uyones de palay, o su importe total de 160 pesos a razon de diez pesos el uyon; y 2.o que se condene ademas al mismo Florentino Laureta y a sus co-demandados Dionisio Laureta y Domingo Guillermo a que dejan libres y expeditas a su disposicion la zanja y presa arriba mencionadas y la indemnizen los da\u00f1os y perjuicios causados con la usuparcion de las mismas, consistentes en cien uyones de palay que importan mil pesos en junto.<br\/><br\/>En su contestacion hacen los demandados una negacion general de los hechos consignado en la demanda, alegando a su vez que son due\u00f1os de las zanjas y presa objeto de la cuestion por haberlas construido el Florintino Laureta en union de seis hermanos suyos el a\u00f1o 1863; y que el terreno que se reclama en la demanda es tambien de la propiedad del mismo Florentino Laureta por haherlo roturado hace mas de veinte a\u00f1os.<br\/><br\/>En vista de las pruebas aducidas por una y otra parte el Juzgado fallo el asunto en favor de los demandados absolviendoles de la demanda, sin hacer expresa condenacion de las costas del juicio.<br\/><br\/>El demandante presento varios documentos publicos casi todos, para justificar su derecho de propiedad sobre el terreno cuestionado.\u00a0 Esos documentos acreditan varias adquisiciones hechas por el demandante de diferentes parcelas de terrenos ubicados en el sitio de Tamdagan.\u00a0 Estas parcelas, dicese en el alegato del demandante, se hallan cada una a continuacion de la otra, formando entre todas una sola porcion que es la dise\u00f1ada en el croquis exhibit A de decho demandante presentado, sin objecion de los demandados, para la identificacion del terreno litigioso.\u00a0 Teniendo en cuenta los linderos expresados en cada documento creemos que esta afirmacion es exacta, maxime porque los demandados no han demostrado ni intentado siguiera demostrar lo contrario.<br\/><br\/>La propiedad del demandante resulta ademas corroborada por el testimonio de cuatro testigos que afirman ser aquel el due\u00f1o del terreno en cuestion.\u00a0 Esos testigos han sido inquilinos del demandante y han cultivado como tales dicho terreno durante varois a\u00f1os hasta que fue usurpado por el demandado Florentino Laureta en Junio de 1903.\u00a0 Su testimonio es por esta razon de gran peso en el juicio.\u00a0 Esos mismos testigos declaran haber presenciado el acto del apoderamiento del terreno llevado a cabo por dicho demandado.<br\/><br\/>Al declarar este como testigo en el juicio dijo que viene poseyendo dicho terreno hace mas de cuarenta y cinco a\u00f1os, y que le fue concedida la propiedad del mismo por el Gobierno de su provincia el a\u00f1o 1970.\u00a0 El titulo de esa concesion ha sido presentado como prueba por el demandado; pero es lo cierto que no se refiere a terreno alguno situado en Tamdagan, sino a terrenos que radican en Mariquet, Natayag y Lipay.\u00a0 Tanto la prueba documental como la testifical apoyan claramente la pretension del demandate sobre la propiedad del terrano en cuestion.<br\/><br\/>Otro tanto debe decirse con respecto a la zanja y presa mencionadas en la demanda.\u00a0 Esa zanja, segun se ve en el croquiz ya citad arriba, sirve para denominado Mariquet, pertencientes a diferentes due\u00f1os.\u00a0 Parte de esos terrenos son indudablemente del demandante, como indudable es tambien que el demandado posee alguna parcela en Mariquet.\u00a0 Para llegar a este ultimo punto tiene que pasar la zanja primeramente por los terrenos del demandante.\u00a0 Hay pruebas de que la zanja en la parte que corresponde a los terrenos del demandante ha sido construida por Adriano Mata y Plicarpo Nery.\u00a0 Esas pruebas las constituyen el testimonio de los ya mencionados testigos del demandante y el documento exhibit B.\u00a0 del mismo demandante que es un titulo de concesion y adjudicacion de dichas presa y zanja hecha por la autoridad gubernativa de la provincia en favor de Mata y Nery en 1970.\u00a0 El mismo demandado Dionisio Laureta no ha podido menos de reconcer, al declarar como testigo en el juicio, que los referidos Adriano Mata y Policarpo Nery construyeron una zanja en el sitio de Tamdagan, si bien dice que no la terminaron.\u00a0 El demandante compro la zanja y presa regar no solo el terreno usurpado por Florentino Laureta, sino tambien los otros que posee en las proximidades de dicha zanja hasta que los demandados cerraron su comunicacion con los dichos terrenos del demandante, privandolos de los beneficios del riego, en Julio de 1903.\u00a0 Consta probado esto por la declaracion de los cuatro testigo del demandante; quienes aseverandemas que los terrenos de este que han quedado improductivos por falta del riego, pueden producir anualmente setenta uyones, 3\u00b0 de su demanda, aprecia solo en la mited del producto anual de dichas terrenos la cuantia de los perjuicios efectivos que ha sufrido con motivo de la usurpacion de la zanja.\u00a0 Esos perjuicios deben ser indemnizados por los demandados al demandante.<br\/><br\/>No hay datos en el juicio para poder apreciar exactmente el valor de cada uyon de palay.\u00a0 La demanda dice que un uyon vale diez pesos, pero en el alegato del mismo demendante se expresa que vale solo cinco.\u00a0 De todos modos no existe ninguna prueba sobre este particular, y ello debe ser objeto de nuevo juicio.<br\/><br\/>Con revocacion de la sentencia apelada, se condena al demandado Florention Laureta a restituir al demandante el terreno objeto de la cuestion y a indemnizarle el importe de los productos que ha dejado de percibir de dicho terreno a razon de siete uyones de palay al a\u00f1o, a contar desde 1903 inclusive hasta que se verifique de hecho la restitucion.\u00a0 Se condena asimismo a dicho Florentino Laureta y a sus co-demandados Dionisio Laureta y Domingo Guillermo a que repongan la zanja y presa cuestionadas al ser y estado que tenian al efectuarse la usurpacion de las mismas, dejando libre y expedito el uso de ellas al demandante, y a la indemnizacion a este de los perjuicios ocasionados al mismo con motivo de dicha usurpacion consistentes en el importe de treinta y cinco uyones de palay por cada uno de los a\u00f1os trascurridos y que trascurran desde 1903 inclusice hasta que se verifique ducha reposicion.\u00a0 Y se ordena la celebracion de nuevo juicio para el solo y unico objeto de determinar el valor de cada uyon de palay que deben satisfacer los demandados al demandante.\u00a0 No se hace expresa condenacion de costas de esta instancia.\u00a0 Trascurridos veintes dias desde la notificacion de esta decision, dictese sentencia a tenor de lo reuelto y diez dias despues, devuelvanse los autos al Juzgado de su procendencia para los efectos que en derecho hubiere lugar.<br\/><br\/>Asi se ordena.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.J., Gomez.

Hunter made a contract in which it was\u00a0 provided, among other things, that certain rent for July,\u00a0 August, September, and October, due to\u00a0 the plaintiffs from\u00a0 Miss Hunter for the occupation of a certain building belonging to them, might be paid as follows: P850 within the first three days of October, 1904; P850 within the first three days of November, 1904; and the balance of P700 to be paid within the first three days of December, 1904.\u00a0 The effect of the agreement was to extend the time for the payment of these sums, as\u00a0 indicated therein.\u00a0 The contract contained the following clause:<br\/><blockquote>\"5. I also further agree that the failure of said Miss A. Hunter to faithfully execute the agreements hereinbefore guaranteed by me will render my liability at once fixed and absolute, and that said Hubert &amp; Guamis may immediately\u00a0 proceed\u00a0 against me to enforce\u00a0 the same without first proceeding against said Miss A. Hunter.\"<\/blockquote>This action was brought against Smith alone to recover the P850 payable within the first three days of November, 1904, and the P700 payable within the first three days of December.<br\/><br\/>The defendant alleged in his answer that Miss Hunter had paid the P850 due within the first three days of November, 1904; that when he signed the contract, she gave him security to protect him against loss thereon; that on the second day of November Miss Hunter showed him a receipt signed by the plaintiffs to the effect that she had paid the rent for the month of November, and that he, believing that all the rent for the property had been paid, surrendered to her the security which she had given him.<br\/><br\/>Judgment was rendered in the court below in favor of the plaintiffs and the defendant has appealed.<br\/><br\/>There was nothing in the case to show\u00a0 that the P850 payable within the first three days of November on account of the\u00a0 rent for July, August, September, and October had been paid, except a receipt, dated on the second day of November, 1904, by the plaintiffs for the rent for the month of November,\u00a0 The defendant relies upon article 1110 of the Civil Code, which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A receipt from the creditor for the principal, without any stipulation regarding interest, extinguishes the obligation of the debtor with regard\u00a0 thereto.<br\/><br\/>\"The receipt for the last installment of a debt, when the creditor has made no reservation, shall also extinguish the obligation with regard to the previous installments.\"<\/blockquote>We can not see how this article could in any event have any application to this case, or prove the payment of the rent for the months of July, August, September, and October, because the time for the payment of a part of that rent had been extended, and the amount sued for here was not due\u00a0 on the second day of November, when the receipt in question was signed.\u00a0 The obligation to pay that rent was not\u00a0 based entirely upon the contract of lease, but was based\u00a0 upon a subsequent agreement, namely, the agreement of September 12, 1904.\u00a0 Moreover,\u00a0 the provision of law applicable to the case is not article 1110 of the\u00a0 Civil Code, but is section 334, paragraph 9, of the Code of\u00a0 Civil Procedure, which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The following presumptions are satisfactory, if uncontradicted, but they are disputable, and may be contradicted by other evidence:<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"9. That former rent or installments had been paid when a receipt for the later ones is produced.\"<\/blockquote>On the defendant's theory, this case falls exactly within the provisions of the section last cited, by the terms of which the receipt in question was only <i>prima facie<\/i> evidence of the payment of the rent.\u00a0 In the case of Perez <i>vs.<\/i> Garcia (7 Phil.

One half of any fine so imposed shall be for the use of the Insular Government, and the other half for the use of the informer, who shall be ascertained and stated in the judgment of the court.\"<\/blockquote>The Internal Revenue Law was enacted long after the Penal Code was promulgated in these Islands, and the state of facts charged and proven in this case furnish an instance wherein the new law has provided a penalty for acts committed under certain conditions altogether different from the penalty prescribed for the same acts committed under the same conditions under the old law. In such cases it is evident that the new law must be taken to repeal the old law, and this notwithstanding the fact that there is no express repealing clause in the new law. It was clearly and unmistakably the intention of the legislator that in any case where one is charged with the commission of the acts penalized in section 24 of the Internal Revenue Act, and the commission of those acts is proven at the trial, the penalty to be imposed should be the penalty prescribed in that section.<br\/><br\/>It is true that repeals of penal statutes by implication are not favored, and if the statutes can stand together consistently, the later statute should not be construed as repealing the earlier one, but in penal as well as other statutes repeal by implication necessarily results in any case of repugnancy or essential inconsistency between two successive statutes or in any case where the intention of the legislator is manifest that a later statute should su\u00adpersede an earlier one. It can not be doubted that where a later statute provides a punishment in a different degree from the punishment provided in an earlier statute for the doing or omitting to do a certain act, the legislator thereby clearly manifests his intention that at least, so far as the later statute is inconsistent with the former statute, it shall be deemed to repeal such former statute by implication.

Y., 152.)<br\/><br\/>We are of opinion, therefore, that article 534 of the Penal Code, which defines and penalizes <i>estafa<\/i>, has been repealed in so far as it undertakes to prescribe penalties for those acts which constitute a violation of the Internal Revenue Law, as defined and penalized in section 24 of Act No.1189.<br\/><br\/>The sentence imposed by the trial court in this case for <i>estafa<\/i> must be reversed, and a violation of the Internal Revenue Law having been clearly charged in the information, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt, we should and do find the accused guilty of this latter offense and sentence him to six months' imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of the above-cited section 24 of the Internal Revenue Act, and to the payment of the costs in both instances.<br\/><br\/>It has been suggested that in thus imposing an increased penalty on conviction, on the same facts, of the commission of a distinct offense, other than that of which the accused was convicted in the court below, this court disregards the right of the accused not to be placed twice in jeopardy within the meaning of the Philippine Bill of Rights.<br\/><br\/>It has been held, however, that \"an accused is not placed twice in jeopardy for the same offense within the meaning of the act of July 1, 1902, section 5, because the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, upon reversing judgment below in a criminal case, on an appeal taken by the accused, convicted him, on the same facts, of a different offense, carrying an increased sentence.\" (Trono <i>vs.<\/i> United States, 199 U.

That Donato Lelis, her husband, died in 1883, leaving a will under which she was named as the only heir, and that she had been in possession of the property of her husband as such heir since the death of her husband.<br\/><br\/>Second. That Donato Lelis brought no property to the marital relation, and that all of the property left by her husband was <i>bienes ganandales<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Third. That the defendant had paid the debts of the estate of Donato Lelis, which amounted to more than the value of the property left by her husband.<br\/><br\/>To this answer of the defendant the plaintiff filed a demurrer, maintaining that the answer of the defendant did not constitute a defense to the cause of action of the plaintiff. The court overruled this demurrer and the defendant duly excepted.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the judge of the lower court reached the following conclusions upon the questions presented:<br\/><br\/>First. That Donato Lelis had no authority under the law in force at that time by will to leave all of his property to his wife to the exclusion of <i>herederos forzosos,<\/i> citing in support of this contention law 10, title 7, part. 6\u00a0 (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">a<\/span>); law 1 (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">a<\/span>), title 8 (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">o<\/span>), part. 6 (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">a<\/span>); Escriche, <i>Diccionario Razonado de Legislation y Jurisprudencia,<\/i> vol. 4, page 638.<br\/><br\/>Second. That, by reason of the fact that Donato Lelis had no authority under the law to so dispose of his property, his will was null and void, citing in support of this conclusion the authorities above and in addition thereto Escriche,<i> Diccionario,<\/i> etc., pages 299 and 1101.<br\/><br\/>Third. That the mere fact that the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">herederos forzosos<\/span> had not appeared at the time of the probation of the will, did not have the effect of depriving them of the right to insist upon their portion of the inheritance, under the law, within the period prescribed by law, citing in support of this conclusion decisions of the supreme court of Spain of the 26th of September, 1876, the 29th of September, 1877, and also law 18, title 6, part. 6 (<i>a<\/i>), and law 101, title 18, part. 3 (<i>a<\/i>).<br\/><br\/>The lower court further held that the order of the court made at the time of the probation of the will to the effect that the defendant under said will became the owner of all of the property left by her husband, Donato Lelis, did not have the effect of giving her the sole right to the property as against the <i>herederos forzosos.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Fourth. The lower court held that the period of prescription applicable to actions by omitted heirs is thirty years, citing in support of this conclusion Law 63 of Toro, decisions of the supreme court of Spain of November 17, 1865, December 12, 1865, December 30, 1865, 6 Manresa, 325, and 7 Manresa, 403.<br\/><br\/>Fifth. That the defendant had paid the debts of the estate of Donato Lelis, which debts exceeded the value of the property and that, therefore, the defendant was entitled to said property left by her husband.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing conclusions of the lower court the plaintiff appealed and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"I. The court erred in overruling the demurrer presented by the plaintiffs to the answer of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>\"II. The court erred in admitting as evidence the letters marked Exhibit D.<br\/><br\/>\"III. The court erred in admitting as evidence the receipts marked Exhibit C for payments made by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>\"IV. The court erred in admitting as evidence the document Exhibit K.<br\/><br\/>\"V. The court erred in admitting as evidence the document Exhibit R.<br\/><br\/>\"VI. The court erred in declaring in the judgment that the defendant assumed the payment of the debts of Donato Lelis, deceased, which together with the cost of the last illness and the funeral expenses amounted to more than the value of all the property belonging to the husband and wife at the time of the death of Donato Lelis.<br\/><br\/>\"VII. The court erred in holding that the defendant, having paid said debts, is entitled to the reimbursement therefor out of the property of her late husband, and that, after the delivery to her of sufficient property to reimburse the expenditure made by her, there is nothing to be divided between the heirs of Donato Lelis, deceased.<br\/><br\/>\"VIII. The court erred in disregarding the hereditary right of the plaintiff, Barbara Lelis, as the sole heir of her parents.<br\/><br\/>\"IX. The court erred in overruling the motion for a new trial.\"<\/blockquote>During the trial of the cause the defendant undertook to show that she had paid some thousands of pesos of indebtedness against the estate of her deceased husband and alleged that these debts exceeded the value of the property. No satisfactory proof was adduced during the trial showing what was the value of the property in question at the time of the death of Donato Lelis.<br\/><br\/>Upon a full consideration of the assignments of error made by the plaintiff and of the record brought to this court, we have1 reached the following conclusions:<br\/><br\/>First. That the property left by Donato Lelis, a part of which the plaintiff is attempting to recover, was not <i>bienes gananciales.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Second. That under his<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> las<\/span> <i>Leyes de Toro<\/i>, under the circumstances presented in this case, Donato Lelis could not by will deprive the plaintiffs herein as <i>herederos forzosos<\/i>of their interest in the property which he had at the time of his death, without giving some special reason therefor. (Law 6 of Toro, 1 (<i>a<\/i>), title 8 (<i>o<\/i>), part. 6 (<i>a<\/i>) ; Emilio Escuin y Itatac <i>vs.<\/i> Francisco Escuin,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 6 Off. Gaz., 1537).<br\/><br\/>Third. That the plaintiffs herein under <i>las Leyes de Toro<\/i> and under the facts in the present case are entitled to two-thirds of the estate of the said Donato Lelis, they being <i>herederos forzosos,<\/i> and the defendant is entitled to one- third interest in the said estate. (Law 6\u00a0 Toro, 6 <i>Los Codigos Espa\u00f1oles,<\/i> 573).<br\/><br\/>Fourth. That, when the <i>herederos forzosos<\/i> accept the property of an estate, under <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">las<\/span> <i>Leyes de Toro<\/i>, to which they are entitled under the law, they thereby become obligated to pay the debts against the estate, at least to the extent of the value of the property so accepted. (Law 1 (<i>a<\/i>), title 8 (<i>o<\/i>), part. 6 (<i>a<\/i>).)<br\/><br\/>Fifth. That if one of the<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> herederos forzosos<\/span> should pay the debts of the estate, he is entitled to be repaid out of the estate the amount of the indebtedness which he pays.<br\/><br\/>Sixth. The plaintiffs, therefore, in the present case, before they can recover their interest in the estate under the law, must pay to the defendant their proportional share of the indebtedness against said estate.<br\/><br\/>Seventh. That the law of prescription applicable to actions like the present one is <i>Ley 63 de Tora<\/i>. (6 Manresa, 325; 7 Manresa, 1008; decisions of supreme court of Spain of November 17, 1865, December 12, 1865, December 30, 1867.)<br\/><br\/>In view of the fact that the record does not positively disclose\u2014<br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>) That all of the indebtedness paid by the defendant was indebtedness against the estate of Donato Lelis;<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>) That such indebtedness was in fact more than the value of the property of the said Donato Lelis; and<br\/><br\/>In view of the fact that the record does not disclose the value of the property of the said estate at the time of the death of Donato Lelis; and<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing considerations of fact and law, it is hereby ordered that the cause be remanded to the lower court for the purpose of a new trial for the purpose of taking additional evidence upon the following questions:<br\/><br\/>(1) What was the total amount of indebtedness existing against the estate of Donato Lelis at the time of his death;<br\/><br\/>(2)\u00a0 What was the total amount of such indebtedness paid by the defendant, Trinidad Bautista; and<br\/><br\/>(3) What was the value of the property of Donato Lelis at the time of his death.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the additional testimony upon these questions, the lower court is directed to render a decision in accordance with the foregoing conclusions of law.

HIGINO MENESES, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT. <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\"> On the 14th of March, 1904, Nicolas Lunod, Juan de la Vega, Evaristo Rodriguez, Fernando Marcelo, Esteban Villena, Benito\u00a0 Litao, Ventura Hernandez,\u00a0 and Casimiro Pantanilla, residents of the town of Bulacan, province of the same name, filed a written complaint\u00a0 against Higino Meneses, alleging that they each owned and possessed farm lands situated in the places known as May tunas and\u00a0 Balot, near a small lake named\u00a0 Calalaran;\u00a0 that the defendant is the owner of a fish-pond and a strip of land situated in Paraanan, adjoining the said lake on one side, and the River\u00a0 Taliptip\u00a0 on the other; that from time immemorial, and consequently for more than twenty years before 1901, there existed and still exists in favor of the rice fields of the plaintiffs a statutory easement permitting the flow of water\u00a0 over the said land in Paraanan, which easemenl the said plaintiffs enjoyed until the year 1901 and consisted in that the water collected upon their lands and in\u00a0 the Calalaran Lake could flow through Paraanan into the Taliptip River.\u00a0 From that year\u00a0 however,\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant, without any right or reason,\u00a0 converted the land in Paraanan into a fish pond and by means of a dam and a bamboo net, prevented the' free passage\u00a0 of\u00a0 the water through said place into the Taliptip Kiver; that in\u00a0 consequence the lands of the plaintiff\u00a0 became flooded\u00a0 and damaged by the stagnant waters,\u00a0 there\u00a0 being no outlet except\u00a0 through the land in Paraanan; that their plantations were destroyed, causing them\u00a0 loss and\u00a0 damage to the extent of about Pl,000, which loss and damage\u00a0 will continue if the obstructions to the flow of the water are allowed to remain,\u00a0 preventing its passage through\u00a0 said land and injuring the\u00a0 rice plantations of\u00a0 the plaintiffs. They therefore asked that judgment be\u00a0 entered against the defendant, declaring that the\u00a0 said tract of land in Paraanan is subject to a statutory easement\u00a0 permitting the flow of water from the property of the plaintiffs,\u00a0 and that, without prejudice to the issuing of a preliminary injunction, the defendant be\u00a0 ordered to remove and destroy the\u00a0 obstructions\u00a0 that impede\u00a0 the\u00a0 passage of\u00a0 the waters\u00a0 through Paraanan, and that in future,\u00a0 and for ever he abstain from closing in any manner the aforesaid tract of land; that, upon judgment being entered, the said injunction be declared to be final and that\u00a0 the defendant be\u00a0 sentenced to pay to the plaintiffs an\u00a0 indemnity of P1,000, and the costs\u00a0 in the proceedings; that they be granted any other and further equitable or proper remedy in accordance with the\u00a0 facts alleged and proven.<br\/><br\/>In view of the demurrer interposed by the plaintiffs to the answer of the defendant, the latter, on the 29th of August, 1904, filed an amended answer, denying each and every one of the allegations of the complaint, and alleged that no statutory easement existed nor could exist in favor of the lands described in the complaint, permitting\u00a0 the waters to flow over the fish pond that\u00a0 he, together with his brothers, owned in the sitio of Bambang, the area and boundaries of which\u00a0 were\u00a0 stated by him, and which he and his brothers had inherited from their deceased mother, Apolinaria de Leon; that the same had been surveyed by a land surveyor in September, 1881; he also denied that he had occupied or converted any land in the barrio of Bambang into\u00a0 a fish pond; therefore, he asked the court to enter judgment in his favor, and to sentence the.plaintiffs to pay the costs and corresponding damages.<br\/><br\/>Upon the evidence adduced by both parties to the suit, the court, on the 13th of March, 1907,\u00a0 entered judgment declaring that the plaintiffs were entitled to a decision in their favor, and sentenced the defendant to remove the dam placed to the east of the Paraanan passage on the side of the Taliptip River opposite the old dam in the barrio of Bambang, as well as to remove and destroy the obstacles to the free passage of the waters through the strip of land in Paraanan; to abstain in future, and forever, from obstructing or closing in any manner the course of the waters through the said strip of land.\u00a0 The request that the defendant be sentenced to pay an indemnity was denied, and no ruling was made as to costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendant excepted to the above judgment and furthermore asked for a new trial which was denied and also excepted to, and, upon approval of the bill of exceptions, the question was\u00a0 submitted to this\u00a0 court.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the defendant's denial in his amended answer, it appears to have been clearly proven in this case that the lands owned by the plaintiffs in the aforesaid barrio, as well as the small adjoining lake, named Calalaran, are located in places relatively higher than the sitio called Paraanan\u00a0 where\u00a0 the land and\u00a0 fish pond\u00a0 of the defendant are situated, and which border\u00a0 on the Taliptip River; that during the rainy season the rain water which falls on the land of the plaintiffs, and which flows toward the small Calalaran Lake at flood time, has no outlet to the Taliptip River other than through the low land\u00a0 of Paraanan; that on the border line between Calalaran and Paraanan there has existed from time immemorial a dam, constructed by the community\u00a0 for the purpose of preventing the salt waters from the Taliptip River, at high\u00a0 tide, from flooding the land in Calalaran, passing through the lowlands of Paraanan; but, when rainfall was abundant, one of the residents was designated in his turn\u00a0 by the lieutenant or justice of the barrio to open the sluice gate in\u00a0 order to let out the water that flooded the rice fields, through the land of Paraanan to the above-mentioned river; that since 1901, the defendant constructed another dam along the\u00a0 boundary of his fish pond in Paraanan, thereby impeding the outlet of the waters that flood the fields at Calalaran, to the serious detriment of the growing crops.<br\/><br\/>According to article 530 of the Civil Code, an easement is a charge imposed upon one estate for the benefit of another estate belonging to a different owner, and the realty in favor of which the easement is established is called the dominant estate, and the one charged with it the servient estate.<br\/><br\/>The lands of Paraanan being the lower are subject to the easement of receiving and giving passage to the waters proceeding from the higher lands and the lake of Calalaran; this easement was not constituted\u00a0 by agreement between the interested parties; it is of a statutory nature, and the law has imposed it for the common public utility in view of the difference in the altitude of the\u00a0 lands in the barrio of Bambang.<br\/><br\/>Article 552 of the Civil Code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Lower estates must receive the waters which naturally and without the intervention of man descend from the higher estates, as well as the stone or earth which\u00a0 they cairy with them.<br\/><br\/>\"Neither may the owner of the lower estate construct works preventing this easement, nor the one of the higher estate works increasing the burden.\"<\/blockquote>Article 563 of the said code reads also:<br\/><blockquote>\"The establishment, extent, form, and conditions of the easements of waters to which this section refers shall be governed by the special law relating thereto in everything not provided for in this code.\"<\/blockquote>The special law cited is the Law of Waters of August 3,1866, article 111 of which, treating of natural easements relating to waters, provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Lands situated at a lower level are subject to receive the waters that flow naturally, without the work of man, from\u00a0 the\u00a0 higher lands together with the stone or earth which they carry with them.\"<\/blockquote>Hence, the owner of the lower lands can not erect works that will impede or prevent such an easement or charge, constituted and imposed by the law upon his estate for the benefit of the higher lands belonging to different owners; neither can the latter do anything to increase or extend the easement.<br\/><br\/>According to the provisions of law above referred\u00a0 to, the defendant, Meneses, had\u00a0 no right to construct the works, nor the dam which blocks the passage, through his lands and the outlet to the Taliptip River, of the waters which flood the higher lands of the plaintiffs; and having done so, to the detriment of the easement charged on his estate, he has violated the law which protects and guarantees the respective rights and regulates\u00a0 the duties of the owners of the fields in Calalaran and Paraanan.<br\/><br\/>It is true that article 388 of said code authorizes every owner to enclose his estate by means of walls, ditches, fences or any other device, but his right is limited by the easement imposed upon his estate.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Meneses might\u00a0 have constructed the works necessary to make and maintain a fish pond within his own land, but he was always under the strict and necessary' obligation to respect the statutory easement of waters charged upon his property, and had no right to close the passage and outlet of the waters flowing from the lands of the plaintiffs and the lake of Calalaran into the Taliptip\u00a0 River.\u00a0 He could not lawfully injure the owners of the dominant estates by obstructing the outlet to the Taliptip River of the\u00a0 waters flooding\u00a0 the\u00a0 upper lands belonging to the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>It is perhaps useful and advantageous to the plaintiffs and other owners of high lands in Calalaran, in addition to the old dike between the lake of said place and the low lands in Paraanan, to have another made by the defendant at the border of Paraanan adjoining the said river,\u00a0 for the purpose of preventing the salt waters of the Taliptip River flooding, at high tide, not only the lowlands in Paraanan but also the higher ones of Calalaran and its lake, since the plaintiffs can not prevent the defendant from protecting his lands against the influx of salt water; but the defendant could never be permitted to obstruct the flow of the waters through his lands to the Taliptip Eiver during the heavy rains, when the high lands in Calalaran and the lake in said place are flooded, thereby impairing the right of the owners of the dominant estates.<br\/><br\/>For\u00a0 the above reasons, and accepting the findings of the court below in the judgment appealed from\u00a0 in so far as they agree with the terms of this decision, we must and do hereby declare that the defendant, Higino Meneses, as owner of the servient estate, is obliged to give passage to and allow the How of the waters descending from the Calalaran Lake and from the\u00a0 land of the plaintiffs through his lands in Paraanan for their discharge into the Taliptip Eiver; and he is hereby ordered to remove\u00a0 any obstacle that may obstruct the free passage of the waters whenever there may be either a small or large volume of running water through his lands in the sitio of Paraanan for their discharge into the Taliptip River; and in future to abstain from impeding, in any manner, the How of the waters coming from the higher lands.\u00a0 The judgment appealed from is affirmed, in so far as it agrees with this decision, and reversed in other respects, with the\u00a0 costs of this instance\u00a0 against\u00a0 the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Carson, Willard, <\/i> and <i>Tracey, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<\/div>",

W. BROWN.\"<\/div><\/blockquote>In its amended answer,\u00a0 the defendant denied all\u00a0 the allegations of the complaint, denied that it ever executed the instrument in question, alleged that the guaranty was an accommodation one, and set forth two additional defenses as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"5. As a separate and distinct defense, the\u00a0 defendant alleges that the International Banking Corporation can not and could not, during any of the periods mentioned in the complaint, under its charter, enter into an accommodation guaranty nor any such\u00a0 contract of guaranty as referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the said complaint.<br\/><br\/>\"6. As a separate and distinct defense, the defendant alleges that neither R. W. Brown nor any other person or persons, was or were, at any time, authorized by this defendant to enter into such a contract\u00a0 of guaranty as mentioned in the complaint, or into any accommodation guaranty.\"<\/blockquote>This answer was sworn to.\u00a0 At the trial the defendant offered no evidence, and judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff\u00a0 for $8,937,\u00a0 United States currency, with interest from the date of the filing of the complaint, and the costs.\u00a0 From this judgment the defendant has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The first two assignments of error are to the effect that the court below erred in holding that the defendant, by its charter, was authorized to make the guaranty in question, and that that court also erred in holding that R. W. Brown had authority under his power of attorney to execute the document sued upon.\u00a0 The appellee insists that a discussion of these questions is not now open to the\u00a0 appellant, because they have already been passed upon and decided by this court in another action between the same parties, brought upon the same obligation.<br\/><br\/>The decision of this court in the former action is reported in Volume VI, Philippine Reports, page 314.\u00a0 That action was brought to recover the first installment of interest due upon the note in\u00a0 question, although that fact does not appear from the report of the case.\u00a0 In its answer in that case the defendant, after denying generally the allegations of the complaint,\u00a0 set forth the following defenses:<br\/><blockquote>\"Second. That, as a separate and distinct defense, the defendant, the International Banking Corporation, could not and can not, under its charter, enter into the contract of guaranty alleged in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>\"Third. As a second separate and distinct defense, that no agent or officer of the defendant was or is authorized to enter into the contract of guaranty alleged in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>\"Fourth. As a third\u00a0 separate and distinct defense, that 11.\u00a0 W. Brown was not authorized to enter into, on behalf of the International Banking Corporation, defendant, the contract of guaranty alleged in the complaint.\"<\/blockquote>A comparison of that answer with the answer presented in this case shows that the defenses which are the subject of the two assignments of error\u00a0 above mentioned are identical with the defenses presented in the other case.<br\/><br\/>It is not denied by the appellant that if the Court of First Instance and this court had, in the first action, examined the merits of\u00a0 these defenses, and after such an examination decided that the bank did under its charter have authority to make the contract, and that Brown, by virtue of his power\u00a0 of attorney, was authorized to sign it in the name of the bank,\u00a0 the decision in that first case would be conclusive\u00a0 against the appellant in this\u00a0 case,\u00a0 and that it would not\u00a0 here, be allowed to retry the questions decided. But it says that there never was any examination of these defenses upon their merits; that judgment was entered in the first action in the court below in favor of the plaintiff upon\u00a0 the sole ground that the defendant, by failing to year to its answer in that case, had admitted not only the genuineness of the signature of Brown but also his authority to sign the contract in behalf of the defendant and the power of\u00a0 the defendant itself to make such a contract.\u00a0 That this was the basis of the decision\u00a0 in the first case clearly appears from the opinion of this.court, above referred to, and the question is whether or not in such a case anything is conclusively adjudicated.<br\/><br\/>The second suit was not brought upon the same cause of action which was the basis of the first suit.\u00a0 The judgment in the\u00a0 latter\u00a0 is, therefore,\u00a0 not an adjudication\u00a0 of everything that might have been decided in the first suit, but only of that which appears upon\u00a0 its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually or necessarily included therein, or necessary thereto.\u00a0 (Cromwell <i>vs.<\/i> Sac County, 94\u00a0 U. S., 357.)\u00a0 This rule is declared in section 307 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually or necessarily included therein, or necessary thereto.\"<\/blockquote>What, then, was necessarily included in the former judgment?\u00a0 Neither that judgment nor any other judgment could have\u00a0 been rendered against the defendant bank if that bank\u00a0 had no power under its charter to enter into the contract in question, or if Brown, who signed the contract in the name of the defendant, had no authority from the defendant so to do.\u00a0 When the court below, therefore declared that the defendant was responsible for the payment of\u00a0 this\u00a0 debt, it necessarily declared that the bank had, by its charter, authority to make such a contract and that Brown was authorized to sign it in the name of the defendant.\u00a0 The defenses relating to these matters set up both in the answer in the first suit and in the answer in this suit were, therefore, necessarily decided against the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Upon the principal question discussed by the appellant, which relates to the manner in which the court below in the first action arrived at the conclusion that the bank had authority to make this contract, and Brown power to sign it, we consider the case of the\u00a0 Last Chance Mining Company <i>vs.<\/i> Tyler (157 U. S., 683), as a controlling authority against the defendant.\u00a0 The court in that case said, at page 691:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is\u00a0 said that the defendants did not contest; that they withdrew their answer, and that there was\u00a0 only a judgment by default.\u00a0 But a judgment by default is just as conclusive an adjudication between the parties of whatever is essential to support the judgment as one rendered after answer and contest.<br\/><br\/>\"The essence of estoppel by judgment is that there has been a judicial determination of a fact, and the question always is, Has there been such determination? and not upon what evidence or by what means was it reached.\u00a0\u00a0 A failure to answer is taken as an admission of the truth of the facts stated in\u00a0 the complaint, and the court may properly base its determination on such admission.\u00a0 Suppose the defendant flies a denial, and on the trial the only evidence is the testimony of a witness to an admission made by the defendant out of\u00a0 court, and upon such testimony the judgment is rendered.\u00a0 Is it any the less a judicial determination because resting simply upon proof of the defendant's admission, and yet in principle what distinguishes that case\u00a0 from this?\u00a0 In each the judgment\u00a0 is resting upon an admission of the party against whom the judgment is rendered, and does it make any difference\u00a0 in what form that admission is presented to the judge?<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The withdrawal by defendants of their answer may have prevented any judicial determination as to the special facts set up therein in defense or avoidance of plaintiff's claim.\u00a0\u00a0 (Finnegan <i>vs.<\/i> Campbell, 74 Iowa, 158.)\u00a0 But such withdrawal was\u00a0 not operative to take out of the case the complaint\", or the allegations of fact therein contained,\u00a0 or to prevent a judicial determination of those facts.\"<\/blockquote>The appellant in his argument in this court\u00a0 referred\u00a0 to the case\u00a0 of O'Connell <i>vs.<\/i> Mayuga (8 Phil.\u00a0 Rep.,\u00a0 422), claiming it as an authority for the reversal of the judgment. In that case judgment was entered for the defendant.\u00a0 It is seen that a judgment for the defendant may be rendered upon any one of a great number of grounds.\u00a0 In order that such judgment be rendered it is not necessary that any particular fact out of many\u00a0 be determined, but when a judgment is rendered for the plaintiff it is absolutely necessary that the court pass upon and determine such facts as\u00a0 make the defendant legally responsible.\u00a0 In the case of O'Connell <i>vs.<\/i> Mayuga the question was whether Narciso Mayuga had signed\u00a0 the contract in question under the name\u00a0 of Lorenzo Mayuga.\u00a0 No such question was presented\u00a0 in the\u00a0 first action.\u00a0 Narciso Mayuga was not a party to that suit.\u00a0 A summons intended for Lorenzo Mayuga was delivered to him\u00a0 and it is evident that the court in deciding the first suit never took into consideration the question whether Narciso\u00a0 Mayuga and\u00a0 Lorenzo Mayuga might be the same person, for it dismissed the case against Lorenzo Mayuga on the ground that he had never been served with the summons.<br\/><br\/>The third and fourth assignments of error are to the effect that there was no proof of any demand upon the Casa Comision, the principal debtor; no proof that it had not paid, and. no proof of\u00a0 its insolvency.\u00a0 It is true that the only evidence in the case on these points was the presentation at the trial by the plaintiff of the note in question.<br\/><br\/>The guaranty in this case\u00a0 was a guaranty of payment.

Messages received from abroad were not sold in the Philippine Islands, but abroad.\u00a0\u00a0 Messages sent from here abroad, while sold in the Philippine Islands, were not sold for domestic\u00a0 consumption.\u00a0 He further held that outgoing messages must be classed as\u00a0 exports under section 142, above quoted, and that they were, therefore, exempt from taxation.<br\/><br\/>We quite agree with the views thus expressed by the Attorney-General.\u00a0 After the above-mentioned opinion was given,\u00a0 and on July 7, 1905, the Commission amended section 139 by striking therefrom the words \"for domestic consumption.\"\u00a0 (Act No. 1370.)<br\/><br\/>As to the period herein in question, running from the first of January, 1905, to the 7th of July, 1905, the original section 139 must govern, and\u00a0 as\u00a0 to the period\u00a0 from the 7th of July, 1905, to the 30th of January, 1906, the amended section must govern, but in neither case is the company subject to taxation for its foreign business, as indicated in the said opinion.<br\/><br\/>The Attorney General says in his brief in this case that in reality a cable message is not a manufactured article and that nothing material is exported when a foreign message is sent not even\u00a0 the\u00a0 paper on- which it is\u00a0 written. This is true, but it is also true that\u00a0 in reality a cable company is not a manufacturer.\u00a0\u00a0 It makes nothing material. The legislature has, however, declared that\u00a0 for\u00a0 the purposes of the internal-revenue tax law it is a manufacturer. If for the purposes of that law it is a manufacturer, then for the purposes of the same law the articles which it deals\u00a0 in must be manufactured articles and the articles thus manufactured by it, when\u00a0 sent abroad are exported articles within the meaning of section 142.<br\/><br\/>We therefore hold that the company was under no obligation to pay the tax in question upon the sum of P510,250.10, the amount of its receipts for its foreign traffic, and that the tax which was paid by it under protest on that amount must be returned.<br\/><br\/>In determining the question of its liability on account of its receipts for domestic business, it is necessary to consider the terms of the concessions. The articles of the Visayan concession which are material, are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 10. The concessionaire shall\u00a0 enjoy an annual subsidy of four thousand, five hundred pounds sterling, payable monthly in twelve installments, during the whole term of the working of the\u00a0 cables, the said payments being made at\u00a0 Manila by\u00a0 the\u00a0 chief treasury office of those Islands.<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 16. The company holding the concession shall pay the State ten per cent, which tax in its application to cablegrams is fixed after first deducting the amount of the expenses for the maintenance of the stations calculated at six thousand pounds per annum, the said expenses not to exceed the amount specified.<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 18. The tax applicable to telegrams passing over the said cables shall be uniformly fifty centimes of a franc per word, no transit or terminal rate being charged for the telegraphic transmission\u00a0 over the land lines belonging to the Government in the Islands of Panay, Negros, and Cebu.\u00a0 There is a surtax of five centimes\u00a0 of a franc per word on telegrams passing \"between the above-mentioned islands and the\u00a0 others of the Archipelago.\"<\/blockquote>One of the claims of the company is that it is exempt from taxation by the terms of its concessions.\u00a0 The tax imposed by section 139 is not a tax upon property, but upon business\u00a0 or occupation.\u00a0 (Gil Hermanos <i>vs.<\/i> Hord, 10 Phil. Rep., 218.)\u00a0 In the Visayan concession there is no express exemption from taxation.\u00a0 There is, to be sure, the provision in article 16 that the company shall pay the State 10 per cent of its receipts,\u00a0 after deducting 6,000 for expenses, but there is\u00a0 nothing in this article, nor in any other article in the concession, which says that this payment shall\u00a0 be in lieu\u00a0 of all other\u00a0 taxes upon\u00a0 the property.\u00a0 Under such\u00a0 circumstances the Government\u00a0 is not prohibited from levying additional imposts.\u00a0 (Met. St. By. Go. <i>vs.<\/i> New York State Board of Tax Commissioners, 199 U.\u00a0 S., 1.)\u00a0 The part of the decision in that case applicable to the present case is quoted in Casanovas <i>vs.<\/i> Hord (8 Phil. Rep., 125, 132).\u00a0 The fact that under the concession the Spanish\u00a0 Government agreed to pay a subsidy of \u00a34,500 per annum would not, in view of the decision above cited, prevent the American Government from taxing the company, even if the latter had accepted\u00a0 and ratified the concession.<br\/><br\/>It is said, however, by the company, that although there may be no exemption from taxation in the Visayan concession, there is one in the Hongkong concession\u00a0 which is applicable not only to that concession, but\u00a0 to the Visayan concession.\u00a0 That exemption is found in article 3, paragraph 3, of the royal decree, and is as follows: <blockquote> \"ART. 3. The laying of the cable, its landing at Manila, and its working, shall be\u00a0 carried out at the expense and risk of the above-mentioned company, in exchange for the concession to the same of the following privileges;<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"3. The assimilation of the company's employees to those of the State telegraphs, so\u00a0 that the\u00a0 former may enjoy the\u00a0 same privileges; and the exemption of\u00a0 the company's property\u00a0 from taxes and local imposts.\"<\/blockquote>There is no evidence to show that any of the property used by the company in the operation of its Hongkong cable is used in. the operation of the Visayan cables; in fact, it is apparent that as far as the cables themselves are concerned and their landing places, there is no connection whatever between the two systems. The only thing that perhaps appears is that the same officers manage both.\u00a0 To our minds the two concessions constitute two separate and distinct contracts between the Spanish Government and the company.\u00a0 There is no connection between them, except, first, the fact that they were granted to the same company, and, second, a clause in the Hongkong concession relating to the deposit which the company was required to make when the concession was\u00a0 granted. By the terms of the Visayan concession, which was\u00a0 prior in date, the company was bound to deposit 100,000 pesetas with the Government.\u00a0 In the Hongkong concession there is a similar requirement, but in the contract made between the Government and the company it was provided that in view of the fact that the work of the Visayan cables had been practically completed when the Hongkong concession was made the deposit of 100,000 pesetas made in conformity with the provisions of the Visayan concession might be considered as\u00a0 the deposit required by the Hongkong concession.<br\/><br\/>It can not be said that this agreement in regard to the deposit, or the fact that the concessionaire was the same in both cases, or both facts, would make the terms of the Hongkong contract\u00a0 applicable to the Visayan contract. The proper construction of the exemption of the\u00a0 Hongkong concession is that, the property of the company used in connection with that concession should be exempt, but that the property used by: the same company in connection with another contract entered into between it and the Government should not be exempt.\u00a0 Whether the company would be exempt from this tax if the article in the Hongkong concession were applicable to the Visayan concession, we do not decide. The receipts of the company tor the business transacted over the Visayan cables come clearly within the terms of section 139, and the company is liable for the tax thereby imposed.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is alleged\u00a0 in the complaint that of the sum of P97,912.Q6 collected for domestic traffic, P6,539.70 was collected as surtaxes, in.accordance with\u00a0 the provisions of article 18 of the Visayan concession, above quoted.\u00a0 There was testimony showing that for every word sent over the Visayan cables to the Islands of Panay, Negros, and Cebu from other islands in the Archipelago, there was collected 55 centimes of a franc, of which 50 centimes belonged to the company and 5 centimes to the Government.\u00a0 In other words, this surtax of 5 centimes of a franc never belonged to the company and in its collection it acted merely\u00a0 as an agent Of the\u00a0 Government.\u00a0 We, therefore, think that the amount thereof can\u00a0 not be considered as a part of\u00a0 the gross receipts of the business of the plaintiff, and that it should be deducted\u00a0 from the sum of P97,912.06, leaving a balance of P91,372.36.<br\/><br\/>It is claimed by the company, and some evidence was presented to prove, that the American Government ha4 accepted and ratified these concessions and was bound by their terms, including the payment of the subsidy of \u00a34,500 per annum for the Visayan cables.\u00a0 We do not see how\u00a0 this question concerning the acceptance of the concessions by\u00a0 the\u00a0 American Government\u00a0 can in any way affect the decision in this case.\u00a0 If the company has any claims against the Government by reason of the subsidy, it must seek relief in some other way.\u00a0 In fact, in the complaint in this action no reference whatever is made thereto and no relief is sought on that ground.<br\/><br\/>The court below ordered the repayment to the plaintiff of the entire amount paid by it as taxes, namely, P2,027.18. In accordance with the views above stated, recovery should not have been had for all of the taxes paid, but only for those paid on\u00a0 account of the foreign business and on account of the surtax, and that judgment is modified by reducing the recovery from P2,027.18 to P1,722.60, and interest thereon\u00a0 as stated in the said judgment.\u00a0 As thus modified, the judgment of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of\u00a0 the\u00a0 first\u00a0 instance.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The petitioner alleged that\u00a0 the said tract\u00a0 of land contained\u00a0 a superficial area of 284,921.42 square meters.\u00a0 The plaintiff also alleged that he had acquired the land by gift from Raymundo Rodriguez and that said gift was made\u00a0 upon the 18th day of................ to the said Atanasia Carlos, his wife, and that he had registered his title in the registry of property of the Province of Tarlac during the existence of the sovereignty of Spain in the Philippine Islands, which\u00a0 registry had been destroyed by the <i>insurrectos<\/i>. The petitioner also alleged that\u00a0 said property had been taxed by\u00a0 the present Government and had been valued at $2,500, United States currency.<br\/><br\/>To this petition of the petitioner the Attorney-General of the Philippine Islands appeared and opposed the registration of the said property, upon the ground that said land was the property of the Government of the United States and under the control of the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause in the lower court, the judge of said court rendered a judgment in favor of the petitioner and against the respondent, in which judgment he made the following finding of facts:<br\/><blockquote>\"The petitioner, Atanasia Carlos, is in possession of the land described in the petition, having acquired the same as a gift from her uncle, Raymundo Rodriguez, in the year 1872, more than thirty years ago, and she devoted a part of it to the cultivation of paddy and corn, and a part to buildings belonging to the different tenants who rent the same, as shown on the plan exhibited and by the testimony of witnesses.<br\/><br\/>\"On account of the opposition filed by the Insular Government, based on the lack of concession granted by the Spanish Government, the determination of the case, tried on the 22d of March, 1905, Avas suspended by agreement made with the Insular Government's representative, until a decision is rendered by the Supreme Court in the case No. 319) (Inchausti &amp; Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Commanding General, 6 Phil. Rep., 556), decided by the undersigned to the effect that Government agricultural lands may be acquired by prescription.<br\/><br\/>\"The above-cited case was decided by the court, but without mentioning the question of prescription, on the ground that the land referred to is not agricultural but is for building purposes.\u00a0 It is affirmed in the decision, however, that, should the land in question be really public, within the meaning of the judgment appealed, it would be worth while considering again the doctrine laid down by the court in a case\u00a0 in which the majority established the impossibility of prescription with respect to Government lands.<br\/><br\/>\"Bearing in mind the proviso made by the Supreme Court in the decision above referred to, and in view of the result of the evidence, it would be proper to quote the decision rendered in the said case, inasmuch as it deals with a land which is partially agricultural.\u00a0 Yet, this action will give rise to an appeal which will entail many expenses for the appellant, who should be subjected only to those that are necessary, and is entitled to obtain a prompt determination of his case; therefore, taking into consideration the fact that a possession\u00a0 of\u00a0 not\u00a0 only ten but of more than thirty years was proven, and that during this last period of time prescription runs against the State as well as against private individuals, the writer of this judgment applies to this case the provisions of section 54, No. 6, of the Public Land Act, for although not expressly invoked by the petitioner, according to a decision rendered by the Supreme Court, of December 3, 1906, in case No. 975 of this court (Order of Dominicans <i>vs.<\/i> Insular Government, 7 Phil. Rep., 98), by the mere fact of their being in force the laws must be made applicable to cases coming under their provisions.\u00a0 The Director of the Bureau of Lands was not served with summons to appear in\u00a0 this case, inasmuch as the petitioner\u00a0 did not claim for his benefit the provisions of Act\u00a0 No. 926, but in behalf of the Government, the official appeared who would have represented the former official had\u00a0 he been\u00a0 served\u00a0 with summons before the date of the trial.\u00a0 As possession for ten years previous to the enactment of said act was sufficiently proven, and a general declaration of default against all other objectors being recorded beforehand, it is hereby decreed and adjudged that said land be registered in the name of Atanasia Carlos.<br\/><br\/>\"Manila, December 10, 1906.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"S. DEL ROSARIO, <i>Judge<\/i>,\"<\/div><\/blockquote>From this\u00a0 decision of the court\u00a0 below the respondent appealed and assigned the following errors:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. The Court of Land Registration erred in finding that the petitioner acquired by prescription the land which she is seeking to register.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The Court of Land Registration likewise\u00a0 erred in applying to this case the provisions of Act No. 926, notwithstanding the fact that same was not expressly invoked by the petitioner.\"<\/blockquote>Both of these contentions of the Attorney-General have been\u00a0 decided against him.\u00a0 In the case of the Order of Dominicans <i>vs.<\/i> The Insular Government (7 Phil. Rep., 98), in considering the question presented in the second assignment\u00a0 of error above noted, this court said\u00a0 (p. 102), with reference to the application of paragraph 6 of section 54 of Act No. 926 of the Philippine Commission:<br\/><blockquote>\"The fact that relief was not specifically sought under this act is not important.\u00a0 The petitioner asked generally that its ownership of the land be registered.\u00a0 That petition should be granted if the evidence shows that it was entitled to such relief under any law in force in the Islands.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Pamintnan et al. <i>vs.<\/i> The Insular Government<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> (5 Off. Gaz., 698), this court again said upon this same question (p. 699) :<br\/><blockquote>\"Notwithstanding the fact that the Public Land Act (No. 926) has not been expressly\u00a0 invoked, and that although\u00a0 the act was passed on\u00a0 the\u00a0 7th of October,\u00a0 1903, it only\u00a0 went into effect on the 26th of July, 1904\u2014that is, months after the application for registration had been presented, to\u00a0 wit, the 12th of December, 1903\u2014yet, in deciding a case, the courts must see to it that their determinations conform to the law in force and applicable, and with a greater reason if by means of such later law a right has for the first time been declared which, though it may originate in a\u00a0 matter subject to former laws, yet is not prejudicial to a third party.\"<\/blockquote>In the present case the petitioner presented evidence during the trial of the cause which showed that he had been in the actual, uninterrupted, and peaceable possession of such lands for a period of nearly thirty years; that no one had questioned the title in any way whatever; that the Government had taxed such\u00a0 lands, and that he had paid such taxes.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 6 of section 54 of said Act No. 926 provides, in effect, that all persons, or their legal successors\u00a0 in right, occupying public lands in the Philippine Islands, or claiming to own any such lands, or an interest therein, but whose titles to such lands have not been perfected and who by themselves or their predecessors in interest have been in open, continuous,\u00a0 exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of agricultural public lands,\u00a0 as defined by the act of Congress of July 1, 1902, under a bona fide claim of ownership, except as against the Government, for a period of ten years next preceding the taking effect of this act, may apply to the Court of Land Registration of the Philippine Islands for a confirmation of their claims and the issuance of a certificate of title therefor, and shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a Government grant and to have received the same, and shall be entitled to a certificate of title to such land under the provisions of said chapter.<br\/><br\/>Considering the terms of this\u00a0 law, and the fact that the petitioner had been in possession of the lands in question for a period of thirty years or more, by himself and his predecessors, and had planted thereon\u00a0 various crops continuously, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that he is entitled to the benefits of said paragraph 6 of section 54 of Act No. 920, and that he is conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a\u00a0 Government grant, and to\u00a0 have received the name, and is therefore entitled to a certificate of title to such land under the provisions of that article.\u00a0 (Pamintuan et al. <i>vs.<\/i> The Insular Government, 5 Off.

The defendants demurred to the complaint and the case is now before us for resolution of this demurrer.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the complaint that judgment was entered in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pangasinan in favor of the defendant Tan Chu Chay and against the plaintiff Isabelo Artacho, for the sum of P3,430, with interest and costs.\u00a0 This judgment was afterwards affirmed by this court, the case remanded to the Court of First Instance, and execution issued upon the judgment and delivered to the defendant, Antonio Sison, sheriff of the Province of Pangasinan, for service. The sheriff made a demand upon the plaintiff Artacho for the payment of the amount of the judgment, which payment was refused by the plaintiff on the ground, as alleged in the complaint, that, prior to such demand, the debt due from him to the defendant Tan Chu Chay had been legally attached by the sheriff of Manila in a suit brought by a creditor of Tan Chu Chay against the latter in the Court of First Instance of Manila.\u00a0 The defendant Sison reported to the\u00a0 Court of First Instance of Pangasinan the answer of the plaintiff, Artacho, and the judge thereof, one of the defendants, thereupon ordered the issue of a second execution upon the judgment hereinbefore referred to.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff then commenced this proceeding in this court and secured a temporary injunction restraining the levy of the execution.<br\/><br\/>It is alleged in the complaint that, in ordering the issue of a second execution, the defendant-judge exceeded his jurisdiction and that such order was absolutely void.\u00a0\u00a0 This contention can not be\u00a0 sustained.\u00a0 The Court of Pangasinan had jurisdiction of the case of Tan Chu Chay against the plaintiff Artacho, jurisdiction both of the parties and of the subject-matter, and the mere fact that some creditor of Tan Chu Chay had attached the debt due from Artacho to the former did not oust that court from its jurisdiction to proceed with the case. (See among other cases decided by this court: Hubert &amp; Guamis <i>vs.<\/i> Sweeney, 4 Phil. Rep., 473; Somes <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Crossfield, 8 Phil.

Rep., 95:)<br\/><br\/>Whether, in order to prevent a double payment, the plaintiff can maintain an action in the Court of First Instance under section 120 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or whether he can accomplish that result by some other proceeding in that court, it is not for us now to decide; it is sufficient to say that the present action of certiorari can not be maintained.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer is sustained, and the plaintiff is given five days in which to amend\u00a0 his complaint.\u00a0 If no such amendment is presented within that time, the clerk, without any further order of\u00a0 this court,\u00a0 will\u00a0 enter a\u00a0 final judgment for the defendants with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

It is claimed by the appellant that the power of attorney given by the defendant to Lopez did not authorize him to execute this instrument.\u00a0 We do not find it necessary to decide this question because we think that the subsequent conduct of the defendant in relation thereto amounted to a ratification thereof.<br\/><br\/>As to the amount actually due from the defendant to the plaintiff, there is no question.<br\/><br\/>On the 31st day of December, 1904, the defendant agreed in writing that the amount due from him to the plaintiff was P35,801.71.\u00a0 It is claimed by the appellant that he did not examine the accounts fully when he signed this statement and that there was an understanding that there should be a further examination and a definite liquidation.\u00a0 This claim is not supported by the evidence, and we are satisfied that the defendant, on the date last mentioned, finally and definitely\u00a0 agreed\u00a0 that he\u00a0 owed the amount stated in that liquidation.<br\/><br\/>The mortgage contains\u00a0 the following clause:<br\/><blockquote>\"Eighth.\u00a0 Notwithstanding all\u00a0 the\u00a0 foregoing, the said Messrs. Hollmann &amp; Co. bind themselves to pay the above-named Ceferino Domingo, for expenses and other requirements of the haciendas of Janiuay, of this province, and Murcia, Island of Negros, up to three hundred Mexican dollars monthly for each hacienda, as it may be required, which amount will be charged\u00a0 to the same debt above acknowledged.\"<\/blockquote>At the time the defendant signed the statement of December 31, 1904, the evidence shows that he examined\u00a0 a more detailed statement of account which was presented in evidence.\u00a0 That account shows repeated payments by the plaintiff from time to time of P600, evidently in accordance with the terms of the mortgage.\u00a0 It further appears that the plaintiff suspended the monthly payments for March and April of 1904, and that the defendant objected to such suspension.\u00a0 The evidence for the plaintiff also shows that the lawyer for the plaintiff had all the papers relating to this case in his office for two years, attempting to get a settlement with the defendant; that he had repeated conferences with the defendant, showed him all of the accounts relating thereto, and that the defendant never made any claim as to the invalidity of the mortgage, but simply requested further time in\u00a0 which to pay the debt.\u00a0 The defendant does not now in his testimony say that he did\u00a0 not know of the existence of the mortgage and of its terms. We are satisfied from all the evidence in the case that he did know of the existence of the mortgage and of the terms thereof, and that he voluntarily accepted the benefits conferred upon\u00a0 him by the contract by accepting the monthly payments therein mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0 Such\u00a0 action on\u00a0 his\u00a0 part amounted to a ratification of the mortgage within the terms of, article 1511 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>The judgment\u00a0 of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, G.

His claim that under the provisions of Act No. 1533, providing for the diminution of sentences in consideration of good conduct and diligence, he is entitled to an\u00a0 allowance of eight months and twenty-four days for good conduct, is manifestly untenable; under that Act,.the convict is entitled\u00a0 to diminish\u00a0 the period of his sentence \"five days for each full month, commencing with the first day of his arrival at the provincial or Insular jail or prison, during which he has not\u00a0 been guilty of a violation of discipline or any of the rules of the prison, and has labored with diligence\u00a0 and fidelity upon all such tasks as have been assigned to him.\"\u00a0 Upon his own showing, the petitioner began serving his sentence of three years and six months on December 7,1906, so that on August 9,1908, he had served but one year, seven months, and twenty-eight days, and was entitled only to ninety-five days good-conduct time.\u00a0 Upon the date of his petition, August 25, as also upon this date, he had served but twenty <i>full months,<\/i> and is entitled, therefore, to a deduction of no more than one hundred days, granting that he has not been guilty of any violation\u00a0 of discipline or of the rules of the prison,\u00a0 and has labored with diligence and fidelity upon\u00a0 all tasks assigned to him.\u00a0 Without examining his claims for allowances on account of voluntary labor performed during his detention pending trial, or on\u00a0 account of the allowance provided for in his sentence, his claim of eight months and twenty-four days is one hundred and sixty days in excess of that to which he could possibly be entitled.\u00a0 The period to\u00a0 which he was sentenced, granting that he is, as he alleges, entitled to all the allowances provided for by law, has not yet expired ; and the\u00a0 petition for a writ of habeas corpus should be and is, therefore, denied.\u00a0 Bo ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

JUAN XAVIER, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT. <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>WILLARD, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The plaintiff, claiming to be the assignee of Manuel Avancenia and of Claro Jetorian, who were in turn assignees respectively of Aniceto Lacson and Eulalio Lacson, brought this action in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Iloilo to recover damages for a breach of two separate contracts made by the defendant, one with Aniceto Lacson and the other\u00a0 with Eulalio Lacson, by the terms of which the defendant, who lived in the Province of Antique, agreed to furnish to Aniceto Lacson 250 men to work upon his sugar estate in Negros from November, 1902, to May, 1903, and 100 men to Eulalio Lacson for the same purpose.<br\/><br\/>The court below found that the defendant had not fulfilled either of the contracts and ordered judgment against him for 10,000 pesos.\u00a0 From this judgment the defendant has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The first error assigned by the appellant is to the effect that the action should have been brought against Juan Xavier &amp; Co., and not against Juan Xavier.\u00a0 This contention can not be sustained.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the receipt signed on the 15th day of July, 1902, by the agent of the defendant, that the only contracts made by Aniceto Lacson and Eulalio Lacson, were contracts made with the defendant personally.\u00a0 It is true that these receipts, for the purpose of determining the conditions of the contract refer to another document, which was received in evidence, and that in this document one of the contracting parties appears to be Xavier &amp; Co., and not Xavier.\u00a0 But this document was not signed either by Aniceto Lacson or by Eulalio Lacson.\u00a0 It apparently is an agreement between members of a partnership organized in Antique\u00a0 for the purpose of furnishing laborers\u00a0 to the sugar planters of Negros, and its only purpose in this case was to make the conditions therein mentioned\u00a0 a part of the conditions of the contract between Aniceto Lacson and Eulalio Lacson, on one part, and Juan Xavier on the other.<br\/><br\/>By the terms of the contract between the parties, the sugar planters were to pay in advance 8 pesos for each workman in two installments of 4 pesos each.\u00a0 The first installment of 4 pesos was paid but the second installment was not, and the defendant claims that the Lacsons, not haying complied with the contract on their part by paying the second installment, no recovery can be had in this case.\u00a0 The defendant himself, however, testified at the trial that, when the time came for the payment of the second installment, he did not demand it because he knew then that he could not furnish the laborers in accordance with his contract.\u00a0 The nonpayment of this installment, therefore, is no defense to the action.<br\/><br\/>The third assignment of error, however, must be sustained.\u00a0 It\u00a0 was alleged in\u00a0 the complaint that Aniceto Lacson\u00a0 had assigned all of his rights under his contract to Manuel Avance\u00f1a, and that Eulalio Lacson had assigned all of his rights\u00a0 under his contract to Claro\u00a0 Jetorian.\u00a0 It was further alleged that Manuel Avancenia and Claro Jetorian had assigned their rights to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>There was a general denial in the answer which put in issue these allegations of the complaint with reference to the assignments and it was, therefore,\u00a0 necessary for the plaintiff to prove them.\u00a0 He did prove the assignments to Manuel Avance\u00f1a and to Claro Jetorian.\u00a0 No proof, however,\u00a0 was offered of\u00a0 any assignment by those two last-named persons to the plaintiff.\u00a0 The plaintiff offered and there was\u00a0 received in evidence over the objection\u00a0 and exception of the defendant, a document dated on the 11th of May, 1903,\u00a0 between Manuel Avance\u00f1a and Claro Jetorian on the one part and the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 on the other. This document is an agreement for the\u00a0 settlement of\u00a0 the claims here in controversy.\u00a0 By the terms thereof, Xavier promised to repay to Manuel Avancenia 1,000 pesos and to Claro Jetorian 400 pesos, to pay the additional sum of 1,712 pesos for the expenses of the steamer and lorcha which\u00a0 were sent to Antique to get the workmen, and to pay\u00a0 the additional sum of 2,500 pesos, as fees for\u00a0 the plaintiff, who\u00a0 was the lawyer of Avance\u00f1a and Jetorian. The defendant was given forty days from the date of\u00a0 the contract in\u00a0 which to perform the\u00a0 terms thereof, and it was agreed that the criminal and civil actions which were then pending\u00a0 against Xavier in the Court of First\u00a0 Instance of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Province of Occidental Negros should\u00a0 be suspended, and if the defendant complied with the terms of the settlement that they should be dismissed.\u00a0 It was also provided that, if this sum of 5,612 pesos was not paid within forty days, the civil and criminal proceedings should continue.\u00a0 The time for the performance of this contract was afterwards extended to the 15th day of September, 1903.\u00a0 The defendant paid 1,000 pesos but\u00a0 did not in other respects comply with his agreement.\u00a0 At the foot of this document there is the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"I indorse this document in favor of Ramon Orozco, attorney at law, a resident of Iloilo.<br\/><br\/>\"Talisay, February 1, 1905.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"M.

Abellana, clerk of the court of Binondo, Manila, be annulled and declared void and of no effect, and that an administrator be appointed for the estate of the said Cayetana Matias, deceased.<br\/><br\/>The trial court held that the will in question had been duly executed in conformity with the provisions of law in force at the date of its execution, and rendered judgment against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>To this judgment plaintiff exempted, and submits the following assignment of errors as the ground of his appeal:<br\/><blockquote>\"(1) The court erred in considering the witnesses Jose Fernandez Llamazenes, Ricardo Gutierrez, and Vicente Anastasio, as residents of the district of Binondo.<br\/><br\/>\"(2) The court erred in considering the document attached to Exhibit B, by saying: 'That on the 16th day of March, 1894, the counsel for the relatives of Cayetana Matias, among whom the plaintiff, asked for the declaration of the intestacy of the estate of the former, which petition was denied by the court of Cavite, because Don Agustin Alvarez exhibited a copy of the will now in question.'<br\/><br\/>\"(3) The court erred in considering 'that the provisions of the Notarial Law of May 28, 1862, were only known since its enforcement in these Islands on July 1, 1889, and that only from that time Were the same applicable.'<br\/><br\/>\"(4) The court erred in construing the words 'be executed *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * of the pueblos' contained in Law 7, title 23, book 10 of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion<\/i>, by concluding that any notary <i>public del numero<\/i> may certify a will, although he is not a resident of the town.<br\/><br\/>\"(5) The court erred in the construction of the words 'these persons only may exercise said office, and contracts between the parties shall be executed before these persons or any of them only, as well as obligations and wills,' contained in Law 7, title 23, book 10 of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"(6) The court erred in ignoring the words 'and not before any others' of the law before mentioned.<br\/><br\/>\"(7) The court erred in ignoring the words 'And should such documents be executed before any other persons, they shall be null and void,' of the same law above mentioned.<br\/><br\/>\"(8) The court erred in the construction of the words 'that the notaries unregistered do not intervene to receive such contracts or wills,' of the same law, above cited.<br\/><br\/>\"(9) The court erred in construing the words 'No notary shall attest unless he is a royal notary (<i>escribano real<\/i>),' of Law 8, title 23, book 10 of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"(10) The court erred in the construction of the words 'or should it be *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * in order to become a registered notary, or for the office to which he may be appointed,' of the said Law 8.<br\/><br\/>\"(11) The court erred in considering the presence of seven witnesses necessary.<br\/><br\/>\"(12) The court erred in judging that the unity of act (<i>unidad del acto<\/i>) in the execution was unnecessary.<br\/><br\/>\"(13) The court erred in considering valid a will in which the notary, although registered in the town where the will was executed, was not registered in the town of which the testator was a resident; and that it is sufficient that the witnesses (no matter how many they are) are residents of the place of the execution, and that they are present\u00a0 <i>a lo ver otorgar;<\/i> that is, that they see and understand the testator.<br\/><br\/>\" (14) The court erred in affirming that the law does not require the notary to be registered in the pueblo of the testator.<br\/><br\/>\" (15) The court erred in affirming that 'the residence of the testator is not one of the requisites prescribed by law for the authenticity of the will, and that, therefore, its validity does not depend upon such residence but upon the concurrence of the other requisites.'<br\/><br\/>\" (16) The court erred in admitting 'the declarations of the two witnesses presented by the defendant as a proof of the residence of the witnesses of the will.'<br\/><br\/>\" (17) The court erred in believing that the omission committed by the concurring notary, regarding the residence of the instrumental witnesses Llamazenes, Gutierrez, and Anastasio, as. well as the knowledge of the testatrix, which he ought to have stated in the same instrument, could be supplied by the statements of the witnesses Juan Garcia Perez and Rafaela Gomez.<br\/><br\/>\"(18) The court erred in considering that, when, on account of illness or for any other reason, the testator could not sign, it would be sufficient for the notary to so state, and that, it appearing in the same will, that the testatrix Cayetana Matias did not know how to sign, and the other testator Agustin Alvarez having subscribed the will, the plaintiff's allegation has no foundation.<br\/><br\/>\"(19) The court erred in considering that the will in question was executed legally and produced its legal effects by the death of the testatrix, not only before the enactment of the new Code of Civil Procedure, but also before the Civil Code was in force.<br\/><br\/>\"(20) The court erred in affirming that this will is valid and legalized.<br\/><br\/>\"(21) Finally, the court erred in disregarding the doctrines laid down in similar cases, both by the supreme court of Spain and by the Supreme Court of these Islands.\"<\/blockquote>We think that none of the errors assigned can be sustained and that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>Most of the errors assigned are based on the alleged lack of conformity of the nuncupative will in question with the technical formalities prescribed by Jaw for the execution of such instruments. It is important, therefore, at the outset, to determine what were the provisions of law in force in these Islands touching the execution of last wills and testaments in the year 1873, when it is admitted this will was made.<br\/><br\/>Evidently not the Civil Code nor the new Code of Civil Procedure, which were not enacted until many years afterwards, nor the Notarial Law of the 28th of November, 1862, because that law was not put into effect in the Philippines until the 1st of July, 1889, as appears from the royal decree of February 15 of that year.\u00a0 Hence the provisions of the <i>\"Novisima Recopilacion\"<\/i> which, prescribe the various in odes by which wills might be executed, doing away with most of the formalities of the Roman law which were adopted into the laws of the<i> Partidas<\/i>, must be taken as the law controlling the execution of such wills at the time when the will in question was executed. (Decisions of the supreme court of Spain, July 28, 1840, and December 6, 1861.)<br\/><br\/>These provisions to which we must look in deciding any question touching the validity of the will under consideration, when such question is based upon an alleged defect in the mode whereby it was executed or a failure to comply with any of the formalities prescribed by law, are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Should anyone make his nuncupative testament or last will before a notary public, he should do so in the presence of at least three witnesses, who must be residents of the locality wherein the will is made; and should the will be made without the attendance of a notary public, the presence of at least five witnesses, who, as stated above, shall be residents of the locality, must be secured if they can be found therein; and should neither the presence of a notary public nor that of five witnesses be obtained in said locality there must be in attendance at least three witnesses, residents thereof; *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *,\" (Law 1, title 18, book 10, of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion<\/i>, which is title 19 of the Ordinances of Alcala.)<br\/><br\/>\"We hereby order and decree that the provisions contained in the statute of the King Don Alfonso *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *, relative to the number of witnesses required for the execution of a will, be understood to be applicable to open wills, also called 'nuncupative' in Latin, whether said wills be made among children or legitimate heirs, or among strangers. But in the execution of closed wills, called <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in scriptis<\/span> in Latin, we direct that there must be in attendance at least seven witnesses and a notary public.*\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\" (Law 2, title 18, book 10, of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion<\/i>, or the Third Law of Toro.)<br\/><br\/>\"Written contracts, obligations, and wills must be executed before the notaries royal and public of the locality.<br\/><br\/><i>\"Don Fernando and Dona Isabel, in Toledo, in the year ; and Don Felipe II, in the pear 1566.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"We direct that in all cities, villages, and places of our kingdoms where there are registered notaries public, that said officials be the only ones intrusted with the performance of the duties pertaining to their office and that they be the only officials before whom written contracts, obligations, and wills may be executed and before no others; should said writings be certified by other persons, they shall be null and void, although they may admit of proof to establish their validity; and we further order that unregistered notaries public shall not, under penalty of a fine of 20,000 <i>maravedis<\/i> and loss of office, intervene in the certification of said contracts and wills; however, the other notaries public who are competent and of good reputation may attest all extrajudicial papers\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * the provisions of Law 3, title 32, book 12, shall be observed; but in small villages not having registered notaries *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\" (Law 7, title 23, book 10 of the <i>Norisima Recopilacion.<\/i><br\/><br\/><i>\"D. Felipe II, in Madrid f in the year I066.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"We hereby order and decree that no notary may, in the territory of our kingdoms and domains, attest any contract or will, or any judicial or extrajudicial paper, unless he be a royal notary, in the form prescribed in the preceding law, or a notary examined and licensed by our council to perform either the duties of a registered notary or those to which he has been appointed, as otherwise he shall' be guilty of falsification and the contract or deed shall be null and void; this provision is to be observed in the territories of our kingdoms as well as in those subject to the suzerainty of the orders, of a seigniory or of an abbot, notwithstanding any possession or custom of time immemorial to the contrary.\" (Law 8, title 23, book 10 of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion<\/i>.)\"<\/blockquote>The first, sixteenth, and seventeenth errors assigned may be considered together. Appellant contends that the court erred in finding that the witnesses whose names are attached to the will were residents of the suburb of Binondo where it was executed; and that the court erred in receiving the testimony of witnesses as to that fact, because not having been certified by the clerk of the court before whom the will was executed, the trial court had no authority to receive testimony to supply the omission.<br\/><br\/>We think the testimony of record conclusively establishes the fact that the persons whose names appear as witnesses to the will were at the date of its execution residents of the place where it was executed; and that the mere omission of that fact from the certificate of the clerk, before whom the will was executed, is not sufficient to invalidate the will, when the fact has been conclusively established <i>aliunde<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>This was the view taken by the supreme court of Spain, in its <i>sentencia<\/i> of February 25, 1881, wherein it held as follows, in a case where a very similar omission was found to exist in the certificate of a notary:<br\/><blockquote>\"If the records disclose that in the execution of the will in litigation no violation was committed against the provisions of the law, of a prohibitive nature, contained in Law 2, title 23, book 10 of the<i> Novisima Recopilacion <\/i>in so far as it provides that the notary public shall not attest nor receive a writing should the parties executing the same be unknown to him; it being true that the notary who certified to the execution of the will in question was closely acquainted with the testator, according to the findings of the sentencing court; although the above-cited law provides that should the notary be acquainted with the testator, the former shall so state it in the registry; even under the supposition that this formality was not complied with in the attestation which the notary made of the contents of the will at the end thereof, such omission can not be deemed a cause of nullity in the present litigation, in 'which, besides the fact that the law itself has not made any provision therefor, it appears that the identity of the testator was not contested nor doubted; on the contrary, the appellants in their complaint recognize in an explicit manner the identity of the testator by averring that the will in question was executed by their uncle.\"<\/blockquote>There is nothing in the above-cited laws of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion<\/i> which declares a will invalid and of no effect because of an omission by the clerk before whom it was executed, of a certificate that the witnesses were residents of the place where it was executed, and the supreme court of Spain in commenting on these laws declared in its decision of December 6, 1861:<br\/><blockquote>\"If the expression of the will of the testator fully and legally appears in any of the manners prescribed by law, the will is valid,<br\/><br\/>\"The validity and efficiency of a nuncupative testament is essentially found in the open and public statement of the will of the testator, whether announced orally or by the reading of a paper, script, annotation, or memorandum, in order that those present at its execution may understand and remember its contents in the cases prescribed by law.\"<\/blockquote>It would be unreasonable to hold that \"where the open and manifest will of the testator\" has been set out in an otherwise valid document, such will would be declared invalid because of the lack of a certificate of the clerk, as to an unimportant detail, which was conclusively established by the testimony of competent witnesses.<br\/><br\/>The second error assigned by appellant is based on the admission in evidence of Exhibit B, which is a certified copy of the record of certain proceedings in the Court of First Instance of Cavite. Appellant opposed its admission on the ground that it was unimportant, immaterial, and irrelevant. It appears that appellant herself offered a part of this record in evidence and that the defendant moved that not merely the part indicated by the plaintiff, but all of these proceedings be received in evidence.<br\/><br\/>We think the court properly granted this motion, because in accordance with the provisions of section 283 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \"when part of an act, declaration, conversation, or writing is given in evidence by one party, the whole of the same subject may be inquired into by the other;\" and second, because the record of the proceedings in question was competent and relevant evidence as to the knowledge of the plaintiff of the existence of the will in question prior to the institution of this action, a fact which was denied in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>An examination. of the royal decree of February 15, 1889, extending to the Philippines the provisions of the Notarial Law of November 28, 1862, completely disposes of the third assignment of error.<br\/><br\/>The fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth errors all rest upon a misconception on the part of the appellant of the above-cited provisions of Laws 7 and 8, book 10, title 23 of the<i> Novisima Recopilacion<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Appellant contends that these laws required that the clerk of court, who alone was authorized to certify contracts and wills, should be the clerk<i> del numero <\/i>of the place of residence of the parties, and not of the place where the contract or will was made. An examination of the foregoing laws shows that there is no ground for such an unreasonable contention. Such a construction would have deprived the citizen of the right to execute a duly acknowledged contract or will beyond the place of his residence, and if the parties to a contract resided in different places, it would never have been possible for them to comply with such a condition.<br\/><br\/>The will having been certified by the clerk <i>del numero<\/i> of the locality where it was executed, the contentions of appellant as to the number of witnesses required in cases where a will is not so certified, falls to the ground, the law expressly fixing the number at three, in cases such as that under consideration.<br\/><br\/>In support of the twelfth assignment of error appellant relies on the provisions of Law 3, title 1, <i>Partida<\/i> 6, but, as has been said, the laws of the <i>Partidas<\/i>, at the date of the execution of the will in question, had been superseded by the above-cited provision of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion<\/i> which did away with many of the formalities of the ancient law, among others that known as <i>la unidad del acto<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Discussing this question, Falcon, in his work on <i>Derecho Civil Espa\u00f1ol<\/i> (vol. 3, p. 76), says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The request (<i>rogacion<\/i>) was required in Rome for special circumstances of those people. Among us the <i>rogacion<\/i> had no other meaning than that of an act of mere courtesy, which act, not being inherent to the essence of the will, could not constitute an essential requisite of the same.<br\/><br\/>\"The seals, which the Romans used so frequently and to which the <i>Partidas<\/i> gave so great importance, were in the same category regarding the closed will. The supreme court, in different cases had been compelled to decide, upon these and other requisites, to the effect that the most of the requisites prescribed by the laws of the <i>Partidas<\/i> were not observed.<br\/><br\/>\"The requisite called <i>unidad del acto<\/i> belonged to the same category, according to which the will was to be commenced and finished in one sole act, no other matter to interpose between the beginning and the end. This condition in Rome was derived from the old wills <i>in Comitiis Calatis<\/i>, because they contained but one act. Such requirement, however, ought not to be preserved any longer, because a will is not a law in which an entire people or nation intervene with authority.\"<\/blockquote>The eighteenth assignment of error is also based on the provisions of the ancient laws of the <i>Partidas<\/i>. The <i>Novisima Recopilacion<\/i>, however, does not expressly prescribe that in nuncupative wills the testator or testatrix must sign the instrument, though Gutierrez (p. 152 Est. <i>Fund, del Derecho Civil<\/i>), discussing this question, says :<br\/><blockquote>\"The law does not say whether the testator is to sign in the nuncupative will. Is his signature necessary? G. Lopez discusses this question which has divided the opinions of the commentators, and resolves the same affirmatively, on the following grounds: (1) On the<i> Pragmatica de Alcala, Ley recopilada<\/i> 1, title 23, book 10, which requires the same in all public instruments, under which denomination last wills are included; (2) on the theory that the motive and the object of the law are more important in this case than in any other act (<i>Glosa<\/i>,2, Law II, title 1, Partida. 6). For the same reasons, Matienzo follows this opinion in the <i>Glosa<\/i> 3, Nos. 8 et seq., it being so natural that this is to be done that we undoubtedly adhere to this doctrine, unless the testator can not sign on account of illness or for any other cause, in which case the notary must so state.\"<\/blockquote>But the supreme court of Spain in its decision of February 28, 1881, finally disposes of this question in the following language: \"That neither Law 1, title 18, book 10 of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion<\/i>, nor Law 1, title 1, of <i>Partida<\/i> 6, require, as a condition for the validity of the open or nuncupative will, that the testator sign, by himself or by another person in his name, the document in which he expresses his will,' and in any event, the certificate of the clerk having set out that the testatrix did not know how to write, we think that the omission of her signature should not be held to be a fatal defect invalidating the will.<br\/><br\/>What has been said renders it unnecessary to discuss errors 19, 20, and 21, except in so far as they are based on appellant's contention that section 617 of the new Code of Civil Procedure requires all Spanish ills to be probated in accordance with its provisions. It appears, however, that the testatrix died long before the new Code of Civil Procedure went into effect, hence the provision of section (517 is not applicable to the will in question. This will was a nuncupative will duly executed in the presence of the clerk of the court, in accordance with the provisions of law in force at the time of its execution, and upon the death of the testatrix it was not necessary that it should be proved or allowed in order that the estate conveyed therein should pass to the devisee. Manifestly it was not intended that the numberless Spanish wills of this character, executed by persons who had died long before the enactment of the new Code of Civil Procedure, should be brought into court for probate under its provisions.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the trial court should be, and is hereby, affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson, Willard,<\/i> and <i>Tracey,<\/i>\u00a0 concur.<br\/><i>Torres, J.,<\/i> concurs in the result.<\/div>",

and (2) had been in the possession thereof for more than ten years, uninterruptedly keeping it under cultivation, the date of the petition being April 1,1895.\u00a0 The persons who testified to said facts in that possessory information were the defendant, Alfonso Apdujan, and one of his witnesses, Isidro Rillas, the principal one in this controversy.<br\/><br\/>As to the second assignment of error, the testimony of three witnesses was duly considered by the trial court and neither violation of the law, preponderance of evidence to the contrary that should be considered, nor any other reason showing any error whatever has been charged against his findings.<br\/><br\/>The finding in the judgment, that the information offered as evidence by the plaintiff had not been impugned as false, is not erroneous.\u00a0 \"The applicable part of the document Exhibit A-see folio 99-is offered as evidence.\u00a0 It, is a legal and authentic copy of the record of possessory information by means of which the possession of the land referred to in the complaint was recorded in the registry of property of the Province of Misamis, in favor of the plaintiff, who was enjoying said possession as owner\u00a0 during the time shown by Exhibit A until April, 1899, when the spoliation which gave rise to this action took place.\u00a0 No objection by the attorney for the defendant.-Judge.\u00a0 Exhibit A is admitted as evidence.\"<br\/><br\/>Restituta Perucho appears to be the daughter of Nicolasa Perucho.\u00a0 The latter was the mistress of Apolonio Yjao.\u00a0 Nicolasa and Restituta Perucho claim no title to the land they hold other than that they inherited it from Apolonio Yjao.\u00a0 Neither does Apolonio Yjao allege any other title than that he inherited the same from Pedro Yjao, whom he calls his brother; the women call him their cousin, and others neither the one nor the other.\u00a0 Apolonio Yjao as the owner of the land adjoining that in question was duly summoned by the plaintiff in the said possessory information proceedings in 1895, and does not appear to have offered any objection whatever.\u00a0 As stated in said information, Pedro Yjao had sold said land ten years before, and, as attested by the plaintiff in this action, during the whole of said period continued to work the same, but for account of the plaintiff, and afterwards the plaintiff worked it for himself until despoiled of it in 1899, as already stated.<br\/><br\/>Far from being erroneous as claimed in the fourth assignment of error, the finding with regard to the restitution to the plaintiff, Sebastian Cabillas, of the land mentioned in the complaint is, on the contrary, in accordance with the law and the merits of the case.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed in so far as it orders the defendants, each of them in the respective portion, to return to the plaintiff the land described\u00a0 in the complaint, and so far as it sentences them to pay the costs.\u00a0 And the costs of this instance shall be against the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Co., a mercantile association of which plaintiff and appellee is liquidator, and which will hereinafter be referred to as the plaintiff company, jointly executed a notarial instrument, which was duly recorded in the mortgage registry of the city of Manila, wherein Ramirez solemnly acknowledged himself to be indebted to the plaintiff company in the sum of 10,000 pesos, local currency, received by him from the plaintiff company <i>\"en calidad de prestamo mutuo\"<\/i> (by way of, or in virtue of the class of loans (Joined in law 1, title 1, <i>partida<\/i> 5, and known as a simple loan under the provisions of article 1740 of the Civil Code.)\u00a0 In this instrument Ramirez obligated himself to pay the amount of this indebtedness \"in the early days\" of the year 1885 in sugar at the then market price, together with interest \"at the rate of 10 per cent annually\" and a certain agreed upon commission on each <i>picul<\/i> of sugar delivered; and as security for the fulfillment of the obligation thus assumed, Ramirez, <i>in the same instrument<\/i>, created a lien (<i>\"hipoteca\"<\/i> or mortgage under the civil law) upon certain property therein described, in favor of the plaintiff company.<br\/><br\/>On the 14th of August, 1885; Ramirez and the plaintiff company jointly executed a second notarial instrument, also duly recorded in the mortgage registry, of substantially the same tenor and effect as the former instrument, except that the amount of the indebtedness acknowledged in the second instrument was 10,125.01 7\/8 pesos, local currency, being the amount of the original indebtedness together with 125.01 7\/9 pesos, additional indebtedness contracted since the execution of the former instrument; and except also that the property upon which the lien was created was amplified by the addition of certain property described in the second instrument, and that the months of February and March of the year 1886 were designated as the date of payment of the indebtedness thus acknowledged and secured.<br\/><br\/>On the 14th of January, 1908, this action (<i>action hipotecaria<\/i>) was instituted to foreclose the lien created in these notarial instruments in favor of the plaintiff company and to recover the amount of the unpaid balance of the indebtedness solemnly acknowledged therein.<br\/><br\/>There is substantially no dispute as to the facts, except that defendant, whose sole defense rests on the alleged prescription of plaintiff's action, denied plaintiff's allegation of certain partial payments made after the date of the second instrument, and insisted that he had made no payment whatever on account of his alleged indebtedness.\u00a0 We are satisfied, however, that the evidence adduced at the trial conclusively establishes the correctness of the books of the plaintiff company in so far as they disclose that defendant Ramirez made remittances on account of his acknowledged indebtedness, amounting to 683.29 fresos in the year 1886; to 166.65 pesos in the year 1887; and to 342.29 pesos in the year 1888, the last of these remittances having been received by the plaintiff company on October 6 of the latter year; and that no other remittance or payments have been made by defendant on account of his indebtedness since that date.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for defendant and appellant contended in the court below and insists on appeal that the acknowledged indebtedness had its origin in a <i>mercantile<\/i> transaction governed by the provisions of the Mercantile Code, and therefore; under the provisions of that code, that the personal, right of action thereon had long prescribed before this action was instituted; and that the lien having been created merely to secure this indebtedness, the right of action to foreclose the lien must be taken to have prescribed at the same time as did the personal action to recover the indebtedness secured thereby.<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 should, perhaps, be sufficient answer to appellant's contention that the indebtedness had its origin in a <i>mercantile transaction<\/i>, to point out the express terms of the solemn notarial instrument acknowledging the indebtedness, wherein the parties themselves expressly declare the nature of the indebtedness to be that of a <i>\"prestamo mutuo\"<\/i> (a simple loan), which is one of the transactions governed by the provisions of the Civil Code and the body of laws which it replaced on its promulgation, and not by those of the Mercantile Code.\u00a0 (Arts. 1740, 1753, 1757, Civil Code; arts. 2 and 311\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Mercantile Code; law 1, title 1, <i>partida<\/i> 5.)\u00a0 But whatever may have been the true origin of the indebtedness we do not deem it necessary to discuss this particular contention at length, because it is clear from an examination of the facts as above set out that a strictly personal action to recover the amount of the acknowledged indebtedness would have prescribed prior to the date of the filing of the complaint not only by the lapse of the comparatively short period of prescription established in the Mercantile Code, granting that the transaction out of which the debt or obligation arose was a mercantile transaction and governed by the provisions of the Mercantile Code, but also from the lapse of the fifteen-year period of prescription established in the Civil Code, assuming that it was a simple loan (<i>prestamo mutuo<\/i>) governed by the provisions of that code.\u00a0 (Arts. 1964 and 1939, Civil Code.)\u00a0 So that, for the purposes of this decision, it is not important whether the original indebtedness arose as a result of a transaction governed by the Mercantile or the Civil Code, the real questions being, first, whether recourse could be had to the <i>\"action hipotecaria\"<\/i> (real action to foreclose a lien or mortgage) notwithstanding the fact that the personal action to recover the indebtedness had prescribed at the time when the <i>\"accion hipotecaria\"<\/i> was instituted; and, second, whether that action itself (the <i>\"accion hipotecaria\"<\/i>) had also prescribed at that time.<br\/><br\/>Under the laws and codes of Spain a comparatively long period of prescription was expressly provided for the <i>\"accion hipotecaria\"<\/i> (real action to foreclose a lien or mortgage), and different and more limited periods of prescription were provided for the various personal actions to enforce the fulfillment of those obligations, civil and mercantile, which are usually secured by the execution and registry of instruments creating liens or mortgages.\u00a0 But the mere lapse of the period within which a personal action to recover a debt or enforce an obligation prescribes does not extinguish or discharge the debt or obligation.\u00a0 It merely takes away the remedy by a personal action when the debtor sees fit\u00a0 to claim the privilege secured him by the statute; so that even after the lapse of the prescriptive period, if the debt has not; in fact been paid and the statute is not expressly pleaded, the debt will sustain a judgment in a personal action.\u00a0 (Aldeguer et al. <i>vs.<\/i> Hoskyn, 2 Phil. Rep., 500; Domingo <i>vs.<\/i> Osorio, 7 Phil. Rep., 405; Maxilom <i>vs.<\/i> Tabotabo, 9 Phil, Rep., 390.)\u00a0 And since the debt is not discharged or extinguished by the lapse of the comparatively short periods within which the personal actions prescribe, and the lawmaker has provided the <i>\"accion hipotecaria\"<\/i> (real action to foreclose) as one made for the recovery of an unpaid indebtedness secured by a lien or mortgage on real estate, no satisfactory reason can be suggested why the <i>\"accion hipotecaria\"<\/i> (real action to foreclose) may not be instituted to recover any debt secured by a duly recorded lien or mortgage, notwithstanding the lapse of the prescriptive period for a personal action to recover the debt, so long as the debt has not in fact been paid and this action itself has not prescribed.<br\/><br\/>In England and the United States a similar doctrine based upon essentially the same reasoning has generally prevailed in the absence of statutes expressly providing that the right to foreclose a mortgage is barred when the personal action to recover the mortgage debt is barred; or of statutes which, either expressly or in effect, provide for the same prescriptive period for suits in equity to foreclose a mortgage and actions on specialties as for actions on simple contracts generally.\u00a0 (Jones on Mortgages, 6th ed., vol., 2, 1204-1206, and cases there cited,\u00a0 more especially that of Lord <i>vs.<\/i> Morris, 18 Cal., 482, wherein the doctrine is discussed at length by Chief Justice Field.)<br\/><br\/>Having decided that the <i>accion hipotecaria<\/i> (action to foreclose the lien or mortgage) is not barred by the lapse of the prescriptive period for a personal action to recover the debt, it remains to determine whether in the case at bar the <i>accion hipotecaria<\/i> has or has not prescribed by the lapse of the prescriptive period expressly provided by law for that action. <br\/><br\/>Article 1939 of the Civil Code is as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Prescription, which began to run before the publication of this code, shall be governed by the prior laws; but if, after this code became operative, all the time required in the same for prescription has elapsed, it shall be effectual, even if according to said prior laws a longer period of time may be required.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The action to foreclose the mortgage in the case at bar accrued at the earliest on the 1st day of April, 1886, the date when the obligation secured became due and payable, as appears from the above set out statement of the contents of the mortgage instruments.\u00a0 (We say at the earliest, because for the purposes of this opinion it is not necessary, and we do not undertake to decide whether the partial payments on interest in 1886, 1887, and 1888 suspended the running of the period of prescription for the real action to foreclose the mortgage <i>accion hipotecaria<\/i>.)\u00a0 Hence, under the provisions of the above-cited article of the code, the prescriptive period of the law in force in these Islands before the code became operative must determine the time when the action to foreclose the lien in question prescribes, unless it appears that the action would prescribe in a shorter time, <i>if counting from the time when the code went into effect<\/i>, we apply the new and shorter prescriptive period provided in the code for such actions.\u00a0 (Pineda <i>vs.<\/i> Gasataya, 5 Phil. Rep., 139; Garcia et al. <i>vs.<\/i> Diamson, 8 Phil. Rep., 414.)<br\/><br\/>The prescriptive period, under the legislation in existence prior to the promulgation of the code, for actions to foreclose a mortgage or lien on real estate was thirty years, as appears from the following citation from <i>La Novisima Recopilacion<\/i> (<i>Ley 63 de Toro, 5, Tit. 8, Lib. 11<\/i>).<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The action to foreclose a mortgage shall prescribe at the expiration of ten years, and the personal action and execution thereon shall prescribe at the expiration of twenty years, and not less; but where the obligation is not secured by mortgage, or, where the obligation is both personal and real, the indebtedness shall prescribe at the expiration of thirty years, and not less; tnis shall be observed notwithstanding the law of King Alfonso, our ancestor, who provided that the personal action shall prescribe at the expiration of ten years.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>So that, applying the legislation in existence anterior to the promulgation of the code, the action to foreclose the mortgage in question would prescribe thirty \"years after the 1st day of April, 1886, when the cause of action acrued, that is to say, on the 1st day of April, 1916.\u00a0 Under the provisions of the Civil Code, actions to foreclose liens or mortgages (<i>acciones hipotecarias<\/i>) prescribe irr twenty years.\u00a0 (Art. 1964, Civil Code; art. 134,\u00a0 Mortgage Law.)\u00a0 Counting twenty years from the date when the\u00a0 code became operative, we have the 8th of December, 1909, as the date when the action would prescribe applying its provisions.\u00a0 And since this latter date is prior to the date of prescription under the former legislation, this must be taken as the date upon which the action in question would prescribe if the running of the prescriptive period were not interrupted.

Rep., 414.)<br\/><br\/>This action was instituted on the 14th of January, 1908, and, as appears above, the right of action to foreclose the lien in question not having prescribed on that date, plaintiff was clearly entitled to a judicial declaration of the amount of the indebtedness secured thereby at the time of the institution of the action and to have the necessary orders issue for foreclosure of his lien.<br\/><br\/>As will readily be seen from the above statement of facts proven and admitted, the payments or remittances made by the defendant in the years 1886, 1887, and 1888 on account of the indebtedness were not sufficient to cover the interest accruing in those years, respectively, so that the original indebtedness, secured by the mortgage instrument of 10,125.01 7\/8 pesos, local currency, was still due and unpaid at the time when this action was instituted, together with simple interest at the rate of 10 per cent thereon, as agreed in the mortgage instrument, less 1,192.23 pesos, the sum total of the payments made on account of the indebtedness and applied, or which ought to have been applied, to extinguish accrued interest in the years 1886, 1887, and 1888.\u00a0 (Art. 1173, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The trial judge, while properly holding that plaintiff's right of action to\u00a0 foreclose the lien had not prescribed, seems to have overlooked the fact that in ascertaining the amount of the indebtedness secured by the lien and still unpaid we must look to the terms of the instrument itself, and that no other indebtedness than that secured in the instrument, whether existing prior to its execution or arising thereafter, should be included in the order for payment out of the proceeds of the sale of the property upon which the lien was created.\u00a0 He found that the balance which the books of the plaintiff showed to be due by the defendant on the 19th day of November, 1888, not long after the receipt of the last remittance made on account of the indebtedness, was 15,365.68 pesos, local currency, and declared that this amount, together with P30,099.44, Philippine currency, interest thereon, was the amount secured by the instrument creating the lien, to recover which he directed the foreclosure of the lien.\u00a0 An examination of the books, however, clearly discloses that this balance was obtained by adding to the principal sum due and secured in the mortgage instrument itself compound interest and various other new and additional items of account not had in contemplation at the time when the mortgage instrument was executed, and it is evident, therefore, that the trial judge erred not only in including in his statement of the mortgage indebtedness items not contemplated in the mortgage instrument, but in allowing in the absence of an express agreement between the parties interest compounded semiannually on the original indebtedness down to the date when the balance in question was struck, and further in allowing simple interest upon this interest from that date until paid.\u00a0 In the absence of express agreement between\u00a0 the parties, interest upon interest can never be recovered save only in the cases, mentioned in article 1109 of the Civil Code, which permits the recovery of legal interest on accrued interest from the time when it has been made the subject of judicial demand, this provision, nevertheless, being limited to contracts originating since the code went into effect.\u00a0 (<i>Sentencia<\/i>, supreme court of Spain, 3d June, 1901; arts. 1109 and 1755, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The foreclosure order of the trial court should therefore be modified by substituting for so much thereof as declares the amount of the mortgage indebtedness to be 15,365.59 pesos, local currency, together with interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent from the 19th day of November, 1888, a declaration that the amount of the mortgage indebtedness still due and unpaid is 10,125.01 7\/8 pesos, together with interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent until paid from the 1st day of April, 1888, less 1,192.23 pesos, the amount of payments made and applied to interest in the years 1886, 1887, and 1888.<br\/><br\/>As to the right of the plaintiff under the special circumstances\u00a0 of this case to a decree against the defendant, under the provisions of section 260 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in the event that the property sold should not be sufficient to extinguish the indebtedness, we expressly reserve our opinion, that question not having been formally submitted upon this appeal.<br\/><br\/>Twenty days from date let judgment be entered, without costs to either party, directing the court below to enter a modified judgment in accordance with the principles laid down herein, and ten days thereafter let the record be remanded to the court wherein it originated.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Rep., 458; Enriquez et al. <i>vs.<\/i> Enriquez et al, 3 Phil. Rep., 746; Gavieres <i>vs.<\/i> Robinson et al., No. 4992, 7 Off. Gaz., 687.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>)\u00a0 This\u00a0 rule, however, does not require the lower court to make a finding upon all of the evidence adduced during the trial of the case.\u00a0 If his\u00a0 findings of fact are within the issue presented and sufficient to justify his conclusions, then the requirement of the law is complied with.\u00a0 If the court has omitted any fact or facts within the issue presented by the pleadings adduced during the trial which in law would overcome the facts found by the lower court, then the defeated party may by a proper appeal have this error corrected.\u00a0 It is the duty of the lower court to make a finding of all of the facts presented by the pleadings and supported by the proof.\u00a0 By reference to the decision of the lower court it will be found that he made the following finding of fact:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"That the defendant took possession of the land in question by permission of the plaintiff and her husband and occupied the land under this permission.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>If this finding of fact is true, and in accordance with the evidence adduced, and the defendant does not deny its truthfulness, it is sufficient, in the absence of other facts, to justify the conclusion of the lower court that the plaintiff was entitled to the possession of the property.\u00a0 If it is true, and the fact is not denied, that the defendant went into possession of said property with the express permission of the plaintiff and her husband, then she can not deny that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of said property, or, in other words, the defendant is estopped form denying that the land in question belongs to the plaintiff.\u00a0 Paragraph 2 of section 333 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides that the tenant is not permitted to deny the title of his landlord at the time of the commencement of the relation of landlord and tenant between them.\u00a0 This is given as one of the conclusive presumptions and no rule is better established than the doctrine contained in the above provision of the Code of Procedure.\u00a0 (See also Pascual <i>vs.<\/i> Angeles, 4 Phil. Rep., 604; judgment of the supreme court of Spain of December 6, 1882; judgment of the supreme court of Spain of October 12, 1889; Barlin <i>vs.<\/i> Ramirez, 7 Phil. Rep., 41.)<br\/><br\/>When it is once proven that the defendant obtained his possession from the plaintiff, in an action to recover possession of land, it\u00a0 then becomes unnecessary for the plaintiff to prove ownership for the reason that ownership in the plaintiff as against the defendant is presumed, and the defendant is estopped from denying the fact.\u00a0 Therefore the plaintiff in the lower court proved sufficient facts to obtain the possession of the property in question when she had proved that the defendant had obtained possession of the land from the plaintiff and by the plaintiff's permission, and it is not necessary for her to prove in addition to these facts that she was the owner.\u00a0 That fact was presumed and\u00a0 the defendant was estopped from denying it.\u00a0 This argument, we believe, answers the first, second, and third assignments of error made by the appellant.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the fourth assignment of error, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant went into possession of the property by permission of herself and husband.\u00a0 There is nothing to show under what conditions the defendant took possession of the property.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which shows that there was even the\u00a0 remotest intention on the part of the plaintiff to charge the defendant rent for the use and occupation of the property; it may have been a pure matter of charity, so far as the record shows.\u00a0 The record contains nothing upon which a judgment for rent prior to the commencement of the present action can be based.\u00a0 (Philippine Sugar Estates Development Company <i>vs.<\/i> Rosario, 2 Phil. Rep., 651.)\u00a0 The record does show, however, that the property in question had a rental value of P20 per year, and the lower court accepted this proof as to the\u00a0 value of the use and occupation of said property.\u00a0 The defendant makes no effort to show\u00a0 that P20 per year is not a reasonable value for the use of the property occupied by her.\u00a0 She has brought no proof to this court for the purpose of showing that said\u00a0 amount is not a reasonable amount.\u00a0 In the absence of proof to the contrary, therefore, we must adhere to this conclusion of the lower court.<br\/><br\/>The evidence did not justify the finding of the lower court that the plaintiff was entitled to recover P20 per annum for the use and occupation of said property from the month of February, 1900, to the date of the judgment (1907).\u00a0 In this respect the judgment of the lower court must be modified.\u00a0 The plaintiff is only entitled to recover rent for the use and occupation of the property from the time of the demand made for the possession, or from the 9th of June, 1906, the proof not being sufficient to show that the plaintiff was entitled to rent for the property proceeding the demand for the possession thereof.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the fifth and sixth assignments of error, we are of the opinion and so hold, that the lower court committed an error in deciding that the defendant should remove the house which she erected upon the property within thirty days and return the possession of the land to the plaintiff, or, in default of which, the house should become the property of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The proof clearly shows that the defendant went into possession of the land in question and erected her house thereon by and with the\u00a0 permission of the plaintiff, and therefore in good faith.\u00a0 The improvements thus made by the defendant, with the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff, can not become the property of the plaintiff except upon paying a due consideration to the defendant.\u00a0 (Arts. 361 and 364, Civil Code; Municipality of Oas <i>vs.<\/i> Roa, 7 Phil. Rep., 20; Valencia <i>vs.<\/i> Jimenez, 11 Phil. Rep., 492; Merchant <i>vs.<\/i> City of Manila, 11 Phil.

Reports, 414.)<br\/><br\/>Under the provisions of said article 361 in, its relation with articles 453 and 454 of the Civil Code, the plaintiff herein, under the facts in the present case, has the option of buying the improvements made by the defendant or of selling to the defendant the land upon which such improvements are located.\u00a0 (Merchant <i>vs.<\/i> City of Manila, 11 Phil. Rep., 116; Miller <i>vs.<\/i> Shumaker, 42 La. Annual, 393.)<br\/><br\/>Therefore the lower court committed an error in deciding that the plaintiff was entitled to become the owner of the house in question, if the defendant should fail or refuse to remove the same from the land in question, within a period of thirty days from the date of notice of said decision, and that part of the decision of the lower court is hereby revoked.<br\/><br\/>After a full consideration of the facts presented by the record in this cause, we are of the\u00a0 opinion and so hold,<br\/><br\/>(a)\u00a0 That the plaintiff is entitled to recover the possession of the property in question;<br\/><br\/>(b)\u00a0 To recover the sum of P20 per annum from the 9th day of June, 1906, the date of the demand for possession, until the defendant delivers possession of said property to the plaintiff;<br\/><br\/>(c)\u00a0 That the plaintiff has a right to elect to purchase the house in question from the defendant or to sell to the defendant the land upon which the house is located; and the cause is hereby remanded to the lower court with direction that the plaintiff be required to make this election within a period of thirty days after she receives notice of this decision.<br\/><br\/>It is hereby further directed that after the plaintiff has made her election, either to buy the house in question or to sell the land upon which the same is located, that then the Court of First Instance shall take such steps as may be necessary for the purpose of ascertaining the value of the house, in case the plaintiff elects to buy the same, and the value of the land, in case the plaintiff elects to sell it.<br\/><br\/>It is further directed that after the plaintiff has made her election and the price of the property in question is fixed by proper proceedings in the lower court, that then the lower court is hereby directed to render a judgment for the amount of the value of the property in favor of and against the proper parties.<br\/><br\/>Without any findings as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that the returns; submitted by the board of election of the said town in November, 1907, be confirmed; that they be so certified to the Governor-General of the Islands for such action as he may consider proper; that the attachment levied upon the property of the petitioner herein be set aside; that a writ of final injunction be served upon Simeon Nengasca ordering him to abstain from performing the duties of the office of municipal president of Aloguisan, unless he be duly elected at an election properly convened and held, or unless he be so ordered by the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 The petitioner alleges the following facts:<br\/><br\/>(1) That Alberto Lagahit and Simeon Nengasca were candidates for the office of municipal president of the municipality of Aloguisan, Province of Cebu; (2) that the result of said election, according to the returns of the election board were, Alberto Lagahit 33 votes, Simeon Nengasca 24, and Gregorio Yanong 11; (3) that on the 16th of November, 1907, Simeon Nengasca filed a protest with the Court of First Instance of Cebu against the above-mentioned election so far as the office of municipal president was concerned, alleging that the ballots of fifty-two qualified electors who voted for the said Nengasca had been abstracted and changed by the election inspectors, who, according to the protest, in addition, when filling up the ballots of electors who were unable to write, did not comply with their request to name Nengasca for the office of president, but on the contrary, put down the name of Alberto Lagahit; (4) that in the said protest the only remedy prayed for was, that the municipal elections in Aloguisan be annulled with respect to the office of municipal president, and that the court below certify to the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands that no person had been duly elected for the said office in said municipality of Aloguisan at the elections held in the month of November, 1907; (5) that on the 27th of December, 1907, the judge below, exceeding his jurisdiction, granted Simeon Nengasca, the protesting party, remedies which he had not asked for in his protest, and rendered judgment in the matter, holding that the said Nengasca was the president elect, and so proclaimed him, and that by virtue of said decision and proclamation, the latter took possession of said office on the 6th of January, 1908; (6) that nothing has been alleged in the protest, nor any evidence offered at the trial to show the complicity of Alberto Lagahit in the, fraud supposed to have been committed by the election inspectors, nor even that the said Alberto had presented his candidacy or allowed the same to be presented for the office of municipal president of Aloguisan, but that notwithstanding, the judge below has sentenced the petitioner herein to pay Simeon Nengasca the sum of P150 as costs, and has already ordered the execution of said portion of the judgment and attached his property in order to satisfy the same;

(2) Simeon Nengasca is recognized by the court as president elect at the elections held on the 5th day of November, 1907, at the municipality of Aloguisan for the office of municipal president; (3) the court orders that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the sum of P150, of which P20 shall be for compensation to the stenographer, P40 for compensation to the commissioner, and the balance for fees of the lawyer and other costs and expenses.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Inasmuch as the original appeal now at issue is solely directed to inquire into the regularity of certain judicial proceedings in so far as they refer to the powers and jurisdiction of the lower court acting thereon, the provision in the election law determining the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance with respect to contested elections is here transcribed.<br\/><blockquote>\"SECTION 27.\u00a0 <i>Election contests<\/i>.-* * * Contests in all elections for the determination of which provision has not been made otherwise shall be heard by the Court of First Instance having jurisdiction in the judicial district in which the election was held, upon motion by any candidate voted for at such election, which motion must be made within two weeks after the election, and such court shall have exclusive and final jurisdiction and shall forthwith cause the registry lists and all ballots used at such election to be brought before it and examined, and to appoint the necessary officers therefor and to fix their compensation, which shall be payable in the first instance out of the provincial treasury, and to issue its mandamus directed to the boards of canvassers to correct its canvass in accordance with the facts as found.\u00a0 If in any case the court shall determine that no person was lawfully elected, it shall forthwith so certify to the Governor-General, who shall order a special election to fill the office or offices in question as hereinbefore provided.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In consequence of the protest the court below appointed a commissioner to hear and record the necessary evidence, and after the testimony of witnesses had been taken, the court rendered the findings above stated.<br\/><br\/>According to the provision of law cited and transcribed above the second of these findings is not within the jurisdiction of the lower court.\u00a0 The law does not authorize the court to recognize any particular candidate as the president-elect.\u00a0 Therefore said finding should be reversed.\u00a0 The third finding in connection with the costs is based on the following provision of the law:<br\/><blockquote>\"If the party paying such expenses and costs shall be successful they shall be taxed by the court and entered and be collectible as a judgment against the defeated party.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Whether or not the court below acted rightly in considering the other candidate as the \"adverse party\" and the party defeated in the proceedings, is not a matter on which action may be taken by this court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 It is evident that it was a matter within the jurisdiction of the court below to tax the \"adverse party\" with the costs.\u00a0\u00a0 The remedy of <i>certiorari<\/i> is, therefore, not available, as the purpose thereof is to prevent and remedy extralimitations of jurisdiction and authority, not to correct errors in decisions or mistakes of law, which are proper subjects for appeal and cassation.<br\/><br\/>The first finding is perfectly in accordance with the provision of the law.\u00a0 The court below in deciding upon the protest against the contested election for president of Aloguisan said:\u00a0 \"The court believes that the majority of the electors at the past election voted in favor of the petitioner, Simeon Nengasca.\"\u00a0 Whether or not this opinion of the court below is proper, can not be the subject of review by this court.\u00a0\u00a0 It is a decision which is within the jurisdiction of the lower court, as conferred by law.<br\/><br\/>As a result of this opinion of the court below, and in compliance with the provision of the law, the judgment should have been: \"Let a writ of mandamus be issued against the board of canvassers requiring the board to correct its canvass in accordance with the facts as found.\"<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth we decide:\u00a0 that the order of the Court of First Instance of Cebu recognizing Nengasca as president-elect at the elections in the municipality of Aloguisan, in said province, should be, and is hereby annulled for the reason that it is not within the jurisdiction of the said court to recognize or proclaim a president in a contested election; that it is unnecessary to make any ruling as to the costs; and that with respect to and as a consequence of the first finding of the court below, that court should issue a writ of mandamus directed to the board of canvassers of the municipality of Aloguisan requiring the board to correct its canvass in accordance with the facts as found by the said court.\u00a0 No special ruling as to costs is made.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Wlllard<\/i>, and <i>Tracey, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

No. 4362, October 19, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>THE INSULAR GOVERNMENT, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, <i>VS.<\/i> DOROTEO NICO ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">From the record it appears that on or about the 5th of September, 1905, certain inspectors of the Internal Revenue Department made an inspection of a tobacco factory in the city of Manila which belonged to the defendant Doroteo Nico.\u00a0 The defendant Doroteo Nico was present during the time the inspection took place.\u00a0 As a result of said inspection it\u00a0 appeared that the said defendant had manufactured, solid, or removed tobacco for domestic consumption from his factory at various times between January 1, 1905, and September 5, 1905, without properly marking or branding the packages thereof and without invoicing it and prepaying the taxes due thereon.\u00a0 In thus selling and removing tobacco from his factory without invoicing it and without prepaying the taxes thereon, he violated the provisions of subparagraphs (d), (e), and (g) of section 28, as well as the provisions of sections 36, 101, and 107 of Act No, 1189 of the United States Philippine Commission.<br\/><br\/>The acts of the defendant in so removing and selling tobacco without properly marking or branding the packages and without prepaying the taxes due thereon, also violated the rules and regulations of the Department of Internal Revenue.<br\/><br\/>The said inspection showed clearly that, after making all due allowance for losses and waste and computing the lowest tax on the difference between the amount of tobacco purchased by the defendant Doroteo Nico from January 1, 1905, to September 5, 1905, and that accounted for by him, the taxes due and unpaid upon said difference were found by the Collector of Internal Revenue to be P367.20.<br\/><br\/>Upon the report of the inspector, as above indicated, the Collector of Internal Revenue, in consideration of the provisions of section 33 of Act No. 1189, recommended that the defendant Doroteo Nico be fined administratively for said violation of the law in the sum of P100, and also that said defendant be required to pay the taxes due upon the tobacco so illegally removed from his factory, amounting to P367.20.<br\/><br\/>This recommendation of the Collector of Internal Revenue was forwarded to the Hon. Henry C. Ide, then Secretary of Finance and Justice, for his approval, in accordance with said section 33.\u00a0 Later, and upon the 9th of January, 1906, the recommendation of the said Collector was duly approved by the Secretary of Finance and Justice.\u00a0 Notice of this recommendation of the Collector of Internal Revenue as approved by the Secretary of Finance and Justice was duly given to the defendant and his bondsmen.\u00a0 The notice given to the defendant and his bondsmen contained a full statement of the facts upon which the said fine was imposed, together with the reasons why the taxes of P367.20 should be paid, and required of the defendant and his bondsmen the payment of the sum of P467.20.<br\/><br\/>In reply to this notice the defendant wrote to the Collector of Internal Revenue a letter in which he attempted to explain the shortage in his supply of tobacco which the inspector had found on or about the 5th of September, 1905. In this letter the defendant furnished an invoice of tobacco on hand covering the period from January 17, 1905, until January 19, 1906.\u00a0 It will be noted that the defendant includes six or eight months not included within the period covered by the inspector.\u00a0 Whether the defendant had made up the deficiency which the inspector discovered between the 5th of September, 1905, and the 19th of January, 1906, is not a question which can be considered in this present action.\u00a0 The proof clearly shows and the defendant does not deny the fact that there was a shortage in the tobacco which he had purchased and sold prior to the 5th of September, 1905.<br\/><br\/>Under the provisions of section 54 of Act No. 1189 the defendant was given the right to appeal from the decision of the Collector of Internal Revenue, as approved by the Secretary of Finance and Justice, to the Court of First Instance, within a period of ten days from the time of the notice of the imposition of the fine by the Collector of Internal Revenue, under the provisions of said Act.\u00a0 The defendant did not appeal.\u00a0 Neither did his bondsmen.\u00a0 Had the defendant appealed\u00a0 from the order of the Collector of Internal Revenue to the Court of First Instance within a period of\u00a0 ten days, he might have then, in that action, shown to the Court of First Instance that the inspector in making his inspection had actually made a mistake and that there was no shortage in the tobacco which he had purchased and sold without invoicing and paying the taxes upon the same.\u00a0 Section 33 of said Act provides that after the fines are imposed under said section, if the same are not paid, upon demand, the payment may be enforced by a proper action in the courts.\u00a0 In accordance with the said last-quoted provisions, the Collector of Internal Revenue, upon the 22d of March, commenced an action against the defendant and his bondsmen, for the purpose of collecting the amount of taxes found to be due, together with the fine imposed administratively by the Collector.<br\/><br\/>After hearing all of the evidence adduced during the trial, the lower court found that the defendant and his bondsmen were liable to pay to the Collector of Internal Revenue the sum of P467.30, and rendered a judgment against them and in favor of the plaintiff for that amount, with costs.\u00a0 From that judgment the defendants appealed to this court and made the following assignments of error.<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"I.\u00a0 The court below erred in overruling the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to specify in his complaint the facts that constitute a violation of Act No, 1189.<br\/><br\/>\"II.\u00a0 The court below erred in not admitting at the trial any evidence tending to the defense of the defendants, unless for the purpose of showing that the administrative decision was rendered by means of fraud, or with lack of jurisdiction on the part of the administrative authority and in holding the administrative approval in the premises to be final.<br\/><br\/>\"III.\u00a0 The court below erred in sentencing the defendants to pay the Insular Government the sum of P467.20 with the costs, without considering the merits of the case.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>With reference to the first assignment of error above noted, the record shows that before the defendants answered the complaint they presented a motion in the lower court, asking that the parties be required to specify more in detail the grounds or facts upon which they relied.\u00a0 This motion the lower court, upon a full consideration, denied, deciding that the facts stated in the complaint fully complied with the provisions of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.<br\/><br\/>Upon an examination of the complaint, we are satisfied that the lower court committed no error in denying the motion.\u00a0 The facts set out in the complaint were sufficiently plain and full to give the\u00a0 defendant a full understanding of the cause of action presented against him.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the second assignment of error above noted, the lower court decided that, inasmuch as the defendants did not appeal from the order of the Collector of Internal Revenue, as approved by the Secretary of Finance and Justice, that the only question which the court could consider in the present action was whether or not the Collector of Internal Revenue, in relation with the Secretary of Finance and Justice, had (a) jurisdiction to impose the fine in question and (b) whether any fraud was\u00a0 committed in the imposition of such fine.<br\/><br\/>Section 33 of Act No. 1189 expressly confers upon the Collector of\u00a0 Internal Revenue, under the method provided for therein, the right to impose fines for a violation of the provisions of said law.\u00a0 Section 54 of said Act gives the parties upon whom the fine\" is imposed the right to appeal to the courts from such order of the\u00a0 Collector.\u00a0 Section 54, in case the person fined appeals, provides for a hearing.\u00a0 It was the evident intention of the Legislature, by providing for this\u00a0 hearing, to give to the party a right to show by proper evidence that the Collector of Internal Revenue had made a mistake in the imposition of the fine, as well as whatever other reasons he\u00a0 might have showing that the fine should not have been imposed.\u00a0 In other\" words, in this appeal made by the party fined, the whole question with reference to the facts upon which the fine was imposed might have been presented to the court.\u00a0 The law further provides that if the person fined does not appeal from the order of the Collector of Internal Revenue imposing the fine, that the Collector shall commence an action in the proper court for the purpose of collecting the fine.\u00a0 In this action by the Collector, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the only questions which the court has a right to investigate are whether or not the Collector had jurisdiction to impose the fine, and whether he had committed any fraud in so doing.<br\/><br\/>The law expressly gave the Collector of Internal Revenue the right to impose a fine for a violation of the law administratively.\u00a0 It is a universal principle that where power or jurisdiction is delegated to any public officer or tribunal over a subject-matter, and its exercise is confided to his or their discretion, the acts so done are binding and valid as to the subject-matter.\u00a0 The only questions which can arise between an individual claiming a right under the acts done and the public or any person denying its validity, are whether such officer or tribunal had jurisdiction to do the particular act, and whether any fraud was committed in the doing of the act.\u00a0 All other questions are settled by the decision of the officer or tribunal upon whom the duty is imposed.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Arredondo, 6 Peters, 691, 729; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> California and Oregon Land Co., 148 U. S., 31; Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway Company <i>vs.<\/i> Backus, 154 U. S., 421.)<br\/><br\/>The lower court committed no error, therefore, in the present action, in confining the trial of the cause to the questions of the jurisdiction of the Collector of Internal Revenue to impose the fine and whether or not any fraud was committed in the imposition of such fine.<br\/><br\/>During the trial of the cause there was no effort made on the part of the defendant to show either that the Collector of Internal Revenue had no jurisdiction to impose the fine in question, nor that he had committed any fraud in so imposing said fine.<br\/><br\/>With these conclusions, we deem it unnecessary to discuss the third assignment of error above noted.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above stated, the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

GAVIERES.\"<br\/><\/div><\/blockquote>This case relates only to seven of the tickets mentioned in this contract.<br\/><br\/>The only evidence introduced by the plaintiff was the contract itself.\u00a0 The only evidence introduced by the defendant, in addition to a short statement by himself was parts of the record in case No. 5133 in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, which was a special proceeding for the settlement of the estate of Luisa Pe\u00f1a, deceased.<br\/><br\/>The court below decided\u00a0 the case in favor of the defendant, and the plaintiff has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The contract presented by the plaintiff showed, <i>prima facie<\/i>, a right in her to the possession of the tickets, whether the contract be considered as a contract of sale with the right to repurchase, or a contract of pledge, for in either case she had possession of the tickets and even in the case of pledge was entitled to retain that possession until the debt due her had been paid.\u00a0 But the defendant claims that this <i>prima facie<\/i> case made by the plaintiff has been destroyed by the proceeding had in case No. 5133, and that in that case a decision was rendered in his favor which conclusively adjudicated the rights of the parties as to these tickets.\u00a0 The plaintiff was brought into that proceeding by a petition filed therein by the defendant as attorney for the administrator and heirs of Luisa Pe\u00f1a on the 31st of July, 1907.\u00a0 This petition alleged that the 31 pawn tickets were delivered to the plaintiff to secure the payment of 970.90 pesos and that the administrator and heirs had offered to redeem the same, but that the plaintiff had refused to allow such redemption and had sold or was about to sell the tickets.\u00a0 The prayer of this petition was as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Wherefore this representation asks that this honorable court issue an order directing the said Vicenta Franco immediately to show cause why she should not deliver said pawn tickets to the estate or into court pending the settlement of this matter and accept the sum for which they are given as security and for such other and further relief as may be just and proper.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On the same day the court made an order, a part of which was as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"After a careful consideration of said\u00a0 case, it is hereby ordered that Do\u00f1a Vicenta Franco shall appear before this court on the 31st day of July, 1907, at 3 p. m., to answer the aforesaid petition of the administrator, and to deliver to the court, in case it be so ordered at that time, the pawn tickets described in the petition of the above-mentioned administrator.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The court below said that this proceeding by which the plaintiff was brought into case No. 5133 was a proceeding had under section 709 of the Code of Civil Procedure, by virtue of which a person suspected of having property belonging to the estate of a deceased person may be cited and examined in regard to such property, and added, \"it would be strange indeed if the court after finding as a result of such examination that the property belonged to the estate could not so declare.\"<br\/><br\/>This view of the court as to the construction of section 709 was erroneous as has been decided by this court in the case of Chanco <i>vs<\/i>. Madrilejos<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> (7 Off. Gaz., 230).\u00a0 In that case, speaking of section 709, the court said-<br\/><blockquote>\"It was said in the argument by the plaintiff that no question of title to property is involved in this proceeding, the defendant not claiming to be entitled to the possession of the documents referred to in the petition.\u00a0 But if the plaintiff's theory in regard to section 709 is correct, the court would be bound in a case where the defendant admitted his possession of personal property other than documents and papers and claimed to be the owner thereof to try that litigated question in this summary proceeding and determine what the rights of the parties were to the property involved.\u00a0 It will be observed that the section nowhere expressly gives the court any such power.\u00a0 The usual way\u00a0 of determining the rights of contending parties to the ownership of property is by the institution of an ordinary action.\u00a0 This is true whether the property in question belongs to the estate of a deceased person or not.\u00a0 That it was contemplated that this ordinary proceeding should be followed in cases relating to property of a deceased person embezzled or alienated by a third person, is apparent from section 711,\" and it was held in that case that, after the party cited had appeared, had been examined under oath, and her testimony had been taken down in writing and filed in the clerk's office, the proceeding was ended, and this court refused to issue a mandamus to the judge to proceed further with the case and receive evidence upon the disputed questions.<br\/><\/blockquote>That decision determines that the power of the court in case No. 5133, so far as the plaintiff, a stranger to that proceeding, was concerned, was limited to causing her to appear and be examined.\u00a0 It had no jurisdiction in that probate proceeding to determine who was the owner of the property.\u00a0 That question should have been determined in an ordinary action brought by the administrator against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>It is claimed, however, that the plaintiff voluntarily appeared in that proceeding, submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the court, and asked that the court decide that she was the owner of the tickets.\u00a0 What was done on the 31st day of July, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, at which time the plaintiff was ordered to be present, does not appear.\u00a0 It seems that some order was then made directing her to deliver the pawn tickets to the clerk of the court, but such order does not appear in the record sent to this court.<br\/><br\/>On the 16th day of August, 1907, the plaintiff appeared by counsel in proceeding No. 5133, and presented an answer to the petition of the administrator and the heirs.\u00a0 In this answer she set forth fully ail the facts relating to the transaction between her and Luisa Pe\u00f1a, deceased, and the heirs and administrator.\u00a0 The prayer of her answer was as follows;<br\/><blockquote>\"Therefore, we pray the court that the petition of the administrator and the heirs of the estate of Do\u00f1a Luisa Pe\u00f1a that the pawn tickets in question be delivered to the court, be denied with costs against the plaintiff.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It will be seen that she did not ask for any affirmative relief.\u00a0 She simply asked that the proceeding be dismissed.\u00a0 The proceeding being one apparently under section 709, she was bound to appear and make some answer.\u00a0 Her appearance can not be considered as a consent that her right to the ownership of this property be tried in that proceeding.\u00a0 Neither do we think that her answer can be so considered for she merely asked that the proceeding be dismissed.<br\/><br\/>On the 23d of November, 1907, the judge filed a decision relating to the matter.\u00a0 It does not appear from that decision, nor from any other evidence before us that the plaintiff appeared at the trial or took any part in case No. 5133 after the presentation by her of her answer on the 16th day of August, 1907.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is therefore ordered and adjudged that the heirs to said estate, or the administrator thereof, are entitled to possession and ownership of the following described pawn tickets now in the hands of the clerk of the court upon payment to Vicenta Franco of the amount found to be due thereon, as hereinbefore stated, viz: 25650, 25654, 25660, 25664, 25668, 25679, and 25684.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Under the view which we have taken of the proceeding, the court had no power to render such a judgment, because in that probate proceeding it had no power to determine the rights of third persons, strangers to the estate, to property claimed to be owned by them.\u00a0 Whether the judgment would have been conclusive against the plaintiff if she had voluntarily appeared and submitted the matter to the decision of the court is a question which we are not called upon now to decide, but we hold that what was done by her was not an agreement that the court might decide the controversy<br\/>between the parties in that proceeding.<br\/><br\/>There is another view of the case which leads to the same result.\u00a0 It will be seen that the court below did not decide that the administrator or the heirs were entitled to the immediate\u00a0 possession of the property.\u00a0 It only decided that they would be entitled to that possession when they, had paidthe plaintiff what was due to her upon her claim.\u00a0 There is no evidence in the case to show that this sum has ever been paid.\u00a0 The court below held that it had been paid, or that it did not appear that it had not been paid, evidently holding that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to show that such payment had not been made.\u00a0 This is contrary to the rulings of this court.\u00a0 It has always been held here that the burden of showing payment is\u00a0 upon the defendant.\u00a0 Moreover, no claim was made in the proceeding in case No. 5133 to the effect that this debt had been paid.\u00a0 The claim simply was that the heirs and administrator had offered to pay it.\u00a0 The judge himself must necessarily have found that the debt had not been paid, otherwise he would not have made the order that he did.\u00a0 The mere fact that the document on which the plaintiff relies was found among the records in case No. 5133 is no proof that it came from the possession of the defendant, and no proof that the plaintiff was paid.<br\/><br\/>On the 9th of October, 1907, the court made an order in case No. 5133 which is as follows:<br\/><br\/>This ease is now before the court by virtue of certain pawn tickets of the <i>Monte de Piedad<\/i> which it is alleged are the property of this intestate estate and are now deposited with the clerk of the court:<br\/><blockquote>\"It appearing that the term of said tickets expires today, and that it is\u00a0 necessary that the same be renewed by paying their interest;<br\/><br\/>\"It is ordered that the clerk be and is hereby authorized to present said pawn tickets Nos. 25668, 25654, 25650, 25684, 25679, 25664, and 25660, and renew them by paying the corresponding interest, said tickets being subject to a lien in favor of the person who advanced the money to pay the interest.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It appears that 86 pesos were furnished by the defendant O'Brien for the purposes named in that order and that the tickets had been\u00a0 renewed.<br\/><br\/>On the 15th of February, 1908, the court directed the clerk to deliver the pawn tickets to the defendant O'Brien upon his filing a bond with the court.\u00a0 This was done and the pawn tickets are now in the possession of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>All of these proceedings relating to the payment of the interest and the delivery of the tickets to the defendant were had in a case to which the plaintiff was not a party.\u00a0 She is in no way bound by these orders.<br\/><br\/>The judgment must be reversed.\u00a0 It seems probable, however, from what appears in the answer of the plaintiff in case No. 5133, that the plaintiff may have extended the time for the repurchase of the tickets and that the defendant may be able to prove this fact by evidence other than that presented at the trial already had and to prove that within the time thus extended an offer of repurchase was made.\u00a0 A new trial should be granted to give the defendant an opportunity for making this showing.<br\/><br\/>The judgment is reversed and a new trial ordered.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and Carson, JJ.,

all contrary \"to law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>At the trial the accused did not offer any evidence, and in this instance he has limited his defense to alleging that the witnesses for the prosecution contradicted themselves.\u00a0 A careful examination of the testimony of the said witnesses shows at once that the contradictions alleged in the defendant's brief are more apparent than real, apart from the fact that, as they refer to most trifling and accidental details they could not, in any case, affect the essential facts attested by said witnesses.\u00a0 Their testimony has fully established the fact that the accused, without the corresponding license required by law, sold opium to Lucio Sanchez on a certain night in the month of February, 1908.<br\/><br\/>In view of the above the court below found the accused guilty of the violation of section 15 of Act No. 1761, and sentenced him to the penalty of one year's imprisonment and to pay a fine of P2,000, and in case of insolvency to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of P2.50 per day, not to exceed four months, and costs.\u00a0 The said section 15 reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 No person shall import, cook, or prepare opium, or engage in the business of purchasing1 or selling opium or of dealing or trafficking therein, unless he shall have first secured from the Collector of Internal Revenue a license to transact such business and shall have paid the license tax prescribed by this Act.\u00a0 Crude opium shall not be sold to any person who is not a duly licensed wholesale dealer, and then only subject to all the provisions of section five\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\" (<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than five hundred pesos nor more than two thousand pesos, or by imprisonment for a period of not more than one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The Attorney-General maintains in his brief that instead of section 15, applied by the court below, the accused should be sentenced under section 5 of said Act No. 1761 which provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 It shall be unlawful to sell, transfer, give, or deliver opium to any person except to a duly licensed and practicing physician, pharmacist, or second-class pharmacist, or a duly licensed dispensator of opium, or duly registered confirmed user of opium in a licensed opium dispensary for consumption therein only, and in accordance with the provisions of this Act:\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 Any person violating the provisions of the preceding subsection shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand pesos, or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court:\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"<br\/><\/blockquote>As may be seen, both sections contain a prohibition to sell opium, but their wording is certainly quite different.\u00a0 The prohibition in section 15 is absolute to all persons who are not provided with the corresponding license to sell opium, without taking into account the condition of the purchaser.\u00a0 Under this section no one can sell opium to another unless such a license has been previously obtained.\u00a0 On the other hand, the prohibition in section 5 is limited to sales made to any person who is not a physician, a pharmacist, an authorized seller of opium, or a duly registered consumer thereof.\u00a0 This limitation presupposes, in our opinion, a license to sell opium, because without it, it would be unlawful to effect any sale of the drug, even to physicians, pharmacists, dealers, or confirmed users of opium.\u00a0 As we understand it, section 15 makes a license a necessary and indispensable requisite in order that a person may engage in the sale of opium; while section 5 points out the only class of persons to whom opium may be sold even under such a license.\u00a0 According to this interpretation, it follows that the provision of the section first cited is applicable to any person who sells opium to no matter who the purchaser may be; and that of the last named, that is, section 5, to any person who, holding a license, sells opium to persons other than those expressly mentioned therein.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the trial judge acted rightly in applying the said section 15 in the present case which deals with the sale of opium by a person who held no license therefor.<br\/><br\/>Taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, the penalty imposed by the judgment appealed from is hereby reduced to two months' imprisonment and a fine of P500, or subsidiary imprisonment which shall not exceed twenty days at the rate of P2,50 per day in case of insolvency in the payment of the fine.<br\/><br\/>With this modification the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the accused.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

GO-SIACO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>WILLARD, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The defendant has made a motion that he be admitted to bail pending his appeal in this court.<br\/><br\/>The proceeding is one brought under the provisions of Act No. 702 relating to the deportation of Chinese laborers found within the Islands without the certificate required by that law.\u00a0 Section 4 of that Act is in part as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any Chinese laborer within the limits of the Philippine Islands who shall neglect, fail, or refuse to obtain within the time prescribed by section four of the Act of Congress of the United States referred to in section one of this Act, the certificate of registration by this Act provided to be issued, and who shall be found within the Philippine Islands without such certificate of registration after such time has elapsed, may be arrested upon warrant issued by the Court of First Instance of the province or by the justice's court of the municipality returnable before said Court of First Instance, by any customs official, police, Constabulary, or other peace officer of the Philippine Islands and brought before any judge of a Court of First Instance in the Islands, whose duty it shall be to order that such Chinese laborer be deported from the Philippine Islands, either to China or the country from whence he came, unless he shall affirmatively establish clearly and to the satisfaction of such judge, by at least one credible witness other than Chinese, that although lawfully in the Philippine Islands at and ever since the passage of this Act he has been unable by reason of accident, sickness, or other unavoidable cause to procure the certificate within the time prescribed by law,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The defendant was arrested on the 24th of July, 1908, in the Province of Tarlac and brought before a justice of the peace, who remitted him, together with the proceedings taken by the justice in the matter, to the Court of First Instance, where, on the 2d day of September, 1908, a complaint was filed against him by the provincial fiscal for violation of section 4 of Act No. 702.\u00a0 A trial was had in that court and on the 29th of September, 1908, a judgment was rendered ordering the deportation of the defendant from the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 From that judgment he appealed to this court and his appeal is now pending herein.<br\/><br\/>It appeared in the court below that the defendant was born in the Province of Pampanga on the 8th day of September, 1876; that his father was a Chinese and his mother a Filipina woman, who were legally married and that he is their legitimate son; that he left the Islands in 1892 and returned in 1896, and has lived here ever since, and that his father died many years ago.<br\/><br\/>We are not called upon to decide the case upon its merits, the only question being whether the defendant shall be admitted to bail until that decision is made.\u00a0 The Solicitor-General claims that bail can not be allowed, citing section 5 of the Act of Congress of May 5, 1902 [1892] (Off. Gaz. of March 4, 1903, p. 145.)\u00a0 That section is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Sec. 5.\u00a0 That after the passage of this Act on an application to any judge or court of the United States in the first instance for a writ of habeas corpus by a Chinese person seeking to land in the United States to whom that privilege has been denied, no bail shall be allowed and such application shall be heard and determined promptly without unnecessary delay.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This section by its terms has no application to the case of a Chinese person who is already in the country and whom the authorities are attempting to deport.<br\/><br\/>The Solicitor-General cites also the Act of Congress of November 3, 1893 (Off. Gaz. of March 4, 1903, p. 146; 28 U. S. Stat. at L., 7.)\u00a0 In section 2 the words \"laborer\" or \"laborers\" is defined in the first paragraph.\u00a0 In the second paragraph the word \"merchant\" is defined.\u00a0 The third and fourth paragraphs are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Where an application is made by a Chinaman for entrance into the United States on the ground that he was formerly engaged in this country as a merchant, he shall establish by the testimony of two credible witnesses other than Chinese the fact that he conducted such business as hereinbefore defined for at least one year before his departure from the United States, and that during such year he was not engaged in the performance of any manual labor, except such as was necessary in the conduct of his business as such merchant and in default of such proof shall be refused landing.<br\/><br\/>\"Such order of deportation shall be executed by the United States marshal of the district within which such order is made, and he shall execute the same with all convenient dispatch; and pending the execution of such order such Chinese person shall remain in the custody of the United States marshal and shall not be admitted to bail.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The location of this last clause in the section might make it doubtful as to whether it referred to the order of deportation mentioned in section 1 of the Act or to the order refusing permission to land, mentioned in the clause immediately preceding it, but we think a fair construction of the whole Act indicates that it refers to the order of deportation mentioned in the first section, and as such it would apply to a case of deportation.<br\/><br\/>The question, however, still remains, whether the paragraph was intended to apply to the order as soon as it was made by the Commissioner or by the district court, if proceedings were first had before the latter, or whether it was intended to apply only after the first order, when made by the Commissioner or the court, had been affirmed on appeal, if an appeal was taken.\u00a0 That an appeal lies in cases of deportation, even to the Supreme Court of the United States is well settled.\u00a0 (United States, petitioner, 194 U. S., 194; Liu Hop Fong <i>vs<\/i>. United States, 209 U. S., 453.)\u00a0 We see nothing in the Act which necessarily requires us to say that bail can not be allowed pending such appeal.\u00a0 The phrase \"and he shall execute the same with all convenient dispatch,\" on the contrary, indicates that it applies only when the order is in such condition that it can be executed at once, which would not be the case where an appeal had been taken and a supersedeas bond given.<br\/><br\/>The Solicitor-General further claims that proceedings under Act No. 702 and similar Acts in the United States have there been held not to be criminal proceedings, and that the only provisions relating to bail in force here being provisions that relate to criminal cases, they are not applicable to this case.\u00a0 Among the cases cited in support of this proposition is the case of Fong Yue Ting <i>vs<\/i>. The United States (149 U. S., 698).\u00a0 This is the case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held for the first time that the Deportation Act was valid.\u00a0 One of the principal contentions against the Act was that it deprived the defendant of the rights which were granted to every one accused of a crime.\u00a0 The court said, at page 730:<br\/><blockquote>\"The proceeding before a United States judge, as provided for in section 6 of the Act of 1892, is in no proper sense a trial and sentence for a crime or offense.\u00a0 It is simply the ascertainment, by appropriate and lawful means, of the fact whether the conditions exist upon which Congress has enacted that an alien of this class may remain within the country.\u00a0 The order of deportation is not a punishment for crime.\u00a0 It is not a banishment, in the sense in which that word is often applied to the expulsion of a citizen from his country by way of punishment.\u00a0 It is but a method of enforcing the return to his own country of an alien who has not complied with the conditions upon the performance of which the Government of the nation, acting within its constitutional authority and through the proper departments, has determined that his continuing to reside here shall depend.\u00a0 He has not, therefore, been deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; and the provisions of the Constitution securing the right of trial by jury, and prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures, and cruel and unusual punishments, have no application.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It will be seen that this declaration is not inconsistent with the view that while the proceeding is not a trial or sentence for a crime or offense, it may in so far use the machinery of the criminal law as to admit of application the provisions in such law relating to bail.\u00a0 It is to be noted, moreover, that in this very case, which however went to the Supreme Court not by appeal from the order of deportation but by appeal from an order denying a writ of <i>habeas corpus<\/i>, the petitioner was admitted to bail pending his appeal to the Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Low Foon Yin <i>vs<\/i>. The United States Immigration Commission (145 Fed. Rep., 791), Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, the question was, whether the defendant could be compelled to testify in the proceeding and it was held, citing the case of Fong Yue Ting against the United States, that it was not so far a criminal proceeding as to exonerate the defendant from the obligation of testifying.\u00a0 In the case of <i>In re<\/i> Lam Jung Sing (150 Fed. Rep., 608), United States District Court, it was held that the proceeding was not so far criminal in its nature as to prevent the admission on the part of the defendant of depositions of witnesses taken out of court.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, in the case of The United States <i>vs<\/i>. Lee Ching Goon, supreme court of Arizona, March 28,1900 (60 Pacific Rep., 692), the question was, whether the United States had a right to appeal from an order of the Commissioner refusing to deport a Chinese.\u00a0 It was held that it had not.\u00a0 The court said:\u00a0 \"The proceeding in this case is special and statutory.\u00a0 It is analogous to a criminal action in the respect that the machinery is criminal.\"<br\/><br\/>None of these cases, however, really touch upon the right of the defendant to be admitted to bail.\u00a0 The case of Ah How <i>vs<\/i>. The United States (193 U. S., 65), was an appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court confirming the decision of a Commissioner adjudging that the appellant be removed from the United States to China.\u00a0 The court affirmed the judgment, saying at the end of the opinion:<br\/><blockquote>\"We are asked to express an opinion as to the right of the appellants to give bail pending their appeal, but that now is a moot point.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case of Liu Hop Fong <i>vs<\/i>. The United States (209 U. S., 453), the defendant appealed from the order of the Commissioner deporting him and was admitted to bail pending his appeal.\u00a0 In that case the court said:\u00a0 \"It is a serious thing to arrest a Chinaman who, as in this case, has been in this country a number of years, lawfully admitted upon a certificate complying with the treaty, and order his deportation without giving him a full opportunity to assert his rights before a competent court.\"<br\/><br\/>If bail is refused in this case, we do not think it can be said that the defendant has had a full opportunity to assert his rights.\u00a0 He was arrested, as has been said, on the 24th of July, 1908.\u00a0 He has been in confinement ever since that time and if bail is refused will have to remain a prisoner until the decision of his case in this court.\u00a0 If our decision be adverse to him, he will have the right to remove the case to the Supreme Court of the United States and will have to remain in jail during the pendency of that appeal.\u00a0 Rather than endure confinement for that length of time, he might well say that he would abandon his appeal and surrender the rights which the law has given to him.<br\/><br\/>Upon principle, we see no reason why bail should not be allowed in this class of cases.\u00a0 As is said by the Supreme Court, the defendant has committed no crime.\u00a0 In this particular case the defendant was born in this country, has lived here for more than 35 years and is now living here with his mother, a native of the Islands.\u00a0 There is no reason to think that his being at large will be any menace to the people in the locality where he resides, nor is there any reason to believe that his attendance at court to abide the judgment which may be entered against him can not be secured by the giving of bail as in ordinary cases.\u00a0 To refuse him bail is to treat him as a person is treated who has committed the most serious crime known to the law, and while we do not intend to say that this is a criminal proceeding, we do say that some of the machinery used for making the investigation required by Act No. 702 is the machinery of the criminal law, and to it are applicable those provisions of General Orders, No. 58, relating to bail.<br\/><br\/>The motion is granted, and upon being notified of this decision, the Attorney-General will indicate the amount of the bond which in his opinion the defendant should furnish, and upon the filing and approval of the bond in such amount as may be fixed by the court, after hearing the Attorney-General, an order will be made releasing the defendant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Tracey, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 15th of March, 1906, Juan Brusas filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance of Ambos Camarines, alleging that by virtue of a writ of execution issued by the justice of the peace of the town of Buhi, in said province, the deputy sheriff on August 18, 1903, levied upon two hemp fields owned by\u00a0 him, both situated in the <i>sitio<\/i> of Cambasan, in said municipality, each 400 <i>brazas<\/i> in circumference, the respective boundaries of which are described in the complaint; that on the 16th of November of said year, the deputy sheriff sold the said properties at public auction for the sum of 240 pesos to the sole bidder, Juan Garcia Vega, who, on the 24th of the same month assigned all his rights and title to said lands for the same sum to Sinforoso Dondis, and the latter in turn transferred them for an equal amount to Eutiquio Infante, the defendant herein; that on or about the 12th of June of the following year, 1904, or about seven months more or less afterwards, the plaintiff, availing himself of his right of redemption under the law, informed the deputy sheriff that he desired to redeem the said properties; that the sheriff thereupon wrote to the defendant to admit the redemption, and for this purpose the plaintiff, carrying with him the letter, called at the house of the defendant and offered to pay him the redemption money with legal interest thereon and the expenses incurred in the attachment proceedings, but the defendant, without any valid reason therefor, refused to admit the redemption, and unlawfully retained the lands against the will and to the prejudice of the plaintiff; that the latter for said reason has suffered damages and losses of the fruits which he has not received to the extent of P900, value of 450 <i>arrobas<\/i> of hemp unlawfully harvested by the defendant.\u00a0 Therefore, the plaintiff prayed that judgment be entered against the defendant, compelling him to admit the redemption of the said properties, and to pay the said amount to the plaintiff, deducting therefrom the sum of 240 pesos, Mexican currency, as redemption money, the interest for seven months from the 16th of November, 1903, to June 12, 1904, and the expenses occasioned by the attachment proceedings, and costs.<br\/><br\/>After excepting to the action of the court in overruling his demurrer, the defendant answered the foregoing complaint and denied each and all of the allegations therein contained, with the exception of those he expressly admitted in his answer.\u00a0 He admits paragraph 1 of the complaint, but states that the boundaries of the properties in litigation are not such as are described in the complaint, but those stated in the answer.\u00a0 He also admitted paragraphs 2 and 3.\u00a0 As a special defense he alleged that although it is true that on the\u00a0 13th of June, 1904, the plaintiff called at the house of the defendant in Buhi, carrying with him money wrapped up in a piece of cloth for the purpose, as he said, of redeeming the properties in question, the redemption was not accomplished because the plaintiff did not have with him the documents required by law, and primarily because the plaintiff's wife, who shortly thereafter arrived at his house, forcibly took from her husband the packet of money, and, carrying it with her, left in anger.\u00a0 Her husband was unable to give a satisfactory explanation of her conduct; he therefore took his leave and did not return; that in November, 1904, the period of one year allowed by law for the redemption of property, expired, and for this reason alone the defendant considered that his title to the property purchased by him had become vested, and that since January, 1905, he had made improvements thereon which cost him 9250; for these reasons he prayed that judgment be entered in his favor and against the plaintiff with costs.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence of both parties, the lower court, on the 22d of January, 1907, rendered judgment against the defendant, ordering him to return the land in question to the plaintiff, and to pay the latter the sum of P370.50, less 250 pesos, Mexican currency, or the equivalent thereof in Philippine currency, with interest thereon and costs.\u00a0 Counsel for the defendant excepted to the above judgment and gave notice of his intention to present a bill of exceptions for the purpose of appealing therefrom.\u00a0 The bill of exceptions was filed and approved by the, court below, and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The question herein is one of right of redemption by reason of the execution of a final judgment as provided by section 464 of the Code of Civil Procedure; therefore, the controversy between the parties must be adjudicated under the provisions of the said code.\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions of the Civil Code, article 1507 et seq., relating to conventional redemption, are not applicable to the present case.<br\/><br\/>On this supposition, and in view of the fact that the appellant did not move for the reopening of the case and because the evidence adduced in the first instance has not been submitted with\u00a0 the bill of exceptions, this court can not examine or review the same and will limit itself to deciding the questions of law raised\u00a0 by the appellant, accepting the facts such as they appear to have been admitted in the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, Juan Brusas, was the defendant against whom an execution was levied by virtue of a judgment rendered against him on the 18th of August, 1903, by the justice of the peace of Buhi.\u00a0 By reason of the said judgment two parcels of land owned by him were levied upon and sold at public auction on the 16th of November of said, year to the highest bidder, Juan Garcia Vega, for the sum of 240 pesos.\u00a0 The latter on the 24th of said month, sold all of his rights, title and interest in the said two parcels of land to Sinforoso Dondis, for the same amount of 240 pesos, Mexican currency, and Dondis, in turn, sold all of his rights, title and interest in the said two parcels of land to Eutiquio Infante, the defendant herein, on May 21,1904.\u00a0 When, therefore, about the 12th of June, 1904, Juan Brusas offered to redeem the two parcels of land from the last purchaser, Eutiquio Infante, and, in the latter's own house, tendered the sum of P287 with a letter from the sheriff informing him that the redemption which Brusas desired and proposed was in accordance with the law, he exercised a perfect right within the twelve months fixed by the law, and the defendant Infante could not refuse the redemption, or decline to receive the money that Brusas, in compliance with the law, tendered him for that purpose.\u00a0 These facts were considered by the trial judge as fully proven, and this court can not do otherwise than accept them, especially as the judgment can not be reviewed, and, moreover, they have not been questioned, and nothing has been proved to the contrary.<br\/><br\/>Section 464 of the Code of Civil Procedure in determining with whom lays the right of redemption enumerates:<br\/><ol><li>The judgment debtor, or his successors in interest in the whole or in any part of the property;<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>A creditor having a lien by attachment, judgment, or mortgage on the property sold, or on some part thereof, subsequent to that on which the property was sold.\u00a0 Such a creditor is termed a redemptioner.<br\/><\/li><\/ol>The defendant in his answer to the complaint alleged as special defense, that, although it is true that the plaintiff, Brusas, called at his house on the 13th of June, 1904, and for the purpose of redeeming the two parcels of land in question proffered a certain amount of money which he carried with him wrapped in a piece of cloth, the said plaintiff did not have with him, nor did he present, the documents required by law.\u00a0 Later on, in his brief filed in the second instance, the defendant added that the plaintiff had not deposited in court the value of the redemption, and that, therefore, he had not complied with the provisions of section 467 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 [Code of Civil Procedure.]<br\/><br\/>In order to demonstrate how utterly the allegation of the appellant lacks foundation, it is sufficient to refer him to the language of said section 464 of the Code of Civil Procedure wherein, as already stated, two classes of persons are enumerated as entitled to exercise the right of redemption, and they are:\u00a0 The judgment debtor and his successors in interest, and the creditor having a lien, and who, according to law, is termed the redemptioner.<br\/><br\/>The judgment debtor is entitled to redeem the property sold without further requisites than those of paying the amount paid by the purchaser and complying with the other provisions of section 465 within the twelve months fixed therein.\u00a0 It is not necessary for him to present a copy of the judgment and other documents required of the redemptioner because the right of redemption inhering in him as such judgment debtor appears in the proceedings and the documents held by the purchaser in possession, since the former was the original owner thereof and was dispossessed of it by virtue of the attachment and judgment.\u00a0 None of the provisions of sections 465 and 466 of the Code of Civil Procedure require that the judgment debtor shall present any document to prove his status as such judgment debtor entitled to redeem, nor to deposit the price thereof.<br\/><br\/>Section 467 requiring the redemptioner, that is, the second of the creditors mentioned as entitled to redeem under section 464 of the Code of Procedure, to produce the documents therein stated, refers as may be seen from the language of the aforesaid section 467, not to the judgment debtor, but to the redeeming creditor.\u00a0 The object of this provision is to prove and convince the purchaser, who is in possession of the property sold by the court, that the said creditor is entitled to redeem the same.<br\/><br\/>If it were proven that the defendant, without good reason, refused to admit the redemption of the said two parcels of land, and to accept the amount tendered therefor by the judgment debtor, the plaintiff herein, he must of course be considered as possessing them in bad faith since the 12th of June, 1904, as appears in the judgment appealed from, and the other data in the case.<br\/><br\/>For the above considerations and accepting those contained in the judgment appealed from, it is our opinion that the same should be affirmed, and we hereby affirm it with the costs against the appellant, provided, however, that the rate of interest shall be as fixed by section 465 of the Code of Procedure.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,

BROBST, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"> The defendant, James L. Brobst, and another American named Mann, were engaged in work on a mine located in the municipality of Masbate, where they gave employment to a number of native laborers.\u00a0 Mann discharged one of these laborers named Simeon Saldivar, warned him not to come back on the premises, and told the defendant not to employ him again, because he was a thief and a disturbing element with the other laborers.\u00a0 A few days afterwards, some time after 6 o'clock on the morning of the 10th of July, 1907, Saldivar in company with three or four others, went to the mine to look for work.\u00a0 The defendant, who at that time was dressing himself inside his tent, which was erected on the mining property, when he caught sight of Saldivar, ordered him off the place, exclaiming in bad Spanish, <i>\"Sigue, Vamus!\"<\/i> (Begone). Saldivar made no move to leave, and although the order was repeated, merely smiled or grinned at the defendant, where-upon the latter became enraged, took three steps toward Saldivar, and struck him a powerful blow with his closed fist on the left side, just over the lower ribs, at the point where the handle of Saldivar's bolo lay against the belt from which it was suspended.\u00a0 On being struck, Saldivar threw up his hands, staggered (<i>dio vueltas<\/i>-spun around helplessly) and without saying a word, went away in the direction of his sister's house, which stood about 200 yards (100 brazas) away, and about 100 feet up the side of a hill.\u00a0 He died as he reached the door of the house, and was buried some two or three days later.<br\/><br\/>The trial court found the defendant guilty of the crime of homicide (<i>homicidio<\/i>), marked with the extenuating circumstances, defined in subsections 3 and 7 of article 9 of the Penal Code, in that the defendant \"had no intention of committing so grave an injury as that which he inflicted,\" and that he struck\u00a0 the blow \"under such powerful excitement as would naturally produce entire loss of reason and self-control.\"\u00a0 Sentence of six years and one day of <i>prision mayor<\/i> was imposed, and from this sentence defendant appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the appellant, relying mainly on appellant's claim that he did not strike Saldivar, and that he merely pushed him lightly with the back of his open hand, and relying also on the lack of satisfactory proof of the existence of lesions or external marks of violence on the body of the deceased, contend:\u00a0 first, that the evidence fails to sustain a finding that the deceased came to his death as a result of injuries inflicted by the defendant; and, second, that even if it be a fact that the defendant, in laying his hand upon the deceased, contributed to his death, nevertheless, since the defendant had a perfect right to eject the deceased from the mining property, he can not be held criminally liable for unintentional injuries inflicted in the lawful exercise of this right.<br\/><br\/>Two witnesses, Dagapdap and Yotiga, who were standing close by at the time, swore positively that the blow was delivered with the closed fist, from the shoulder (<i>de dentro para fuera<\/i>), and that it was a hard blow; Dagapdap testifying that, <i>\"Al pegar el pu\u00f1etazo, Simeon dio vueltas, y despues se marcho\"<\/i> (when the blow was struck, Simeon staggered and afterwards went away); and Yotiga that <i>\"despuies de dar el golpe se retrocedio y levanto los brazos\"<\/i> (after the blow was struck, he backed away and threw up his arms).\u00a0 The testimony of these witnesses is clear, positive, and definite and is wholly uncontradicted, except for the improbable\u00a0 story told by the accused in his own behalf, when he testified that seeing Saldivar standing outside his tent, he told him twice to go away and then stepped up to him and pushed him lightly with the back of his hand, which came in contact with the handle of Saldivar's bolo, but not with sufficient force to push him back or do him any injury.\u00a0 If it had been necessary to use force to compel Saldivar to leave the place, it is at least highly improbable that the accused approaching him from the front would have lightly placed the back of his <i>open right<\/i> hand on Saldivar's <i>left<\/i> side, without attempting to seize him, or to compel him to give ground.<br\/><br\/>Pedro Leocampo, the only other witness called at the trial who appears to have been present when the ihcident occurred,\u00a0 corroborated the testimony of the witnesses Dagapdap and Yotiga as to all that occurred prior to the actual infliction of the blow, which he did not see.\u00a0 He testified that at the time when the accused, standing in his tent, ordered the deceased to leave, he, the witness, was eating his breakfast, with his back to the accused and the deceased; that hearing the order, he turned his head and saw the accused start toward the deceased with his arm outstretched, but that at that moment he turned away and did not see the accused actually come up to, strike or touch the deceased; that when he saw the accused approaching the deceased, the accused did not have his fist clenched, but that he could not say whether the blow was struck with the open hand or the closed fist, because at the moment when it is said the accused came up to and touched or struck the deceased, the witness's head was so turned that he could not and did not see what took place.<br\/><br\/>No evidence was introduced at the trial which in any wise tends to put in doubt the truth of the testimony of these witnesses as to the fact that they were present at the time when and the place where the incident occurred; and of this fact we are satisfied that there can be no reasonable doubt, although, as frequently happens when ignorant witnesses are testifying in the courts in these Islands, their evidence is conflicting as to the precise hour by the clock when it took place.<br\/><br\/>Some attempt is made to discredit the testimony of Yotiga, because it appears from the record that in answer to certain questions on his examination-in-chief, he stated that when the blow was struck he was some hundred <i>brazas<\/i> (200 yards) away.\u00a0 It developed,\u00a0 however, on examination by the trial judge, that this answer was given under the impression that the question asked was the distance from the mine to the house of the sister of the deceased, as to which considerable testimony was taken; and it is very clear\u00a0 from all the testimony that both these witnesses were standing within a few yards of the defendant when he struck the blow.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of Dagapdap is also criticised because, in answer to\u00a0 the opening questions on the examination-in-chief, he spoke of the blow inflicted as a <i>bofetada<\/i> (a slap with the open hand on the cheek), which, later on in his testimony, he changed to the word <i>pu\u00f1etazo<\/i> (a blow with the fist), as a result, it is intimated, of suggestive questions by counsel for the prosecution.\u00a0 We do not think this criticism well founded, or that the language of the witness on which it rests sustains the inference sought to be drawn therefrom.\u00a0 In the first place, it must not be forgotten that the witness was manifestly an ignorant man, unskilled in the use of words, and testifying in a remote province in a native dialect; and that his testimony was interpreted into the Spanish of the record by an interpreter who might well have been mistaken in selecting the precise Spanish equivalent of the word or words actually used by the witness, and whose use of Spanish throughout the record does not demonstrate such precision and nicety in the use of words as to justify the laying of too much stress on the phrasing adopted by him in the haste of interpretation in the course of a trial in open court: so that, in our opinion, the detailed description of the manner in which the blow was inflicted, as given by the witness without suggestion or assistance of any kind, is much more decisive as to its nature than the word by which reference to it was made.\u00a0 And in the second place, as appears from the <i>Diccionario Enciclopedico de la Lengua Castellana<\/i> and the <i>Diccionario de la Lengua por la Academia Espa\u00f1ola<\/i>, the word \"<i>bofetada,<\/i>\" when used strictly, connotes not merely a blow with the open hand, but such a blow struck on the cheek or side of the face, a meaning which the whole testimony of the witness clearly discloses it was not his intention to give to whatever word he did actually make use of in referring to the act.\u00a0 The definition of the word <i>\"bofetada,\"<\/i> as given in the former dictionary, is \"a blow which is given on the cheek (<i>mejilla<\/i>) with the open hand,\" and in the latter is \"a blow given with the open hand, on the side of the face (<i>carrillo<\/i>) or cheek (<i>mejilla<\/i>) of another.\"<br\/><br\/>It has also been suggested that the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution is inherently improbable, because, as it is said, if the blow had been struck as described by them, the injured person would necessarily have \"doubled up or over and not, as appears from their testimony, thrown up his hands and staggered away.\u00a0 No expert testimony was introduced at the trial upon this point, and while it may, perhaps, be admitted that if the blow took effect in the abdominal region, common experience would justify us in expecting as a result of the blow, that the injured person would \"double up or over,\" it must not be forgotten that the blow having been delivered over the ribs on the left side, it may as well have taken effect in the region of the heart; in the absence of expert testimony, we do not think that in that event, evidence that the injured person threw up his hands and staggered away is necessarily in conflict with the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution as to the weight of the blow and the place where it was inflicted.<br\/><br\/>We are satisfied that the evidence of record leaves no room for reasonable doubt that the defendant struck Saldivar a powerful body blow with his closed fist; and that whatever authority the defendant may have had to eject the deceased from the mining property and to use physical force to that end in case of need, the blow thus struck was far in excess of such authority, and was, therefore, unlawful, and can not be excused or justified as an exercise of necessary force in the exercise of a right.\u00a0 The defendant's own testimony does not indicate that there was any danger to be apprehended from Saldivar, and there is nothing in the record which would indicate that the defendant had reasonable ground to believe that he would offer a violent or even a substantial resistance to an attempt to expel him from the mining property.<br\/><br\/>We are satisfied also\u00a0 that the deceased came to his death as a result of the blow inflicted by the defendant.\u00a0 Two or three days prior to his death he was employed as a laborer in defendant's mine; his sister testified that on the morning of the day he died, he left her house in apparent good health and went to the mines to look for work; a short time afterwards he received a violent blow on his lower left side, a region of the body where many of the vital organs are located; and immediately thereafter, he started up the short trail leading to his sister's house, and died as he reached the door.\u00a0 In the absence of evidence of any intervening cause, we think there can be no reasonable doubt that his death resulted from the blow.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for appellant suggest that death may have been the result of some cause unknown, such as a fall, an assault by robbers, or perchance a suicidal frenzy, intervening between the time when the accused was last seen starting up the 200-yard trail to his sister's house, and the time when, as she testified, he died just as he reached her door, on his way back from the mine; and that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.\u00a0 But the doubt which must be decided in favor of an accused person in a criminal trial is a reasonable doubt, and not a mere whimsical and fanciful doubt, based upon imagined but wholly improbable possibilities, unsupported by evidence; and while we do not hold that it is absolutely and morally impossible that some other cause could have intervened to bring about the death of Saldivar, we do\u00a0 hold that there can be no reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonable man that death was in fact brought about by the blow inflicted by the accused, and was not the result of some independent cause intervening during the very short period of time prior to his death, during which he was not under observation by witnesses called at the trial.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the appellant enlarge on the fact that accepting defendant's statement that he sent the deceased away from the mines about a quarter past six, it would appear from the testimony of the sister of the deceased that about two hours may have elapsed between that time and the time when he arrived at her house.\u00a0 The sister fixed the time of the arrival of her brother at from 7 to 8 o'clock or possibly a little later; but she appears to have been an ignorant woman who did not know how to read the face of a clock, and it is quite clear that hers was no more than a rough estimate, based on the height of the sun, and the most that can fairly be inferred from the testimony is that the deceased was\u00a0 struck early on the morning in question, and that not long afterwards on the same morning, he died at the door of his sister's house 200 yards away.\u00a0 But even if it be granted that two hours actually did elapse from the time the deceased left the mines, until he reached his sister's house, this interval is not long enough to materially weaken the inference that the death resulted from the blow.<br\/><br\/>It is true that no autopsy was had on the body of the deceased, and that a medical officer called in by the accused who saw the body, but who does not appear to have examined it very closely, certified that he found no outward lesions or marks of violence; but this evidence is not sufficient to negative the existence of internal lesions, for the medical authorities inform us that death may and often does result from a blow over or near the heart or in the abdominal region, notwithstanding the fact that the blow leaves no outward mark of violence; and there is evidence in the record of the discovery on the cadaver of two suspicious black spots, one about the place where the blow was struck, and another at or near the umbilicus, though the evidence fails to disclose the precise nature of these discolorations.\u00a0 (Medical Jurisprudence, Taylor, 12th Am. Ed., pp. 310 and 388; Moulin's Treatise on Surgery, Hamilton, part 2, chap. 1, p. 151; <i>Tratado de Medicina Legal por Legran de Sulle<\/i>, Vol. II, pp. 206, 207.)<br\/><br\/>It has been suggested that the deceased may have had a weak heart or some other diseased organ, and that but for such physical defect death might not have ensued from the mere force of the blow inflicted by the defendant.\u00a0 There is no evidence to this effect, and on the contrary there is testimony in the record that on the morning before he died he was in apparent good health; and the fact that a few days before, he was able to work in the mines, and that he came to the mines that day in search of work, renders it highly improbable that he was suffering at that time from any grave organic weakness.\u00a0 But however this may have been, it has been frequently and justly decided that where death results as a direct consequence of the use of illegal violence, the mere fact that the diseased or weakened condition of the injured person contributed to his death, does not relieve the illegal aggressor of criminal responsibility.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Luciano, 2 Phil Rep,, 96; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Montes, 6 Phil. Rep., 443; see also decisions of supreme court of Spain, March 10, 1871, and June 26, 1880.)<br\/><br\/>Counsel for appellant also contend that even if it be granted that in unlawfully exercising force upon the person of the deceased, the appellant caused or contributed to his death, nevertheless he should at most be convicted of <i>homicidio por imprudencia temeraria<\/i> (homicide as a result of reckless negligence), because, manifestly, the unlawful act was not committed with intent to kill, and because, as counsel contend, the striking of the blow by the appellant was not an act adapted, or likely (<i>idoneo<\/i>) to inflict a death wound under ordinary circumstances, or reasonably calculated so to do.\u00a0 In support of this contention counsel cite decisions of the supreme court of Spain of November 9, 1885, February 10, 1876, July 5, 1888, and July 12, 1890, and appears to rely especially on the former decision wherein sentence of <i>homicidio por imprudencia temeraria<\/i> was imposed, the court holding <i>\"que es condicion esencial del delito de homicidio, que el hecho material de que resulte sea impulsado por voluntad libre encaminada por acto idoneo a causar la muerte o algun mal fisico que por consecuencia natural la produzca.\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>In that case, however, it was proven, and the court found that not only did the defendant not intend to kill the deceased but also that he did not intend to do him any physical injury whatever; but\u00a0 in the case at bar the evidence conclusively establishes the voluntary, intentional, and unlawful infliction by the accused of a severe blow on the person of the deceased; and while it is true that the accused does not appear to have intended to take the life of his victim, there can be no doubt that in thus striking the deceased, he intended to do him some injury, at least to the extent of inflicting some degree of physical pain upon him, and he is, therefore, criminally responsible for the natural, even if unexpected results of his act, under the provisions of article 1 of the Penal Code, which prescribes that-<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Any person voluntarily committing a crime or misdemeanor shall incur criminal liability, even though the wrongful act committed be different from that which he had intended to commit.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>In such cases the law in these Islands does not excuse one from liability for the natural consequences of his illegal acts merely because he did not intend to produce such consequences, but it does take that fact into consideration as an extenuating circumstance, as did the trial judge in this case.<br\/><br\/>What has been said sufficiently disposes of all errors assigned by counsel for appellant, except certain alleged errors of procedure in the court below which we do not think it necessary to discuss, because even if it be admitted that such errors were committed, they do not appear to have in any wise prejudiced the substantial rights of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial court should be and are hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres<\/i>, and <i>Mapa, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/>MORELAND, J., with whom concurs JOHNSON, J., dissenting:<br\/><br\/>The facts in this case, as claimed by the Government, are as follows:<br\/><br\/>The defendant, James L. Brobst, and another American, named Mann, were engaged in working a mine belonging to them, located in the municipality of Masbate, where they gave employment to a number of native laborers.\u00a0 Mann discharged one of these laborers, named Simeon Saldivar, ejected him forcibly from the premises and warned him not to come back, and told the defendant not to employ him again or permit him to be upon the premises because he was a thief and a disturbing element with the other laborers.\u00a0 A few days afterwards, at about 6 o'clock in the morning on or about the 10th of July, 1907, Saldivar, in company with three or four others, went to the mine ostensibly to look for work.\u00a0 The defendant, who at that time was dressing himself inside his tent, which was erected on the mining property, catching sight of Saldivar, ordered him off the place.\u00a0 Saldivar made no move to leave, and, although the order was repeated, still did not leave, although he said and did nothing whatever; whereupon, as claimed by the Government, the defendant became enraged, took three steps towards Saldivar and struck him a powerful blow with his fist on the left side, just over the lower ribs.\u00a0 Saldivar turned around, without saying a word, and went in the direction of his sister's house, which stood about 200 yards away and about 100 feet up the side of a hill.\u00a0 He was not seen by anybody after starting toward the house.\u00a0 About two hours later, slightly more or Jess, he came to the front door of the house in a dying condition.\u00a0 He died just after being carried into the house and was buried two or three days later.<br\/><br\/>The trial court found the defendant guilty of the crime of homicide, marked with the extenuating circumstances defined in subsections 3 and 7 of article 9 of the Penal Code in that the defendant had no intention of committing so grave an injury as that which he inflicted and that he struck the blow under such powerful excitement as would naturally produce entire loss of reason and self-control.\u00a0 Sentence of six years and one day of <i>prision mayor<\/i> was imposed, and from this sentence the defendant appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>The claim of the defendant is that he was not enraged, that he did\u00a0 not strike Saldivar, the decedent, a blow with his fist or a blow in any other manner, but that he simply stepped up to the decedent, put his open hand against him and pushed him gently backwards.<br\/><br\/>To secure a conviction it was necessary for the Government to prove, first, that the defendant unlawfully injured the decedent, and, second, that the decedent died because of that injury.<br\/><br\/>In this case the death is admitted.\u00a0 The cause of death is in dispute.\u00a0 The Government seeks to prove the cause of death by circumstantial evidence.\u00a0 The prosecution asserts that it has proved by direct evidence a blow or push delivered by the defendant to the person of the decedent, and, the subsequent death being admitted, asks the court to make the deduction that the one resulted from the other.\u00a0 No autopsy was had.\u00a0 No examination of the body, either before or after death, which merits the slightest consideration, was made by the prosecution.\u00a0 No expert testimony worthy of the name was produced by the Government as to the cause of death.\u00a0 Such as was given is not only wholly valueless, but positively ridiculous.<br\/><br\/>The prosecution claims to have proved by reliable evidence, <i>and rests its case wholly upon that proposition<\/i>, that the defendant administered to the decedent a powerful blow with the closed fist in the lower left side; that the death of decedent occurred very soon thereafter, and that, therefore, the irresistible inference is that the injury caused the death.\u00a0 The claim of a proper conviction rests upon the proposition laid down generally by the authorities that where there has been inflicted an injury <i>sufficient to produce death<\/i>, followed by the demise of the injured person, the presumption arises that the injury was the cause of death, and, if no\u00a0 other cause is suggested by the evidence, the conclusion becomes practically irresistible and need not be corroborated by expert testimony.\u00a0 It should be noted here, however, in order to avoid confusion, that if there is no injury <i>sufficient to produce death<\/i>, then that presumption does not arise and no conclusion as to the cause of death can be indulged without additional proof.<br\/><br\/>The first question to be decided in this case is, Was the blow one which, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, was <i>sufficient to produce death<\/i>?\u00a0 If it was, and that fact is established by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, then the conviction of the defendant might possibly be sustained-a proposition not necessary to decide under my view of the case.\u00a0 If it was not, then, there being an absolute failure of proof as to the cause of death, the judgment of conviction must be reversed.<br\/><br\/>The resolution of this question depends, in this particular case, wholly upon the nature and character of the blow delivered.<br\/><br\/>After a very careful and thorough examination of the proof adduced\u00a0 at the trial, I can not bring myself to believe that the prosecution has established satisfactorily that the blow complained of was sufficient to produce death.<br\/><br\/>I am not convinced that the claim of the Government that the alleged blow was delivered with the clenched hand, or fist, has been sustained.\u00a0 Three witnesses were sworn on behalf of the Government to the question of the blow alleged to have been delivered by the defendant to the decedent.\u00a0 One of them, Pedro Leocampo, testified flatly and directly that the push or blow (he does not designate by express words which it was) was administered with the open hand.\u00a0 At page 19 and following pages of the evidence he declares that, at the beginning of the incident in question between the defendant and the decedent, he had his back toward the participants, eating his breakfast; that he heard the defendant say to the decedent, \"<i>Fuera<\/i>, go ahead, <i>vamus<\/i>,\" and\u00a0 immediately turning his head he saw the defendant with his open hand extending toward and touching the body of the decedent; that he saw decedent then turn and walk away.\u00a0 Later, in replying to questions put by the trial judge, he said he was not quite sure whether the open hand of defendant actually touched decedent's body or not.\u00a0 It is unquestionable, however, that the movement of the defendant's hand which he saw was the blow or push which it is claimed caused the fatal injury; because it is admitted by all, and the evidence also on that point is undisputed, that what the witness saw was at least the critical part of the incident-the delivery of the alleged blow.\u00a0 Moreover, it is conceded that the alleged blow was not delivered until after the defendant had uttered the words referred to and had stepped forward at least one pace; and it is nowhere asserted or claimed by anybody that the defendant extended his hand toward the decedent more than once or that more than one blow was given.\u00a0 It is evident, therefore, that what the witness saw was the delivery of the very blow or push which the prosecution claims was the cause of death.\u00a0 If can not well be imagined, in view of the testimony given by this witness, how the Government could fairly claim otherwise.\u00a0 These conclusions are, I am convinced, fully supported by the testimony as it is found in the record.\u00a0 In answer to a question put by the fiscal on direct examination he\u00a0 said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"T.\u00a0 Que estuve de espalda con ellos y el americano no ha dicho nada y momentos despues dijo:\u00a0 'fuera, '<i>go ahead<\/i>,' le vi que tenia la mano abierta y esta mano toco el cuerpo de Simeon, pero no he visto como estaba.\" <\/blockquote> After cross-examination the court questioned the witness as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"J.\u00a0 \u00bfOyo Vd. ruido de algun golpe cuando el acusado Brobst dijo 'fuera de aqui?'-T.\u00a0 No he oido el golpe.<br\/><br\/>\"J.\u00a0 En el momento de decir 'fuera de aqui,' \u00bfa que distancia estaba Simeon del acusado?-T.\u00a0 A distancia de mas de una vara.<br\/><br\/>\"J.\u00a0 De modo que en aquel momento \u00bfestaba el occiso Simeon al alcance del acusado Brobst?-T.\u00a0 Si, se\u00f1or,<br\/><br\/>\"J.\u00a0 \u00bfY vio Vd. al acusado empujar al occiso Simeon?-T.\u00a0 No puedo decir si el acusado empujo a Simeon.<br\/><br\/>\"J.\u00a0 \u00bfVio Vd. a Simeon Saldivar retroceder en el momento de decir el acusado 'fuera de aqui?'-T.\u00a0 He visto retroceder y dar las espaldas.<br\/><br\/>\"J.\u00a0 <i>Cuando hizo el ademan de empujarle, \u00bfcomo tenia el pu\u00f1o-cerrado o abierto<\/i>?-T.\u00a0 <i>Tenia la mano abierta<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"J. <i> \u00bfEn que forma?<\/i>-T.\u00a0 <i>Tenia abierta la mano<\/i>.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The testimony of this witness clearly\u00a0 discloses the fact that he saw the critical part of the event, that is, the part wherein the hand of the defendant touched the body of the decedent in the alleged blow.\u00a0 <i>At that moment the hand of the defendant was open. <\/i><br\/><br\/>The witness Miguel Yotiga, another witness called by the Government, testified on pages 2, 3, and 4 of the record that during the month of July, 1907, he was at the place where the dispute in question occurred.\u00a0 Then follow these questions and answers, among others:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"F.\u00a0 \u00bfSabe Vd. si durante el mes de Julio de 1907 que estuvo Vd. trabajando alli ha occurrido alguna cosa extraordinaria?-T.\u00a0 Si, se\u00f1or.<br\/><br\/>\"F.\u00a0 \u00bfQue es?-T.\u00a0 El haber <i>abofeteado<\/i> el americano a <i>un tao<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"F.\u00a0 \u00bfEstaba Vd. presente?-T.\u00a0 Si, se\u00f1or.<br\/><br\/>\"F.\u00a0 Relate Vd. fielmente en este juzgado todo lo que Vd. ha presenciado desde el principio hasta el fin.-T.\u00a0 Yo he sido asalariado por el para acarrear arroz.\u00a0 Cuando llegue en las minas era ya de noche, y al requerir nuestro salario nos dijo Cristobal que nos dormiriamos alli porque el americano estaba ya durmiendo y que Vds. pueden salir muy temprano por la ma\u00f1ana.\u00a0 Se nos dio el salario por el acarreo del arroz, y despues de darnos el salario se nos dijo que quedaramos para desayunar.\u00a0 Despues de desayunar llegaron tambien 4 hombres; el cocinero me dijo:\u00a0 'Miguel, presente Vd. a estos 4 hombres por si el Sr. Brobst los quiere emplear en el trabajo.'\u00a0 Los 4 individuos fueron uno tras otro.\u00a0 Yo dije al Sr. Brobst si aun pueden trabajar esos 4 hombres.\u00a0 El Sr. Brobst se levanto para ver a aquellos 4 hombres, al ultimo de los cuales le pego una <i>bofetada<\/i>, y yo habia visto la <i>bofetada<\/i> que le dio en la cintura en elbolo colocado en la cintura, e inmediatamente el hombre se dirigio a la casa de su hermana.<br\/><br\/>\"F. \u00bf\u00c1 que distancia estaba Vd. de Mr. Brobst cuando dio el <i>pu\u00f1etazo<\/i> a aquel individuo?-T.\u00a0 Una distancia de 10 metros.<br\/><br\/>\"F.\u00a0 \u00bfSabe Vd. por que el acusado habia dado <i>pu\u00f1etazo a aquel<\/i>?-T.\u00a0 Que yo le he visto pegar con 61 <i>bofeton<\/i>, pero que no se el motivo.<br\/><br\/>\"F.\u00a0 \u00bfCruzaron entre ellos alguna disputa 6 ri\u00f1a antes que el acusado haya dado el <i>golpe<\/i>?-T.\u00a0 No se nada, unicamente he visto que cuando llegaba Mr. Brobst dio el <i>pu\u00f1etazo<\/i>.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>Later on the witness says, in reply to leading questions, that the blow was struck with the closed hand and was a heavy one.<br\/><br\/>It will be observed from this testimony that the witness, in making his statement in narrative form and without the influence which particular words in questions frequently exerts on simple-minded witnesses, used the\u00a0 words <i>abofeteado<\/i> and <i>bofetada<\/i> in speaking of the kind of blow which the defendant administered to the decedent.\u00a0 The word <i>bofetada<\/i>, as well as <i>abofeteado<\/i>, means a blow with the open hand.\u00a0 It does not mean a severe blow, and particularly not a blow with the fist or closed hand.\u00a0 It is much nearer in character to a push than it is to a <i>pu\u00f1etazo<\/i>, which is always a blow with the fist.\u00a0 It is a light slap rather than a blow.\u00a0 It is the diminutive of the word <i>bofeton<\/i>; that is to say, if it can be called a blow at\u00a0 all, it is a gentler blow than would be signified if the word bofetdn were use.\u00a0 All of the dictionaries say that pu\u00f1etazo is a blow with the clenched hand, or fist, and that bofetada is a blow with the <i>open<\/i> hand.\u00a0 The dictionaries also say, in giving the definition of <i>bofeton<\/i>, that it is the <i>aumentativo de bofetada<\/i>.\u00a0 In his testimony on pages\u00a0 2, 3, and 4, the witness continually and persistently used the word <i>bofetada<\/i> in describing the blow given by the defendant to the decedent until the word <i>pu\u00f1etazo<\/i> was suggested to him or put into his mouth, as it were, by the questions of the fiscal.\u00a0\u00a0 Then the witness himself picked up the word and thereafter used it.\u00a0 No amount or species of word torture can make the word \"slap\" mean a blow with the fist.\u00a0 No more can <i>bofetada<\/i> be made to mean <i>pu\u00f1etazo<\/i>.\u00a0 A witness who, in describing the same blow, first uses the word <i>bofetada<\/i> and then, after suggestion, changes it to <i>pu\u00f1etazo<\/i>, provokes a contradiction in his testimony, which, if not explained, militates strongly against his credibility.\u00a0 This is especially so when the change in the word goes to the very essence of the cause of action, as it does in this case.\u00a0 This whole case depends upon whether the word <i>pu\u00f1etazo<\/i> or the word <i>bofetada<\/i> correctly describes the event out of which this action grows:<br\/><br\/>It is but repeating the general experience of those familiar with the trial of causes to say that suggestions to a witness by the form and specific wording of a question are of very frequent occurrence.\u00a0 The suggestion produces the same result whether wilfully made and received or innocently indulged, as was undoubtedly the case here on the part of the fiscal.\u00a0 In the case of an ignorant or simple-minded witness, his vocabulary being limited, he catches very readily, as a rule, the words used by the interrogator and, in his answers, uses the exact words in which the question is propounded, without, perhaps, being in the least conscious that the words he assumes do not exactly, sometimes not at all closely, represent what he really wants to express.\u00a0 These suggestions display one of the vices found by the courts in what are termed \"leading questions,\" and furnish a reason for the rule uniformly enforced in trial courts that they will not be permitted.<br\/><br\/>The questions and answers already quoted illustrate this vice forcibly as to the use by the witness Yotiga of the words <i>bofetada<\/i> and <i>pu\u00f1etazo<\/i>.\u00a0 On page 5 of the evidence occurs another illustration.\u00a0 There the fact sought to be elicited was whether the blow was gentle or severe.\u00a0 \"F.\u00a0 \u00bf<i>Hizo despacio o fuerte?<\/i>-T. Fuerte.\"\u00a0 On pages 12, 19, and 24 the following occurs:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"F.\u00a0 \u00bfDonde toco-directamente en el cuerpo o en el bolo?-T.\u00a0 Dio en el bolo.<br\/><br\/>\"F.\u00a0 \u00bfEn que parte del bolo-en la vaina o en el pu\u00f1o?-T.\u00a0 En el pu\u00f1o del bolo.<br\/><br\/>\"F.\u00a0 \u00bfEra fuerte el pu\u00f1etazo o flojo?-T.\u00a0 Fuerte.<br\/><br\/>\"F.\u00a0 Cuando el acusado\u00a0 pego a Simeon\u00a0 Saldivar, \u00bfestaba riendose o estaba furioso?-T.\u00a0 Furioso.<br\/><br\/>\"F.\u00a0 \u00bfTenia cerrado el puno o abierto la mano?-T.\u00a0 Cerrado la mano.\" <\/blockquote> In these illustrations, it will be observed, the witness is presented by the questions with only two words to make use of in answering-one word the very extreme in one direction and the other word the very extreme in the other.\u00a0 The ignorant\u00a0 or simple-minded witness whose vocabulary is extremely limited, who is unused to court proceedings, is strongly tempted, and in many instances is virtually forced, to accept one word or the other and thereby assume one extreme or the other in making his answers, although the word made use of may not within many degrees express his real meaning.\u00a0 All of these questions were leading and suggestive, and, judging from the testimony given anterior to those questions, especially by the witness Yotiga, led to very marked contradictions of, or, at least, changes in, the evidence as previously presented.<br\/><br\/>The third and last witness for the Government who testified as to the blow was Fermin Dagapdap.\u00a0 In describing the blow this witness from the first used the word <i>pu\u00f1etazo<\/i>.\u00a0 This witness, however, stated that he was at the time of the occurrence about 100 <i>brazas<\/i> (600 feet) from the participants.\u00a0 Later in his testimony he attempts to claim that he gave 100 <i>brazas<\/i> as the distance which the decedent was from his brother's house at the time of the occurrence.\u00a0 This, however, is\u00a0 very difficult to believe in view of the evidence which he gave, as shown on page 25, which follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"F.\u00a0 \u00bf\u00c1 que distancia estaba Vd. de los dos cuando dio el pu\u00f1etazo?-T.\u00a0 Unas 100 brazas.<br\/><br\/>\"F.\u00a0 \u00bfVd. estaba a 100 brazas de distancia?-T.\u00a0 Si, se\u00f1or.<br\/><br\/>\"F.\u00a0 Indique Vd. aqui la distancia aproximadamente de las 100 brazas que Vd. dice.-T.\u00a0 Aquella casa de techo de hierro.<br\/><br\/>\"F.\u00a0 \u00bfEsa es la distancia donde Vd. estaba cuando dio el pu\u00f1etazo a Simeon Saldivar?-T. Si, se\u00f1or.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>If, after all that questioning as to the distance he was away from the scene of the occurrence, and if, after all the effort which the fiscal evidently made to induce in him a proper comprehension of the nature of the question, the witness did not then understand, he displayed qualities, or the lack of them, which justly lead to the conclusion that his testimony ought not to be given any weight whatever, especially where it is in conflict with the testimony of any witness more reliable.\u00a0 Moreover, his manifest evasions on cross-examination materially weaken any claim which may be made in favor of his credibility.<br\/><br\/>These witnesses for the Government are in conflict in other particulars.\u00a0 Yotiga declared that the incident occurred at eight o'clock in the morning.\u00a0 Dagapdap swore that it occurred at four o'clock in the morning.\u00a0 Yotiga declared that it happened while the workmen were eating breakfast; Dagapdap averred that it took place after breakfast and while the men were working.<br\/><br\/>It seems to me, therefore, that the direct testimony adduced by the Government to prove that the defendant delivered against the body of decedent a blow with his fist, is conspicuously weak, particularly when we take into consideration that one of the Government witnesses flatly contradicts the other two in every important point; and that testimony, taken in connection with all the circumstances surrounding and accompanying the incident, seems rather to support the testimony and claim of the defendant that he did not strike the decedent with his fist but gave him a push with his open hand.<br\/><br\/>The following are the said circumstances, present at the very time the act complained of was committed, which go to prove that the blow, alleged to have been delivered against the body of the decedent, was not a blow at all in the real sense of the word and was wholly insufficient ordinarily speaking, to cause any injury whatever:<br\/><br\/>The decedent at the time showed absolutely no signs of having been injured in the slightest degree.<br\/><br\/>(a)\u00a0 The three witnesses for the prosecution above referred to, Yotiga, Dagapdap and Leocampo, if their testimony is to be believed, unite in declaring that they were looking the decedent full in the face when the alleged blow was struck and that they saw thereon nothing but a perfectly natural expression.\u00a0 There is not the slightest evidence to show that the countenance of the decedent betrayed even the faintest appearance of pain, distress or discomfort at the time the blow was delivered or at any time thereafter so long as he was observed.<br\/><br\/>(b)\u00a0 Nobody heard any blow struck.\u00a0 It is conceded by every witness for the Government that there was no sound of a blow.\u00a0 There were at the place where the incident occurred about twenty men, all of them as close to the participants as were the three witnesses for the Government and yet, so far as can be gathered, not a person heard the sound of a blow.\u00a0 In fact, only three of the twenty (the witnesses for the Government) knew that anything unusual had happened at all.<br\/><br\/>(c)\u00a0 The decedent gave no cry of pain, made no exclamation, uttered no sound.\u00a0 This is the uncontradicted proof.<br\/><br\/>(d)\u00a0 The decedent did not reel or stagger backward, forward or sideways, nor did he lose his equilibrium in any way.<br\/><br\/>This is established by uncontradicted proof.\u00a0 Every witness for the Government declares that after the delivery of the alleged blow the decedent remained in a perfectly upright attitude and in a natural position; and that immediately after receiving the blow he turned and walked away.<br\/><br\/>One of the witnesses, after being sharply questioned by the fiscal, stated that on the delivery of the blow the decedent stepped back, threw up his arms and walked away.\u00a0 The following is his testimony:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"El Sr. Brobst * * * le pego una bofetada y yo habia visto la bofetada que le dio en la cintura en el bolo colocado en la cintura <i>e inmediatamente el hombre se dirigio a la casa de su hermana.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"F.\u00a0 \u00bfEn que posicion se quedo aquel individuo en el mismo momento de recibir el golpe?-T.\u00a0 Que <i>inmediatamente de haber recibido el pu\u00f1etazo se marcho<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"F.\u00a0 Yo le pregunto a Vd. en el mismo momento de haber dado el pu\u00f1etazo.-T.\u00a0 Que despus de dar el golpe se retrocedio y levanto los brazos y en seguida se marcho.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>It will be observed, from the evidence quoted, that the witness testified at. first that the decedent did nothing on receiving the blow except to turn and walk away.\u00a0 This testimony the witness repeats in response to a second question of the fiscal.\u00a0 The third question as to the same point was evidently very sharply put by the fiscal, and that effort drew from the witness the additional statement, quite inconsistent with his two previous ones, that the decedent stepped back and<i> threw up his arms<\/i>.\u00a0 Neither of the other two witnesses for the Government saw this latter manifestation on the part of the decedent.\u00a0 One of them, Leocampo, testifies directly that no such thing happened, and the other, Dagapdap, although one of those who claimed to have been an eyewitness of the whole affair and who assumed to describe the whole incident in detail, fails to mention the very important fact, if it is a fact, that the decedent <i>threw up his arms<\/i>.\u00a0 He testified that the decedent simply whirled around and walked away.<br\/><br\/>The claim of the prosecution\u00a0 that the decedent staggered at the time of the alleged blow is based upon the translation of \"<i>dio vueltas<\/i>.\"\u00a0 One of the. Government's witnesses says that on the delivery of the blow the decedent <i>\"dio vueltas y se marcho.\"<\/i>\u00a0 So far as my researches go, no such interpretation can be given those words.\u00a0 They do not mean that he \"staggered.\"\u00a0 They mean simply that he turned or whirled around.\u00a0 This might follow a blow or a push.\u00a0 No other witness uses these same\u00a0 words; but the other two witnesses for the Government, in describing the same act of the decedent, used words which, it may fairly be assumed, in order\u00a0 to maintain as much harmony as possible in the testimony of the Government's witnesses, were intended to mean the same thing.\u00a0 Such words are <i>\"se dirigio a la casa,\"<\/i> and <i>\"volvi la cara y\u00a0 se marcho el difunto.\"<\/i>\u00a0 These words were used by the other two Government witnesses in describing the very same act to which the other Government witness applied the description <i>\"dio vueltas.\"<\/i>\u00a0 Those words can not possibly be construed to mean that the decedent staggered.<br\/><br\/>(e)\u00a0 The decedent, according to the testimony of the prosecution, did not attempt to ward off, dodge or escape the blow in any way.<br\/><br\/>He had abundant opportunity to do so.\u00a0 It is nowhere denied, but always admitted, that the defendant twice ordered the decedent to leave the place and after delivering the order the second time advanced toward him a pace or two.\u00a0 The decedent was fully warned.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet the witnesses of the prosecution claim that, up to the time the blow touched him, he made no move whatever.\u00a0 It is unbelievable that the decedent would permit\u00a0 the defendant to walk up to him, after due warning, and plant a powerful blow in his abdomen without any effort to dodge or escape and without the slightest effort to ward off the blow by movement of body, hand, or arm.\u00a0 The throwing of the arms down to protect the abdomen in such a case is involuntary and almost inevitable; and the fact that he did not do so points strongly to the conclusion that he was not struck as claimed.<br\/><br\/>(f)\u00a0 The body of decedent exhibited no external sign of injury after death.<br\/><br\/>Two witnesses were sworn by the prosecution,as to signs of injury upon the body of the decedent.\u00a0 One, the father of decedent, laborer, testified that at 4 o'clock of the afternoon of the day after the alleged injury (the alleged injury occurred at about 6\u00a0 a. m.) he examined the body of decedent and found a black spot about the size of a peso on the left side.\u00a0 The other witness, Alejandro Santiago, 70 years, farmer and herbalist, declared that he examined the body, he does not remember when, and found a black spot on the ribs (he does not remember on which side of the body) and another one on the navel.\u00a0 The cause of these spots, if they really existed, is pure speculation.\u00a0 Certainly one blow could not make both.\u00a0 They may have been caused by the decedent falling or by\u00a0 handling the body at the time of or subsequent to death, or by ecchymosis.\u00a0 No one know.\u00a0 Certain it is that an examination of the body by a licensed physician, Hans Hoch, made the day of the alleged injury, some hours thereafter, disclosed, so the physician testified, absolutely no external sign or evidence of injury.\u00a0 While the absence of external signs of injury is not conclusive that there was no injury, still such signs are usual in cases of this character and their absence is significant and important.<br\/><br\/>The weight of the testimony produced seems, therefore, to be that there were no external signs of injury upon the body of decedent-certainly none that were fairly traceable to the blow, even if delivered in the manner and with the force claimed by the Government.<br\/><br\/>It seems to me, therefore, that there is an essential and fatal conflict in the evidence of the prosecution.\u00a0 The prosecution claims (and portions of the direct testimony of some of its witnesses tend to prove) that the defendant gave the decedent a powerful blow with his fist, full in the left side; on the other hand, other portions of that testimony are utterly and destructively contradictory to that claim.\u00a0 It is contrary to the universal experience of life to assert that a man, receiving in his lower left side a powerful blow with the fist, a blow which, it is claimed, was sufficiently forcible to cause death within a short time, can maintain an erect and natural posture and exhibit absolutely no signs of pain.\u00a0 Experience also demonstrates that it is little short of the impossible that one receiving such a blow would <i>throw his arms up<\/i>.\u00a0 I do not believe a case can be cited where that has occurred.\u00a0 It is the experience of mankind that under\u00a0 such circumstances the person always throws his arms <i>down<\/i>.\u00a0 Such a blow in or about the abdomen or in the lower ribs produces such a shock to the nervous system, causes such a contraction of all the muscles thereabouts, induces such a difficulty of respiration, and such great pain, that the person so struck is not only wholly unable to throw his arms up but he is absolutely incapable of maintaining the body in an erect position.\u00a0 He involuntarily and inevitably throws the arms down over the abdomen and bends the body forward at the hips.\u00a0 In other words, using a phrase which almost universal experience has taught accurately describes the position necessarily assumed by one receiving such a blow, he would \"double up like a jackknife.\"\u00a0 The claim that the blow was a powerful one delivered with the fist is so utterly inconsistent with the appearance and conduct of the decedent at the time of the assault and subsequent thereto as to lead almost necessarily to the conclusion that no such blow was struck.\u00a0 Granting such a blow, it would be little short of the impossible, it certainly would be most extraordinary, for the decedent to exhibit no signs of pain, maintain an erect and natural position, preserve perfectly his equilibrium with the exception of stepping backward a little, turn in the ordinary way and walk off the premises at his usual and natural gait and with his usual and natural carriage.\u00a0 The entire absence of symptoms or evidence of injury <i>at the time of the act<\/i> complained of is, in my judgment, of the very gravest importance.\u00a0 It speaks louder and stronger and clearer than all the other evidence in the case as to whether or not the decedent was actually injured <i>at that time<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, the theory and claim of the defendant, that he simply stepped forward and pushed the decedent backward lightly with the open hand, after ordering him to leave, explains fully and satisfactorily every fact and every circumstance above mentioned as being so utterly inconsistent with the claim of the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>(1) It explains why the decedent did not try to dodge or escape or protect himself by movement of the body, or by using the hands and arms to defend himself from the assault of this enraged and furious man.\u00a0 There was no violence from which he needed to protect himself.<br\/><br\/>(2) It explains why there was no cry of pain, no appearance of distress, no reeling, staggering, falling, doubling up or other exhibition or sign of injury.\u00a0 It explains why he did not at once drop to the ground, as he naturally and almost inevitably would on receiving a blow such as is sought to be established by the prosecution.\u00a0 There was no violence or force to cause any of these things.<br\/><br\/>(3) It explains why decedent was able to walk away promptly at his usual gait and with his customary carriage.<br\/><br\/>(4) It explains why there was no satisfactory proof of marks of violence or external signs of injury\u00a0 on the body of the decedent.<br\/><br\/>(5) It explains why nobody of all who were present heard the sound of a blow, not even the witnesses for the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>(6) It explains why, among the twenty persons there present, only a very small per cent knew that anything unusual had taken place.<br\/><br\/>(7) It explains why the witness Yotiga first used the word <i>\"bofetada\"<\/i> instead of <i>\"pu\u00f1etazo\"<\/i> or <i>\"golpe.\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>(8) It explains why the witness Leocampo testified that the defendant's hand was open at the very time of its contact with decedent's person.<br\/><br\/>(9) It explains the entire lack of reason or motive on the part of defendant inducing him to inflict on the decedent punishment as severe as would follow such a blow.<br\/><br\/>It seems, therefore, to be demonstrated from the evidence that the prosecution has not only not sufficiently substantiated its claim that the blow was delivered with the fist, but has failed as well to show that any blow, in the real sense of that term, was struck.\u00a0 Rather the strong tendency of the proof, taken as a whole, together with all the circumstances, is to support the contention of the defendant that he simply pushed the decedent back with the open hand.\u00a0 That being so, it is perfectly apparent that such an act was utterly insufficient to produce death.<br\/><br\/>As stated at the outset, the Government rests its case wholly upon the proposition laid down by the authorities that where there has been inflicted an injury sufficient to produce death, followed by the demise of the injured person, the presumption arises that the injury was the cause of death, and, if no other cause is suggested by the evidence, the conclusion becomes practically irresistible and need not be corroborated by expert testimony.\u00a0 But it must always be remembered that the basis of and the reason for that presumption is the injury <i>sufficient to produce death<\/i>.\u00a0 If the\u00a0 injury is not one capable of producing death, ordinarily speaking, then no such presumption can possibly arise.\u00a0 The law invariably requires that there be established by clearest proof the connection between the injury and the death, making the one the result of the other.\u00a0 Where the injury is one capable of producing death that connection of cause and effect is established\u00a0 between the injury and death by the <i>inherent nature of the act<\/i>-its sufficiency to produce death.\u00a0 But where the act is one not sufficient to produce death, then the relation of cause and effect is not established for the reason that the act fails of the very quality from which the presumption of cause and effect springs, namely, its capability of producing death.\u00a0 In such a case, when the Government has proved simply the injury and death, it has done nothing.\u00a0 The connection between the two is wholly lacking.\u00a0 It is indispensable to a conviction in such case that the Government prove the <i>cause<\/i> of death; and that cause must be proved in addition to the fact of injury.\u00a0 This the Government has wholly failed to do.\u00a0 No effort was made to do so.\u00a0 The Government rested its case entirely upon the presumption, which it assumed arose by reason of the injury and death, to establish the relation of cause and effect between them.\u00a0 No autopsy was held.\u00a0 No one knows the cause of death.\u00a0 The incident occurred at about 6 o'clock a. m.\u00a0 The decedent died at about 8 o'clock the same morning.\u00a0\u00a0 He left the scene of the event instantly.\u00a0 He was not seen again by anybody, so far as the evidence shows, until the very moment of his death.\u00a0 Where he was, what he did, and what happened to him during the two hours intervening, the evidence does not disclose.<br\/><br\/>It being fairly established by the evidence that the defendant simply pushed the decedent, the remaining question is simple.\u00a0 The\u00a0 land and premises where the event transpired belonged to the defendant.\u00a0 The decedent, according to the evidence, was known to the defendant as a thief and as a maker of mischief among the workers in the mines.\u00a0 Only two days before the event from which this suit arose defendant had seen the decedent forcibly ejected from these same premises by one Mann, a partner of defendant; and the defendant was at that time advised by Mann that the decedent was a mischief-maker and a thief and should not be allowed about the mines.\u00a0 The defendant had a right to protect his property from invasion, particularly by such a person as he believed decedent to be; and if, being upon the premsies, decedent refused to leave when given fair warning, the defendant had a right to eject him there-from using no more force than was necessary to that end.\u00a0 (Cooley, Torts, 1st Ed., 167; McCarty <i>vs.<\/i> Fremont, 23 Cal., 196; Woodman <i>vs.<\/i> Howell, 45 111., 367; Bucher

evidence as shown by the preceding discussion.<br\/><br\/>Wills, on Circumstantial Evidence, says on\u00a0 page 291:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"(3) In the proof of criminal homicide the true cause of death\u00a0 must be clearly established;\u00a0 and the possibility of accounting for the event by self-inflicted violence, accident or natural cause, excluded; and only when it has been proven that no other hypothesis will explain all the conditions of the case can it be safely and justly concluded that it has been caused by intentional injury.\u00a0 But, in accordance with the principles which govern the proof of every other element of the <i>corpus delicti<\/i>, it is not necessary that the cause of death should be verified by direct and positive evidence; it is sufficient if it be proven by circumstantial evidence, which produces a moral conviction in the minds of the jury, equivalent to that which is the result of positive and direct evidence.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>In the People <i>vs.<\/i> Bennett (49 N. Y. 144) the court said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"In determining a question of fact from circumstantial evidence, there are two general rules to be observed:\u00a0 (1) The hypothesis of delinquency or guilt should flow naturally from the facts proved, and be consistent with them all, (2) The evidence must be such as to exclude, to a moral certainty, every hypothesis but that of his guilt of the offense imputed to him; or, in other words, the facts proved must all be consistent with and point to his guilt not only, but they must be inconsistent with his innocence.\"<br\/><br\/>\"On an indictment for murder, the prosecutor must prove that the blows caused the death; but, if he proves that the blows were given by a <i>dangerous weapon<\/i>-were followed by <i>insensibility<\/i> or <i>other alarming symptoms<\/i>, and soon afterwards by death; this is sufficient to impose it on the accused, to show that the death was occasioned by some other cause.\"\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Wiltberger, Fed. Cas. No. 16738.) <br\/><br\/>\"On trial for murder, the State's failure to prove by what means the deceased came to his death is fatal to its case.\"\u00a0 (Cole <i>vs.<\/i> The State, 59 Ark., 50.)<br\/><\/blockquote><blockquote>\"In order that a defendant may be properly convicted by circumstantial evidence, all the circumstances proved must be consistent with each other, consistent with the hypothesis that the accused is guilty, and, at the same time, inconsistent with the hypothesis that he is innocent, and with every other rational hypothesis except that of guilt.\" (12 Cyc, 488; U.

but on the 3d of September, 1907, the trial judge\u00a0 set this judgment aside on the ground that the defendant municipality's failure to answer within the time prescribed by law was the result of the excusable negligence of its counsel.\u00a0 To this order plaintiff duly excepted, and now assigns as error the action of the court in this regard.<br\/><br\/>Section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure is as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Upon such terms as may be just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a judgment, order, or other proceeding taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect:\u00a0 <i>Provided<\/i>, That application therefor be made within a reasonable time, but in no case exceeding six months after such judgment, order, or proceeding was taken.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>This section clearly places the granting of relief from judgments and orders, upon such terms as may be just, within the discretion of the trial court, and there is nothing in the record which indicated an abuse of this discretion in the case at bar.\u00a0 The provincial fiscal, upon whom the law imposes the duty of representing the defendant municipality in this action, frankly admitted in his motion that he had negligently overlooked filing the answer on behalf of the municipality, and explained that his failure so to do was due to the many urgent demands, upon his time and attention in the performance of his duties as prosecuting attorney during the term of court then pending.\u00a0 The trial judge accepted this explanation as sufficient, and we can not say that under all the circumstances, which were peculiarly within his knowledge, he erred in doing so.<br\/><br\/>The only evidence in the record in support of plaintiff's allegation that the parcel of land in question is included within the boundary limits of plaintiff's tract is the testimony of plaintiff's attorney, who stated on the witness stand that he knew the location of the land in dispute and that it lies within the boundary lines of the tract of land described in plaintiff's composition title (<i>titulo de composition<\/i>), which was introduced in evidence.<br\/><br\/>We agree with the trial court that, in view of the other evidence in the record, the oral testimony of this witness is not sufficient to establish the allegation of the complaint that the land claimed by plaintiff lies within the boundary limits set out in his composition title.\u00a0 The witness evidently knew very little about the precise location either of the land of his client or of that alleged to have been unlawfully occupied by the\u00a0 defendant municipality.\u00a0 The original complaint filed by him alleged the unlawful occupation by defendant of a parcel of land containing not less than three hectares, while the amended complaint alleges that the land of the plaintiff occupied by the municipality contains not less than ten hectares.\u00a0 He knew nothing, apparently, of his own knowledge or observation, of the extent of the land which he said had been unlawfully occupied by the defendant, nor of the actual location of the boundary line of his client's land; and on the witness stand, he was unable, or in any event failed utterly, to say in what part of the larger tract the land in dispute is located.<br\/><br\/>The land claimed by the plaintiff is described in the amended complaint as a parcel of not less than 10 hectares \"included in the official inventory of the real estate of the defendant municipality,\" and it was proven in the court below that the land thus described is a part of the territory upon which is located the barrio of Arando, founded in the year 1852, and since that time settled and occupied by the people of the barrio who claim title to the land occupied\u00a0 by them\u00a0 through or from the defendant municipality.\u00a0 The witnesses for the defense testified that the lands of the plaintiff lie to the south of this barrio; that since the year 1852, down to the time when this action was instituted, neither plaintiff nor his predecessors in interest had ever asserted any claim of title in or to the lands now in dispute; and that plaintiff, since the date of his composition title, had bought from some of the inhabitants of the barrio several small tracts of land within the parcel of land in dispute.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff's composition title does not show that the tract granted therein included the parcel of land on which the barrio of Arando is located, and it would seem at least very probable that, if this land had in fact been included in plaintiff's title when it was issued, some reference to that fact would be made therein, the barrio having been founded and organized long before the composition title was issued.<br\/><br\/>The complaint alleges that until a few months prior to the filing of this action plaintiff did not know that defendant occupied the land in question.\u00a0 But the evidence conclusively establishes that the land whereon the barrio of Arando is located, which includes the land in dispute, has been occupied publicly, openly, and peaceably by, and has continued under the control of, defendant, its predecessors, and successors in interest for more than half a century.\u00a0 It would seem, therefore, that until a few months prior to the filing of this action plaintiff did not know or believe that the land in dispute was included within the boundaries of his tract as described in his composition title issued many years ago.\u00a0 Yet, beyond the bare assertion of his attorney that one tract is included in the other, there is not a scintilla of evidence in the\u00a0 record in support of his claim now put forward for the first time; nor has he attempted to explain why he now pretends that the land in question is included in his grant, although for so many years he was not aware of that alleged fact.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of record wholly fails to sustain plaintiff's allegation that the land in dispute, as described in the complaint, lies within the boundary lines of the tract described in his composition title, and judgment was therefore properly rendered in favor of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The trial Court, however, appears to have gone beyond the issues submitted in the pleadings, and after finding that the evidence of\u00a0 record does not affirmatively establish plaintiff's allegations declared that even if it be a fact that the land in question is included within the boundary limits of plaintiff's tract as set out in his composition title, then the composition title is to that extent void, its issue having been fraudulently procured by the plaintiff or his predecessors in interest.\u00a0 The court also undertook to adjudicate the status of the streets and plaza of the above-mentioned barrio.\u00a0 These matters were never properly in issue in this action, and indeed it may well be doubted whether the validity of the grant evidenced by plaintiff's duly recorded composition title could have been put in issue by a collateral attack in this action, so as to give the trial court jurisdiction to adjudicate these questions.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below should be modified by striking out as much thereof as goes beyond the adjudication of the case in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff on the ground that plaintiff failed to establish the material allegations of his complaint, and, thus modified, the judgment appealed from should be and is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

No. 4978, March 01, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, <i>VS.<\/i> MELECIO MABILING, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The accused was convicted of the crime of robbery with force and violence, as defined and penalized in paragraph 4 of article 503 of the Penal Code, and sentenced to twelve years and one day of <i>presidio mayor<\/i>, with the accessory penalties prescribed by law.<br\/><br\/>On the night of Sunday, the 29th day of June, 1908, two unknown persons entered the house of the complaining witness, Vicente Llorin, in the barrio of San Pedro, of the municipality of Pagbilao, in the Province of Tayabas.\u00a0 They were accompanied by a third person who remained at or near the door of the house, at the head of the steps which led up to the door.\u00a0 The only occupants of the house were Llorin and his wife.\u00a0 After having lighted a lamp, which they found in the house, the robbers awakened Llorin and his wife, one of them placing the point of his bolo against Llorin's breast; Llorin succeeded in wresting this bolo from the hands of his assailant, but he was overcome in the fight which ensued, and with his arms tied behind his back was thrown helpless upon the ground.\u00a0 In the course of the fight he received ten wounds on his hands, arms, and body.\u00a0 The robbers demanded money, and took by force from a belt around the woman's body the sum of one peso, which was all the money in the house, and immediately thereafter took their departure.<br\/><br\/>The third person who accompanied the two who entered the house took no active part in the commission of the crime, but stood awaiting his companions, at or near the door.\u00a0 Llorin and his wife both testified that they saw and recognized this person by the light of the lamp, and that he was the accused, Melecio Mabiling, a neighbor with whom they had been acquainted for many years.\u00a0 The husband stated that at the time of the robbery the accused wore the same clothes which he had on at the time of the trial; that he did not have on a hat; and that the only thing he said or did was to ask his companions if he, Vicente Llorin, had yet been tied, to\u00a0 which he received an affirmative answer.\u00a0 The husband also stated that the accused stood at the side of the door above the steps while his companions were within the house, and that he recognized him <i>por su traje, su cara y la forma de su cuerpo<\/i>.\u00a0 The wife testified, among other things, that the accused wore a hat, and that at the time of the robbery he was standing on the steps listening to what was going on, with his body half through the door, and that the only thing the accused said was to ask his companions why they did not throw the man on the ground \"with his mouth downwards.\"<br\/><br\/>The accused, Melecio Mabiling, is a laborer, whose house is not more than a quarter of a mile from the house in which the crime was committed.\u00a0 In the\u00a0 month of March, a few months prior to the robbery, he was seriously wounded in a fight, and\u00a0 was under medical attention until the 15th of April, at which time, according to the testimony of the doctor, his wounds had not yet healed.\u00a0 At the time of the commission of the crime he was able to walk, but with difficulty and with the aid of a cane.\u00a0 He testified that he spent the night during which the crime was committed in the house of a neighbor, Mateo Cabrera, where he had gone to borrow a rope, and that he had not returned to his own house on that night because of the inclemency of the weather, to which he did not dare expose himself as his wounds had not yet completely healed.\u00a0 Cabrera and his wife positively and definitely corroborated his testimony in this regard, the wife adding that having been awakened by her child about midnight, she saw the accused who was at that time asleep; and that the following morning he left the house with the rope which he had come to borrow the night before.<br\/><br\/>There can be no reasonable doubt that the crime of robbery was committed substantially as described by the complaining witnesses. The only question is as to the accuracy of their identification of the accused as the person who was standing at the door at the time of its commission.\u00a0 The house or cabin where the crime was committed consisted of but one room, so that the light of the lamp should have rendered it easy for the complaining witnesses to identify the accused if it be true that he exposed himself, while he was standing at the door at the time when the robbery was being committed, and yet the contradictions which we find in the very simple story which they related, and the clear and positive testimony of the witnesses to the alibi set up by the accused, are such that we do not think we can hold that the testimony of record established the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.<br\/><br\/>The husband and wife differed in their account of what was said by the accused; the husband testified that the accused did not wear a\u00a0 hat, and that he was standing above the stairs and beside the door, while the wife testified that the accused did wear a hat which she described, and that, while his companions were within the house, he was standing on the stairs with his body halfway through the door.\u00a0 It is not impossible or perhaps improbable that the witnesses were testifying truly as to their recollection of what occurred and what they saw, for it might well be that in the struggle within the house, their attention was not directed to\u00a0 the person standing at the door and to what lie said, at the same time; but we are inclined to think that these apparent contradictions are sufficient to raise some doubt as to whether both of the witnesses did in fact see the person standing at the door and identify him as the accused.\u00a0 Both testified that the person who was standing at the door took no direct part whatever in the commission of the crime, and no satisfactory reason is suggested, which could have induced the accused, who know that he was well known to his neighbor whose house was being robbed, to expose himself to identification with his hat off, as testified by the husband, or to push his body through the door in the full light of the lamp, as testified by the wife.\u00a0 That the accused at the time of the robbery was still suffering from the severe wound he had received some months before, was conclusively established, and there would appear to be a certain element of improbability in the contention of the prosecution that he accompanied the robbers on that occasion to the very door of the house; for, while he might have gone with them, either as a guide, or to aid and assist them by watching on the outside, on neither supposition would it appear advisable or necessary for him to mount the steps and expose himself to identification at the very door of his victims, especially in view of his physical condition, which forced him to walk with the aid of a cane.<br\/><br\/>The witnesses for the defense were definite and positive in their testimony as to the whereabouts of the accused on the night of the robbery, and their evidence is in nowise impeached save only by the contradiction of the complaining witnesses involved in their identification of the accused as one of those who took part in the robbery.\u00a0 In view of all the testimony, and taking into consideration the possibility of mistake on the part of the complaining witnesses, and the possibility of malice, which is suggested by the statement of the accused that he received the wounds from which he suffered in a fight with a relative of the woman who was robbed (a fact which was contradicted but not satisfactorily proven or disproven), we feel ourselves compelled to give the accused the benefit of the doubt and to find him not guilty of the crime with which he was charged.<br\/><br\/>The judgment and sentence of the trial court are reversed with the costs of both instances <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de oficio<\/span> and the accused will be set at liberty forthwith.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

VICENTA SALVILLA AND PASCUAL SIERRA, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">A bill of exceptions was submitted to this court for the reason that the judgment entered by the Court of First Instance of Albay was in favor of the defendants, holding that the plaintiff is not the owner of the land claimed in his complaint which was dismissed with costs.\u00a0 The appeal having been heard it now appears:<br\/><br\/>That the plaintiff states, as the third allegation of fact in his complaint, that he is the sole owner with full control of a parcel of land the situation, area, and boundaries of which are therein described; and, as the fourth allegation of fact, that the defendants were the <i>aparceros<\/i> of the plaintiff, that is to say, the persons who during the last six years worked a portion of the said land, delivering to the plaintiff one-third of the crops at the time of each collection, but that in the month of June, 1906, they unlawfully retained all the land described in the third paragraph of the complaint, and still retain it, depriving the plaintiff of the possession thereof, both defendants pretending to own the property, and claiming that they have a title of owner- ship and a right to the possession of the said land as against the plaintiff; for this reason he prayed, in conclusion:\u00a0 (<i>a<\/i>) that it be held that the said land belongs to the plaintiff and that he is entitled to the possession thereof; (<i>b<\/i>) that the defendants be compelled to restore the possession of the same to the plaintiff; (<i>c<\/i>) that the defendants be sentenced to pay to the plaintiff the sum of 1,000 pesos for loss and damages; (<i>d<\/i>) that the defendants be likewise sentenced to pay the costs of the proceedings.<br\/><br\/>In answer to the complaint the defendants alleged:\u00a0 (1) That the land to which the complaint refers is of the sole and exclusive ownership of the defendants, the same having belonged to them since the year 1895, by virtue of just title and good, faith; and (2) that the defendants from the time when the said land was acquired, and prior to said year their principals, have always been in quiet, peaceful, and uninterrupted possession of said land; the situation, area, and boundaries of the land in question are described as being those set forth in the complaint; there is no substantial difference between the parties as to the identity of the property.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff proved the third statement made in his complaint, by means of a possessory information recorded in the registry of property on the 4th of September, 1895.\u00a0 The following facts appear in the information:\u00a0 That the plaintiff, Macario Samson, quietly and peacefully possessed as owner among several other parcels of land, the parcel that appears as the eighth, which is a rice field in the sitio of Mabariu with the area and boundaries therein stated, and that the said property was acquired by purchase under an agreement of <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, without a fixed term, from Don Ramon Espinas on the 11th of August, 1892, for the sum of 500 pesos.\u00a0 The plaintiff requested to be permitted to offer witnesses; notice of his petition was given to the former owners of the land, who were named therein, among whom appeared Ramon Espinas as vendor under the <i>pacto de retro<\/i>; the signature of Ramon Espinas appears in the notice wherein it is stated that neither the adjoining owners, nor the former owners of the land described in the possessory information, had any objection to the claim of Macario Samson.\u00a0 This documentary evidence was admitted at the trial without opposition, the attorney for the defendants simply reserved his right to impugn its legal effects.\u00a0 (Stenographic notes, 7).<br\/><br\/>In connection with fact 4, as alleged, the plaintiff offered the testimony of witnesses to demonstrate that Ramon Espinas while living, as well as the defendants after his death, worked the land in question and paid him with a portion of the fruits that they collected therefrom; Pascual Sierra does not deny this fact, but admits that he agreed to give the plaintiff one-half of the products of the rice field in question (Stenographic notes, 22), expressly stating that-<br\/><blockquote>\"Since 1896 on account of what I owed him, I continued to deliver to him annually part of the products until the past year 1906, at which time Macario Samson desired to demonstrate that he owned the land; I then said no, as a creditor I will always deliver to him his share, but as an owner, no; for said reason he filed a complaint with this court.\"\u00a0 (Stenographic notes, 24.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The defendants in turn presented documentary evidence which consisted of a possessory information prepared in the same month as that of the plaintiff Samson, in the name of Ramon Espinas; this possessory information was recorded prior to that of the plaintiff, to wit, on the 24th of June, 1895, and in addition thereto a public instrument of sale executed, as stated therein, thirteen days after the death of Ramon Espinas, by his mother, Guillerma Aguilar, in favor of Vicenta Salvilla y Espinas, the wife of Pascual Sierra.\u00a0 The registrar refused to record the instrument because the properties sold were not registered in the name of the vendor, and because, in their description, they did not coincide with any of those that were registered in the name of the vendor's principal.\u00a0 Up to this point the question involved in the allegations of facts set forth would have the juridical effect of two possessory inscriptions recorded in the registry of property in connection with one and the same property.\u00a0 But in this suit there exist, in addition, the facts hereinafter set forth which are sufficient to define the juridical status of the property which is the subject of contention.<br\/><br\/>The real defense, as developed by the defendant, Sierra, in his testimony, consists of the following allegation:\u00a0 That when he purchased this land in 1895 he needed cash, and he called on Macario Samson together with another purchaser, asking for money; that Macario Samson told them that the late Ramon Espinas owed him money and that they ought to pay it to him, and that upon this condition he would let each of them have the 100 pesos which they desired.\u00a0 The other purchaser alluded to is Juan Hernandez, a witness for the defense, who testified in almost the same terms; and that it was in this manner that Juan Hernandez and Pascual Sierra took charge of the debt that Ramon Espinas held in favor of Macario Samson for the total sum of 700 pesos which they divided between them, each one binding himself to pay 350 pesos, plus the 100 loaned to each of them.\u00a0 (Folios 20 and 28.)<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the suit consists in that the plaintiff, Samson, claims the possession and ownership of the land in question as property of his own, which was sold to him under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> in 1893 by Ramon Espinas; the defendants on the other hand maintain that Ramon Espinas did not sell it to Samson with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, but that he simply owed the latter 700 pesos the payment of whichi Hernandez and Sierra assumed in equal parts, because they had purchased the land that Espinas left at his death which was inherited by his mother, Guillerma Aguilar; Pascual Sierra and his wife were the real owners of the land in question and as such owners they were in possession thereof.<br\/><br\/>Without taking into consideration the former proofs offered by both parties to the suit, that is to say, the possessory information above referred to, the evidence presented by the defendants under No. 4 is relevant; it consists of the receipt that, it is claimed, was issued by Juan Hernandez in favor of Macario Samson when recognizing the 350 pesos as a portion of the debt of Ramon Espinas plus the 100 pesos that he received on loan, with regard to which receipt Juan Hernandez testifies in the following terms:<br\/><blockquote>\"When Guillerma Aguilar sold us the property of the late Ramon, Macario Samson appeared and said that the late Ramon owed him money and we, Pascual Sierra and myself, assumed the liability in favor of Macario Samson, by means of an agreement which consisted in that, out of the products of my field, I was to deliver the one half to Macario Samson; the debt in favor of the latter was of 700 pesos, of which 350 corresponded to me and the other half, 350, corresponded to Sierra, and I issued a receipt for 450 which included the 100 pesos I had received; the plaintiff ceased to receive the products of the land since I redeemed it in 1900.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The receipt Exhibit No. 4 of the defendants reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"I hereby declare that I am indebted to Don Macario Samson in the sum of 450 pesos received in cash to my entire satisfaction, for which reason I sell to him under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> the land that I have acquired by purchase from Do\u00f1a Guillerma Aguilar, recorded this day by the public notary of this district under register No. 79, and as to the proper execution of this contract I hereby bind myself to perform the same at any time that the creditor may request me so to do.\u00a0 And, in the meantime, I give to this extrajudicial document full legal force and effect, and in consequence thereof I hereby bind myself to comply with everything that has been set forth above. Albay, May 29, 1895.-Juan Hernandez.\"<br\/><br\/>Upon presentation of this document by the defense, Pascual Sierra declared that he had executed another document of the same tenor in favor of the plaintiff, the only modification being the reference to the instrument of sale executed by Guillerma Aguilar in favor of Hernandez which bears No. 79, whereas that executed in favor of Sierra's wife is numbered 64.\u00a0 And Sierra proceeds to testify :<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Which was the land that you sold Macario Samson on <i>pacto de retro?<\/i>-A.\u00a0 The same land in question.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. In what year?-A.\u00a0 In 1895.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. On what paper was it executed?-A.\u00a0 On one like this [document No. 4], wherein I engaged to sell under <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, and binding myself to execute the bill of sale as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Has he received the products of the land since then?-A.\u00a0 No, sir; he commenced to receive them in 1896.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Do you mean to say that you sold the said land in the month of April, March, or June, or in what month?-A.\u00a0 In May or June.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>According to the above testimony the defendant Sierra sold the land to the plaintiff Samson in May or June, 1895, a document similar to the one executed by Juan Hernandez being executed to that effect, which document is numbered 4 of those exhibited by the defense; the defendant alleges that the contents of the document by him executed in favor of the plaintiff, and which according to him must be in the possession of the latter, is as follows, with the modification as indicated:<br\/><blockquote>\"I hereby declare that I am indebted to Don Macario Samson in the sum of 450 pesos, value received in cash from him to my entire satisfaction, for which reason the lands which I acquired by purchase from Do\u00f1a Guillerma Aguilar and which have now been recorded in the office of the notary for this district with the register number 64, remain or become sold to him with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, and I engage to execute a proper contract at any time when the creditor may demand it, and in the meantime I attach the fullest legal force and effect to this extrajudicial document, and in consequence thereof I bind myself to comply therewith.\u00a0 Albay (dated in May or June), 1895.-Pascual Sierra.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>According to section 322 of the Code of Civil Procedure, if a document is in the custody of the adverse party, he should be duly notified to produce it in evidence.\u00a0 If he then fails to do so the contents of the document may be proved as in the case of its loss.\u00a0 In the event of loss, section 321 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"*\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 its contents may be proven by a copy or by a recital of its contents in some authentic document, or by the recollection of a witness.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The supposed document in the custody of the plaintiff has not been offered in evidence by the latter, as appears on folio 7 of the record, and the defendant Sierra has made a recital of its contents as if he had literally reproduced it and presented document No. 4 which he states is of the same tenor, with a slight variation from the one which he asserts to be the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The defendant then submits his exception or defense to a judicial decision based on the contents of a document as set forth in No. 4 of the record, which is decisive as to the legal status of the property in question.<br\/><br\/>Said legal status is no other, according to the documentary and oral testimony offered by the defendant, than that of purchase and sale consummated with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, in the precise terms that are transcribed in the evidence.\u00a0 Among the documents in evidence is the following:<br\/><br\/><i>\"For which reason<\/i> (for the 450 pesos which he confessed to having received from the plaintiff) the lands that I have acquired by purchase from Da. Guillerma Aguilar * * *, <i>remain or become sold<\/i> under <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, and I engage to execute a proper contract at any time when the creditor may demand it, <i>and in the meantime<\/i> I attach the fullest legal force and effect to this extrajudicial document.\"<br\/><br\/>And the oral evidence is:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Which was the land that you sold Macario Samson on <i>pacto de retro?<\/i>-A.\u00a0 The same land in question.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. In what year?-A.\u00a0 In 1895.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. In what month?-A.\u00a0 In May or June.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From these precise terms there does not result a promise or engagement to sell under <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, but a sale made or consummated with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, with the engagement or promise, on the part of the vendor, to execute a formal contract whenever required to do so.<br\/><br\/>With nothing further than an identical document, or one prepared in the same terms, a contract of sale on <i>pacto de retro<\/i> was consummated on the part of Juan Hernandez similar to that at bar, and it produced all its effects without the necessity of executing a formal document or instrument of sale, the right reserved by means of the <i>pacto de retro<\/i> taking effect five years later, that is, in 1900, as declared by Hernandez himself when he said: \"and the plaintiff ceased to receive the products of the land since he redeemed the same in 1900.\"\u00a0 For the same reason the contract of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, which the defendant asserts was contained in a document identical to that of Hernandez, must be considered as consummated in May or June, 1895.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, it is necessary to decide the ownership of the property in question in the light of the terms of the alleged contract and of the acts done in connection therewith; and as the contract is one of sale, even though it be with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, really and positively conveying the ownership, possession of and other real rights in and to the land, it follows that the ownership of the property in question was conveyed to the plaintiff in May or June, 1895; and that what constitutes a promise, is the obligation to execute the contract in the form of a public instrument upon request of the creditor.\u00a0 Hence, the present ownership of the property rests with the plaintiff, and in accordance with article 348 of the Civil Code he is entitled to bring an action for the recovery thereof.<br\/><br\/>As to whether or not the vendor is still entitled to repurchase the property thus sold and thus transferred to the purchaser is immaterial in this case, because there has been no contention with respect to the prescription of the action for the enforcement of the right of redemption.<br\/><br\/>We can not therefore admit the opinion which defendant Sierra seems to have formed of the present status of the land in question when he states in his letter to the plaintiff:<br\/><br\/>\"I am well aware that the fields are mortgaged to you, and that you as the creditor, annually enjoy the share that appertains to you; but you must not mistake the mortgage for a title of ownership, because the latter does not rest with you nor with anybody else except my wife * * * my duty is to inform you when I collect the crop in order to give you the corresponding share as creditor, but never as an owner.\"\u00a0 (Exhibit B.)<br\/><br\/>If according to defendant Sierra, the contract by virtue of which there exists a juridical relation in connection with the land in question between him and the plaintiff, is set forth in a document identical to that drawn up between Samson and Hernandez, and if in the said document Sierra has stated, as he claims and firmly maintains, that in consideration of the sum of 450 pesos in cash which he received from Samson to his entire satisfaction, the said land has become sold under <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, and he engaged to execute at any time \"this contract in proper form,\" and gave to said extrajudicial document in the meantime the fullest legal force and effect, it is impossible to construe the agreement as one of loan with a mortgage made out in precise terms of sale on <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, when all reference to the said personal right of redemption is simply contained in the words:\u00a0 \"I declare that I am indebted to Don Macario Samson in the sum of 450 pesos,\" with which the document begins.<br\/><br\/>A public instrument reading:\u00a0 \"I hereby declare that I owe Don Macario Samson 450 pesos which I have received and for which a certain tract of land becomes sold under <i>pacto de retro<\/i>\" could be recorded in the registry of property as a title of ownership in favor of Samson, without prejudice to the personal right of repurchase agreed to in favor of Sierra.<br\/><br\/>The fact that the document invoked by the defendant as evidence of the contract entered into was not executed in a public instrument does not prevent the conclusion of law previously established; inasmuch as \"a private instrument, legally acknowledged shall have, with regard to those who signed it and their legal representatives, the same force as a public instrument.\" (Art. 1225, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Therefore, it must be concluded that the ownership of the land in question, on the strength of the contract of sale under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> above shown, rests with the plaintiff, and by virtue thereof he is entitled to bring the action for recovery as set forth in the complaint without right, however, to any indemnity by reason of damages, which lie also claimed, because neither the existence nor the amount of the damage was proven.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing we hold that the judgment appealed from should be and is hereby reversed; that it should be held and we do hereby hold that the ownership and possession of the land claimed appertain to the plaintiff.\u00a0 The defendants are sentenced to deliver the land and restore the possession of the same to the plaintiff.\u00a0 The defendants are absolved from the claim for loss and damages, without any special ruling as to the costs in both instances.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Willard<\/i>, and <i>Tracey, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",
