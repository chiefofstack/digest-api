We feel, however, that it is one which the court ought not to pass without notice although it is not expressly raised. If we\u00a0 permitted\u00a0 this cause to pass\u00a0 successfully\u00a0 through this court, thereby giving it our sanction, we might thereby mislead an innocent purchaser or an innocent incumbrancer of the property in question to part\u00a0 with\u00a0 his\u00a0 money upon the faith of such\u00a0 sanction only to find later, possibly, that there was a serious question as to whether or\u00a0 not the registered title upon\u00a0 which he\u00a0 had\u00a0 based\u00a0 his\u00a0 faith and paid his money was of doubtful validity.\u00a0\u00a0 We are of the opinion,\u00a0 therefore, that, upon this ground alone, it is the duty of this court to raise this question itself and present it for the consideration of the litigants in this case.\u00a0 There is another ground also.\u00a0 Where a cause of action is stated in the\u00a0 name of one\u00a0 person and the\u00a0 proofs show that the real\u00a0 party in interest\u00a0 is another person\u00a0 wholly\u00a0 distinct, the court should not permit\u00a0 the judgment to stand\u00a0 even though\u00a0 the question is not\u00a0 specifically raised.\u00a0 In\u00a0 such case there is no foundation upon which to base a judgment in favor of the plaintiff as there is\u00a0 a failure of proof of a cause of action in favor\u00a0 of the moving party.\u00a0 Justice will not\u00a0 permit\u00a0 us to overlook\u00a0 a case\u00a0 of that character and send it on to the future with the implied sanction which such action would give.<\/p><p>We are not unmindful of the force of the principle that courts, generally speaking, should not decide cases upon points not presented and argued, without giving the parties an opportunity to\u00a0 be heard upon such\u00a0 questions;\u00a0 and in reversing this judgment we do so with the knowledge that the\u00a0 defeated party may make application\u00a0 for reargument within the time prescribed by the rules of this court.<\/p><p>The judgment is hereby reversed and\u00a0 the application dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Mapa,\u00a0 Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em>\u00a0 concur.<\/p><\/div>",

DANIEL NAVARRO ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The appellants in\u00a0 this case were convicted in\u00a0 the court below of a violation of section 30 of the Election Law (Act No. 1582),, and each\u00a0 of them\u00a0 was sentenced to pay a\u00a0 fine of P200 and costs, to be extinguished at the rate of one day's imprisonment for each P2 of fine and costs\u00a0 remaining\u00a0 unpaid.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of record satisfactorily establishes that each of the appellants made oath, before an election officer in the municipality of Piddig, in proceedings had in connection with the general election held on the 2d day of November, 1909, that\u00a0 he owned real\u00a0 property to\u00a0 the\u00a0 value\u00a0 of P500.\u00a0 The evidence further discloses that at the time none of these appellants, except Daniel Navarro and Genaro Calixtro, owned property of the assessed value of P500.\u00a0 Upon this evidence we think the court below properly convicted all of the\u00a0 appellants except Daniel Navarro\u00a0 and Genaro Calixtro,\u00a0 but each\u00a0 of these defendants having proven that he owned, at the time when he made oath to the value of his property, real estate\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 assessed value of more than P500,\u00a0 the judgment of conviction as to them should\u00a0 be reversed.<br\/><br\/>It will be seen that the proof upon which the judgment of conviction rests is limited to evidence touching the <i>assessed<\/i> value of the property owned by the person making oath that he is a qualified voter.\u00a0\u00a0 It has\u00a0 been suggested that, under the statute, the true test of the qualification of a voter is the actual or market value of the real property owned by him and not the assessed value thereof, so that proof that one is not the owner of\u00a0 real property of the assessed\u00a0 value of P500 is not proof that he is lacking this qualification of a voter, in the absence of further proof that he is not the owner of unassessed real property of the value of P500, or that the assessed property owned by him is not of the actual or market value of P500 whatever may be the amount for which it is\u00a0 assessed.\u00a0 \u00a0<br\/>.<br\/>But while the statute\u00a0 does not in express terms declare that it\u00a0 is the ownership of property\u00a0 of the assessed value of P500 which determines this qualification of a voter, nevertheless,\u00a0 that such was the intention of the legislator becomes clear from an examination of the immediate context of the provision of the statute defining the \"property qualifications\" of voters, and of the statute as a whole, keeping in mind the purpose and object sought to be attained by the provisions of the statute generally, and particularly of those provisions defining qualifications and disqualifications of voters and providing machinery whereby persons entitled to vote may be secured in the exercise of that right, while any unlawful attempt to vote is severely penalized.<br\/><br\/>In the first place this qualification is made immediately alternative to the qualification based upon an annual payment of\u00a0 a fixed amount of the established\u00a0 taxes, both qualifications\u00a0 falling under\u00a0 a single head.\u00a0 This striking juxtaposition under one head or class of these separate and distinct kinds of qualifications at once suggests that in the mind of the\u00a0 legislator there was some intimate relation which justified their being thus bound together, as it were, under one head.\u00a0 The liability for the payment\u00a0 of\u00a0 a substantial amount of \"the established taxes\" at once sug- gests itself as the relation\u00a0 which must\u00a0 have been\u00a0 in the mind of the legislator, and\u00a0 since taxes are collected upon \"real property\" in accordance with its assessed Value, we think we are justified in concluding that it was the intention of the legislator to limit the grant of the voting\u00a0 franchise based upon ownership of\u00a0 real property to owners\u00a0 of real property to the\u00a0 assessed value of P500.<br\/><br\/>Our conclusion that this is the true meaning to be given the language of this section of the statute is reinforced by the fact that another section of\u00a0 the statute provides that \"any person\"\u00a0 is\u00a0 disqualified\u00a0 from\u00a0 voting \"who\u00a0 is delinquent in the payment\u00a0 of public taxes assessed since August thirteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight,\" this being the only disqualifying provision based on\u00a0 the nonpayment of taxes.\u00a0 It is quite clear that this provision was directed to the case of delinquency in the payment of land taxes as well as all other taxes, and it would indeed be an anomaly if the failure\u00a0 to pay <i>assessed <\/i>land taxes would <i>disqualify<\/i> one person, as a voter, while the possession of <i>nonassessed<\/i> real\u00a0 estate, whatever its value, could be held\u00a0 as the sole and sufficient ground upon which another person may <i>qualify<\/i> as a voter.<br\/><br\/>Finally, the most superficial examination of the statute as a whole discloses that many of its most important provisions looking to the due administration of the law as a whole - that is to say, as an election law - and especially those provisions intended to secure the purity of the ballot box, would be in large measure defeated, if not rendered wholly abortive by any other construction of the language of the provision under consideration than that which we give it.\u00a0 We confidently assert that, if a successful challenge of the right to vote,\u00a0 asserted by one basing his claim on his alleged\u00a0 ownership of property of the value of P500, could only be successfully\u00a0 maintained by proof that\u00a0 the real or market value of the land owned\u00a0 by\u00a0 him is\u00a0 less than P500,\u00a0 then the task assigned by the law to the electoral boards, the registration boards, the judges of elections, and other elective officers, as well\u00a0 as\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 courts of the\u00a0 Islands, could never be efficiently and intelligently performed so as to\u00a0 secure practical\u00a0 results within the limited time necessarily allowed to them\u00a0 for the.performance of their respective duties in connection with elections, in the event of\u00a0 any general or even considerable attack on the^purity of the ballot box by persons setting up an illegal claim of a right to vote based on this property qualification.\u00a0\u00a0 While\u00a0 on the other hand,\u00a0 such a construction placed\u00a0 on the language of the statute, would place, for\u00a0 practical\u00a0 purposes, almost\u00a0 arbitrary\u00a0 power in the hands of dishonest registration boards to harass honest voters seeking registration based on their property qualification, and to deny their right of registry on the pretense that the proof offered of the existence of such qualification is not satisfactory.<br\/><br\/>When the language of a particular\u00a0 section of a\u00a0 statute admits of\u00a0 more\u00a0 than one construction, that construction should be adopted which tends to give effect to the manifest purposes and objects sought to be attained by the enactment of the statute\u00a0 as a whole;\u00a0 and\u00a0 a construction should\u00a0 be rejected which would defeat or strongly tend to defeat the intention of the Legislature as\u00a0 expressed in\u00a0 other sections of the same statute.\u00a0\u00a0 Applying this rule in construing the provision of the Election Law under consideration, we have no doubt that it\u00a0 is the ownership of real property\u00a0 to\u00a0 the assessed value of F500, whatever may be the real or market value thereof, wjiich constitutes the qualification of voters prescribed in subsection (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">b<\/span>) section 13 of the Election Law.<br\/><br\/>The judgment\u00a0 of the court\u00a0 below, convicting and sentencing the appellants in this\u00a0 case, is affirmed as to all and each of them, except Daniel Navarro and Genaro Calixtro, with\u00a0 a proportionate share\u00a0 of the\u00a0 costs of this instance against the appellants as to whom the judgment is affirmed, the provision for the extinguishment of\u00a0 the penalty and costs\u00a0 being modified, however, so as to exclude\u00a0 therefrom the amount of the costs and so as to fix the\u00a0 rate of extinguishment at one day's imprisonment for each P2.50 of the fine imposed.<br\/><br\/>The judgment convicting and sentencing Daniel Navarro and Genaro\u00a0 Calixtro is reversed and those\u00a0 appellants are acquitted of the offense with which they are charged, with the costs of both instances <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de oficio<\/span> as to

McCullough,\u00a0 Thomas L. Hartigan, Frank E. Green, and Frederick H. Hilbert.\u00a0\u00a0 Mead has died since the commencement of the\u00a0 action and the case is\u00a0 now\u00a0 going forward in the name of his administrator as plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The complaint\u00a0 contains\u00a0 three causes of action, which are substantially as follows: The first, for salary; the\u00a0 second, for profits;\u00a0 and\u00a0 the third, for the value of the personal\u00a0 effects alleged to have been left by Mead and sold by the defendants.<br\/><br\/>A joint and several judgment was rendered by default against\u00a0 each\u00a0 and all\u00a0 of the\u00a0 defendants for the sum of $3,450.61 gold.\u00a0 The defendant McCullough alone having made application to have this judgment set aside, the court granted\u00a0 his motion, vacating the judgment as to him only, the judgment as to\u00a0 the\u00a0 other three defendants remaining undisturbed.<br\/><br\/>At the new trial, which took place some two or three years later and after\u00a0 the death\u00a0 of Mead,\u00a0 judgment was rendered upon the merits, dismissing the case as to\u00a0 the first and second causes of action and for the sum of $1,200 gold in the plaintiff's\u00a0 favor on the third cause of action. From this judgment both parties\u00a0 appealed\u00a0 and have presented separate\u00a0 bills of exceptions.\u00a0 No appeal was taken by the defendant McCullough from the ruling of the court denying a recovery on his cross complaint.<br\/><br\/>On March 15, 1902,\u00a0 the plaintiff (Mead will be referred to as the\u00a0 plaintiff in\u00a0 this opinion unless\u00a0 it\u00a0 is otherwise stated)\u00a0\u00a0 and\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 organized\u00a0 the \"Philippine Engineering and Construction Company,\" the incorporators being the only stockholders and also the directors of said company, with general ordinary powers.\u00a0\u00a0 Each of the stockholders paid into the company $2,000 Mexican currency in cash, with the exception\u00a0 of Mead,\u00a0 who turned over to\u00a0 the company personal property in lieu\u00a0 of cash.<br\/><br\/>Shortly after the organization, the directors held a meeting and elected the plaintiff as general manager.\u00a0 The plaintiff held\u00a0 this position with the company for\u00a0 nine months, when he\u00a0 resigned to accept the position\u00a0 of engineer of the Canton and Shanghai Railway Company.\u00a0\u00a0 Under this organization the company began business about April 1, 1902.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 contracts and work\u00a0 undertaken\u00a0 by the company during the management\u00a0 of Mead were the wrecking contract with the Navy\u00a0 Department at Cavite for the raising of the Spanish ships sunk by Admiral Dewey; the contract for the construction of\u00a0 certain\u00a0 warehouses for the quarter-master department; the construction of a wharf at\u00a0 Fort McKinley for the Government; the supervision of the construction of the Pacific Oriental Trading Company's warehouse; and some other odd jobs not specifically set out in the record.<br\/><br\/>Shortly after the plaintiff left the Philippine Islands for China, the other directors, the defendants in this case, held a meeting on December 24, 1903, for the purpose of discussing the condition\u00a0 of the\u00a0 company at that\u00a0 time and determining\u00a0 what course to\u00a0 pursue.\u00a0 They did on\u00a0 that date enter\u00a0 into the following\u00a0 contract with the defendant McCullough, to wit:<br\/><blockquote>\"For value received, this contract and all the rights and interests of the Philippine Engineering and Construction Company\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 same are\u00a0 hereby assigned to\u00a0 E.\u00a0 C. McCullough of Manila, P. I.<br\/><blockquote>(Sgd.)\u00a0 \"E. C.

GREEN, <i>Treasurer.<\/i><br\/>(Sgd.)\u00a0 \"THOMAS\u00a0 L.\u00a0 HARTIGAN, <i>Secretary.\"<\/i><br\/><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>The contract referred to in the foregoing document was known as the wrecking contract with the naval authorities.<br\/><br\/>On the 28th of that same month, McCullough\u00a0 executed and signed the following instrument:<br\/><blockquote>\"For value\u00a0 received,\u00a0 and\u00a0 having the above assignment from my associates in the Philippine Engineering and Construction Company, I hereby transfer my right,\u00a0 title, and interest in the\u00a0 within contract, with the exception of one-sixth, which. I hereby retain,\u00a0 to\u00a0 R.\u00a0 W. Brown,\u00a0 H. D. C. Jones, John\u00a0 T. Macleod, and T. H. Twentyman.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The assignees of the wrecking contract, including\u00a0 McCullough, formed what was known as the \"Manila Salvage Association.\"\u00a0 This association paid to McCullough $15,000 Mexican currency cash for the\u00a0 assignment of said\u00a0 contract. In addition to\u00a0 this cash payment, McCullough retained a one-sixth interest in the new company or association.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff insists that he\u00a0 was to receive\u00a0 as\u00a0 general manager of the first company a salary which was not to be Jess than\u00a0 $3,500 gold (which amount\u00a0 he\u00a0 was receiving as city engineer at the time of the incorporation of the company), plus 20 per cent\u00a0 of the net profits which might be derived from the business; while McCullough contends that the\u00a0 plaintiff was\u00a0 to receive only his necessary expenses unless the company made a profit, when\u00a0 he\u00a0 would receive $3,500 per year and 20\u00a0 per cent of the profits.\u00a0\u00a0 The contract entered into between the board of directors and the' plaintiff as to the\u00a0 latter's salary\u00a0 was a verbal\u00a0 one.\u00a0 The plaintiff testified that this contract was unconditional and that his salary,\u00a0 which was fixed\u00a0 at $3,500 gold,\u00a0 was not dependent upon\u00a0 the success of the company, but\u00a0 that his share of the profits was to necessarily depend upon the net income.\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, McCullough, Green and Hilbert testify that the salary of the plaintiff was to be determined according to whether or not the company was successful in\u00a0 its operations; that if the company made gains, he was to receive\u00a0 $3,500 gold, and a percentage, but that if the company did not make any profits, he was to receive only his necessary\u00a0 living\u00a0 expenses.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 strongly urged that the\u00a0 plaintiff would not\u00a0 have accepted the management of the company upon such conditions, as he was\u00a0 receiving from\u00a0 the city of Manila\u00a0 a salary of $3,500 gold.\u00a0 This argument is not only answered by\u00a0 the positive and direct testimony\u00a0 of\u00a0 three\u00a0 of the defendants, but also by the circumstances under which this company was organized and its principal object, which was the raising of\u00a0 the Spanish ships.\u00a0 The\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 put no money into the organization, the defendants put but little: just sufficient to get the\u00a0 work of raising the\u00a0 wrecks under way.\u00a0 This venture was\u00a0 a risky\u00a0 one.\u00a0\u00a0 All the members\u00a0 of the company realized that they\u00a0 were undertaking\u00a0 a\u00a0 most difficult and expensive project.\u00a0 If\u00a0 they\u00a0 were successful, handsome\u00a0\u00a0 profits would\u00a0 be\u00a0 realized; while\u00a0 if they\u00a0 were unsuccessful, all the expenses for the hiring of machinery, launches,\u00a0 and labor would be a total\u00a0 loss.\u00a0 The plaintiff was in complete charge and control of this work and was to receive, according to the great preponderance of the evidence,\u00a0 in\u00a0 case the\u00a0 company made\u00a0 no profits,\u00a0 sufficient amount to cover his expenses,\u00a0 which\u00a0 included\u00a0 his room, board, transportation, etc.\u00a0 The defendants were to furnish money out of their\u00a0 own private funds to meet these\u00a0 expenses, as the original $8,000 Mexican currency was soon exhausted\u00a0 in\u00a0 the work thus undertaken.\u00a0 So the contract entered into between the directors and\u00a0 the plaintiff as\u00a0 to the Jatter's salary was a contingent one.<br\/><br\/>It is admitted that the plaintiff received $1,500 gold for his services, and whether he is entitled to receive an additional\u00a0 amount depends upon the result of the\u00a0 second cause of action.<br\/><br\/>The second\u00a0 cause of action is more difficult to determine. On this point\u00a0 counsel for the plaintiff has filed a very able and\u00a0 exhaustive\u00a0 brief, dealing principally with the facts.<br\/><br\/>It is urged\u00a0 that the net profits accruing to\u00a0 the company after the completion of all the contracts (except the salvage contract) made before the\u00a0 plaintiff resigned as manager and up\u00a0 to the\u00a0 time the salvage contract was transferred to McCullough and from\u00a0 him to the new company, amounted\u00a0 to\u00a0 $5,628.37 gold.\u00a0\u00a0 This conclusion is reached, according to the memorandum of counsel for the plaintiff which\u00a0 appears on\u00a0 pages\u00a0 38 and\u00a0 39 of the record,\u00a0 in the following manner:<br\/><br\/><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" width=\"75%\"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\">Profits from the\u00a0 construction of warehouses for the Government........<\/td> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"18%\"><div align=\"right\">$6,962.54<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\">Profits from the\u00a0 construction of the wall at Fort McKinley..................................<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"right\">500.00<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\">Profits from the inspection of the construction of the P.

According1 to Exhibit No. 1, the old company was indebted to McCuIIough in the sum of $14,918.75 Mexican currency, and according to Exhibit No. 2 the indebtedness amounted to $6,358.15 Mexican currency.\u00a0 The debits and credits in these two exhibits are exactly the\u00a0 same with the following1 exceptions: In Exhibit No. 1, McCuIIough credits himself with the $10,000 Mexican currency (the amount borrowed from the\u00a0 bank and deposited with the admiral as a guarantee\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 faithful performance\u00a0 of the salvage contract)\u00a0 ; while in Exhibit No. 2 he credits himself with this $10,000, and at the same time charges himself with this amount.\u00a0 In the same exhibit\u00a0 (No. 2)\u00a0 he credits himself with $16,439.40 Mexican currency, his losses in the new company,\u00a0 and charges himself with the $15,000 Mexican currency,\u00a0 received\u00a0 from\u00a0 said company.\u00a0 Eliminating\u00a0 entirely from these two exhibits the $10,000 Mexican currency, the $15,000 Mexican currency, and the $16,439.40 Mexican currency,\u00a0 the balance shown in McCuIlough's favor\u00a0 is\u00a0 exactly the same in both exhibits.\u00a0 This balance amounts to $4,918.75 Mexican currency.<br\/><br\/>According to McCullough's accounts in Exhibits 1 and 2, the profits derived\u00a0 from the construction of the Government warehouses amounted to $4,005.02 gold,\u00a0 while\u00a0 the plaintiff contends that these profits amounted to $6,962.54 gold.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff, during his management of the old company, made a contract with the Government for the construction of these warehouses and commenced work.\u00a0\u00a0 After he resigned and\u00a0 left for China, McCuIJough took charge of and completed the said warehouses.\u00a0 McCuIIough gives a complete, detailed statement of expenses\u00a0 for the completion of this work, showing the dates,\u00a0 to whom\u00a0 paid, and for what purpose.\u00a0 He\u00a0 also gives the\u00a0 various amounts he\u00a0 received\u00a0 from the\u00a0 Government with\u00a0 the dates\u00a0 of the receipt of the\u00a0 same.\u00a0 On the\u00a0 first examination, McCuIIough testified\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 total amount received from the Government for the construction of these warehouses was $11,123 gold.\u00a0\u00a0 The case\u00a0 was suspended for the\u00a0 purpose of examining the records of the Auditor and the quartermaster,\u00a0 to determine the\u00a0 exact\u00a0 amount paid for this work.\u00a0 As a result of this examination, the vouchers show an additional amount of about $5,000 gold, paid in checks.\u00a0 These checks show that\u00a0 the\u00a0 same\u00a0 were endorsed\u00a0 by the plaintiff\u00a0 and collected by him from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.\u00a0 This money was not handled by McCullough and\u00a0 as\u00a0 it was\u00a0 collected by\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff, it must be\u00a0 presumed,\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 absence of\u00a0 proof, that\u00a0 it was\u00a0 disbursed by him.\u00a0 McCullough did not\u00a0 charge himself\u00a0 with\u00a0 the $2,500 gold, alleged to have been profits from the construction of the wall\u00a0 at Fort McKinley, the inspection of the\u00a0 construction of the P. 0.

The company had made\u00a0 no profits while that work was going on under the management of the plaintiff, but its expenses greatly exceeded that of the original $8,000 Mexican currency.\u00a0 It was necessary to borrow money to\u00a0 continue that work.\u00a0 These amounts, having been\u00a0 borrowed, were outstanding\u00a0 debts when McCullough took charge for the purpose of completing the warehouses and winding up the business\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 old\u00a0 company.\u00a0\u00a0 These amounts do not represent payments\u00a0 or\u00a0 refunds\u00a0 of\u00a0 the original capital. McCullough did not credit himself with any amount for his services for supervising the completion of the warehouses, nor for liquidating or winding up the company's affairs. We think that the amount of $4,918.75 Mexican currency, balance in McCulIough's favor up to this point, represents a fair, equitable, and just settlement.<br\/><br\/>So far we have referred to the Philippine Engineering and Construction Company as the \"company,\" without any attempt to define its legal\u00a0 status.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff and\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 organized this company with a\u00a0 capital stock\u00a0 of\u00a0 $100,000 Mexican currency, each paying\u00a0 in on the organization $2,000\u00a0 Mexican\u00a0 currency. The remainder, $90,000, according to the articles of agreement, were to be offered to the\u00a0 public in shares of $100 Mexican currency, each.\u00a0\u00a0 The names of all the\u00a0 organizers appear\u00a0 in the\u00a0 articles of agreement, which\u00a0 articles\u00a0 were duly inscribed\u00a0 in\u00a0 the commercial register.\u00a0 The purposes for which this\u00a0 organization was effected were to engage in general engineering and construction work, operating under the name of the\u00a0 \"Philippine Engineering and Construction Company.\"\u00a0 During its\u00a0 active existence,\u00a0 it engaged in the business of attempting to raise the sunken Spanish fleet, constructing under\u00a0 contract warehouses and a wharf for the United States Government, supervising the construction\u00a0 of\u00a0 a warehouse\u00a0 for a private firm,\u00a0 and\u00a0 some assay work.\u00a0 It was, therefore, an industrial civil partnership,\u00a0 as distinguished from\u00a0 a commercial\u00a0 one; a\u00a0 civil partnership in the mercantile form, an anonymous partnership legally constituted in the\u00a0 city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>The articles of agreement appeared in a public document and were duly inscribed in the commercial register.\u00a0 To the extent of this inscription the corporation\u00a0 partook of the <i>form <\/i>of a mercantile one and as such must be governed by articles 151 to 174 of the Code of Commerce, in so far as these provisions are not in conflict with the Civil Code (art.\u00a0 1670, Civil\u00a0 Code) ; but the direct and principal law applicable is the Civil Code.\u00a0 Those provisions of the Code of Commerce are applicable subsidiarily.<br\/><br\/>This partnership or stock company (sociedad anonima) upon\u00a0 the execution of the public instrument in which its articles of agreement appear, and the contribution of funds and personal property, became a juridical person - an artificial being, invisible,\u00a0 intangible, and existing only\u00a0 in contemplation of law - with the power\u00a0 to hold, buy,\u00a0 and sell property, and\u00a0 to\u00a0 sue\u00a0 and\u00a0 be\u00a0 sued - a corporation - not a general co-partnership nor a limited co-partnership.\u00a0 (Arts. 37, 38, 1665, and 1666\u00a0 of the Civil Code; Compania Agricola de Ultramar vs. Reyes et\u00a0 al., 4 Phil.

The work of trying to raise the sunken Spanish fleet had been for several months abandoned.\u00a0 The corporation under the management of the plaintiff had entirely failed in this undertaking.\u00a0 It had\u00a0 broken its\u00a0 contract with the naval authorities and the $10,000 Mexican currency deposited had been confiscated. It had no money.\u00a0 It was considerably in debt.\u00a0\u00a0 It was a losing concern and a financial failure.\u00a0 To continue its operation meant more losses.\u00a0\u00a0 Success\u00a0 was impossible.\u00a0 The corporation was civilly dead and had passed into the limbo of utter insolvency.\u00a0 The\u00a0 majority of the stockholders or directors sold the assets of this corporation, thereby relieving themselves and the plaintiff of all responsibility.\u00a0 This\u00a0 was the\u00a0 only\u00a0 wise and sensible thing for them to do.\u00a0\u00a0 They acted in perfectly good faith and for the best interests of all the stockholders.\u00a0 \"It would be\u00a0 a harsh ruile that would permit one stockholder, or\u00a0 any minority of stockholders to hold a majority to their investment where a continuation of the business would be at a loss and where there was no prospect or hope that the enterprise would be profitable.\"<br\/><br\/>The above sets forth the condition of this insolvent corporation when the defendant McCullough\u00a0 proposed to the majority of stockholders to take over the assets and assume all responsibility for the payment of the debts\u00a0 and the completion of the warehouses which had been undertaken. The assets consisted of office furniture of a value of less than P400, the uncompleted contract for the construction of the Government warehouses, and the wrecking contract. The liabilities amounted to at\u00a0 least $19,645.74 Mexican currency.\u00a0\u00a0 $9,645.74 Mexican currency of this amount represented borrowed money, and $10,000 Mexican currency was the deposit with the naval authorities which had been confiscated and which was\u00a0 due the bank.\u00a0\u00a0 McCullough's profits on the warehouse contract amounted to almost enough to pay the amounts\u00a0 which the corporation\u00a0 had borrowed from its members.\u00a0\u00a0 The wrecking contract which had been broken was of no value to the corporation for\u00a0 the reason that the naval authorities absolutely refused to have anything further to do with the Philippine\u00a0 Engineering and Construction Company.\u00a0 They\u00a0 (the naval authorities) had declined to consider the petition\u00a0 of the corporation for an extension of time in\u00a0 which to raise\u00a0 the Spanish fleet, and had also refused to\u00a0 reconsider their action in confiscating the deposit.\u00a0 They did agree, however, that if the defendant McCullough would organize\u00a0 a\u00a0 new\u00a0 association, that they would give the new concern an extension of time and would reconsider\u00a0 the question of forfeiture of the amount deposited.\u00a0 Under these circumstances and\u00a0 conditions, McCullough organized the\u00a0 Manila\u00a0 Salvage Company, sold\u00a0 five-sixths\u00a0 of this wrecking\u00a0 contract to\u00a0 the new company for $15,000 Mexican currency and\u00a0 retained\u00a0 one-sixth as his share of the stock in the new concern.\u00a0 The Manila Salvage Company paid to the bank the $10,000 Mexican currency which had\u00a0 been borrowed to deposit with the naval authorities, and began operations.\u00a0 All of the $10,000 Mexican currency so deposited was refunded to the new company except P2,000.\u00a0 The new association failed and McCullough, by reason of this failure, lost over $16,000 Mexican currency. These facts show that McCullough acted\u00a0 in good faith in purchasing\u00a0 the old corporation's assets, and\u00a0 that he certainly paid for the same,\u00a0 a valuable consideration.<br\/><br\/>But counsel for the plaintiff say: \"The board of directors possessed only ordinary powers of administration\u00a0 (Article X\u00a0 of the articles of incorporation), which in no manner empowered it either to transfer or to authorize the transfer of\u00a0 the\u00a0 assets of the company to McCullough\u00a0 (art. 1773, Civil Code; decisions of the\u00a0 supreme\u00a0 court\u00a0 of\u00a0 Spain of April 2, 1862, and July 8, 1903).\"<br\/><br\/>Article X of the articles of incorporation above referred to\u00a0 provides that the\u00a0 board of\u00a0 directors\u00a0 shall elect the\u00a0 officers of the corporation and \"have\u00a0 under its\u00a0 charge\u00a0 the administration of the said corporation.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Article XI reads: \"In all\u00a0 the\u00a0 questions with reference to\u00a0 the administration of\u00a0 the\u00a0 affairs of the corporation, it shall be necessary to .secure the unanimous vote of the board of directors, and at least three\u00a0 of said board must be present in\u00a0 order to constitute\u00a0 a legal meeting.\"\u00a0 It will be noted that Article X placed the administration of the affairs of the corporation in the hands of the board of directors.\u00a0 If Article XI\u00a0 had been omitted, it is clear that under the rules which govern business of that character,\u00a0 and\u00a0 in\u00a0 view of the fact that before\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff left this country and abandoned\u00a0 his office as director, there were only five directors in the corporation, then three would have been sufficient to constitute a quorum and could perform all the duties and exercise all the powers conferred upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 board under this article. It would not have been necessary to obtain the consent of all\u00a0 three of such members which constituted the quorum in order that a resolution affecting the administration of the corporation should be binding,\u00a0 as two votes - a majority of\u00a0 the\u00a0 quorum - would have been sufficient for this purpose.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Buell.vs. Buckingham &amp; Co.,\u00a0 16 Iowa, 284; 2 Kent.

He would have been a creditor to the extent of his unpaid salary if\u00a0 the corporation had been a\u00a0 profitable instead of a losing concern.<br\/><br\/>But as we\u00a0 have said when the sale or transfer\u00a0 under consideration took place, there were three directors present, and\u00a0 all voted\u00a0 in\u00a0 favor\u00a0 of making this\u00a0 sale. It was not necessary for the president, McCullough, to vote.\u00a0\u00a0 There was a quorum without him: a quorum of the\u00a0 directors, and at the same time a majority of the stockholders.<br\/><br\/>A corporation is essentially a partnership, except in form. \"The directors are the trustees or managing\u00a0 partners, and the stockholders are the cestui que trust and have a joint interest in all the property and effects of the corporation.\" (Per Walworth, Ch., in\u00a0 Kobinson <i>vs<\/i>.

Thompson, 1 Seld., 320.)<br\/><br\/>The Philippine\u00a0 Engineering and Construction Company was\u00a0 an artificial person, owning its property and necessarily\u00a0 acting\u00a0 by its\u00a0 agents; and\u00a0 these\u00a0 agents\u00a0 were the directors.\u00a0\u00a0 McCullough was then an agent or a trustee, and the stockholders the principal.\u00a0 Or say (as the corporation was\u00a0 insolvent)\u00a0 that he\u00a0 was an\u00a0 agent or trustee and the creditors were\u00a0 the beneficiaries.\u00a0 This being the true relation, then the rules\u00a0 of law (art. 1713\u00a0 of the Civil Code) applicable to sales and purchases\u00a0 by\u00a0 agents and trustees would not apply to the purchase in question for the reason that there was a quorum without McCullough, and for the further reason that an officer or director of a corporation, being\u00a0 an agent of an artificial person and having a joint interest in the corporate property, is not such an agent as that treated of in article 1713 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>Again, McCullough did not represent the corporation in this transaction.\u00a0 It was represented by a quorum\u00a0 of the board\u00a0 of directors, who were at the same time a majority of the stockholders.\u00a0 Ordinarily,\u00a0 McCullough's duties\u00a0 as president were to preside at the meetings, rule on questions of order, vote in case of a tie,\u00a0 etc.\u00a0\u00a0 He\u00a0 could not have voted in this transaction because there was no tie.<br\/><br\/>The acts of Hilbert, Green,\u00a0 Hartigan, and McCullough in this transaction, in view of the relations which they bore to the corporation, are subject to the most severe scrutiny. They are obliged\u00a0 to\u00a0 establish\u00a0 that they acted with the utmost candor and fair dealing for the interest of\u00a0 the corporation, and without taint of selfish motives.<br\/><br\/>We have\u00a0 subjected their conduct to this test,\u00a0 and,\u00a0 under the evidence, we believe it has safely emerged from the ordeal.<br\/><blockquote>\"Transactions which only accomplish justice, which are done in good faith and operate legal injury to no one, lack the characteristics\u00a0 of fraud\u00a0 and\u00a0 are not\u00a0 to\u00a0 be\u00a0 upset because the relations of\u00a0 the parties give rise to suspicions which\u00a0 are fully cleared away.\"\u00a0 (Hancock <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Holbrook, supra.)<br\/><\/blockquote>We therefore conclude that\u00a0 the\u00a0 sale or transfer made by the quorum of the board of directors - a majority of the stockholders - is valid and binding upon the minority - the plaintiff.\u00a0 This conclusion is not in violation of the\u00a0 articles of incorporation of the\u00a0 Philippine Engineering\u00a0 and Construction\u00a0 Company.\u00a0\u00a0 Nor do we here announce a doctrine contrary to that announced by the supreme court of Spain in its decisions dated April 2,\u00a0 1862, and July 8, 1903.<br\/><br\/>As to the third cause of action,\u00a0 it is insisted: First, that the court erred\u00a0 in\u00a0 holding\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant McCullough responsible for the personal\u00a0 effects of the plaintiff; and second, that the court erred in finding that the effects left by the plaintiff were worth P2,400.<br\/><br\/>As we have said, the plaintiff was the manager of the Philippine Engineering\u00a0 and\u00a0 Construction\u00a0 Company from April 1, 1902, up to January 1, 1903.\u00a0 Sometime during the previous month of December he resigned to accept a\u00a0 position in China, but did not leave Manila until about January 20.\u00a0 He remained in Manila\u00a0 about twenty days after\u00a0 he severed his\u00a0 connection\u00a0 with\u00a0 the company.\u00a0\u00a0 He\u00a0 lived\u00a0 in rooms in the same building which was rented by the\u00a0 company and where\u00a0 the company\u00a0 had its offices.\u00a0\u00a0 When\u00a0 he started for China he left his personal effects in those rooms, having turned the same over to one Paulsen.\u00a0 Testifying on this point the plaintiff said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. To\u00a0 whom did you turn over these\u00a0 personal effects on leaving here? - A. To Mr. Paulsen.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Have you demanded payment of this sum [referring to the\u00a0 value of his personal effects] ? - A. On leaving for China I gave Mr. Haussermann power of attorney to represent\u00a0 me in this case and demand payment.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Please state whether or not you have an inventory of these effects. - A. I had an inventory which was in my possession but it was lost when the company took all\u00a0 of the books and carried them away from the office.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Can you give a list or a partial list of your effects? - A. I remember some of the items.\u00a0 There was a complete bedroom set, two marble tables, one glass bookcase, chairs, all of the household effects I used when I was\u00a0 living\u00a0 in the Botanical Garden as city engineer, one theodolite, which I bought after commencing work with the company.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. How much do you estimate\u00a0 to be the total reasonable value of these effects? - A. The total value would not be less than $1,200 gold.\"<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the plaintiff, on page 56 of their brief, say:<br\/><br\/>\"Mr.\u00a0 McCullough, in his\u00a0 testimony (pp.\u00a0 39\u00a0 and 40) admits full knowledge of and participation in the removal and sale of the effects and states that he took the proceeds and considered them\u00a0 part\u00a0 of the assets\u00a0 of\u00a0 the company. He further admits that Mr. Haussermann made a demand for the proceeds of Mr. Mead's personal effects (p. 44).\"<br\/><\/blockquote>McGuIlough's\u00a0 testimony,\u00a0 referred to by\u00a0 counsel, is\u00a0 as follows: \"Q.\u00a0 At the time Mr. Mead left for China, in the building where the office was and in the office, there were left some of the personal effects of Mr. Mead.\u00a0 What do you know about\u00a0 these effects,\u00a0 a list\u00a0 of\u00a0 which is\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 B? - A. Nothing appearing in\u00a0 this Exhibit B was\u00a0 ever delivered to the Philippine Engineering\u00a0 and Construction\u00a0 Company, according to my list.<br\/><blockquote>\"Q.\u00a0 Do you know what became of these effects? - A. No, sir.\u00a0 I have no idea.\u00a0 I never saw\u00a0 them.\u00a0 I never heard these effects talked about.\u00a0\u00a0 I only heard something said about\u00a0 certain\u00a0 effects\u00a0 which Mr. Mead had\u00a0 in\u00a0 his living room.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Do you know what became of the bed of Mr. Mead? - A. I know there were effects, such as a bed, washstand, chairs, table, and other things, which are used in a living room,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that\u00a0 they\u00a0 were\u00a0 in Mr.\u00a0 Mead's\u00a0 room.\u00a0 These effects were sent\u00a0 to the warehouse of the Pacific Oriental Trading Company, together with the office furniture.\u00a0 We had to vacate the building\u00a0 where the offices\u00a0 were\u00a0 and we had\u00a0 to take out\u00a0 everything therein.\u00a0 These things were deposited in the warehouse\u00a0 of the Pacific Oriental Trading Company and were finally\u00a0 sold\u00a0 by\u00a0 that company and the money turned over to\u00a0 me.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 How much? - A. P49.97.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What did you do with this money? - A. I took it and considered it\u00a0 part of\u00a0 the assets of the company.\u00a0\u00a0 All of the other effects of the office were sold at the same time and brought P347.16.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Did Mr. Mead leave anyone in charge\u00a0 of his\u00a0 effects when he left Manila? - A. I think he left Paulsen in charge, but Paulsen did not take these effects, so when we vacated the office we.had to move them.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Did Paulsen\u00a0 continue\u00a0 occupying the living\u00a0 room where these effects were and did he use these effects? - A. I\u00a0 do not know because I was not\u00a0 in the office for\u00a0 three months before we vacated.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Don't you\u00a0 know that it is a fact\u00a0 that Mr. Haussermann, as representative of Mr.\u00a0 Mead,\u00a0 demanded of you and\u00a0 the company the payment of\u00a0 the\u00a0 salary\u00a0 which was due Mr. Mead and the value\u00a0 of his personal effects? - A. Yes, sir.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>As to the value of these personal\u00a0 effects, Hartigan, testifying as witness for the defendant, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"I think the personal effects were sold for P50.\u00a0 His personal effects\u00a0 consisted of ordinary articles, such as a person\u00a0 would use who had to be going\u00a0 from one place to another all the time, as Mr. Mead.\u00a0\u00a0 I know that all\u00a0 those effects were sold for less than P100, if I\u00a0 am not mistaken.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The foregoing\u00a0 is the material testimony with reference to the\u00a0 defendant McCullough's responsibility and the\u00a0 value of the\u00a0 personal effects of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>McCullough was\u00a0 a member of the company and was responsible as such\u00a0 for the rents where the offices\u00a0 were located.\u00a0 The company had no further use for the building after the plaintiff resigned.\u00a0\u00a0 The vacating of the building was the proper thing to do.\u00a0\u00a0 The office\u00a0 furniture was removed and stored in a place where it cost nothing for rents. When\u00a0 Hilbert, member\u00a0 of the company, went to the\u00a0 office to remove the company's office furniture, he found no one in charge of \"the\u00a0 plaintiff's personal effects.\u00a0\u00a0 He took\u00a0 them and stored them in\u00a0 the same place and later\u00a0 sold them, together with the office furniture, and\u00a0 turned\u00a0 the entire amount over to defendant McCullough.<br\/><br\/>Paulsen, in whose\u00a0 charge Mead left his effects, apparently took no interest in caring for\u00a0 them.\u00a0 Was the company to leave Mead's personal effects in that building and take the chances of having to\u00a0 continue to pay rents, solely on account of the\u00a0 plaintiff's\u00a0 property\u00a0 remaining there? The\u00a0 company had reason to\u00a0 believe that\u00a0 it would\u00a0 have to continue paying these rents,\u00a0 as\u00a0 they\u00a0 had\u00a0 rented the building and authorized the\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 to occupy\u00a0 rooms therein.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff knew when he left for China that he would be away a long time.\u00a0\u00a0 He had accepted a position of importance, and which he knew would\u00a0 require his\u00a0 personal attention.\u00a0 He did not gather up his personal effects, but left them in the room\u00a0 in charge of Paulsen.\u00a0 Paulsen took no interest in caring\u00a0 for them,\u00a0 but\u00a0 apparently left these effects to take care of themselves.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff did not even\u00a0 carry with him an inventory\u00a0 of\u00a0 these\u00a0 effects, but attempted on the trial to give a\u00a0 list of them and\u00a0 did give a\u00a0 partial list of the things he left in his room; but it is not shown that all these things\u00a0 were there when Hilbert removed the office furniture and\u00a0 some of\u00a0 the plaintiff's effects.\u00a0 The fact that the\u00a0 plaintiff remained in Manila some twenty\u00a0 days after resigning and never cared for his own effects but left them in\u00a0 the possession of an irresponsible\u00a0 person,\u00a0 shows\u00a0 extreme negligence on his part.\u00a0 He exhibited a reckless\u00a0 indifference to\u00a0 the consequences\u00a0 of leaving his effects in the leased premises.\u00a0 The law imposed on every person the duty of using ordinary care against injury or damages.\u00a0 What\u00a0 constitutes ordinary care depends\u00a0 upon the circumstances of each particular case\u00a0 and the dangers reasonably to be apprehended.<br\/><br\/>McCullough did\u00a0 not\u00a0 have anything\u00a0 personally to do with these effects\u00a0 at any time.\u00a0\u00a0 He only accepted the money which Hilbert turned over to him.\u00a0 He, personally, did not contribute in any way whatsoever to the loss of the property, neither did he as a member of the\u00a0 corporation\u00a0 do so.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff gave an estimate of the value of the effects which he left in his rooms and placed this value at P2,400. He did not give a complete list of\u00a0 the effects so left, neither did he give the value\u00a0 of a\u00a0 single item separately.\u00a0 The plaintiff's testimony is\u00a0 so indefinite and uncertain that it is impossible to determine with any degree of certainty just what these personal effects\u00a0 consisted of and their values, especially when we take into consideration the significant fact that these effects were abandoned by Paulsen.\u00a0 On the other hand, we\u00a0 have before us the positive testimony of Hilbert as\u00a0 to the amount received for the\u00a0 plaintiff's personal effects, the testimony of Hartigan that the same were sold for less than P100,\u00a0 and the testimony of McCullough as to the amount turned\u00a0 over to him by Hilbert.<br\/><br\/>So we conclude that the great preponderance of evidence as to the value of these effects is in favor of the contention of the\u00a0 defendant.\u00a0 Their value must therefore be fixed at P49.97.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the judgment\u00a0 appealed from\u00a0 as to the first and second causes of action is hereby affirmed.\u00a0 Judgment appealed from as\u00a0 to the third cause of\u00a0 action is reduced to P49.97, without costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The only question presented here\u00a0 is a question\u00a0 of fact, relating to the sufficiency of the evidence.<br\/><br\/>After a careful consideration of the evidence,\u00a0 the lower court made the following finding of\u00a0 facts:<br\/><blockquote>\"Early in the evening of March 29, 1910, that is, about 8 o'clock, the herein accused, Pedro Iglesia being armed with a revolver, appeared at the\u00a0 house\u00a0 of Santos Pascual and pretending to be detectives required him to\u00a0 exhibit his personal cedula.\u00a0 Besides his wife, two other women, Inocencia Fernandez and Marcela Jose, lived in Santos Pascual's house.\u00a0 The accused asked these two\u00a0 women where their husbands were,\u00a0 and, when they answered that they were away, Pedro Iglesia caught\u00a0 Inocencia Fernandez around the waist but she resisted such seizure and in the confusion escaped\u00a0 and took refuge\u00a0 in a neighboring\u00a0 house.\u00a0 The accused who had demanded Santos Pascual's personal cedula, took possession\u00a0 of it and made him and his wife go with them, under the pretext of conducting them to the town; but on reaching a solitary spot, called Nagtuturican, Juan Valdez\u00a0 separated the\u00a0 husband from his wife and Pedro Iglesia, who then threatened\u00a0 her, Dorotea de la Cruz, with the revolver and, after gagging her, forcibly lay with her. When his evil designs had been accomplished, Pedro Iglesia went to\u00a0 watch the husband and Juan\u00a0 Valdez did likewise forcibly\u00a0 lay with Dorotea de la Cruz.\u00a0\u00a0 Juan Valdez took Dorotea\u00a0 de la Cruz to\u00a0 the town, but upon approaching the railway station he was caught by the <i>teniente <\/i>of the barrio. Pedro Iglesia was arrested by the\u00a0 police in Nagtuturican itself.\"<\/blockquote>The Attorney-General in his brief, makes a careful analysis\u00a0 of the evidence and\u00a0 recommends that the sentence of the lower court be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>The lower court, in\u00a0 sentencing the defendants took into consideration the aggravating circumstances of astucia and <i>despoblado,<\/i> with the extenuating circumstance of article 11 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 After a careful\u00a0 examination of\u00a0 the evidence and considering the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime and the character\u00a0 of the defendants,\u00a0 we are of the opinion\u00a0 that they\u00a0 are not entitled to the benefit of the extenuating circumstance of article\u00a0 11 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 It is difficult to imagine how men who call themselves men could secure the consent of their consciences\u00a0 to commit a crime in\u00a0 the manner in which these defendants committed\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime\u00a0 with\u00a0 which\u00a0 they\u00a0 are charged.\u00a0 In addition to the\u00a0 aggravating\u00a0 circumstances taken into consideration by\u00a0 the lower\u00a0 court, we are\u00a0 of the opinion that the aggravating circumstance of <i>\"ignominia,\"<\/i> provided for in paragraph 12 of article\u00a0 10 of the Penal\u00a0 Code, should be considered as an aggravating\u00a0 circumstance.\u00a0\u00a0 Considering the\u00a0 three aggravating\u00a0 circumstances of\u00a0 <i>astucia, despoblado\u00a0 and ignominia, <\/i> and\u00a0 the absence of\u00a0 any extenuating circumstances, we are of the opinion that the sentence\u00a0 of the lower court should\u00a0 be modified and that each of the defendants should be sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of seventeen years four months and\u00a0 one day of <i>reclusion temporal,<\/i>\u00a0 to indemnify\u00a0 Dorotea de la Cruz, jointly and severally,\u00a0 in the sum of P500, with the accessories of the law,\u00a0 each to pay one-half the costs.

He fears, therefore, that if the court proceeds to judgment on appeal without having\u00a0 all the\u00a0 evidence before it, the judgment of the lower court may be reversed and\u00a0 the case sent back for a new trial merely because of defects\u00a0 in the findings\u00a0 of fact by the trial judge, although the judgment was, in fact, fully\u00a0 sustained by the evidence taken at the trial.\u00a0\u00a0 He insists that no such result would be possible had defendant brought the\u00a0 evidence here\u00a0 in\u00a0 accordance with his announced intention in\u00a0 the court below, and in accordance with the\u00a0 express terms of the bill of exceptions as certified\u00a0 and approved by the trial court.\u00a0 In support of his contention, counsel correctly says, that had appellant perfected his bill\u00a0 of exceptions\u00a0 by including therein all the evidence, then\u00a0 it would be the duty of this\u00a0 court, in the event that it found that the findings\u00a0 of\u00a0 the court\u00a0 below were\u00a0 insufficient or incorrect, to examine the evidence of record,\u00a0 and to\u00a0 decline to\u00a0 reverse the judgment\u00a0 on that ground,\u00a0 if the\u00a0 evidence itself discloses facts sufficient to sustain\u00a0 the judgment.<\/p><p>It seems clear that under the circumstances of this case the <em>appellee<\/em> should not be forced to risk a\u00a0 reversal and the delays and expense incident to a new trial, upon the mere question\u00a0 of the\u00a0 formal sufficiency of the findings of fact by the trial judge.\u00a0\u00a0 In the\u00a0 court below appellee was\u00a0 satisfied with the judgment rendered in his favor.\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant, by undertaking to make the evidence a part of the bill of exceptions, lulled him\u00a0 into\u00a0 a sense of false security as to the possibility of a reversal on the\u00a0 mere ground\u00a0 that the findings of fact by the trial court were defective or insufficient.\u00a0\u00a0 Appellant\u00a0 having announced his intention to bring the evidence here\u00a0 on appeal, appellee knew that this court, if the evidence were in fact before it, would not reverse on that ground if the evidence itself disclosed facts sufficient to sustain the judgment.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 now too late\u00a0 for\u00a0 appellee to\u00a0 secure any amendments or\u00a0 corrections of\u00a0 errors\u00a0 or omissions in the formal\u00a0 findings of\u00a0 fact by the trial court unless this court will make such corrections, and this court can not make such corrections unless the evidence is brought here for review.<\/p><p>Manifestly,\u00a0 the appellant should\u00a0 not be permitted\u00a0 to profit by a surprise sprung\u00a0 on the appellee in this\u00a0 fashion. If his failure to bring the evidence here in accordance with his announced intention is the result\u00a0 of negligence,\u00a0 he should\u00a0 not\u00a0 be permitted to profit\u00a0 unfairly thereby, and much less should he profit unfairly by a deliberate and willful\u00a0 change of his announced intention to bring the evidence here on appeal.\u00a0 Of course, if the appellant desires so to do, he should be permitted to waive his contention\u00a0 in the court below that the evidence of record does not sustain the judgment, and in that\u00a0 event,\u00a0 so far as he is concerned, it would be a wholly\u00a0 useless procedure to\u00a0 go to the expense of bringing the evidence to this\u00a0 court.\u00a0 But appellant's\u00a0 change of ground of his appeal for his own convenience\u00a0 and to save himself the expense and trouble involved in\u00a0 making the evidence a part of the record, should not be permitted to have the effect of forcing the appellee to go to judgment on appeal\u00a0 without having\u00a0 the evidence taken\u00a0 at the\u00a0 trial brought before this court, in a case where the evidence would sustain the judgment of\u00a0 the court below although the findings of fact by the trial judge are so defective or erroneous that it could not be sustained on\u00a0 them alone.\u00a0 This, because in such a case, appellee may fairly claim,\u00a0 that but for the appellant's misleading conduct in undertaking originally to bring the evidence here as a\u00a0 part of the record to be submitted\u00a0 on appeal, he, the appellee, would himself have moved the court below to so amend its findings of fact\u00a0 as to make them conform with the evidence, and to render them sufficient in form and substance to sustain the judgment.<\/p><p>It may, perhaps, be suggested, that appellee can always protect himself from danger of reversals on the ground that the findings of fact by the trial judge do not sustain\u00a0 the judgment, by always insisting on a full and correct statement of such findings, and in the event that the judge fails or declines to make such corrections as\u00a0 may be necessary, forthwith entering an appeal\u00a0 on that ground.\u00a0 But in\u00a0 the vast majority of\u00a0 judgments\u00a0 entered in the\u00a0 court\u00a0 below, such a practice would place a\u00a0 useless and vexatious burden on successful litigants in the courts below.\u00a0 It is, in general, a\u00a0 matter\u00a0 of no importance to\u00a0 a successful litigant whether the reasons on which a judgment is based are sound or not, provided\u00a0 the judgment itself\u00a0 is in\u00a0 his favor and satisfactorily disposes of the issues involved.\u00a0 If no appeal is taken, or if an appeal is taken and the appellant makes the evidence a\u00a0 part of the record, there can rarely be any\u00a0 purpose in a vexatious proceeding by a successful litigant to compel the trial judge who has rendered\u00a0 judgment in his favor to modify\u00a0 or change the reasons on which he based his decision.\u00a0 Practically, the only cases\u00a0 where it can become a matter of importance to the successful litigant in the court below to secure the amendment or correction of an imperfect finding of facts by the trial judge, are those wherein the unsuccessful litigant appeals from the judgment, and without bringing the evidence to this court,\u00a0 seeks a reversal on the ground that the facts thus found do not sustain the judgment.\u00a0 If the appellant, while\u00a0 the case is still in the court below, rests his appeal on this ground, the appellee can there and\u00a0 then,\u00a0 if\u00a0 he\u00a0 so\u00a0 desires, move the trial court to amend its defective and\u00a0 insufficient findings; and\u00a0 if\u00a0 he fails so to do he must take the consequences.\u00a0\u00a0 But if while the case is still pending in the\u00a0 court below, the appellant announces his intention to bring the\u00a0 evidence here on\u00a0 appeal, and\u00a0 after wards willfully or negligently\u00a0 declines\u00a0 to do so, thus misleading the appellee and inducing him\u00a0 to refrain from any effort to have defective\u00a0 and insufficient findings amended until it is too late to do so in the court below, we think that the appellee should be given an\u00a0 opportunity to have such amendments made in this court.<\/p><p>We are of opinion, however, that in such cases, the appellant having\u00a0 expressly\u00a0 or impliedly\u00a0 waived his\u00a0 right\u00a0 to have the evidence reviewed by this court, it then becomes the duty of the appellee to bring the\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 here, if he desires to have it reviewed for his benefit;\u00a0 that is to say, to prevent a reversal\u00a0 on the\u00a0 ground\u00a0 that the findings\u00a0 of fact by the trial judge are defective or insufficient, when a review of the evidence itself would develop facts sufficient to sustain the judgment.<\/p><p>It will be seen that the practice thus indicated in no wise affects the general rule of procedure where appellant fails or declines to bring to this court all of the evidence taken in the court below, except only\u00a0 to\u00a0 this\u00a0 extent, that in such cases, if the appellee brings the evidence here,\u00a0 we will not reverse the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 entered in the\u00a0 court\u00a0 below on the sole ground of the deficiency of the findings of fact by the trial judge,\u00a0 if the evidence itself discloses\u00a0 facts sufficient to sustain the judgment.<\/p><p>Pursuant\u00a0 to the rule of practice herein indicated, the following order will\u00a0 be entered herein:<\/p><p>Appellant having failed to include all the\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 taken in the court below in the record brought here on appeal, and not having offered any excuse for his\u00a0 failure so to do,\u00a0 the proceedings on his appeal will go forward to judgment as though no motion for a new trial, on\u00a0 the ground that the weight of the evidence does not support the judgment, had been filed in the court below; unless\u00a0 within twenty days the appellee\u00a0 perfects the record by including\u00a0 therein\u00a0 the missing testimony, in which\u00a0 event, the judgment of\u00a0 the trial court will not be\u00a0 reversed on the mere ground of the insufficiency or incorrectness of the findings of fact by the trial judge,\u00a0 if the evidence thus perfected\u00a0 discloses facts. sufficient to sustain it.\u00a0\u00a0 It is so ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

JACKSON, of Tagbilaran.\"<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>Adhering to the construction we have placed on the provisions of section 1 of Act No. 1773, touching the prosecution of the crimes of <i>adulterio, estupro,<\/i> and <i>injuria<\/i> (adultery, seduction, and slander), in the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Narvas (14 Phil. Rep., 410), with which compare the doctrine laid down in the case of the United States <i> vs.<\/i> De la Santa (9 Phil. Rep., 22), we are of opinion that the trial court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this information, that is to say, over the offense charged. The information and all the proceedings based thereon should, therefore, be dismissed.<br\/><br\/>It has been suggested that since the information in this case shows upon its face that it was filed \"at the instance\" of the aggrieved party, the object sought to be attained by the provisions of section 1 of Act No. 1773 was thereby substantially secured; that at most the institution of these proceedings by information, instead of by the filing of the complaint of the aggrieved party, was error, not prejudicial to the substantial rights of the defendant; and that no objection having been raised on that account in the court below, such objection should not be considered for the first time on appeal.<br\/><br\/>The objection in this case, however, goes directly to the jurisdiction of the court. Jurisdiction over the crime of injuria is expressly denied to the court in these Islands by the above-cited provisions of section 1 of Act No. 1773, unless such jurisdiction is conferred by the filing of a complaint by the aggrieved party, his parents, grandparents, or guardian. In the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Narvas (14 Phil. Rep., 410), we held that the complaint referred to in this section is a sworn written statement as defined in section 4 of General Orders, No. 58. The information upon which these proceedings were instituted was not such a complaint, and there can be no doubt, therefore, that the court below was without jurisdiction to proceed upon that information. An objection based on the lack of jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of the proceedings either in the court below or on appeal, and, indeed, courts do not hesitate to dismiss proceedings <i>ex mero motu<\/i> whenever it clearly appears that the subject matter is not within their jurisdiction, as in the case at bar. Jurisdiction over the subject matter in a criminal case can not be conferred upon the court by the accused, by express waiver or otherwise, since such jurisdiction is conferred by the sovereign authority which organized the court, and is given only by law in the manner and form prescribed by law.

Property of public ownership is - <br\/><br\/>\"1.

The possessor may lose his possession -<br\/><br\/>\"1. By the abandonment of the thing.<br\/><br\/>\"2. By transfer to another for a good\u00a0 or valuable consideration.<br\/><br\/>\"3. By the destruction or total loss of the thing or by the thing becoming unmarketable.<br\/><br\/>\"4. By the possession of another, even against the will of the former possessor, if the new possession\u00a0 has lasted more than one year.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Under these provisions of the code it seems quite clear that if the Government is justified in disturbing the\u00a0 possession of the applicants, it can only be on the ground\u00a0 that they have abandoned their property, or that it has been totally destroyed and has now become a part of the public domain by the erosive action of the sea. It is\u00a0 quite clear that applicants have never. abandoned their\u00a0 possession\u00a0 under a claim of ownership of\u00a0 this land.\u00a0 And we think the facts above stated fully sustain a finding that there has been no such destructive or total loss\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 property\u00a0 as\u00a0 would Justify\u00a0 a holding\u00a0 that the\u00a0 owners have lost possession. Doubtless the property has been injured by the erosive action of the sea.\u00a0\u00a0 Doubtless the owners in order to profitably enjoy the possession of this property will be compelled to make some, relatively small expenditures by way of\u00a0 a\u00a0 \"fill\" or a retaining wall.\u00a0 But the actual condition of the property as it appears from the record makes a claim that it has been totally lost or destroyed preposterous and wholly untenable.\u00a0 We need\u00a0 hardly add that if the applicants have not lost their right of\u00a0 possession, the Government's claim of ownership, on the ground that this land is a part of the <i> playa<\/i> (shore) of Manila Bay, necessarily falls to the ground.<br\/><br\/>We should\u00a0 not be understood, by this decision, to hold; that in\u00a0 a case of gradual encroachment or erosion by the ebb and flow of the tide, private property may not become \"property of public ownership,\" as defined\u00a0 in article 339 of the code, where it appears that the owner has to all intents and purposes abandoned\u00a0 it and permitted it to\u00a0 be totally destroyed, so as to\u00a0 become a part of the \"playa\"\u00a0 (shore of the sea), \"rada\"\u00a0 (roadstead), or the like.\u00a0 Our ruling in this\u00a0 case is merely that it\u00a0 affirmatively appears that the owners of the land in question have never in\u00a0 fact nor\u00a0 in intent abandoned it, and that keeping in mind its location and actual condition it can not be said to have\u00a0 been totally\u00a0 destroyed for the purposes for which it was held by them, so as to have become a part of the playa\u00a0 (shore)\u00a0 of the Bay of Manila.<br\/><br\/>The decree entered by the lower court should be affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

and, finally, after the said adjudication and during the same year, 1897, Andueza conveyed all his rights in the property to Eugenio Otivar for the consideration of 1,800 pesos which the vendee paid him as the price\u00a0 thereof, whereupon Otivar immediately took possession of the property in which he was succeeded by his heirs, represented by\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 as\u00a0 the judicial administratrix of his estate, after his death.<br\/><br\/>Without directly\u00a0 impugning\u00a0 the\u00a0 preceeding facts,\u00a0 the plaintiff maintains that the property in\u00a0 question was never owned by Lao-Ciengcay, but by the Chinaman Valentin Garcia Lao-Juico, the father of them both; that, the said Lao- Juico\u00a0 having died in 1890, his three sole heirs,\u00a0 who were the plaintiff,\u00a0 the\u00a0 aforementioned\u00a0 Lao-Ciengcay\u00a0 and\u00a0 the latter's\u00a0 brother, Lao-Joco, by\u00a0 common accord and extra- judicially, made a partition of the estate left by the said deceased, whereby the plaintiff received as his share, among other\u00a0 property,\u00a0 the house and lot\u00a0 in\u00a0 question, the\u00a0 possession\u00a0 of which he\u00a0 assumed in June, 1892, and\u00a0 continued therein\u00a0 until the year\u00a0 1897,\u00a0 when he was obliged to give it up because the Court of First Instance of Albay ordered, on the petition of Cipriano Andueza, the attachment of\u00a0 the properties of\u00a0 Lao-Ciengcay,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the said\u00a0 house and\u00a0 lot were attached by mistake, instead of the property adjoining thereto belonging to Lao-Ciengcay.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, in proof of\u00a0 his allegations,\u00a0 presented a private\u00a0 instrument\u00a0 containing a\u00a0 record of the partition made\u00a0 between himself\u00a0 and his\u00a0 brothers, Lao-Ciengcay and Lao-Joco, of the estate left by their father, Valentin Garcia, which instrument appears to have been signed by the said three\u00a0 brothers and several witnesses and bears the date of June 15,\u00a0 1892.\u00a0\u00a0 No notary, or other public official vested with the\u00a0 authority to\u00a0 administer oaths judicially or extra- judicially, intervened\u00a0 in the execution of the said instrument.\u00a0 That document contains a clause\u00a0 as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"For the purpose of avoiding dissensions among the three brothers,\u00a0 to the eldest of them, Lao-Ciengcay, are awarded the\u00a0 house where\u00a0 his\u00a0 father's\u00a0 business is established\u00a0 and which is in front of the church;

and\u00a0 it shall\u00a0 be his duty to assume all\u00a0 liability for the debts which\u00a0 may be found to have been contracted by the said deceased, Valentin\u00a0 Garcia, and are yet unpaid, which debts,\u00a0 it appears, amount to 2,000 more or less.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On the\u00a0 supposition\u00a0 that the house adjudicated to\u00a0 the plaintiff in the\u00a0 aforesaid partition, and which is certainly not\u00a0 described therein\u00a0 in a\u00a0 manner\u00a0 sufficient\u00a0 for its identification,\u00a0 is\u00a0 the same one\u00a0 concerned in this\u00a0 suit,\u00a0 there would arise the question, one of law, relative to the probative force of the\u00a0 aforementioned instrument\u00a0 of partition with respect\u00a0 to third persons.<br\/><br\/>Article\u00a0 1227 of the Civil Code provides\u00a0 as follows :<br\/><blockquote>\"The date\u00a0 of a private\u00a0 instrument shall be considered, with regard to third persons, only from the date on which it\u00a0 may\u00a0 have\u00a0 been filed or entered\u00a0 in a public registry, from the death of any of those who signed it, or from\u00a0 the date\u00a0 on which\u00a0 it may\u00a0 have been\u00a0 delivered to\u00a0 a public official by virtue of his office.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The partition\u00a0 referred to was made;\u00a0 as\u00a0 aforesaid, by means of\u00a0 a private\u00a0 instrument, and there is no proof of any\u00a0 kind, nor was even so much as\u00a0 an attempt made\u00a0 for its production, that such an\u00a0 instrument was filed or entered in any\u00a0 public\u00a0 registry or delivered\u00a0 to any\u00a0 public official by virtue\u00a0 of his office; neither is it shown, if\u00a0 any of those who\u00a0 signed it have died, when their death took place, with the result, therefore, that the date of the said instrument was\u00a0 not established\u00a0 by any\u00a0 of the means prescribed in the legal provision above transcribed, until that instrument was\u00a0 presented\u00a0 in the present suit.\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently the age of the instrument in question can not be considered, according to the said\u00a0 article 1227, with respect to Eugenio Otivar and\u00a0 his\u00a0 heirs,\u00a0 as\u00a0 third persons,\u00a0 on account of their not having intervened\u00a0 in\u00a0 its execution, in any capacity, except from the date of\u00a0 its\u00a0 presentation in these proceedings, which was effected\u00a0 in 1907, almost ten years after the sale of the house in question at public auction, and\u00a0 its acquisition by the said Otivar at the end of the year 1897.\u00a0 Whatever, then, be the\u00a0 intrinsic force which\u00a0 it may be desired to attribute to\u00a0 the act recorded\u00a0 in the instrument in question,\u00a0 it is evident that it can not affect Otivar's acquisition aforementioned, because such instrument, as\u00a0 regards its legal\u00a0 effects\u00a0 and with relation\u00a0 to\u00a0 that act,\u00a0 must\u00a0 be considered as having\u00a0 been executed\u00a0 only in\u00a0 1907, on which date\u00a0 more than nine\u00a0 years had already elapsed since the said\u00a0 Otivar\u00a0 had acquired\u00a0 the property\u00a0 and\u00a0 entered into its possession\u00a0 by virtue of the\u00a0 purchase\u00a0 effected\u00a0 by him from\u00a0 Cipriano\u00a0 Andueza.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 date\u00a0 of\u00a0 a private instrument does not operate to the prejudice of third persons, until after its\u00a0 certification made in\u00a0 some of the ways expressed in the article of the Civil Code hereinbefore mentioned.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff\u00a0 alleges that the\u00a0 fact recorded\u00a0 in the possessory information title, by reason of which title the disputed property was entered in\u00a0 the property\u00a0 registry in the name of\u00a0 Lao-Ciengcay, to\u00a0 the\u00a0 effect\u00a0 that\u00a0 the latter acquired\u00a0 the house\u00a0 and\u00a0 lot in question by purchase\u00a0 from Andres Garcia in ,1864,\u00a0 is false,\u00a0 inasmuch as in that year the said\u00a0 Lao-Ciengcay\u00a0 was not yet born, as\u00a0 shown by the possessory\u00a0 information wherein\u00a0 it is stated that he was only thirty years old\u00a0 in\u00a0 1896.\u00a0\u00a0 With regard\u00a0 to this point, the defendant stated that some clerical error\u00a0 must have been committed in\u00a0 recording Lao-Ciengcay's age. Be this as it\u00a0 may, it does not alter the legal phase of the\u00a0 question.\u00a0 Leaving\u00a0 aside the said possessory\u00a0 information, it has been established that the property in question was attached and sold\u00a0 at\u00a0 public auction in 1897, by order of a competent\u00a0 public official, as the property of Lao-Ciengcay; that as such it was judicially awarded to Cipriano Andueza, and that the latter sold it in turn in the same year, 1897, to Eugenio Otivar, who held possession thereof from that date as owner, and, after his death, his heirs, represented by\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 in\u00a0 this suit. Supported by\u00a0 such titles, Otivar and\u00a0 his heirs must\u00a0 be\u00a0 legally considered as the legitimate owners and possessors\u00a0 of the property so long as no\u00a0 other person\u00a0 proves a better right to the ownership\u00a0 and possession of\u00a0 the same.\u00a0 The plaintiff has\u00a0 not proved that he has a better right to such ownership and possession,\u00a0 for the reason\u00a0 that\u00a0 the private\u00a0 instrument on\u00a0 which he\u00a0 endeavors to found his claim as the legitimate owner of\u00a0 the said property at the time it was attached and judicially sold can not be considered as having been executed,\u00a0 in so far as it tends to oppose the rights of Otivar and his heirs, until\u00a0 after the date thereof was duly certified, which was effected only in 1907, that is to say, nine years after\u00a0 the completion of the attachment and sale before mentioned. Having reached this conclusion, we do not deem it necessary to decide the other questions set up in the respective briefs of the plaintiff and the\u00a0 defendant.<br\/><br\/>It is stated in\u00a0 the judgment appealed from that \"it has been clearly proved\u00a0 that the plaintiff was in possession of the house and lot in question in good faith from the year 1892 until the year 1897, when he was dispossessed against his will and without being given an opportunity to defend his right.\"\u00a0 Considering\u00a0 the question\u00a0 from the\u00a0 point of view of the right of possession, it has already been shown that the plaintiff has not proved\u00a0 that he has a better\u00a0 right than the defendant; and, with respect to actual possession, it is\u00a0 evident\u00a0 that the plaintiff\u00a0 lost\u00a0 it\u00a0 after one year's adverse possession by Otivar,\u00a0 pursuant to the provisions of article 460 of the Civil\u00a0 Code, which provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>'The possessor may lose his possession\u2014<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * <br\/><\/div><br\/>\"4.\u00a0 By the possession of another, even against the will of the former possessor,\u00a0 if the new possession has lasted more than one year.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>With a reversal of the\u00a0 judgment appealed from, the defendant is\u00a0 absolved from the complaint, without\u00a0 express finding as to the costs of both instances.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.J., Torres, Carson<\/i>, and<i> Moreland, JJ., <\/i>concur.<\/div>",

This opium was not manifested and was imported without the knowledge or consent\u00a0 of either the customs authorities or the owners or managers of the steamer <i>Kaifong.<\/i>\u00a0 The opium was not only imported into the\u00a0 Philippine Islands in violation of\u00a0 the Customs Administrative Act, but also in violation of\u00a0 Act No. 1761, known as the Opium Law, which was then in full force and effect and which prohibits the importation of opium, in any\u00a0 form,\u00a0 into the\u00a0 Philippine Islands\u00a0 by persons not duly authorized to do so.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing facts have not only been established by the testimony of Lao Loc Hing, who gave a detailed\u00a0 statement of everything which occurred with reference to the importation of this\u00a0 opium, but also by the testimony of\u00a0 one Apao, a stoker on the steamer Kaifong,\u00a0 who testified that he assisted Lao Loc Hing, on the night the opium was delivered to the defendant, in letting same down over the ship's side into the defendant's <i>baroto.<\/i>\u00a0 Other witnesses testified that they purchased from the defendant large quantities\u00a0 of opium about that time.<br\/><br\/>The defendant attempted to establish an\u00a0 alibi and testified\u00a0 that he was not in\u00a0 the town of Cebu on\u00a0 the night of October 31,\u00a0 1908; that he left Cebu\u00a0 on\u00a0 the morning of the 31st and did\u00a0 not return until the afternoon\u00a0 of\u00a0 the 1st of November.\u00a0 He\u00a0 admitted that he was\u00a0 at that time an employee of Smith, Bell &amp; Co. and that his duty was to look after the discharging of merchandise from the steamer <i>Kaifong,<\/i> but that at\u00a0 this particular time he had obtained permission from his employers to visit another town.\u00a0 This alibi\u00a0 was completely\u00a0 destroyed by documentary\u00a0 evidence. The prosecution showed by\u00a0 a number\u00a0 of receipts signed by the defendant himself, and bearing date\u00a0 of October\u00a0 31, 1908, that he was on\u00a0 that particular date looking after\u00a0 the discharge of\u00a0 that cargo; that he was\u00a0 on the steamer at the time and receipted\u00a0 for the\u00a0 merchandise as it left\u00a0 the ship's side.<br\/><br\/>The sentence imposed by the learned trial\u00a0 court, under all the facts and circumstances, is not excessive, especially when we take into consideration the gravity of the offense committed.\u00a0\u00a0 The judgment\u00a0 appealed\u00a0 from\u00a0 is,\u00a0 therefore, affirmed: Provided, That in case of insolvency the defendant shall\u00a0 suffer\u00a0 the corresponding\u00a0 subsidiary\u00a0 imprisonment.

Low presiding, convicting the defendant of the crime of malversation of public funds and sentencing\u00a0 him to\u00a0 two months' imprisonment,\u00a0 to\u00a0 perpetual disqualification to hold\u00a0 public office or public employment of any kind,\u00a0 and to the payment of the\u00a0 costs.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the proofs\u00a0 of the\u00a0 prosecution that the accused as\u00a0 justice of\u00a0 the\u00a0 peace of Baggao,\u00a0 Province of Cagayan, on the 2d\u00a0 day of October, 1909, had before him sixteen separate civil cases commenced by Juan Canillas against sixteen distinct individuals, each\u00a0 one\u00a0 for damages resulting from a breach of contract; that said\u00a0 cases were all decided by the appellant in favor of the plaintiff; that each one of the defendants\u00a0 in\u00a0 said\u00a0 cases appealed\u00a0 from the decision of the justice of the peace and deposited P16 as required by law, at the same time giving a\u00a0 bond of P50, each one of which was approved by the court;\u00a0 that on the 12th day of said month\u00a0 the plaintiff in said\u00a0 cases presented a writing to the appellant as said justice of the peace, alleging that\u00a0 the sureties on the\u00a0 said bonds\u00a0 were insolvent and\u00a0 later demonstrated\u00a0 this to the\u00a0 satisfaction of the appellant; that thereupon the latter ordered the cancellation of the said bonds and, in the same order,\u00a0 required each of\u00a0 the appellants to file\u00a0 another bond within fifteen days; that, inasmuch as none of the appellants in\u00a0 said causes presented new bonds within the time fixed, the plaintiff\u00a0 in said causes applied to the appellant, as said court, for\u00a0 an order declaring final the\u00a0 judgment entered in each of the said sixteen\u00a0 cases\u00a0 and commanding the execution of the same, at the\u00a0 same time\u00a0 asking that the sums deposited by the defendants in\u00a0 said\u00a0 actions be attached (so called in the record) and delivered to him in satisfaction of said judgments; that the accused acceded to the petition of the plaintiff, ordered said\u00a0 sums attached and delivered same to the plaintiff, at the same time requiring of the plaintiff a bond of T50 for each attachment, conditioned that he would respond for the damages which should result from such attachment.<br\/><br\/>After\u00a0 this attachment (so\u00a0 called)\u00a0 the attorney for the defendants in the said sixteen cases presented a complaint against the appellant to the\u00a0 Court of First\u00a0 Instance, by virtue of which said\u00a0 court ordered that the plaintiff, Juan Canillas, deliver to the clerk of the Court of First Instance the sums deposited by the defendants in said actions. Canillas\u00a0 obeyed\u00a0 the order of the court and made the\u00a0 delivery as required.<br\/><br\/>Upon these\u00a0 facts\u00a0 the Acting\u00a0 Attorney-General recommends the acquittal of the accused.\u00a0 We are in entire accord with that recommendation.\u00a0 The case made\u00a0 against\u00a0 the appellant\u00a0 lacks many of the\u00a0 essential elements\u00a0 required by law to be present in the crime of malversation of public funds.\u00a0 The accused did not convert the money to his own use or to the use of any other person; neither did he feloniously permit anybody else\u00a0 to\u00a0 convert\u00a0 it.\u00a0\u00a0 Everything he did was\u00a0 done in good faith under the belief that he was acting judicially and correctly.\u00a0 The fact\u00a0 that\u00a0 he\u00a0 ordered the sums, deposited in his\u00a0 hands by the\u00a0 defendants - appellants\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 sixteen\u00a0 actions referred to, attached for the benefit of the plaintiff in those actions, after the appeals had been dismissed and the judgments in his court had become\u00a0 final, and that he\u00a0 delivered the said sums to the plaintiff\u00a0 in satisfaction of the\u00a0 judgment which he held iny those cases, can not be\u00a0 considered an\u00a0 appropriation or a taking of said sums within the meaning of Act No.\u00a0 1740. He believed that, as presiding officer of the court of justice of the peace, he had a perfect right under the law to cancel the bonds when it was clearly shown to him that the sureties thereon were insolvent, to require the filing of new undertakings,\u00a0 giving the parties ample time\u00a0 within which\u00a0 to do so, to dismiss the appeals in case said undertakings were not filed,\u00a0 and\u00a0 to\u00a0 declare the judgment final.\u00a0 He believed that after said appeals had been dismissed and said\u00a0 judgment had become final,\u00a0 the sums\u00a0 deposited were subject to be applied in payment of the judgments in the actions in which said sums had been\u00a0 deposited and that\u00a0 he was acting judicially and legally in\u00a0 making such applications.<br\/><br\/>To constitute\u00a0 a crime, the\u00a0 act must, except in certain crimes made such by statute, be accompanied by a criminal intent, or by such negligence or indifference to duty\u00a0 or to consequences,\u00a0 as, in law, is equivalent to\u00a0 criminal intent. The maxim is,<i> actus non facit reum, nisi nisi\u00a0 rea <\/i>- a crime is not committed if the mind of the person performing the act complained of be innocent.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar the appellant was engaged in exercising the functions of a court of justice of the\u00a0 peace.\u00a0\u00a0 He had jurisdiction of the actions\u00a0 before\u00a0 him.\u00a0 He\u00a0 had\u00a0 a\u00a0 right and it was his duty to require the payment by each appellant of P16, as well as the giving of a proper undertaking with solvent\u00a0 sureties.\u00a0\u00a0 While, in dismissing the appeals and delivering the ?256 to the plaintiff in said cases, he may have exceeded his authority as such court and passed beyond the\u00a0 limits of\u00a0 his jurisdiction and power, a question we do not\u00a0 now discuss or decide, it was, so\u00a0 far as appears from the\u00a0 record, at most a\u00a0 pure mistake of judgment, an error of the mind operating upon a state of facts.\u00a0\u00a0 Giving the act complained of the\u00a0 signification most detrimental to the appellant,\u00a0 it,\u00a0 nevertheless, was\u00a0 simply the result of the erroneous\u00a0 exercise of\u00a0 the judicial function, and not\u00a0 an intention to deprive any person of his\u00a0 property feloniously. His\u00a0 act had back of it the\u00a0 purpose to do justice to litigants and\u00a0 not to embezzle property.\u00a0 He acted that honest debts might be paid to those to whom they were legally and justly due, and not to enrich himself or another by criminal misappropriation.\u00a0\u00a0 It was\u00a0 an error committed\u00a0 by a court,\u00a0 not an act done by a criminal-minded man.\u00a0 It was a mistake, not\u00a0 a crime.<br\/><br\/>It is true that a presumption of criminal\u00a0 intention\u00a0 may arise from proof of the\u00a0 commission\u00a0 of a\u00a0 criminal\u00a0 act; and\u00a0 the\u00a0 general rule is that, if\u00a0 it is\u00a0 proved that the accused committed the criminal act charged, it will be\u00a0 presumed that the act was done with criminal\u00a0 intention, and that it is for\u00a0 the accused to rebut this presumption.\u00a0\u00a0 But it must be borne in mind that the act from which such presumption springs must\u00a0 be a criminal act. In the\u00a0 case before us the\u00a0 act was\u00a0 not\u00a0 criminal.\u00a0 It may have been an error; it may\u00a0 have been wrong and illegal in the sense that it would have been\u00a0 declared\u00a0 erroneous and set aside on appeal or other proceeding in the superior court.\u00a0 It may well\u00a0 be that his\u00a0 conduct was arbitrary to a high degree, to such a degree in fact as properly to subject him to reprimand or even suspension or removal\u00a0 from office.\u00a0 But, from the facts of record, it was not criminal.\u00a0 As a necessary result no presumption of criminal intention arises from the act. \u00a0<br\/><br\/>Neither\u00a0 can the presumption\u00a0 of a criminal\u00a0 intention arise from the act complained of, even though\u00a0 it be admitted that the crime, if any, is that of malversation of public\u00a0 funds\u00a0 as defined, and\u00a0 penalized in Act\u00a0 No. 1740. It is true that that Act provides that \"In all prosecutions for violations of the preceding section, the absence of any of the\u00a0 public funds or property of which any person described in\u00a0 said\u00a0 section has charge,\u00a0 and any failure or inability of such person to produce all the funds and property properly in his charge on the demand of any officer authorized to\u00a0 examine or inspect such person, office, treasury, or depositary shall be deemed to be<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> prima facie<\/span> evidence that such\u00a0 missing funds\u00a0 or\u00a0 property have\u00a0 been\u00a0 put to personal uses or used for personal ends by such\u00a0 person within\u00a0 the meaning of the preceding section.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless, that presumption is a rebuttable one and constitutes only a prima facie\u00a0 case against the person accused.\u00a0 If he present evidence showing that, in fact, he has not put said funds\u00a0 or property to personal uses, then\u00a0 that presumption is at an end and the prima facie case destroyed.\u00a0 In the case at bar it was unnecessary for the accused to offer any\u00a0 such evidence,\u00a0 for\u00a0 the reason that\u00a0 the people's own\u00a0 pleading alleged, and its own proofs presented, along with the criminal\u00a0 charge, <i>facts which showed, of themselves, that said money had not been put to personal uses or used for personal ends. <\/i> In other words, the prosecution\u00a0 demonstrated,\u00a0 both by the\u00a0 allegations in its information filed against the accused and by its proofs on the trial, that the absence of the funds in <i>question was not due to the personal use thereof by the accused,<\/i> thus affirmatively and completely negativing the presumption which, under the act quoted, arises from the absence\u00a0 of the funds.\u00a0 The\u00a0 presumption\u00a0 was never born.\u00a0\u00a0 It never existed.\u00a0\u00a0 The facts which were\u00a0 presented for the purpose of creating such presumption were accompanied by other facts which absolutely prevented its creation.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, if it be admitted that the crime, if. any,\u00a0 is\u00a0 that of estafa, as defined in paragraph 5 of\u00a0 article 535 of the Penal Code, then the presumption just referred to does not arise.\u00a0 Mere absence of the funds\u00a0 is not sufficient proof of conversion.\u00a0 Neither is the mere failure of the accused to turn over the funds at any given time sufficient to make even a <i>prima facie <\/i>case.\u00a0 (U. S.<i> vs.<\/i> Morales, 15 Phil. Rep:, 238; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Dominguez, 2 Phil. Hep., 580.) Conversion must be affirmatively proved, either by\u00a0 direct evidence or\u00a0 by the production of facts from which conversion necessarily follows.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Morales, <i>supra.<\/i>)<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction is reversed and the defendant ordered discharged from custody forthwith.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

Tampacan went to Hamil's assistance and\u00a0 struck Saliling across the shoulder with his barong, separating his, Saliling's, body almost to the waist.\u00a0\u00a0 As a direct result of this terrific blow Saliling died instantly.\u00a0 Hamil made his escape with the trunk.\u00a0 Kaet then attacked Iddao, Saliling's wife, and\u00a0 called Tampacan, saying: \"Kill her, otherwise she will report what we have done to the\u00a0 American lieutenant.\" Tampacan then struck this woman two blows\u00a0\u00a0 with his barong, inflicting two grave wounds, one on the breast and the\u00a0 other on\u00a0 the arm.\u00a0 Immediately thereafter,\u00a0 believing that they had succeeded in killing this woman, they started after Sagdario, deceased's daughter, but she made her escape uninjured.\u00a0 On\u00a0 hearing the\u00a0 girl\u00a0 screaming\u00a0 for\u00a0 help, the defendants ran\u00a0 away, taking the trunk and its\u00a0 contents along with them.<br\/><br\/>These facts have not only been established by the direct and\u00a0 positive testimony of the wife and daughter of the deceased, to whom the defendants were well known, but also by the free and voluntary confession of Tampacan, made on and before the trial, in which he gave a detailed account of how the murder and robbery were committed. He having pointed out the place where the trunk was concealed, it was recovered and exhibited in\u00a0 court and properly identified.<br\/><br\/>The facts as above set forth constitute the complex crime of robbery with homicide,\u00a0 as defined and punished under article 502 of the Penal Code, in\u00a0 relation with paragraph 1 of\u00a0 article 503,\u00a0 which provide as follows: <br\/><blockquote>\"ART.\u00a0 502.\u00a0 Those who, with intent of profiting thereby, shall take possession of the personal property of another, with violence or\u00a0 intimidation of the person or by employing force with regard to the personal property, are guilty of the crime of robbery.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 503.\u00a0 A person guilty of robbery with violence or intimidation of,the person shall be punished:<br\/><br\/>\"1. With the penalty of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cadena perpetua<\/span> to death, if on account\u00a0 or on the occasion of the robbery there results homicide.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the commission\u00a0 of this crime there were present the generic aggravating\u00a0 circumstances set out\u00a0 in\u00a0 Nos.\u00a0 9 and 20 of article 10 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as it has been shown that the crime was\u00a0 committed in the house\u00a0 of the deceased and by the three defendants, all armed wih deadly weapons\u00a0 (barongs)\u00a0 who had\u00a0 stealthily entered the said house while the deceased and his family were asleep.\u00a0 After Hamil had secured possession of the trunk and while Saliling, who was unarmed, was engaged in trying to\u00a0 recover said trunk, he\u00a0 received the fatal blow from Tampacan.\u00a0 The defendants, taking advantage of the superior strength which their number\u00a0 and their weapons afforded them, overcame the deceased and\u00a0 took his life.\u00a0 There is abuse of\u00a0 superior strength when two or more armed men attack an unarmed person for the purpose of robbery.<br\/><br\/>We think it was error to apply nocturnity as an aggravating circumstance, for the reason that the defendants arrived at the house of the deceased just at daybreak, and when they committed this crime it was\u00a0 sufficiently light for the wife and daughter of\u00a0 said deceased to clearly and distinctly recognize and identify each one of them.\u00a0 Before this circumstance can be taken into consideration it must be shown that the defendants took advantage of the darkness of the night for the purpose\u00a0 of committing the crime\u00a0 charged.<br\/><br\/>In the absence of any of the extenuating circumstances mentioned\u00a0 in article 9 of said code, the penalty, under the provisions of No. 1, article 503, above quoted, must be imposed in its maximum degree, unless in the exercise of the discretion vested\u00a0 in\u00a0\u00a0 the\u00a0 courts,\u00a0 the\u00a0 extenuating\u00a0 circumstance of race should\u00a0 be\u00a0 taken\u00a0 into consideration in\u00a0 favor of the defendants, under the provisions of article 11 of the Penal Code, as offsetting the two aggravating circumstances above-mentioned.<br\/><br\/>\"In the\u00a0 application of the provisions of article 11, the courts may use it in their discretion to offset any number of generic aggravating circumstances.\"\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Pado, 19 Phil. Rep., Ill; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Bundal, 3 Phil. Rep., 89, and U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Montecillo, 11 Phil. Rep., 109.)<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 is always within the discretion\u00a0 of the court as to whether or not the provisions of article 11 should be applied. The defendants are all Moros, and so was the deceased.\u00a0\u00a0 We are not unmindful of their race, their lack of education, their religion, habits,\u00a0 and customs;\u00a0 nether are\u00a0 we\u00a0 unmindful of the fact that robbery with homicide is one of the gravest crimes known to our law.\u00a0 The law, without any qualifying circumstances, fixes the penalty for the commission of this crime from life imprisonment to death; in fact there\u00a0 are only four crimes with so severe a penalty, namely; robbery with homicide, treason, piracy, and\u00a0 parricide.\u00a0 The imposition of so severe a penalty for the commission of the crime of robbery with homicide is due to\u00a0 the fact that when\u00a0 men place \"filthy lucre\" above the value\u00a0 of human life they deserve to be severely punished.<br\/><br\/>The defendants in this case deliberately and coolly planned this robbery,\u00a0 and determined to secure possession of\u00a0 the goods of the deceased regardless of the consequences. They exercised\u00a0 ordinary care\u00a0 and\u00a0 intelligence\u00a0 in carrying\u00a0 out this plan.\u00a0\u00a0 They did not commit\u00a0 this crime under a heated passion, or blind impulse of the moment in defense of some real or imaginary injury to\u00a0 themselves, their families, or their\u00a0 property, but purely for gain.<br\/><br\/>Under all these facts and\u00a0 circumstances we think that, in strict justice,\u00a0 the defendants should not\u00a0 be given the benefit of the provisions of article 11 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>The judgment imposing upon\u00a0 the defendants the death penalty is hereby affirmed, with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

Rada, in the district of Tondo, city of Manila, and that.he has\u00a0 erected a house thereon flush with the boundary line\u00a0 of the adjacent property; that the plaintiffs\u00a0 are the owners\u00a0 of\u00a0 the land on both sides\u00a0 of defendant's\u00a0 house, erected as stated,\u00a0 both on Calle\u00a0 Pescadores and Calle\u00a0 P. Rada; that the\u00a0 defendant in the building of his house has\u00a0 made several openings and windows in\u00a0 the walls of the house on both sides overlooking the property of the plaintiffs;1 that at the time the defendant was building his house, and the windows and openings were being made, the plaintiffs protested, and later\u00a0 on and in the year 1905 made written protest and demand on the defendant, and the defendant received the written protest and referred it to his counsel, who, from the evidence, appears to have suggested an amicable adjustment of the matter, but the adjustment was not made,\u00a0 and this action was brought.<br\/><br\/>\"It is\u00a0 likewise established that the entrance to the defendant's house is\u00a0 in Calle Pescadores, and\u00a0 taking it\u00a0 as the front of his house he has put a large window in\u00a0 its upper story, on the balcony of said house, marked 1\u00a0 on Exhibit A, overlooking\" Calle P. Rada; and that this window and\u00a0 its balcony do not face directly toward the house of the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>\"There have\u00a0 also been constructed two windows in the rear wall of the house of the defendant, in the first story of the house, which are marked 8 and 9 on Exhibit A, and these windows are each 50 by 80 centimeters, and are placed immediately under the ceiling of the first story, and each of these\u00a0 windows is equally divided into four panes.<br\/><br\/>\"On the right hand side of the house, entering from Calle Pescadores, there is a window or opening in the wall of the house in\u00a0 the second\u00a0 story, which is about 25\u00a0 by 35 centimeters, and\u00a0 is located a little more than half way from the floor of the ceiling of the second story and this is subdivided into smaller panes; and on the same side there are three windows which\u00a0 are marked 2, 3, and 4 on Exhibit A, located immediately under the ceiling of the first story, and each of the three is\u00a0 25 by 25 centimeters.<br\/><br\/>\"There are two other\u00a0 windows on the same side located immediately under the ceiling, which are marked 5 and 6 on Exhibit A and also on Exhibit C, and one of these windows is about 35 by 67 centimeters, and the other about\u00a0 75 by 90 centimeters.<br\/><br\/>\"It also appears that there\u00a0 is wire screening over\u00a0 all these openings\u00a0 or windows.<br\/><br\/>\"The law\u00a0 provides that the owner of a wall\u00a0 which is not a party wall, adjoining\u00a0 another's estate,\u00a0 may make in it windows\u00a0 or\u00a0 openings to admit light at the height of the ceiling joists, or immediately under the ceiling, thirty centimeters square, with an iron grate embedded in the wall and a wire screen.<br\/><br\/>\"In this case the windows are in a wall not a party wall adjoining plaintiff's estate, and the windows marked 2, 3, and 4, as appears on Exhibit A, are less than thirty centimeters square and have a wire screen, but there does\u00a0 not appear to be\u00a0 the iron grate embedded in the wall.<br\/><br\/>\"The windows marked 5 and 6, as indicated on Exhibit A, have a wire\u00a0 screen but are more\u00a0 than thirty centimeters square, and have not the iron grate embedded in the wall. \"The window marked 7 on Exhibit A has a wire\u00a0 screen, but is more than 30 centimeters square and has not the

thirty centimeters square. \"The window marked One on Exhibit A is located in a balcony which\u00a0 overlooks the street, and, while the premises of the\u00a0 plaintiff may be seen from\u00a0 it,\u00a0 it is not adjoining their estate.<br\/><br\/>\"The\u00a0 court finds that\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs are entitled to a decree for closing all the windows or openings in the walls of the defendant's\u00a0 house, as herein before described, which directly overlook the premises of the plaintiffs, or that in some other way the provisions of the law be complied with so that they may remain open.<br\/><br\/>\"All these openings and windows can be made to comply with the\u00a0 law, with the exception of that marked 7, which is not immediately under the ceiling\u00a0 (<i>techo<\/i>).<br\/><br\/>\"Let judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs,\u00a0 Severina and\u00a0 Flora Choco, and against the defendant, Isidro Santamaria, forever prohibiting the opening of

the costs of the action.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The plaintiffs appealed\u00a0 from that judgment and allege in their appeal in this instance:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>That\u00a0 the\u00a0 lower court erred by not ordering in his judgment the final and perpetual closing of the large\u00a0 window opened in the balcony\u00a0 of the back part of the appellee's house\u00a0 and\u00a0 marked No. 1\u00a0 in the photographic Exhibits A and D, on the ground that the said window is in the balcony which overlooks Calle Padre Rada and that, though the appellants' lot can be seen from this\u00a0 window, it is not contiguous to\u00a0 the Iatter's property.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That the trial court also erred in ordering in his judgment that\u00a0 the\u00a0 openings and windows, Nos. 2, 3,\u00a0 4,\u00a0 5, 6, 8, and 9, might continue open if they were fixed so as to comply with the requirements\u00a0 of the law as regards\u00a0 their dimensions\u00a0 and the\u00a0 placing of iron\u00a0 grates\u00a0 embedded in the wall.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>\u00a0That the lower court\u00a0 also erred in denying the appellants' petition for\u00a0 a rehearing.<\/li><\/ol>It appears obvious to us, from the evidence,\u00a0 that the window No. 1, referred to in the first assignment of errors, is next to\u00a0 the appellants'\u00a0 lot.\u00a0\u00a0 To judge from the photographic views, Exhibits A\u00a0 and\u00a0 D, it opens on the boundary line between the said lot and\u00a0 that\u00a0 of the appellee and is situated\u00a0 perpendicularly above a\u00a0 part\u00a0 of the wall\u00a0 that belongs to\u00a0 the appellants.\u00a0 This\u00a0 opinion is\u00a0 corroborated by the testimony of the defendant's witness who\u00a0 took the said photographs,\u00a0 in\u00a0 so far as\u00a0 he said that \"a part of the window in\u00a0 question is in front of the plaintiffs' property, and a\u00a0 person approaching\u00a0 the window may clearly see the said lot.\"\u00a0\u00a0 And\u00a0 certainly if it\u00a0 is in front of this\u00a0 lot,\u00a0 it is unquestionable that it directly overlooks the same;\u00a0 but\u00a0 even though it did not and only\u00a0 a side or oblique view of the lot could be obtained\u00a0 from it,\u00a0 it could\u00a0 not be kept open, since between it and the plaintiffs' property there does not intervene the distance\u00a0 required by law - that\u00a0 of two meters in the first case, and 60 centimeters in the second.\u00a0 In reality, there is no distance at all between the said window and the plaintiffs' lot, because, as we have said, this window is perpendicular to the boundary line of the said lot; therefore, its opening is a\u00a0 manifest\u00a0 violation\u00a0 of the provisions\u00a0 of article 582 of the Civil Code which reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Windows with direct views, or balconies or any similar openings projecting over the estate\u00a0 of the neighbor, can not be made if there is not a distance of, at least,\u00a0 2\u00a0 meters between the wall in which they are built and said\u00a0 estate.<br\/><br\/>\"Neither can side nor oblique views be opened over said property, unless there is a distance of\u00a0 60 centimeters.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Because of the lack\u00a0 of the distance required by law, the window\u00a0 in question must be closed,\u00a0 and consequently the judgment appealed from\u00a0 should be modified in this sense, as regards this window.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the second assignment of error, the question raised\u00a0 by the appellants\u00a0 concerns the proper interpretation of article 581 of the Civil Code which prescribes as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The owner of a wall which is not a party-wall, adjoining another's estate,\u00a0 may\u00a0 make in it windows or\u00a0 openings\u00a0 to admit\u00a0 light, at the height of the ceiling joists or\u00a0 immediately\u00a0 under the ceiling, of the dimensions\u00a0 of 30 centimeters square and, in any case, with an iron grate embedded in the\u00a0 wall and a\u00a0 wire screen.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The\u00a0 windows mentioned, in this part of the appeal are those indicated by Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9, in the defendant's Exhibit A.\u00a0\u00a0 They are\u00a0 all\u00a0 situated immediately under the ceiling of the first floor and are provided with wire screens; some of\u00a0 them measure more and others less than 30 centimeters square\u00a0 and none of them have iron\u00a0 grates embedded in the wall.\u00a0 Owing\u00a0 to this\u00a0 last circumstance, none of them fully comply with the conditions\u00a0 required by law; moreover, those\u00a0 numbered\u00a0 5, 6, 8, and 9, have the additional defect\u00a0 of\u00a0 being\u00a0 greater than\u00a0 30\u00a0 centimeters square.\u00a0\u00a0 The trial judge therefore ordered, in the judgment,\u00a0 that\u00a0 all the aforementioned\u00a0 windows\u00a0 be closed\u00a0 or that they be made to conform to the law with respect to their dimensions and the placing of iron grates embedded in the wall.\u00a0 The appellants maintain that these windows should have been ordered closed absolutely and finally, and, consequently, that the option allowed the defendant to keep them open, provided that he brought them within the terms of the law, is contrary to the\u00a0 same and, therefore,\u00a0 illegal.<br\/><br\/>It is alleged as a ground for such averment that none of the windows referred to are at the height of the\u00a0 ceiling joists, which is the first condition\u00a0 required by law.<br\/><blockquote>\"We understand by ceiling joists - say the appellants - in a building composed of any given\u00a0 number of stories, the long pieces to\u00a0 which are nailed the boards that form the ceiling of the <i>last <\/i>story\u00a0 of the building, counting the\u00a0 stories from below; and this interpretation which we give to the words <i>ceiling joists<\/i> must be that most in harmony with the spirit of article 581 of\u00a0 the code, the subject of our\u00a0 examination, since immediately after\u00a0 them in the\u00a0 same article, in explanation, are found the words <i>or immediately\u00a0 under 'los techos,'<\/i> in order to indicate, without the\u00a0 least\u00a0 doubt, the sole place or height\u00a0 where openings or windows may be made in conformity with the\u00a0 law.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 is needless\u00a0 to say that a building, though composed of several\u00a0 stories, can have but one <i>techo.<\/i>\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This\u00a0 last assertion\u00a0 is incorrect.\u00a0 By <i>techo <\/i> is\u00a0 understood that\u00a0 part of a construction which covers the\u00a0 rooms under it and certainly forms one of the essential parts\u00a0 of every story.\u00a0 A story is composed of earth, pavement and ceiling, the\u00a0 latter, that is, the\u00a0 ceiling, being that part\u00a0 of the story that is\u00a0 visible to the observer situated below\u00a0 in the room covered by it.\u00a0\u00a0 (Hispano-American Encyclopedic Dictionary, by Montaner and Simon.)\u00a0 Consequently, every story has a ceiling, and\u00a0 not, as\u00a0 the appellants maintain, the upper one alone.<br\/><br\/>Nor is their\u00a0 definition exact of the word <i>joists<\/i>, as it is employed in article 581\u00a0 of the Code.\u00a0\u00a0 According to the dictionary of the Spanish Academy, these are, in architecture, understood to be a kind of beam laid horizontally and serving in buildings to support others or for bracing and connecting the parts of the\u00a0 structure.\u00a0 Mucius\u00a0 Scaevola\u00a0 says in\u00a0 his Civil Code, volume 10, page 448:<br\/><blockquote>\"The horizontal timbers that are placed\u00a0 upon the\u00a0 tops of\u00a0 the uprights, that is, what are commonly called beams, intended to serve for connection and main support of the timbers of the different floors that separate\u00a0 the\u00a0 stories of the building, are called joists.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>According to\u00a0 these\u00a0 definitions each floor necessarily has joists, that is, beams, since,\u00a0 in the last analysis they are what support and secure the structure of the story immediately above; therefore it is not\u00a0 true that\u00a0 there may be joists\u00a0 only in the top story, as\u00a0 the appellants\u00a0 claim by saying that they understand to be such the long timbers to which are fastened the boards of the ceiling at the top story of the building.\u00a0 On the contrary, carefully\u00a0 considered, it is\u00a0 precisely the top story that does not need joists, since it does not have to support any other higher portion of\u00a0 the building.\u00a0\u00a0 It has only to support the\u00a0 weight of the roof,\u00a0 which is\u00a0\u00a0 undoubtedly much\u00a0 less than that\u00a0 of\u00a0 a whole story.\u00a0\u00a0 So that, according to Mucius Scaevola (work cited, vol. 10, p. 487), it can not be said that the\u00a0 top story has joists.\u00a0 And because it certainly does not have them, is the\u00a0 reason why the code in said article 581 employs the phrase or <i>immediately under \"los techos\"<\/i> in referring to the top story.<br\/><br\/>The author's\u00a0 words in\u00a0 expounding this\u00a0 theory\u00a0 in his commentary on article 581 of the Civil Code are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"We said elsewhere that these (the joists) were the\u00a0 horizontal timbers that rest upon the tops of the uprights; they form, then, the\u00a0 upper limit\u00a0 of the <i>different stories <\/i> of\u00a0 a house; and therefore,\u00a0 in referring to the top story, which can not be said to have joists, article 581 makes use of the phrase or <i>immediately under 'los techos.' \" <\/i><br\/><\/blockquote>This\u00a0 does not mean that\u00a0 the\u00a0 italicized phrase\u00a0 refers solely and exclusively\u00a0 to\u00a0 the top story, since the lower stories also have techos, as above set forth.\u00a0\u00a0 In our opinion what the author cited means is that in speaking of the top story, which has no joists, the words of article 581 of the code, <i>at the height of the ceiling joists,<\/i> fail to\u00a0 apply, the phrase or immediately under \"hs techos\" alone being thereto applicable, in distinction from the lower stories, with regard to which both phrases are applicable as they have at the same time joists and <i>techo.<\/i>\u00a0 In\u00a0 referring to\u00a0 the\u00a0 lower stories\u00a0 either phrase may,\u00a0 in connection\u00a0 with the other, determine\u00a0 the place, which surely can not be more\u00a0 than one, where it is permissible\u00a0 to\u00a0 open the\u00a0 windows\u00a0 called regulation windows, whenever in them the joists are actually joined to or placed next to the <i>techo<\/i> which forms the top of each\u00a0 of said stories.\u00a0 Both phrases therefore express the same idea with reference to\u00a0 the\u00a0 lower stories.<br\/><br\/>Aside from what\u00a0 has\u00a0 been said here, the object of the law in authorizing the opening of the windows in question in all the stories of a building, without any exception, is clear.\u00a0 Their purpose is, as article 581 itself says, to furnish light\u00a0 to\u00a0 the rooms, and it is evident at a glance that the rooms of the lower stories have as\u00a0 much need for\u00a0 light as those of the top story.\u00a0\u00a0 No good reason exists for having one story\u00a0 in\u00a0 better\u00a0 condition\u00a0 than another,\u00a0 whichever it may be, in connection with this provision\u00a0 of law.<br\/><br\/>The defendant is ordered to\u00a0 close finally and forever the window marked No. 1 in Exhibit A, the judgment appealed from\u00a0 in so far as it refers to said window being thus modified, but affirmed in all other respects; without special finding as to\u00a0 costs in this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

(2)\u00a0 that\u00a0 in August, 1906, the defendant constructed a dam\u00a0 in the said Panipuan estero within the plaintiffs' property and a canal or ditch to convey the water\u00a0 from the said estero to his fields; (3) that Gregorio Dizon, the husband of the plaintiff Eulogia Dayrit, opposed the creation of this servitude, and the defendant answered (Exhibits G and H) by stating that he,\u00a0 the defendant, had intercepted the water of an <i>estero<\/i> which belonged to nobody, but formed the boundary line between the land of the said Gregorio\u00a0 Dizon and\u00a0 that which he held under lease.\u00a0 In this answer of the defendant no right by prescription is alleged; however, the defendant's\u00a0 principal defense is that he has acquired a right to the servitude through a prescription of twenty years.<br\/><br\/>\"The witness Felix Urquico\u00a0 testified that\u00a0 he was the owner of the land held by the defendant; that he acquired the said land from one\u00a0 Telesforo Pineda, in\u00a0 June,\u00a0 1878; that since its acquisition, and\u00a0 without\u00a0 opposition, he annually constructed\u00a0 a dam in the\u00a0 same place where the defendant built one in 1906; that he conveyed the property to Juan de\u00a0 los Santos, in 1905; that in 1904,\u00a0 Saturnino Aguas,\u00a0 a lessee of his of the said land, also constructed a dam in the\u00a0 same place, without opposition; that the land previously belonging\u00a0 to\u00a0 him, and afterwards sold to the defendant, is bounded\u00a0 on the north by\u00a0 the said Panipuan <i>estero<\/i>,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that\u00a0 this\u00a0 circumstance\u00a0 was\u00a0 recorded in the private instrument\u00a0 which was executed when he acquired the said land from Telesforo\u00a0 Pineda;\u00a0 that\u00a0 prior to his occupancy of this land, it was occupied by his brother-in-law, Mariano Pamintuan, and that already, at the time it was held by the\u00a0 latter\u00a0 and by Telesforo Pineda, the said dam was constructed each year in order that they might utilize the water from the <i>estero<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"There exists a\u00a0 private instrument, not shown\u00a0 to\u00a0 have been destroyed, which would have been\u00a0 the best proof of the date when\u00a0 Felix Urquico, according to his testimony, acquired the land in question, as well as the true boundaries of the land now owned by the defendant.\u00a0 Mariano Pamintuan and Telesforo Pineda are cited.\u00a0 These parties would have thrown much\u00a0 light\u00a0 on this matter; but they did not testify and it is not known why these witnesses were not summoned to give testimony.\u00a0\u00a0 With respect\u00a0 to\u00a0 Saturnino Aguas,\u00a0 it is\u00a0 true that in\u00a0 1904 he constructed a dam in the same place where the defendant constructed his; but he was sued by Gregorio Dizon and the matter\u00a0 was settled by the defendant's agreement not to construct any more dams in the same\u00a0 place;\u00a0 and, finally, according\u00a0 to\u00a0 the rough sketch, Exhibit A, the area comprised between\u00a0 the dam, marked with the numbers\u00a0 10 and 11,\u00a0 and the boundary of the swamp\u00a0 land, marked\u00a0 5 and 6,\u00a0 belongs to the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>\"In the defendant's Exhibit No.\u00a0 1 is shown a strip of land, letters A\u00a0 and C, which he\u00a0 did not venture to state belonged to him.\u00a0 It appears unquestionable to us that this strip, planted with canas espinas, belongs to the plaintiffs, inasmuch as, according to Exhibit B, the plaintiffs' land does not adjoin the Panipuan estero on the south.\u00a0 It is maintained by\u00a0 the plaintiffs\u00a0 that the\u00a0 construction of the\u00a0 dam caused them some loss and damage.\u00a0 In regard to this, there is no proof other than that some\u00a0 clumps of canas espinas, placed in the middle of\u00a0 the <i>estero,<\/i>\u00a0 will now\u00a0 probably\u00a0 not grow on account of the stagnant water.\u00a0 There is no proof that the said clumps of\u00a0 canas espinas were destroyed, nor that\u00a0 it\u00a0 is now impossible for them\u00a0 to be utilized by their owner.<br\/><br\/>\"In view of the\u00a0 foregoing, it is ordered that\u00a0 judgment be entered restraining the defendant from preventing\u00a0 the plaintiffs'\u00a0 destroying the dam constructed\u00a0 by him\u00a0 in\u00a0 the Panipuan estero and referred to in the complaint, and from repairing damages to the property and performing\u00a0 any other act which\u00a0 may tend to preserve the property from any\u00a0 injury.\u00a0 Let it be entered\u00a0 in the judgment, furthermore, that the\u00a0 writ of\u00a0 preliminary injunction issued by this\u00a0 court\u00a0 is made\u00a0 perpetual.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 costs shall be assessed against the defendant and the plaintiffs shall be absolved from the counterclaim filed by\u00a0 the\u00a0 said defendant.\"<\/blockquote>The writ of preliminary injunction, made final in the judgment just above transcribed, was issued in the following terms:<br\/><blockquote>\"Whereas the plaintiffs, Celso Dayrit and Eulogia Dayrit, together with the latter's husband, Gregorio Dizon,\u00a0 in the above-cited case have presented\u00a0 an amended\u00a0 complaint against the defendant, Juan de los Santos, wherein, as an incidental remedy, it is\u00a0 aslced that\u00a0 a writ\u00a0 of preliminary injunction\u00a0 be issued restraining the defendant, his agents and representatives from entering upon the said\u00a0 property, making excavations thereon,\u00a0 opening ditches and building dams to intercept the water of the Panipuan estero, the said plaintiffs having furnished the bond of P500 required by this court;<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore you (the defendant), your agents and representatives, are hereby prohibited from repeating and again committing the acts above\u00a0 specified, during the trial of this case and until final judgment shall have been rendered therein.\"<\/blockquote>In the counterclaim, from which the plaintiffs were absolved, the defendant asked\u00a0 that they be sentenced to the payment of\u00a0 P500,\u00a0 the amount\u00a0 of the\u00a0 damages caused to him by the issuance of the said writ of preliminary injunction, on the\u00a0 ground\u00a0 that the said plaintiffs had no legal reason whatever to\u00a0 apply\u00a0 for the same.<br\/><br\/>As grounds for his appeal, the appellant sets forth seven assignments\u00a0 of error in his brief, of which the second and third refer only to\u00a0 questions of fact,\u00a0 and the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh\u00a0 are mere conclusions\u00a0 drawn from the premises established\u00a0 in the two former above mentioned. After\u00a0 a careful study of the evidence,\u00a0 we decide that the findings of fact contained\u00a0 in the judgment appealed from are sufficiently supported by the evidence\u00a0 and that there is no preponderance of proof\u00a0 against the\u00a0 findings\u00a0 such as might oblige\u00a0 us to modify the same,\u00a0 wherefore they must be sustained.<br\/><br\/>In the first ground of the appeal, the appellant maintains that the lower court incurred error in overruling the defendant's demurrer to the\u00a0 plaintiffs' complaint.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer is based on two grounds:\u00a0 (1) That the facts alleged\u00a0 in the complaint do not\u00a0 constitute a cause of action; and (2) that the complaint is ambiguous, unintelligible and vague.\u00a0 This last ground was abandoned\u00a0 in this instance, and\u00a0 only the first was maintained, in support of which it is stated in the appellant's brief that;<br\/><blockquote>\"The plaintiffs do not allege that the defendant\u00a0 is performing, or intends\u00a0 to perform,\u00a0 or endeavors to perform or permits the performance of, any act tending to prejudice any right of the plaintiffs in the land in question.\u00a0 They only allege that the defendant\u00a0 did\u00a0 perform\u00a0 certain acts, and it is unquestionable that a writ of injunction\u00a0 can not be issued to prohibit an act or acts already performed.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The appellant's assertion is inexact with respect to his averment\u00a0 that, in the complaint, only acts were\u00a0 alleged which were already completely performed by the defendant. It is set forth in the complaint that\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 entered upon the land belonging to\u00a0 the plaintiffs, without\u00a0 permission and against the latter's will, made excavations thereon, opened a\u00a0 ditch\u00a0 and\u00a0 built\u00a0 dams\u00a0 to\u00a0 intercept the\u00a0 natural course of the water of the Panipuan estero which\u00a0 crosses the said land, to divert such water to adjoining land held by the defendant under lease, thereby causing detriment to the plaintiffs' said property.\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint further recites, textually, that \"the defendant will continue to perform the said acts on the\u00a0 plaintiffs' property\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 unless he, his agents and other representatives are prohibited\u00a0 by the\u00a0 court\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 from\u00a0 <i>repeating\u00a0 and\u00a0 continuing\u00a0 to commit the acts above specified.<\/i>\"<br\/><br\/>From\u00a0 this, it\u00a0 is very clear that the complaint\u00a0 alleges, not only acts already effected, but also others\u00a0 which the defendant endeavored to effect by repeating or continuing those already executed\u00a0 by\u00a0 him on the\u00a0 plaintiffs' property. It being conceded that\u00a0 acts\u00a0 already consummated can not be the subject of injunction, there is no doubt\u00a0 whatever that those acts which the defendant is about to perform or intends to\u00a0 effect, whenever\u00a0 they infringe the\u00a0 plaintiffs' rights and tend to render the judgment inefficacious, can be enjoined.\u00a0\u00a0 It is, moreover, to be noted that\u00a0 not only the commission or execution of\u00a0 such\u00a0 acts, but also\u00a0 their continuation can be prevented or prohibited by the said\u00a0 injunction, according to the express terms\u00a0 of section 164 of the Code\u00a0 of Procedure in Civil Actions.\u00a0 As a consequence derived from the preceding premises, the facts alleged in the complaint constitute a right of action,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the demurrer set up by the defendant under contrary grounds was, therefore, very properly overruled.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is affirmed,\u00a0 with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

AGUAS, APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal filed by the defendant Eusebio Aguas, and carried on by his heirs, in which the special administrator of the estate of the deceased plaintiff, Maria Cuyugan, joined (p. 219 of the record), from the judgment pronounced in this case on August 22,1893. The other defendant, Telesforo Quintana, is in default.<br\/><br\/>In the proceedings instituted in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga by Mariano Aguas and others, against Maria Cuyugan, in the matter of the falsification of a will executed by Anastacio Aguas, an order was issued on August 5,1887, for the sequestration or attachment of the estate left by Anastacio Aguas at his death which was in the possession of Maria Cuyugan, and it was turned over in trust to Eusebio Aguas and Telesforo Quintana who, on giving bond, took charge of the same for administration; but, an appeal having been taken by the said Cuyugan, the Sala de lo Civil of the <i>Audiencia Territorial de Manila<\/i>, in a decision rendered on April 9, 1888, declared the sato order of attachment, and all the proceedings had in connection therewith, to be null and void, and directed that the property should be returned to the same state and condition in which it was prior to the issuance of the order on August 5 of the previous year. The trustees were, therefore, obliged to return the property to Maria Cuyugan and to render accounts of its administration.<br\/><br\/>After examining the accounts presented by the trustees, Maria Cuyugan filed a written complaint, on March 30,1889, wherein she prayed that all the objections which she had made to the accounts presented by the said trustees be admitted as just and lawful and that the latter be directed to amend the said accounts, within six days, in conformity with the objections specified in her complaint, to pay to the plaintiff such balance as should be shown by the objections to be to her credit, and to indemnify her for the damage which the bad administration of the defendants had caused her, such indemnity to be effected by the delivery to her of 8,196 pilones of sugar and 2,138 cavanes of unhulled rice, or by paying her the value thereof, P18,530, in addition to legal interest on said amount from the date of her answer to the complaint. She further asked the, court to direct the said trustees, while correcting their accounts, also to properly arrange in order and by number the documents referred to, so as not to again give rise to a troublesome and difficult task on account of the said documents being disarranged with respect to numbers and dates, many of them having no number at all. The plaintiff also asked that the costs and expenses of the trial be assessed against the defendants.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendant trustees, in their written answer, and after the allegations'therein set forth, concluded by asking that his clients be absolved from the preceding complaint, that the accounts presented be approved in all their parts, inasmuch as,some of the objections raised by the plaintiff were inaccurate and others were groundless and devoid of proof, and that the plaintiff be sentenced to pay to the defendant trustees the balance existing against her, to keep perpetual silence and to pay the costs. In the written petitions and replies both parties insisted on their respective allegations.<br\/><br\/>The court, after determining that the object of this suit was the approval or correction,of the accounts presented by the trustees, Eusebio Aguas and Telesforo Quintana, for the period of time during which they administered the property sequestered from Maria Cuyugan, and the payment of the damages occasioned to the latter by them by reason of the said administration, and after an examination of the testimony taken by both parties, decided the case upon the grounds contained in the judgment appealed from, dated August 22,1893, whereby it was declared that the objections made .by the plaintiff to the accounts presented by the said trustees, were admissible, and^ therefore, sentenced the latter to correct, within six days, the said accounts in agrees ment and accordance with the aforementioned objections; and to pay to Maria Cuyugan the balance or difference found to exist to her credit. The court likewise found in favor of the indemnity for the damages claimed, and, as it was impossible to fix the value thereof in cash or to establish any exact basis according to which such conversion should be effected, sentenced the defendants,. Telesforo Quintana and Eusebio. Aguas, to the payment of an indemnity for damages, reserving the fixing of its amount, and ordering its collection in the execution of the judgment. The defendants were also sentenced to pay the costs. From this judgment the sole defendant present appealed, in which appeal counsel for the plaintiff, who died shortly afterwards, joined, her rights being now represented by the special administrator of her estate.<br\/><br\/>As a result of the said appeal, the court, by means of a communication dated October 3; 1893, (p. 7 of the record)\u00a0 transmitted the present record of proceedings, composed of six sections, to the<i> Audiencia Territorial de Manila<\/i>, and, when received, a note was made.on page 8 thereof, in the office of the clerk of the court, of the number of sheets it contained.<br\/><br\/>During the course of the proceedings in this case had in this second instance, counsel for the defendant and appellant Eusebio Aguas, by a written motion of May 25,1894, (p. 196 of the record), asked that an order be served upon the judge of the Court of First Instancy of Pampanga directing him immediately to forward to. the <i>Audiencia <\/i>the record of the proceedings in the matter of the sequestration and trusteeship of the property left by the deceased Anastacio Aguas at his death, the 52 notebooks of the tenants of the lands sequestered from Maria Cuyugan, a book of current accounts of 62 leaves, kept by the trustees in account with the said tenants, a notarial instrument relating to facts mentioned in the written answer, two reports, of four sheets, containing statements made by the tenants, the notarial instrument presented with the complaint and setting forth the results obtained from their books and current accounts and five judicial records composed o\u00a3 902 sheets, among which there was one comprising the proceedings on the rendition and presentation of accounts, the subject matter of the present case. This petition was granted by the appellate court by a resolution of December 31, 1895, and in compliance therewith the judge of the court of Pampanga transmitted, by a communication of January 18, 1896, the record of the proceedings had in the matter of the sequestration and trusteeship,of the aforesaid property, consisting of two sections and 348 sheets, together with the records of four incidental matters, attached thereto. He likewise forwarded the 52 notebooks of the tenants of the said lands attached against Maria Cuyugan, consisting of 144 written leaves, but stated that it was impossible to transmit the record of the other proceedings, books and documents demanded, on account of their not having been found in the office of the clerk of the court, as developed from the steps taken to comply with.the written order of the higher court.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the heirs of the; deceased Eusebio Aguas, the defendant and appellant, by another; motion of February 20, 1896, asked that a new order be issued to the judge of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga directing him to proceed to search for the trial records and documents, that were not forwarded to the Atidientia, and that, in the event of their disappearance, he should bring a criminal action against whoever was responsible therefor. The said motion also contained a prayer that the hearing in this second instance be suspended until the trial records and documents demanded should be received. As the plaintiff's counsel made no objection, and assented to the foregoing motion, it was granted, and meanwhile the proceedings were suspended, according to the resolution found on page 278 of the record.<br\/><br\/>Upon petition of the appellant, the Supreme Court, by resolution of April 8, 1902; directed that a written order be issued to the judge of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga to institute a search for the records and documents aforementioned and, in case they should not be found, to make a report of the action taken by him,\u00a0 \u00a0<br\/><br\/>From the proceedings had in the Pampanga court, in search of the documents and records demanded through the means of the aforesaid orders, and reported to the clerk of this court, it appears that the said records and documents were not found, wherefore this court directed, by an order issued October 3, 1902, that the record of the proceedings just above mentioned be joined to that of this case and that the parties be notified in order that they might proceed as should best suit the protection of their rights. At this stage of the case, the counsel for the attorney Marcelino Aguas, in his own behalf and in representation of the other heirs of the deceased Eusebio Aguas, the defendant and appellant, and Mariano Cunanan, as the special administrator of the estate left by the plaintiff, Maria Cuyugan, at her death, the other defendant Telesforo Quintana remaining absent, appeared in this instance to obtain the continuation of this case and its decision.<br\/><br\/>After due consideration of the value and weight of the testimony produced by both parties, the court held that the plaintiff had proved the correctness of the objections made to the accounts presented by the defendants, notwithstanding that, owing to the destruction by white ants of some of the account sheets and vouchers pertaining thereto, it was impossible to examine and check the same, since some of the items did not appear to be duly proved, and it was conclusively shown that they included excessive and unnecessary expenses for the maintenance and the cultivation of the property administered; that the plaintiff had duly proved the facts on which she based her action, with respect to the objections made to the said accounts and the deduction that should be made in those which had been impugned, and also with regard to the indemnity for the losses and damages suffered by the plaintiff through the negligence of and abandonment by the defendants, who, on the other hand, did not prove their allegations; wherefore, after consideration of the evidence and data produced at the trial, the court regarded as demonstrated the bad administration of the trustees, who by their negligence and carelessness had given rise to the damage to the property attached, and they must therefore pay an indemnity for the products that the plaintiff failed to receive and for the deterioration and damage which have contributed to diminish the value of the property and the product of the sales, although, as there were not sufficient data to calculate exactly the amount of indemnity to be fixed, the judge merely sentenced the defendants to pay an indemnity, left undetermined, but to be assessed after appraisement and collected with the execution of the judgment. This case having been forwarded to the appellate court by virtue of an appeal taken by one of the defendants, in which the plaintiff joined, this court, in order that it may review the evidence weighed by the trial judge as the basis of the judgment appealed from, and render a decision in accordance with the law, must have before it, for examination and study, all the orders, documents and antecedents which were taken into account in first instance, together with the testimony given by both parties.<br\/><br\/>This case was conducted in conformity with the provisions of the <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil,<\/i> or law of civil procedure, and was pending appeal in this second instance when, with the change of sovereignty, the old <i>Audiencia Territorial de Manila<\/i> was abolished and the Supreme Court established by the present sovereignty, therefore, the procedure herein wad continued in accordance with the provisions of the said <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i>, as prescribed in No. 2 of section 795 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>The documents, books, and the five sections of the record of proceedings on the rendition of accounts impugned by the contrary party, not having been forwarded with the trial record, no legal means are available tot the final decision of the pending appeal, in which the plaintiff joined; inasmuch as this court, without having before it the record of the said proceedings on the rendition of accounts, and the documents and books that were not transmitted to the clerk of this court, can not review the judgment appealed from, together with the facts therein considered as proved, and the evidence adduced by both parties. In a case of incomplete record it is improper to render a conclusive and final decision that will end the contention between the parties; nor would it be possible to affirm or reverse the judgment appealed from, or to take any other legal action, on account of the lack of such evidence.<br\/><br\/>It is averred in the judgment appealed from that( the account-sheets, together with their vouchers, presented by the defendants, were destroyed by anay or white ants, but, aside from this, the absence of the book of current accounts and of the five sections of the record of proceedings on the rendition of accounts, besides the other documents demanded of the Court of First Instance, at the request of the counsel for the appellant Aguas, still prevents this court from deciding the pending appeal, according to law, inasmuch as; in order to do so, it must examine all the evidence weighed by the trial judge in pronouncing the judgment now on appeal, and review the same in connection with the grounds that support that judgment; this, in the present case, can not be done because of the lack of a large part of the said evidence which, as it is documentary, is, as generally occurs, of great importance and influence for the decision of the suit.<br\/><br\/>Not only in accordance with the provisions of the <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil <\/i>should the trial record be forwarded to the higher court, once the appeal has been admitted; together with all the antecedents in the case, the books and documents attached to the main record as exhibits, (article 662 of the <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i>,,) but this is also required by the existing law of procedure, Act No. 190, section 143, and by Act No. 1123, section 2 of which, amending the said section 143 of Act No. 190, by striking out the second paragraph and inserting in lieu thereof the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"Immediately upon the allowance of a bill of exceptions by the judge, it shall be the duty of the clerk to transmit to the clerk of the Supreme Court the original bill of exceptions and all documents which by the bill of exceptions are made a part of it. The cause shall be heard in the Supreme Court upon the bill of exceptions so transmitted, all duly certified by the clerk of the Court of First Instance.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The litigating parties themselves deemed it necessary, for the proper decision of the suit, that the said trial record and documents should be before this court, since, on the appellant's petitioning that a demand be made in writing upon the Pampanga court for the trial records, books and documents not received by the clerk of the old <i>Audiencia Territorial de Manila<\/i>, both parties agreed that this suit should remain suspended until the said desired documentary evidence was received by the court, and it was so ordered by the <i>Sala de lo Civil<\/i> in a decree issued on March 26, 1896.<br\/><br\/>It has always been considered indispensable, for the proper determination of a suit, to have in view all the data and evidence presented during the trial, as well with respect to the old laws of procedure still observed in these Islands, as with regard to the present legislation governing the conduct of suits at law, and for this reason the rules established by this court, both in decisions rendered in conformity with the old Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil and in those based on the provisions of the existing Code of Civil Procedure, have been constant and uniform. In the decision of Case No. 542, Gonzaga vs. Canete (1 Phil. Rep., 189), the rule was established that:<br\/><blockquote>\"When an action has been commenced under the former law of civil procedure and continued in accordance with the prevailing code it is impossible for the appellate court to determine the appeal upon a record which does not contain the proceedings at the trial, and in such case, to avoid the possibility of an injustice, the court will remand the case for a new trial.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In decision No. 1035, Del Carmen, widow of Bustillos, <i>vs.<\/i> Garbanzos (1 Phil. Rep., 532), the following rule was laid down:<br\/><blockquote>\"To enable the court to determine an appeal from a judgment rendered in an action tried under the former procedure it is necessary that the evidence be included in the record.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In decision No. 862, Vazquez<i> vs.<\/i> Sanchez (5 Phil. Rep., 56), it was stated as a rule that;<br\/><blockquote>\"A case tried in accordance with the former Law of Civil Procedure must, When brought to this court, contain all the evidence presented at such trial. If it does not, the judgment will, be reversed and a new trial ordered.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the decision of Case No. 3847, Ferrer<i> vs.<\/i> Neri Abejuela (9 Phil. Rep., 324), the following doctrine was likewise established:<br\/><blockquote>\"If the appellant desires the Supreme Court to review the evidence introduced at the trial, he must see that all the evidence is brought to this court on appeal. He can not bring in a part of the evidence only and then claim a reversal on the ground that the evidence presented to this court does not support the judgment.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In decision No. 5112, Breta <i>vs<\/i>. Smith, Bell &amp; Co. (15 Phil. Rep., 446), the Supreme Court ruled:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is a doctrine established and adhered to by this court, in accordance .with legal provisions in force in connection with civil procedure, and which constitutes a rule of law, that an appellant who desires to have the evidence offered at the trial reviewed in the second instance is under obligation to see that all such evidence is transmitted to the Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>\"It is not permissible to transmit only a part of the evidence adduced in the first instance and then to ask a reversal of the judgment appealed from on the ground that the evidence submitted at the trial does not sustain the decision appealed from; in such a case the appellate court must accept the facts as found by the judge, as well as the conclusions set forth in the judgment.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Although the procedure prescribed by the former law of civil procedure is different from that now followed, in the matter of appeals made from final judgments, yet it is unquestionable that if, in accordance with the former law of procedure, the complete trial record, accompanied by all the evidence and data which were considered by the court in rendering judgment, must be forwarded with the appeal, it is now no less indispensable that this should be done, in order that this court may examine and review the evidence taken at the trial, in connection with the judgment appealed from. The bill of exceptions must be submitted to us with all the evidence produced, at the petition of either party, during the hearing, for, if a part of it is missing, whether oral or documentary proof, and it is on such account deficient, the judgment appealed from can not be reviewed, and this court will be compelled to decide the case in accordance with the facts held to have been proven in the appealed judgment.<br\/><br\/>The loss or disappearance of the trial record, or of documents and evidence that are important for a proper decision of the suit, imposes the necessity of a new trial in order that the litigants may obtain full justice with respect to their controverted rights.<br\/><br\/>In volume 29, page 874, of the Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure, in treating of the grounds for the granting of a new trial, the following paragraph appears: \"New trials have been granted where a review of the case has been prevented by the loss of the files, or of instructions, or of the official stenographic notes of the proceedings.\"<br\/><br\/>This rule of procedure is supported by the principles laid down in the following decisions:<br\/><blockquote>\"Where the sentencing court has found it impossible to replace the lost record, made in a former trial, thus depriving the party who is defeated in the suit, but who is not responsible for the said loss, from maintaining his rights through an appeal, a new trial should be granted.\" (Philadelphia Fire Association <i>vs. <\/i>McNerney, decision of the court of civil appeals of Texas, of January 12, 1900; 54 S. W., 1053).<br\/><br\/>\"Where a party has, without fault or neglect on his part or his attorneys', failed to obtain a transcript for a review on error in this court, a new trial will be granted, if necessary to secure him this constitutional right.\" (Zweibel <i>vs.<\/i> Oaldwell, decision of the supreme court of Nebraska of May 18f 1904, 99 N. W., 843).<br\/><br\/>\"If it is impossible to obtain a sufficient transcript to present the errors complained of to this court, it is not proper practice to file an imperfect transcript with a petition in error, with the purpose of afterwards procuring a complete transcript and amending the petition in error, where there is no reasonable certainty of being able to procure such amended transcript. To fail to do so is not negligence that will defeat an action in equity for a new trial.\" (Zweibel vs. Caldwell et al., decision of the supreme court of Nebraska of January 5, 1905, 72 Nebr., 47, 54, 102 N. W., 84.)<br\/><\/blockquote>With the trial record in this action de mayor cuantia, no books or documents of importance were forwarded, especially the records on the rendition of accounts, the origin of the claim that is the subject of this suit, which records, documents and books, according to the investigation made by the Court of First Instance of Pampanga and the report of the clerk of that court, do not exist and could not be found in the said clerk's office, wherefore it is to be believed that they have disappeared; and as, without the missing documents, books and files, this court is unable to review all the evidence that the trial court had before him on rendering the judgment appealed from, the holding of a new trial is, of course, proper.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from is set aside and the right is reserved to the heirs or successors of the deceased plaintiff, Maria Cuyugan, to renew the claim which gave rise to these proceedings or to file a new amended complaint against the successors of the deceased trustees, Eusebio Aguas and Telesforo Quintana; and, for this purpose, the lower court shall proceed to hold a new trial in accordance with the provisions of the existing Code of Civil Procedure, and both parties may therein make use of the documents and files that are now in existence and of others which they may find of those that disappeared, as well as of the other evidence produced at the previous trial, or which may be retaken, conducive to the proper determination of this litigation. No special finding is made as to the costs. So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

It is well established that the court can not take this fact as a circumstance against\u00a0 the accused.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the fact that he did not\u00a0 testify as a witness, we may set up the premises, as a theory of the defense, that the child received the burns accidentally by having fallen, or, more specifically, that she fell out of the house through a hole in the floor and in the fall\u00a0 landed upon\u00a0 some live\u00a0 coals that had\u00a0 been placed under the house to keep the\u00a0 mosquitos away from it at night.<br\/><br\/>\"If the defendant actually\u00a0 burned the\u00a0 child and caused her death, he\u00a0 is guilty of\u00a0 a most serious crime.\u00a0 He is apparently a person of considerable intelligence and good physique, and the child, by\u00a0 reason of her age, could in no manner have defended herself; so that,\u00a0 if the\u00a0 defendant committed this crime, he did so with the absolute certainty that the child could make no defense, and that he was not exposing either his body or his life to danger\u00a0 from any act she might perform.<br\/><br\/>\"For the proper determination of this cause, the testimony of Catalina Olaso, Pedro Olayres, and Doctor Limkako, a physician, merits due consideration and careful study.<br\/><br\/>\"The witness Catalina\u00a0 Olaso is an old woman of about 60 years of age and lived\u00a0 at an approximate distance of 40 brazas from the house of the defendant and Joaquina.\u00a0 She testified that, on the\u00a0 22d of April of this year, she went down out of her house to\u00a0 a\u00a0 spot some 40\u00a0 brazas from\u00a0 Joaquina's, and that she then\u00a0 saw that the child had fire in her mouth; that her attention was called to the house by the child's\u00a0 crying; that the little girl was lying, face up, on the floor of the house, while\u00a0 Vicente\u00a0 Oro, the defendant,\u00a0 was sitting beside her, and that Vicente Oro and the child were the only persons in the house at that time.\u00a0 This witness, according to her testimony, saw the child and the defendant, from the side of the house where there was no wall of any kind or anything that might hinder their being seen.\u00a0 Witness retired to her house and did nothing in the matter, nor did she report\u00a0 to\u00a0 any authority what she had seen.\u00a0\u00a0 She explained that she made no\u00a0 report, for the reason\u00a0 that there was no other person in her house.\u00a0\u00a0 She had known the defendant but a short while before the occurrence of the crime, and had had no dealings with him.<br\/><br\/>\"The witness Pedro Olayres testified that he lived at a distance of about 30 <i>brazas<\/i> from the house of the crime, and that, on the morning of the 22d of\u00a0 April, he went out of his house and into\u00a0 the coconut grove in front of it;\u00a0 that while there he saw the child on the floor of the house,\u00a0 face down, and with fire just below her waist; that the defendant was near the child; that witness was then about 17 <i>brazas<\/i> from the house; and that he could see inside the defendant's house for the reason that there was no wall of any kind or anything on that side of the house that might prevent the defendant and the\u00a0 child from being seen.\u00a0 This witness did not denounce\u00a0 what he had seen, because, according to his testimony, the child's mother arrived a very short while afterwards.<br\/><br\/>\"For the purpose\u00a0 of refuting the testimony of these\u00a0 two witnesses for the prosecution, the defense presented the defendant's mother, who testified that Joaquina had\u00a0 called her on the morning of April\u00a0 22, telling her that the child had fallen into the fire;\u00a0 that she went there\u00a0 at about\u00a0 8 o'clock in the morning, helped the mother and the defendant to attend to the child, and that witness took the latter to her own house.<br\/><br\/>\"The defense also presented Sr. Mercader, the justice of the peace who officially visited the scene of the crime.\u00a0 This witness testified that the defendant's said house was entirely open, that is it had no wall on the east side; that the floor of the house was intact; that the house stood over a canal; that it was impossible for the child to have\u00a0 fallen into\u00a0 the canal through a hole in the floor of the house, but that if she had fallen out of the house, she necessarily must have fallen in front of the house and on level ground.\u00a0\u00a0 When\u00a0 the justice of the peace made the\u00a0 inspection, there was no\u00a0 fire under the house nor was there any sign whatever to indicate that there\u00a0 had\u00a0 been\u00a0 a fire there, but\u00a0 in the vicinity of\u00a0 the house and within a short distance from it there were signs of a fire.<br\/><br\/>\"Doctor Limkako described the burns\u00a0 that he found on the child's body (pp. 11 and\u00a0 12 of the record).\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 had very serious burns around the mouth and on both buttocks. It is quite certain that the direct cause of the child's death was her inhaling the fire while she was\u00a0 crying, which affected her heart and one of her lungs.\u00a0 If these internal organs\u00a0 had not been affected,\u00a0 it may be\u00a0 that the burns might have been cured.\u00a0 It is fully\u00a0 proven that the child did not fall down out of the house and below it, through a hole in\u00a0 the floor of the same, into the canal, for the reason that there was no such hole and it is\u00a0 impossible that\u00a0 she could have fallen in the manner alleged.\u00a0 If the child had fallen out of the house,\u00a0 she would have landed\u00a0 in front of it and on level ground, and the house was quite low.\u00a0 In my opinion, judging from\u00a0 the\u00a0 extent\u00a0 and seriousness\u00a0 of\u00a0 the burns, as described by Doctor Limkako, it would have been impossible for the child to have burned herself so seriously, had she fallen accidentally.\u00a0 If the child had fallen buttocks first, onto the fire accidentally, she must,\u00a0 in order to cause a bum affecting the entire thickness of the skin\u00a0 and a part of the muscular tissue,\u00a0 necessarily have\u00a0 remained on\u00a0 the fire some time, at least one or two minutes, and the natural instinct\u00a0 of the child\u00a0 would have been\u00a0 to get out of that position\u00a0 and she would not have remained there the\u00a0 length of time\u00a0 necessary to produce such serious\u00a0 burns.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is also difficult to understand how the child could\u00a0 have received the burns only in her mouth and on her buttocks,\u00a0 if she had fallen accidentally.<br\/><br\/>\"It is true, as stated by the counsel for\u00a0 the accused, that the court should take into account the fact that none of\u00a0 the eyewitnesses for the prosecution reported to the\u00a0 authorities what\u00a0 they had\u00a0 seen, nor did anything to rescue the child from the danger.\u00a0 It is somewhat unusual, also, that these two witnesses should have seen, almost at the same moment, the acts performed by the accused; but the woman, Catalina Olaso, was in her own garden, and the man,\u00a0 Pedro Olayres, had entered a coconut grove, and these things could have occurred.\u00a0 The fact\u00a0 that no enmity exists, nor did exist, between these two witnesses and the\u00a0 defendant,\u00a0 tends to establish the veracity of the former's testimony, especially when considered jointly with that of. Doctor Limkako and the justice of the peace, Sr. Mercader.<br\/><br\/>\"The\u00a0 attorney for the defendant argued, with considerable force, that no motive whatever existed on the part of the defendant to induce him to cause the death of this child.<br\/><br\/>\"It is\u00a0 true that the prosecution has not clearly proved the motive that prompted the defendant to commit these acts. Neither\u00a0 does the record disclose\u00a0 any\u00a0 direct\u00a0 and positive evidence whatever that the defendant had any resentment against the child or had threatened her mother.\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking of the motives that the defendant may\u00a0 have had to kill the child, the latter's mother testified (pp. 5 and 6 of the record) that 'apparently, Vicente grumbled at me because he had heard that the child's father was to return;'\u00a0 that witness had desired to separate from the defendant and asked the latter's\u00a0 permission to do so, and that on\u00a0 several\u00a0 occasions she had\u00a0 endeavored to sever her relations\u00a0 with the defendant, but\u00a0 he objected to her carrying out her intention.\u00a0\u00a0 She also testified that the defendant knew that the\u00a0 child was by another\u00a0 man.\u00a0 As I stated, the defendant and the mother of the child\u00a0 were not married, nor were\u00a0 the\u00a0 real parents of the child, and, according to the mother's testimony, the defendant\u00a0 desired to\u00a0 continue\u00a0 his relations with\u00a0 her indefinitely, that is to say, he wished to continue to live with Joaquina, and it is not strange that the defendant, not being the father of the child, might have thought that it was very likely that the father of this little girl loved her very much and might want to return to care for the child and to renew his relations with Joaquina, and, naturally, if the child did not exist, her father's desire to return to Joaquina would not be so strong.\u00a0\u00a0 The child's father has not\u00a0 appeared before this court and we can say nothing about his physical condition or age; but the defendant and Joaquina, among people of their\u00a0 class,\u00a0 might pass for quite good-looking\u00a0 persons. If the child's father had returned to take the little girl away, naturally the mother would have followed the daughter and the father, leaving the defendant alone, and,\u00a0 as the latter very much desired to continue his relations with Joaquina, he committed this very serious crime.<br\/><br\/>\"The qualifying circumstance of <i>alevosia<\/i> enters into th\u00a3 commission of this\u00a0 crime, since the defendant\u00a0 caused the death of\u00a0 the child without any risk whatever to\u00a0 himself; it is also qualified by the circumstance of extreme cruelty, for the reason that, if the desires of the defendant had been only to kill the child, he could have carried out his purpose in some other more expeditious manner, without compelling the victim to undergo such great suffering and for so long a time.\u00a0\u00a0 These two qualifying circumstances raise the crime to the degree of murder, and, as there\u00a0 is no extenuating circumstance whatever and there also exists the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superiority, the penalty\u00a0 must be imposed in its maximum degree.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, I find the defendant, Vicente Oro, guilty of the crime of <i>asesinato<\/i>, as above set forth, and sentence him to be hanged by the neck until dead, in the\u00a0 manner and form required by law.\u00a0\u00a0 I sentence him, furthermore,\u00a0 to pay an indemnity of P500 to the\u00a0 mother of the child, or\u00a0 to her heirs, and to pay the costs of this case.<br\/><br\/>\"This case shall be forwarded to the Supreme Court of these Islands, for such purposes as the law requires.<br\/><br\/>\"So ordered, in Albay, Albay, this 8th day of\u00a0 October, 1909.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Sgd.)\u00a0 \"GRANT TRENT,<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 <i>\"Judge of the Eighth District\"<\/i><\/div><\/blockquote>We concur in the findings of fact set forth in the judgment appealed from.\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence unquestionably shows the defendant's guilt.\u00a0\u00a0 Besides the facts related in the said judgment, the: witness\u00a0 Catalina Olaso positively averred, in one part of her testimony, that she saw the defendant when <i>he was burning the child's mouth.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The findings of law\u00a0 are also correct, with the exception of the one relative to the determination of the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superiority;\u00a0 this circumstance is comprised in that of alevosia, considered in the judgment as qualifying the crime of murder, because, as the Attorney-General well says in his brief, freedom from all danger to the\u00a0 person\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant especially\u00a0 depended\u00a0 on the superior strength of the aggressor and the weakness of the victim, due\u00a0 to\u00a0 her tender\u00a0 age\u00a0 - an\u00a0 absence from\u00a0 danger which is essential for the existence of the circumstance of <i>alevosia<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 said crime being classified by this circumstance, that\u00a0 of\u00a0 extreme cruelty, which the trial\u00a0 court also held to be a qualifying circumstance which without doubt concurred\u00a0 in the perpetration of the crime, should be considered as an aggravating circumstance.\u00a0 The\u00a0 concurrence of such aggravating circumstance, without any extenuating one in the defendant's favor, requires that the penalty provided by law be imposed in its maximum degree, which is that of death.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is affirmed with the costs of this\u00a0 instance against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

that though due demand has been made upon them therefor, defendants refuse\u00a0 to refund to the bank the sums so misappropriated, or any part thereof;\u00a0 that defendants constitute a majority of the present board of directors of the bank, who alone can authorize an action against them in the name of the corporation, and\u00a0 that prior to the filing of the present suit plaintiff\u00a0 exhausted every remedy in\u00a0 the premises within this banking corporation.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 second cause of action\u00a0 sets forth that defendants' and appellees' immediate predecessors in office in this bank during\u00a0 the\u00a0 years 1899, 1900,\u00a0 1901, and 1902, committed the same illegality as to their\u00a0 compensation as is charged against the defendants\u00a0 themselves; that in the four years immediately following the year 1902, the\u00a0 defendants and appellees were the only officials or representatives\u00a0 of\u00a0 the bank who could and should investigate and take action in regard to the sums of money thus fraudulently appropriated by their predecessors;\u00a0 that they were\u00a0 the only persons interested in the bank who knew of the fraudulent appropriation by their predecessors; that they wholly neglected to take any action in\u00a0 the premises or\u00a0 inform the\u00a0 stockholders thereof; that due demand has been made upon defendants to reimburse the bank for this loss; that the bank itself can not bring an action in its own name against the defendants and appellees, for the reason already stated, and that there remains no remedy within the corporation itself.<br\/><br\/>The questions raised in the third cause of action are hot before us at this time as the demurrer to that cause of action was overruled.<br\/><br\/>The court below sustained the demurrer as to the first and second causes of action on the ground that in actions of this character the plaintiff must aver in his complaint that he was the owner of stock in the corporation at the time of the occurrences complained of, or else that the stock\u00a0 has since devolved upon him by operation of law.<br\/><br\/>This action was\u00a0 brought by the plaintiff Pascual, in his own right as a stockholder of the bank, for the benefit of the bank, and all\u00a0 the other stockholders thereof.\u00a0 The plaintiff sues on behalf of the corporation,\u00a0 which, even though nominally\u00a0 a\u00a0 defendant, is to\u00a0 all\u00a0 intents and purposes the\u00a0 real plaintiff in\u00a0 this case.\u00a0 That such is the case is\u00a0 shown by the prayer\u00a0 of the complaint which is that\u00a0 judgment be entered in favor of the bank.<br\/><br\/>According to\u00a0 the pleadings,\u00a0 the Banco Espanol-Filipino is a banking corporation, constituted\u00a0 as such by royal decree of the\u00a0 Crown\u00a0 of Spain in the year 1854, the original grant having been subsequently extended\u00a0 and modified\u00a0 by royal decree of July 14, 1897, and by Actt No. 1790 of the Philippine Commission.\u00a0\u00a0 From the first it has been a bank of issue,\u00a0 and under the Spanish\u00a0 regime was regarded as a quasi-public institution, its full title\u00a0 having been\u00a0 originally \"Banco\u00a0 Espanol-Filipino\u00a0 de\u00a0 Isabel\u00a0 II.\"\u00a0 The\u00a0\u00a0 Captain-General\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Philippine Islands was its protector and supreme head.\u00a0 To him\u00a0 belonged the power to appoint its directors and other managing officers, remove them from office for cause,\u00a0 fix the rate of interest demandable by\u00a0 the bank,\u00a0 resolve\u00a0 all doubts\u00a0 and controversies relating to its management, \"and finally, exercise, as representative of Her Majesty's Government, the powers that the laws give him respecting public establishments protected and privileged.\" it is alleged in the amended complaint that the only compensation contemplated or provided for the managing officers of the bank was a certain per cent of the net profits resulting from the bank's operations, as set\u00a0 forth in article\u00a0 30 of its reformed charter or statutes, which article is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Of the profits or gains\u00a0 which may result from the bank's operations, after deducting all the expenses of its administration\u00a0 and the part,\u00a0 if any, which\u00a0 corresponds to\u00a0 the\u00a0 legal reserve fund, there shall be set apart ten\u00a0 per cent for the directors and\u00a0 five per cent for the board of\u00a0 government,' the distribution\u00a0 of which\u00a0 shall be\u00a0 made as provided in the regulations.\u00a0\u00a0 The eighty-five per cent remaining shall belong integrally to the shareholders pro rata the number\u00a0 of shares owned by each.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Before proceeding to the determination of the real questions involved in this case it might be well to note briefly the origin and history of the right of a stockholder\u00a0 in\u00a0 a corporation to maintain a suit of this kind.<br\/><blockquote>\"A corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation\u00a0 of\u00a0 law.\"\u00a0 (Chief Justice Marshall in Trustees of Dartmouth College <i>vs<\/i>. Woodward, 4 Wheat., 636.)<br\/><br\/>\"The word 'corporation' is but a collective name for the corporators or members who compose an incorporated association ; and where it is said that a\u00a0 corporation is itself\u00a0 a person, or being, or creature, this\u00a0 must be understood\u00a0 in\u00a0 a figurative sense only.\"\u00a0 (Morawetz on Private Corporations, 2d ed., sec. 1.)<br\/><br\/>\"A\u00a0 corporation is 'an\u00a0 artificial\u00a0 person\u00a0 created by\u00a0 the sovereign from natural persons and\u00a0 in which artificial person the natural persons of which it is composed become merged and nonexistent.' \"\u00a0 (Quoted with\u00a0 approval in\u00a0 case of The People, <i>ex. rel<\/i> Winchester, etc., respondent,<i> vs.<\/i> Coleman, et al., commissioners of taxes\u00a0 etc., appellants,\u00a0 133\u00a0 N., Y.

Text writers illustrate this rule by\u00a0 the familiar example of\u00a0 one person or entity owning all the stock and still having no greater or essentially different title than if he owned but one single share.\u00a0 Since, therefore, the\u00a0 stockholder has no title, it is evident that what he does have,\u00a0 with respect to the corporation arid\u00a0 his\u00a0 fellow\u00a0 stockholders, are\u00a0 certain rights\u00a0 sui generis.\u00a0 These rights are generally enumerated as being, first, to have a certificate or other evidence of his status as stockholder issued to him; second, to vote at meetings of the corporation; third, to receive his proportionate share of the profits of the corporation;\u00a0 and lastly, to participate proportionately in the distribution of the corporate assets upon the dissolution or winding up,\u00a0\u00a0 (Purdy's Beach on Private Corporations, sec.\u00a0 554.)<br\/><br\/>The right of individual stockholders to maintain suits for and on behalf of the corporation\u00a0 was denied until\u00a0 within a\u00a0 comparatively short time, but this right is now no longer doubted.\u00a0 Oh this\u00a0 point\u00a0 Cook on Corporations, 5th\u00a0 ed. (1903), sees. 644, 646, and\u00a0 646, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Notwithstanding this fact, however, that\u00a0 it was the duty and right of the corporation to bring suit to remedy these wrongs, it gradually became apparent that\u00a0 frequently the corporation was helpless and\u00a0 unable to\u00a0 institute the suit. It was found, where the guilty parties themselves controlled the directors and also a majority of the stock, that the corporation was in their power,\u00a0 was unable to institute suit, and that the minority of the\u00a0 stockholders were being\u00a0 defrauded of their rights and were without remedy.\u00a0 The time came when the minority of the stockholders of the defrauded corporation - the corporation itself being controlled by the guilty parties - were given a standing in\u00a0 court for the purpose of taking up the cause of the corporation,\u00a0 and, in its name and stead, of bringing the guilty parties to an account. Accordingly, in 1843, in the leading case of Foss <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Harbottle, a stockholder brought suit in the name of himself and other defrauded stockholders, and for the benefit of the corporation, against the directors, for a breach of their duty to the corporation.\u00a0 This case was decided against the complaining stockholder, on the ground that the complainant had not proved that the corporation itself was under the control of the guilty parties, and had not proved that it was unable to institute\u00a0 suit.\u00a0\u00a0 The court, however, broadly\u00a0 intimated that a case <i>might<\/i> arise when a suit instituted by defrauded stockholders would be entertained by the court and redress given.\u00a0 Acting upon this suggestion, and impelled by the utter inadequacy of suits instituted by the corporation, defrauded stockholders continued to institute these\u00a0 suits and to urge the courts of equity to grant relief.\u00a0 These efforts were unsuccessful in clearly establishing the right of stockholders herein until the cases of Atwol against Merriwether, in England, 1867,\u00a0 and of Dodge <i>vs.<\/i> Woolsey, in this country, in 1855.\u00a0 These\u00a0 two great\u00a0 and\u00a0 leading cases\u00a0 have firmly established the law\u00a0 for England and America, that where corporate directors have committed a breach of trust either by their frauds,\u00a0 <i>ultra vires<\/i> acts, or negligence,\u00a0 and the corporation is unable or unwilling to institute suit to remedy the wrong, a\u00a0 single stockholder may institute that suit, suing on behalf of himself and other stockholders and for the benefit of the corporation, to bring about a redress of the wrong done directly to the corporation and indirectly to the stockholders. \"It is now no longer doubted, - said Mr. Justice Wayne, in the case of Dodge <i>vs<\/i>. Woolsey, 18 How. (U. S.), 331 - either in England or the United States, that courts of equity; in both, have a jurisdiction over corporations, at the instance of one or more of their members; to apply preventive remedies by injunction, to\u00a0 restrain those who administer them from doing\u00a0 acts\u00a0 which would\u00a0 amount to a\u00a0 violation\u00a0 of charters, or to prevent any misapplication of their capitals or profits, which might result in lessening the dividends of stockholders, or the value of their shares, as either may be protected by the\u00a0 franchises of a corporation,\u00a0 if the acts intended to be done\u00a0 create what is\u00a0 in the law denominated a breach of trust.\u00a0\u00a0 Ahd the jurisdiction extends to inquire into, and to enjoih, as the case may require that to be done, any proceedings by individuals, in whatever character they\u00a0 may profess to act, if the subject of complaint is an imputed violation of a corporate franchise, or the denial of a right growing out of it, for which there is not an adequate remedy at law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>So it is clear that the plaintiff, by reason of the fact that he is a stockholder in the bank (corporation) has a right to maintain a suit for and on behalf of the bank, but the extent of such a right must depend upon when, how, and for what purpose he acquired the\u00a0 shares which he now owns.\u00a0\u00a0 In the determination of these questions we\u00a0 can not\u00a0 see how, if it be true that the bank is a quasi-public institution, it can affect in any way the final result.<br\/><br\/>It is alleged that the plaintiff became a stockholder on the 13th\u00a0 of November, 1903;\u00a0 that the defendants,\u00a0 as\u00a0 members of the board of directors and\u00a0 board\u00a0 of\u00a0 government, respectively,\u00a0 during each and all the years 1903, 1904,\u00a0 1905, 1906, and 1907, did fraudulently, and to the great prejudice Of the bank and\u00a0 its\u00a0 stockholders, appropriate to their own use from the profits of the bank sums of money amounting approximately to P20,000 per annum.<br\/><br\/>Article 31 of the\u00a0 bank's charter provides that dividends $hall\u00a0 be declared each<i> semestre.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 The stockholders meet once a year, in February, to receive and consider the report of the bank's operations contained in\u00a0 the annual balance and memorial.\u00a0\u00a0 Beyond\u00a0 this they have\u00a0 no\u00a0 direct voice in\u00a0 the affairs of the bank,\u00a0 but all who are then stockholders and have\u00a0 a right to vote must\u00a0 clearly have a\u00a0 right to vote upon\u00a0 all the business proceedings of the year,\u00a0 irrespective of the date upon which they may have become stockholders. They are entitled to all the dividends that\u00a0 have\u00a0 been, earned by their stock during the year which has not been already declared and paid, regardless of the precise period of\u00a0 the year\u00a0 in which it may have\u00a0 accrued.\u00a0\u00a0 So, in\u00a0 the general meeting of the stockholders on February 3,1904, the plaintiff had a right to participate.<br\/><br\/>Neither\u00a0 the charter, the\u00a0 by-laws, nor the\u00a0 regulations prescribe when,\u00a0 within the <i> semestre,<\/i> the dividends shall be declared; but\u00a0 it may be presumed\u00a0 that such dividends are declared at\u00a0 the\u00a0 end of\u00a0 the semestre and that the first <i>semestre <\/i>begins with the first day of January of each year.\u00a0\u00a0 On this basis\u00a0 the\u00a0 owner of stock from whom the plaintiff purchased h?s ten shares might have received the dividends\u00a0 corresponding to\u00a0 these ten shares\u00a0 for\u00a0 the first semestre (six months)\u00a0 of the year 1903.\u00a0 The dividends were declared twice a year, every six months.\u00a0 The times for declaring the dividends are specifically and distinctly pointed out - one period is separated from the other.\u00a0 Every six months forms a\u00a0 period.\u00a0\u00a0 So if the\u00a0 plaintiff was not entitled to the dividends for the first period (from\u00a0 January to July, 1903), he having become a stockholder in September of\u00a0 that year, he would have been entitled to the dividends on his stock for the second period, or semestre.\u00a0 The\u00a0 plaintiff was, therefore, a stockholder during all the time for which he\u00a0 seeks recovery in his first cause of action, except the first six months of the year 1903.\u00a0\u00a0 Then, again, as a matter of fact (which we do not now decide), if the defendants had taken their salaries for\u00a0 the year 1903 at the close of that year or at\u00a0 any time after\u00a0 September\u00a0 13,\u00a0 the plaintiff would then have had\u00a0 an interest and, on the theory that he\u00a0 was a stockholder,\u00a0 could have questioned the legality of the defendants' right to take\u00a0 such salary, inasmuch as his dividends would be directly affected, in that, if the defendants took 10 per cent of the gross instead of the net earnings of the bank,\u00a0 his dividend on his ten shares for the second period\u00a0 (from July to\u00a0 December, 1903) would be less.<br\/><br\/>Conceding that this\u00a0 cause of action is demurrable on the grounds that the\u00a0 plaintiff was not a\u00a0 stockholder during the first six months of the year 1903, should the demurrer have been sustained as to\u00a0 the whole cause of action when the time for which recovery is sought is clearly divisible?<br\/><br\/>Section 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure in\u00a0 force in the Philippine\u00a0 Islands provides, in part, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"2.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 If the complaint contains more than one cause of action, each\u00a0 distinct cause\u00a0 of action must be set\u00a0 forth in a separate paragraph containing all the facts constituting the particular cause of action.<br\/><br\/>\"Where the matter in a single count is divisible in its nature the demurrer should be confined to those parts which are defective, as the same general rule which applies to different counts applies\u00a0 also to divisible matter in the same count constituting different causes of action; and where one count, containing distinct averments,\u00a0 discloses a good cause of action in one of such averments,\u00a0 as\u00a0 when several breaches are assigned, some well\u00a0 and others\u00a0 ill, a general demurrer will be overruled.\"\u00a0 (6 Ency. Plead. &amp; Prac, 303, 304.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The complaint contains three causes of action, each set forth in a\u00a0 separate\u00a0 paragraph.\u00a0 The matter in the first cause is, as we have said, divisible in its nature.\u00a0 The rule above quoted is, therefore, perfectly applicable.<br\/><br\/>The most important question to be decided is, did the lower court err in sustaining the demurrer to the second cause of action?\u00a0 If this question be decided in the negative, then it will not be necessary to determine\u00a0 whether of not the allegations\u00a0 in\u00a0 this part of the complaint\u00a0 are sufficient to hold the defendants liable for the acts of their predecessors.<br\/><br\/>It affirmatively appears\u00a0 from\u00a0 the complaint\u00a0 that\u00a0 the plaintiff was not a stockholder\u00a0 during any of the time in question in this second cause of action.\u00a0 Upon\u00a0 the question whether or not a\u00a0 stockholder can maintain a suit of this li character upon a cause of action pertaining to the corporation\u00a0 when it appears that he was not a\u00a0 stockholder at the time of the occurrence of the acts complained of and upon which the action is based, the authorities do not agree.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Hawes <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Oakland (14 Otto\u00a0 [104 U. S.], 450,\u00a0 456), the plaintiff, a shareholder in the Contra Costa Waterworks Company, brought a bill in\u00a0 equity against the company and the city of Oakland, in the Circuit Court of the United\u00a0 States for California, on the ground\u00a0 that he was a citizen of New York and the defendants citizens of California, alleging that the company was furnishing the city of Oakland with water free of charge beyond what the law required it to do, and that, although he had required them ta desist, the directors had failed to heed\u00a0 his protest and that unless enjoined they would continue to furnish water to the city in excess of their legal obligations in this particular, to the damage of plaintiff and the shareholders.<br\/><br\/>To this complaint the city of Oakland demurred upon the ground that the appellant had shown no capacity in himself to maintain the suit, the injury, if any, being to the corporation, and\u00a0 the right to, sue pertaining to it solely.\u00a0 The demurrer was sustained and the bill dismissed, whereupon the plaintiff carried the case to the Supreme Court of the United States.<br\/><br\/>The decision of the court,\u00a0 which was written by Mr; Justice Miller and concurred in by all the other justices, contains a review of the earlier decisions of the English and American courts\u00a0 with respect to\u00a0 the right\u00a0 of stockholders of corporations to maintain suits of this character.\u00a0 In concluding, the court, after enumerating a number of circumstances in which a stockholder might be permitted to sue upon a cause of action pertaining to the corporation,\u00a0 said:<br\/><blockquote>\"But in addition to the existence of grievances which call for this kind of relief, it is equally\u00a0 important that before the shareholder is permitted,\u00a0 in his own name to institute and conduct a litigation which usually belongs to the corporation he should show to the satisfaction of the\u00a0 court that he has exhausted all the means within his reach to attain within the\u00a0 corporation itself, the redress of\u00a0 his\u00a0 grievances,\u00a0 or action in\u00a0 conformity\u00a0 to\u00a0 his\u00a0 wishes.\u00a0\u00a0 He must make an earnest, not a simulated effort, with the managing body of the\u00a0 corporation, to induce remedial action on their part, and this must be made apparent to the court.\u00a0 If time permits, or has permitted, he must show, if he fails with the directors, that he has\u00a0 made\u00a0 an honest effort to obtain action\u00a0 by the stockholders as a body, in the matter of which he complains. And he must show a case, if this is not done, where it could not be done, or it was not reasonable to require it.<br\/><br\/>\"The efforts to induce such action as plaintiff desires on the part of the directors,\u00a0 or of the stockholders when that is necessary, and the\u00a0 cause of failure in these efforts, and all allegation that plaintiff was a shareholder at the time of the transactions of which he complains, or that the\u00a0 shares have devolved\u00a0 on him since by operation of law and that the suit is not a collusive one to confer on a court, of the United States jurisdiction in a case in which it could otherwise have no cognizance, should be in the bill, which\u00a0 should be verified by affidavit.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This case\u00a0 was decided January 16, 1882.\u00a0 More than a year afterward the Supreme Court embodied the procedural part of this\u00a0 decision in the 94th Equity Rule, adopted January 23, 1883.\u00a0\u00a0 The rule\u00a0 reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every bill\u00a0 brought by one\u00a0 or more stockholders in a corporation\u00a0 against\u00a0 the\u00a0 corporation\u00a0 and\u00a0 other\u00a0 parties, founded on rights which may properly\u00a0 be asserted by the corporation,\u00a0 must be verified by oath, and must contain an allegation that the plaintiff was a shareholder at the time of the transaction of which he complains, or that his shares had devolved on him\u00a0 since by operation of law, and that the suit is not\u00a0 a\u00a0 collusive\u00a0 one to confer on\u00a0 a court of the United States jurisdiction of a case of which it\u00a0 would not otherwise\u00a0 have cognizance.\u00a0 It must also set\u00a0 forth with particularity the\u00a0 efforts of the plaintiff to secure such action as he\u00a0 desires on the part of the managing directors or trustees, and, if necessary, of the shareholders, and the causes of his failure to obtain such action.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>January 21, 1884, the Supreme Court decided the case of Dimpfel\u00a0 <i>vs<\/i>. Ohio, etc., R.\u00a0 R. Co.\u00a0 (110 U. S., 212; 28 Law Ed., 121, 122),\u00a0 which was similar\u00a0 to the Hawes case,\u00a0 above cited.\u00a0 Mr. Justice Field, by whom the opinion of the court was written, says (p. 122):<br\/><blockquote>\"The suit was brought to\u00a0 set aside a contract by which the Ohio and\u00a0 Mississippi Railway\u00a0 Company\u00a0 became the owner of a portion\u00a0 of\u00a0 its road known as the Springfield Division, and to obtain a decree from the court\u00a0 declaring that the bonds, issued by the company and secured\u00a0 by a mortgage upon that division, are null and void.\u00a0 It was commenced\u00a0 by Dimpfel, an individual stockholder in the company, who stated in his bill, that it was filed on behalf of himself and such other stockholders as might join him in the suit.\u00a0 Callaghan, another stockholder, is the only one who joined\u00a0 him.\u00a0\u00a0 The two claim to be owners of fifteen hundred shares of the stock\u00a0 of the company.\u00a0 The whole number of shares\u00a0 is 240,000.\u00a0 The owners of the balance of this large number make no complaint of the transactions which\u00a0 the complainants\u00a0 seek to annul.\u00a0 And it\u00a0 does not appear that the complainant owned their shares when these transactions took place.\u00a0\u00a0 For aught we can see to the contrary, they may have purchased the shares\u00a0 long afterwards, expressly to annoy and vex the company,\u00a0 in the hope that they might thereby extort, from its fears,\u00a0 a larger benefit than the other\u00a0 stockholders have received\u00a0 or may reasonably expect from the purchase, or compel the company to buy their shares at prices above the market value.\u00a0 Unfortunately, litigation against large companies is\u00a0 often instituted by individual stockholders from no higher motive.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The bill in this case was also open to the objection\u00a0 that the plaintiff had not exhausted the means of redress available within the corporation.\u00a0 The court next proceeds\u00a0 to consider this point, but prefaces its remarks with the following significant phrase:<br\/><blockquote>\"But assuming that the complainants were the owners of the shares held by them when the transactions\u00a0 of Which they complain took\u00a0 place, it does not appear that they made any attempt, etc.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Counsel for the plaintiff, in a\u00a0 very able and exhaustive brief sought\u00a0 to show that the doctrine\u00a0 laid down\u00a0 in these two cases is not applicable to the case at bar, first, because the Supreme Court in these cases merely; established a rule of practice, designed to prevent collusive suits in the Federal courts; and, second, that if such rule is to be regarded as a declaration of substantive law, it is wrong on principle and should be disregarded.\u00a0 Many of the authorities cited by the plaintiff to the effect that the rule is merely one of practice, peculiar to the Federal courts, base that conclusion upon the fact that the requirement of the inclusion of the averments in question in the bill is to be found in the :94th Equity Rule. Some of the\u00a0 authorities\u00a0 cited,\u00a0 which hold this\u00a0 view, are: Pomeroy, Eq.

Rep., 229.<br\/><br\/>In the first place the doctrine was announced in Hawes <i>vs.<\/i> Oakland,<i> supra,<\/i> more than a year before the 94th Equity Rule was promulgated, so that it can admit of no dispute that in the opinion of the Supreme Court, at least, the ownership of stock\u00a0 at the time of the transaction complained of was essential\u00a0 to the right to maintain\u00a0 such an action as a matter of substantive law, prior to and independent\u00a0 of the Equity Rule.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 true that the\u00a0 court in writing the decision\u00a0 in the Hawes case, had in mind the prevalence of the practice of bringing suits in the\u00a0 Federal courts, by collusion between the parties, which should properly be tried in the State court. It is equally true that the court\u00a0 was desirous of\u00a0 preventing a continuance of these fraudulent\u00a0 practices, by\u00a0 establishing a test which should prevent them.\u00a0 The basis\u00a0 of the right to sue in the Federal courts being diversity of citizenship, the usual method employed to enable parties to suits of this kind to invoke the jurisdiction of these courts was to have a few shares\u00a0 of\u00a0 stock transferred to some person who was a citizen of a State\u00a0 other than that of which the proposed defendants were citizens.\u00a0 In a case of this kind the transfer of the stock would be, of\u00a0 necessity, merely nominal, and the plaintiff, under such circumstances,\u00a0 would not be a <i>bona fide<\/i> stockholder, and would not be entitled to maintain the suit.\u00a0\u00a0 Of\u00a0 necessity, in cases of this kind, of genuine collusion to create a fictitious diversity of citizenship the nominal transfer of the stock is made at a date sequent to that of the occurrence of the acts or omissions complained of.\u00a0 Although the court was lawfully entitled to protect itself against such frauds as those of which it complains in this case, and to refuse to take cognizance of cases, in which, owing to the purely fictitious nature of the simulated diversity of citizenship, the proper tribunals were the State courts, on the\u00a0 other hand, in cases of genuine diversity\u00a0 of citizenship, it could not lawfully refuse to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it.\u00a0\u00a0 No citation of authority is needed to support the proposition that it is the duty of courts to\u00a0 exercise the jurisdiction properly conferred upon them.\u00a0 It is elementary that where there is a higher tribunal authorized to issue the writ, mandamus will lie to put the judicial machinery\u00a0 in motion.\u00a0 (Spelling,\u00a0 Extraordinary Relief, sec.\u00a0 1394.)\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 being the case, the conclusion\u00a0 is obvious that the mere fact that in some cases persons suing as stockholders for the redress of grievances anterior to the transfer\u00a0 of the stock held by\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 are not\u00a0 acting in good faith would not justify or authorize\u00a0 a refusal to take jurisdiction\u00a0 in\u00a0 any case in which the plaintiff's stock was acquired after the occurrence of the facts supposed to constitute the cause of action, unless the court were of the opinion, as\u00a0 a matter of substantive\u00a0 law, that in no event would a stockholder\u00a0 so situated be entitled to maintain such an action.<br\/><br\/>It is only upon this assumption that the correctness of the decision in Hawes <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Oakland and the legality of the 94th Equity Rule can be maintained.\u00a0 The court had no authority to change the substantive\u00a0 law either by its decision\u00a0 or the rule, and\u00a0 it is not to be presumed that it intended to do so. A careful examination of\u00a0 the Hawes case and of the\u00a0 rule will show that no\u00a0 such change was in fact\u00a0 made.\u00a0 The decision is merely declaratory of the preexisting law, as the court understood it\u00a0 to be, and the rule merely provides a rule of pleading.<br\/><br\/>The decision\u00a0 in the Hawes case is that among other necessary averments, the bill should contain\u00a0 \"an allegation\u00a0 that\u00a0 the plaintiff was a shareholder at the time of\u00a0 the transaction of which he complains\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 and that the suit is not a collusive one to confer jurisdiction on a court of the United States in a case in which it would\u00a0 otherwise have no cognizance\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The language of the 94th Equity Rule is practically identical\u00a0 with this.\u00a0\u00a0 It provides, in terms, that a stockholder's\u00a0 bill in cases\u00a0 of this character\u00a0 \"must contain an allegation that the plaintiff was a\u00a0 stockholder at the time of the transaction of which he complains\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 * and that\u00a0 the suit is not a collusive one to confer jurisdiction *\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* *.\"<br\/><br\/>This is, obviously, a mere rule of pleading - it requires averments of facts upon which the plaintiff's cause of action and the jurisdiction of the court rest.\u00a0 It assumes, as the court had already decided,\u00a0 that the ownership of the stock at the time of the transaction is a fact essential to the maintenance of\u00a0 the suit in\u00a0 any event.\u00a0\u00a0 Unless that fact exists no cause of action exists, whether the suit is collusive or not. Even if the stock\u00a0 was owned prior to the transaction complained of,\u00a0 if the\u00a0 suit is collusive - as.it\u00a0 would be, for instance,\u00a0 if one of the\u00a0 defendants had acquired a\u00a0 merely colorable\u00a0 domicile\u00a0 in another State to support the allegation of diversity of citizenship\u00a0 - the plaintiff has\u00a0 no right to maintain\u00a0 the action in\u00a0 a Federal court.\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently; the rule requires that these two facts be distinctly averted.\u00a0 The requirement that\u00a0 they\u00a0 be pleaded is procedural;\u00a0 The necessity of the existence of the facts in order to give\" rise to the right\u00a0 of action is substantive.<br\/><br\/>If the\u00a0 Supreme Court had been of the opinion,\u00a0 as\u00a0 are some of the State\u00a0 courts and text writers cited in plaintiff's brief, that the transferee of shares of stock in a corporation acquires the right to sue upon causes of action which accrued before he acquired such\u00a0 shares, it surely would not have attempted to\u00a0 deprive him of the\u00a0 right to exercise in\u00a0 the Federal courts an action which, were\u00a0 it\u00a0 not for diversity of citizenship, he\u00a0 might exercise in\u00a0 a\u00a0 State court.\u00a0 If\u00a0 the court had believed that\u00a0 the transferee of stock could, under any circumstances, sue upon a cause of action accruing to the corporation prior to such transfer, the rule\u00a0 instead of requiring the plaintiff to allege unconditionally that he was a stockholder at the time of the transaction complained of and that the suit is not collusive, would have provided that the plaintiff should be required to aver\u00a0 in\u00a0 his sworn bill the date upon which he acquired his stock, and if it appeared that it was.acquired\u00a0 after the occurrence of the acts\u00a0 complained of, then that he should also be required to aver under oath that the suit was not collusive.<br\/><blockquote>\"Sound reason and good authority sustain the rule that a purchaser of stock can not complain of the prior acts and management of the corporation.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Home Fire Ins.

Co. <i>vs. <\/i>Baker, <i>supra<\/i>,\u00a0 and cases cited\u00a0 therein.)\u00a0 Some of the State courts hold that a purchaser of shares\u00a0 in a corporation acquires all the rights of the vendor.\u00a0 The\u00a0 Alabama Supreme Court has\u00a0 gone so far\u00a0 as to hold that a purchaser in good faith is not necessarily disqualified as a suitor in all cases because the prior holder was personally disqualified. (Parsons<i> vs. <\/i>Joseph, 92 Ala., 403.)\u00a0\u00a0 From the pleadings in this case (it having been decided by the Supreme Court upon a\u00a0 demurrer)\u00a0 it appears that Joseph\u00a0 sought\u00a0 to have\u00a0 canceled\u00a0 certain\u00a0 certificates of stock issued\u00a0 by\u00a0 the Street Railway Company to Parsons, on the ground that said stock was fictitious and was issued in violation of the constitution and statute law of the State.\u00a0 It was alleged, as a special defense, that if the transactions, which form the basis of the issuance of the stock to Parsons, were illegal, and fraudulent, and not done in good faith, thje complainant, Joseph,\u00a0 was estopped from setting up fraud in such transactions, or seeking to cancel the\u00a0 stock, because one E. Lesser, who\u00a0 was complainant's transferred participated in all of said transactions.\u00a0 In this case the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Coleman, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"If the transferee purchased the shares in good faith, and without notice of the fact that the prior holder had precluded himself from\u00a0 suing, he would have as just\u00a0 a\u00a0 title to relief as if he had purchased from a shareholder who was under no disability;\u00a0 but if\u00a0 the purchaser\u00a0 was aware that the prior holder had barred his right to\u00a0 relief, neither\u00a0 justice nor public policy would require that the transferee, under these cicumstances, should\u00a0 be accorded any greater rights\u00a0 than his transferrer.<br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"If a stockholder participates in a wrongful or fraudulent contract, or silently\u00a0 acquiesces until the contract becomes executed, he can\u00a0 not then come into a court of equity\u00a0 to cancel the\u00a0 contract,\u00a0 and more especially if\u00a0 the company, or himself, as\u00a0 a stockholder, has reaped a benefit from the contract; and this rule holds good, although the consideration of the contract may be one expressly prohibited by statute. The same disability .would attach to the transferee\u00a0 of his stock who bought with notice.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This rule, in the main,\u00a0 is correctly stated, but we think that the latter\u00a0 part of the same should be modified so as\u00a0 to read: \"The same disability would attach to the transferee\u00a0 of his stock who\u00a0 bought with or without notice.\"\u00a0 We base our modification of this rule upon the ground that a\u00a0 transferee could not sue as being a bona fide purchaser in\u00a0 ignorance of the disability attaching to his vendor, because\u00a0 shares of stock, strictly speaking,\u00a0 are not negotiable, and the\u00a0 sale can not\u00a0 pass greater rights than\u00a0 those possessed, by the vendor.\u00a0\u00a0 (Clark <i>vs,<\/i>\u00a0 American Coal Co., 86\u00a0 Iowa, 436;\u00a0 4 Thomp. Corp.,\u00a0 8410.)<br\/><br\/>It is self-evident that the plaintiff in the case at bar was not, before he acquired in September, 1903, the shares\u00a0 which he now owns,\u00a0 injured or\u00a0 affected\u00a0 in any manner by the transactions set forth in the second cause of\u00a0 action.\u00a0 His vendor could have complained of these\u00a0 transactions, but he did not choose\u00a0 to\u00a0 do so.\u00a0\u00a0 The discretion whether to sue to set them aside, or to\u00a0 acquiesce in and agree to them, is, in our opinion, incapable of transfer.\u00a0\u00a0 If the plaintiff himself had been injured\u00a0 by the\u00a0 acts\u00a0 of defendants' predecessors that is another matter.\u00a0 He ought to take things as he\u00a0 found them\u00a0 when Ke\u00a0 voluntarily acquired his ten shares.\u00a0 If he was defrauded in the purchase of\u00a0 these shares he should sue his vendor.\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><blockquote>\"If the party himself,\u00a0 who is the victim of fraud or usury, chooses\u00a0 to waive his remedy and release the party,. it does not belong to a subsequent purchaser under him to recall and assume the remedy for him.\u00a0 (Quoted with\u00a0 approval in the case of Graham <i>vs<\/i>. La Crosse and Milwaukee R. R. Co., 102 U.S., 148.)<br\/><br\/>\"But it is contended that this\u00a0 is a\u00a0 case\u00a0 in which the debtor corporation was defrauded of its property, and that as the company had a right of proceeding for its recovery, any of its judgment and execution creditors have an equal right; that it is a property right, and one that inures to the benefit of creditors.<br\/><br\/>\"Conceding that creditors who were such when the fraudulent procurement\u00a0 of the debtor's\u00a0 property\u00a0 occurred - and cases to\u00a0 that effect have\u00a0 been cited - the\u00a0 question still remains, whether, the debtor being unwilling to disturb the transaction, subsequent creditors have such an interest that they can reach the property for\u00a0 the satisfaction of their debts.\u00a0\u00a0 We doubt whether\u00a0 any case, going as far as\u00a0 this, can be found.\u00a0 No such case has been cited in the argument. Dicta of judges to that effect may undoubtedly be produced, but they are not supported\u00a0 by the facts\u00a0 of the cases under consideration.<br\/><br\/>\"It seems clear that subsequent creditors have no better right than subsequent purchasers, to question a previous transaction in which\u00a0 the debtor's property was\u00a0 obtained from him by fraud, which he has acquiesced in, and which he has manifested no desire\u00a0 to disturb.\u00a0 Yet, in such a case, subsequent purchasers have no such right.\"\u00a0\u00a0 <i>(Id.<\/i>)<\/blockquote>So it seems to be settled by the Supreme\u00a0 Court of the United States, as a matter of substantive law, that a stockholder in a corporation who was not such at the time of the transactions complained of, or whose shares had not devolved upon him since by operation of law, can\u00a0 not maintain suits of this character, unless such transactions\u00a0 continue and are injurious to\u00a0 the stockholder,\u00a0 or affect him especially and specifically in some\u00a0 other way.<br\/><br\/>We are, therefore of the opinion, and so\u00a0 hold, that the judgment appealed from, sustaining the demurrer\u00a0 to the first cause of\u00a0 action\u00a0 should be, and the same is\u00a0 hereby reversed; and the judgment sustaining the demurrer to the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 second cause of action should be,\u00a0 and is\u00a0 hereby affirmed, without any special ruling as to costs.\u00a0 The record will be returned to the court whence it came for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Raymundo, alleging, as\u00a0 a cause of action, that Estanislaua Arenas was the owner and\u00a0 proprietor of the jewelry described below with the respective value thereof:<br\/><br\/><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" width=\"90%\"> <tbody><tr> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"92%\">Two gold <i>tamborin<\/i> rosaries, without bow or reliquary\u00a0\u00a0 at P40 each.............................................<\/td> <td valign=\"top\" width=\"8%\"><div align=\"right\">P80<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">One lady's comb for fastening the hair, made of gold and silver,\u00a0 adorned with pearls of ordinary size and many small pearls,\u00a0 one of which is missing....................................................................................<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"right\"><br\/>80<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">One gold ring set with a diamond of ordinary size.....................................................................................<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"right\">1,000<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">One gold bracelet with five small diamonds and eight <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">brillantitos<\/span>\u00a0 <i>de\u00a0\u00a0 almendras<\/i>.........................................<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"right\">700<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">One pair of gold <i>picaporte<\/i> earrings with two diamonds\u00a0\u00a0 of\u00a0\u00a0 ordinary size and two small ones..........................................................................................<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"right\"><br\/>1,100<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table><br\/>The plaintiffs alleged\u00a0 that the said jewelry, during the last\u00a0 part of April or\u00a0 the beginning of May, 1908, was delivered to Elena de Vega to sell on commission, and that the latter, in turn, delivered it\u00a0 to Concepcion Perello, likewise to sell on commission, but that Perello, instead of fulfilling her trust, pledged the jewelry in the defendant's pawnshop, situated\u00a0 at No. 33 Calle de\u00a0 Ilaya, Tondo, and appropriated to her own use the money thereby obtained; that on July 30, 1908, Goncepcion Per.elio was prosecuted for estafa,\u00a0 convicted, and the judgment became final; that the said jewelry was\u00a0 then under the control and in the possession of the defendant, as a result of the pledge by Perello, and that the former refused to\u00a0 deliver it to the plaintiffs, the owners thereof,\u00a0 wherefore\u00a0 counsel\u00a0 for the\u00a0 plaintiffs asked that judgment be rendered sentencing\u00a0 the defendant to make restitution of the said jewelry and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 the affidavit presented by the attorney for the\u00a0 plaintiffs,\u00a0 dated\u00a0 September 2, 1908, after a\u00a0 statement and description of the jewelry mentioned, it is set forth that the defendant was retaining it for the reason given in the complaint, and that it was not sequestrated for the\u00a0 purpose of satisfying any tax or fine or by reason of any attachment issued in compliance with any judgment\u00a0 rendered against the plaintiffs' property.<br\/><br\/>In discharge of the\u00a0 writ\u00a0 of seizure issued for the\u00a0 said jewelry on the 2d of September, 1908, aforementioned, the sheriff of this city made the return that he had, on the same date,\u00a0 delivered\u00a0 one copy of the bond and another\u00a0 of\u00a0 the said writ to the defendant personally and, on the petition and designation of the attorney for the plaintiffs, proceeded to seize the jewelry described in the writ, taking it out of the defendant's control, and held it in his possession\u00a0 during the five days prescribed by law.<br\/><br\/>On the 15th of the same month and year, five days having elapsed\u00a0 without the defendant's having given bond\u00a0 before the court, the sheriff made delivery\u00a0 of all the jewelry\u00a0 described in the said\u00a0 order to the attorney\u00a0 for the plaintiff, to the latter's entire satisfaction, who with the sheriff signed the return of the writ.<br\/><br\/>After the demurrer to the complaint had been overruled, the defendant answered, setting forth that he denied each and all of the allegations thereof which were not specifically admitted, explained, or qualified,\u00a0 and as a special defense alleged that the jewelry, the subject ^matter of the complaint, was pledged in his pawnshop\u00a0 by\u00a0 Concepcion Perello, the widow of Pazos, as\u00a0 security for a\u00a0 loan of P1,524, with the knowledge,\u00a0 consent, and mediation of Gabriel La O, a son of the plaintiffs, as their\u00a0 agent, and that, in consequence thereof, the said plaintiffs were estopped from disavowing the action of the said Perello; the defendant therefore prayed that the complaint be dismissed and that the jewelry seized at the instance of the plaintiffs, or the amount of the loan made thereon, together with the interest due, be returned to the defendant, with the costs\u00a0 of\u00a0 the suit against\u00a0 the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>The case\u00a0 came up for hearing on\u00a0 March 17, 1909, and, after the presentation of oral testimony by\u00a0 both parties, the court, on June 23 of the same year, rendered judgment sentencing the defendant to restore to the plaintiff spouses the jewelry described in the complaint, the right being reserved to the defendant to institute his action against the proper party.\u00a0 The counsel for the defendant excepted to this judgment, asked that the same\u00a0 be set aside, and a new trial granted.\u00a0 This motion was denied, exception was taken by the appellant, and the proper bill of exceptions was duly approved, certified to, and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>This is an action for the replevin of certain\u00a0 jewelry delivered by its owner for sale on commission, and\u00a0 pledged without his knowledge by\u00a0 Concepcion\u00a0 Perello in the pawnshop of the defendant,\u00a0 Fausto 0. Raymundo, who refuses to deliver the said jewelry unless first redeemed.<br\/><br\/>The said Coneepcion Perello, who\u00a0 appropriated to herself the money derived from the pledging\u00a0 of the jewels before mentioned, together with others, to the prejudice of their owner Estanislaua Arenas,\u00a0 was prosecuted in, the Court of First Instance of this city in cause No. 3955 and sentenced on July 30, 1908,\u00a0 to the penalty of\u00a0 one year eight\u00a0 months and twienty-one days of <i>prision\u00a0 correccional<\/i>,\u00a0 to\u00a0 restore to the offended party the jewelry specified in the complaint, or to pay the value thereof, amounting to P8,660, or, in case of insolvency, to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs.\u00a0 This judgment is attested by the certified copy attached under letter D to folio 26 of the record of the proceedings in the case of the same plaintiff against Antonio Matute - the pledgee of the other jewelry also appropriated by the said Concepcion Perello -\u00a0 which record\u00a0 forms a part of the evidence in this cause.<br\/><br\/>Perello having pledged the jewelry\u00a0 in question\u00a0 to the defendant Raymundo, and not having redeemed it by paying him\u00a0 the amount received, it follows\u00a0 that the convicted\u00a0 woman, now serving the sentence imposed upon her, could not restore the jewelry as ordered in that judgment, which has become final by the defendant's acquiescence.<br\/><br\/>Article 120 of the Penal Code prescribes:<br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 restitution\u00a0 of the thing itself must be made,\u00a0 if possible, with\u00a0 payment for deterioration or\u00a0 diminution\u00a0 of value, to be appraised by the court.<br\/><br\/>\"Restitution shall be made, even though the\u00a0 thing may be in the possession of a third person, who had acquired it in a legal manner, reserving, however, his action against the proper person.<br\/><br\/>\"This provision is not applicable to a case in which the third\u00a0 person has acquired the thing\u00a0 in the manner\u00a0 and with the requisites established by law to make it\u00a0 unrecoverable.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The provisions contained in the first two paragraphs\u00a0 of the preinserted article are based\u00a0 on the uncontrovertible principle of justice that the party injured through a crime has, as against all others, a preferential right to be indemnified, or to have restored to him the thing of which he\u00a0 was unduly deprived by criminal means.<br\/><br\/>In view of the harmonious relation between the different qodes in force in these Islands, it is natural and logical that the aforementioned\u00a0 provision of the Penal Code, based on the rule established in article 17 of the same, to wit, that every person criminally liable for a crime or misdemeanor is also civilly liable,\u00a0 should be in agreement and accordance with the provisions\u00a0 of article 464 of the Civil Code which prescribes:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><blockquote>\"The possession of\u00a0 personal property, acquired in good faith, is equivalent to a title thereto.\u00a0\u00a0 However, the person who has lost personal property or has been illegally deprived thereof may recover it from whoever possesses it.<br\/><br\/>\"If the possessor of\u00a0 personal property, lost\u00a0 or stolen,\u00a0 has acquired it in good faith at a public sale, the owner can not recover it without reimbursing the price paid therefor.<br\/><br\/>\"Neither can the owner of things pledged in pawnshops, established with\u00a0 the authorization of\u00a0 the Government, recover them, whosoever\u00a0 may be the person who pledged them, without previously refunding to the institution the amount of the pledge and the\u00a0 interest\u00a0 due.<br\/><br\/>\"With regard to things acquired on exchange, or at fairs or markets\u00a0 or from\u00a0 a merchant legally established\u00a0 and usually employed in similar dealings, the provisions of the Code of Commerce shall be observed.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On\u00a0 January 2,\u00a0 1908, this court had occasion\u00a0 to decide, among other cases, two which were entirely analogous to the present one.\u00a0 They were No. 3889, Varela vs. Matute, and No. 3890, Varela <i>vs<\/i>. Finnick (9 Phil. Rep., 479, 482).<br\/><br\/>In the decisions in both cases\u00a0 it appears that Nicolasa Pascual\u00a0 received various jewels from Josef a Varela to sell on commission and that, instead\u00a0 of\u00a0 fulfilling\u00a0 the trust or returning the jewels to their owner, she\u00a0 pledged some of them in the pawnshop of Antonio Matute and others in that of H.\u00a0 J. Finnick and\u00a0 appropriated to herself\u00a0 the amounts that she received,\u00a0 to\u00a0 the detriment\u00a0 of the owner of\u00a0 the jewelry.<br\/><br\/>Tried for <i>estafa<\/i>\u00a0 in cause No. 2429, the said\u00a0 Pascual was convicted and\u00a0 sentenced\u00a0 to the penalty\u00a0 of one\u00a0 year and eleven months of prisidn correctional, to restore to Varela. tjie jewelry appropriated, or to pay the value thereof, and, in case of insolvency, to subsidiary imprisonment; this judgment became final,\u00a0 whereupon the\u00a0 defendant began to serve her sentence.\u00a0 The case just cited is identical to\u00a0 that\u00a0 of Concepcion Perello.<br\/><br\/>Josef a Varela, in\u00a0 separate\u00a0 incidental\u00a0 proceedings,\u00a0 demanded the restitution or delivery of\u00a0 possession of the said jewelry; the pledgees,\u00a0 the pawnbrokers, refused to comply with her demand, alleging, among other reasons,\u00a0 that they were entitled to possession.\u00a0 The two\u00a0 cases were duly tried, and the Court\u00a0 of First\u00a0 Instance pronounced judgment, supporting the\u00a0 plaintiff's claims in each.\u00a0 Both cases were appealed by the defendants, Matute and Finnick, and this court affirmed the\u00a0 judgments on\u00a0 the same grounds, with costs, and the decisions on appeal established the following legal doctrines:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. <i>Crimes against property; criminal and civil liability<\/i>. - Where, in a proceeding instituted by reason of a crime committed against property, the criminal liability of the accused has been declared, it follows that he shall also be held civilly liable therefor, because\u00a0 every person\u00a0 who is\u00a0 criminally responsible on account of a crime or misdemeanor is also civilly liable.<br\/><br\/>\"2. <i>Id.; Recovery of property unlawfully in possession<\/i>. - Whoever may have been deprived of his\u00a0 property in\u00a0 consequence of a crime is entitled to the recovery thereof, even if such property is in the possession of a third party\u00a0 who acquired it by legal means other than those expressly stated in article 464 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>\"3.<i> Personal property; title by possession<\/i>. - In order that the possession of personal property may be considered as a title thereto it is indispensable that the same shall have been\u00a0 acquired in good faith.<br\/><br\/>\"4. <i>Id.; Ownership; prescription<\/i>. - The ownership of\u00a0 personal property prescribes in the manner and within the time fixed by articles 1955 and 1962, in connection with article 464, of the Civil Code.\"<\/blockquote>In\u00a0 the cause prosecuted against Perello, as also in the present\u00a0 suit,\u00a0 it was\u00a0 not\u00a0 proven that Estanislaua Arenas authorized the former to\u00a0 pawn the\u00a0 jewelry given\u00a0 to her by Arenas to sell on commission.\u00a0 Because of the mere\u00a0 fact of Perello's having been convicted and sentenced for estafa, and for\u00a0 the very reason that she is now serving her sentence, the rest of the dispositive part of the said sentence must be complied with, that is, the jewelry misappropriated must be restored to its owner, inasmuch as it exists and has not disappeared this restitution must be made, although the jewelry is found in the pawnshop of Fausto 0, Raymundo and the latter had acquired it by legal means.\u00a0\u00a0 Raymundo however retains his right\u00a0 to collect the amounts delivered upon\u00a0 the pledge, by bringing\u00a0 action against the proper party.\u00a0 This finding is in\u00a0 accord with the provisions of the above article 120 of the Penal Code and the first paragraph of article 464\u00a0 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>The aforementioned decision, No. 3890, Varela vs. Finnick, recites, among other considerations, the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"The exception contained in paragraph 3 of said article is not applicable to the present case because a pawnshop does not\u00a0 enjoy the\u00a0 privilege established by\u00a0 article 464\u00a0 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 The owner of the loan office of Finnick Brothers, notwithstanding the fact that he acted in good faith, did not acquire the jewels at a public sale; it is not a question of\u00a0 public\u00a0 property, securities, or\u00a0 other such effects, the transfer,\u00a0 sale, or disposal of which is\u00a0 subject to.the provisions of the Code of Commerce.\u00a0 Neither does a pawnshop enjoy the privilege granted to a monte\u00a0 de piedad; therefore, Josefa Varela, who lost said jewels and was deprived of the same in consequence of a crime, is entitled to the recovery thereof from the pawnshop of\u00a0 Finnick Brothers,\u00a0 where they were pledged; the latter can not lawfully refuge to comply with the provisions\u00a0 of article 120 of\u00a0 the Penal Code, as it is a question of jewels which have been misappropriated by the commission of the crime of estafa, and the execution of the sentence\u00a0 which orders the restitution of the\u00a0 jewels can not be avoided because of the good faith with\u00a0 which the owner of the pawnshop acquired them, inasmuch as they were delivered to the accused, who was\u00a0 not the owner nor authorized to dispose of the same.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Even supposing that the defendant Raymundo had acted in good faith in accepting the pledge of the jewelry in litigation, even\u00a0 then he would not be entitled to retain it\u00a0 until the owner thereof reimburse him for the amount loaned to the embezzler, since the said owner of the jewelry, the plaintiff, did not make any contract with the pledgee, that would obligate him to pay the amount loaned to Perello, and the trial record does not\u00a0 disclose any evidence,\u00a0 even circumstantial, that the plaintiff Arenas consented to\u00a0 or had knowledge of the pledging of her jewelry in the pawnshop of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>For this reason, and because Concepcion Perello was not the legitimate owner of the jewelry which she pledged\u00a0 to the defendant Raymundo, for a certain sum that she received from the latter\u00a0 as a loan, the contract\u00a0 of pledge entered into by both\u00a0 is,\u00a0 of course, null and void, and, consequently the jewelry so pawned can not\u00a0 serve as security for the payment of the sum loaned, nor can the latter be collected out of the value of the said jewelry.<br\/><br\/>Article 1857 of the Civil Code prescribes as one of the essential requisites of the contracts of pledge and of mortgage, that the thing pledged or mortgaged must\u00a0 belong to the person who pledges or mortgages it.\u00a0 This essential requisite for the contract of pledge between Perello and the defendant being absent as the former was not the owner of the jewelry given\u00a0 in pledge, the contract is as devoid of value and force as if it had not been made, and as it was executed with marked violation of an express provision of the law, it\u00a0 can not confer upon\u00a0 the defendant any rights in the pledged jewelry, nor impose any obligation toward him on the part of the owner thereof, since the latter was deprived of her possession by means of the illegal pledging of the said jewelry, a criminal\u00a0 act.<br\/><br\/>Between the supposed good faith of the defendant\u00a0 Raymundo and the undisputed good faith of the plaintiff Arenas, the owner of the jewelry, neither law nor justice permit that the latter, after being the victim of embezzlement, should have to choose one of the two extremes of a dilemma, both of which, without legal ground or reason,\u00a0 are injurious and prejudicial to her interests and rights,\u00a0 that is,\u00a0 she\u00a0 must either lose her jewelry or pay a large sum received by the embezzler as\u00a0 a loan from the defendant,\u00a0 when the plaintiff Arenas is\u00a0 not related to the latter by any legal or contractual bond out\u00a0 of which legal obligations arise.<br\/><br\/>Is it true that the plaintiffs' son, attorney Gabriel La 0, intervened and gave his consent when Concepcion Perello pawned\u00a0 the jewelry in litigation\u00a0 with Fausto Raymundo for P1,524?\u00a0 In view of the evidence offered by the trial record, the answer is, of course, in the negative.<br\/><br\/>The parents of the attorney Gabriel La 0 being\u00a0 surprised by\u00a0 the disagreeable news of the disappearance of various jewels, amounting in value to more than P8,600,\u00a0 delivered to Elena Vega for sale on commission and misappropriated by\u00a0 Concepcion Perello, who received them from\u00a0 Vega for the same purpose, it is natural that the said attorney, acting in representation of his parents and as an interested party, should\u00a0 have (proceeded\u00a0 to\u00a0 ascertain\u00a0 the whereabouts of the embezzled jewelry and to enter into negotiations with the pawnshop\u00a0 of Fausto 0. Raymundo, in whose possession he had finally learned were to be found a part of the embezzled\u00a0 jewels, as he\u00a0 had been informed\u00a0 by the\u00a0 said Perello herself; and\u00a0 although, at first, at the commencement of his investigations, he met with opposition on the part\u00a0 of the pledgee Raymundo, who\u00a0 objected to showing him the jewels that he desired to see in order to ascertain whether they were those embezzled\u00a0 and\u00a0 belonging to his mother, the plaintiff Arenas,\u00a0 thanks to\u00a0 the\u00a0 intervention of attorney Chicote and to the fact that they\u00a0 succeeded in obtaining\u00a0 from the embezzler, among other papers, the pawn\u00a0 ticket issued\u00a0 by Raymundo's pawnshop, Exhibit E, of the date of May 4, 1908, folio 19 of the record in the case against Matute, Gabriel La 0 succeeded in getting the defendant\u00a0 to show him the jewelry described in the said ticket together with\u00a0 other jewels that did not belong to La O's mother, that had been given the defendant by Ambrosia Capistrano,\u00a0 Perello's\u00a0 agent, in pledge or security for a\u00a0 loan of P170.<br\/><br\/>Gabriel La 0, continuing the search for the other missing jewelry\u00a0 belonging\u00a0 to\u00a0 his mother,\u00a0 found that Pausto O. Raymundo was in possession of it and had received it from the same embezzler as security for a debt, although the defendant Raymundo would not exhibit it until he issued the pawn tickets corresponding to such jewels; therefore, at Raymundo's request, Perello, by means of the document Exhibit\u00a0 C, signed by herself and bearing date\u00a0 of\u00a0 June 10, 1908,\u00a0 folio 28\u00a0 of the\u00a0 record, authorized\u00a0 her\u00a0 son Ramon to get from the defendant, in her name, the pawn tickets of the said other jewelry, for which\u00a0 such tickets had\u00a0 not yet been issued; Raymundo then wrote out the\u00a0 tickets - Exhibits L, LL, and M, all dated June\u00a0 22, 1908, and found on folios 20, 21, and 22 of the record\u00a0 of the aforesaid proceedings against Matute - in the presence\u00a0 of the attorney Gabriel La 0, who kept the said three pawn tickets, after he had made sure that the jewels\u00a0 described therein\u00a0 and which Raymundo, taking them out of his cabinet, exhibited to him at the time, were among those embezzled from his mother.<br\/><br\/>So that,\u00a0 when\u00a0 the three aforementioned pawn tickets, Exhibits L, LL, and M, from the pawnshop of the defendant, were made out,\u00a0 the latter already, and for some time previous, had had\u00a0 in his possession as a pledge the jewelry described in them, and the plaintiffs'\u00a0 son, naturally desiring to recover\u00a0 his parents' jewelry,\u00a0 was satisfied for the time being with keeping the three pawn\u00a0 tickets certifying that such jewelry was pawned to the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, the record discloses no proof that the attorney Gabriel La O consented to or took any part in the delivery of the jewelry in question to the\u00a0 defendant as a\u00a0 pledge, and both the said\u00a0 defendant,\u00a0 Raymundo, and the embezzler Perello, averred in their respective testimony that the said attorney La O had no knowledge\u00a0 of and took\u00a0 no\u00a0 part in the pledging of the jewelry, and\u00a0 Perello further stated that she had received all the money loaned to her by the defendant Raymundo.\u00a0 (Folios 13 to 14, and 76 to 80\u00a0 of the record in the case against Matute.)<br\/><br\/>The business of pawnshops, in\u00a0 exchange for the high and onerous\u00a0 interest which\u00a0 constitutes\u00a0 its enormous\u00a0 profits, is always exposed to the contingency of receiving in pledge or security for the loans, jewels and other articles that have been robbed, stolen, or embezzled from their legitimate owners;\u00a0 and as the owner of the pawnshop accepts\u00a0 the pledging of jewelry from the first bearer\u00a0 who\u00a0 offers\u00a0 the same and asks for money on it, without assuring himself whether such bearer is or is not the\u00a0 owner\u00a0 thereof, he can not, by such procedure, expect\u00a0 from the law\u00a0 better and more preferential protection than the owner\u00a0 of the jewels or other articles who was deprived thereof by means of a crime and is entitled to be excused by the courts.<br\/><br\/>Antonio Matute, the owner of another pawnshop, being convinced that he was wrong,\u00a0 refrained\u00a0 from appealing from the judgment wherein he was sentenced to return, without redemption, to the plaintiffs, another jewel of great value which had been pledged to him by the same Perello. He undoubtedly had in mind some of the previous decisions of this\u00a0 court, one of which was against himself.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors attributed to the judgment of the Court of First Instance have been discussed and decided upon, and the said\u00a0 judgment being in harmony with the law, the evidence and the merits Qf the case, it is proper, in our opinion, to affirm\u00a0 the same, as we hereby do, with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Isidro Paredes rendered a decision in favor of the plaintiff and\u00a0 against the defendants, jointly and severally, ordering them to pay\u00a0 to the\u00a0 plaintiff the sum of P900, with costs.<\/p><p>From that\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 the defendants appealed to\u00a0 this court and made the following assignments of error:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"I. The lower court erred in holding to be proven the fact that the defendants went upon the plaintiff's land, described in the complaint, in the month of May, 1907; and in holding that it had jurisdiction to try this complaint.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"II. The lower court also erred in holding that the plaintiff's action\u00a0 in this case has not been prescribed.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>With reference to the first\u00a0 assignment of error the defendants and\u00a0 appellants in their brief, filed in this court, make the following statement:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The evidence establishes\u00a0 beyond all doubt the following facts:\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"That in\u00a0 the month of May, 1897, the defendants\u00a0 went upon a piece of land which the plaintiff says is his, and cut down 500 banana plants, 100 'viga' plants, and 50 abaca plants, worth approximately P700.\u00a0 There is no evidence in the\u00a0 record\u00a0 showing where the aforesaid\u00a0 tract of land is situated.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>It will be noted by this admission of the appellants that the\u00a0 defendants had committed the acts alleged in the complaint which resulted in\u00a0 damages to the plaintiff.\u00a0 It will be noted also by the above admission, that the special defense is that\u00a0 the lower court had no jurisdiction, for the reason\u00a0 that there was no proof that the\u00a0 land in question was within the jurisdiction of the court.\u00a0 The action was a personal action for damages done to land.\u00a0 There may be some question as\u00a0 to the\u00a0 requirement that such an action shall be brought in the Court of First Instance within the jurisdiction of which the\u00a0 land is located.\u00a0\u00a0 However, admitting that the action must be brought in the court within the jurisdiction of which the land\u00a0 is located, even then it is asserted that\u00a0 under the complaint which alleges that\u00a0 the land was located in the \"barrio of Ginagdanan, municipality of Argaw,\" that the court could take judicial notice of the fact that the\u00a0 said land was within the jurisdiction of his court.\u00a0\u00a0 The court had a perfect\u00a0 right to take judicial notice of the\u00a0 fact that the municipality of Argaw was within his jurisdiction (sec. 275, Code of Procedure in Civil Actions), in the absence of an allegation that the\u00a0 said barrio was Within the jurisdiction of the court.<\/p><p>With reference to the\u00a0 other\u00a0 error alleged to have been committed\u00a0 by the lower court assigned in the first assignment of error, to wit; That the acts done by the defendants causing\u00a0 damages to the\u00a0 plaintiff were\u00a0 done in the year 1897, the lower court in\u00a0 his decision found that,\u00a0 notwithstanding the fact that the witnesses for the plaintiff stated that said acts\u00a0 causing damages were committed on the 8th of May, 1897,\u00a0 that they intended to say on the 8th of May, 1907.\u00a0 The lower court\u00a0 in his decision gave strong reasons for\u00a0 believing\u00a0 that\u00a0 when\u00a0 some\u00a0 of the witnesses for the plaintiff declared that the\u00a0 acts complained of had been done in 1897, they intended\u00a0 to say 1907,\u00a0 We find no reason, after a full consideration of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, taking into consideration the findings of fact by the lower court, to modify the decision of the lower court in any way, based upon the first assignment of error above quoted.<\/p><p>With reference to the second assignment of error above quoted, to\u00a0 wit: That the cause of action was prescribed, it is sufficient to say in answer to this assignment of error, that\u00a0 the question\u00a0 of prescription was neither raised by demurrer nor answer in the lower court and\u00a0 therefore can not be raised here.\u00a0 The question of prescription can not be raised by demurrer.\u00a0\u00a0 It must be raised by answer.\u00a0 (Domingo <em>vs.<\/em>\u00a0 Osorio, 7 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 405.)\u00a0\u00a0 However, even\u00a0 admitting that the\u00a0 defense of prescription had\u00a0 been made in the lower\u00a0 court it could not be maintained for the reason that\u00a0 the present cause is a personal action\u00a0 and does\u00a0 not prescribe until the lapse of fifteen years.\u00a0 (Art.\u00a0 1964, Civil Code.)\u00a0\u00a0 The action would not have been\u00a0 prescribed even admitting that the damages were committed in 1897 instead of 1907.<\/p><p>We find no reason for modifying the judgment of\u00a0 the lower court; therefore the same is hereby affirmed.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ<\/em>.,\u00a0 concur.<\/p><\/div>",

It appears, but the fact\u00a0 is not clearly shown in the record, that Andres died without leaving\u00a0 any descendents;\u00a0 nor does the evidence positively show who inherited the warehouse at Andres' death, nor whether the latter, at the time he died, still continued to be the sole owner of the\u00a0 said building.\u00a0 According to an uncontradicted statement of one of the witnesses for the respondents, only six doors of the warehouse belonged to Andres, the rest belonging to Francisco.\u00a0 The evidence\u00a0 does not show\u00a0 how many doors the warehouse had.\u00a0\u00a0 It is certain, however,\u00a0 that the co-owners of the building, at the present time, are the petitioners and the respondents,\u00a0 the former's share being\u00a0 six-sevenths of one-half of the said warehouse.\u00a0 Counsel for the petitioners applied\u00a0 to the court for authorization to sell this share of theirs and the part of the land claimed by\u00a0 them on which the building was erected.\u00a0 The respondents, as the successors in\u00a0 interest of Francisco Fontanilla, opposed\u00a0 the petition, in\u00a0 so far as it related to the lot, and alleged that the latter belonged solely and exclusively to\u00a0 them and that the co-ownership held with them by the petitioners was limited solely to the warehouse.<p>The argument of the respondents is, that Francisco Fontanilla merely loaned the said lot to his brother Andres in order that the latter might build on it the aforementioned warehouse.\u00a0 We understand this to mean, in other words, that\u00a0 Francisco\u00a0 ceded to Andres the\u00a0 usufruct of the lot, reserving\u00a0 to himself\u00a0 its ownership.\u00a0 The petitioners, on their part, maintain that Andres acquired full dominion over\u00a0 and the ownership\u00a0 of the said lot by having received it in exchange for another lot\u00a0 owned by\u00a0 him and which, consequently, he duly delivered to Francisco.<\/p><p>The trial\u00a0 court,\u00a0 in\u00a0 weighing the\u00a0 evidence, positively stated that <em>it had not obtained any evidence whatever<\/em> from the testimony, and decided\u00a0 the case in favor of the\u00a0 petitioners.\u00a0 From this\u00a0 judgment the respondents appealed.<\/p><p>Three\u00a0 witnesses testified\u00a0 in\u00a0 support of\u00a0 the\u00a0 claim\u00a0 made by the petitioners, and all three averred that the said lot belonged in the beginning to Francisco Fontanilla, but that afterwards a contract of exchange was executed\u00a0 between the latter and Andres Fontanilla, whereby the first ceded the said lot in exchange for the share that Andres possessed in another lot owned jointly by both.\u00a0 It is to be noted, however, that none\u00a0 of these witnesses testified positively and of their own knowledge, but gave mere hearsay\u00a0 testimony only, as concerns\u00a0 the alleged fact of\u00a0 the exchange. The first of them, one Simon Cristobal, testified that he became informed of this fact by its having been\u00a0 told to him by Andres\u00a0 Fontanilla; another of them, the petitioner herself, Ruperta Pascual, testified\u00a0 that she knew of the exchange because she was\u00a0 told of\u00a0 it by the said Simon\u00a0 Cristobal\u00a0 and by her deceased husband, it was not stated who the latter was, but of course he was\u00a0 neither Andres nor Francisco Fontanilla; and the\u00a0 third witness, Felix Villanueva, one of the petitioners represented\u00a0 in the trial by Ruperta Pascual, testified that he knew of the alleged exchange because his father, a few moments before he\u00a0 died; told him of it.\u00a0 It appears that the father of this witness was one Concordio Fontanilla, whose relationship with Andres and Francisco Fontanilla is not clearly shown in the record.<\/p><p>It is of course manifest that such testimony is insufficient to prove the exchange alleged by the petitioners.\u00a0 On the other hand there is the following testimony in the respondents behalf:\u00a0 <\/p><ol><li>That of Alejandra Mina, one of the petitioners and a daughter-in-law of Francisco Fontanilla, who testified that the latter loaned\u00a0 the\u00a0 lot to his brother Andres with\u00a0 the understanding that the warehouse, which the latter would build on it, should eventually become the property of a son of Francisco's named\u00a0 Fructuoso, whom Andres, who had no children, had adopted and considered as his own, although this transfer did not take place as Fructuoso died and was survived by Andres; that she was certain of the\u00a0 loan\u00a0 of the lot as she was present at the time of the execution of the contract concerning this matter by the two brothers; that the agreement was verbal and was not recorded in writing, owing to the confidence and harmony that existed between the latter; that after\u00a0 the partition of Francisco's estate, several years before, and\u00a0 the witness had taken possession of the part thereof that pertained to her, she had, on several occasions, demanded\u00a0 of the petitioner,\u00a0 Ruperta Pascual, payment of\u00a0 the rent of the lot occupied by the warehouse, the latter always asking to be excused because she had not the money to pay it,\u00a0 as\u00a0 she was poor; and that, finally, witness proposed to the said Pascual the purchase of the warehouse on the supposition that the lot was not to be included, which purchase was not made merely because of a difference of P15 in the price.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 <\/li>\u00a0 <li>That of the Chinaman, Qui-Quiengco, a tenant of the warehouse, as it appears, since the time it was constructed. This witness testified that the lot was loaned by Francisco Fontanilla to his\u00a0 (the latter's) brother\u00a0 for the\u00a0 borrower to build\u00a0 thereon the said warehouse; and that he knew of that circumstance because it had been told to him by Andres himself when the latter and his brother Francisco had talked with him in regard to his helping to put up the building.\u00a0 Witness further testified\u00a0 that Andres also\u00a0 told him that Francisco might be at\u00a0 ease with respect to his lot because, as he (Andres) had no children, Francisco's children, at all events, would inherit the warehouse\u00a0 which he (Andres) was going to build. <br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>The testimony of Isaias Clemente, formerly the testamentary executor of the deceased Concordio Fontanilla, from whom, it appears, are derived the petitioners' rights.\u00a0 This witness testified that, in effecting the\u00a0 partition of the said deceased's\u00a0 estate, he delivered to the petitioners in accordance\u00a0 with the testator's\u00a0 wishes, the\u00a0 warehouse only and not the lot on which it was\u00a0 built.<\/li><\/ol><p>All this testimony, given from those witnesses' own positive knowledge and uncontradicted by any other of a similar nature, sufficiently supports, in our opinion, the respondents' claim, especially\u00a0 if\u00a0 account is taken of the fact, which strongly corroborates the same, that the title deed of the litigated lot still remains in the name of Francisco Fontanilla and is held by his successors, the respondents.\u00a0 This shows that the property\u00a0 was not conveyed to Andres Fontanilla, for if such had been the case, it is natural and logical that the transfer would have been\u00a0 recorded at the bottom\u00a0 of the said deed or that instrument would have been delivered to the Baid Andres, which is the least that could and ought to have been done to have accredited in some manner such transfer, in the event that it had been thought unnecessary, for any reason, to have expressed in due form the exchange alleged by the petitioners.\u00a0 What is certain is that the latter presented no good proof of such exchange, for which reason it can not\u00a0 be held to be proven that the said contract was actually made nor that, by virtue thereof, Andres Fontanilla acquired the ownership of the lot in question inasmuch\u00a0 as contracts may not be presumed\u00a0 but\u00a0 must\u00a0 be proven,\u00a0 in order that they may\u00a0 produce due legal effect.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither is the fact that the latter held the possession of the disputed lot for more than twenty years, proof of the prior execution of the said contract of exchange, since possession, considered in itself, may be derived from\u00a0 or be the result of juridical acts that have nothing at\u00a0 all to do with such a contract; Andres, for instance, might very well have had possession through the mere tolerance of\u00a0 the\u00a0 owner of the lot, or by an express cession which the latter may have made to him of the usufruct of the same, as the respondents claim and have sufficiently proved.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither may the petitioners invoke, in the\u00a0 present case, the presumption of ownership derived from possession,\u00a0 since such presumption\u00a0 is\u00a0 completely destroyed by the aforementioned proof, which shows positively that Francisco Fontanilla was the real owner of the lot and that he never conveyed the ownership\u00a0 thereof, but only the usufruct, to his brother Andres.<\/p><p>The judgment appealed from\u00a0 is reversed, and it is decreed that the respondents are the owners of the said lot.\u00a0 No express finding is made as to the\u00a0 costs of either instance.

The plaintiff therefore prayed that judgment be rendered\u00a0 in his\u00a0 behalf and against the defendant for\u00a0 the sum of P7,500.79, the amount in which he estimated such injury arid' damage, together with interest thereon\u00a0 and the costs,\u00a0 and that the court further give exemplary damages to the plaintiff in whatsoever amount might be deemed just and equitable.<\/p><p>The defendant company, on December 1, 1910, presented, in writing, a\u00a0 demurrer to the aforementioned complaint, basing the same\u00a0 on the grounds\u00a0 that the complaint did\u00a0 not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,\u00a0 and was ambiguous,\u00a0 unintelligible, and vague;\u00a0 and asked that the complaint be dismissed, with the\u00a0 costs\u00a0 against\u00a0 the plaintiff.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 case having come before the court for a hearing on the demurrer, the judge, on the 16th of the\u00a0 aforesaid month, issued an order sustaining the demurrer, to which ruling an exception was taken by the plaintiff.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 plaintiff,\u00a0 by an order of January 7, having been granted a delay for the purpose of amending his complaint, his counsel entered an\u00a0 exception thereto in writing and stated that his client did not desire to amend his original complaint; therefore the defendant, in turn, requested that the case be dismissed, and the court, by an\u00a0 order of January 26, 1911, dismissed the action with the costs in favor of the defendant.\u00a0 An exception to this ruling was taken by the plaintiff, who announced his intention to\u00a0 appeal to this court, and for such purpose filed the proper bill of exceptions, which was certified and\u00a0 duly forwarded.<\/p><p>The claim,\u00a0 made\u00a0 by the plaintiff\u00a0 against the defendant company, of an indemnity\u00a0 for injury and damage, is based on the\u00a0 allegation that the latter, maliciously and without cause, filed a\u00a0 complaint in the municipal court of this city,\u00a0 charging the former, to his detriment,\u00a0 with having committed the crime\u00a0 of estafa or embezzlement of P22, which was untrue, for the defendant could not prove the charge, and, because of such lack of proof, the municipal court had to dismiss the action and release the defendant, the herein plaintiff, who alleges that,\u00a0 as a result of that libelous accusation\u00a0 filed without just\u00a0 cause,\u00a0 he\u00a0 suffered injury and damage to\u00a0 the\u00a0 amount of P7,500.79.<\/p><p>The action\u00a0 prosecuted by the plaintiff originates\u00a0 in the fact that he was accused by the defendant company, without probable cause, with having committed the crime of <em>estafa,<\/em> such\u00a0 charge being filed before a judicial authority who dismissed the complaint for lack of proof in\u00a0 its support. The propriety of the said action depends upon whether the judge before whom the charge was heard,\u00a0 certified that the accusation was\u00a0 in fact false and libelous, since from this circumstance is\u00a0 derived the right of the person libeled, or falsely accused, to\u00a0 prosecute\u00a0 the false accuser and to demand from\u00a0 him an indemnity for\u00a0 injury and damage.<\/p><p>Article 326 of the Penal\u00a0 Code prescribes that:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The crime of false accusation or denunciation is committed by falsely\u00a0 imputing to any person acts which, if they were true, would constitute a crime that would give rise to proceedings ex\u00a0 officio if the imputation were\u00a0 made before an\u00a0 administrative or judicial official who would be obliged to proceed to its\u00a0 investigation\u00a0 or\u00a0 punishment\u00a0 by reason of his office.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"The denouncer or accuser, however,\u00a0 shall not be proceeded against unless by virtue of a final sentence or writ, equally final, of the court which took\u00a0 cognizance of the crime imputed, dismissing the complaint.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"The latter shall proceed ex officio against the denouncer or accuser, provided that\u00a0 the principal cause should show sufficient grounds for instituting a new action.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In harmony with\u00a0 these provisions of the Penal\u00a0 Code, article 795 of the <em>Compilation reformada\u00a0 de las\u00a0 disposiciones sobre el Enjuiciamiento Criminal,<\/em> provides\u00a0 that, in the\u00a0 first case of the article\u00a0 above quoted,\u00a0 which is\u00a0 when the\u00a0 act which gave rise to the institution\u00a0 of the cause is not\u00a0 proved,\u00a0 it may be certified by\u00a0 the\u00a0 court in\u00a0 ordering the dismissal that the bringing of the action\u00a0 has not injured the reputation of the parties prosecuted or of any of them.<\/p><p>The court may also, at\u00a0 the instance of the party prosecuted, reserve to the latter the right to sue the complainant\u00a0 for false\u00a0 accusation.<\/p><p>Article 638 of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ley\u00a0 de Enjuiciamiento Criminal\u00a0<\/span> of 1882 (Law\u00a0 of Criminal\u00a0 Procedure)\u00a0 contains analogous provisions, which are cited on account of their agreement with the preinserted article of the Penal Code.<\/p><p>It is concluded from the\u00a0 legal provisions aforementioned, that the false imputation of\u00a0 crimes of a private character does not constitute the crime of libelous denunciation\u00a0 or accusation, punished\u00a0 by the\u00a0 said article 326 of the Penal Code.<\/p><p>It is true that the. plaintiff was accused before a judicial authority\u00a0 with having committed\u00a0 the crime of <em>estafa,<\/em> an accusation\u00a0 which afterwards\u00a0 could not be proved, wherefore the complaint was dismissed and the plaintiff in this cause,\u00a0 William\u00a0 A. Grattage, was\u00a0 released.\u00a0 The act of which he was accused, wrongfully and without just cause, might be a crime of a public character which could be the subject matter\u00a0 of an action by the prosecuting officer; and the\u00a0 decision or order\u00a0 of dismissal by the\u00a0 municipal judge, directing his release, is of a definite and final character; but, notwithstanding these circumstances, the fact is\u00a0 that the judge, in determining\u00a0 the\u00a0 matter,\u00a0 abstained from\u00a0 making an\u00a0 explicit statement\u00a0 that\u00a0 the accusation presented by the complaining witness was false and libelous; neither did he order\u00a0 that the latter be\u00a0 proceeded against through\u00a0 an information\u00a0 by the prosecuting officer.\u00a0 For this reason, to wit, because of the lack of such certification that the accusation made against the herein plaintiff,\u00a0 Grattage, was false and libelous,\u00a0 it would be improper, pursuant to the\u00a0 provisions of the Penal Code,\u00a0 to hold that the said accuser incurred criminal liability, or that\u00a0 he\u00a0 is civilly liable\u00a0 for the injury\u00a0 and damage occasioned by that unproved accusation, not certified to be false by the judge before whom the case was\u00a0 tried; for, in accordance with article 17 of the Penal\u00a0 Code,\u00a0 civil\u00a0 liability is\u00a0 always a consequence of criminal responsibility in the cases of crimes that give rise to a criminal action and to\u00a0 the consequent civil liability.<\/p><p>So, then,\u00a0 according to an\u00a0 express\u00a0 provision of the\u00a0 code, in order\u00a0 that an action instituted for the recovery of an indemnity for injury and damage, as a result of\u00a0 a\u00a0 false denunciation\u00a0 or\u00a0 libelous\u00a0 accusation,\u00a0 may\u00a0 be proper\u00a0 and maintainable\u00a0 before\u00a0 the\u00a0 courts,\u00a0 it is indispensable\u00a0 that, in the judgment whereby the accused and libeled\u00a0 person is absolved, or\u00a0 in\u00a0 the order of\u00a0 final dismissal,\u00a0 the said denunciation or\u00a0 accusation\u00a0 be,\u00a0 as provided by the penal law, expressly certified to\u00a0 be false and libelous; otherwise, the action can not prosper.<\/p><p>In the case\u00a0 of\u00a0 Gonzalez\u00a0 Quiros <em>vs.<\/em> Palanca Tan-Guinlay (5 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 675), the following doctrine was established:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"No\u00a0 civil action for damages\u00a0 on\u00a0 account of malicious prosecution can be maintained unless the court, in acquitting the\u00a0 defendant of the\u00a0 criminal charge, orders a\u00a0 criminal prosecution to be commenced against the complaining witness for false accusation.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In the same decision it is said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Article 326 of the Penal\u00a0 Code provides,\u00a0 as we have held in the\u00a0 case of United States <em>vs<\/em>.\u00a0 Agustina\u00a0 Barrera (4 Phil. Rep., 461), that no prosecution\u00a0 for a false accusation or complaint in\u00a0 a criminal\u00a0 case\u00a0 can be commenced unless the judge, in dismissing the first complaint, orders a complaint to be filed against the complaining witness for false\u00a0 accusation.\u00a0 The judgment dismissing the complaint\u00a0 against the defendant contained\u00a0 no such\u00a0 provision. We hold\u00a0 that\u00a0 this article applies\u00a0 not\u00a0 only\u00a0 to a criminal proceeding\u00a0 against the complaining witness,\u00a0 but also\u00a0 to civil proceedings, and that no\u00a0 action to recover damages in a civil suit can be maintained\u00a0 by the\u00a0 person arrested against the person presenting the complaint, unless in the order\u00a0 acquitting\u00a0 the\u00a0 person\u00a0 arrested\u00a0 the\u00a0 judge\u00a0 certifies that the complaint was malicious, as required by said article 326.\u00a0 The defendant in this case, therefore,\u00a0 is not entitled to recover any damages by reason of the criminal prosecution\u00a0 against him.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Said decision was a confirmation\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 legal doctrine constantly followed by the\u00a0 courts of these Islands; it agrees with that established\u00a0 in\u00a0 Spain, and is in\u00a0 harmony with the provisions of the penal laws in force in that country, which\u00a0 are analogous to those\u00a0 that govern in this Archipelago.\u00a0 We therefore abstain\u00a0 from citing in this decision laws of Spain and decisions of the\u00a0 Spanish supreme court. By what has been herein before stated,\u00a0 and\u00a0 by the quotation from a former decision of this court, the\u00a0 impropriety of the action prosecuted by the plaintiff\u00a0 for injury and damage has been demonstrated.<\/p><p>If the latter had immediately petitioned the court that dismissed\u00a0 the complaint, to certify, pursuant\u00a0 to the provisions of the Penal Code, that the accusation\u00a0 of estafa made\u00a0 against him was false, perhaps he would\u00a0 have succeeded in obtaining such\u00a0 a certification;\u00a0 but the person accused, now the\u00a0 plaintiff, William A. Grattage, not having so done, this court can not lawfully authorize a continuance of the said action, nor can it reverse the order of December 16, 1910, sustaining the demurrer.<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 whereby\u00a0 the errors assigned to the\u00a0 order appealed from, which is\u00a0 sustained\u00a0 as to its dispositive part\u00a0 upon the grounds herein\u00a0 set forth, are held\u00a0 to\u00a0 have been answered\u00a0 and refuted, the said order and that of January 26\u00a0 of the current year are affirmed with the costs against the appellant.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

This petition was granted and the defendants having been notified, they alleged in\u00a0 writing, on the 14th of the\u00a0 same month, that they had been notified on the 3d of July of the said writ by the\u00a0 sheriff of Nueva Ecija and since\u00a0 then had complied with the Order\u00a0 of the court, but called\u00a0 attention to the fact that the stream had been closed by two tenants of the\u00a0 defendant, Alejandro\u00a0 Cajucom, on the\u00a0 1st of the preceding month\u00a0 of July, since which\u00a0 date neither they, the defendants, nor any other person in their representation, had done anything whatever to the stream' or ditch in question; wherefore they prayed that\u00a0 the two men who closed the said stream be examined, and that, in\u00a0 view of such facts, the charge of contempt of court be dismissed, and the plaintiffs be sentenced to pay the costs, and the, damages occasioned.<br\/><br\/>The court, after the witnesses\u00a0 summoned had been examined, decided, on August 20, 1908, that the <i>defendants had committed contempt of court and imposed upon\u00a0 each of them a fine of P200<\/i>, and imprisonment until they should duly comply with the writ of injunction, and sentenced\u00a0 each of them to pay one-half\u00a0 of the costs.<br\/><br\/>Defendants excepted to this judgment and, the required bill of exceptions having been submitted, the Supreme Court, in its decision of January 11,\u00a0 [31]\u00a0 1910,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> dismissed\u00a0 the appeal oh the ground that the said bill\u00a0 of exceptions had been\u00a0 improperly\u00a0 admitted,\u00a0 inasmuch\u00a0 as the\u00a0 order\u00a0 issued in connection with the incidental\u00a0 question of contempt of court, could be reviewed only after the rendition of judgment on the\u00a0 main issue, and not until then could the\u00a0 said incident of contempt be, by means of a\u00a0 bill of exceptions, submitted to this court; therefore the records in the\u00a0 case were\u00a0 remanded to the court below, later to be transmitted to the clerk of this court upon the\u00a0 filing of\u00a0 the main\u00a0 record with the bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>By the writ of preliminary injunction issued on June 26, 1908, the original of which is on\u00a0 file, page 7 of the main record,\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 Alejandro and Timoteo\u00a0 Cajucom, their\u00a0 attorneys, representatives and agents, were enjoined from\u00a0 performing any act whatever that might tend to close and obstruct\u00a0 the canal, a branch, called Paligui ng Buquid Puntang Piniping, of an <i>estero<\/i> situated in the\u00a0 barrio of Biga of the pueblo of Bongabon, Nueva Ecija, and to cease to obstruct or hinder the course of the water that\u00a0 should flow through the said branch.<br\/><br\/>In the written complaint presented on June 22, 1908, it is averred that the said canal or estero was\u00a0 closed by the representatives of the defendants, on the\u00a0 1st of June of the year therein stated, and that since then the water which it ordinarily carried had ceased to flow through it, the plaintiffs' lands thereby being deprived of irrigation.\u00a0\u00a0 So that when the writ of injunction was issued on the 26th of the said month,\u00a0 it was taken for granted that the estero or canal in question was\u00a0 closed and that the water\u00a0 did not run through it, as occurred prior to the said 1st of June; and counsel\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs, in charging, by a\u00a0 writing of\u00a0 July\u00a0 6, 1908, that contempt\u00a0 of\u00a0 court\u00a0 was committed, stated that the defendants,\u00a0 according to the information he\u00a0 had,\u00a0 were still obstructing and hindering the\u00a0 passage of the water, in disobedience of the\u00a0 writ of injunction.<br\/><br\/>The defendants having been notified to show cause why they should\u00a0 not\u00a0 be punished for contempt of court and disobedience\u00a0 of the preliminary\u00a0 injunction issued by the court, answered that since the 3d of July, the date\u00a0 when they were notified by the deputy sheriff, they had complied with the prohibitory order and had not done anything whatever, by themselves or through others in their representation^ to the stream or ditch in question, which was closed by two tenants of one of the defendants, Alejandro Cajucom, on\u00a0 June\u00a0 1, 1908, as acknowledged by said tenants.<br\/><br\/>The writ issued by the court contained no order.instructing the defendants to raise or remove the obstructions that prevented the water from flowing through the said\u00a0 canal or ditch.<br\/><br\/>The canal\u00a0 was obstructed and closed\u00a0 on June 1st, and when the persons who closed it were notified on July 3 that they should\u00a0 abstain\u00a0 from performing any\u00a0 act\u00a0 whatever tending\u00a0 to obstruct and\u00a0 prevent the flow of water,\u00a0 the canal or ditch still remained closed,\u00a0 and the record shows no\u00a0 proof that it was\u00a0 afterwards\u00a0 opened to the passage of water, nor that, after the defendants had been notified of the injunction, they again closed it.\u00a0 The fact that the latter failed to remove the obstruction they had placed in the said canal or <i>estero<\/i> for the purpose of\u00a0 preventing the passage of the water, since\u00a0 they were not\u00a0 ordered so to do\u00a0 by the judicial writ, is not sufficient to make them liable for contempt of court.<br\/><br\/>The act of the closing of the canal occurred prior to the issuance of the writ, and,\u00a0 since a thing that has already been done can not be prohibited, by the mere fact of there not having been done what was not ordered in the writ it can not be held that a judicial order was disobeyed and willfully disregarded.<br\/><br\/>Section\u00a0 162 of the Code of Civil Procedure prescribes:<br\/><blockquote>\"An injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to refrain from a particular act.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The said writ prohibited the performance of any\u00a0 act that would obstruct, close, or hinder the course of the water through the Piniping canal or creek, when it was already obstructed and closed; and as the removal of the\u00a0 impediment or obstruction\u00a0 was not ordered, the defendants were not obliged to perform any particular act, and their inaction in leaving the canal closed does not\u00a0 constitute contempt of court, as they did not violate any judicial prohibition.<br\/><br\/>The record shows that the prohibition was issued after the closing of the canal;\u00a0 hence, if the defendants\u00a0 did not remove the obstruction,\u00a0 there disobeyed no order.\u00a0 In the syllabus of decision No.\u00a0 1697, Municipal council of Santa Rosa <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Provincial\u00a0 Board of La Laguna\u00a0 (3 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 206), the\u00a0 rule was laid down that the commission of an act already done can not be\u00a0 enjoined.\u00a0\u00a0 To say that it could, would be nonsense.<br\/><center><br\/>THE\u00a0 MAIN ISSUE.<br\/><\/center> <br\/>On January 28,1909, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, with the\u00a0 permission of the court, wherein they alleged\u00a0 that certain\u00a0 of them named Maria\u00a0 Marcelo, Crisanto Rubio, Alipio Espanol or\u00a0 Estanol, Marcelo Mantile, Adriano Espanol or\u00a0 Estanol, Sebastian Bancod, Claudio Angeles, Diego\u00a0 Santiago, Raymun do Santiago, Anacletode los Reyes, Rafael Mendoza; Clemente Alivia,\u00a0 Marcelino Fajardo, and Segundo Ramos had been, on or about June 1, 1908, and were at the time, the proprietors and owners of rice\u00a0 lands\u00a0 situated in the barrio\u00a0 of\u00a0 Biga of the pueblo of Bongabon, and\u00a0 that the other plaintiffs were planters and cultivators of some portions of the said lands; that (following the statement in the complaint as to the boundaries or adjacent\u00a0 lands of each of their respective properties)\u00a0 the said Paligui ng Buquid Puntang Piniping <i>estero<\/i> or creek existed and had always existed in the afore-mentioned barrio; that\u00a0 water flowed through it on or about June 1, 1908, and the plaintiffs used that water in the cultivation of their above-mentioned lands; that, on or about the date aforesaid, the defendants, by themselves and\u00a0 through their agents and representatives, obstructed and closed the mouth of the estero in such manner that the lands described\u00a0 were deprived of the water that had flowed and should flow through the said estero; that, on or about the 4th of October of the same year before\u00a0 mentioned, the\u00a0 continual heavy\u00a0 rains and high floods carried away the obstruction in the said Paligui ng Buquid\u00a0 Puntang Piniping <i>estero<\/i>; that, in view of the statements made by\u00a0 the defendants,\u00a0 they believed that the latter would again close the\u00a0 <i>estero<\/i> in order to obstruct the passage\u00a0 of the water to their (the plaintiffs') properties; and that the plaintiffs, through the closing of the said\u00a0 estero or creek,\u00a0 suffered losses and damages in\u00a0 the following amounts:\u00a0 Maria Marcelo, P1,500; Crisanto Rubio, P250; Alipio Espanol, P75; Marcelo Mantile,P2,500; Adriano Espanol, P75; Sebastian Bancod, P400;\u00a0 Gregorio Corpus, P150;\u00a0 Claudio\u00a0 Angeles, P250; Doroteo Dacuno, P250; Fernando Polintan, P250; Maximino Fajardo, P200; Catalino Rubio, P300; Alejandro Caisip, P270; Diego Santiago, P800; Eugenio Ronquillo, P486; Raymundo Santiago, P55O; Simeon [Simon] de la Cruz,\u00a0 P480; Anacleto de los Reyes,P180; Rafael Mendoza, P300; Marcelino\u00a0 Fajardo, P340; Tomas Marcelo, P270; Inocencio Santiago, P375; Eugenio Angeles, P375; Geronimo Rojas, P135; Segundo Ramos, P390, and Clemente Alivia, P219; and\u00a0 the\u00a0 complaint concluded by asking the court to render judgment against the defendants, and, at the termination of the trial, to issue a perpetual injunction enjoining them from closing the said estero or creek, or in any manner obstructing the course of the water therein, and furthermore, to sentence them to pay to the\u00a0 plaintiffs the losses and\u00a0 damages suffered by them, and the costs of the suit.<br\/><br\/>On February 11, 1909, the defendants' counsel, answering the amended complaint, made a general denial of each and all the allegations\u00a0 of the said complaint arid alleged, as a special defense, that the irrigation canal in question belonged to\u00a0 the defendants; that the mouth of the said Paligui ng Buquid Puntang Piniping canal did\u00a0 not\u00a0 previously exist and was opened only at the request of Marcelo Mantile; and that the plaintiffs' lands were provided with another irrigation ditch independent of the one\u00a0 herein\u00a0 concerned. Said counsel therefore prayed that his clients be absolved from the complaint, that the irrigation\u00a0 canal in question be declared\u00a0 to belong to the defendants, and\u00a0 that the plaintiffs be sentenced to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>On April 26, 1909, the case came\u00a0 up for hearing, testimony was adduced by both parties\u00a0 and the court,\u00a0 after consideration\u00a0 of the evidence, rendered judgment on July 26, 1909, enjoining the defendant Alejandro\u00a0 Cajucom from closing the Paligui ng Buquid Puntang Piniping estero or creek, or in any manner obstructing the course of the water running therein.\u00a0 The preliminary injunction issued against the defendant, his agents and representatives, by the Hon. Judge\u00a0 Estanislao Yusay, was thus rendered\u00a0 perpetual, and the said defendant was sentenced to pay the following sums, for losses and damages: To Maria Marcelo, P196.50; Crisanto Rubio, P139.50;\u00a0 Alipio Espafiol, P75;\u00a0 Marcelo Mantile,\u00a0 P800.25; Adriano Espanol,\u00a0 P75; Sebastian Bancod, P142.50; Gregorio Corpus, P90.12; Claudio Angeles, P97.87; Doroteo Dacuno, P90.37; Fernando Polintan,\u00a0 P80.87; Maximino Fajardo, P75.37;\u00a0 Alejandro\u00a0 Caisip, P75; Catalino Rubio, P84; Diego Santiago, P131.25; Eugenio\u00a0 Ronquillo, P181.25; Raymundo Santiago,\u00a0 P540; Simon\u00a0 de la Cruz, P135;\u00a0 Anacleto de los Reyes, P90; Rafael Mendoza, P195; Marcelino Fajardo, P180; Geronimo Rojas,\u00a0 P90; Segundo Ramos, P210; Clemente Alivia, P109.50, and to Tomas Marcelo,\u00a0 Inocencio\u00a0 Santiago,\u00a0 and Eugenio\u00a0 Angeles, tenants-on-shares of Maria Marcelo, the sum of P196.50.\u00a0 Counsel for the defendant, Alejandro Cajucom, excepted to this judgment and prayed for a new trial on the grounds that the said judgment was not\u00a0 sufficiently supported by the\u00a0 weight\u00a0 of the evidence and was contrary to\u00a0 law.\u00a0 This motion was overruled by an\u00a0 order of September 2 and exception thereto was taken by the appellant who duly filed the proper bill of exceptions, which was\u00a0 certified to and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the appellants having been authorized, by an order of February\u00a0 12, 1910, to present\u00a0 the facts relative to the charge of contempt of court, as an\u00a0 incident\u00a0 of the main issue,\u00a0 and\u00a0 upon his petition, the Supreme Court ruled that the bill of exceptions relative to the matter of the contempt of court,\u00a0 together with the evidence therewith submitted, should be held to be an integral part of the,said main issue with the bill of exceptions thereto pertaining.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the main\u00a0 issue\u00a0 of this\u00a0 suit,\u00a0 the\u00a0 object of the plaintiffs\u00a0 is to obtain from the court\u00a0 an order decreeing\u00a0 the\u00a0 former preliminary\u00a0 injunction to be\u00a0 perpetual. This claim,\u00a0 which\u00a0 is opposed by the\u00a0 defendants, presupposes a right on the part\u00a0 of the plaintiffs to use and profit by the water that runs through the Piniping <i>estero<\/i> or creek, to the benefit of their respective agricultural lands.<br\/><br\/>The law applicable to the present contention is found\u00a0 in articles 407 to 425\u00a0 of the Civil Code, in the last of which it\u00a0 is provided:<br\/><br\/>\"In all that is not expressly determined by the provisions of this chapter, the special law of waters shall be observed.\"<br\/><br\/>This law is that of August 3, 1866, which was extended ta the Philippine Islands by the royal decree of the\u00a0 8th of the same month\u00a0 and year and published with the Deereto de <i>cumplase<\/i>\u00a0 of the <i>Gobierno General<\/i>\u00a0 of September 21,\u00a0 1871, in the Official Gazette of\u00a0 the 24th\u00a0 of the same month and year, on\u00a0 account of the subsequent law of June 13,\u00a0 1879, in force\u00a0 in\u00a0 Spain,\u00a0 not having been promulgated in\u00a0 these Islands.\u00a0\u00a0 It contains,\u00a0 among others, the provisions found in articles 30 to 65 applicable to the case at bar.<br\/><br\/>The scant data\u00a0 and the\u00a0 insufficiency of the\u00a0 evidence offered by the\u00a0 record, preclude this court's deciding,\u00a0 in accordance with the law, upon the pleadings and the proofs submitted by the parties, the several issues raised in the course of this litigation, and for this reason we esteem it proper that the\u00a0 case\u00a0 be reopened for the\u00a0 conduct of the following proceedings:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>An ocular inspection shall be made by the justice\u00a0 or auxiliary justice of the\u00a0 peace,\u00a0 attended\u00a0 by expert\u00a0 surveyors - one of which latter to be appointed by each of the parties to the suit\u00a0 for the purpose of determining whether the water from the <i>estero<\/i> named\u00a0 Sapang Cabasan issues from a spring called\u00a0 Sibul; whether this spring and the said <i>estero<\/i> are upon the land owned by the defendants,\u00a0 and, if not, who is the\u00a0 owner of the\u00a0 land on\u00a0 which they are located, and whether he is a third person who is not a party to this suit.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>Whether the creek,\u00a0 <i>estero<\/i>, or ditch,\u00a0 named\u00a0 Paligui Puntang Piniping, is connected or united with the\u00a0 Sapang Cabasan<i> estero<\/i>, and whether the\u00a0 said\u00a0 Puntang Piniping creek or canal crosses\u00a0 the lands of defendants or those\u00a0 of the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>\u00a0To ascertain at what point or place either of the\u00a0 said Cabasan or Piniping canals was closed; whether the closure was made on the land of defendants or on that of the plaintiffs, and whether,\u00a0 on\u00a0 account of\u00a0 such closure, the course of the water was completely obstructed and prevented from entering the lands of the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>4.

He died on May 15,1881, leaving a widow,\u00a0 Angela Echarri, and a daughter named Luisa Perez Echarri, who on March 28,1904, sold the said lot to Inocente Echarri, and the latter erected\u00a0 thereon a house\u00a0 valued at P8,000.\u00a0 <p>On July 22,1908,\u00a0 or twenty-seven\u00a0 years after the decease of\u00a0 Antonio Perez, the original\u00a0 owner of\u00a0 the lot,\u00a0 certain parties named Gregoria Castro and Mercedes Calderon sued Inocente Echarri for five-twelfths of said lot, calling themselves\u00a0 daughters of one Maria and nieces of\u00a0 one\u00a0 Justa whom\u00a0 they say were daughters\u00a0 of Antonio Perez in his first marriage with a woman named Eugenia Garcia.\u00a0 The Court of First Instance of the city of Manila awarded them 8,333.33\/17,500 of the\u00a0 lot.<\/p><p>Defendant appealed, and from this appeal, with the briefs of the litigants, it appears:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><ol><li> That it is\u00a0 a fact proven by the purchase deed that the original owner of\u00a0 the lot was Antonio Perez,\u00a0 without any mention whatsoever in said\u00a0 deed that he was married.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><\/li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <li>That in no way, either by documentary or oral evidence,\u00a0 has it been directly proven by\u00a0 the plaintiffs that at that time he was married to any woman with whom he must under the law share\u00a0 the property acquired\u00a0 during marriage.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><\/li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <li>That it is an established fact, admitted by both parties, that Antonio\u00a0 Perez was\u00a0 married\u00a0 in 1872\u00a0 to Maria Meneses, by whom he\u00a0 had a son, but both said wife and son died\u00a0 before Antonio Perez did;\u00a0 so that they\u00a0 in no way figure\u00a0 in this suit.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><\/li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <li>That it is also an\u00a0 established\u00a0 fact, admitted by both parties, that Antonio Perez at his death left a widow named Angela Echarri and a daughter by her, Luisa Perez Echarri.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <li>That this Luisa Perez Echarri is the only person who appears undoubtedly to be the successor in interest and the heir of Antonio Perez\u00a0 by\u00a0 operation of law,\u00a0 both\u00a0 in\u00a0 the testate and the intestate succession.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 <\/li><li>That it appears from a\u00a0 piece of documentary evidence, consisting of an authentic\u00a0 public\u00a0 document,\u00a0 that\u00a0 before dying Antonio Perez executed a will; but this will could not be produced, and therefore his final\u00a0 statements and dispositions can not be known.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <li>That for the purpose of making a partition of inheritance in the intestate succession of Antonio Perez in which.\" the plaintiffs may figure, it is\u00a0 in every way necessary to prove that the original owner married Eugenia Garcia before he\u00a0 married his\u00a0 other\u00a0 two\u00a0 successive wives,\u00a0 whose marriages are satisfactorily proven; that he was already married to Eugenia Garcia when he purchased the\u00a0 lot in question; that in this first marriage he had two daughters, named Maria and Justa; and that from Maria sprang legitimately, that is, as daughters of a legal marriage\u00a0 under the laws then in force,\u00a0 Gregoria\u00a0 de Castro and Mercedes Calderon,\u00a0 who claim to be the lawful granddaughters of Antonio Perez.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <li>That there is not the least evidence in the record\u00a0 of the fact that Gregoria de Castro\u00a0 and Mercedes Calderon are the lawful daughters of\u00a0 this Maria;\u00a0 that there is only fragmentary evidence of the fact that this Maria was the lawful daughter of Antonio Perez.<\/li><\/ol><p>These facts are denied in the defendant's reply, and\u00a0 in the brief accompanying his\u00a0 assignment of errors,\u00a0 in arguing upon the second assignment of error, he elucidates with a prolixity of data the legal impossibility of such facts.\u00a0 But such contention need not be considered\u00a0 here, especially as there are other arguments\u00a0 more conclusive, which the court must necessarily consider.<\/p><p>These arguments are\u00a0 as follows:<\/p><p>The present action does not concern a partition of inheritance but\u00a0 is an\u00a0 action for recovery against a third\u00a0 party who possesses the lot in question by single deed of purchase. This third party is not a\u00a0 successor\u00a0 in interest of Antonio Perez, and thus called upon either to defend or impugn the rights of\u00a0 succession\u00a0 of\u00a0 the alleged children\u00a0 of Antonio Perez, but he is the sole successor of Luisa Perez in ownership and possession of said lot, for the acquisition of which he had before him facts\u00a0 and documents that have not been denied, not even indirectly, nor in\u00a0 any way impugned.\u00a0 He is now disturbed in his possession by this suit, based upon facts which he could\u00a0 not have conveniently taken into account\u00a0 when\u00a0 he made such acquisition in good faith, nor was he under obligation,\u00a0 in the ordinary course of business, to make any inquiries.<\/p><p>The facts contained in the title deeds to the lot in question, which\u00a0 that third party had before him in making his purchase, are established facts, adduced by the plaintiffs them- selves.\u00a0 He saw, first, in the original\u00a0 deed, that Inocencio and Perfecto Gallego, with a sister\u00a0 of theirs, were the true and lawful owners of the lot, which was perfectly identified in the deed by location, dimensions and boundaries; second, he saw how Inocencio and Perfecto Gallego, haVing become owners\u00a0 also of the part belonging to\u00a0 their sister, had on December 10,1868, sold the lot, described in the same terms as in the deed, to Antonio Perez, the sale having taken place in this city of Manila before a notary public who, for that purpose, witnessed a document, the most formal that could be drawn up for the contract;\u00a0 and,\u00a0 finally, he\u00a0 saw another public document also witnessed by a notary, beating date of January 11,\u00a0 1888, seven years after the death of Antonio Perez,\u00a0 wherein it appears that Angela Echarri, widow of Antonio Perez, sold with right of repurchase to a merchant of Manila, Antonio de Marcaida, said lot, identified by boundaries, dimensions and location, according to the foregoing documents of which mention has been made, and\u00a0 stating \"that said lot had been acquired\u00a0 by her deceased husband, Don Antonio Perez,\u00a0 according to the bill of sale executed on December 10, 1868, in the\u00a0 presence of the notary public, Don Baltazar de Ocampo,\u00a0 the original whereof, with\u00a0 another original document of ownership, was, exhibited at the time and read by me [says the notary] and after they had been signed by me were attached here-to, to which I certify.\"\u00a0 And although the period for the repurchase\u00a0 was one\u00a0 year, he saw that on December 17, 1888, the lot had been resold to Angela Echarri by Antonio de Marcaida.<\/p><p>This transaction of Angela Echarri's shows plainly: That she held the muniments of title to\u00a0 the lot; that she exclusively possessed\u00a0 the\u00a0 lot for\u00a0 seven years after the death of her husband, Antonio Perez; that during such time, no one had questioned the ownership or possession of the\u00a0 lot; and, therefore, that\u00a0 she could freely dispose of it by sale. and\u00a0 the purchaser,\u00a0 an intelligent\u00a0 merchant of this city, had no\u00a0 hesitation in\u00a0 buying it.<\/p><p>She held the lot and disposed of it, it may be supposed, in the name and\u00a0 on behalf of her daughter, Luisa Perez, who was then a minor, and who was apparently the\u00a0 one who lawfully owned it.\u00a0\u00a0 It was hers, as the legal heir of the deceased Antonio Perez, and his only successor in interest after his death; and when she became of age, she, on March 28, 1904, that is, after twenty-three years of undisturbed and peaceful possession, sold it to the defendant in this case.<\/p><p>The Maria who is said to be the mother of the plaintiffs, died in this city, in Calle Mercado, Intramuros, according to the\u00a0 certificate submitted; and there Mercedes Calderon says she lives.\u00a0 It does not appear that during her lifetime, and up to 1908, when she appears to have died, Maria made any pretense of being a co-owner of\u00a0 that lot; nor did\u00a0 she or Justa, who is also said to have been a daughter of Antonio Perez, institute any action for the partition of what was said to be a legacy of their alleged father.\u00a0 Only after the de.ath of Maria and of Justa was an attempt made to make a partition\u00a0 of\u00a0 Antonio\u00a0 Perez's\u00a0 legacy.<\/p><p>The following facts are clearly proven in this case:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><ol><li>That\u00a0 the defendant acquired\u00a0 the lot from one who, for twenty-seven years, was in fact\u00a0 before the world and in law, according to title deeds, the sole\u00a0 legal owner tfirough inheritance, to wit, Luisa Perez.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/li><li>That\u00a0 it in no way\u00a0 appears in the case that\u00a0 she possessed the\u00a0 lot jointly\u00a0 and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pro indiviso <\/span>with\u00a0 any other person having an\u00a0 equal or a better right than hers to the legacy of her father, Antonio Perez.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <li>That\u00a0 after May 16,\u00a0 1887, Luisa Perez's\u00a0 ownership was by\u00a0 individual title, as the\u00a0 only heir of Antonio Perez and the sole proprietor of the lot.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <li> That at no time has this\u00a0 sole proprietor been either judicially or extra judicially cited\u00a0 or\u00a0 questioned, so that she should understand her ownership\u00a0 to be in common or shared with other persons.\u00a0 <\/li><\/ol><p>The purchaser having bought the\u00a0 lot under these\u00a0 circumstances,\u00a0 he acquired it\u00a0 by a clear title, in a regular manner, and for a consideration.<\/p><p>So then, even supposing\u00a0 what\u00a0 is not\u00a0 proven\u00a0 - that is, that the plaintiffs\u00a0 really are legitimate descendants of the women whom they claims as their mothers, and that these latter\u00a0 were really\u00a0 legitimate daughters of Antonio Perez, with better or\u00a0 equal right over Luisa Perez - they can not, after twenty-seven\u00a0 years, disturb a third-party, the defendant, a purchaser in good faith, who at present holds the lot by a clear\u00a0 title, because he is thereby protected; for, even should\u00a0 the title be in some way\u00a0 defective, he would still be protected by the prescription for\u00a0 a period of ten, and even\u00a0 of twenty years,\u00a0 by which\u00a0 possession of real property may\u00a0 be obtained.\u00a0\u00a0 (Civil\u00a0 Code, arts. 1940 and 1957.)\u00a0 In the\u00a0 present case\u00a0 the defendant would have acquired the lot\u00a0 by prescription\u00a0 for a period\u00a0 of ten years, especially when it is proven\u00a0 by the testimony of one of the plaintiffs and by documentary evidence that neither they nor their mothers have been abroad\u00a0 or out of the country, in order to make the required\u00a0 period twenty years.\u00a0 (Art. 1958.)<\/p><p>The claim\u00a0 of prescription having been presented in such form,\u00a0 it must\u00a0 not\u00a0 be understood\u00a0 to be restricted to\u00a0 the prescription\u00a0 of right of action, but must also include prescription of possession.<\/p><p>The \"right to commence action\" having been prescribed, it applies to negative as well as positive prescription, since the right of action lapses as to the person who acquires the possession\u00a0 or ownership as well as to the one who is liable to lose the ownership or possession.<\/p><p>It is true that, under article\u00a0 1965:<\/p><p>\"Among coheirs,\u00a0 co-owners,\u00a0 or proprietors of\u00a0 adjacent estates, the right of action to demand the division of the inheritance, of\u00a0 the\u00a0 thing held in common,\u00a0 or the survey of the\u00a0 adjacent\u00a0 properties\u00a0 does\u00a0 not\u00a0 prescribe;\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 * nevertheless, the imprescriptibility of the action to demand the division\u00a0 of a succession\u00a0 known in\u00a0 Roman Law as <em>famitiss\u00a0 erciscundas<\/em>, can not be invoked when one of the co-heirs\u00a0 has\u00a0 possessed the inheritance as owner and for a period sufficient to acquire it by prescription, because such action necessarily arises from the\u00a0 possession in common or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pro indiviso <\/span>of the inheritance, as laid down by the Supreme Court in a judgment of April\u00a0 15, 1904\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.\u00a0 Moreover, it\u00a0 must be remembered that, as was stated\u00a0 in judgments of the same court of January 15, 1902, and June 22, 1904,\u00a0 the\u00a0 action\u00a0 among\u00a0 coheirs\u00a0 or\u00a0 co-owners\u00a0 to\u00a0 demand partition of the inheritance or division of a fund, to which said article applies, is distinct from the action for recovery involving ownership <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pro solido<\/span> of the same fund, and if the question is one relating to the\u00a0 recovery of inherited property or\u00a0 a\u00a0 part\u00a0 of a\u00a0 common estate,\u00a0 and not of partition, the prohibition in said article<em> is not applicable.<\/em>\"\u00a0 (12 Manresa, Com. on Civil Code, 858.)<\/p><p>For the\u00a0 foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from is reversed, without special finding as to costs.\u00a0\u00a0 So\u00a0 ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

DOMINICOS, OPPONENT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal from\u00a0 a judgment of the Land Court, Hon. Simplicio del Rosario presiding, registering a parcel of land in the name of the petitioner, Alejandro Tecson, against the opposition of the Corporacidn\u00a0 de PP. Dominicos, which claims that the land belongs to it.<br\/><br\/>The appellant\u00a0 in\u00a0 this\u00a0 case\u00a0 makes three assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"First. The\u00a0 pleading in opposition to a registration of land in the Court of Land Registration is sufficient ground in procedural law to raise the question of another action pending between the same parties over the same land.<br\/><br\/>\"Second. A decision in favor of the defendant in an action for the recovery of mere possession\u00a0 is not a decision\u00a0 in relation to the ownership thereof.<br\/><br\/>\"Third. In view of the proofs presented on the trial the overruling of the opposition of the\u00a0 <i>Corporation de PP. Dominicos <\/i>is clearly unjust.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The purpose of the first assignment of error is evidently to raise the question of another action pending between the same parties over the same subject matter.\u00a0 The learned counsel for the\u00a0 appellant asserts that the <i>Corporacion\u00a0 de PP. Dominicos,\u00a0 <\/i>prior to the commencement of the present proceeding, had begun a\u00a0 proceeding in the Court of Land Registration\u00a0 for the purpose of registering the\u00a0 land\u00a0 in dispute in this controversy under Act No. 496, and that the petitioner in this case, Alejandro Tecson, appeared in that proceeding and filed\u00a0 his opposition thereto, thereby joining issue\u00a0 for\u00a0 all the purposes of a trial.\u00a0 This being so, the commencement of the present proceeding by Alejandro Tecson is, according to the contention of counsel for the appellant, the commencement of another action between the same parties over the same subject matter, something which the law does not permit.\u00a0 In reply to this contention it is necessary to say only that this court has held heretofore that the jurisdiction of the Land Court extends no further than the Inscription of the land.described in its final decree mmi the enforcement of that decree, and that, even though the land described in the petition be found by the\u00a0 court,\u00a0 as between the petitioner and the opositor, to be the\u00a0 property of the opponent, such land can not be inscribed in his name, the Land Court having, as we have said, no jurisdiction\u00a0 or power to do\u00a0 so.\u00a0\u00a0 It naturally and necessarily follows that the opponent, if he desires the\u00a0 land\u00a0 of which he claims ownership\u00a0 to be registered\u00a0 in accordance\u00a0 with law, must begin a new proceeding in the Land Court for that purpose, (Foss <i>vs.<\/i> Atkins, 201 Mass., 158; Id., 204 Mass., 337; People. <i>Ex Rel.<\/i>\u00a0 Smith <i>vs.<\/i> Crissman,\u00a0 41 Colo., 450.)\u00a0\u00a0 The result is that two proceedings for the registration of the same land may be pending between the same parties in the same court at the same time; and they may, under order of the court, be\u00a0 tried together.\u00a0 The objection of the appellant upon this ground is, therefore, without merit.<br\/><br\/>The second error assigned is directed to that portion of the decision of the learned court below in which it refers to a decision\u00a0 of the Hon.\u00a0 Estanislao Yusay, judge of the Court\u00a0 of First Instance of\u00a0 Rizal, rendered in\u00a0 an action brought by the <i>Corporation de PP. Dominicos <\/i>against several defendants, among\u00a0 them Alejandro\u00a0 Tecson,\u00a0 the petitioner in\u00a0 the\u00a0 case at bar, for\u00a0 the purpose\u00a0 of recovering possession\u00a0 of certain parcels of land,\u00a0 among\u00a0 them the land now in controversy, which was at that time occupied and claimed by said Alejandro Tecson as owner.\u00a0\u00a0 In his decision the learned court below in the action at bar referred to that decision\u00a0 and attached to it\u00a0 some importance.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 true that the\u00a0 action appears\u00a0 to have been for the\u00a0 recovery of possession\u00a0 merely, but the right to possession asserted\u00a0 by the plaintiff in that case was\u00a0 founded\u00a0 upon its claim of ownership\u00a0 of the Hacienda de Navotas, of which it claimed the land occupied by Alejandro Tecson was a part.\u00a0 The plaintiff\u00a0 in that\u00a0 case attempted to\u00a0 show,\u00a0 and produced witnesses for that purpose, that Alejandro\u00a0 Tecson was a tenant of the Hacienda de Navotas, owned by the plaintiff, and that having refused to pay rent, his eviction therefrom was sought.\u00a0 The court\u00a0 in that case found in favor of the defendant Alejandro Tecson and against the plaintiff.\u00a0 The only thing we can gather from that decision is that plaintiff's right to possession was not superior to that of the defendant.\u00a0 The trial court in\u00a0 the case at bar did not rest its\u00a0 conclusion upon the\u00a0 decision in that case\u00a0 but used it rather in support of his finding that the petitioner, Alejandro Tecson, had occupied the\u00a0 land in question\u00a0 adversely for many years and was its owner by virtue of prescription. This was an entirely proper use of that decision, it tending to demonstrate that even at and before the time of its rendition Tecson was occupying the land under a right superior to the <i>Corporacion de PP. Dominicoa<\/i> and probably under claim of ownership.<br\/><br\/>As to the third error assigned, it presents simply a question of fact.\u00a0 We have examined the\u00a0 cause thoroughly and read carefully the evidence produced on the trial.\u00a0 After a thorough consideration of the whole case, we are unable to say that the conclusions of the learned trial court upon the facts are against the\u00a0 fair preponderance of the evidence adduced.\u00a0\u00a0 The trial\u00a0 court\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 opinion\u00a0 upon\u00a0 which its judgment in favor of\u00a0 the petitioner\u00a0 is founded\u00a0 went into the\u00a0 facts in detail.\u00a0 He analyzed the testimony carefully and gave his reasons for the decision which he made.\u00a0 So thoroughly and satisfactorily did he do this\u00a0 that we do not feel called upon to\u00a0 go into a detailed discussion\u00a0 of the evidence here.\u00a0 As\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 facts, we\u00a0 base\u00a0 our conclusions upon those stated in that opinion.<br\/><br\/>The assignments of error and the arguments made thereupon presenting no sufficient reason for the\u00a0 reversal of the judgment of the court below,\u00a0 that judgment is hereby affirmed, without special\u00a0 finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Accepting, for the\u00a0 purposes of the\u00a0 present demurrer, the facts set forth in the present complaint, and supposing there- fore,\u00a0 as it may well be supposed,\u00a0 that the defendant\u00a0 did commit some defalcation\u00a0 of the funds which\u00a0 were\u00a0 in his keeping, the\u00a0 tendency of the said law would be forcibly to oblige the\u00a0 defendant to testify to facts which might give rise to the filing of an information against him\u00a0 for malversation.\u00a0 In view of the constitutional guaranties, this court finds no more reason for a law which compels public officers to give information in writing on facts that might originate a complaint for\u00a0 malversation, than that which could exist in favor of a law compelling a person who kills another to give a written account to the prosecution of all the facts connected with the\u00a0 victim's death.\u00a0\u00a0 The mere fact that a defendant is a public officer should not deprive him of the constitutional rights guaranteed to all by the fundamental laws.<br\/><br\/>\"The demurrer is sustained, and the\u00a0 defect in the complaint, being one affecting its essentiality and not correctible by amendment, the court orders the\u00a0 final dismissal of the case and the annulment of the bond\u00a0 given in favor of the defendant.\"<\/blockquote>From this order the prosecution appealed\u00a0 and the case has been raised to this court for the decision of the appeal. <br\/><br\/>Section 1 of Act No. 1740, a violation of which is charged against the defendant, literally provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any bonded officer or employee of the Insular Government, or of any provincial or municipal government, or of the city of Manila, and any other person who, having charge, by reason of his office or employment,\u00a0 of Insular, provincial, or municipal funds or property, or of funds\u00a0 or property of the city of Manila, or of trust or other funds by law required to be kept or deposited by or with such officer, employee,\u00a0 or other person, or by or with any\u00a0 public office, treasury,\u00a0 or other\u00a0 depositary, fails or\u00a0 refuses to account for the same, or makes personal use of such funds or property, or of any part thereof, or abstracts or misappropriates the same or any part thereof, or is guilty of any malversation with reference to such funds or property, or through\u00a0 his abandonment, fault, or negligence permits any other person to abstract, misappropriate, or make personal use of the same, shall,\u00a0 upon conviction, be punished by imprisonment for not less than two months nor more than ten years and, in the discretion of the court, by a fine of not more than the amount of Such funds and the value of such property.\"<\/blockquote>It is alleged that\u00a0 these provisions are\u00a0 contrary to\u00a0 section 5 of the Act of Congress of July\u00a0 1, 1902, which prescribes that \"no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\" since\u00a0 it tends, according to the trial court, forcibly to oblige the defendant to\u00a0 testify to facts which might give rise to the filing of an information against him\u00a0 for malversation.\u00a0 The\u00a0 lower court is under the impression, apparently, that\u00a0 any public officer\u00a0 who fails or refuses to account,\u00a0 when\u00a0 duly required to do so, for the funds or property of which he may have charge, by reason of his employment, is unquestionably guilty of malversation, and\u00a0 that it is\u00a0 under this\u00a0 construction that the law punishes the said act; for, were it not so, if the refusal to render an account of the funds did not necessarily imply, in the mind of the court, a defalcation or misappropriation of such funds, then there would be no basis or foundation for the statement that the imposition of a penalty for such a refusal is for the purpose of obliging or tends to oblige an officer to testify to facts which may give rise to a complaint against him for the crime of malversation.\u00a0 Such an opinion does not appear to us\u00a0 to be correct. True it is that the unjustified refusal to render an account may produce a suspicion\u00a0 that there are at least irregularities\u00a0 in the officer's bookkeeping, but neither is this in itself conclusive proof of misappropriation, nor does the law in imposing punishment in any wise take into account the more or less correct condition of the funds which may be in his charge.\u00a0 The law makes the mere fact of that refusal\u00a0 a crime and punishes it as such, in absolute distinction from the other fact, entirely immaterial to the case, as to whether or not the funds in the safe\u00a0 entrusted to the officer are intact.\u00a0 So true is this .that, although such funds are found to be intact and the official having them\u00a0 in\u00a0 charge\u00a0 is found not to\u00a0 have committed the\u00a0 smallest or most\u00a0 insignificant defalcation, still he would\u00a0 not be exempt from\u00a0 the\u00a0 criminal liability established\u00a0 by\u00a0 law\u00a0 if\u00a0 he\u00a0 refused\u00a0 or failed to render an account of said funds on\u00a0 being requested to do so by\u00a0 competent authority.\u00a0\u00a0 The reason for this is that Act No. 1740, in so far as its provisions bearing on this point are concerned, does not so much contemplate the possibility of malversation as the need of enforcing by a penal provision the performance of the duty incumbent upon every public employee who handles government funds, as well as every depositary or administrator of another's property, to render on account of all he receives or has in his\u00a0 charge by reason of his employment.\u00a0 Moreover, it may be said, looking at the matter from another point of view, that the design of the Act before mentioned was to impart stability to the good order and discipline\u00a0 which should\u00a0 prevail in the\u00a0 organization and workings of the\u00a0 public service by punishing the\u00a0 employee who should disobey an order or a demand, lawfully made by a\u00a0 competent officer, for the\u00a0 rendition of\u00a0 accounts - a disobedience which\u00a0 it would be absurd to\u00a0 suppose\u00a0 could\u00a0 be supported\u00a0 and protected, directly or indirectly, by\u00a0 any of the fundamental laws of the Philippines - in\u00a0 the same manner that it would be absurd also to suppose that our constitution protects or could protect,\u00a0 under\u00a0 the mantle\u00a0 of impunity, the\u00a0 public officer who should\u00a0 refuse to\u00a0 comply with\u00a0 a\u00a0 duty that was inherent in the\u00a0 very nature of his office, to render an account of the funds or property received by him\u00a0 for deposit or administration.\u00a0 And\u00a0 if this is true, as it undoubtedly is, then it can in no wise be said that the law which punishes those acts is contrary to section 5\u00a0 of the Philippine Bill, or\u00a0 is in any other\u00a0 respect anti-constitutional.<br\/><br\/>The doctrine laid down\u00a0 by this court in the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Navarro (3 Phil. Rep., 143),\u00a0 cited in the order appealed from, has no application to the present case. In that case the majority of this court held that article 483 of the Penal Code had been repealed by the Philippine Bill, because in\u00a0 their opinion, <i> it imposed upon the\u00a0 accused the necessity of testifying as a witness in his own defense,<\/i> which certainly may not be said of Act No. 1740 in the part thereof alleged to have been violated by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Sections\u00a0 57 and 59 of General Orders, No. 58, are also cited in the order appealed from, as being contrary to the Act referred to.\u00a0 The first of these sections prescribes that a defendant in a criminal action shall be presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proyed; and the second, that the burden of proof of guilt shall be upon the prosecution. As it is seen, these provisions establish rules of procedure, while Act No.\u00a0 1740, in the part thereof under review, is restricted solely to defining and punishing as a crime the act of refusal of a public employee to render an account of the funds and\u00a0 property in\u00a0 his charge, when duly required to do so by a competent.officer; for which reason there does not exist, nor can there exist, any opposition or antagonism between the aforesaid legal\u00a0 provisions, because they treat of entirely different matters which have no points of contact between\u00a0 them.\u00a0 It is obvious that the prosecution must prove, else the accused could not be convicted of the said crime, that the latter was required to render an account by a competent officer, and that he then refused to do so, and when such proof has been\u00a0 produced the provisions of the before-cited sections of General Orders, No.\u00a0 58, that relate to the prosecution's\u00a0 proving the defendant's guilt in order to obtain the conviction\u00a0 of the\u00a0 latter at trial, have been complied with.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing, the conclusion is drawn that, in our opinion, the act charged\u00a0 against the defendant consisting, according to\u00a0 the complaint, in his having refused or failed to render an account of the funds which he had under his charge, and this notwithstanding his having been required to do so by an officer authorized by law for such purpose, does not constitute, technically speaking, the crime of malversation, though penalized in the same law (Act No. 1740) which punishes this crime, for malversation consists, properly, in the abstraction of the funds or in their application to improper uses, either by the officer himself in charge thereof or by any other person voluntarily permitted by him, through his negligence\u00a0 or\u00a0 abandonment, to abstract or misappropriate the same.\u00a0\u00a0 And although in the\u00a0 complaint the act charged is specified as a crime of malversation, this circumstance does not alter and can not alter the true legal nature of the said\u00a0 act, neither can it\u00a0 affect the judgment to be rendered in due season and\u00a0 in which the crime described in the complaint must be denominated in accordance with the law, and\u00a0 not in accordance with the designation thereof given by the accused or the complainant.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Treyes, 14 Phil. Rep., 1270; and U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Gellada, 15 Phil. Rep., 120.)<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, and\u00a0 with a reversal of the order appealed from, the demurrer filed\u00a0 against\u00a0 the\u00a0 complaint is\u00a0 overruled, and it\u00a0 is\u00a0 directed that the\u00a0 case be remanded to the court of\u00a0 its origin\u00a0 in order that it may proceed to the proper trial thereof in accordance with law,<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

Act\u00a0 1740\u00a0 and the Acts hereinafter\u00a0 referred to make that distinction clearly and fully.\u00a0 There may be a vast\u00a0 legal gulf between\u00a0 a refusal to give an account\u00a0 of official acts and\u00a0 a refusal to account for funds.\u00a0\u00a0 In the one case the incumbent may be simply a disobedient official.\u00a0\u00a0 In the other, he\u00a0 may be a thief.\u00a0 In the one case the official may turn over\u00a0 every penny of the funds in his hands, but, through pique, spite, ill will, or fancied illtreatment, refuse to render a statement of his receipts and disbursements, i. e.,\u00a0 render an account of his official acts.\u00a0 In such case he is not\u00a0 an embezzler.\u00a0 He is simply, a disobedient, but entirely honest, official.\u00a0 In the other case, refusing or failing to account for, that is,\u00a0 produce, the fund\u00a0 in his\u00a0 hands, he becomes, <i>prima facie,<\/i> an embezzler.<br\/><br\/>Now, the court holds that Act 1740, in addition to creating the crime of embezzlement, makes the mere failure or refusal to render\u00a0 an account of official acts a crime, and punishes it in the same manner and to\u00a0 the same extent as embezzlement. To put it differently:\u00a0 The court holds that even though the offending official voluntarily produce and turn over every penny belonging to the Government,\u00a0 he is,\u00a0 nevertheless, guilty of a crime under Act No.\u00a0 1740 if he refuse to render an account of his official acts; that is, if he refuse to\u00a0 give to the examining officer a statement of the receipts, disbursements, etc., of his office, with proper receipts and vouchers. To illustrate what the court holds in the prevailing opinion: A.\u00a0 is a provincial treasurer.\u00a0 The district auditor goes to A.'s office and demands that he render an account of his official acts performed during\u00a0 the\u00a0 preceding\u00a0 month.\u00a0\u00a0 A. produces and turns over to the district auditor every centavo of the money belonging to the\u00a0 Government.\u00a0 Not a penny is missing or withheld.\u00a0 But for some\u00a0 reason he refuses to give the district auditor a statement of his official acts,\u00a0 that is, to render an account.\u00a0\u00a0 Under these facts the court holds that A. is guilty under Act\u00a0 1740, not of embezzlement, but of the crime of refusing to give the <i>district auditor<\/i> a statement of his account, and that he is punishable, in the discretion of the court, by\u00a0 ten\u00a0 years' imprisonment, a fine,\u00a0 and <i>perpetual disqualification<\/i> to hold public\u00a0 office or employment of\u00a0 any\u00a0 kind in the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 In other words although he voluntarily turn over every dollar of the Government's money and is therefore guilty of nothing more than disobedience, he\u00a0 is nevertheless\u00a0 to\u00a0 be treated under\u00a0 Act 1740 as an embezzler and a thief and to be given exactly the same punishment as one\u00a0 who not only refuses to give\u00a0 a statement of his accounts but also maliciously and criminally steals and embezzles\u00a0 every penny\u00a0 of the Government's money.<br\/><br\/>With this conclusion of the court I wholly disagree.\u00a0 In my judgment Act 1740 defines and punishes embezzlement and nothing else.\u00a0 I give three reasons\u00a0 to support my judgment:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>The plain wording of the Act renders the conclusions of the court legally impossible.\u00a0 The mere reading of the Act shows to\u00a0 my mind at once and conclusively that\u00a0 the Legislature never intended by that Act to define and punish any crime but embezzlement.\u00a0 It follows:<br\/><\/li><\/ol><blockquote>\"Section 1. Any bonded officer or employee of the Insular Government, or of any provincial or municipal government, or of the city of Manila, and any other person who, having\u00a0 charge,\u00a0 by reason of his office or employment, of Insular, provincial, or municipal funds or property, or of funds or property of the city of Manila, or of trust or other funds by\u00a0 law required\u00a0 to be kept or deposited by\u00a0 or with such officer, employee, or other\u00a0 person, or by or with any public office, treasury, or other depositary, fails or refuses to account for the same, or makes personal use of such funds or property, or of any part thereof, or abstracts or misappropriates the same, or any part thereof, or is guilty of any malversation with reference to such funds or property, or through his abandonment, fault,\u00a0 or negligence permits any other person to abstract, misappropriate, or make personal use\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 same, shall, upon conviction, be punished by imprisonment for not less than two months nor more than ten years and, in the discretion of the\u00a0 court, by a fine of not more than the amount of such funds\u00a0 and the value of such property.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 2. In all prosecutions for violations of the preceding section, the absence of any of the public funds\u00a0 or property of which any person\u00a0 described in said section\u00a0 has charge, and\u00a0 any failure or inability of such person to produce all the funds and property properly in his charge on the demand of any officer authorized to examine or inspect such person, office, treasury,\u00a0 or depositary shall be deemed to be prima facie evidence\u00a0 that such\u00a0 missing funds or\u00a0 property\u00a0 have been put to personal uses or used for personal ends by such person within the meaning of the preceding section.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 3. Every person convicted of a violation\u00a0 of\u00a0 this Act shall ipso facto be forever disqualified from holding any public office or employment of any nature whatever within the Philippine Islands.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is to me clear that section 1\u00a0 provides punishment only for that official who, having Government funds or property, \"fails or refuses to <i>account for the same,<\/i>\" and not for him who merely fails or refuses to <i>render a statement <\/i>of receipts and disbursements or to give\u00a0 a history of his <i>official acts.<\/i> This section, to my mind, clearly requires\u00a0 the production of the<i> money itself,<\/i> and not alone a statement of official acts. The demand is, \"Produce the money,\" not, \"Render me a statement of your accounts or a history of your acts,\" except, possibly, in so far as the rendering of the account is neces- sary to account for the funds. This\u00a0 section\u00a0 nowhere refers to a failure or refusal to render an account, solely as such, but only to a failure or refusal to account for, to produce and turn over.\u00a0 This assertion is fully\u00a0 confirmed by the provisions of the second section of the Act. This section, in my judgment, precludes the possibility of holding upon logical grounds that the Act refers to any crime other than embezzlement.\u00a0 It says:<br\/><blockquote>\"In all prosecutions for violations of the preceding section, the absence of any of the public <i>funds or property <\/i>of which any person described\u00a0 in\u00a0 said\u00a0 section has charge,\u00a0 and\u00a0 any failure or inability of such person to produce all the funds and property\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 shall\u00a0 be deemed to\u00a0 be prima facie evidence that such missing funds or property have been put to personal uses\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The words uall prosecutions for violations of the preceding section\"\u00a0 must be given their usual and ordinary meaning. They mean all prosecutions\u00a0 under section 1, whether that section creates one crime or twenty.\u00a0\u00a0 No crime defined in that section\u00a0 can escape the all-embracing reach of these words.\u00a0\u00a0 Now,\u00a0 section\u00a0 2 is laying down rules, in the form of presumptions, as to the effect of certain evidence, which rules or presumptions are applied to all violations of section 1.\u00a0 We should expect, therefore, that such rules would be made sufficiently broad and\u00a0 comprehensive to touch\u00a0 every crime defined in section 1, whether one or twenty.\u00a0 If\u00a0 one seeks to\u00a0 make certain conditions applicable to all members of a class, we naturally expect him to do so.\u00a0 If in\u00a0 doing so he use language which makes those conditions applicable to only a part\u00a0 of that class,\u00a0 one of two assumptions is necessary; either he did not know the language he was using or he made a\u00a0 very serious blunder\u00a0 in its use.\u00a0 Now, the Legislature, by section 2, sought to make certain rules relat- ing to the weight and effect of evidence, i. e., presumptions, applicable to all violations of section\u00a0 1.\u00a0 If the Legislature, intending to make\u00a0 such\u00a0 rules applicable to\u00a0 all violations of section 1, uses language which makes such rules applicable to cnly\u00a0 a part\u00a0 of said violations, what must we necessarily conclude ?\u00a0 We must conclude that the Legislature either, did not know the English language or else it made a very serious blunder in its use.\u00a0\u00a0 Let us see what the Legislature said in making such rules applicable to\u00a0 all violations of section 1. As\u00a0 we have already observed, section 2 provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"In all prosecutions for violations of the preceding section [section 1] <i>the absence of any of the public funds or property<\/i> of which any person described in said section <i>has charge, and any failure or inability of such person to produce\u00a0 all the funds or property, <\/i>shall be deemed to be prima facie evidence that such <i>missing funds or property <\/i>have been put to personal uses\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 within the meaning of the preceding section.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We notice, then, first, that this section refers exclusively to the <i>absence of funds or property. <\/i>\u00a0 There is not one word about a statement of account or of the rendition\u00a0 of a statement of official acts or of the\u00a0 rendition of\u00a0 any account, purely\u00a0 as\u00a0 such.\u00a0\u00a0 There is nothing\u00a0 whatever except the requirement to<i> produce funds or property<\/i>. \"Produce the funds,\" is the order, not, \"Give me an itemized statement of your account.\"\u00a0\u00a0 But this section applies by express language. to every violation of section 1, whatever may be the number of the crimes\u00a0 it creates.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, if section 2 includes every violation of section 1, and section 2 refers exclusively to missing\u00a0 funds or property, then it would be natural to assume\u00a0 that section 1 must refer exclusively to\u00a0 the crime involved in a failure or refusal to\u00a0 <i>produce funds or property,<\/i> and not to a\u00a0 failure or refusal\u00a0 to <i>\"render an account of official acts,<\/i>\" as such.\u00a0 We must either make this assumption or we must\u00a0 say that the\u00a0 Legislature did\u00a0 not know language or that it committed a blunder in its use.\u00a0 As we have before\u00a0 intimated, it would certainly be going far to hold that the Legislature\u00a0 intended to apply certain\u00a0 rules relative to the weight and effect of evidence to <i>all<\/i> violations of section 1\u00a0 and then used language which really applied such rules to a\u00a0 part of such violations <i>only<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0 But this assumption must be made if the court is right in the decision of this case.\u00a0\u00a0 To repeat: The court asserts that section 1 creates two crimes: One, embezzlement, and the other, the failure or refusal to\u00a0 render an account of official acts,\u00a0 as such.\u00a0 But, as is seen, it is quite impossible for the\u00a0 rules laid down in section 2 to have any application whatever to the alleged crime of a failure or refusal to render an account, as that phrase\u00a0 is used in\u00a0 the prevailing\u00a0 opinion.\u00a0 Nevertheless, section 2, by express words, says that its provisions shall apply to <i>all<\/i> violations of\u00a0 section 1.\u00a0 In order\u00a0 that sections\u00a0 1 and\u00a0 2 shall\u00a0 be harmonious rather\u00a0 than\u00a0 contradictory, it must be held that section 1\u00a0 creates only <i>one<\/i> crime, embezzlement.\u00a0 Certainly\u00a0 section 2 refers to\u00a0 only one\u00a0 crime and yet\u00a0 it says expressly that it includes <i>every<\/i> crime created by section 1.\u00a0 Either section 1 creates\u00a0 only one\u00a0 crime or section 2 does not\u00a0 do what\u00a0 it says it\u00a0 does, namely\u00a0 apply to every\u00a0 crime named in\u00a0 section\u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0 The conclusion necessarily is that, by the plain\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 of the Act, only one crime is defined and punished therein. The clear wording of section\u00a0 1 and, if possible, the\u00a0 still clearer wording of section 2 demonstrate that the Legislature intended to define and\u00a0 punish\u00a0 the\u00a0 <i>malversation\u00a0 of public funds,<\/i> whether committed\u00a0 by actual conversion, by failure,\u00a0 inability or refusal to produce, or by negligence. If the official <i>produces the funds<\/i> he has committed no crime under that Act, no matter how obstreperous,\u00a0 disobedient and\u00a0 insolent\u00a0 he may\u00a0 be to his\u00a0 superiors.\u00a0\u00a0 A failure or refusal to render a statement of his\u00a0 accounts is not a crime under that Act.\u00a0 It may be <i>evidence<\/i> which,\u00a0 taken with other evidence, <i> tends\u00a0 to prove the\u00a0 crime of embezzlement <\/i>\u00a0 (see Act No. 749); but it is not itself a crime under that Act.<br\/><ol start=\"2\"><li>The title of the Act [No. 1740] shows that the construction of the court in the prevailing opinion can not stand.<br\/><\/li><\/ol>The title is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"An Act providing for the punishment of public officers and employees who fail or refuse to <i>account for public funds or property<\/i> or\u00a0 who make personal use of such funds or property, or\u00a0 any part thereof, or who misappropriate the same, or any part thereof, or who are guilty of any mal- versation with reference to such funds or property, or who through abandonment, fault, or negligence permit any other person to abstract, misappropriate,\u00a0 or make personal use of the same.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It would be difficult for general language\u00a0 to express more clearly the purpose of\u00a0 an Act.\u00a0 It, in every line and word, refers exclusively to public <i>funds or property.<\/i>\u00a0 It would seem to be impossible to mistake the meaning.\u00a0\u00a0 Its purpose is to punish the officer\u00a0 or employee who (1) fails or refuses to <i>account for<\/i>.\u00a0 public funds (not <i>render\u00a0 an account<\/i> of receipts and\u00a0 disbursements, i. e., give a history of\u00a0 official acts, strictly\u00a0 as such);\u00a0 (2) makes personal use of public <i>funds<\/i>; (3) actually misappropriates\u00a0 public <i>funds;<\/i>\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 is guilty of any malversation of public<i> funds<\/i>; (5) by neglect permits others to misappropriate public <i>funds.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 Every word is directed toward the preservation of the <i>funds<\/i> of the State. Every line is drawn to apprehend and punish the official who does something with public <i>funds<\/i> to deal with a situation where funds are missing, as a <i>known fact<\/i>, legally proved.<br\/><br\/>I desire here to call\u00a0 attention to the error into which the court falls by confusing at a certain point in its decision the expressions \"to render an account of official acts\" and \"to account for funds,\" after having made the difference in the meaning of these two expressions\u00a0 the whole basis of\u00a0 its claim that Act 1740 creates two crimes instead of one.\u00a0 It will be remembered, that the opinion\u00a0 of the court clearly holds that an official may be guilty of the crime of refusing to \"render an account\" under that Act even though he voluntarily produce and turn over, that is,\u00a0 \"account for,\" all the funds belonging to the Government.\u00a0\u00a0 This distinction between the meaning of the two expressions is necessarily the vital element in the holding that there are two crimes instead of one created by the Act.\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless,\u00a0 the\u00a0 only source from which the court obtains any authority whatever for its holding that the Act makes a neglect or refusal to \"render an account\" a crime\u00a0 is from the expression found in the title and in section 1 of the Act, \"who fail or\u00a0 refuse to <i>account for public funds.<\/i>\"\u00a0 In other words, the court holds that Act 1740 creates two crimes, one \"a failure or refusal to <i>render an account<\/i>,\" and\u00a0 the other, \"a failure or refusal <i>to account for funds,<\/i>\" but <i>finds\u00a0 the creation of both crimes in exactly\u00a0 the\u00a0 same words,<\/i> namely,\u00a0 \"who fail or\u00a0 refuse to <i>account for funds.\"<\/i>\u00a0 To put it differently, and, I hope, more clearly:\u00a0 I ask the court, \"In what words of the Act do you find your authority for saying that it creates the crime of failing to render an account, although every penny of the funds is produced and accounted for?\"\u00a0 The reply of the court necessarily is, \"We find that authority in the phrase 'any officer or employee\u00a0 who\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 having charge of funds or\u00a0 property\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 fails or refuses to <i>account for the\u00a0 same.<\/i>'\"\u00a0 I then\u00a0 ask the court, \"In what words of the Act do you find your authority for holding that it creates the crime of embezzlement?\"\u00a0\u00a0 The reply of the court necessarily is, \"We find that authority <i>in the same phrase.\"<\/i>\u00a0 The decision fails to explain how\u00a0 two crimes, entirely different in nature, can be drawn\u00a0 from exactly the same words.\u00a0 It fails to\u00a0 demonstrate how it is possible to say that\u00a0 \"to account for funds\" are the creative words in the crime of embezzlement, and,in the same breath, say that they are also the creative words in the crime of \"refusal to <i>render an\u00a0 account.\"<\/i>\u00a0 The\u00a0 two\u00a0 crimes are entirely\u00a0 different\u00a0 in nature.\u00a0 In the latter crime the integrity of the funds may not be at all in question.\u00a0 In the other it always is.\u00a0 To render an account does not necessarily mean to produce the funds.\u00a0\u00a0 To account for funds requires their production, or its equivalent.\u00a0\u00a0 The expression \"account for fun'ds\" may, at times, include\u00a0 \"render an account,\" but it may mean something different or additional.\u00a0 A thief may be able to <i>render an account,<\/i> as that phrase is used in the prevailing opinion, but he can not <i>account for<\/i>.\u00a0 An official\u00a0 can <i>render an account<\/i>, and a correct one, although he may have stolen every dollar in his charge.\u00a0 One who can account for can always render an account of.\u00a0 But one who can render <i>an account of <\/i>can not always <i>account for<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0 The only phrase in all the Act which lends any color whatever to the claim of the court that the Act makes a failure or refusal to render an account a crime is the phrase to which I have already so many times referred, \"any person who having charge\u00a0 of public funds or property\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 * <i>fails or refuses to\u00a0 account for the same.\"<\/i>\u00a0 How\u00a0 can the same phrase mean two things which may not bear the slightest relation to each\u00a0 other?\u00a0 failure or refusal to render an account is never\u00a0 embezzlement.\u00a0 It may be competent evidence on\u00a0 a trial for embezzlement, but it is not embezzlement itself.\u00a0 But the statute expressly makes a failure or refusal or inability to account for,\u00a0 that is, produce, public funds, prima facie embezzlement.\u00a0\u00a0 Such failure, refusal, or inability to produce is not only <i>evidence of<\/i> embezzlement; it\u00a0 is embezzlement, <i>prima facie<\/i>, if the funds are actually missing.\u00a0\u00a0 So that,\u00a0 the \"failure or refusal to render an account,\" if made a crime at all by the Act, must be also embezzlement, inasmuch as that crime is, as we have seen, defined by and included in the phrase \"fails or refuses to account for\u00a0 public funds,\" which \"failure or refusal to account for public funds\" is embezzlement, when it is shown that the\u00a0 funds are actually missing from\u00a0 the\u00a0 depository specified by law.<br\/><br\/>Further as to the meaning of the phrase \"account for:\"<br\/><br\/>A contract provided that, defendant, in consideration of having purchased of\u00a0 plaintiff certain shares of stock\u00a0 in a bank and having received plaintiff's obligation therefor and power of attorney to transfer the same, promised and agreed <i>to account<\/i> to the plaintiff for one-half the proceeds or avails of a certain mortgage held by the bank\u00a0 on certain\u00a0 real estate.\u00a0 The words in the contract, \"to account for,\" were construed\u00a0 by the\u00a0 Supreme Court of Massachusetts as importing an obligation to pay plaintiff one-half of the proceeds or avails of the mortgage which came to defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 (Cushman <i>vs<\/i>. Richards, 100 Mass., 232.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of the\u00a0 Supervisors of the Town of Franklin <i>vs<\/i>. Kirby (25 Wis., 498) the action was against Kirby as principal\u00a0 and the other two defendants as\u00a0 sureties\u00a0 upon a bond given by Kirby as treasurer of said town of Franklin. The condition of the bond was that Kirby should faithfully discharge the duties of his office \"and faithfully and truly <i>account for<\/i>\u00a0 and pay\u00a0 over, according to law, all\u00a0 money\" which\u00a0 should come into his hands as such treasurer.\u00a0 The complaint averred that Kirby, in\u00a0 pursuance\u00a0 of\u00a0 his duties as such treasurer, collected the\u00a0 tax of said town\u00a0 for the year 1866, amounting to $3,588.31, and had not accounted for or paid\u00a0 over, as\u00a0 required by law to do, the\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of $3,588.31, but had only accounted for and paid over the sum of $3,084.84, and that there remained\u00a0 in the hands of said Kirby, received by him by virtue of said office, unaccounted for and not paid over\u00a0 as required by law, the\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of $503.77; and that he \"refused and neglected to pay over or account for said sum\u00a0 of $503.77, although often required to do so.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The appeal was from the\u00a0 order overruling the demurrer to the complaint.\u00a0 Counsel for respondent argued that the obligation to account for was\u00a0 wholly separate and distinct from the obligation to pay over and that the complaint was sufficient because, even though it failed to allege a neglect or\u00a0 refusal to pay over, it did\u00a0 allege a\u00a0 refusal to account for.\u00a0 In discussing the case the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The respondent's counsel attempts to sustain the complaint by dividing the clause of the statute, requiring him to account for and pay over moneys coming to his hands, into two distinct grounds\u00a0 of\u00a0 liability.\u00a0 But this construction can not prevail.\u00a0\u00a0 He\u00a0 is required to account merely as a preliminary to paying over.. The latter is the essential thing.\u00a0 And\u00a0 the\u00a0 words 'to account for and pay over' are used in the\u00a0 section fixing the condition of\u00a0 the treasurer's bond,\u00a0 to describe his\u00a0 duty in respect to paying properly at all times, and to ascertaining and paying over whatever balance may be in his hands whenever called upon lawfully by any person entitled to receive it.\u00a0 So long as there is no default in paying-over, it was not the design of that clause to create a distinct ground of action for not accounting;\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case of The State <i>ex rel<\/i>. McKown<i> vs. <\/i>Williams (77 Mo., 463), the question before the court was the construction of the clause in a bond requiring the obligor to \"well and truly <i>account for<\/i>\" certain moneys.\u00a0 The court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The learned counsel for appellants suggest that when the guardian charged himself with the wards' money obtained in Tennessee,\u00a0 in his\u00a0 annual settlements, that was a compliance\u00a0 with the conditions\u00a0 of the bond;\u00a0 the\u00a0 breach assigned in the petition being a failure, etc., 'to account for' this money.\u00a0 This is not all that is embraced in this term 'account for.' It is a condition not satisfied short of paying over the trust fund to the <i>cestui que trust.<\/i>\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The same\u00a0 holding\u00a0 was\u00a0 made in the similar case of The State <i>ex rel<\/i>. Mount <i>vs<\/i>. Steele (21 Ind., 207), where the court said,\u00a0 defining the signification of the expression\u00a0 \"account for\" found in a guardian's bond:<br\/><blockquote>\"This condition requires not only the accounting for the moneys, but their payment according to law.\u00a0\u00a0 Their\u00a0 payment according to law signifies\u00a0 payment to the\u00a0 ward,\u00a0 or other persons entitled\u00a0 to receive the same.\u00a0\u00a0 To\u00a0 be sure, when the guardian\u00a0 reports the\u00a0 sale of real\u00a0 estate, he is required to produce the proceeds of the sale and the notes, etc., given to secure the purchase money.\u00a0 (2 R.

The answer to this question is in itself a complete answer to the majority opinion in the case.\u00a0\u00a0 And when we consider, further, that, if Act 1740 does what the court holds it does, then there are two laws punishing\u00a0 the same offense and <i>punishing it altogether differently, <\/i>the impossibility of sustaining the theory of the court is more apparent.\u00a0 Act 749 punishes a failure or refusal to\u00a0 render an\u00a0 account\u00a0 with a fine only not exceeding two thousand dollars.\u00a0 There is no minimum.\u00a0 It may be no more than one centavo.\u00a0\u00a0 No imprisonment\u00a0 whatever can be imposed,\u00a0 except subsidiary. There is no accompanying disqualification to\u00a0 hold office or employment.\u00a0\u00a0 On the other\u00a0 hand, if Act 1740 makes such failure or refusal\u00a0 a\u00a0 crime,\u00a0 such crime\u00a0 under that Act is punishable by imprisonment of not\u00a0 less than two months or more than ten years, and, in the discretion of the court, by a fine of not more than\u00a0 the value of the\u00a0 property embezzled.\u00a0 Moreover, the convict shall be forever disqualified \"from holding\u00a0 any\u00a0 public\u00a0 office\u00a0 or employment of any nature whatever within the Philippine Islands.\"\u00a0 Thus, if the court is right in its opinion, we have two laws punishing the same act, one law punishing it as it ought to be punished, that is, according to its nature and results, by a fine merely, and the\u00a0 other punishing it\u00a0 in\u00a0 a\u00a0 manner frightfully disproportionate\u00a0 to the\u00a0 nature\u00a0 of\u00a0 the crime and its effects. The very nature of the\u00a0 punishment imposed by Act 1740 demonstrates,\u00a0 of <i>necessity, <\/i>that it was never\u00a0 intended to include among the offenses defined\u00a0 and punished thereby the mere failure or refusal to render an account of official acts.\u00a0\u00a0 It is an elementary principle\u00a0 of legislation\u00a0 that the same offense shall not be dealt with under two different laws or punishable in two different\u00a0 ways.\u00a0\u00a0 The Legislature is never deemed\u00a0 to have expressed two widely different opinions on the gravity and punishability of the same act.\u00a0 This court,\u00a0 by the prevailing\u00a0 opinion, holds that the Philippine Commission has expressed,\u00a0 by two different laws, both of which\u00a0 are\u00a0 still\u00a0 in force,\u00a0 two different opinions\u00a0 as to the nature and gravity\u00a0 of the offense\u00a0 involved in failing or refusing to\u00a0 render an account, saying in one opinion that the offense is\u00a0 so mild in its nature and so insignificant in its results that a mere fine is\u00a0 punishment entirely adequate, and in the other that such offense\u00a0 is so grave in its nature and so destructive in\u00a0 its\u00a0 results\u00a0 that it ought to be classed among the highest of\u00a0 the crimes against property, and that the person committing it ought to\u00a0 be placed among thieves and\u00a0 embezzlers, and\u00a0 punished,\u00a0 in proper\u00a0 cases,\u00a0 with ten years in state prison, a fine, and with perpetual\u00a0 disqualification to hold public office or employment of any kind.\u00a0\u00a0 I can not give my consent to such\u00a0 a holding.\u00a0 I can not believe that the Philippine Commission intended\u00a0 that an official, who scrupulously produced and turned over to\u00a0 the Government every centavo belonging to it, but who, by reason of pique or obstreperousness, refused to give\u00a0 a history of his official\u00a0 acts, i.\u00a0 e., <i>render<\/i>\u00a0 an account to his superior, should be classed among thieves and embezzlers and should\u00a0 be punished in the same\u00a0 way and with the\u00a0 same results to his subsequent life as the one who not only refused to render an account but also maliciously\u00a0 and criminally robbed the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Government of every peso intrusted to his care.\u00a0\u00a0 I do not believe that the Philippine. Commission expressed two radically\u00a0 different\u00a0 opinions as to the nature of the same act. I do\u00a0 not believe that\u00a0 it provided\u00a0 two radically different punishments for the same crime.\u00a0 I do not believe that it enacted\u00a0 two laws,\u00a0 rad:cally different\u00a0 in scope and\u00a0 effect, relative\u00a0 to the same subject matter, and left both in\u00a0 force at the same\u00a0 time.<br\/><br\/>While I can\u00a0 not agree that\u00a0 the\u00a0 information\u00a0 ought\u00a0 in fairness to be held sufficient to charge the crime defined and punished by Acts Nos. 749 and 1792, the allegations therein to that end being,\u00a0 when confronted with the requirements of the statutes, ambiguous and uncertain, to say the\u00a0 least, I am of the opinion that it is legally sufficient to charge the crime\u00a0 of embezzlement.\u00a0 Although not artistically drawn, it contains, in substance and\u00a0 effect, all of the allegations required by\u00a0 law.\u00a0\u00a0 It alleges\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 the\u00a0 official character\u00a0 of the accused;\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 the receipt\u00a0 by him\u00a0 in such\u00a0 capacity\u00a0 of P1,275.16,\u00a0 public money; (3)\u00a0 a legal demand by the proper authority for its production;\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 the\u00a0 refusal to produce; and\u00a0 (5) the absence of said funds from the depositary provided by law in\u00a0 such cases.<br\/><br\/>Having found that the crime charged\u00a0 is\u00a0 embezzlement and it\u00a0 being, in my\u00a0 judgment, necessary, in order to convict, to allege and prove the absence of the funds or property, in addition to the failure, neglect or refusal to produce, it is unnecessary for me to consider at this time the question presented on appeal relative to the constitutionality of that portion of the Act which is\u00a0 alleged to make the failure, neglect or\u00a0 refusal to render an account, of itself, a crime.<br\/><\/div>",

After four days' detention\u00a0 the defendant released him upon his promise to pay the defendant ?150, which he afterwards did.\u00a0 There was no evidence to show that\u00a0 the defendant arrested Sergio for the purpose of extorting this money from him.\"\u00a0 The court in that case held \"that the crime committed was that of\u00a0 bribery, defined and punished in article 383 of the Penal Code,\u00a0 and not the offense defined in section 19 of Act No, 175.\"<\/blockquote>The\u00a0 court said (p. 448):<br\/><blockquote>\"It is suggested\u00a0 by the Solicitor-General\u00a0 that the case falls within section 19 of Act No.\u00a0 175.\u00a0\u00a0 We do not think, however,\u00a0 that that section is applicable, for there is no proof that the arrest was made for the purpose of extorting this money from the complaining witness.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the case at bar it clearly appears from the evidence that the Chinaman from\u00a0 whom\u00a0 the money was extorted had not committed the crime for the commission of\u00a0 which the appellant threatened to arrest him and that he had been guilty of no illegal act whatever.\u00a0\u00a0 It is equally unquestioned that the accused knew that fact.\u00a0 This being so, it does not fall within the principle involved in the decision of the case above cited, as the particular reason in that case why the accused was held guilty of bribery was that it did not appear that the person from whom the money was obtained was not guilty of\u00a0 any crime, but, on the contrary, it\u00a0 appeared that it was very likely that the crime had been committed and that the accused\u00a0 had\u00a0 reasonable ground upon\u00a0 which to make the arrest.\u00a0 It is the necessary inference from that case that if it had appeared that, to the knowledge of the accused, no crime had been\u00a0 committed,\u00a0 and, therefore,\u00a0 he had no ground upon\u00a0 which to make\u00a0 the\u00a0 arrest,\u00a0 in other words, if he had arrested the accused knowing that\u00a0 he had no\u00a0 right to do so, he would have been guilty of the crime defined and penalized in section 19 of Act No.\u00a0 175, instead of being guilty of bribery under article 383 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 This for the reason that he would have made\u00a0 the arrest for the purpose, necessarily, of extorting the\u00a0 money from\u00a0 the complainant.<br\/><br\/>It appearing in this\u00a0 case that the Chinaman Chan Cam was not guilty of any crime at the time of his arrest, and that the appellant in this case knew that fact, the necessary inference is \"that the arrest was made for the purpose of extorting this money from the complaining witness.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of the\u00a0 United States <i>vs.<\/i> Fulgencio\u00a0 (2 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 452), it\u00a0 appeared that one Eulogio, with certain companions, \"had\u00a0 overturned a barrel from a<i> carreton<\/i> and scattered\u00a0 its contents in\u00a0 the\u00a0 streets. The defendant and\u00a0 his companions had, on this account, either arrested the witness or threatened to do so unless money was paid to them.\" After the arrest the\u00a0 accused, who was\u00a0 a\u00a0 policeman, told Eulogio that if he would give him P20 he would release him from arrest.\u00a0\u00a0 Eulogio paid the money as requested and was released from restraint.<br\/><br\/>In that case the court\u00a0 held that the offense fell\u00a0 within the provisions of article 383 of the Penal Code,\u00a0 saying that \"a police officer who receives money in consideration of\u00a0 his not\u00a0 arresting anyone guilty of a breach\u00a0 of a municipal ordinance is guilty of receiving a bribe under article 383 of the Penal\u00a0 Code.\"<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that there was present as one of the essential elements in the above case the fact that there had been\u00a0 a crime committed and that it\u00a0 was the duty of the accused to make the arrest and present the offender before the proper authorities for examination.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Navarro, 3 Phil. Rep., 633; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Valdehueza, 4 Phil. Rep., 470; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Horca, 6 Phil.

Jader\u00a0 (1 Phil. Rep., 297),\u00a0 it appeared that\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant, Damaso Jader, as<i> cabeza de barangay<\/i> and <i>teniente<\/i> of the barrio of Candelaria demanded of certain of the inhabitants\u00a0 \"cocks, hens, bamboo, and other articles under promise to relieve the persons from whom he had obtained them of the obligation to perform certain duties which they as citizens were required to perform.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Under such demands said articles were delivered by certain of\u00a0 the citizens.\u00a0 Upon these facts\u00a0 an information was filed against the accused charging him with the crime of bribery.<br\/><br\/>The court in its decision said (p. 298):<br\/><blockquote>\"The facts upon which the prosecutions\u00a0 are based\u00a0 constitute, in\u00a0 our opinion, five\u00a0 offenses of estafa\u00a0 and not of bribery.\u00a0 The articles received by the accused were\u00a0 not offered to him nor were they donated by the five taxpayers of his department for the purpose of corrupting\u00a0 him and in order to induce him to omit the performance of\u00a0 his duty, but were demanded by the defendant,\u00a0 who\u00a0 thereby abused his office as <i>cabeza de barangay <\/i>and <i>teniente<\/i> of the barrio. Therefore,\u00a0 instead of applying to these facts articles\u00a0 383, 385, and 387\u00a0 of the Penal Code, section 1\u00a0 of article 534 should be applied,\u00a0 in connection with section 1 of article 535 and article 399 of the same code.\u00a0 These\u00a0 facts constitute exactions committed by a public functionary by an abuse of his official position, to the prejudice and\u00a0 in fraud of his fellow-citizens.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The court in that case reversed the judgment of the court below convicting the accused of bribery, and in lieu thereof convicted him of estafa and sentenced him accordingly.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 this case\u00a0 the\u00a0 court expressly found that the\u00a0 property delivered to the accused was obtained by force and intimidation.\u00a0\u00a0 He being\u00a0 a\u00a0 high official of the pueblo,\u00a0 and having considerable power, was able to\u00a0 coerce by a mere demand, particularly when\u00a0 cognizance is taken of the history\u00a0 of the office of\u00a0 <i>cabeza de barangay<\/i> and\u00a0 the\u00a0 tradition which in this country surrounded that\u00a0 office.\u00a0\u00a0 While in that case the force and intimidation practiced are not so\u00a0 apparent as in the case at bar, still force and intimidation were present. They were the\u00a0 foundation of the decision.\u00a0 If they had not been\u00a0 present, the crime would hsive fallen under the provisions relating to bribery or kindred crime.<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 is apparent, therefore,\u00a0 that\u00a0 under this decision,\u00a0 as well\u00a0 as\u00a0 under\u00a0 those\u00a0 above cited,\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime before us\u00a0 in the case at bar\u00a0 is not bribery.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither do we believe that it is <i>estafa. <\/i> Article\u00a0 399 of the Penal Code, referred\u00a0 to\u00a0 in the case last cited, provides\u00a0 that \"the public official who, taking advantage of his office, shall commit any of the crimes specified in chapter\u00a0 4,\u00a0 section\u00a0 2,\u00a0 title 13 of this\u00a0 book (swindles and other false pretenses), shall incur in addition to the penalties prescribed herein that of temporary special disqualification\u00a0 in its\u00a0 maximum degree to perpetual special disqualification.\"\u00a0\u00a0 As is readily\u00a0 seen, this article does no more than provide an additional\u00a0 punishment for the public officials who make their offices the means of committing <i>estafa.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 Before this article can be applied, the official must not only have taken\u00a0 advantage of his office\u00a0 but he must also have\u00a0 committed <i>estafa.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 The essential element of<i> estafa<\/i> as defined in article 535, paragraph 1, referred to in the decision above quoted,\u00a0 is\u00a0 deceit,\u00a0 artifice, machination, or cunning. (Groizard, vol.\u00a0 5; Viada, vol. 3.)\u00a0\u00a0 In that case the presence of deceit is expressly negatived by the finding of the court that the\u00a0 property was\u00a0 demanded,\u00a0 indicating clearly that there was on the part of the persons owning the property, no deceit and therefore no voluntary delivery thereof, the latter an\u00a0 element always essential to the crime of <i>estafa.<\/i> If property is obtained by deceit, cunning, fraud or misrepresentation, the delivery is always voluntary as contrasted with the delivery of property under force or intimidation. Obtaining property by\u00a0 fraud is, in a sense, obtaining\u00a0 it against the true will of\u00a0 the owner;\u00a0 but not in the sense of obtaining it by force or intimidation.<br\/><br\/>We do not believe, therefore, that\u00a0 this case should govern us in the decision of the case\u00a0 before us.\u00a0\u00a0 Under\u00a0 the law in force here, we are of the opinion that the correct doctrine is laid down in the case of the United States <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Smith (3 Phil. Rep., 20).\u00a0 In this case the facts were that\u00a0 (p. 21):<br\/><blockquote>\"On or about the 8th day of January, 1903, the defendant entered the house of one Esteban Delgado, acting justice of the peace,\u00a0 and then'and there represented that he was a\u00a0 detective and that he was looking for certain persons called Josef a Garcia and Pedro Ralla.\u00a0 These said persons were called by the said defendant to the\u00a0 house of the said Delgado on the said day.\u00a0 When the\u00a0 said\u00a0 Josefa Garcia and Pedro Ralla\u00a0 arrived\u00a0 in\u00a0 the said\u00a0 house,\u00a0 the accused informed\u00a0 them that he had authority to\u00a0 arrest\u00a0 them, and that he had arrested one Isabelo Madera,\u00a0 and that he could release\u00a0 him.\u00a0 The defendant showed a letter\u00a0 to\u00a0 these persons, which he told\u00a0 them was his\u00a0 authority\u00a0 to arrest them.\u00a0\u00a0 Later, on\u00a0 the\u00a0 same day, the accused ordered the said Josefa and Pedro to\u00a0 prepare their\u00a0 clothing in order to go to Manila,\u00a0 because\u00a0 he\u00a0 was going\u00a0 to take them\u00a0 as prisoners.\u00a0 He also ordered the said Delgado to prepare a vehicle to take\u00a0 the so-called prisoners\u00a0 to a\u00a0 point where he could secure transportation to Manila.\u00a0 A vehicle could not be found.\u00a0 The said Josefa and Pedro prepared their clothing for the trip to\u00a0 Manila.\u00a0 During the conversation between the accused\u00a0 and\u00a0 the said\u00a0 Josefa\u00a0 and Pedro the former\u00a0 continually threatened them with arrest and\u00a0 with personal harm.\u00a0 After the said persons were so arrested by the accused, he informed them that they had a remedy.\u00a0\u00a0 He gave them to understand that if they would give him $1,000, Mexican, he would release them.\u00a0 Finally a compromise was made on the amount, and Josef a and Pedro paid to the said accused the sum of $700, Mexican.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Upon these facts this court held the defendant guilty of the crime of\u00a0 robbery and not <i>estafa<\/i>.\u00a0 In its opinion\u00a0 the court cited a decision of the supreme court of Spain rendered on the 24th of June, 1875.\u00a0 In that case it appeared\u00a0 that the accused presented himself at the\u00a0 houses of various persons and demanded money on the pretext that it\u00a0 was for a band of malefactors who were in the mountains,\u00a0 and that he had been commissioned by such band to make such demands.\u00a0 He collected various sums\u00a0 from different\u00a0 individuals.\u00a0 The question before the court\u00a0 was whether\u00a0 the crime was robbery with intimidation or simply <i>estafa.<\/i>\u00a0 That court held that each demand constituted robbery with intimidation, saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"Whereas, the essential\u00a0 element of the\u00a0 crime of<i> estafa<\/i> consists in the ingenuity or cunning employed by the agent for the purpose of deceiving the one whom it is intended to victimize, and\u00a0 such astuteness\u00a0 and\u00a0 cunning consequently exclude all idea of intimidation or the employment of other means of like nature tending to prevent or impede\u00a0 the exercise of the will, which remains\u00a0 free and independent although influenced by the statements made, circumstances which are also present in the perpetration of the deceit as mentioned in\u00a0 the Penal Code;\u00a0 and\u00a0 whereas whether\u00a0 the statement as to the band of malefactors was merely an invention for the purpose of obtaining the money, or whether the band\u00a0 actually existed, Pascual Mengaul y Domenech,\u00a0 on demanding the sums he\u00a0 appears to have received from different persons, attained his object by means of threats of injury which the\u00a0 robbers\u00a0 might inflict upon\u00a0 the persons upon whom the demands were made, if those persons did not comply therewith; and\u00a0 whereas this intimidation was\u00a0 actually present, the acts committed can not legally be considered to constitute estafa or deceit.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The crime of robbery, in its\u00a0 various phases\u00a0 as defined by the Penal Code of these Islands, includes the common-law crimes of burglary, robbery, and some cases of extortion. It does not\u00a0 seem strange or\u00a0 illogical, therefore, to\u00a0 hold the crime proved in the case at bar to be robbery, although in Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions\u00a0 it\u00a0 would\u00a0 probably not\u00a0 be\u00a0 so denominated.<br\/><br\/>As we have seen, the\u00a0 information\u00a0 in this case charges bribery.\u00a0\u00a0 It expressly negatives the essential elements of robbery, force or intimidation, or both, by asserting that it was the duty of the accused to make the arrest, indicating necessarily\u00a0 by\u00a0 such assertion that the Chinaman had committed a crime and that he ought to have been apprehended and presented.\u00a0\u00a0 In such\u00a0 case the Chinaman parted\u00a0 with his money voluntarily in order to escape arrest, conviction and punishment.\u00a0 Bribery and robbery have little in\u00a0 common as regards\u00a0 their\u00a0 essential\u00a0 elements.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 the former the transaction\u00a0 is mutual and voluntary.\u00a0\u00a0 In the latter\u00a0 case the transaction\u00a0 is\u00a0 neither mutual nor voluntary but is\u00a0 consummated by the\u00a0 use of force or\u00a0 intimidation.<br\/><br\/>The information in this case does not set forth facts constituting robbery, and the accused can not be here convicted of that crime.\u00a0\u00a0 The facts proved showing robbery under the case of the United States\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.\u00a0 Smith, supra, and not\u00a0 bribery, as charged,\u00a0 the judgment below\u00a0 must be reversed\u00a0 and the information dismissed.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano,\u00a0 C.

On returning\u00a0 to the house of Montemayor between 5 and 6 o'clock on the\u00a0 afternoon of October 21, the defendant found Montemayor's daughter, Maria, who was about 20 years of age and single, alone\u00a0 in\u00a0 the house.\u00a0\u00a0 Shortly thereafter Maria's father arrived,\u00a0 and on his entering\u00a0 the house and finding the two young people alone, trouble ensued, resulting in the defendant being compelled to leave on that same afternoon or evening.\u00a0 As to the cause of\u00a0 the trouble the witnesses do\u00a0 not agree.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is\u00a0 impossible to reconcile\u00a0 their testimony so as to admit of each swearing the truth.<br\/><br\/>Maria testified that when Tomas Cruz returned on that afternoon she\u00a0 was alone and in the kitchen; that he entered the kitchen where she was, closed the door, approached her, and began making indecent proposals; that on her rejecting his proposals,\u00a0 he caught her by the hands, threw her down upon the floor, placed himself on top of her, and was proceeding to\u00a0 rape her;\u00a0 that she screamed, calling for\u00a0 help, and that just at that moment her father and aunt arrived, pushed open the door, entered and caught the defendant\u00a0 in the act of\u00a0 attempting to forcibly have carnal intercourse with her.<br\/><br\/>Domingo Montemayor and\u00a0 Josefa Cruz, father and\u00a0 aunt of Maria, corroborate the testimony\u00a0 of Maria as to what the defendant\u00a0 was\u00a0 doing when they arrived.<br\/><br\/>The defendant testified that on his\u00a0 entering the house\u00a0 at that time he found Maria alone and in the sola; that after conversing with her a few moments they took a seat together on a bench by an open window; that within a\u00a0 short\u00a0 time Maria's father arrived and began doing something in the yard; that\u00a0 while Domingo was still in the yard one Victoriano Beltran arrived, and after the two men talked for a few moments together, Domingo\u00a0 invited Beltran into the house; that on entering Domingo asked his daughter Maria where her mother was, and on receiving the reply that she had gone to the sementera he became very angry and abused the girl for being so intimate with him\u00a0 (the defendant) when they were alone in the house and that as\u00a0 a result of\u00a0 this trouble he was driven from the house by Domingo.\u00a0 The testimony of this witness is corroborated in every essential detail by that of Victoriano Beltran.<br\/><br\/>On the following day, October 22, Domingo Montemayor filed a complaint in the justice of the peace court, charging the defendant with the crime\u00a0 of attempted\u00a0 rape.\u00a0 In the preliminary investigation which followed, Domingo Montemayor, his daughter Maria, and Josefa Cruz were called and testified as witnesses\u00a0 for the prosecution.\u00a0 Maria, after being duly sworn, and on being asked by Pascual Lozano, who was representing the prosecution, what had occurred in her house on the afternoon of October 21, testified that when her father arrived\u00a0 he\u00a0 found her and the defendant alone, sitting1 together on a bench near the open window in the sala, and that the defendant did nothing wrong on that afternoon. When\u00a0 Maria began answering\u00a0 questions in this manner, her father, who was sitting by her side, said to her: \"Tell the truth.\"\u00a0 The justice of the peace then threatened to send Domingo to\u00a0 jail if\u00a0 he again spoke to the\u00a0 witness. Maria then changed her answers and\u00a0 testified the same as she did in the Court of First Instance as to what occurred in the kitchen.\u00a0 The answer\u00a0 to\u00a0 the first question\u00a0 given by Josefa Cruz, as to what was going on in Domingo's house when\u00a0 she\u00a0 arrived, was the same as Maria's first answer; but she also changed and stated that she saw the defendant trying to rape Maria in the kitchen.\u00a0 These facts have been clearly established by the testimony of the justice of\u00a0 the peace and Lozano.\u00a0\u00a0 Domingo Montemayor swore positively on the trial of this case in the Court of First Instance that he did not speak to his daughter while\u00a0 she was testifying in the justice of the peace court; and that the justice of the peace did not threaten to send him to jail.\u00a0 Whereas, as a matter of fact, this did occur in that preliminary investigation as testified to by the justice of the peace and Lozano.<br\/><br\/>This crime, according to the prosecution, occurred in the daytime, in the house of the offended party, surrounded by other houses and in easy hearing\u00a0 distance.\u00a0\u00a0 The house of Josef a, Maria's aunt, was only about 8 brazas away.\u00a0 Men ordinarily do not commit, or attempt to commit, rape under such circumstances.\u00a0 We are satisfied that\u00a0 the theory of the defense is the correct one.\u00a0\u00a0 When Montemayor arrived and found the\u00a0 two young people alone in the\u00a0 sala he began abusing\u00a0 them\u00a0 and compelled the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 to leave his house.\u00a0\u00a0 Maria herself desired to tell the truth about what occurred when she was testifying in the justice of the peace court and began doing so, but changed no doubt on account of fear of her father.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is, therefore, reversed and the defendant acquitted, with costs <i>de oficio.<\/i><br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

It appears to us to be not only a fair but a necessary conclusion\u00a0 from the\u00a0 exhibits that\u00a0 in the year 1811, as well\u00a0 as in the year 1856, the lands constituting the five parcels here in controversy were a\u00a0 swamp, partly covered with water at high tide and mostly dry during low tide, in which\u00a0 then grew and now grow various\u00a0 species of trees and marine shrubs\u00a0 and plants.\u00a0 So\u00a0 far as can be gathered from the evidence,\u00a0 substantially\u00a0 no change\u00a0 has\u00a0 taken\u00a0 place\u00a0 in the contour of\u00a0 these lands\u00a0 during all\u00a0 the years intervening from\u00a0 1856 to the present time.\u00a0\u00a0 Judicial bodies\u00a0 are\u00a0 presumed,\u00a0 in the\u00a0 absence\u00a0 of proof to the contrary, to\u00a0 have performed their duties according to law; and the <i>Audiencia de Manila<\/i> having in the year 1856 judicially decreed the lands in question to be\u00a0 an integral part of the hacienda, it must be conclusively presumed that\u00a0 said lands were\u00a0 of such a\u00a0 character\u00a0 that\u00a0 they could legally be adjudicated private\u00a0 property.\u00a0\u00a0 It is\u00a0 to be presumed, therefore,\u00a0 that the lands were not\u00a0 \"alluvion\" or \"<i>playas<\/i>,\" they not having been expressly\u00a0 shown to be such.<br\/><br\/>We necessarily find, therefore, that the contention of the Government in this regard is unfounded.<br\/><br\/>The third assignment of error presented by the Government is that the learned trial court erred in\u00a0 admitting\u00a0 as evidence Exhibit G over the objection and exception of the attorney for the\u00a0 Government.\u00a0\u00a0 This exhibit is a\u00a0 writing, signed\u00a0 by Enrique\u00a0 Rodriguez,\u00a0 by\u00a0 himself and as\u00a0 the\u00a0 representative\u00a0 of\u00a0 his\u00a0 sisters, addressed to the\u00a0 military\u00a0 and naval commander of the Province of Manila,\u00a0 opposing the petition of one Felix Torres,\u00a0 who prayed the use of the Lake of Dalahican, in the vicinity of Bacoor, as a place for the\u00a0 growing\u00a0 of <i>mariscos<\/i>.\u00a0 Enrique\u00a0 Rodriguez was\u00a0 the owner of the hacienda in question at the time when this writing bears date, and his opposition was founded in the proposition that he was the owner of the lands the use of which was sought by Felix\u00a0 Torres.\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose\u00a0 of the introduction of the writing in question was to demonstrate the validity of the claim of the petitioner in this case that he and his antecessors had been in possession of the lands in question and had maintained that possession against the world.\u00a0 We do not stop to decide whether or not the exhibit was competent evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 There\u00a0 is abundant proof in the record, aside from the exhibit in question, to sustain the conclusion of the court upon\u00a0 the facts in controversy.\u00a0 Its introduction in evidence was, therefore, without prejudice to the complaining party.<br\/><br\/>The Government has not shown itself entitled to oppose the registration of the land in question upon any ground. As\u00a0 we have\u00a0 before\u00a0 stated, the evidence is clear that the lands in question are not\u00a0 alluvion.\u00a0 While\u00a0 it appears from the record that a part of the lands are covered at least a portion of the time with\u00a0 water, it has not been shown by the Government that said waters are navigable or that any portion of the land is \"playas,\" in the\u00a0 real sense\u00a0 of that word.\u00a0 On the contrary, the proof seems to indicate by a fair preponderance that the\u00a0 water covering said lands is very shallow, is filled with a growth of marine trees, shrubs and plants, that at low tide most of it disappears.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover,\u00a0 it is apparent from the same proofs\u00a0 that such lands are \"<i>playas\"<\/i> within the meaning of the law. <br\/><br\/>For these reasons we affirm the judgment of the court below, without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano,\u00a0 C. J., Mapa<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/><center><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">DISSENTING<\/span><br\/><\/center> <br\/><br\/><br\/><b>CARSON,<i>J.,<\/i> <\/b><br\/><br\/>I dissent.\u00a0 I think\u00a0 the\u00a0 evidence of\u00a0 record\u00a0 clearly discloses that a large portion of the tract which\u00a0 petitioner seeks to register in now and always has been\u00a0 a navigable lake, connected with the open sea by a\u00a0 navigable channel; that neither petitioner nor his predecessors in interest ever had or received possession, judicial or otherwise, of this lake; that this\u00a0 lake belongs to\u00a0 the State;\u00a0 and\u00a0 that the decree declaring\u00a0 the petitioner entitled to register the tract\u00a0 described in his application should be modified so as to exclude this lake therefrom.<\/div>",

The\u00a0 defendant,\u00a0 on\u00a0 being notified\u00a0 of the\u00a0 attempt of said administrator to sell the parcel of land of which he claimed to be the owner,\u00a0 entered\u00a0 a protest to said administrator against such\u00a0 sale.\u00a0 Notwithstanding\u00a0 the protest\u00a0 the administrator sold or attempted to sell the\u00a0 land\u00a0 described, including that belonging\u00a0 to the\u00a0 defendant.\u00a0 The defendant is now in possession\u00a0 of the land and has\u00a0 been ever since the execution of the lease in 1903.\u00a0\u00a0 This action was commenced by the plaintiff to quiet title to the said land and for a mandatory injunction\u00a0 prohibiting the defendant from\u00a0 exercising any rights in relation thereto or of performing any acts in contravention\u00a0 of the\u00a0 rights asserted by the plaintiff.\u00a0\u00a0 While the prayer for relief does not in terms ask\u00a0 for the delivery of possession of the land and is not the prayer\u00a0 usually found in an action of ejectment to test the title to land\u00a0 and to recover possession\u00a0 thereof, we, notwithstanding, treat it as such, the parties\u00a0 having themselves\u00a0 during the\u00a0 whole course of the\u00a0 proceedings acted upon that theory.<\/p><p>Upon the trial\u00a0 the learned court below found in favor of the plaintiff, declaring that\u00a0 he was\u00a0 the owner of the land,\u00a0 and ordered restitution of\u00a0 possession, the\u00a0 defendant to pay the costs of the action.<\/p><p>We are of the opinion that the judgment cannot stand upon\u00a0 the facts.\u00a0 Th\u00a7 lands of which Matea Rosales died seized are described as\u00a0 measuring 38 meters and 30 centimeters front and 33 meters and 30 centimeters deep.\u00a0 The lands which form\u00a0 the subject matter of the <em>pacto de retro<\/em> are described as being 30 meters and 48 centimeters front and\u00a0 30 meters and\u00a0 88 centimeters deep.\u00a0 It appearing that the lands in dispute in this litigation are located upon the corner of the lot described as 38 meters and 30 centimeters front, and it appearing that said\u00a0 lot so claimed by the defendant\u00a0 would occupy the space which\u00a0 is indicated by the difference between the description of the lot of which Matea died seized\u00a0 and\u00a0 the description of the lot\u00a0 sold by her to the\u00a0 plaintiff under <em>pacto de retro,<\/em>\u00a0 it is clear\u00a0 to our minds that the change\u00a0 in the\u00a0 description from the original lot to that sold under pacto\u00a0 de retro indicates a clear intention to exclude from the<em> pacto de retro<\/em> the lot occupied by the defendant as lessee.\u00a0 As a matter of fact, the description in the pacto de retro does not cover the lot in litigation.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff, relying upon the <em>pacto de retro<\/em>, must stand\u00a0 or fall\u00a0 by its terms reasonably interpreted.\u00a0 There is no\u00a0 part of the record from which we could draw\u00a0 the inference that Matea Rosales in executing the <em>pacto de retro<\/em> intended to convey more land than was actually described therein.\u00a0 Neither does it appear from the record that, prior to the\u00a0 dispute which terminated in this litigation, the plaintiff himself was under the impression or had the belief that he\u00a0 had\u00a0 acquired more\u00a0 land than that\u00a0 actually described in the instrument which he\u00a0 accepted.\u00a0 There being, then, nothing\u00a0 in\u00a0 the whole case\u00a0 from which we\u00a0 can adjudge that the intention of the\u00a0 parties was\u00a0 to deal with\u00a0 other or\u00a0 different land than that described\u00a0 by the instrument which\u00a0 they executed, we\u00a0 must construe that instrument according to its terms.\u00a0\u00a0 By so doing we exclude the transfer of the\u00a0 land in litigation from the terms of said instrument. It being clear that the sale with the right\u00a0 to repurchase was not\u00a0 intended to include\u00a0 and did\u00a0 not include the piece of land\u00a0 here in litigation, it necessarily follows that\u00a0 the sale by Filomena Rosales to Florencio Noel, the defendant, of said land was a valid sale and conveyed the ownership of said land.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, at the time of the sale by\u00a0 the administrator in the\u00a0 year 1907, the defendant had been\u00a0 the owner\u00a0 and in undisturbed possession of the\u00a0 land\u00a0 in\u00a0 question for\u00a0 more than two years.\u00a0 The\u00a0 sale by the administrator\u00a0 was not really a sale at all but\u00a0 merely an <em>attempt<\/em> to sell\u00a0 which,\u00a0 for the reasons we have just presented, was wholly futile.\u00a0\u00a0 The administrator, being powerless to\u00a0 sell the land\u00a0 in dispute, could convey nothing whatever to plaintiff in this case by virtue of said attempt to sell.<\/p><p>For\u00a0 these reasons we\u00a0 hereby reverse the judgment and dismiss the complaint upon the merits.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em> Arellano, C.

In\u00a0 that action the accused in the present\u00a0 case testified as a witness that he was\u00a0 in company with the brother of Jose Quebengco, who performed\u00a0 the marriage ceremony proved in the seduction case, during the whole day of the 27th of October, the day on which the said marriage ceremony took place, and that the said brother of Jose Quebengco did not perform any such marriage ceremony on said\u00a0 day.<\/p><p>It having been ascertained that the testimony given by the accused as a witness in behalf of the\u00a0 defendant in the seduction\u00a0 case was\u00a0 false, the information in this case was presented against him and\u00a0 he\u00a0 was prosecuted thereunder.<\/p><p>The guilt\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 is\u00a0 proved\u00a0 overwhelmingly. He himself, testifying as witness in\u00a0 his own behalf, substantially\u00a0 admits the\u00a0 falsity\u00a0 of\u00a0 his previous\u00a0 testimony. Every essential element of perjury is present.<\/p><p>Counsel for the appellant alleges two errors.\u00a0 The first one is that the judge erred in denying\u00a0 the application of the accused that he be tried before another court\u00a0 by reason of an\u00a0 alleged prejudice against the defendant on the part of the trial court.\u00a0 The only ground presented by the defendant for the alleged prejudice is the fact that said court, on the trial of the seduction case\u00a0 against Quebengco, became satisfied that the accused in this\u00a0 case\u00a0 committed\u00a0 perjury and, therefore, ordered the fiscal to present an information against him if he could obtain sufficient evidence.\u00a0 This in no\u00a0 sense disqualified the judge.\u00a0 If a trial judge is convinced that a witness in any case before him is deliberately, willfully and\u00a0 corruptly swearing falsely on\u00a0 a\u00a0 material matter, it is not only his right but it is his duty to see that such witness is duly prosecuted.\u00a0 Men's lives and property are wholly insecure in a community where perjury is prevalent.\u00a0 If a court\u00a0 can not believe the witnesses\u00a0 who testify before him, then his judgment is\u00a0 but a guess and real justice is impossible.\u00a0 There is nothing more fatal to justice than a corrupt witness.\u00a0\u00a0 The learned trial court performed his duty when he ordered the prosecution\u00a0 of the accused.<\/p><p>The second and last assignment of error is that the court erred in finding\u00a0 the accused guilty of the crime\u00a0 charged. As we\u00a0 have already said, the proofs demonstrate beyond a reasonable\u00a0 doubt that\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 is guilty of the\u00a0 crime\u00a0 of perjury and that the court would have been\u00a0 remiss in its duty in making any other finding.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 judgment appealed\u00a0 from is hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em>\u00a0 and<em> Carson, JJ.<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

J. S. Powell presiding, convicting\u00a0 the accused of murder and sentencing him to life\u00a0 imprisonment.<br\/><br\/>There is no question whatever about the\u00a0 fact that the accused caused the death of Susana de Ocampo.\u00a0 It appears from the record that\u00a0 about the middle of August, 1910, the remains of a dead\u00a0 person\u00a0 were found by the lieutenant of the barrio in a dry creek bed\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 municipality\u00a0 of Guimbal,\u00a0 Province\u00a0 of\u00a0 Iloilo.\u00a0 Prior to the finding of the body, Susana\u00a0 de Ocampo had\u00a0 been missing from her home for\u00a0 more\u00a0 than\u00a0 two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 police of\u00a0 Guimbal had known of the disappearance of\u00a0 the\u00a0 woman but had made no search for her for the reason that it was not suspected that she was\u00a0 the victim of foul play,\u00a0 but\u00a0 it was believed by them, and generally understood by all, that she had gone on a visit.\u00a0 When the\u00a0 remains\u00a0 were found\u00a0 it was noticed that a scarf was tied tightly around the neck, while a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">patadion<\/span> enveloped the body below the waist.\u00a0\u00a0 The <i>camisa <\/i>and\u00a0 underwaist,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 had\u00a0 substantially\u00a0 disappeared. Members of the family of Susana de Ocampo were sent for, especially a young woman, a cousin\u00a0 of the deceased, named Justa de\u00a0 Ocampo, who immediately recognized the scarf and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">patadion<\/span> as belonging to the\u00a0 deceased Susana.<br\/><br\/>For some reason which does not appear in the record, the accused in this case was suspected of having murdered the person whose body was found.\u00a0 Upon this suspicion he was arrested\u00a0 and\u00a0 upon being\u00a0 interrogated made a full\u00a0 and complete confession\u00a0 of his\u00a0 participation in the crime to various policemen and finally to the\u00a0 chief of police.\u00a0 When the preliminary\u00a0 investigation\u00a0 was held he\u00a0 pleaded\u00a0 guilty. At no time did he make any concealment whatever of the fact that he killed Susana.\u00a0\u00a0 It was known before his arrest that\u00a0 he had been illicitly intimate with her and that she had\u00a0 become pregnant\u00a0 thereby.\u00a0 In\u00a0 his confession he admitted this and stated further that on the night of August 1 he went to her house and asked her to be on the beach at a certain hour as he had something to say to her.\u00a0 Having met on the beach according to arrangement, she began to upbraid him for deserting\u00a0 her for another girl\u00a0 whom she asserted he wished to\u00a0 marry.\u00a0 He admitted the truth of her accusation.\u00a0 After some\u00a0 further talk he asked her if she was pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0 She replied that she was and told him that if he did not wish to marry her he would have to make some sort of provision for the child or else she would send him to Bilibid.\u00a0 He told her that he preferred to\u00a0 die rather than go to Bilibid,\u00a0 whereupon she replied that he need not die, that he could kill her instead.\u00a0 He thereupon with her consent took her scarf,\u00a0 tied it around her neck and choked her to death.\u00a0\u00a0 He then\u00a0 picked up\u00a0 her body and deposited it in the dry creek\u00a0 bed, where it\u00a0 was later found.<br\/><br\/>This confession was fully corroborated by the\u00a0 finding of the body exactly where he confessed that he had\u00a0 placed it, by\u00a0 finding the scarf tied tightly around her neck as he asserted it would be, and by the\u00a0 fact that she had met her death in the manner described.<br\/><br\/>The defendant refused to make any statement in his own behalf on the trial and presented\u00a0 no witnesses.<br\/><br\/>We are in entire accord with the\u00a0 learned trial court upon the facts.\u00a0 We are of the opinion,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 that his characterization of the crime is wrong.\u00a0\u00a0 He found that the crime was murder, qualifying it by alevosia.\u00a0 There is no evidence of\u00a0 any kind showing how\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 woman met her death except that presented by the accused\u00a0 himself.\u00a0 The story as detailed by him discloses none of the attributes of treachery.\u00a0\u00a0 The death of Susana was\u00a0 accomplished\u00a0 under an agreement between the two that her life should be\u00a0 taken. As a general rule, one part of a confession can not be taken and the other part\u00a0 rejected unless\u00a0 there are proofs\u00a0 in the record which justify such a\u00a0 course.\u00a0\u00a0 While the story of the accused has, in some respects, the marks of improbability, yet there is absolutely nothing substantial in the case which justifies the acceptance\u00a0 of\u00a0 one\u00a0 portion of\u00a0 the confession and the rejection of the balance.\u00a0\u00a0 We regard the crime as homicide.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Sellano, 10 Phil. Rep., 498.)<br\/><br\/>For\u00a0 these\u00a0 reasons the judgment of the court below is modified and the accused is hereby convicted of the, crime of homicide and sentenced\u00a0 to fourteen years eight months and one day\u00a0 of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">reclusion temporal,<\/span> to indemnify the heirs of the\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 Susana de\u00a0 Ocampo in the sum of P1,000, and to\u00a0 pay the costs of the trial.\u00a0 As so modified, the judgment of the\u00a0 court\u00a0 below is affirmed, with costs <i>de\u00a0 oficio.<\/i><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

McCabe, judge of the Tenth Judicial District, against\u00a0 Mateo Pado (<i>alias<\/i> Bangit)\u00a0 and Fausto Garfin, for the crime of murder.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, Mateo Pado (<i>alias<\/i> Bangit), pleaded guilty and on the\u00a0 trial of\u00a0 his codefendant,\u00a0 Fausto Garfin,\u00a0 gave a detailed account of the crime charged in the information and the circumstances that led up to\u00a0 the commission of the deed, incriminating\u00a0 himself, his son-in-law, Laurencio Indo (who\u00a0 was\u00a0 subsequently\u00a0 shot\u00a0 by the Constabulary\u00a0 while attempting\u00a0 to escape arrest), and his codefendant, Fausto Garfin, as joint perpetrators of the crime.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Fausto\u00a0 Garfin pleaded not guilty.\u00a0 As\u00a0 a witness in his own behalf he admitted that he was present at the house of his brother-in-law, Julian Masuelas, on the evening of\u00a0 December\u00a0 24, 1909,\u00a0 when\u00a0 the\u00a0 latter and his mother, Lucia Copertino,\u00a0 were murdered, and that he then carried a bolo, but\u00a0 claims that instead of having caused Bangit and\u00a0 Laurencio to come there to murder his brother-in-law and family, he himself was one of the victims of the assault, but\u00a0 had the good\u00a0 fortune to escape from the\u00a0 house uninjured.<br\/><br\/>The night before the double murder\u00a0 was committed, about the hour for evening prayers, Fausto Garfin presented himself at the house of the defendant Bangit in\u00a0 the barrio of Alimudias for the purpose of securing the latter's aid in killing his elder sister and her husband, assigning as a reason for the proposition that the proposed victims were witches. Bangit's only opposition to engaging in this enterprise was that he did not know where the barro in which the proposed victims resided was located.\u00a0\u00a0 This objection was overcome by Fausto who assured him\u00a0 that he would accompany him and\u00a0 point out the place.\u00a0 Starting immediately from\u00a0 the barrio of Alimudias, accompanied\u00a0 by Laurencio Indo,\u00a0 the three men, after walking all night, arrived early the next morning in the barrio of Cadolonan where Fausto and\u00a0 the proposed\u00a0 victims lived.\u00a0 The next day, Friday, December 24, 1909,\u00a0 they spent at Fausto's house. They dined at\u00a0 his house\u00a0 and sharpened\u00a0 their bolos for the evening's work. Bangit's account of the subsequent occurrences is as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"My conscience would not allow me to\u00a0 do this wrongful act, and I told him, 'Fausto, I\u00a0 am going to leave.\u00a0 I am going away,' and Fausto stated, 'No, don't be afraid because there will be three of us; you will follow and when I get to\u00a0 the house I will strike the first blow and then you two will strike also;' and we left Fausto's house, Fausto walking ahead and I following behind, came upstairs into Julian's house;\u00a0 his older sister was sitting on\u00a0 the bench.\u00a0 Then Fausto and I sat at her side and Laurencio, my son-in-law, sat\u00a0 by me, and we did not kill his older sister yet because Julian was not there\u00a0 at the house but\u00a0 was in the street, and then\u00a0 his sister,\u00a0 Fausto's sister, asked\u00a0 him, 'What do you come here for?' and I answered, 'We came to buy some tobacco\u00a0 for chewing purposes\/ and Julian had not arrived yet, and shortly afterwards Julian came and he entered the house and stood near his wife and\u00a0 Fausto was yet sitting on the bench.\u00a0 He attracted my attention by touching my foot.\u00a0\u00a0 In other words meaning to rush and strike.\u00a0 I stood up then. My son-in-law also stood up and went to the other\u00a0 side as if trying to circle around both of those persons, and I went to\u00a0 where\u00a0 Julian was\u00a0 standing and stood\u00a0 beside him.\u00a0\u00a0 As I did this, Fausto stood up and immediately struck his sister while I at the same time struck Julian and my son-in-law struck the\u00a0 old. woman, and after we had delivered these blows, Fausto immediately jumped out of the house, passing through one of the side rooms, and then my son-in-law and myself searched around the house to see if there were any persons therein living yet.<br\/><br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <blockquote>\"Q. Who killed Julian and Lucia? - A. My son-in-law and myself killed Julian and Lucia, but Fausto struck Julian once before he died.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Fernanda Garfin, Julian's wife and Fausto's sister, corroborates Bangit as to the absence of her husband when the two strangers accompanied by Fausto arrived at their house on the evening of the murder, and as to the pretense Bangit made\u00a0 of coming there to buy some\u00a0 chewing tobacco.\u00a0 Fernanda testifies that after her husband returned to the house he held a short conversation\u00a0 with the two strangers, and then, instead of sitting down to eat supper with her and the children, began\u00a0 walking the floor.\u00a0\u00a0 While she was\u00a0 eating and he was\u00a0 walking the floor to and fro Bangit \"struck him with the bolo, and Fausto also struck him in the back of his ear and then I\u00a0 tamed around and\u00a0 I said, 'What is this, Fausto?\u00a0 Have you conspired to kill my husband?' And Fausto then jumped out from the house, leaving through the kitchen.\"\u00a0 Fernanda also describes\u00a0 the struggle she made to rescue her husband\u00a0 from\u00a0 the blows of Bangit, in\u00a0 which she seems to have been successful\u00a0 until the third man, Bangit's son-in-law, came to the old man's rescue and with his bolo cut\u00a0 loose both her hands from her grasp on Bangit, and inflicted other grave and serious wounds upon her body. Fernanda then fell\u00a0 to the floor almost unconscious and remained in this state until Bangit and his son-in-law left the house.<br\/><br\/>Seeing the brave fight\u00a0 put up by Fernanda\u00a0 to save her husband Julian,\u00a0 the latter's\u00a0 mother, Lucia Copertino, one of the deceased\u00a0 named in the information, came\u00a0 to Fernanda's assistance, and\u00a0 at the same time crying for help. At that moment Laurencio Indo, Bangit's son-in-law, made a lunge at her with his weapon, stabbing her in the stomach. As a direct result of this\u00a0 wound Lucia died immediately. Bang-it and his son-in-law then proceeded to\u00a0 make away with the two little boys, sons of Julian and Fernanda.\u00a0 These boys, aged nine and ten years, received\u00a0 grave wounds\u00a0 in different parts of their bodies, and\u00a0 no doubt were\u00a0 left for dead.\u00a0 The boys, however, will probably\u00a0 recover, although one of them at the time of the trial was yet in a serious condition.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of Bangit and Fernanda, as to Fausto inflicting a blow on the\u00a0 head of Julian with his bolo before he made his escape, is\u00a0 corroborated by\u00a0 the testimony\u00a0 of Miguel Masuelas, one of the little boys, who swore positively that he saw this blow struck by Fausto.<br\/><br\/>According to the testimony of Fausto Garfin he went to his sister's\u00a0 house\u00a0 about eight o'clock on the night\u00a0 of December 24th to pay a visit.\u00a0 When he arrived Julian, his brother-in-law, had gone out to look for\u00a0 his (Julian's) little boy.\u00a0\u00a0 On entering the house he took a seat and began talking with his sister.\u00a0 After a short time he laid down upon the floor on account of having been drinking\u00a0 a great deal of tuba and then being in an intoxicated state.\u00a0 While he was lying on the floor\u00a0 Julian came in and abused him for being drunk.\u00a0 He then got up arid on leaving the premises he fell against a\u00a0 fence\u00a0 knocking it down and\u00a0 destroying some of Julian's plants.\u00a0 On account of the\u00a0 destruction\u00a0 of these plants Julian became very angry with him.\u00a0 He then went away, but feeling that\u00a0 he should apologize for these acts he returned to the house\u00a0 (Julian's)\u00a0 for this purpose, and while\u00a0 in said house Bangit and Laurencio\u00a0 entered, giving as\u00a0 their excuse for so doing that they\u00a0 wanted\u00a0 to purchase some chewing tobacco.\u00a0 They entered into a conversation with Julian and his wife and shortly thereafter, without any\u00a0 reason, they began attacking the family, including himself, and that fortunately he had the good luck to escape uninjured.\u00a0\u00a0 This testimony of Fausto is entirely uncorroborated.\u00a0 According to his own testimony he made no effort to assist this family against this unlawful attack. He did not return to the house to see what had happened, neither did he notify any of the local officials, or anyone else,\u00a0 of what was taking place in the house of his sister. On the other hand, the account of the crime as given by Bangit is frank and consistent and is fully corroborated by the surrounding circumstances and by the direct and positive testimony\u00a0 of Fernanda Garfin\u00a0 and her little\u00a0 son Miguel Masuelas.\u00a0 The gutft, by direct participation, of the two defendants of the crime charged in the complaint has been established beyond peradventure of a doubt.<br\/><br\/>There was present in the\u00a0 commission of this crime the qualifying circumstance of known premejditation\u00a0 inasmuch as it\u00a0 has been shown that the defendants formed a design to kill the two deceased at least twenty-four hours before the acts were committed.\u00a0 During this period of time they discussed in detail the manner in which this, plan was to be executed.\u00a0 They spent the whole day at Fausto's house sharpening\u00a0 their bolos and perfecting their plans.\u00a0 This circumstance raises the crime to that of murder.\u00a0 The fact that the crime was committed in the house of the offended parties, and at nighttime, must be considered as aggravating circumstances.\u00a0 There must also be considered the aggravating circumstances\u00a0 set forth in Nos. 1 and 3 of article 10 of the Penal Code, the first as to Fausto Garfin\u00a0 and the second as to Bangit.\u00a0 None of the extenuating circumstances set forth in article 9 were present.<br\/><br\/>The trial court properly found that the defendants were guilty as principals of the crime of assassination, marked by the qualifying circumstance of known premeditation and with\u00a0 the generic aggravating circumstances as above set forth, without, as we have said, any of the extenuating circumstance set out\u00a0 in article 9 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 Upon these\u00a0 findings of fact there can be no doubt that the capital penalty was properly imposed, unless in the exercise of the discretion vested in the courts the extenuating circumstance of race should be\u00a0 taken\u00a0 into consideration in favor of the defendants, under\u00a0 the provisions of article 11 of said Code. We ,have concluded\u00a0 to give the defendants\u00a0 the benefit of the provisions of this article.\u00a0 In so doing we are largely influenced by the fact that the principal motive which moved these defendants to\u00a0 commit this\u00a0 terrible crime was that they believed that Julian Masuelas, his wife, and mother were witches.\u00a0 This fact is established by the testimony of Fernanda Garfin herself. She could give no other reason why her brother desired to destroy herself and family.\u00a0 She stated that her brother contended and thought that she had killed and\u00a0 eaten their father.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is true that Bangit was promised ten\u00a0 cavanes of palay for his participation in the commission of this crime, but he\u00a0 testified that\u00a0 he desired to rid the\u00a0 community of these witches; that he had been informed, and believed, that the old\u00a0 woman,\u00a0 Lucia was accustomed to\u00a0 eating children\u00a0 whenever she could\u00a0 find any alone.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 superstition was so imbedded in the minds of these defendants that they thought they were rendering their community a service when they\u00a0 massacred these people. The defendants have spent their lives in a remote, mountainous\u00a0 barrio of the province where they have had no opportunity to\u00a0 come\u00a0 in contact with\u00a0 the\u00a0 more enlightened people and learn the error of their ways.<br\/><blockquote>\"In the\u00a0 application of the provisions\u00a0 of\u00a0 article 11\u00a0 the courts may use it in their discretion to offset any number of generic\u00a0 aggravating circumstances.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (U, S. <i>vs.<\/i> Bundal, 3 Phil.

Advantage was taken by plaintiff of Act No. 1258 to join as defendants in one action all\u00a0 of the different owners of or persons otherwise interested in the 69,910 square meters of land\u00a0 to be condemned.\u00a0 After filing and duly serving the complaint the plaintiff,\u00a0 pursuant to\u00a0 law and pending final\u00a0 determination of the\u00a0 action, took possession of and occupied the lands described in\u00a0 the complaint,\u00a0 building its line\u00a0 and putting the same in operation.\u00a0 During the progress of the\u00a0 action\u00a0 a commission to appraise the\u00a0 value of the\u00a0 lands was duly appointed,\u00a0 which, after taking oral testimony, amounting to 140 typewritten pages when transcribed, and after much labor and prolonged consideration made a\u00a0 report consisting of about\u00a0 55 typewritten\u00a0 pages, resolving the question submitted to\u00a0 it.\u00a0 On the coming in of this report the court, by\u00a0 order entered the 27th of September, 1909, set the 11th\u00a0 day\u00a0 of\u00a0 October\u00a0 following for the hearing thereon.<\/p><p>On the 4th day of October\u00a0 the plaintiff gave notice to the defendants that on the 9th day of October a motion would\u00a0 be made to the court to dismiss the action upon the ground that the court had no jurisdiction of the subject matter, it\u00a0 having just been ascertained by the plaintiff that\u00a0 the\u00a0 land sought to be condemned was situated in the Province of Nueva Ecija, instead of the Province of Tarlac, as alleged in the complaint.\u00a0 This motion was heard and, after due consideration, the trial court dismissed the action upon the ground presented by the plaintiff.\u00a0 This appeal is taken from said judgment of dismissal.<\/p><p>The decision of the learned trial court was based entirely upon the proposition,\u00a0 already referred to, that in condemnation\u00a0 proceedings, and in all\u00a0 other proceedings affecting title to land, the Court of First Instance of a given province has no jurisdiction, power or authority where the land is\u00a0 located in another province, and that no such power, authority, or jurisdiction can be conferred by the parties.<\/p><p>Sections\u00a0 55 and\u00a0 56 of Act\u00a0 No.\u00a0 136\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Philippine Commission confer jurisdiction upon the Courts of\u00a0 First Instance\u00a0 of these Islands with respect to real estate in\u00a0 the following words:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Sec. 55. <em>Jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance<\/em>.- The jurisdiction\u00a0 of\u00a0 Courts of First Instance shall be\u00a0 of two kinds:\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"1.

Others provide for the procedure\u00a0 by which that power or authority is projected into judgment.\u00a0 The one class deals with the\u00a0 powers of the court in the real\u00a0 and substantive sense; the other with the procedure by\u00a0 which such powers are put into action.\u00a0\u00a0 The one is the thing itself; the other is the\u00a0 vehicle by which the thing\u00a0 is transferred from the court to\u00a0 the\u00a0 parties. The whole purpose and\u00a0 object of procedure is to make the\u00a0 powers of the court fully and completely available\u00a0 for\u00a0 justice.\u00a0 The\u00a0 most perfect procedure that can be devised\u00a0 is that which gives opportunity for the most complete and perfect exercise of\u00a0 the powers of the court within the limitations set by natural justice. It is that one which, in other words, gives the most perfect opportunity for the powers of the court to transmute themselves into\u00a0 concrete\u00a0 acts\u00a0 of justice\u00a0 between the parties before it. [The purpose of such a procedure is not\u00a0 to\u00a0 restrict the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter, but to give it effective facility in righteous action. It may be said\u00a0 in passing that the most salient objection\u00a0 which can be urged against procedure today is that it so restricts the exercise of the court's powers by\u00a0 technicalities that that part of its authority effective for justice between the parties is\u00a0 many times\u00a0 an inconsiderable portion\u00a0 of the whole.\u00a0 The purpose of procedure is not to thwart justice. Its proper aim is to facilitate the application of justice to the rival claims of\u00a0 contending parties.\u00a0 It was created not to hinder and delay but to facilitate and promote the administration of justice.\u00a0\u00a0 It does not constitute the thing itself which courts are always\u00a0 striving\u00a0 to secure to litigants. It is\u00a0 designed as the means best adapted to obtain that thing.\u00a0 In other words, it is a means\u00a0 to an end.\u00a0 It is the means by which the powers of the court are made effective in just judgments.\u00a0\u00a0 When it loses the character of the one and takes on that of the other the administration of justice becomes incomplete and unsatisfactory and lays itself open to grave criticism.<\/p><p>The proper result of a system of procedure is to insure a fair and convenient hearing to the parties\u00a0 with complete justice between them as a result.\u00a0\u00a0 While a fair hearing is as essential as the substantive\u00a0 power of\u00a0 the court\u00a0 to administer justice in\u00a0 the premises,\u00a0 and\u00a0 while\u00a0 the one\u00a0 is the natural result of the other, it is different in\u00a0 its nature and relates to a different thing.\u00a0 The power or authority\u00a0 of the court over the subject matter existed and was fixed\u00a0 before procedure in a given cause began.\u00a0 Procedure does not alter or change that\u00a0 power or authority; it\u00a0 simply directs the manner in which it shall be fully and justly exercised.\u00a0\u00a0 To be sure,\u00a0 in certain cases, if that power is not exercised in conformity with the provisions of the procedural law, purely, the court attempting to exercise it loses the power to exercise it legally.\u00a0 This does not mean that it loses jurisdiction of the subject matter.\u00a0 It means simply that he <em>may<\/em> thereby lose jurisdiction\u00a0 of the\u00a0 person or that the judgment may thereby be rendered defective for lack of something essential to sustain\u00a0 it.\u00a0 There is,\u00a0 of course, an important distinction between person and subject matter with reference to jurisdiction.\u00a0 Jurisdiction of the person ancl jurisdiction of the subject matter are both conferred by law.\u00a0 As to the subject matter, nothing can change the jurisdiction of the court over it. None\u00a0 of the parties to the litigation\u00a0 can enlarge or diminish it or dictate when it shall attach or when it shall be removed.\u00a0 That is a matter of legislative enactment which none but the legislature may change.\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, the jurisdiction of the court over the person is, in some instances, made to depend, indirectly at least, on the party's volition.\u00a0\u00a0 As we have\u00a0 said, jurisdiction of the subject matter does not depend on the consent or objection, on the acts or omissions of the parties or\u00a0 any of them.\u00a0 Jurisdiction over the person, however, may be conferred by consent, expressly or impliedly given, or it may,\u00a0 by an objection, be prevented from attaching or removed after it has attached.<\/p><p>In\u00a0 the light of these observations, we proceed\u00a0 to a consideration\u00a0 of those provisions of the law which the plaintiff claims are decisive of\u00a0 his contention that a Court of First Instance of one province has no jurisdiction of the\u00a0 subject matter of an action by a railroad company to condemn lands located in\u00a0 another province.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff relies for the success of its cause upon section\u00a0 377 of the Code of Civil Procedure\u00a0 and upon the special laws relating to the condemnation of lands by railroad corporations.\u00a0 We take up first the section of the Code of Civil Procedure referred to.<\/p><p>The fact that such a provision appears in the procedural law at once raises a strong presumption that it has nothing to do with the jurisdiction of\u00a0 the court over the subject matter.\u00a0 It becomes merely a matter of method, of convenience to the parties litigant.\u00a0 If their\u00a0 interests are beat subserved by bringing in the Court of First Instance\u00a0 of the city of Manila an action affecting lands in the. Province of Ilocos Norte, there is\u00a0 no controlling reason why such a course should not be followed.\u00a0 The matter is, under the law, entirely within the control of either party.\u00a0 The plaintiff's interests select the venue.\u00a0 If such selection, is not\u00a0 in accordance with section 377, the defendant may make timely objection and, as a result, the venue is changed to meet the requirements of the law.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 true that this court has more than once held that an agreement to submit a controversy to a court which, under the procedural law, has not been\u00a0 selected as the appropriate court, generally speaking, to hear such controversy, can not be enforced.\u00a0 This means simply that either party to such a contract may ignore it\u00a0 at pleasure.\u00a0 The law\u00a0 will\u00a0 not compel\u00a0 the fulfillment of an agreement which\u00a0 deprives\u00a0 one of the parties to it of the right to present his\u00a0 cause to that court which\u00a0 the law designates as the most appropriate.\u00a0 But the principle asserted in the cases which hold thus is no authority for the proposition that two persons having a\u00a0 controversy which they desire to have decided by a\u00a0 competent tribunal may not, by appropriate procudure,\u00a0 submit it\u00a0 to\u00a0 any court having jurisdiction in the premises.\u00a0\u00a0 In the one case the relation\u00a0 is contractual to be enforced over the objection of one of the contracting\u00a0 parties.\u00a0\u00a0 In the other the relation is\u00a0 not contractual because not between the parties; but, rather, between the parties and the court.\u00a0\u00a0 In the one case it is\u00a0 a contract to be enforced; in the other, a condition to be met.<\/p><p>This being so, we\u00a0 say again, even though it be repetition, that after jurisdiction over real property in the Islands has been conferred so generally and fully\u00a0 by Ac,t\u00a0 No. 136, it\u00a0 is not to be <em>presumed<\/em> or <em>construed<\/em> that the legislature intended to <em>modify <\/em>or <em>restrict<\/em>\u00a0 that jurisdiction when it came to frame a Code of Civil\u00a0 Procedure the object\u00a0 of which is to make that jurisdiction effective.\u00a0\u00a0 Such modification or restriction should be held only by virtue of the clearest and most express provisions.<\/p><p>The wording of that section should be carefully examined. It reads as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Sec. 377. <em>Venue of actions<\/em>. - Actions to confirm title to real estate, or to secure a\u00a0 partition of real estate,\u00a0 or to cancel clouds, or remove doubts from the title to real estate, or to obtain possession of real estate, or to recover damages for injuries to real estate, or to establish any interest,\u00a0 right, or title in or to real estate, or actions for the condemnation of real estate for public use, shall be brought in the province were the land, or some part thereof,\u00a0 is situated; actions against executors, administrators, and\u00a0 guardians touching the\u00a0 performance\u00a0 of their official duties, and\u00a0 actions\u00a0 for account and settlement by them, and actions for the distribution of the estates of deceased persons among the heirs and distributees, and actions for the payment of legacies, shall be brought\u00a0 in the province in which the\u00a0 will was admitted to\u00a0 probate, or\u00a0 letters\u00a0 of\u00a0 administration\u00a0 were granted, or the guardian was appointed.\u00a0\u00a0 And all actions not herein otherwise provided for may be brought in any province where the defendant or any necessary party defendant may reside or be found, or in any\u00a0 province where\u00a0 the plaintiff or one of the plaintiffs resides, at the election of the plaintiff, except in cases where other\u00a0 special provision is made in this\u00a0 Code.\u00a0\u00a0 In case neither the plaintiff nor\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 resides within\u00a0 the Philippine\u00a0 Islands and\u00a0 the action is brought to seize or obtain title to property of\u00a0 the defendant within the Philippine Islands, the action shall be brought in the province where the property which the plaintiff seeks to seize or to obtain title to is situated or is found: <em>Provided,<\/em> That in an action for the foreclosure of a mortgage upon real estate, when the service upon the defendant is\u00a0 not personal, but is by publication, in accordance with law,\u00a0 the action must be brought in the province where the land lies. And in all cases process\u00a0 may issue from the court in which an action or special proceeding is pending,\u00a0 to be enforced in any province to bring in\u00a0 defendants and\u00a0 to enforce all orders and decrees of the court.\u00a0\u00a0 The failure of a defendant to object to the venue of the action at the time of entering his appearance in the action shall be deemed a waiver on his part of all objection to the place or tribunal in which the action is\u00a0 brought, except in the actions\u00a0 referred to in the first sixteen lines of this\u00a0 section relating to real estate, and actions against executors,\u00a0 administrators, and guardians, and for the distribution of estates and payment of legacies.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Leaving out of discussion for the moment\u00a0 actions and proceedings\u00a0 affecting\u00a0 estates\u00a0 of deceased\u00a0 persons,\u00a0 they resting upon a different\u00a0 footing being governed by special laws, it is to be observed that the\u00a0 section contains no express inhibition against the court.\u00a0 It provides simply that certain actions\u00a0 affecting real estate \"shall be brought in the\u00a0 province where the land, or\u00a0 some part thereof, is situated.\" The prohibition here is clearly directed against the one who begins the\u00a0 action and lays the venue.\u00a0 The court, before the\u00a0 action\u00a0 is commenced,\u00a0 has\u00a0 nothing to\u00a0 do with\u00a0 either.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff does both.\u00a0\u00a0 Only when that is done does the section begin to operate effectively so far as the court is concerned.\u00a0\u00a0 The prohibition\u00a0 is not a limitation on the power of the court but on the rights of the plaintiff. It is\u00a0 not to\u00a0 take\u00a0 something from the court but to\u00a0 grant something to the defendant.\u00a0 Its wording clearly deprives the court of nothing which\u00a0 it had, but gives the defendant, as\u00a0 against the\u00a0 plaintiff,\u00a0 certain\u00a0 rights\u00a0 which he\u00a0 did\u00a0 not have.\u00a0 It establishes a relation not between\u00a0 the court and the subject inatter, but between\u00a0 the plaintiff and\u00a0 the defendant.\u00a0 It\u00a0 relates not\u00a0 to jurisdiction\u00a0 but to trial.\u00a0 It touches\u00a0 convenience,\u00a0 not substance.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 simply\u00a0 gives\u00a0 to defendant\u00a0 the unqualified right,\u00a0 if he\u00a0 desires it, to have the trial take place where his land lies and where, probably, all\u00a0 of his witnesses live.\u00a0 Its object is\u00a0 to secure to him a convenient trial.\u00a0 If it had\u00a0 been\u00a0 the intention of the lawmakers by section 377\u00a0 to\u00a0 put a limitation to the jurisdiction\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 court, how easy it would have been\u00a0 to say so\u00a0 squarely.\u00a0\u00a0 \"No Court of First Instance shall have\u00a0 or take jurisdiction of an action touching title to or interest in real property lying wholly in a province other than that in which such court is\u00a0 authorized to hold\u00a0 sessions,\" or a similar provision, would have been sufficient.\u00a0 This would have been clearly a limitation\u00a0 on the court rather than the\u00a0 party.\u00a0\u00a0 There would have\u00a0 been no\u00a0 room\u00a0 for doubt. The legislature, however, did not\u00a0 do so.\u00a0 It, rather, chose to use language which imposes\u00a0 a\u00a0 limitation on the rights of the plaintiff.<\/p><p>In saying this\u00a0 we do not desire to\u00a0 force construction. Courts should\u00a0 give to language\u00a0 its plain\u00a0 meaning, leaving the legislature to take care of the consequences.\u00a0\u00a0 The Philippine Commission having, in\u00a0 fullest\u00a0 phrase,\u00a0 given the Courts of First Instance unrestricted jurisdiction over real estate in the Islands by Act No.\u00a0 136, we are of the opinion that that jurisdiction ought not to\u00a0 be held to be withdrawn except by\u00a0 virtue of an\u00a0 Act equally express, or so clearly inconsistent\u00a0 as to amount to the\u00a0 same\u00a0 thing.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact that section 377 is not such Act, that it is found in a Code of Procedure rather than in the\u00a0 substantive law, that it deals with the relative procedural\u00a0 rights\u00a0 of parties rather than the power of the\u00a0 court, that it relates to the <em>place<\/em> rather than to the <em>thing<\/em>, that it composes the whole of a chapter\u00a0 headed simply \"Venue,\" lead us\u00a0 to hold\u00a0 that the Court of First Instance of Tarlac had\u00a0 full\u00a0 jurisdiction of the subject matter of this action at the time when it was dismissed.<\/p><p>That it had jurisdiction of the persons\u00a0 of all the parties is indisputable.\u00a0 That jurisdiction\u00a0 was obtained not only by the usual course of practice\u00a0 that is, by the\u00a0 process of the court - but also by consent expressly given, is apparent. The plaintiff submitted itself to the jurisdiction by beginning the action.\u00a0 (Ayers <em>vs.<\/em> Watson, 113 U.\u00a0 S., 594; Fisher <em>vs<\/em>.\u00a0 Shropshire, 147 U. S., 133.)\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants\u00a0 are now in this court asking that the action be not dismissed but continued.\u00a0\u00a0 They are not only not objecting to the jurisdiction of\u00a0 the\u00a0 court but, rather, are here on this appeal for the purpose of maintaining that very\u00a0 jurisdiction over them.<\/p><p>Nor is the plaintiff in any position\u00a0 to ask for favors. It is\u00a0 clearly\u00a0 guilty of gross negligence in the allegations of its complaint, if the land does not lie\u00a0 in Tarlac as\u00a0 it now asserts.\u00a0 It alleged in its complaint:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"4.\u00a0 That,\u00a0 according\u00a0 to the information\u00a0 secured after a minute investigation in the offices of the land registry\u00a0 and of the land-tax record\u00a0 of the municipalities within whose jurisdiction lie all the parcels composing the tract of land in question,\u00a0 the\u00a0 owners and occupants\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 same, with their names as they appear on the plan, are as follows.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>At\u00a0 the time it commenced the action it was possessed of every fact which a\u00a0 complete knowledge of the location of the lands\u00a0 sought to be condemned required.\u00a0 It had the map of its entire line from Paniqui to Tayug, showing the <em> provinces<\/em> and the various municipalities through which\u00a0 it runs.\u00a0 Not only\u00a0 that:\u00a0 Before beginning its action\u00a0 it\u00a0 had to know the name of every necessary defendant, the land he owned, and the extent of that portion to be condemned.

We have delayed until this moment the citation of authorities relative to the proposition that venue is\u00a0 not jurisdictional as to subject matter\u00a0 and that defendant's rights in respect thereto are such that they may be waived, expressly or by implication, for the reason that We desired that the principles which rule\u00a0 the case\u00a0 should first be discussed and presented\u00a0 in\u00a0 the abstract form.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 the\u00a0 case of First National Bank of Charlotte <em>vs.<\/em> Morgan (132 U. S., 141), it was held that\u00a0 the exemption of national banks from suits\u00a0 in State courts\u00a0 in counties\u00a0 other than\u00a0 the\u00a0 county or city\u00a0 in which the association was located was a\u00a0 personal privilege which could be waived by appearing in such\u00a0 suit brought in another county, <em>but in a\u00a0 court of\u00a0 the same\u00a0 dignity,<\/em> and making a defense without claiming\u00a0 the immunity granted by Congress.\u00a0 The\u00a0 court said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"This exemption\u00a0 of national banking\u00a0 associations from suits in State courts, established elsewhere than in the county or city in which such associations were located, was, we do not doubt, prescribed for the convenience of those institutions, and to prevent interruption\u00a0 in\u00a0 their business that might result from their books being sent to distant counties in obedience to process from State courts.\u00a0\u00a0 (First\u00a0 Nat. Bank of Bethel vs. National Pahquioque Bank, 14 Wall., 383, 394; Crocker <em>vs<\/em>. Marine Nat. Bank, 101 Mass., 240.) But, without indulging in conjecture as to the object of the exemption in question,\u00a0 it is sufficient that it was granted by Congress, and,\u00a0 if it had been\u00a0 claimed by the defendant when appearing in the superior court of Cleveland County, must have been recognized.\u00a0 The defendant\u00a0 did not, however, choose to claim immunity\u00a0 from\u00a0 suit in\u00a0 that court. It made defense upon the merits, and,\u00a0 having been\u00a0 unsuccessful, prosecuted a writ of error to the supreme court of the\u00a0 State, and in\u00a0 the latter tribunal,\u00a0 for the first time, claimed the immunity granted to\u00a0 it by Congress.\u00a0 This was too late.\u00a0 Considering the object as well as the words of the\u00a0 statute authorizing suit against a national\u00a0 banking association to be brought in the\u00a0 proper State court of the county where it is located, we are of opinion that its exemption from suits in other courts\u00a0 of the same State was a personal privilege that it would\u00a0 waive, and, which, in this\u00a0 case,\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 did waive,\u00a0 by appearing and making defense without\u00a0 claiming the immunity granted by Congress.\u00a0 No reason can be\u00a0 suggested why one court of a State, rather than another, both\u00a0 being of the same dignity, should take cognizance of a\u00a0 suit against a national bank, except the convenience of\u00a0 the bank.\u00a0 And this consideration\u00a0 supports the view that\u00a0 the exemption\u00a0 of a national bank from suit in any State court except one of the county or city in which it is located\u00a0 is a personal privilege, which it could claim or not, as it deemed necessary.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In the case of <em>Ex parte<\/em> Schollenberger (96 U.

Such, for example, are the prohibition against multiplicity of actions, the rule against division\u00a0 of actions Into parts, and the general principle that jurisdiction over a\u00a0 subject matter\u00a0 singly owned will not\u00a0 be divided among different courts,\u00a0 the one in which the action is first brought having exclusive jurisdiction of the whole.\u00a0 The provisions of these two laws, section 377 and Act No. 1258, differ in the manner indicated\u00a0 because\u00a0 they refer to\u00a0 subjects\u00a0 requiring inherently different\u00a0 treatment, so different,\u00a0 in fact, as to be in some respects quite opposite.\u00a0 While it is true that section 377 speaks of actions for the condemnation of real estate, neverthless\u00a0 it was intended to cover simply\u00a0 the ordinary\u00a0 action affecting title to or interest in real estate, where\u00a0 the\u00a0 land involved\u00a0 is comparatively speaking, compact together.\u00a0\u00a0 Its provisions\u00a0 were not\u00a0 intended to meet a situation presented\u00a0 by an action to condemn lands extending contiguously from one end of the country to the other.\u00a0\u00a0 Act No, 1258 is a special law, enacted for a particular\u00a0 purpose, and to meet a particular exigency.\u00a0 The conditions found in an action for the condemnation\u00a0 of real estate by a railroad company\u00a0 might and generally would be\u00a0 so different\u00a0 that the application of the provisions of section\u00a0 377 permitting the venue to be laid in any province where <em>any\u00a0 part<\/em> of the\u00a0 land lies would work\u00a0 a very great hardship to many defendants in\u00a0 such an action.\u00a0 To\u00a0 hold that a railroad company desiring to build a line from Ilocos Norte to Batangas, through substantially the whole of the Island of Luzon, might lay the venue in Batangas, it being a\u00a0 province\u00a0 in which a part of the land described in the complaint was located, would be to require all the parties defendant in Ilocos Norte and intervening provinces,\u00a0 with their witnesses,\u00a0 to\u00a0 go to Batangas,\u00a0 with all\u00a0 the inconvenience and expense\u00a0 which\u00a0 that\u00a0 journey would entail, and submit the valuation of their\u00a0 lands not only to the Court of First Instance of Batangas but to a commission appointed in that province.\u00a0 The hardship to such defendants under\u00a0 such\u00a0 a holding is so manifest that we are of the opinion that it was not intended that\u00a0 section 377 of the Code\u00a0 of Civil Procedure should apply to actions for condemnation.\u00a0 Under the provisions of that section, the defendant has no right to ask for a change of venue if the land involved in\u00a0 the litigation,\u00a0 <em>or any part\u00a0 thereof<\/em>, is located in the province where the court sits before which the action\u00a0 has been commenced.\u00a0\u00a0 When, therefore, an action such as is detailed above is begun by a railroad company in Batangas\u00a0 against persons whose lands lie in Ilocos Norte, there being also involved lands lying in Batangas,\u00a0 such defendants\u00a0 would have no right under section 377,\u00a0 if it were applicable, to demand that the trial as to their lands take place in the Province\u00a0 of\u00a0 Ilocos Norte.\u00a0 We do not believe\u00a0 that this was\u00a0 intended.\u00a0 We believe, rather,\u00a0 that under the provisions of the special laws relating to the condemnation of real\u00a0 estate by railroad companies,\u00a0 the defendants in the various provinces through which the line runs may compel, if they wish, a separate action to be\u00a0 commenced in each province in\u00a0 order that they may have a fair and convenient trial not\u00a0 only before the\u00a0 court but also before\u00a0 commissioners of their province\u00a0 who are\u00a0 not\u00a0 only conveniently at hand, but who are best able to judge of the weight\u00a0 of testimony relative to the value of land in\u00a0 that province.<\/p><p>We, therefore, hold that section 377 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not applicable to actions by railroad\u00a0 corporations to condemn lands; and that, while with the consent of defendants express or implied the venue may be laid and the action tried in any province selected by the plaintiff, nevertheless the defendants whose lands lie in one province, or any one of\u00a0 such defendants, may, by timely application to the court, require the venue as to their, or, if one defendant, his, lands to be changed to the province where their or his lands lie.\u00a0 In such case the action as to all of the defendants not objecting would continue in the province where originally begun.\u00a0 It would be severed as to\u00a0 the objecting defendants\u00a0 and ordered continued before the court of the appropriate\u00a0 province or provinces.\u00a0\u00a0 While we are of that opinion and so hold it can not affect the decision in the case before us for the reason that the defendants are not objecting to the venue and are not asking for a change thereof.\u00a0 They have not only expressly submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the court but are here asking that that jurisdiction\u00a0 be maintained against the efforts of the plaintiff to remove it.<\/p><p>The principles which we have herein\u00a0 laid down we do not apply to criminal cases.\u00a0\u00a0 They seem to rest on\u00a0 a different footing.\u00a0\u00a0 There the people of the state\u00a0 is a party. The interests of the public require that, to secure the best results and effects in the punishment of crime,\u00a0 it is necessary to prosecute and punish the criminal in the very place, as near\u00a0 as may be, where he committed\u00a0 his crime.\u00a0 As a result it has been the uniform legislation, both in statutes and in constitutions, that the\u00a0 venue of a criminal action must be\u00a0 laid in the place where the crime was\u00a0 committed. While the laws here do not specifically and in terms require it, we believe it is the established custom and the uniform holding that criminal prosecutions\u00a0 must\u00a0 be brought and conducted, except in\u00a0 cases especially provided\u00a0 by law, in the province where the crime is committed.<\/p><p>For these reasons the judgment below must be reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court with direction to proceed with the action according to law.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson<\/em>, and <em>Trent, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

FELICIANO BREDEJO  AND RUFINO AUDALES, DEFENDANTS; FELICIANO BREDEJO, APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">Feliciano Bredejo, the appellant in this cause, is charged with having killed Cornelio Pilapil by inflicting upon him two wounds in his back, with a dagger, at a\u00a0 moment when the\u00a0 latter, who was entirely\u00a0 unwarned, was climbing the stairs\u00a0 of Ambrosio\u00a0 Medina's house.\u00a0\u00a0 As\u00a0 a\u00a0 result\u00a0 of the wounds, which were 3 to 4 inches in depth, the victim fell lifeless to the ground.<p>At 5 o'clock one afternoon Juan Niunay and Feliciano Bredejo engaged in an altercation over a wager on a cockfight;\u00a0 Bredejo denied that the\u00a0 bet had been\u00a0 made\u00a0 and refused to pay; Niunay became\u00a0 quiet, and each went his way.\u00a0 At 7 o'clock that evening\u00a0 Bredejo returned to Niunay's store,\u00a0 near the cockpit,\u00a0 and again brought\u00a0 .up the matter of the wager.\u00a0\u00a0 Evaristo Tudtud was present at the time and confirmed the fact that the bet had been made; thereupon\u00a0 Bredejo, hearing\u00a0 this, turned against\u00a0 Tudtud and struck at\u00a0 him with a dagger, which\u00a0 he\u00a0 was\u00a0 able to avoid, but Bredejo immediately made another thrust at him which, owing to Tudtud's speedy\u00a0 flight, did him no injury, and only tore\u00a0 his shirt.\u00a0 Bredejo ran after\u00a0 Tudtud,\u00a0 but could not overtake him; he then returned to the place from which he had\u00a0 started\u00a0 and assaulted Niunay who at first defended himself with a cane, with which he succeeded in hitting Bredejo on the nose, but,\u00a0 as the latter\u00a0 renewed the assault Niunay also took to flight\u00a0 and was pursued by Bredejo for about 30 brazas before he gave\u00a0 up the chase and again returned to the place of\u00a0 the attack.<\/p><p>At this juncture, Cornelio Pilapil, who had been sleeping in\u00a0 Ambrosio\u00a0 Medina's\u00a0 store,\u00a0 was awakened\u00a0 and\u00a0 being advised of what was taking place, got up and, taking a light, started to climb to the upper floor of Medina's house; just then Bredejo rushed up excitedly\u00a0 and at the moment when Pilapil was placing his\u00a0 foot on the first step of the stair, Bredejo struck him in\u00a0 the back\u00a0 with a dagger and,\u00a0 \"as the defendant was zurdo\u00a0 (left handed), when the first blow was struck, and as Pilapil was about to fall, the defendant gave him another blow with the dagger in the\u00a0 same place; it was at this moment that he fell face downwards.\"\u00a0 (Trial record,\u00a0 p.\u00a0 19.)\u00a0 Thereupon\u00a0 the defendant dared Medina to come down and ascended the steps,\u00a0 but on\u00a0 reaching the last step of the stairs, as Medina and\u00a0 those\u00a0 living in the house had climbed up into the loft, Bredejo descended, shouting that he would kill all of them, especially Niunay's family.\u00a0 Such are the facts.<\/p><p>The fact that the defendant is zurdo, or left-handed, and that\u00a0 Pilapil was not a resident\u00a0 of Medina's\u00a0 house, apparently explains the phrase found in the decision\u00a0 of the lower court, to wit, that the\u00a0 deceased was \"a stranger and, besides, deaf\u00a0 (<em>sordo<\/em>)\"\u00a0 (record, p.\u00a0 4)\u00a0 circumstances, however, which can have no weight in passing judgment upon the\u00a0 criminal\u00a0 acts,\u00a0 as a\u00a0 whole.\u00a0 Although the evidence clearly shows that Bredejo violated\u00a0 another's domicile, the private residence of Medina, where Pilapil\u00a0 was enjoying the confidence and abandon one\u00a0 naturally feels in the place he has chosen to rest and whither, moreover, he had gone to escape that criminal's fury,\u00a0 yet the criminal law requires, in order to consider this circumstance as an aggravating one,\u00a0 that\u00a0 the crime\u00a0 should\u00a0 have been\u00a0 committed in the offended party's\u00a0 dwelling,\u00a0 and Medina does not figure in this cause\u00a0 as an offended party, nor does it in any manner appear that Medina's house was the dwelling of the offended party, Pilapil. <\/p><p>The crime perpetrated by\u00a0 the appellant was duly\u00a0 classified by the trial\u00a0 judge as consummated murder, owing to the circumstance\u00a0 of treachery attending its commission and in regard. to which no question has been raised.<\/p><p>The penalty for the crime\u00a0 of murder is <em>cadena temporal<\/em> from its maximum degree to\u00a0 death.\u00a0 (Penal Code, art. 403, par. 2.)\u00a0 As this punishment is divided\u00a0 into three distinct parts, which\u00a0 are\u00a0 <em>cadena temporal,\u00a0 cadena perpetua,<\/em> and death, each of which\u00a0 form\u00a0 a\u00a0 separate grade\u00a0 (id., art. 97), the minimum\u00a0 penalty should\u00a0 be imposed only when a mitigating circumstance alone\u00a0 is present,\u00a0 but if there concur both aggravating and mitigating circumstances they should be reasonably balanced in fixing the penalty\u00a0 (id., art. 81).<\/p><p>In\u00a0 the sentence imposed,\u00a0 only one extenuating circumstance was considered in conjunction with that of article 11, to wit, non-habitual drunkenness,\u00a0 together\u00a0 with that of race,\u00a0 the penalty\u00a0 was imposed\u00a0 in\u00a0 its medium degree, while it should, in such a\u00a0 case,\u00a0 have been applied in the minimum degree.<\/p><p>However, in the opinion of this court, the penalty is properly applied,\u00a0 for the reason that, in considering the\u00a0 commission of the crime, account should have been taken of the fact of its being perpetrated at night, a circumstance which, according to the proofs, was not inherent in that of treachery; and as that aggravating circumstance should be considered separately, it is to be offset by the aforesaid extenuating one\u00a0 and the penalty\u00a0 must\u00a0 be applied in the medium degree.<\/p><p>Therefore, the judgment\u00a0 appealed from is affirmed,\u00a0 with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Moreland<\/em>, and <em>Trent, JJ<\/em>.,concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Their brief in this case discusses\u00a0 the evidence\u00a0 of record and the case made by them in the court below, substantially as though\u00a0 no dismissing order had ever been entered, and indeed it seems to have been treated both in the court\u00a0 below and in the proceedings on this appeal, as though it were no more than a mere order closing the trial in the court below in due form.<br\/><br\/>As to the orders declining to extend the time\u00a0 in which the\u00a0 plans\u00a0 in question were\u00a0 ordered\u00a0 to be submitted,\u00a0 and declining to grant a new trial to give the objectors an opportunity\u00a0 to introduce such\u00a0 plans, it might,\u00a0 perhaps, be sufficient to say that such orders were\u00a0 peculiarly\u00a0 in\u00a0 the discretion\u00a0 of the trial court,\u00a0 and in the absence of proof of abuse of this discretion, they were not subject to exception. We may observe further, however, that the opposition\u00a0 had in fact rested its case and submitted its evidence some time before these plans were\u00a0 called for, so that it could\u00a0 hardly complain if no opportunity had ever been given to produce these plans.\u00a0 Still less is there a well-founded source of complaint merely because, as appellants allege, the time was not long enough; and in truth, it is very clear from the evidence regularly introduced at\u00a0 the\u00a0 trial,\u00a0 that the production of these plans could in no wise\u00a0 have affected the result.\u00a0 The precise location of the various tracts of land claimed by the appellants\u00a0 by relation one to\u00a0 another, could, in no\u00a0 aspect of the\u00a0 case, have\u00a0 any effect on the judgment rendered in favor of the applicant for the registry of the entire tract; and\u00a0 assuming that these plans were actually in the record, and before us on this appeal,\u00a0 it would still be incumbent on us to affirm the judgment of the\u00a0 court below\u00a0 on grounds wholly independent of the location\u00a0 within the\u00a0 principal tract of\u00a0 the various parcels of land claimed\u00a0 by the\u00a0 objectors.\u00a0\u00a0 Clearly a final\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 should not\u00a0 be\u00a0 reversed merely to give parties an opportunity to introduce evidence which could in no\u00a0 wise affect\u00a0 the judgment already rendered.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below\u00a0 should be and is\u00a0 affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

That the present action is an action <i>ex delicto<\/i> and not an action <i>ex\u00a0 contractu<\/i>, and that the defendant is\u00a0 liable to the plaintiff in damages, if the proof shows that the latter has been injured by reason of the negligence of the former.<br\/><br\/>Second.

Judge P. M. Moir.<p>Between 8 and 9 o'clock on the morning of the 3d of May, 1910, the\u00a0 Chinaman, Go Sui Chiang, a resident of the pueblo of Bacacay, Albay,\u00a0 heard\u00a0 that, in the maritime fishing zone comprised within the concession obtained by him, there were several men engaged in\u00a0 fishing by means of a hoop net; he therefore got into a small boat, or <em>baroto,<\/em> and went to\u00a0 the point indicated, and when he reached a place where there was a depth of about 3 varas of water, he\u00a0 was approached by\u00a0 Luis Bien in his <em>baroto<\/em>.\u00a0 Chiang then told Bien to cease fishing and leave\u00a0 the place, whereupon the\u00a0 latter\u00a0 caught hold of the\u00a0 Chinaman and threw him into the\u00a0 water.\u00a0\u00a0 As Chiang could not swim, he made efforts to keep himself afloat until finally he succeeded in seizing the gunwale of the boat in\u00a0 which he had come; and while one of the companions of the defendant\u00a0 told the latter to submerge the Chinaman at a place where the water was deeper, Camilo Bas and\u00a0 Victorino Bas, whose attention had been attracted to the spot by the Chinaman's cries for help, arrived on the\u00a0 scene and\u00a0 prevented the defendant from striking\u00a0 the victim of the attack with an oar and took him to\u00a0 the shore.\u00a0 Chiang then immediately went to the lieutenant of the barrio, before whom he presented himself\u00a0 with\u00a0 his\u00a0 clothes wet,\u00a0 and reported\u00a0 that the defendant had thrown\u00a0 him into the water with\u00a0 the intention of drowning him.<\/p><p>Subsequently, on September 20 of the same year,\u00a0 the provincial fiscal filed a complaint against the accused, Luis Bien, charging him with the crime of frustrated homicide; and the court, upon the evidence adduced, rendered judgment on the following 8th of\u00a0 November\u00a0 and sentenced the defendant to the penalty of six years and one of <em>prision mayor<\/em> and to the payment of the costs, from which judgment he appealed. <\/p><p>From the foregoing facts, which were duly proved at the trial, it is concluded that the crime\u00a0 of attempted homicide against the person of the Chinaman, Go Sui Chiang, was actually committed, for the said Chinaman was thrown into the water, where he was exposed to asphyxia through submersion, as he\u00a0 did\u00a0 not know\u00a0 how to swim,\u00a0 and it\u00a0 is therefore unquestionable that the assailant commenced the commission of the crime directly by overt acts; if the death of the party attacked was not consummated, it was because of\u00a0 the opportune intervention of two\u00a0 witnesses\u00a0 who responded to the cries of the Chinaman when he was sinking and helped\u00a0 him to\u00a0 get out of the water and to reach the land;\u00a0 hence, it may not be\u00a0 said that the crime\u00a0 was not consummated because of any voluntary and spontaneous desistance on the part of the\u00a0 aggressor; consequently the crime\u00a0 under prosecution should be technically classified as attempted homicide, provided for\u00a0 and punished by article 404, in connection\u00a0 with article 3, second\u00a0 paragraph, and article 66, of the Penal\u00a0 Code.<\/p><p>The defendant Luis\u00a0 Bien,\u00a0 is the sole\u00a0 perpetrator, by direct participation, and fully convicted of the homicidal attempt\u00a0 charged\u00a0 against him; notwithstanding\u00a0 his denial and his plea of not guilty, the record shows decisive and conclusive\u00a0 proof\u00a0 of his guilt in\u00a0 having thrown the said Chinaman into the\u00a0 water, the latter\u00a0 being unable to swim, and of his having further attempted, by the use of an oar, to loosen the victim's hold upon the boat; and if the latter was finally saved, it was due to the\u00a0 assistance of two eyewitnesses who responded to his call for help and took him to the land where\u00a0 he afterwards\u00a0 presented himself,\u00a0 with his clothes thoroughly drenched,\u00a0 to the lieutenant of the barrio to report what had occurred to him; this\u00a0 particular was confirmed by the said lieutenant.<\/p><p>The two witnesses presented by the defense testified that the Chinaman did, on the morning of the crime, appear at the place where there were fishing nets set in the Bay\u00a0 of Bacacay and where they were engaged in fishing; that he inquired as\u00a0 to the ownership of the\u00a0 net which was placed there and,\u00a0 on learning that it belonged to the defendant,\u00a0 Luis Bien, he approached the latter in his boat and immediately got into that where the defendant was; that they did not see what afterwards transpired; and that the Chinaman left\u00a0 his boat floating- on\u00a0 the\u00a0 water and returned to the land,\u00a0 without getting wet.\u00a0 These statements were belied entirely at the trial by the testimony of the two wit- nesses who helped the Chinaman out of the water and took him to land, thoroughly drenched; also by the testimony of the lieutenant of the barrio before whom the said Chinaman immediately appeared for the purpose of making complaint.<\/p><p>True enough, the\u00a0 witnesses for the prosecution did not see the\u00a0 defendant throw the offended Chinaman into the water, for when they came up to him, in response to his cries, they found him already in the water and holding on to the gunwale of the boat; but it is no less true that neither the defendant nor his witnesses could explain how and in what manner the said Chinaman fell into the water.\u00a0 Therefore, because of the lack of\u00a0 evidence to the contrary, the charge must be admitted as true, for it can not be believed that the Chinaman, with no reason whatever and not knowing how to swim, should have jumped into the water.\u00a0 On the other\u00a0 hand, it was not proven that his fall was due to an accident, but, according to the prosecution,\u00a0 to the criminal act of the defendant, performed\u00a0 with the unquestionable purpose of doing harm to the\u00a0 offended party who, justly angered at the time, was reproaching the defendant because the latter\u00a0 had proceeded to\u00a0 fish in\u00a0 the\u00a0 place where the offended party had obtained, from\u00a0 competent\u00a0 authority,\u00a0 a license to engage in fishing.<\/p><p>In the commission of the crime, there is no\u00a0 aggravating circumstance whatever\u00a0 to be taken into account, but due weight must be given to the special circumstance of article 11\u00a0 of the Penal Code,\u00a0 in view of\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 being\u00a0 a native, the nature of the act committed, and his scant education ;

Marriage contracts, and the creation and increase of dowries, whenever\u00a0 it is\u00a0 intended\u00a0 to\u00a0 enforce them\u00a0 against third persons.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From\u00a0 this the appellant makes the deduction that\u00a0 the creation\u00a0 of a dowry is valid and effective among the same parties who\u00a0 intervened\u00a0 therein, without need of a public instrument.\u00a0 As\u00a0 may be seen, the appellant's argument is based on a mere inference, and not on the language of the law.\u00a0 Opposed to this inference, there are categorical and definite legal provisions which destroy it completely.\u00a0 Thus, for example, with respect to marriage contracts, there is article 1321 of the Civil\u00a0 Code, which\u00a0 prescribes that \"marriage contracts\u00a0 and modifications\u00a0 made\u00a0 therein <i>must\u00a0 be contained in a public instrument<\/i> executed before the celebration of the marriage.\"<br\/><br\/>Explaining the meaning and scope of this article, Manresa, in\u00a0 his\u00a0 Commentaries on\u00a0 the\u00a0 Civil Code,\u00a0 says\u00a0 that \"marriage\u00a0 contracts contained in private documents have no force whatever, <i>either between the parties<\/i> or as regards third parties\"\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 \"It is not enough, then,\" he adds in another part of\u00a0 the same Commentaries, \"that\u00a0 the act be recorded in writing, even in a public document; a public instrument, executed\u00a0 before a notary, is\u00a0 absolutely necessary.\"<br\/><br\/>And Mucius\u00a0 Scsevola says,\u00a0 in\u00a0 commenting on the\u00a0 said article 1280, in\u00a0 connection with article 1321:<br\/><blockquote>\"The deduction appears to be made from the rule of the code that when\u00a0 it is not intended to enforce the said\u00a0 contracts (marriage contracts, creation and increase of\u00a0 dowry) against third persons, the formality of an instrument\u00a0 may be dispensed with;\u00a0 but,\u00a0 aside from the fact that\u00a0 the expression is absolutely incorrect, because reference was made to the intention, which implies a general protective measure for third parties, we find that article\u00a0 1321, without\u00a0 any distinction whatever <i>between\u00a0 prejudice\u00a0 and no\u00a0 prejudice to third persons<\/i>, directs that marriage contracts and modifications made therein must be contained in a public instrument executed before the celebration of the marriage.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Restricting the discussion to the dowry, it has already been herein before shown that its creation is subject to the rules governing gifts, and that one of these rules, established by article 633 of the Civil Code, requires the execution of a\u00a0 public instrument to validate the gift of real property and, therefore,\u00a0 likewise the\u00a0 creation of\u00a0 a\u00a0 dowry when it consists of real\u00a0 property.<br\/><br\/>In his commentary on the said article 633,\u00a0 Manresa\u00a0 lays down the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"The gift of real property is valid only when made by a public instrument.\u00a0 The framers of the Civil Code did not believe that sufficient force would be given to such\u00a0 a\u00a0 gift by article 1280,\u00a0 according to which,\u00a0 acts and contracts, the object of which is the transmission of property rights, must appear in\u00a0 a public\u00a0 instrument,\u00a0 because article 633 does not require any\u00a0 special\u00a0 formality with which the\u00a0 contracting parties may compel each other\u00a0 to\u00a0 comply,\u00a0 when once they have validly bound themselves\u00a0 to fulfill the obligation (article 1279), but the <i>validity of the gift is made to depend upon that formality.\"<\/i><br\/><\/blockquote>The same author, in another part of his work, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Article 633 provides, in order that a gift of real property may be valid, that it must be made by a public\u00a0 instrument\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 can not be\u00a0 denied\u00a0 that the law\u00a0 requires a public instrument as a necessary requisite for validity, not as a mere formality or as a probatory document\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *, because if it could\u00a0 be\u00a0 dispensed\u00a0 with and the\u00a0 parties still be bound, at all events, in any form, the requirement would be ridiculous; a requirement which the law deems necessary for validity could be dispensed with, or,\u00a0 what amounts to the same thing, there would be no such necessity, nor would the instrument have any bearing whatever in\u00a0 the matter of the origin and force of the obligation\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\u00a0 It is not a question of form (he concludes), it is a question of substance.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>To the same extent that a public instrument\u00a0 is required for the validity\u00a0 of\u00a0 a gift, it is necessary for the creation of a dowry consisting of real property, even for those who execute it.<br\/><br\/>It is also maintained by the appellant that the plaintiffs are barred from challenging the validity of the\u00a0 creation of the dowry here\u00a0 in question,\u00a0 on account\u00a0 of their having consented to its\u00a0 creation and taken a direct part therein by\u00a0 signing the\u00a0 instrument in which\u00a0 a\u00a0 record\u00a0 was\u00a0 made of the conveyance\u00a0 of the\u00a0 land as\u00a0 a dowry to\u00a0 their stepmother, Maria Soratos; but,\u00a0 as the judge well\u00a0 says in\u00a0 the judgment appealed\u00a0 from, an\u00a0 instrument creates no impediment when\u00a0 it\u00a0 is\u00a0 a violation of a\u00a0 positive\u00a0 requirement established with reference to its\u00a0 validity and the\u00a0 form of its execution. This doctrine\u00a0 is recognized\u00a0\u00a0 as true by the appellant himself;\u00a0 he says in his brief that \"it is true that no impediment exists in an instrument when the instrument\u00a0 is\u00a0 null and\u00a0 void.\"\u00a0 And\u00a0 the\u00a0 private document subscribed by the plaintiffs, considered as an instrument of dowry, is in fact null, void, and ineffective.<br\/><br\/>The judgment\u00a0 appealed from\u00a0 is affirmed, with the costs of this instance\u00a0 against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Under all the circumstances we do not think that the evidence\u00a0 sustains a finding that Juarez executed the alleged written contract or that he entered into any agreement to sell or release the property in\u00a0 question to the defendant municipality.<br\/><br\/>It is not\u00a0 improbable,\u00a0 however, that\u00a0 Juarez consented\u00a0 or at least did not offer any objection to the temporary occupation of his house by the municipality, pending the settlement of his claim for relief from the\u00a0 responsibility for the alleged shortage, and we think the weight of the evidence fairly sustains a finding to that effect.\u00a0\u00a0 The precise terms and conditions upon\u00a0 which the\u00a0 municipality took\u00a0 possession do\u00a0 not appear from the evidence,\u00a0 but we\u00a0 are\u00a0 well satisfied that it had no right to remain in possession against the wishes of the owner, after the levy of attachment\u00a0 (<i>embargo<\/i>) had lost\u00a0 its force.\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence\u00a0 does not satisfactorily establish the date when this took place, though there can be no doubt that it occurred long prior to the\u00a0 formal extrajudicial demand for possession which it appears was fruitlessly\u00a0 made upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant by the\u00a0 owners of the property not later than the 31st of December, 1902.\u00a0 Plaintiffs are, therefore, clearly entitled to a judgment for possession of the premises described in the complaint,\u00a0 and to damages for the illegal detention thereof since the 1st day of January, 1903.<br\/><br\/>On the question of\u00a0 the\u00a0 amount\u00a0 of damages we\u00a0 do not think there is sufficient evidence in the record to support a judgment in this court for a specific amount in favor of the plaintiffs.\u00a0 The evidence. wholly fails to\u00a0 establish the allegations as to damages, other than the loss of the rental value of\u00a0 the building throughout the period of its proven illegal occupation by the defendant.\u00a0 There is some formal evidence\u00a0 to\u00a0 the effect that\u00a0 the rental value of the building at the time\u00a0 when the action was tried was P30 per month, but we do not think that this evidence is sufficient to sustain a judgment for\u00a0 that amount throughout\u00a0 the entire\u00a0 period of illegal occupation.\u00a0\u00a0 As the judgment must be\u00a0 reversed we think that, in the interests of justice, the\u00a0 parties should have a further opportunity to present\u00a0 evidence as\u00a0 to the true rental value of the building during this period.<br\/><br\/>Twenty days hereafter let judgment be\u00a0 entered reversing the judgment of the trial\u00a0 court, without cosis to either party in this instance, and ten days thereafter let the record be returned to the court\u00a0 below where\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 will\u00a0 be entered in\u00a0 favor\u00a0 of the\u00a0 plaintiffs\u00a0 for possession\u00a0 of\u00a0 the premises described in the\u00a0 complaint and for\u00a0 damages\u00a0 for the\u00a0 unlawful\u00a0 detention thereof\u00a0 since January 1, 1903;\u00a0 the amount of the damages,\u00a0 however, to be strictly limited to the\u00a0 fair rental value\u00a0 of the premises\u00a0 since that date,\u00a0 as fixed by the court, after giving both parties\u00a0 an opportunity to present\u00a0 witnesses and to be heard on this question.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

nor dispose of, mortgage, or encumber any of the\u00a0 properties described in the complaint;\u00a0 that\u00a0 the defendant received\u00a0 no\u00a0 sum whatever\u00a0 from\u00a0 the plaintiff nor was he in the\u00a0 latter's debt for the amount claimed in\u00a0 the complaint, nor for any other sum of money; that he did not give his consent to all or to any one of the mortgages alleged in the\u00a0 complaint, and that all\u00a0 the said mortgages on the properties therein mentioned were founded on a supposed power of attorney said\u00a0 to have been executed by\u00a0 the defendant in favor\u00a0 of Vicente Marcelo Concepcion, which power\u00a0 of attorney was fictitious, false, fraudulent, null and void,\u00a0 that it was not executed by the defendant, nor did the latter intervene there in and that the said power of attorney had no true reason for existence; wjherefore the\u00a0 defendant asked that judgment be rendered absolving\u00a0 him from the complaint with the costs\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 against the plaintiff, by annulling each and all of the mortgages alleged in the complaint and the inscription of each of them in the office of the register of property of Tayabas, and by ordering the cancellation of all the inscriptions of the said mortgages and encumbrances on the aforementioned properties.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, in answer to the countercomplaint, set up a general and specific denial of each and all of the allegations of the defendant with respect to each and all of the actions brought by\u00a0 him in each and\u00a0 all\u00a0 of the paragraphs of the countercomplaint, and prayed that judgment be pronounced in his favor,\u00a0 and against the defendant, in conformity with the petitions made in his complaint.<br\/><br\/>The case\u00a0 came up for hearing on November 30, 1908, and after the presentation of oral evidence by both parties, the documentary evidence\u00a0 being attached to\u00a0 the record, the court, on December 15 of the\u00a0 same year, rendered judgment whereby it\u00a0 directed that the\u00a0 plaintiff should recover from the defendant the sum specified in the first instrument of mortgage, P3,302.50, as principal,\u00a0 the additional sum of P385.57 as interest up to April 30, 1908, besides the interest on the said principal, at the rate of 8 per cent\u00a0 per annum from the date just above mentioned until its\u00a0 complete payment, also the P500 stipulated in\u00a0 the said instrument as payable by the defendant as costs and expenses in case of litigation; and the sum mentioned in the second\u00a0 instrument of mortgage,\u00a0 P5,213.15\u00a0 as\u00a0 principal, besides P503.79,\u00a0 as interest up to the 30th day of April, 1908, in addition to the interest on the said principal\u00a0 at the rate\u00a0 of 8 per cent per annum, from the\u00a0 date just above mentioned\u00a0 until its complete payment, and the sum of 1*174.95, as expenses for the execution of the instrument, for its inscription, cancellation, and acquittance, as provided\u00a0 for in clause 17 of the said instrument, and the additional sum of P600, which\u00a0 it was stipulated in the\u00a0 second instrument the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 should pay for costs and expenses in case of litigation.\u00a0 The judgment further ordered\u00a0 that\u00a0 the defendant should pay the several\u00a0 amounts above mentioned, with\u00a0 the\u00a0 intei'est and costs, on or before the first day of the sitting of the court in April,\u00a0 1909, and that, in case such order should not be complied\u00a0 with, the mortgages should be foreclosed and a final writ should be issued directing that all the properties before described be sold, the proceeds of the sale to pay the principal, interest, and costs.\u00a0 The defendant, when notified of this judgment, took exception thereto,\u00a0 announced that he would file a bill of exceptions, and moved for a new trial on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the judgment rendered and that the latter was contrary to law.\u00a0 This motion was denied and exception was taken\u00a0 by the appellant, who filed the proper bill of exceptions, which was certified\u00a0 to,\u00a0 approved, and forwarded\u00a0 to the clerk of this court.\u00a0 By an order of March 1, 1909,\u00a0 it was provided that the execution of the aforesaid judgment should not be suspended pending the appeal, unless the defendant, for the reasons stated in the said order, should give a\u00a0 bond for P10,000.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of the suit filed by the plaintiff, W. W. Robinson, is the collection of various sums owed by the defendant, Marcelino Villafuerte y Ranola,\u00a0 the\u00a0 payment of which is secured by a mortgage on the real properties set out in the two notarial documents evidencing the debt,\u00a0 exhibited under letters A and B,\u00a0 and inscribed in the\u00a0 property\u00a0 registry of the Province of Tayabas.<br\/><br\/>The mortgage action brought by the creditor, based upon the two aforementioned notarial documents\u00a0 is proper, inasmuch as it is sought to collect certain sums\u00a0 specified in the said instruments\u00a0 on account of their not having been\u00a0 paid within the periods therein\u00a0 stipulated, and consequently the real properties offered as security for the solvency of the debts\u00a0 contracted by the debtor are duly liable for the satisfaction of the same;\u00a0 and although the credit of P3,852.50, the value\u00a0 of the\u00a0 flour furnished to Camilo C.\u00a0 Gomez,\u00a0 in account with the\u00a0 defendant, and referred to in the instrument lettered A, was to have been paid in four installments from\u00a0 October 19, 1906, at the rate of Pl,000 in\u00a0 each one of the three first months and P852.50 in the fourth and last month, yet since the debtor, notwithstanding, the demands made upon him, did not comply with his obligation nor pay his debt in conformity with the tenor of the said instrument, letter\u00a0 A, for he only paid the creditor\u00a0 the sum\u00a0 of P550 delivered partially on different dates, the default of payment of any of the installments agreed upon produces the effect that all of these must be deemed to have matured\u00a0 and entitles\u00a0 the creditor to demand the payment of his entire credit and\u00a0 to proceed against the mortgaged properties for the purpose of collecting his credit, which\u00a0 amounts to P3,302.50, after\u00a0 the deduction of the said\u00a0 P550 from the principal, with the interest due from the 6th of December, 1906, amounting to P385.57.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the credit mentioned in the\u00a0 instrument, Exhibit\u00a0 B, and granted by the plaintiff to the defendant Villafuerte under agreement\u00a0 that\u00a0 the latter should make use of the said credit by\u00a0 taking flour from the creditor's warehouse by means of written duebills or orders signed by the debtor, or his attorney in fact,\u00a0 under condition that the value or amount\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said duebills\u00a0 should\u00a0 be\u00a0 paid within thirty days from their date and that these acknowledgments of debt should bear interest of 8 per\u00a0 cent\u00a0 per annum from the date of their maturity, it was also a condition that the aforesaid instrument should be deemed to be retroactive in its effect, from November 20, 1906, that the quantities of flour\u00a0 which\u00a0 were taken from the plaintiff's warehouse since\u00a0 the said\u00a0 November\u00a0 20, 1906, should\u00a0 be considered as included, and that the total amount of whatever the defendant\u00a0 might owe,\u00a0 by reason of the credit mentioned, together with the interest thereon, should be settled and entirely paid on May\u00a0 20, 1907, on which date all\u00a0 the orders or duebills issued against the said credit should be deemed to have matured, even\u00a0 though the thirty\u00a0 days' delay stipulated should not have expired.<br\/><br\/>In view of the fact that the defendant succeeded in withdrawing flour to the value of P5,078.15, without his having paid the amount due therefor, except P375, it can not be denied that there still remains\u00a0 a balance to\u00a0 be\u00a0 paid of P4,703.15 (pp. 5 and 88 of the record).<br\/><br\/>In the account, Exhibit E, there appears a statement of the sacks of flour which were taken on account of\u00a0 the said credit\u00a0 by means of\u00a0 the nine duebills,\u00a0 Exhibit F, attached to the aforementioned account, in which it also appears that the value of the said sacks of flour was P4,703.15, after the deduction of P375.<br\/><br\/>The complaint which gave rise to the present suit is in accordance with the provisions of section 255\u00a0 of the Code of Civil\u00a0 Procedure,\u00a0 and the mortgages\u00a0 constituted in\u00a0 the two\u00a0 instruments aforementioned fulfill the conditions\u00a0 and requirements\u00a0 prescribed in articles 1857,\u00a0 1874, and 1875 of the Civil Code;\u00a0 wherefore judgment should be rendered favorable to the mortgage creditor, in\u00a0 accordance with\u00a0 section\u00a0 256, and\u00a0 following, of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>The defendant debtor denied the existence of the obligations contained in the said instruments; he asserted\u00a0 that the latter, and the\u00a0 powers of\u00a0 attorney executed\u00a0 in favor of Vicente Marcelo Concepcion were false, and likewise denied that he owed\u00a0 the plaintiff any of the amounts claimed in the complaint, or that he had authorized the said Concepcion to mortgage\u00a0 the realties\u00a0 described in the said complaint, and\u00a0 in asking for his release, he prayed that the aforementioned\u00a0 mortgages and the inscriptions of the\u00a0 same in the property registry be declared null and void.<br\/><br\/>If it is true, as it appears to be, that the defendant Marcelino Villafuerte y Ranola executed, on July 11 and\u00a0 October 29,\u00a0 1906, in this city,\u00a0 the powers of attorney,\u00a0 Exhibits C and D, in favor\u00a0 of Vicente Marcelo Concepcion, before\u00a0 the notaries\u00a0 Eugenio de\u00a0 Lara and Daniel\u00a0 R, Williams, respectively, it not having been proved at trial that the said powers of attorney were false or null and void, the mortgages upon the real properties, executed by the attorney in fact, duly authorized for the purpose, in the instruments designated under\u00a0 letters\u00a0 A and B,\u00a0 the first of them\u00a0 ratified in\u00a0 the notarial\u00a0 record,\u00a0 letter\u00a0 G, by the\u00a0 debtor before the same notary, Williams,\u00a0 must be accepted as valid and in\u00a0 force, inasmuch as the said mortgage deeds\u00a0 appear to\u00a0 have been ratified in due form by the contracting or interested parties before the said notary in Manila, it not having been proven at trial that they contained any flaw or defect which\u00a0 might operate to annul them.<br\/><br\/>The evidence adduced by the defendant in his attempt to prove\u00a0 that,\u00a0 on the two dates before mentioned, when the said two powers\u00a0 of attorney appear to have\u00a0 been executed,\u00a0 he was in Lucena, Tayabas, and not in this city of Manila, has not resulted in defeating\u00a0 the validity, authenticity,\u00a0 and force of the\u00a0 said powers\u00a0 of\u00a0 attorney, for the truth of their contents as\u00a0 well as their ratification by the person executing them was certified to by the notaries before whom\u00a0 they\u00a0 were exhibited respectively in the presence of two witnesses; the oral testimony presented by the defendant was insufficient to prove that the notaries Lara and Williams\u00a0 untruthfully certified that Marcelino Villafuerte, whom\u00a0 they attested\u00a0 under oath that they knew,\u00a0 personally appeared before\u00a0 them\u00a0 and\u00a0 ratified\u00a0 in its\u00a0 totality\u00a0 the contents of the aforementioned document, declaring that he ha.d executed it\u00a0 freely and voluntarily\u00a0 and exhibited for the purpose his\u00a0 cedula, No. 453963, issued in Lucena, Tayabas,\u00a0 on January 15, 1906.<br\/><br\/>In order to establish the conclusion, as the logical\u00a0 result of the evidence,\u00a0 that the\u00a0 said two notaries,\u00a0 falsely, and entirely\u00a0 irrespective of\u00a0 the\u00a0 truth,\u00a0 issued\u00a0 the certificates which\u00a0 appear under\u00a0 their respective signatures and seals at the foot of the powers of attorney, letters\u00a0 C and D, it\u00a0 is not sufficient to prove, by means of the testimony of witnesses, (mostly relatives) and by\u00a0 unauthenticated documents, that on the dates of the\u00a0 execution of the powers of attorney the person executing them was not\u00a0 here\u00a0 in Manila, where the instruments were certified to, but\u00a0 in Lucena, Tayabas; clear,\u00a0 strong, and\u00a0 irrefutable proof must\u00a0 be adduced\u00a0 to prove\u00a0 that the said notaries could not have averred that the said person was actually in their presence,\u00a0 that they heard\u00a0 him ratify the contents of the respective documents, and could not have certified\u00a0 to the number of his cedula, the\u00a0 only\u00a0 one exhibited\u00a0 to\u00a0 both notaries, without having ostensibly perverted the truth.\u00a0 The defendant\u00a0 himself, who averred that he was in Lucena on July 11, 1906, the date of the first power\u00a0 of attorney, said\u00a0 that he\u00a0 was not sure whether on\u00a0 October\u00a0 29 of the\u00a0 same year,\u00a0 the date of the second, he\u00a0 was in the\u00a0 said pueblo or\u00a0 in this city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>Public\u00a0 instruments\u00a0 authenticated by a notary\u00a0 or by a competent public official, with the formalities required\u00a0 by law, are evidence, even against a third person, of\u00a0 the fact which\u00a0 gives rise to their execution and of the date of the latter.\u00a0\u00a0 They\u00a0 shall also be evidence against the contracting parties and their legal representatives with\u00a0 regard to the declarations the former\u00a0 may have\u00a0 made\u00a0 therein.\u00a0\u00a0 (Arts. 1216 and\u00a0 1218, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>\"The force\u00a0 of proof of depositions of witnesses\u00a0 shall be weighed\u00a0 by the courts in accordance with the provisions of the law of civil procedure, taking care to avoid that, by the simple coincidence of\u00a0 some depositions, unless their truthfulness be evident,\u00a0 the affairs may be finally\u00a0 decided in which\u00a0 instruments, private documents,\u00a0 or any basis\u00a0 of written evidence are usually made use of.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Art, 1248, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 defendant debtor\u00a0 having\u00a0 been requested by letter,\u00a0 in the\u00a0 beginning of the year\u00a0 1907, to pay his debt, were it true that he had not contracted the obligations contained in the\u00a0 instruments lettered A and B, nor executed in favor of Vicente Marcelo the powers of attorney lettered C and D, would have at that time made the proper\u00a0 investigations and taken the necessary\u00a0 steps for the annulment or invalidation\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said instruments.\u00a0 The defendant\u00a0 did not even attempt\u00a0 to do anything of the kind, and we do not find\u00a0 any\u00a0 just reason nor any legal ground whatever\u00a0 to warrant\u00a0 a discussion of the conclusion arrived at by the lower\u00a0 court from his appreciation of the\u00a0 whole\u00a0 of the evidence presented in this suit,<br\/><br\/>Were it true that on the dates of the 11th of July and the 29th of October, 1906, the defendant Villafuerte was in Lucena, Tayabas,\u00a0 and not in Manila, it is not understood how two notaries who attested that they\u00a0 personally knew him could have\u00a0 certified that, on\u00a0 the\u00a0 respective dates aforementioned, the\u00a0 said\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 appeared in\u00a0 person before them, ratified\u00a0 the\u00a0 instrument of power of attorney which\u00a0 he had\u00a0 executed,\u00a0 and,\u00a0 to\u00a0 identify his personality, exhibited to the said notaries his certificate of registration, the only one\u00a0 and the\u00a0 same one which he presented at each of his\u00a0 appearances on the said\u00a0 dates.\u00a0 Without proof, nor rational, acceptable explanation, it is impossible to\u00a0 believe that the personal certificate of registration, which identifies a citizen,\u00a0 was for some four months in the\u00a0 possession of another person\u00a0 residing\u00a0 in\u00a0 a distant place.\u00a0 It\u00a0 was not proved in a\u00a0 satisfactory manner at the trial how or why the said cedula, or registration\u00a0 certificate, came to\u00a0 remain for so long a time in the possession\u00a0 of the Chinaman Sy Chuy Chim or of Vicente Marcelo, as averred by the defendant or his counsel, and under this supposition, so strange, anomalous, and\u00a0 out of the ordinary rule that every citizen should necessarily keep his\u00a0 certificate of\u00a0 identification in his possession, no explanation whatever was given\u00a0 by the defendant's counsel as to the purpose for which the defendant parted with his\u00a0 cedula and sent\u00a0 it to either the said Chinaman or Marcelo.\u00a0 The Chinaman was not examined in this litigation and the attorney in\u00a0 fact,\u00a0 Marcelo,\u00a0 denied that he had received the said cedula sent by his constituent. So\u00a0 that for the reasons hereinbefore stated, it'is\u00a0 evident that the defendant Villafuerte personally exhibited the said cedula to the two aforementioned notaries,\u00a0 on his ratification of the respective instrument\u00a0 of power of attorney before each one of them, and it is not permissible\u00a0 to conclude that the instruments of power of attorney executed by\u00a0 the defendant, as well as the\u00a0 certifications subscribed by the notaries Lara and Williams, are false, because of the absolute absence of proof as a foundation for such a charge; for a\u00a0 notarial document, guaranteed\u00a0 by public attestation in accordance with the law, must be\u00a0 sustained in\u00a0 full force and effect so long as he\u00a0 who\u00a0 impugns\u00a0 it shall\u00a0 not\u00a0 have presented\u00a0 strong,\u00a0 complete,\u00a0 and conclusive\u00a0 proof of\u00a0 its falsity or nullity on account of some flaw or defect provided against by law.<br\/><br\/>Although\u00a0 the documents\u00a0 exhibited by the defendant's counsel could not, for lack of proof of their authenticity, destroy or impair the value and force of the notarial documents or instruments on which the plaintiff's claim is based, it is, however, to be\u00a0 noted that\u00a0 Pedro Cantero, whose signature appears attached to the papers found on pages 159, 162, and 170, of the record, was not examined either, even for the purpose of\u00a0 identifying\u00a0 his signature, he being a\u00a0 Spaniard and an attorney it is\u00a0 not possible to believe that he wrote the aforementioned documents in the form and style in which they appear to have been\u00a0 drawn\u00a0 up; wherefore, on account of these\u00a0 circumstances, it is reasonable to\u00a0 presume that the documents of pages 159\u00a0 and 170, and the note of\u00a0 page 162, of the record, were not authentic. It is also to be observed, in the document or letter found on page 136 of\u00a0 the record, and which also was unauthenticated,\u00a0 that\u00a0 the aforementioned dates of the\u00a0 11th of July, 1906, appear therein with a correction, made in the proper place, of the figures 11\u00a0 and 6 of the first date, a repetition and details which induce the presumption that the said letter was written on\u00a0 a different date.<br\/><br\/>By the foregoing it has been duly\u00a0 shown that the fourth, fifth,\u00a0 sixth,\u00a0 and seventh\u00a0 errors\u00a0 attributed to the judgment\u00a0 are devoid of\u00a0 reason and\u00a0 legal foundation. With respect to the third error alleged we hold that the admission of the documents designated by the letters L and M\u00a0 was proper\u00a0 for the\u00a0 purpose for which they were\u00a0 presented, because that\u00a0 of\u00a0 letter L is\u00a0 an original and one of the triplicates drawn up for a single purpose, as stated therein, and that of letter M\u00a0 is also an original ratified before a notary, in the certificate of which, dated July 13, 1906, there\u00a0 certainly appears an annotation of the same number 453963 of the cedula of the defendant Villafuerte which he exhibited\u00a0 to the notaries who authenticated the powers of attorney, Exhibits C and D.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the first two alleged errors, relative to Jose Moreno Lacalle being permitted to address questions to some of the witnesses during the hearing of the case, notwithstanding the\u00a0 presence\u00a0 of Attorney Agustin\u00a0 Alvarez, who represented the plaintiff, it is unquestionable that the intervention of the said law clerk\u00a0 and employee of Messrs. Haussermann, Cohn\u00a0 &amp;\u00a0 Williams,\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff's attorneys in this suit, was improperly admitted; it was not authorized by any law, for the reason that the said\u00a0 Lacalle did not have the capacity and\u00a0 qualifications of a lawyer admitted under oath to practice\u00a0 his profession before the courts of these Islands, and therefore, on\u00a0 objection being made to his presence at the hearing of the case, the .judge should have sustained such objection\u00a0 and\u00a0 should\u00a0 have excluded Lacalle and not permitted him to address questions to the plaintiff's witnesses, notwithstanding the fact that Attorney Agustin\u00a0 Alvarez, designated in\u00a0 substitution\u00a0 of the said Haussermann, Cohn &amp; Williams as the plaintiff's representative in the Court of First Instance of Tayabas, was present. Notwithstanding this, the acts performed in the course of some of the proceedings\u00a0 under the\u00a0 direction\u00a0 of Jose Moreno Lacalle are not subject to annulment, as no\u00a0 positive detriment was caused to the defendant, although such intervention is in no\u00a0 manner permitted\u00a0 by the law\u00a0 of procedure.<br\/><br\/>However, even\u00a0 though\u00a0 the questions addressed by Lacalle\u00a0 to the plaintiff's\u00a0 witnesses\u00a0 and the presentation\u00a0 of documents\u00a0 of various kinds exhibited at the trial be stricken out for the reason that\u00a0 they\u00a0 were made\u00a0 by a person who was neither a\u00a0 party to the suit nor counsel for the plaintiff, yet we do\u00a0 not find any\u00a0 reason, based upon any\u00a0 positive prohibition of the law, to authorize the striking out of the answers given by\u00a0 the\u00a0 witnesses\u00a0 interrogated by\u00a0 Lacalle, even though the said answers may have been evoked by questions addressed by a person not authorized by law, and there is much less reason for rejecting the cross-questions addressed to the same witnesses by the defendant's attorney, and the answers thereto.<br\/><br\/>Although the presentation of the documents which support\u00a0 the claims\u00a0 of the plaintiff party be\u00a0 deemed\u00a0 to\u00a0 be improper, on account of their having been made by a person who nad not the qualifications of a practicing attorney it is nevertheless true\u00a0 that their presentation was authorized by the\u00a0 attorney Alvarez and the documents\u00a0 exhibited continued to be united to\u00a0 the record and were not stricken out therefrom on motion by the other side, but, on the\u00a0 contrary, the attorney for the defendant or his counsel discussed the authenticity and validity of the\u00a0 said documents, made allegations\u00a0 against the same and\u00a0 concluded by\u00a0 asking that these documents,\u00a0 and\u00a0 also the inscription of\u00a0 those designated under letters A\u00a0 and B, be declared null and void.<br\/><br\/>From the preceding statements it\u00a0 is concluded that the intervention of Jose Moreno Lacalle in the present suit has in no manner\u00a0 prejudiced the rights and\u00a0 interests\u00a0 of the defendant and that, if judgment was rendered against him and in\u00a0 favor of the plaintiff, it\u00a0 was in consequence of the merits of the evidence adduced by\u00a0 the plaintiff and of the inefficacy and worthlessness of the testimony given by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>If the defendant Marcelino\u00a0 Villafuerte\u00a0 had presented substantial,\u00a0 strong and convincing evidence\u00a0 of the\u00a0 falsity of the two\u00a0 powers of attorney executed in favor of Vicente Marcelo Concepcion,\u00a0 the plaintiff's documentary evidence would have been\u00a0 totally\u00a0 invalidated\u00a0 and annulled, and this suit would have had a different ending.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, it is\u00a0 proper, in our opinion, to affirm the judgment appealed from, as we hereby\u00a0 do, with the costs against the appellant, and in\u00a0 consequence thereof\u00a0 we\u00a0 acquit the plaintiff\u00a0 from\u00a0 the cross complaint relative to the declaration of nullity of the mortgages and inscriptions, as requested by the defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 first day of the term of\u00a0 court\u00a0 immediately following the\u00a0 date on which the fulfilment of this judgment is ordered shall be set for the payment of the amounts due and the foreclosure of the said mortgages.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

D.\u00a0 TEMPLETON.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The learned trial court found the facts to be as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"It\u00a0 conclusively appears\u00a0 that the\u00a0 plaintiff and the defendant, Cenon Rasay, entered into a contract on the 13th day of July, 1907, at Davao, in the Moro\u00a0 Province, P. I,, whereby the defendant Rasay agreed to lease to the plaintiff a\u00a0 two-story building located in the municipality of Davao, the lower story of said building being of cement block and the upper structure being of frame; that the lease of the building was to begin on the 1st day of January, 1908, and to run for five years, and the plaintiff was to pay one hundred\u00a0 and fifty\u00a0 pesos\u00a0 per month\u00a0 on the last day of\u00a0 each month, and\u00a0 as another part of the agreement the plaintiff agreed to advance the defendant Rasay the sum of\u00a0 four thousand pesos in order to enable him to complete the building, and the four thousand pesos\u00a0 were to draw interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum from date of its receipt, and that this advance should be paid by applying one hundred and fifty pesos due for rent\u00a0 per month upon the amount, and at the same time and in connection\u00a0 with the same contract the defendant\u00a0 Rasay made two certain promissory notes,\u00a0 one for five hundred\u00a0 pesos and one for thirty-five hundred pesos, the first five hundred pesos to be paid on or before the 30th day of April, 1908, by monthly installments of one hundred and fifty pesos each, and this note bore interest at eight per cent from date, and the note for thirty-five hundred pesos was to be paid in monthly installments of one hundred and fifty pesos each, following consecutively\u00a0 after the previously mentioned note of five hundred pesos had been paid, and this note bore interest at eight per cent from date.<\/p><p>\"The plaintiff advanced the money either in\u00a0 cash\u00a0 or in merchandise,\u00a0 and no\u00a0 part of same has\u00a0 ever\u00a0 been paid except the sum of\u00a0 three hundred and sixty-two pesos which an agent of plaintiff succeeded in\u00a0 getting hold of from\u00a0 the defendant Rasay.<\/p><p>\"After the contract had been made and the building was in process of finishing, the defendant Rasay\u00a0 had execution levied against him, and the building in question\u00a0 was levied upon\u00a0 and was sold and the defendant Marfori\u00a0 purchased it at\u00a0 a judicial sale.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant Marfori\u00a0 resided\u00a0 in Manila and had representing him at Davao, with full power of attorney as he\u00a0 himself declares, one Bienvenido\u00a0 Blanco, who made a contract with the plaintiff\u00a0 in relation to the building,\u00a0 which\u00a0 provided that\u00a0 he\u00a0 was\u00a0 fully\u00a0 informed regarding the terms of the certain contract between the defendant Rasay and the plaintiff as regards the lease of the building, and\u00a0 that by virtue of his power of attorney for the defendant Marfori,\u00a0 he for and in behalf of said\u00a0 Marfori agreed\u00a0 that should the building come into\u00a0 possession of Marfori, or he\u00a0 have control of same,\u00a0 that said Marfori would comply with all the provisions of the contract above mentioned, and that should any sum of money be advanced by the plaintiff to\u00a0 said Rasay, such sum would be used for the purpose of completing the building, and if not\u00a0 used it was to be returned to the plaintiff.<\/p><p>\"Among other\u00a0 provisions of\u00a0 the contract\u00a0 between the plaintiff and the defendant Rasay, it was\u00a0 agreed that the four thousand pesos advanced, as long as it remained unpaid, should constitute a lien against\u00a0 any\u00a0 property\u00a0 which the defendant Rasay then had.<\/p><p>\"The plaintiff was ready to take\u00a0 over the house as agreed in the contract on the 1st day of January, 1908, but the house was not completed so that it could be occupied by the plaintiff.<\/p><p>\"As herein before found, the contract provided that the lower structure of the house should be built of cement block and the upper structure of frame.\u00a0 The house\u00a0 was of\u00a0 two stories, and it must be concluded that that which said lower structure meant was the lower story, and the upper structure the upper or second story. Witnesses for the plaintiff stated that the lower story was to be built\u00a0 of cement blocks, and that no part of the house was built with cement blocks, but that about three or four feet from the ground had been built of some kind of stone, and then above that thin boards constituted the wall\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 rest of the lower\u00a0 structure or story of the house, which could not be used by the plaintiff for the purpose to which they designed to put the building.<\/p><p>\"Some of the witnesses testified that the building\u00a0 was nearly completed on the 1st\u00a0 day\u00a0 of\u00a0 January,\u00a0 but one of the witnesses for the defendants\u00a0 testified that he worked upon\u00a0 the building all the time until it was finished,\u00a0 and that it was not finished\u00a0 until the last days of March, 1908, and then in the condition in\u00a0 which it now is, and that there were no cement blocks used in the construction of the building in any part of it, as required by the contract.<\/p><p>\"There was clearly a breach of contract on\u00a0 the part of the defendant Rasay in\u00a0 two\u00a0 respects:\u00a0 one is that the building was not completed so\u00a0 that it\u00a0 could be turned over for rental to the plaintiff at the\u00a0 time stipulated in the contract, and the other was that the building was not constructed as the contract required.\"<\/p><p>Judgment was granted by the trial court in the following language;<\/p><p>\"Let judgment be entered in\u00a0 favor\u00a0 of\u00a0 the plaintiff, Macleod &amp; Co.,\u00a0 and against the\u00a0 defendant Cenon Rasay, for the sum of P3,638,\u00a0 with interest thereon at eight per cent per annum since the 13th day of July, 1907, and for the costs of this action, and against the defendant Simeon Marfori and\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 Cenon Rasay, that the house described in the complaint is subject to lien for the amount of this judgment, less the costs, and that the same may be sold to satisfy the judgment.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>We\u00a0 are\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 opinion\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 must\u00a0 be affirmed.\u00a0 The evidence\u00a0 produced\u00a0 upon the trial\u00a0 clearly shows that, as the learned trial court well said, the defendant Rasay failed to perform his contract in two particulars: First. He did not construct the lower\u00a0 story of the building in the manner and with the materials required by the terms of the contract.\u00a0\u00a0 Second. He did not complete the building within the time prescribed by the\u00a0 terms\u00a0 of the\u00a0 contract. The evidence also shows that there was not even a substantial fulfillment of\u00a0 the provisions of the contract.\u00a0 While the failure to perform was\u00a0 not absolutely complete, it\u00a0 was so substantially complete that the plaintiff was\u00a0 fully justified in rescinding the contract and recovering the amount he had paid.<\/p><p>Mr.\u00a0 Kingcome, presented by\u00a0 the attorney for the defendants as their witness, testified\u00a0 that he was the representative of Macleod &amp; Co. at Davao for about two\u00a0 and one-half\u00a0 months\u00a0 in the\u00a0 years 1907-08; that he reached Davao\u00a0 about the\u00a0 28th or 29th of December and left there about the 17th of March, 1908;\u00a0 that\u00a0 he was the agent of the plaintiff and the manager of its branch; that the Davao branch was engaged in the business of buying products of the country\u00a0 generally, such as\u00a0 hemp,\u00a0 and in selling tin goods and groceries; that when he went to Davao the building mentioned in\u00a0 the contract was being built, but the floor was not quite finished and the lower story was according to the contract and specifications\u00a0 not yet begun.\u00a0 He said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The specifications that I refer to are those that appear in the contract dated Davao,\u00a0 July 13, 1907. *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 I did not take much interest in the\u00a0 building.\u00a0 I refused to accept the building and\u00a0 therefore\u00a0 did not take\u00a0 much interest in it.\u00a0 I refused the building, if I remember, on the 29th of December.\u00a0 The reason\u00a0 why I refused it on that date was it was not ready on the 29th and\u00a0 there was no possibility of\u00a0 its being ready and I refused to receive it. It was not ready and I would not take it.\u00a0 I notified Cenon Rasay that I\u00a0 would not take it.\u00a0 I\u00a0 advised\u00a0 him as agent for Simeon Marfori\u00a0 that I should\u00a0 not receive the house unless it\u00a0 was finished\u00a0 according\u00a0 to the\u00a0 specifications\u00a0 by the 31st of December, 1907.\u00a0\u00a0 That advice was verbal and also in\u00a0 writing.\u00a0 I do not know anything about\u00a0 Macleod &amp; Co. having agreed to furnish part of\u00a0 the material for that building.\u00a0\u00a0 Macleod &amp; Co. agreed to furnish them with P4,000.\u00a0 All I\u00a0 know\u00a0 is\u00a0 that\u00a0 according\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 contract Macleod &amp; Co. agreed to furnish them with P4,000.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * There was no possibility of the building being finished by the 31st of December;\u00a0 The contract called\u00a0 for the basement to be made of cement blocks.\u00a0 It was very important to us and\u00a0 all he had done he had put in stone\u00a0 to a height of about three feet and the rest was wood.\u00a0 There was no stone floor in\u00a0 the basement\u00a0 at that\u00a0 time\u00a0 but the wall was about three feet high of stone.\u00a0 There\u00a0 was no stone floor\u00a0 in the basement at\u00a0 all.\u00a0 Prior to my departure for Davao I had not received any instructions\u00a0 from\u00a0 Macleod &amp; Co. to receive the building.\u00a0 That subject\u00a0 was not even mentioned to me.\u00a0 When I took over the management when I was looking\u00a0 into things\u00a0 I saw this contract and\u00a0 the condition of the house, and I saw it was not\u00a0 worth our while to go on playing with the house.\u00a0 They had had six months practically to build the house in and had not done it\u00a0 only, really, two months' work.\u00a0\u00a0 There was no other building in Davao that we might have occupied at that time.\u00a0\u00a0 Macleod &amp; Co. continued in\u00a0 business\u00a0 at Davao\u00a0 2 1\/2 months after we refused to receive the house.\u00a0 I left Davao about the 17th\u00a0 of March.\u00a0 The business\u00a0 was closed\u00a0 at that time. Some little\u00a0 things I\u00a0 left in charge of another firm down there to clear up for me.\u00a0 I received my instructions as to the closing up of the business at the end of January.\u00a0 I then immediately proceeded to close the business.\u00a0\u00a0 It took about 2 1\/2 months to get it closed up.\u00a0 On the 17th of March the lower story of the house was\u00a0 still practically unstarted according to the contract.\u00a0 It called for cement blocks and as I said they had\u00a0 only got this wood.\u00a0 I' do\u00a0 not\u00a0 know when the building was eventually completed but there were no cement blocks in\u00a0 the\u00a0 building on the 17th of March on the lower floor.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 I believe the floor, the cement floor, was finished on the 17th of March.\u00a0 They started to work on it about January.\u00a0 They bought the cement from us to make that floor.\u00a0 I knew what they were buying this cement for.\u00a0 When I notified Rasay that I would not accept the building he replied that the building no longer belonged to him but\u00a0 belonged to\u00a0 Simeon\u00a0 Marfori and that Simeon Marfori\u00a0 would not give him any money.\u00a0 That was about the 29th\u00a0 of December.\u00a0 If I remember rightly it must have been about the middle of January that he bought the cement. He paid\u00a0 me cash for it.\u00a0 That cement was to\u00a0 put in the floor in the basement of the building.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The cement blocks\u00a0 were to go clear to the ceiling of the second story, the whole basement.\u00a0 When\u00a0 I left there the cement floor was\u00a0 in but the blocks\u00a0 were not\u00a0 in the walls in\u00a0 the lower part.\u00a0\u00a0 The house was not painted and the balcony was not finished.\u00a0\u00a0 The house was\u00a0 not only to be used as a warehouse but also\u00a0 as\u00a0 living quarters\u00a0 and\u00a0 office.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 When I left\u00a0 in December for\u00a0 Davao I had no instructions\u00a0 from Macleod\u00a0 &amp; Co. to remove the branch from Davao.\u00a0\u00a0 The matter of removing the branch from Davao was not even discussed before leaving.\u00a0 On the contrary, we\u00a0 were discussing the question of extending the business.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>On cross-examination this witness testified:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The reason why\u00a0 we\u00a0 required walls of that character, cement walls, was in the first place for fire insurance and in the\u00a0 second place for the better preservation of the merchandise inside the warehouse.\u00a0\u00a0 Most of this merchandise consisted of hemp. The condition of these walls after what they called completion was that they were about three feet of stone\u00a0 and the rest\u00a0 of wood and open work,\u00a0 great big chinks in between the\u00a0 slats.\u00a0 The wall was not completed in such condition that\u00a0 it\u00a0 would keep out the elements.\u00a0 It was not\u00a0 even\u00a0 weather-proof.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 On the 29th\u00a0 of December I called Rasay into the office and spoke to him about the building.\u00a0 I just called his\u00a0 attention to the condition of the building and told him if it was not in the condition required I would\u00a0 call\u00a0 the contract off.\u00a0 He said\u00a0 in reply it had left his hands altogether and the house belonged to\u00a0 Simeon Marfori.\u00a0 He said that it was not\u00a0 completed because Simeon Marfori\u00a0 would give him no money to complete it.\u00a0\u00a0 At that time he made no complaint that the house was not completed by reason of the fault of Macleod\u00a0 &amp; Co.\u00a0 He never said a word about it.\u00a0 I did not see Marfori. When I was down there\u00a0 he was in Manila.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Juan\u00a0 Mariano,\u00a0 also a witness for the defendants, testified that he was one of seven or eight workmen engaged\u00a0 in building the house in question\u00a0 and\u00a0 that\u00a0 they\u00a0 begun on the woodwork of the same\u00a0 on the 8th\u00a0 day of December, 1907; that that was the first\u00a0 work done\u00a0 on\u00a0 the house; that on that date they\u00a0 began to smooth and prepare the materials for the\u00a0 building; that they began\u00a0 to place the timbers on the 14th of December; that he worked on the building with the other workmen until the latter part of March,\u00a0 1908, before the same\u00a0 was completed; that prior to the 8th of December he worked for\u00a0 the defendant Rasay on the American Hospital, another building which the defendant Rasay was erecting in that locality; that in the month of December the building lacked a roof and uprights (harigues); that at the end of December\u00a0 there were some stones\u00a0 placed in the lower part of the lower story\u00a0 of the house,\u00a0 but after placing\u00a0 the stones it was necessary to build the wall and place the\u00a0 other materials; that he\u00a0 remembered\u00a0 distinctly that the house was not finished until the month of March. The testimony\u00a0 of this\u00a0 witness was\u00a0 of such a character that the defense deemed it necessary, in\u00a0 order to\u00a0 overcome its\u00a0 evil\u00a0 effects upon its\u00a0 case, to\u00a0 replace upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 stand the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 Rasay.\u00a0 In his testimony upon his\u00a0 second examination he stated\u00a0 that all of the work on the\u00a0 house was completed in\u00a0 the month of March,\u00a0 1908.<\/p><p>On cross-examination these questions were asked him:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q. What day\u00a0 of\u00a0 the month\u00a0 of\u00a0 March\u00a0 was the house completed? - A. I am not able to tell you the precise date, about the middle of March, almost the end of March.<\/p><p>\"Q.<em> From the 1st day of January until the end of March you had employed there for the purpose of completing the house 7 or 8 men continuously? - A,\u00a0 Yes, sir.\"<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote><p>This\u00a0 is the testimony presented by the witnesses for the defendant himself.<\/p><p>George D. Templeton, a witness for the plaintiff, testified that, during the time\u00a0 when the house in question was being erected, he was an employee of the firm of Macleod &amp; Co. in\u00a0 Davao; that the defendant Rasay occupied the house himself in\u00a0 the months of December and\u00a0 January, although it was not completed; that he thereafter rented it to Capt. W. J. Platka\u00a0 and Lieut. E. L. Dunsworth and Antonio de Goicouria,\u00a0 all of the\u00a0 Constabulary.\u00a0 He testified also that the house was not completed until March, 1908.<\/p><p>This\u00a0 witness\u00a0 also testified that while the plaintiff furnished to the defendant certain\u00a0 materials, such materials were so furnished in the same way and\u00a0 for the same purpose as to\u00a0 other customers; that\u00a0 the agreement in\u00a0 controversy was to furnish <em>money<\/em> and not<em> materials<\/em>.\u00a0 The witness denied that the\u00a0 reason why the plaintiff refused to accept the house was because Macleod &amp; Co. desired to close their business in Davao.<\/p><p>Simeon Marfori himself testified that Rasay occupied the house and that it was afterwards\u00a0 rented\u00a0 by him to various Americans.<\/p><p>William J. Platka,\u00a0 a witness for the\u00a0 plaintiff, testified that in\u00a0 the\u00a0 year 1908 he occupied the\u00a0 house in\u00a0 question, having rented it from Cenon Rasay, one of the defendants; that the lower story of the house is about 12 feet high; that he moved into the house about July,\u00a0 1908, and lived there until March, 1909; that at that time the sides of the kitchen were not yet put up, nor were they on the\u00a0 lower story which was used as a storeroom.\u00a0 As to the lower story, there was no cement on the floor and the heat of the sun warped the sides so that in\u00a0 a severe rainstorm the water would come in and he found it necessary to give it up as a storeroom. He also testified that the wood in the lower\u00a0 story was of some soft nature, from which the pitch would run.<\/p><p>Herman\u00a0 Forst testified in behalf of the plantiff that he was assistant manager of the plaintiff company in Manila. He stated in connection with the building of the house as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The\u00a0 understanding was that\u00a0 it was to be according to the contract, and there was also a verbal agreement that the lower part was to be built of cement and the upper part of wood; and I believe there was some arrangement\u00a0 about the height of the lower part which was to be built of cement; and I remember particularly having taken the matter up because we were going to use the upper part of the building as a dwelling house, and the lower part as a go-down for hemp, and we could not get insurance unless the building was constructed\u00a0 that way, and we would not think of carrying hemp in a building without insurance.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>On cross-examination these questions and answers appear:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q. You say it was indispensable that the lower part of that building should be constructed of cement? - A. No, sir; not indispensable for those who would accept a house of that kind, but we considered it indispensable that the building should be constructed of stone\u00a0 or brick.<\/p><p>\"Q. You mean indispensable for the purposes of insurance? - A. Yes, sir;\u00a0 certainly.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>This witness also testified that whatever materials were furnished to the defendant by the plaintiff in the construction of the\u00a0 house were furnished\u00a0 promptly on his orders and\u00a0 were delivered promptly and without delay. Concerning the withdrawal of the branch of the plaintiff company from Davao this witness testified:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q. Can\u00a0 you state whether Macleod\u00a0 &amp; Co. had\u00a0 either discussed or had any intention of withdrawing from business at\u00a0 Davao? - A.\u00a0 That was in\u00a0 December; at the time Mr. Kingcome left for Davao there was no intention to withdraw.\u00a0 The first indication that\u00a0 we had\u00a0 that\u00a0 we should withdraw from the Davao business\u00a0 came from one of our principals in Chicago sometime in January, 1908; that was the first intimation we had of the intention to close all provincial agencies.<\/p><p>\"Q. Now,\u00a0 if\u00a0 that\u00a0 building\u00a0 had\u00a0 been\u00a0 turned\u00a0 over to Macleod &amp; Co. on the\u00a0 1st of January, 1908,\u00a0 can you state whether or not it would have been accepted by the firm? -\u00a0 A. Of course it would, by all means, as that would have been living up to the contract.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>On cross-examination this witness testified\u00a0 that they had an agent in Davao and that they had received complaints from Mr. Kingcome and\u00a0 Mr. Stevenson that the building was not being constructed in accordance with the contract.<\/p><p>We have\u00a0 given\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony of\u00a0 the\u00a0 witnesses for the parties thus at length believing that\u00a0 it\u00a0 is perhaps\u00a0 the quickest\u00a0 and most satisfactory way of disposing\u00a0 of the errors assigned by the defendants on this\u00a0 appeal.<\/p><p>That it has met our\u00a0 expectations in this regard\u00a0 will appear when we state the assignments of error.\u00a0 They are as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The trial court erred in rendering judgment against the defendants and dismissing the cross complaint, because:<\/p><p>\"1. Plaintiff elected to sue for damages only, thus under art. 1556 of the Spanish Civil Code, leaving the contract of lease subsisting;<\/p><p>\"2. Plaintiff admitted upon the trial that it was not claiming damages, as none such could be proven;<\/p><p>\"3. Plaintiff\" did not perform substantially its own part of the building contract in question;<\/p><p>\"4. Plaintiff admitted upon the trial that notwithstanding that it knew of the alleged noncompliance by defendants with the\u00a0 building specifications it continued to furnish defendants\u00a0 materials for the building, with the intention of later remedying the alleged defects itself, so as to comply with insurance requirements;<\/p><p>\"5. Plaintiff knew when it furnished the last lot of building materials that it was physically impossible for defendants to complete the building by January\u00a0 1st, 1908;<\/p><p>\"6. The building contract in question did not require that the building be wholly and completely finished by January 1, 1908:<\/p><p>\"7. The alleged\u00a0 nonperformance by defendants\u00a0 of\u00a0 the building contract in no way prejudiced plaintiff, as plaintiff expressly admitted upon the trial.<\/p><p>\"8. There was a substantial performance of the building contract upon the part of the defendants;<\/p><p>\"9. The delay of one year and seven\u00a0 months in bringing this action is an unreasonable one under the circumstances, and lastly;<\/p><p>\"10. The\u00a0 evidence shows that\u00a0 the true reason for plaintiff's refusal to accept the building was the closing up of all its Mindanao branches.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>As is readily seen, the evidence above quoted, as a matter of fact, disposes adversely to the appellants of the errors assigned as\u00a0 Nos. 3, 4, 5,\u00a0 6, 7, 8, and 10.<\/p><p>Apart from the answers which the facts themselves give most of these assignments of error need little attention.<\/p><p>As to the\u00a0 error assigned as number 2, it may be said that while the plaintiff, in\u00a0 one sense, has proved no damages, it certainly\u00a0 cannot be said that it\u00a0 was\u00a0 not injured\u00a0 by\u00a0 the failure of the defendant Rasay\u00a0 to furnish it the building which he had agreed to\u00a0 furnish.\u00a0 When one has paid full value for one kind of a house and is offered another which will in no sense meet the purpose\u00a0 prescribed by the contract of purchase, it\u00a0 seems idle to assert that he has received no injury.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff\u00a0 in this case loaned P4,000\u00a0 to\u00a0 the defendant to erect a building for a given purpose and to be built in a certain manner\u00a0 and at a\u00a0 certain time. The building\u00a0 was not completed at the time\u00a0 specified, it was not built of the materials nor in\u00a0 the manner required, nor was it at all suitable to the purposes for which the plaintiff desired it.<\/p><p>As to the\u00a0 third error assigned, namely, that the plaintiff did not substantially perform its own part of the building contract in question, it requires\u00a0 as little notice as the previous one.\u00a0 The plaintiff made\u00a0 no\u00a0 <em>building <\/em>contract.\u00a0 Its agreement was\u00a0 to furnish to the defendant <em>four thousand pesos<\/em>,\u00a0 While it did not deliver to the defendant fully that sum,\u00a0 it delivered every\u00a0 peso that he asked\u00a0 for.\u00a0 There is no allegation, and if there\u00a0 were, substantially no proof to support it, that the defendant was\u00a0 unable to complete the building by reason of the failure of the plaintiff to perform bis part of the agreement in question.\u00a0\u00a0 It is the undisputed evidence that the plaintiff never made any contract to furnish the defendant materials in\u00a0 any sense which legally relates it to the contract of building.\u00a0 There is evidence that the plaintiff sold and delivered to defendant certain materials which the defendant used in the erection of the building. On the other hand, the great and unquestioned preponderance of the evidence is\u00a0 that the plaintiff delivered to\u00a0 the defendant such\u00a0 materials promptly and\u00a0 without delay.<\/p><p>As to error number 4,\u00a0 it need be said simply that we have no recollection that the plaintiff made the admission alleged. The assertion on the part of one of the witnesses for the plaintiff was substantially\u00a0 to the effect that the plaintiff stood\u00a0 ready to accept the building, even though it contained many minor defects, provided it was\u00a0 completed so nearly in accordance with the contract as to make it usable for the purposes intended.\u00a0\u00a0 It nowhere appears, so far as we have been able\u00a0 to find, that it was ever the intention, express or implied, of the\u00a0 plaintiff to accept\u00a0 the\u00a0 building with the serious and substantially irremediable defects which it had even after it had been completed, so called, in March, 1908.<\/p><p>We are unable to see\u00a0 any material relation which error No. 5 has with the merits of this case.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no reason whatever\u00a0 why plaintiff should refuse to sell the defendant merchandise merely because he\u00a0 had failed\u00a0 to complete a building destined for the plaintiff within the time specified in the contract. Plaintiff sold him materials in the same way that\u00a0 he would sell to\u00a0 any other customer. The mere fact that defendant was at\u00a0 the time engaged in erecting a building for the plaintiff does not, in the absence of other facts and circumstances, necessarily indicate any waiver on the part of the plaintiff as\u00a0 to the time when the building should be completed.<\/p><p>Error No. 6 may be answered by quoting that paragraph of the contract which says:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The term of this\u00a0 lease will\u00a0 run\u00a0 for\u00a0 the period of five (5)\u00a0 years\u00a0 from the\u00a0 1st day of January, 1908,\u00a0 by\u00a0 which time the said party of the\u00a0 first part agrees to have said building in such\u00a0 shape\u00a0 as may be required by the party of the\u00a0 second part, provided that any instrument (instructions)\u00a0 which said party of the second\u00a0 part may give in regard to the arrangement\u00a0 of the building\u00a0 shall be given in writing.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Error assigned\u00a0 as\u00a0 No. 7\u00a0 may be answered in the same way as No. 2 was answered.<\/p><p>In asserting as error No.\u00a0 8 that \"there was a substantial performance of the\u00a0 building contract\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the part of the defendants\" the appellants go counter not\u00a0 only to the preponderance of\u00a0 but to the overwhelming\u00a0 weight of the evidence in the case.<\/p><p>We answer error assigned as No.\u00a0 10\u00a0 which alleges that \"the evidence shows\u00a0 that the\u00a0 true\u00a0 reason\u00a0 for plaintiff's refusal to\u00a0 accept\u00a0 the building was\u00a0 the\u00a0 closing up\u00a0 of\u00a0 all its Mindanao branches\" by\u00a0 pointing\u00a0 to the evidence above transcribed in which it clearly appears that the determination of the\u00a0 plaintiff to withdraw its provincial branches was not made until the latter part of the month of January, 1908, when a sudden and peremptory order to that effect was\u00a0 received from one of its principal officers in Chicago. Therefore,\u00a0 at the time of the rejection\u00a0 of the building by the plaintiff, there was\u00a0 no intention\u00a0 whatever upon\u00a0 its part, so far as the proofs go, to withdraw and abandon its provincial agencies.\u00a0 The uncontradicted proofs are to the effect that there was rather an intention to extend them.<\/p><p>Adverting to error\u00a0 number 9,\u00a0 we are unable to say from the whole\u00a0 record of this case that the\u00a0 delay\u00a0 of one year and seven months on the part of plaintiff in bringing this action was unreasonable. It nowhere appears in the record that\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants have\u00a0 been peculiarly prejudiced by reason of such delay.<\/p><p>As to the\u00a0 error assigned as number 1, which deals with the nature of the action brought as determined\u00a0 by the complaint filed, it appears to\u00a0 us that the objection is rather technical than substantial.\u00a0 While apparently the complaint is one founded upon a\u00a0 breach of contract and prays for damages caused by reason of such breach, nevertheless, it alleges facts sufficient to sustain an action\u00a0 for\u00a0 a rescission of the contract and the recovery of the sum paid thereunder. Throughout the trial the parties seem to have regarded the action as one for rescission of contract and recovery of the money paid\u00a0 thereunder\u00a0 and evidence was\u00a0 offered by both parties and\u00a0 received by the\u00a0 court apparently upon\u00a0 that theory.\u00a0 No\u00a0 one was deceived by\u00a0 the technical form and prayer of the complaint.\u00a0 All of the material facts to sustain either action appear upon the face of the complaint and the defendant was fully notified of the delinquencies of which he was charged and of the grounds upon which the plaintiff sought to recover the money it had paid out.\u00a0 The question was fairly fought out upon the merits , the\u00a0 facts fully gone into; every phase of the question investigated and discussed; and we can see no reason why at this time an objection to the form of the complaint should be permitted to prevail.<\/p><p>For these reasons the judgment appealed from is affirmed, without special finding as to costs.<\/p><p><em>Mapa, Johnson<\/em>,\u00a0 and <em>Trent, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Vicente Jocson presiding, convicting the accused\u00a0 of the crime of\u00a0 homicide and sentencing him to twelve years and one day of <em> reclusion temporal<\/em>, to the accessories provided by law, to indemnification in the sum of P1,000, and to pay the costs of the trial.<p>The\u00a0 real\u00a0 question presented for our\u00a0 consideration\u00a0 is whether or not the accused acted in self\u00a0 defense in causing the death of the deceased.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 learned trial court in his opinion says:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"It is a fact admitted by both parties that Leon Polio died on\u00a0 the 5th day of April of the present year\u00a0 in consequence of a wound which he\u00a0 had received, caused by a sharp instrument, which\u00a0 penetrated to the ribs, extending obliquely downward from left\u00a0 to\u00a0 right across the right portion of the chest, 9 centimeters long 3 centimeters wide and 3\u00a0 centimeters deep, which wound was the result, according\u00a0 to the proofs, of a fight which occurred between Juan Federizo and the deceased Leon Polio.\u00a0 The real causes of this fight have not been clearly\u00a0 demonstrated, although it is indicated by the proofs of the defense that it was by reason of slanderous expressions spoken of the deceased by Juan Federizo.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Proceeding to a discussion of the evidence the court says:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The proofs of the prosecution demonstrate conclusively that the author of Leon Polio's wound was\u00a0 the accused, Juan Federizo, although the accused denies this.\u00a0 The accused sought to establish that Leon Polio, who carried a bolo, asked\u00a0 satisfaction of the accused\u00a0 and\u00a0 by reason of a slight dispute which\u00a0 arose between\u00a0 them, Leon\u00a0 Polio struck\u00a0 at him six or seven times with his bolo, the accused restricting himself entirely to retreating\u00a0 and frustrating the blows delivered against him without having on his part struck a blow with the bolo which he also carried.\u00a0 A careful examination of the\u00a0 proofs, although apparently the accused, with more or less cleverness, sought to establish a defense of self-defense, claiming that the deceased was the aggressor, leads us\u00a0 to\u00a0 believe,\u00a0 nevertheless,\u00a0 in the first place, that the fight took place\u00a0 in front of a tienda at a distance from the house of Juan Federizo of about SO meters and not 8\u00a0 meters as the witnesses of the defense testified, and that the testimony of a witness near to the combatants, named Dionisio Emiliano, is true when he testified that on passing by Leon Polio and Juan Federizo they\u00a0 stood facing each other each one\u00a0 with a\u00a0 bolo in his hand,\u00a0 and that after having got past them at a\u00a0 distance of about three meters he heard the sound\u00a0 of a flow, and\u00a0 turning his head\u00a0 immediately, he saw that Leon Polio was wounded in the right breast,\u00a0 and thereupon ran\u00a0 to\u00a0 tell the authorities of what had occurred; that while two other witnesses appeared upon the scene shortly after the blow\u00a0 had been given,\u00a0 none of them saw\u00a0 Leon Polio strike or offer to strike Juan\u00a0 Federizo,\u00a0 as\u00a0 the\u00a0 witnesses\u00a0 of the defense\u00a0 allege.\u00a0\u00a0 I am convinced that these declarations of the accused and of his witnesses are not true, for if the fight had really been such as they described, undoubtedly the witnesses who arrived on the scene, especially Dionisio Emiliano, would have seen the delivery of such blows, and if it is true, as the witnesses of the defense assert,\u00a0 that the\u00a0 accused confined\u00a0 himself simply to\u00a0 defending himself and warding\u00a0 off\u00a0 the\u00a0 blows of his assailant and\u00a0 himself struck no\u00a0 blow,\u00a0 it is incomprehensible that Leon Polio would have been wounded.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The deceased lived eight days after receiving his injury. The wound was located on the right breast and\u00a0 was 9\u00a0 centimeters (about-3 inches) long,\u00a0 3 centimeters (about 1\u00a0 inch) wide, and 3 centimeters deep,\u00a0 extending across the nipple downward\u00a0 diagonally from\u00a0 left to right.\u00a0 The wound was not necessarily fatal, it having penetrated no deeper than the ribs.\u00a0\u00a0 It was curable with prompt and proper attention. The physician who attended the deceased testified that death was caused by pneumonia following the heavy loss of blood which the deceased sustained before being able to obtain the assistance of a physician.<\/p><p>We find ourselves unable to agree with the learned trial court\u00a0 in his appreciation of the weight and\u00a0 effect of the evidence presented in the case.\u00a0\u00a0 influence which were either\u00a0 overlooked\u00a0 or\u00a0 not given their proper effect.<\/p><p>In the first place the trial court did not take into consideration that it is the undisputed evidence in the case that on the day before the fight occurred the\u00a0 accused, having then a debt due him from\u00a0 the deceased of long standing, sent word to the deceased by Tiburcio Devanadera that he must pay the debt at once, adding that\u00a0 it was generally understood\u00a0 in that community\u00a0 that\u00a0 any person\u00a0 who did not pay a just debt was a swindler; that this\u00a0 message was delivered to the deceased on the afternoon or evening of the day\u00a0 preceding the\u00a0 fight; that by reason\u00a0 of such message the deceased became angry and the\u00a0 following morning presented himself at\u00a0 the\u00a0 house of the accused, bolo in hand, and demanded satisfaction for the slander which he claimed the accused had\u00a0 uttered against him; that at that moment the accused was engaged in\u00a0 cutting banana leaves from the trees surrounding a well on\u00a0 his premises, and that on being called\u00a0 by\u00a0 the deceased he\u00a0 responded, carrying with\u00a0 him the bolo which he was using in\u00a0 his work.<\/p><p>This is very important where self-defense is alleged as it shows\u00a0 that the deceased was the mover,\u00a0 the initiator of the affair in which he lost\u00a0 his life.<\/p><p>The court failed to take into consideration, in the second place, that it is\u00a0 the undisputed\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 of the case\u00a0 that the deceased was a man \"<em>fornido y valiente<\/em>\"\u00a0 and that he was irascible and\u00a0 of violent character;\u00a0 that so much\u00a0 was the deceased feared that the witness\u00a0 Jacinto Joval,\u00a0 who saw the fight from the window of his house, did not dare descend and intervene\u00a0 or even give\u00a0 an alarm,\u00a0 fearing that he would be attacked in turn by the deceased; that at the time of calling out the accused the deceased exhibited anger to such an extent that it was noticed by the witness Melecio Aquino who, by reason thereof, ceased the\u00a0 work in which he was then engaged to watch what was going to\u00a0 happen.<\/p><p>This is also very important in view of the theory of self-defense.<\/p><p>In the third place, we are of the opinion that the\u00a0 trial court erred in giving\u00a0 controlling importance to the testimony of the\u00a0 witness Dionisio Emiliano.\u00a0 This witness admittedly saw\u00a0 nothing of what occurred between the\u00a0 two, the accused and the deceased.\u00a0 His testimony is that he was taking a walk that\u00a0 morning and\u00a0 passed near\u00a0 where\u00a0 the accused and the\u00a0 decedent were\u00a0 standing talking\u00a0 to\u00a0 each other; that after he had got past them about 18 feet\u00a0 (not 3 meters as stated by the court) he heard a sound, which he calls the sound of a blow, and, on turning his head, saw that the deceased was wounded in the right breast.\u00a0 He claims to have seen no hostile move on the part of either,\u00a0 nor did he hear any loud words\u00a0 pass between them.\u00a0 This is clearly a very incomplete story of what must, from every standpoint of probability and reason,\u00a0 have\u00a0 actually occurred.\u00a0 Granting that this witness, in what he\u00a0 said, told\u00a0 the truth,\u00a0 it is evident that the\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 may have attacked the\u00a0 accused and several blows may have passed between\u00a0 them while the witness Emiliano was walking the 18 feet referred to.\u00a0 This interval, in which the witness' back was turned, is filled by the witnesses of the\u00a0 defense, two of whom testified\u00a0 directly and positively that they saw the fight from beginning to end.\u00a0 These witnesses are disinterested, so far as can be ascertained, are unrelated to the parties, and appear to have no reason for testifying falsely.\u00a0\u00a0 They assert that the deceased came to the house of the accused with a bolo in hig hand, with every appearance of being angry, and called him out into the street; that he spoke to the accused in an excited manner for a\u00a0 minute and then attacked him with his bolo; striking at him several times; that the accused retreated, using his bolo\u00a0 in defending himself,\u00a0 These witnesses assert that they did not see the accused strike any blow, although it is possible that he may have struck several in such a manner that, by reason of the\u00a0 changing positions of the combatants, they were unable to see them.\u00a0 It seems to us that in view of this direct and positive testimony of these witnesses, supported as it is by the testimony of the accused himself, the declaration of Dionisio Emiliano, who admittedly knew nothing of what\u00a0 had occurred until it was all over, should not be given controlling weight in this case. It is true that the deceased received his wound during the fight and undoubtedly received it at the hands\u00a0 of the accused.\u00a0 That does not necessarily mean, however, that he is guilty of the crime charged.<\/p><p>It is worthy of note that the first person who appeared on the scene, Aniceto Devanadera, one of the witnesses for the prosecution,\u00a0 desiring to stop the fight, seized, not the accused, but the\u00a0 deceased.\u00a0 This might fairly be held to indicate that it was the deceased who was the aggressor rather than the accused, as it\u00a0 is usual in stopping a fight to seize\u00a0 and hold the aggressor and not\u00a0 the one retreating. This circumstance corroborates the testimony of the witnesses for the accused when they assert that the deceased was the aggressor in the affray.<\/p><p>The prosecution does not contend under the proofs that \u00a0 the accused set upon and killed the deceased out of hand. \u00a0 It concedes at the very least that there was a fight in which \u00a0 blows were exchanged.\u00a0 This is\u00a0 apparent\u00a0 in every line of \u00a0 the decision of the trial\u00a0 court as above set forth. Yet no \u00a0 importance\u00a0 is given to that fact, although it is\u00a0 more corroborative of that testimony\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 defense which shows \u00a0 that the deceased was the aggressor and attacked the\u00a0 accused with his bolo, the latter retreating until Polio ceased \u00a0 by reason of his wound, than it is of the testimony of\u00a0 the witness Emiliano which shows no fight at all.\u00a0 If the decedent received his wound while he was attacking the accused \u00a0 with a deadly weapon, and while the latter was\u00a0 defending\u00a0 himself from said attack,\u00a0 the judgment of conviction can \u00a0 not stand. That\u00a0 such was the case appears\u00a0 so strongly from the evidence that there remains a doubt in our minds \u00a0 of the guilt of the accused. While, as we have before stated, \u00a0 the wound upon the breast of the\u00a0 deceased was caused by \u00a0 a blow from\u00a0 the bolo in the\u00a0 hands of the accused, nevertheless, along with the testimony introduced to prove that \u00a0 fact there goes an abundance of other testimony showing \u00a0 that the blow was given in self-defense.\u00a0 That the deceased \u00a0 attacked the\u00a0 accused without provocation is substantially undisputed; at least it is undisputed by any direct evidence, \u00a0 and the circumstantial evidence presented in the case to the contrary is so slight as not to warrant founding a judgment \u00a0 of conviction on it.\u00a0 We are of the\u00a0 opinion that the accused must be acquitted of the crime charged and it is so ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

After trial and proof that the defendant was suffering from mental aberration, the judge on April 28 rendered the judgment cited above, whereupon the\u00a0 defendant's\u00a0 counsel appealed\u00a0 to this\u00a0 court.<\/p><p>By another writing of June 27,\u00a0 the same counsel asked for immediate\u00a0 suspension\u00a0 of execution of the judgment, because it\u00a0 had been appealed and had not become final. He also requested annulment of\u00a0 the sale at public auction of the property attached by the sheriff or his deputy under order of the court, for making indemnification with\u00a0 the defendant's property in accordance with said judgment, as the attachment had been executed upon the property of the non-Christian woman named Dioalan and of other persons, and not upon that of the defendant.<\/p><p>In opposition thereto, the\u00a0 provincial fiscal on the 30th of the same month requested in writing that the appeal from this judgment filed by the counsel for the defense be\u00a0 not admitted or\u00a0 carried forward, representing that it was\u00a0 out of order as having been submitted beyond the time limit; for on the very day said judgment was rendered, April 28, 1910, the accused's counsel,\u00a0 Sotero\u00a0 Serrano, was\u00a0 verbally notified thereof, and it is therefore untrue that he was notified\u00a0 only on\u00a0 June 17\u00a0 of\u00a0 said\u00a0 year, on which date he read and\u00a0 examined\u00a0 the case\u00a0 and without the clerk's knowledge signed the same, making it appear that he was notified on that date, June 17, when he had known since April 28 of the judgment,\u00a0 of\u00a0 which the judge had verbally informed him, although the latter did not then have him sign it.<\/p><p>In reply to this motion of the provincial fiscal, the defense requested that the appeal filed be\u00a0 admitted and carried forward, representing that, when the court verbally announced his decision to defendant's counsel; the judgment had not yet been entered, and therefore neither the defendant nor his counsel could be notified thereof in legal form until said date, June 17.<\/p><p>Passing upon this motion on August 2, 1910, the court declared said appeal out of order and dismissed it;\u00a0 and, furthermore, denied the petition for suspension of judgment, as said\u00a0 judgment had become final.<\/p><p>Thereupon,\u00a0 counsel for the defendant\u00a0 resorted\u00a0 to this court with a petition praying that a writ be issued directing said judge, Chanco, to admit the appeal and forward it, at the same time\u00a0 annulling\u00a0 all\u00a0 action taken\u00a0 for execution\u00a0 of the judgments rendered in the causes for murder and for <em>lesiones.<\/em>\u00a0\u00a0 After consideration thereof, the Attorney-General, on behalf of said judge and of the provincial fiscal, requested that this remedy be declared out of order, as the issuance of such a writ against the judge of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur, and much more against the provincial fiscal, was not in\u00a0 accordance with law; but this court by order of November 15 saw fit to declare said remedy of\u00a0 mandamus to be in order and issued a\u00a0 written order directing the judge of the Court of First Instance to immediately\u00a0 admit the appeal filed\u00a0 in\u00a0 these two causes\u00a0 and to forward all the records to this higher court.\u00a0 At the same time he was instructed to refrain absolutely from executing said judgments or causing them\u00a0 to be\u00a0 executed while said appeals were\u00a0 pending, a prohibition\u00a0 that was\u00a0 extended to the provincial sheriff, his agents\u00a0 and representatives, until further order from this\u00a0 court.\u00a0 Upon notification\u00a0 of\u00a0 the foregoing and in compliance therewith, the judge by order of November 22 admitted the appeal filed by counsel for the defense both in the cause for murder and in that for <em>lesiones.<\/em><\/p><p>The question raised on the appeal filed in this case by counsel\u00a0 for the\u00a0 insane\u00a0 defendant, Baggay, jr.,\u00a0 is solely whether he, notwithstanding that he was held exempt from criminal liability, has\u00a0 nevertheless incurred\u00a0 civil liability, with\u00a0 obligation to indemnify the\u00a0 heirs of the\u00a0 murdered woman\u00a0 and to pay the costs.<\/p><p>Article\u00a0 17 of the Penal Code states:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Every person criminally liable for\u00a0 a crime or misdemeanor is also civilly liable.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Article\u00a0 18 of the same code\u00a0 says;\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The\u00a0 exemption from criminal\u00a0 liability declared in Nos. 1, 2, 3,\u00a0 7, and 10 of article 8 does not include exemption from civil liability, which shall be enforced, subject to the following:<\/p><\/blockquote><p>\"(1)\u00a0 In cases 1, 2,\u00a0 and 3, the persons who are\u00a0 civilly liable for acts committed by a lunatic or imbecile, or a person under 9 years of age, or over this age and under 15, who has not acted with the exercise of judgment, are those who have them under\u00a0 their\u00a0 authority,\u00a0 legal guardianship or power, unless they prove that there was\u00a0 no blame or negligence on their part.\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Should there be no person having\u00a0 them under\u00a0 his authority, legal guardianship, or power, or if such person be insolvent, the said lunatics, imbeciles,\u00a0 or minors shall answer with their own\u00a0 property, excepting that part which is exempted for their support in\u00a0 accordance with the civil law.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>True it is that civil liability accompanies criminal \"liability,\u00a0 because every person liable criminally for a crime or misdemeanor is\u00a0 also liable for reparation of\u00a0 damage\u00a0 and for\u00a0 indemnification\u00a0 of the harm\u00a0 done, but there may be civil liability because of acts ordinarily punishable, although the law has declared their perpetrators exempt from criminal liability. Such is the case of a lunatic or insane person who, in spite of his irresponsibility on account of the deplorable condition of his deranged mind, is still reasonably and justly liable with his property for\u00a0 the consequences of his acts, even though they be performed unwittingly, for the\u00a0 reason\u00a0 that\u00a0 his fellows ought not to suffer from the disastrous results of his harmful\u00a0 acts more than is\u00a0 necessary, in spite of his unfortunate condition.\u00a0 Law and society are\u00a0 under obligation to protect him during his illness and so when he is declared to be liable with his\u00a0 property for reparation and\u00a0 indemnification, he is\u00a0 still entitled to the benefit of\u00a0 what is necessary for his decent maintenance, but this protection does not exclude liability for damage caused to those who may have the misfortune\u00a0 to suffer the consequences of his acts.<\/p><p>According to the law, the persons in the first place liable. are those\u00a0 who have the insane party under their care or guardianship, unless they prove that there was no blame or negligence on their part; but if the demented person or imbecile lack a guardian or some\u00a0 person charged\u00a0 with his care, or if the\u00a0 latter be insolvent, then his own property must meet the civil\u00a0 liability of indemnifying or repairing the damage\u00a0 done, and for this reason judges and courts in rendering judgment in a criminal cause prosecuted against an insane or demented\u00a0 person,\u00a0 even when\u00a0 they hold\u00a0 the accused exempt from criminal liability,\u00a0 must\u00a0 fix the civil liability of\u00a0 the persons\u00a0 charged\u00a0 with watching over and caring for him or the liability of the demented person himself with his property for reparation of the damage and indemnification for the harm done, unless the offended party or the heirs of the\u00a0 person\u00a0 murdered expressly\u00a0 renounce such reparation or indemnification.<\/p><p>Therefore, the judgment appealed from being in accordance with law, affirmation thereof is proper, and it is hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<\/p><p><em> Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/em>, and <em>Moretand, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

that he being a property holder in that vicinity knew the lands of the two Pasises; that the lands of these two persons had been abandoned\u00a0 for some years; and that\u00a0 he knew of only one dam, aside\u00a0 from the plaintiff's, that one being the one placed there in April by the two Pasises.<\/p><p>Francisco Agcaoili, 47 years of age and a native and resident of Vintar,\u00a0 the third\u00a0 witness called by the\u00a0 plaintiff, corroborated the testimony of the other two witnesses in all its material parts and further stated\u00a0 that\u00a0 some distance above the plaintiff's dam there are the\u00a0 old ruins of another dam,\u00a0 but\u00a0 that these\u00a0 old\u00a0 ruins do\u00a0 not\u00a0 disturb the natural course of the water.<\/p><p>The next witness, Aniceto Agcaoili, who is\u00a0 a brother-in-law and tenant of the plaintiff, corroborated the other witnesses.<\/p><p>The plaintiff presented in rebuttal the deputy sheriff who destroyed by order of the court the dam which Duque and Diza started to build in\u00a0 1904.\u00a0 This witness testified that when he and his companions destroyed\u00a0 this partially built dam, there\u00a0 existed no other near that place.<\/p><p>The plaintiff was\u00a0 present\u00a0 and after\u00a0 testifying that he purchased this land in 1883, stated that since that time up to 1904, he\u00a0 had the exclusive use of the water in this <em>zanja<\/em>; that the defendants never had since this purchase, attempted in any way to disturb the free flow of water therein until April, 1910; and that the documents which he received from his vendors showed that\u00a0 said vendors were the owners of this <em>zanja<\/em> and had been\u00a0 using\" the same for a great many years.<\/p><p>The defendants presented Mateo Leano, 49 years of age; Ignacio Acasio; Victorino Agpaca, 46 years of age; Benito Maltezo, 46 years of age; Casimiro Diza, 49 years of age; and Dionisio Pasis, 31 years of age; all natives and residents of the town of Vintar, who testified that they have known the lands of the two principal defendants ever since their childhood; that these lands have been all this time under cultivation; that the two\u00a0 defendants (Pasises) owned\u00a0 lands on each side of the <em>zanja<\/em>; and that the said Pasises have been using\u00a0 all the water which flows in this\u00a0 <em>zanja<\/em>, except that which in time of heavy rains flows over or filters through their dam, for the purpose of irrigating these rice lands. The majority of these\u00a0 witnesses testified further that the ancestors of these two defendants likewise\u00a0 used this water in the same manner and for the same purpose.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendants presented also Eutiquio Diza, who stated that he was present at the time the deputy sheriff destroyed the partially constructed\u00a0 dam in 1904; that after the water had been released he saw another partially constructed dam just about three meters above this one, and that the deputy sheriff could not have seen this partially constructed dam for the reason that he did not remain on the premises until the dam which he was ordered to remove was completely destroyed or removed, and that when he (the deputy sheriff) left, the water held by this dam covered the other one.<\/p><p>Before proceeding with the analysis of this testimony to determine its probative force, it is well to note that the trial court based his decision, to a great extent, upon the decision of the court in the case decided in 1904, wherein this plaintiff was the complaining party and Dionisio Duque and Casimiro Diza were the defendants.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither Cornelio Pasis nor Dionisio\u00a0 Pasis was a party to that suit,\u00a0 nor did they have anything whatever to do with that case.\u00a0 They did not acquire their\u00a0 rights to their lands or to the\u00a0 use of this water from the defendants in that case.\u00a0\u00a0 That they are not bound by the decision in that case is a rule of\u00a0 law too well settled to require the citation of authorities\u00a0 to\u00a0 support\u00a0 it.\u00a0 The court should not have taken into consideration, in making his findings of fact in this case, the decision in that suit.<\/p><p>The testimony is very conflicting, the witnesses for the plaintiff testifying in support of the allegations in the complaint, while the witnesses for the defendants testified just as positively in support of the contention of the defendants. We realize, and take into\u00a0 consideration, the fact that the trial court had an opportunity to see these witnesses, observe their\u00a0 demeanor on\u00a0 the stand, and hear them testify; but there does not appear in the decision appealed from any reason given by the court why it accepted as true the testimony of the plaintiff's witnesses, while\u00a0 on the other hand we can see a\u00a0 number of well-founded reasons why\u00a0 the testimony of the defendants'\u00a0 witnesses should have controlled.\u00a0 One of these\u00a0 principal reasons is the fact that the\u00a0 lands of the two defendants, Cornelio and Dionisio Pasis, which lie on\u00a0 each side of this <em>zanja,<\/em> are rice lands now under cultivation and have been for a great number of years, and that these two defendants have nowhere to obtain water for the irrigation of these lands except from this<em> zanja<\/em>; while, on the other hand, the plaintiff's lands lie below those of the defendants,\u00a0 and he has another source from which\u00a0 he can obtain water\u00a0 for irrigating his lands, this source being another<em> zanja<\/em> which empties into the <em>zanja<\/em> in question below the lands of the defendants.\u00a0 It might be true that this second <em>zanja<\/em> does not furnish sufficient water during an extremely dry season to irrigate the plaintiff's lands.\u00a0 However this may be, the significant fact remains, as we have said, that he can and does obtain\u00a0 water from this second\u00a0 zanja, and the defendants could not have\u00a0 cultivated their lands if they had not used the water from the <em>zanja<\/em> in question.\u00a0 We think the trial court\u00a0 failed\u00a0 to\u00a0 give these important circumstances\u00a0 due consideration.<\/p><p>For these reasons the judgment appealed from is reversed and the complaint dismissed without costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em> Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, <\/em>and <em>Moreland, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

but that the judgment of the court below must be reversed\u00a0 in so far as it allows to the plaintiff the sum of P11,900, the difference between the contract price and the estimated cost of constructing two other launches, the construction of which at the cost of the defendant was authorized by the above-mentioned judgment of the Supreme Court but not actually executed in accordance with the terms of that judgment; and further, we\u00a0 are\u00a0 of opinion that the judgment of the court below must be reversed in so far as it denies the right of the plaintiff to recover in this action the sum of P4,895, with interest from the 6th day of March, 1907, the date\u00a0 of the filing of the complaint, that being the amount advanced by\u00a0 the plaintiff\u00a0 over and above the contract\u00a0 price of the single. launch\u00a0 actually constructed in conformity with the original\u00a0 contract, and which would have been credited\u00a0 to the plaintiff in the settlement of his indebtedness had all the launches been constructed under the contract.<br\/><br\/>In support of our conclusions it is sufficient, we think,\u00a0 to indicate:\u00a0 First,\u00a0 That the defendant can not\u00a0 be heard\u00a0 at this time to deny the binding effect upon, him of the final judgment rendered against him in 1900, which he has never sought to have set aside, and for the performance of which he was bound by his own action in appearing to \"sustain the right of the\u00a0 defendant as the legitimate son and\u00a0 heir of the latter.\"\u00a0 Second, That the evidence satisfactorily establishes that the launch actually constructed under the terms of the judgment was in fact constructed for the plaintiff \"at the expense of the defendant\" at a cost which exceeded the original contract price by the sum of Pl,824.16, Third, That\u00a0 the judgment of the Supreme\u00a0 Court dated November 18, 1900, on which plaintiff relies in this action, secured to him the right to have specific performance of the original contract, or to have the contract\u00a0 executed\u00a0 at the expense of the defendant and recoup any loss which he might incur resulting from the necessary expenditure therein of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a greater amount than the contract price.\u00a0\u00a0 But this judgment made no express provision for the recovery by him of damages unless the contract\u00a0 was actually\u00a0 executed\u00a0 at\u00a0 the expense of the defendant; and the plaintiff' having elected to sue for specific performance and secured judgment therefor can not be permitted arbitrarily to abandon the contract for the specific enforcement of which judgment was granted, and convert\u00a0 the judgment for specific performance\u00a0 into a judgment for damages the <i>only<\/i> measure of which is\u00a0 the difference between the contract price and the estimated, not the actual cost of executing the contract at the time when he elects to have\u00a0 that estimate made.\u00a0 We may add that the evidence of record satisfies us that plaintiff did, in fact, abandon the\u00a0 unexecuted\u00a0 portion of the contract long prior to the institution of this action.\u00a0 Fourth, That the complaint in this action clearly arid specifically prays for they recovery of the above-mentioned sum of P4,895 which was advanced by the plaintiff on\u00a0 account of the unexecuted portion of the contract, and the\u00a0 evidence satisfactorily\u00a0 establishing the justice of the claim and the amount of the advance as alleged we know of no reason why he should not have had judgment therefor in this action, without being\u00a0 put to the expense and delay involved in the institution of a separate action therefor as seems to have been required by the court below.\u00a0\u00a0 The justice of this particular claim not having been substantially denied at the\u00a0 trial in the court below, and disallowing\u00a0 as we do the\u00a0 greater part of the judgment\u00a0 in favor of the plaintiff\u00a0 in the court below, we are1 of opinion that the modified judgment to be entered by thin court should dispose as far as may be of\u00a0 this as well as of all the other issues involved in these proceedings, and thus, perhaps, bring an end to litigation which so long has vexed the courts and the interested parties.<br\/><br\/>Twenty days hereafter let judgment be\u00a0 entered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P6,719.16, with legal interest thereon from the 6th day\u00a0 of March, 1907, affirming so much of the judgment below as\u00a0 is in conformity herewith, and reversing so much\u00a0 thereof as is not, without costs to either party in either instance.\u00a0 Ten days thereafter let the record be returned to\u00a0 the court below\u00a0 for execution of the above judgment, and for\u00a0 such\u00a0 further\u00a0 proceedings as\u00a0 may\u00a0 be necessary and proper to. make it effective.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

From that decision the defendants appealed to this court and made several assignments of error.<br\/><br\/>The undisputed facts, as presented by the record brought to this court, seem to be as follows:<br\/><br\/>That on the 23d day of April, 1897, Juan Banatin died, leaving a\u00a0 widow (Damasa Alcala), the plaintiff herein, and seventeen nieces and nephews, whose names\u00a0 are set out in the petition; that on\u00a0 the 13th day of\u00a0 June, 1897, the said widow and all of the seventeen nieces\u00a0 and nephews, except Tranquilina Banatin, entered into a voluntary agreement among themselves for the division \"entre ellos,\" of all of the property left by the said Juan Banatin, deceased, except the house described in paragraph 4 of\u00a0 the petition; that by the terms of said agreement, the said house was to remain undivided; that the widow\u00a0 (the plaintiff herein)\u00a0 should receive the one-half of the usufruct of said house during her lifetime; that the other one-half of the usufruct\u00a0 should be distributed equally\u00a0 among the other seventeen heirs; that Francisco Salgado,\u00a0 one of the nephews,\u00a0 should administer the said house, collecting the rents of the same and deliver one-half to the widow (Damasa\u00a0 Alcala) and the other one-half to the nieces and nephews; that Francisco Salgado, having failed to pay to Damasa Alcala her share\u00a0 of the usufruct of said property, was sued by her and a judgment was finally rendered against him for the same.\u00a0 (Alcala <i>vs.<\/i> Salgado, 7 Phil. Rep., 151.)\u00a0 An execution was issued upon said judgment and one-half of the undivided property in question was sold some time\u00a0 in\u00a0 the year 1907, to\u00a0 one Macario Decena.\u00a0 On\u00a0 the. 22d and\u00a0 24th days\u00a0 of\u00a0 October, 1908\u00a0 (see Exhibits 2 and 3),\u00a0 the said one-half of the property in question was repurchased by the heirs of Francisco\u00a0 Salgado.\u00a0 The money used in\u00a0 repurchasing\u00a0 the property by\u00a0 the heirs of Francisco\u00a0 Salgado\u00a0 was the money of four of\u00a0 the heirs of Juan Banatin, to wit: Modesta\u00a0 Pabalan, Procopio Pabalan, Basilio Salgado, and Juan Banay- banay (see Exhibit 4\u00a0 of defendants herein), and\u00a0 not\u00a0 the money of the heirs of Francisco Salgado.\u00a0 On the 25th day of November, 1908, thirteen of the nieces and nephews or heirs of Juan\u00a0 Banatin,\u00a0 by means\u00a0 of a\u00a0 public document, recognized the right of the said Modesta Pabalan, Procopio Pabalan, Basilio Salgado, and\u00a0 Juan Banay-banay as\u00a0 the owners of the one-half of the undivided property in question. (See Exhibit 5.)\u00a0\u00a0 On the 25th day of November, 1908, six. teen of.the\u00a0 heirs of the said\u00a0 Juan Banatin, by. a public document, unanimously appointed the said Modesta Pabalan as\u00a0 \"administradora\" of\u00a0 all of\u00a0 the\u00a0 house in question,\u00a0 in substitution of the said Francisco Salgado deceased.\u00a0 (See Exhibit 6.)\u00a0 Since the 25th day of November, 1908,\u00a0 until the commencement of the present action, Modesta\u00a0 Pabalan had administered the\u00a0 property in\u00a0 question, collected the rents of the\u00a0 same and had paid the one-half of said rents to the plaintiff herein as the usufructuary of the one-half of said property,<br\/><br\/>The first assignment of error made by the plaintiff is that \"El juzgado erro al estimar que la testamentaria del finado Juan Banatin no ha finalizada.\"<br\/><br\/>With reference to this assignment of error, the heirs of Juan Banatin were at\u00a0 perfect\u00a0 liberty to divide the estate among themselves, assuming the responsibility of any debts which might exist. There is no proof that any debts existed.\u00a0\u00a0 After the actual division of the estate among themselves they became the absolute owners of their respective allotments and were tenants in common of that portion of the property which remained pro indiviso.\u00a0 After the mutual agreement among themselves for the division of the estate, either actually distributing their respective shares or leaving the same undivided, the property in question was no longer the property of the estate\u00a0 of\u00a0 Juan Banatin, but the undivided property\u00a0 of the heirs.\u00a0 They were tenants in common\u00a0 of that portion of\u00a0 the\u00a0 property\u00a0 which remained undivided.\u00a0 As such\u00a0 tenants in common the majority of them had a\u00a0 right to agree upon the appointment\u00a0 of an administrator of\u00a0 their property,\u00a0 (Art. 398,\u00a0 Civil Code.) The\u00a0 property belonged to them.\u00a0 They had a right to administer it.<br\/><br\/>The lower court in appointing the plaintiff and\u00a0 appellee as administratrix of the property in question, evidently did so upon the theory that the\u00a0 said property\u00a0 was\u00a0 still the property of the estate of Juan Banatin.\u00a0 In this theory the lower court\u00a0 was mistaken.\u00a0 There was nothing left of the estate of Juan Banatin to be administered.\u00a0 The heirs by mutual\u00a0 agreement had divided the property\u00a0 among themselves.\u00a0 There was\u00a0 no occasion and\u00a0 no\u00a0 reason\u00a0 for the appointment of an administrator by the probate court, and, therefore, the judgment of the\u00a0 lower court appointing Damasa Alcala as administratrix of the estate of Juan Banatin for the purpose of administering the property mentioned in paragraph 4 of the petition, is hereby revoked.<br\/><br\/>We deem it unnecessary in the present case to discuss the right of a usufructuary to manage or assist in managing or to administer the property in\u00a0 usufruct which belongs to tenants in common.\u00a0 That question is not presented in the present cause.<br\/><br\/>Without any finding as to costs, it is\u00a0 hereby directed that a judgment be entered reversing the judgment of the lower court appointing\u00a0 Damasa Alcala as\u00a0 administratrix of the property in question.\u00a0 It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres<\/i> and <i>Mapa, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><i> Carson<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur in\u00a0 the dispositive part.<br\/><\/div>",

Appellant alleges that the notary admitted\u00a0 in his\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 that he was not\u00a0 sure whether the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 was the same Victoriano\u00a0 Pore. That he was <em>not very sure<\/em>, is what the notary replied, but said that it must be he.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 certificate of recognition which, under existing law, a notary affixes to an\u00a0 instrument, is not the same as was required by\u00a0 Spanish notarial\u00a0 legislation for legalizing a document.\u00a0\u00a0 Under\u00a0 the latter\u00a0 he had to\u00a0 have\u00a0 personal knowledge beforehand, or\u00a0 prior\u00a0 to the execution, and in the absence thereof, that of two witnesses, which fact was recorded in the instrument, while\u00a0 under existing law he certifies to the knowledge he acquires at the time: \"that it is the person who executed the foregoing instrument.\"<\/p><p>And if in his four\u00a0 cedulas, from 1906 to 1910, Victoriano\u00a0 Pore appears to have signed\u00a0 with a\u00a0 mark, it may be so, just as it happened that in the. 1906 cedula he appears to be 32 years old\u00a0 and in the 1907 cedula he is then 41 years old; and it\u00a0 might have\u00a0 happened that\u00a0 in these two cedulas he stated that he\u00a0 was a merchant and in the later ones a <em>laborer<\/em>; and so he might have replied to the question, whether he had had any\u00a0 business with the plaintiffs, by saying:\u00a0 \"No, sir, I am only a laborer.\"<\/p><p>The conclusion\u00a0 reached from the evidence\u00a0 by the\u00a0 trial court is therefore correct and\u00a0 free from error.<\/p><p>The judgment is affirmed,\u00a0 with\u00a0 the costs of\u00a0 this instance against the appellant.<\/p><p><em>Torres,\u00a0 Mapa, Johnson,\u00a0 Carson, Moreland<\/em>, and\u00a0 <em>Trent, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Veloso;\u00a0 that\u00a0 the plaintiffs, as\u00a0 the only heirs of Maria Andrada,\u00a0 are\u00a0 entitled\u00a0 to the possession\u00a0 of\u00a0 the property in question,\u00a0 and that the defendants are wrongfully withholding from\u00a0 them the possession\u00a0 of the same.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs prayed\u00a0 for the\u00a0 possession of the land in question, together with damages in the\u00a0 sum of P1,000 for the wrongful withholding\u00a0 of the same,\u00a0 and\u00a0 costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendants answered the petition of the plaintiffs and alleged that Maria Andrada, on the 9th of November, 1904, by means of a public document, <i>\"de donacion absoluta e\u00a0 irrevocable\"<\/i> gave to\u00a0 the defendant,\u00a0 Felix\u00a0 Sevilla,\u00a0 the parcels of land referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the complaint;\u00a0 that\u00a0 at\u00a0 the\u00a0 time of the said\u00a0 donation Maria Andrada was the absolute owner of the said property and that the same was free from any incumbrance whatsoever; that the said donation was ratified by Maria Andrada in three other public documents, bearing: date of the\u00a0 16th of November,\u00a0 1904, the 10th of January, 1905, and the 10th of April,\u00a0 1905, respectively, and that the plaintiifs knew of the said\u00a0 donation as early as\u00a0 the 16th of August, 1905.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the\u00a0 trial of the cause, the lower court found\u00a0 that\u00a0 the said donation was executed in\u00a0 violation\u00a0 of the provisions of article 634 of the Civil Code and was, therefore, null\u00a0 and void.\u00a0 Said article 634 provides\u00a0 that:<br\/><blockquote>\"A donation may\u00a0 comprise all of the actual property of the donor or a part of it, provided he reserves in fee simple or in usufruct what is required\u00a0 for his. support in a\u00a0 condition\u00a0 corresponding to\u00a0 his circumstances.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The evident theory of the lower\u00a0 court was that a donation otall of the actual property\u00a0 of a donor or a part of it without a\u00a0 reservation in\u00a0 fee simple\u00a0 or in usufruct\u00a0 was void ab initio.\u00a0\u00a0 This interpretation of said section is not justified.\u00a0 A donation of all of the\u00a0 actual\u00a0 property of the donor or a part of it without reservation in fee simple or\u00a0 in usufruct\u00a0 is not\u00a0 void,\u00a0 but voidable\u00a0 only.\u00a0 Any other interpretation of said article would\u00a0 place a limitation upon the right of owners of property to dispose of the same.\u00a0 The article, however, does give to the donor a right to have the donation declared null and void\u00a0 if\u00a0 made in contravention of its provisions.\u00a0 (5 Manresa,\u00a0 pp. 121-130.)\u00a0\u00a0 The donation\u00a0 was made on the\u00a0 9th of November,\u00a0 1904, and was ratified three times after that, dates as above stated.<br\/><br\/>Maria Andrada died on the 23d of January, 1908.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no proof in the record that she ever took any steps to have said donation annulled, or that she\u00a0 ever\u00a0 complained to any person or persons whatever concerning the provisions of said\u00a0 donation.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing1 would seem to be sufficient discussion of the questions presented to dispose of them, but an examination of\u00a0 document marked No. 3, dated November 9, 1904, the same being one of the documents ratifying\u00a0 the\u00a0 said donation, discloses\u00a0 that Maria\u00a0 Andrada, in paragraph 1 of said\u00a0 document,\u00a0 did\u00a0 make the following reservation:<br\/><blockquote>\"1.\u00a0 That there is not included in the property I gave to Felix\u00a0 Sevilla y Macam\u00a0 on November 9, 1904, the monthly installment of fifty pesos\u00a0 which I then reserved to myself for suitable living\u00a0 expenses and other needs, which sum, while I\u00a0 live, shall be derived from either\u00a0 the rental or the sale of\u00a0 the property given to Felix Sevilla y Macam; and in fact,\u00a0 to date,\u00a0 I have received\u00a0 monthly not only fifty, but eighty-five pesos, in addition to what I have also asked and received from Felix Sevilla out of\u00a0 what he earns in his office.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>With\u00a0 this reservation in the donation, certainly there has been no violation of the provisions of said article 634.<br\/><br\/>Upon\u00a0 a full consideration of all of the facts\u00a0 adduced during the trial\u00a0 of the\u00a0 cause, we find no foundation for the claim of the plaintiffs.\u00a0 There is no proof that the donee failed at any\u00a0 time\u00a0 to\u00a0 comply with the provisions of\u00a0 said donation, nor is there any proof that Maria Andrada\u00a0 ever attempted to revoke the said donation.<br\/><br\/>For all the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 we hold that the judgment of the lower court should\u00a0 be reversed and that a judgment should be entered absolving the defendants from any liability under the said\u00a0 complaint, and without any\u00a0 finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Carson, <\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Lopez, Mateo Navarro, Teofilo Osorio, and Carlucio Alban entered the store of Dy-Yong, situated within the jurisdiction of the municipality of\u00a0 Dalaguete, Province of Cebu, and, after having entered this store, Lopez told the Chinaman, Dy-Yong, that he, Lopez,\u00a0 was\u00a0 an internal-revenue agent, and at the same time exhibited his badge.\u00a0 Immediately thereafter Lopez, assisted by Navarro, commenced to search the store, and after having examined the contents of certain boxes they pretended\u00a0 that\u00a0 they had found\u00a0 a small quantity\u00a0 of\u00a0 opium concealed in one of the boxes. The Chinaman denied the ownership of this opium,\u00a0 stating that he knew absolutely nothing about its being in that box. The accused and his\u00a0 companions then threatened to arrest this Chinaman and take him to the municipality on a charge of violating the\u00a0 Opium Law.\u00a0 The Chinaman protested his innocence and showed signs of refusing to submit\u00a0 to arrest. At that moment Navarro and Alban\u00a0 drew their\u00a0 revolvers and pointing them at the\u00a0 Chinaman\u00a0 told\u00a0 him to follow them.\u00a0 At this moment Lopez proposed to release the Chinaman and not report this charge against him if he would give them P400.\u00a0 The Chinaman\u00a0 could not\u00a0 pay this amount because he did not\u00a0 have\u00a0 the money, but he\u00a0 did pay Lopez the sum of P60\u00a0 on\u00a0 condition that they would\u00a0 release him. After Lopez had received this sum they refused to\u00a0 release him but forced him to accompany them in the direction of the municipality.\u00a0 When but a short distance from\u00a0 the Chinaman's store, and in\u00a0 front of the house of one Santiago Caren, some one proposed that they enter Santiago's house.

Charles S. Lobingier presiding1,\u00a0 dismissing the complaint in this case upon its merits, the plaintiff appealed.<br\/><br\/>The only question raised by this appeal is purely one of law.<br\/><br\/>Remedios Grey, wife of the plaintiff, died intestate\u00a0 in 1905 without ascendants or descendants, leaving a surviving husband and one sister and three brothers.\u00a0 Under the law, the sisters and brothers are called to inherit all of the estate of the deceased, subject only to the right of the surviving husband, the plaintiff, to a usufructuary interest in one-half thereof.<br\/><br\/>Administration proceedings in the estate of\u00a0 the deceased wife were not\u00a0 taken out until June 15,. 1907, when Jose Grey, one of the defendants, was appointed administrator. In these\u00a0 administration\u00a0 proceedings,\u00a0 the\u00a0 Court of First Instance of this city issued a decree on December 3, 1910, declaring that each one of the defendants in the case at bar was entitled to one-fourth part of the estate of the deceased Remedios Grey, subject to the plaintiff's (Vicente Reyes') right to the usufruct.<br\/><br\/>Prior to the\u00a0 appointment of the administrator for the estate of the deceased Remedios Grey, and\u00a0 as the result of certain judicial\u00a0 proceedings had against her surviving husband (the plaintiff in the case at bar), his usufructuary interest in the estate of his deceased wife\u00a0 was sold under execution\u00a0 and deeds issued therefor to the purchaser, the defendant Jose Grey.\u00a0 Such deeds still\u00a0 subsist\u00a0 in full force and effect, no\u00a0 steps ever having been taken either to annul or set them aside or to redeem the interest of the plaintiff thus sold.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, as surviving husband of the\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 Remedios Grey, now sues the sister and brothers of his deceased wife, claiming of them\u00a0 the\u00a0 payment of\u00a0 his usufructuary interest in the property of the deceased, basing his claim upon two grounds: first, that the execution sale and the sheriff's deeds executed pursuant thereto did not divest him of his usufructuary interest in the property and that the defendants\u00a0 still\u00a0 remain\u00a0 charged with\u00a0 its\u00a0 payment;\u00a0 and second, the defendants having failed to appeal from the order of the probate court dated December\u00a0 3, 1910, which order was issued some three years after an attempt\u00a0 was made to sell under execution the plaintiff's usufructuary interest, and that order having become final, it settled the plaintiff's right to a usufructuary interest, and\u00a0 the defendants can not now deny this fact.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the plaintiff now insists that a usufructuary interest in real property is not such an interest or right as can be sold under execution.\u00a0 With this contention\u00a0 we can not agree.\u00a0\u00a0 Section 450 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Sec. 450. <i>Property liable to execution.<\/i> - All goods, chattels, moneys, and other property, both\u00a0 real and personal, or any interest therein of the judgment debtor,\u00a0 not exempt by Jaw, and all property and rights of property seized and held under attachment in the action, shall be liable to execution. Shares and interests in any corporation or\u00a0 company,\u00a0 and debts, credits, and all other property, both\u00a0 real\u00a0 and personal, or any interest in\u00a0 either real or personal property, and all other property not capable of manual delivery, may be attached on execution, in like manner as\u00a0 upon writs of attachment.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The term \"property\" as here applied to lands comprehends every species of\u00a0 title, inchoate or complete; legal or equitable.\u00a0 This statute authorizes the sale under execution of every kind\u00a0 of property,\u00a0 and\u00a0 every interest in\u00a0 property which is, or may be,\u00a0 the subject of private ownership and transfer.\u00a0 It deals with equitable\u00a0 rights and interests as it deals with legal, without anywhere expressly recognizing or making any distinction\u00a0 between them.<br\/><br\/>Article 480 of the Civil\u00a0 Code reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"The usufructuary\u00a0 may personally enjoy the\u00a0 thing in usufruct, lease it to another person, or alienate his right to the usufruct, even for a good consideration;\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>If the usufructuary right is one which may be leased or sold,\u00a0 it must logically\u00a0 and necessarily\u00a0 follow that such a right is an \"interest\" in real property within the meaning of section 450 of the Code of Civil Procedure, above quoted. It was the plaintiff's usufructuary right in real\u00a0 property which was sold under execution.\u00a0 This right was conferred upon him at the death of his wife by\u00a0 operation of law,\u00a0 and by virtue of such a right he was entitled to receive all the natural,\u00a0 industrial, and civil fruits of said real property in usufruct.\u00a0 He was entitled to hold the actual, material possession of\u00a0 such property during his lifetime, and was obligated\u00a0 only to\u00a0 preserve its\u00a0 form and\u00a0 substance.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 other words, he was\u00a0 entitled, subject to this\u00a0 restriction, to use the property as his own.\u00a0\u00a0 He was the real owner\u00a0 of\u00a0 this interest, and article 480, <i>supra,<\/i> conferred upon him the right to enjoy the possession of the property or lease it to another or to sell such interest\u00a0 outright.\u00a0 We think the real test, as to whether or not property can be attached and sold upon execution is does the judgment debtor hold such\u00a0 a\u00a0 beneficial interest in such\u00a0 property that he can sell or otherwise dispose of\u00a0 it for value?\u00a0 If he does,\u00a0 then\u00a0 the property is subject to\u00a0 execution and payment of his debts.\u00a0 The\u00a0 right of usufruct is\u00a0 such an interest, and when\u00a0 the sheriff sold the plaintiff's usufructuary right by virtue of an execution, he had no further interest in said property.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff's\u00a0 second contention\u00a0 that the\u00a0 defendants, by failing\u00a0 to appeal\u00a0 from\u00a0 the order\u00a0 of the court in\u00a0 the administration\u00a0 proceedings dated December 3, 1910, wherein the right of plaintiff to\u00a0 a usufructuary interest in\u00a0 the property was recognized, have lost their right to refuse such payment to him at this time, is not well founded.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff\u00a0 had no interest\u00a0 in this property at the time\u00a0 the probate court\u00a0 issued\u00a0 this order.\u00a0 The order only\u00a0 set\u00a0 out the fact that under the law the plaintiff was entitled to a usufructuary interest in one-half of the estate\u00a0 of his\u00a0 deceased wife.\u00a0 It was not a finding that in the meantime\u00a0 the plaintiff\u00a0 had not sold, leased,\u00a0 or otherwise disposed\u00a0 of or lost such right of participation.\u00a0\u00a0 This order,\u00a0 merely fixed the legal status of the plaintiff and did not have the effect of\u00a0 canceling or\u00a0 annuling\u00a0 the sale\u00a0 made by the\u00a0 sheriff. Again, the\u00a0 plaintiff instituted the action in the case at bar on June 1,\u00a0 1910,\u00a0 several months\u00a0 prior to the\u00a0 order of December 3,\u00a0 1910.\u00a0 The right\u00a0 to\u00a0 recover was traversed by the defendants on July 1 of that same year, and the question was pending and undetermined at the time the probate court issued its order.<br\/><br\/>The validity of the execution\u00a0 sale\u00a0 was not an issue in those\u00a0 administration proceedings, and\u00a0 the order of\u00a0 December 3d\u00a0 cannot, under\u00a0 any circumstances, be\u00a0 held to affect the validity of such a sale.<br\/><br\/>The judgment\u00a0 appealed from is therefore affirmed,\u00a0 with costs against the\u00a0 appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The Spanish\u00a0 courts and Spanish\u00a0 authors\u00a0 seem\u00a0 to be in hopeless conflict upon the question whether or\u00a0 not\u00a0 persons holding the relation of debtor simply may be guilty of the crime of <i>estafa,<\/i> under paragraph\u00a0 5 of article 535 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 We are of the opinion\u00a0 and so decide that when the relation is purely that of a debtor and creditor, the debtor can not be held liable for the crime of <i>estafa,<\/i> under said article, by merely refusing to pay or by denying\u00a0 the indebtedness.\u00a0 Therefore,\u00a0 without discussing\u00a0 or deciding the\u00a0 other\u00a0 questions presented\u00a0 by the\u00a0 appellant, it is hereby ordered\u00a0 that the sentence of the lower court be reversed and that an order be entered dismissing the complaint and absolving the defendant from all liability under the same, with costs <i>de oficio<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0 It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Torres, Mapa,<\/i> and <i>Moreland,\u00a0 JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><center><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">CONCURRING<\/span><br\/><\/center> <br\/><br\/><b>CARSON, <i>J<\/i>., <\/b><br\/><br\/>I\u00a0 agree with\u00a0 the disposing\u00a0 portion\u00a0 of the\u00a0 foregoing opinion.<br\/><br\/>I do not understand that there is any conflict of authority either in Spain or in the United\u00a0 States as to the non-liability of a\u00a0 debtor to imprisonment for failure to pay his\u00a0 debt, where the relation\u00a0 between\u00a0 himself\u00a0 and\u00a0 his creditor is simply that of debtor and creditor.\u00a0 No Spanish court or author, so far as I am aware, has ever construed the body of Spanish Law now in force in these Islands or which was in force at the time\u00a0 when Spain relinquished its sovereignty to the United States, so as to hold that when the relation is purely that of a debtor and creditor,\u00a0 the debtor may be held liable for the crime of\u00a0 <i>estafa <\/i>or\u00a0 any other crime, by merely failing or\u00a0 refusing to\u00a0 pay the indebtedness.<br\/><br\/>The conflict of\u00a0 Spanish authority appears to be limited to the question whether a debtor may be held guilty of the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>,\u00a0 who knowingly, maliciously and for the purpose of gain\u00a0 (<i>con\u00a0 onimo de lucro<\/i>), falsely denies the existence of his debt.<br\/><br\/>This, of course, is a wholly different matter from a refusal or failure to pay the\u00a0 debt.<br\/><br\/>The Supreme Court of Spain has uniformly\u00a0 held that such a\u00a0 denial constitutes one of the offenses\u00a0 defined and penalized in\u00a0 the\u00a0 chapter of the Penal Code which deals with\u00a0 <i>estafa<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0 Viada, Pacheco and\u00a0 other Spanish authors vigorously contend that the provisions of that chapter of the code defining the crime of<i> estafa<\/i> are not broad enough to include the <i>false denial of the existence of a debt<\/i>.\u00a0 \"Much may be said\u00a0 on both sides of the contention;\" but construing these provisions of the Penal Code with that strictness with which American courts have always held themselves bound to construe penal\u00a0 statutes\u00a0 generally, I think that this\u00a0 court is justified in departing from the doctrine laid down by the supreme court\u00a0 of Spain, and\u00a0 in holding that the false denial by a debtor of the existence of a\u00a0 debt contracted by him, even when such a denial is knowingly false, malicious and\u00a0 made \"<i>con animo de lucro\"<\/i> does not constitute the crime of <i>estafa,<\/i> defined arid penalized in the code.<br\/><br\/>This, as I\u00a0 understand it, is the\u00a0 real question involved in this\u00a0 appeal.<br\/><\/div>",

When this case was called for trial the complaint as to Cabonico was, upon motion\u00a0 of the provincial fiscal, dismissed and the said Cabonico was called as\u00a0 a witness for the prosecution and testified that\u00a0 between 12 and 1 o'clock\u00a0 on that day, the 26th of May, Chino\u00a0 Aua employed him to go out to the steamer <em>Ton Yek<\/em> and receive a sack of caramelo from\u00a0 the appellant; that on arriving alongside the steamer in his banca the appellant lowered this sack into his banca and that on his return the opium was\u00a0 discovered in\u00a0 the manner above set forth. The defendant not only denied having anything whatever to do with this transaction, but stated that he did not know and had never seen Cabonico.\u00a0\u00a0 But Cabonico testified that he had known the defendant for some time and that this was the third time he had been sent out to receive packages from\u00a0 the appellant.\u00a0 Cabonico's testimony\u00a0 is reasonable, direct, and positive.\u00a0 It is not denied by the appellant that the opium was found as stated\u00a0 by Dimakiling.\u00a0 If Cabonico had known that the sack contained opium it is not reasonable to suppose that he would have given Dimakiling an opportunity to cross the river\u00a0 in his banca; he would have known that he would have been running the risk of being caught in open\u00a0 violation\u00a0 of the law.\u00a0 He,\u00a0 believing that the sack contained caramelo only,\u00a0 thought nothing of permitting Dimakiling to enter his banca, so it can not be said that Cabonico was in fact an accomplice.<\/p><p>The judgment being strictly in accordance with law and the merits of the case the same is hereby affirmed with costs against the appellant.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

In August, 1909, the woman swore\u00a0 out a complaint before the justice of the peace\u00a0 of Talisay, charging Locson with seduction\u00a0 under\u00a0 promise of\u00a0 marriage,\u00a0 and with\u00a0 having abandoned her after the birth of her child.\u00a0 Later, some time\u00a0 in the\u00a0 month of November,\u00a0 1909, an\u00a0 information charging the\u00a0 accused with the same offense was filed in the Court of First Instance, and this charge was pending in that court at the time of her death.<\/p><p>On the\u00a0 night of December 3, 1909, the woman and her child\u00a0 were at Bacolod visiting at the house of a relative, having gone\u00a0 there apparently in connection with the proceedings in the Court of First Instance upon her complaint against the appellant Jose\" Locson. About 10 o'clock on that night, gathering up her\u00a0 personal effects and\u00a0 taking with her the child, she left the house in company with the appellant Penetrante, who had called there for her, saying when she left that she was going to return\u00a0 to her home in Talisay. Not far from the house\u00a0 they were\u00a0 joined by Locson\u00a0 and Labasa, who were waiting there with a conveyance, a kind of <em>quiles <\/em>drawn by a\u00a0 carabao.\u00a0 Soon\u00a0 thereafter the conveyance started on the\u00a0 main road toward Talisay,\u00a0 the occupants\u00a0 being Dominga Treyes, deceased,\u00a0 and her child, Locson, Penetrante and Labasa.\u00a0 The distance from Bacolod to Talisay is some 8 kilometers, and on the night in question the road appears to have been in fair condition.\u00a0\u00a0 The weight of the evidence indicates,\u00a0 however, that the party consumed several hours in making the trip.\u00a0 A stop was made at a bridge just before entering Talisay, the duration of which, according to\u00a0 Penetrante, was some thirty minutes.\u00a0 No explanation of the purpose of this stop appears in evidence. Several witnesses\u00a0 testified that they saw\u00a0 the conveyance arriving in Talisay at an early hour, approximately 3 o'clock on the morning of December 4, and recognized among the occupants the appellants Locson\u00a0 and Penetrante, and the woman Dominga Treyes and her child. The public road from Bacolod to Talisay continues directly through the town of Talisay, and is there known as Calle Taft; this street |s crossed at right angles by Calle Filipina.\u00a0 From the evidence it appears that the conveyance stopped at or near the corner of Calle Taft and Calle Filipina, about 50 meters from the house of Macaria Treyes on Calle Filipina.<\/p><p>Julian Agriam testified that he saw the conveyance stop at this corner, and that Jose\" Locson then drew the woman from the\u00a0 <em>quiles,<\/em> and putting his arm\u00a0 around\u00a0 her waist, supported her toward the house of her aunt, Macaria Treyes, followed by\u00a0 Penetrante\u00a0 carrying the\u00a0 child.\u00a0 He\u00a0 further testified that\u00a0 he heard Dominga say: \"O, Jose\", the punishment you have given me will bring me to my grave, but you will afterwards pay for it yourself.\" This\u00a0 witness further testified that after the two men left the woman and the child at the house\u00a0 of Macaria Treyes, they hurried back to the vehicle and drove away, and that soon thereafter he heard the woman Macaria Treyes\u00a0 calling for help, saying that Dominga was dead.<\/p><p>Another witness, Jose\" Agasan, testified that he saw Jose\" Locson and Dominga Treyes come from the rig, walking slowly, Jose having his arm around the back of Dominga, and that with them came a man carrying a child.<\/p><p>Leon Cortes, who\u00a0 lives across\u00a0 the street from Macaria Treyes, testified to practically the same\u00a0 facts.<\/p><p>Macaria\u00a0 Treyes, an aunt of Dominga\u00a0 Treyes\u00a0 on\u00a0 the father's side, testified that about 3 o'clock on the morning of December 4 the door of her house was pushed open, and that Jose\"\u00a0 Locson left\u00a0 her niece,\u00a0 Dominga Treyes,\u00a0 at the door, where the child was placed by\u00a0 another man.\u00a0 That Dominga supported herself against the door for\u00a0 a short interval, and then fell to the floor, crying \"Aunt Caye, Jos6 killed me,\" and there and then died, of a\u00a0 single wound, a stab under the left armpit made by a pointed instrument.<\/p><p>In\u00a0 addition to\u00a0 the testimony of these witnesses, other evidence was offered by the prosecution tending to corroborate the main\u00a0 facts herein before\u00a0 stated,\u00a0 which it is not necessary at this time to review.<\/p><p>The defense did not deny the existence at one time of illicit relations between the appellant Locson and the deceased, nor that the criminal proceedings above mentioned were, pending at the time of the woman's death, nor that the trip was taken in the vehicle on\u00a0 the night of the 3d of December, 1909, substantially as above\u00a0 set out, except that the witnesses called by the defense undertook to show that the party arrived in\u00a0 Talisay considerably earlier in the night than the time indicated by the witnesses who claimed to have seen the arrival, the three defendants\u00a0 testifying that Dominga Treyes was unhurt when they left\u00a0 her in Talisay.\u00a0 The theory of counsel for the defense in the court below and\u00a0 on this appeal is that the evidence points to one Demetrio, called by the witnesses\u00a0 \"Dimit,\" an uncle of the deceased woman, as the man\u00a0 who killed her, his motive, as they would make it appear, being the\u00a0 feeling of\u00a0 animosity and enmity which he had for\u00a0 the defendant and\u00a0 appellant Locson, who had seduced his niece, and his rage\u00a0 when he learned that, while criminal proceedings were pending against Locson, based on a complaint filed by her, she had accompanied him in his vehicle from Bacplod to Talisay.<\/p><p>Without undertaking\u00a0 to review the evidence at length,\u00a0 it is\u00a0 sufficient for us to say that\u00a0 we are all agreed with the court below that the evidence introduced\u00a0 by the defense fails to support this theory of the\u00a0 death of the deceased; and accepting the findings\u00a0 of the trial court as\u00a0 to the credibility of the\u00a0 various witnesses\u00a0 who\u00a0 testified before him, we must conclude that the facts touching the death of Dominga Treyes are substantially those herein before\u00a0 set out.<\/p><p>There is no evidence whatever in the record which casts any light upon the circumstances surrounding the striking of the fatal blow, and we are agreed with the trial judge that there is nothing in the record to sustain the allegations of premeditation and treachery as set out in the information. There seems to be no doubt that the woman started on the journey\u00a0 from Bacolod of\u00a0 her own\u00a0 free will and accord, believing that her former lover was going to take her to her home in Talisay.\u00a0 Just why she should\u00a0 consent to accompany him\u00a0 notwithstanding the fact\u00a0 that\u00a0 she\u00a0 had filed a complaint against him in\u00a0 the Court\u00a0 of\u00a0 First Instance, is not apparent.\u00a0 He himself testified that the trip was undertaken by him with the hope of effecting a\u00a0 compromise of the criminal proceedings which had been instituted against him, and that it was his intention to take her to Silay and have her\u00a0 enter into\u00a0 a settlement\u00a0 of the case before his uncle, Vicente Gamboa, a notary public.\u00a0 All three of the accused testified that this was the object of the trip.\u00a0 The evidence discloses that there was\u00a0 some\u00a0 discussion\u00a0 of this matter between Locson and the woman on the journey from Bacolod to Talisay, and that Locson tried to persuade her to go to Silay, but that she refused\u00a0 to do so.\u00a0\u00a0 He was insistent and she was unyielding in her refusal.\u00a0 The seduction case was set for trial, and a hearing was to be had in a few days. Locson was interested in effecting some sort of compromise, and since all the witnesses for the defense agree on this point, we see no reason to doubt that this was the object of the trip, and that he was thwarted in his plans.\u00a0 Nothing in the record indicates that there was a\u00a0 prearranged\u00a0 plan to take the life of the unfortunate woman, and it would seen probable at least that the fatal blow was inflicted during an outburst of passion in a moment of disappointed\u00a0 rage and anger because of the woman's refusal to\u00a0 go to Silay, there to make a settlement\u00a0 of the criminal proceedings.\u00a0\u00a0 But, however\u00a0 this may have been, there can\u00a0 be no reasonable doubt that the fatal blow was struck by Locson, and while it is possible that a conspiracy had\u00a0 been entered into by the party who took her in the vehicle to take her life if she refused to agree to compromise the\u00a0 criminal proceedings, we agree with the trial court that the\u00a0 evidence does not sustain a finding to that effect.\u00a0 In\u00a0 our opinion, it tends rather to indicate that the blow was struck by Locson without deliberate\u00a0 premeditation,\u00a0 and that his companions in the vehicle had no part in\u00a0 the\u00a0 commission of that crime. There is nothing in the\u00a0 record which indicates that Penetrante was a coprincipal or an accomplice.\u00a0\u00a0 He seems to have\u00a0 accompanied Locson as a sort of cockero or servant in attendance, and there is no evidence on which to base a finding that he in any wise aided his master in striking the fatal\u00a0 blow.<\/p><p>The trial court found him guilty as an accomplice, but we do not think\u00a0 that the mere fact\u00a0 that he was present in the vehicle when\u00a0 the fatal blow was struck, and that after it was struck he continued to accompany the .party to the home of the wounded woman to which she was aided by her assailant, is sufficient to show that there was any such cooperation on his part in the striking of the blow as\u00a0 would be necessary to make him an accessory to the crime under the decisions of this court.<\/p><p>Discussing facts very similar to those proven in this case, we have heretofore held that:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The mere presence of the defendant at\u00a0 the time and place\u00a0 of the commission of the crime is not of itself sufficient to show such\u00a0 an act of simultaneous cooperation as to make such a defendant an accessory to\u00a0 the crime.\"\u00a0 (U.

Rep., 528.)<\/p><p>\"Where one of two persons\u00a0 jointly\u00a0 engaged in a quarrel with others stabs and kills one of his opponents, his companion could\u00a0 not be held as principal or accomplice where it does not appear that there was some concerted\u00a0 action leading up to the striking of\u00a0 the\u00a0 fatal blow, or that\u00a0 said companion\u00a0 had any reason to\u00a0 believe that a deadly\u00a0 attack was to be made on the deceased.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (U.

Pomar, as receiver,\u00a0 against\u00a0 the order of the Hon.\u00a0 Albert E.\u00a0 McCabe, judge of the Province of Occidental Negros, disallowing certain items in the final\u00a0 account of the said receiver.<p>It appears from the record that the defendant, Romana Gauzon, on the 10th day of September, 1904, executed and delivered\u00a0 to the plaintiff (Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos de Filipinas) a mortgage upon\u00a0 an hacienda known as \"San Jose,\" in the municipality of\u00a0 San Carlos, in the Province of Occidental Negros.\u00a0 The said defendant (Romana Gauzon) having failed to pay the said mortgage, the plaintiff (Compa\u00f1ia General de\u00a0 Tabacos de Filipinas),\u00a0 on the 22d day of September, 1905,\u00a0 commenced an action for\u00a0 the foreclosure of said mortgage, and asked, in addition to\u00a0 the foreclosure of the mortgage, that a receiver be appointed to take charge of the property in question, pending the said action.\u00a0 On the same day\u00a0 (22d of September, 1905) the Hon. Vicente Jocson, after hearing the petition\u00a0 filed\u00a0 in\u00a0 said cause, appointed the said defendant,\u00a0 Juan B. Pomar, an employee of the plaintiff, receiver of the property involved in said foreclosure proceedings.\u00a0 Said foreclosure proceedings continued to\u00a0 a termination.\u00a0 The result of said\u00a0 proceedings may be found in two decisions\u00a0 of this court, the cases of La Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> Ganson (13 Phil. Rep., 472)\u00a0 and La Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas <em>vs<\/em>.

Pomar.<\/p><p>After the termination of\u00a0 the\u00a0 receivership, the court required of the receiver (Juan D. Pomar) a report and an accounting of his operations as receiver.\u00a0 It appears from the record that the lower court had a good deal of trouble in securing a final.report.\u00a0\u00a0 The receiver apparently acted as though his only responsibility was to the\u00a0 plaintiff (Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas) ; however, finally the lower court secured what appears to be\u00a0 a final accounting by the receiver,\u00a0 upon the 9th or 10th\u00a0 day of August, 1909.\u00a0 The report of the receiver contained many items. After a careful consideration of the various items of the account of the receiver, Judge McCabe allowed the following items of said account -<\/p><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan=\"2\">1.

Pomar, to pay into court on\u00a0 or about the first Tuesday of November, 1909, the sum of P7,883.76, a balance which he ought to have had in his possession.\u00a0 From the order allowing said items\u00a0 only\u00a0 the defendant appealed to this court and made\u00a0 the following assignments of error:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"I.\u00a0 The court erred in reducing to P8,565.97 the\u00a0 P22,944.73 spent\u00a0 by the\u00a0 receiver for\u00a0 cutting,\u00a0 hauling, and manufacture of 8,005.58 piculs of sugar, for packing, transportation\u00a0 and storage thereof, and insurance and selling commission thereon.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"II.\u00a0 The court erred in not allowing the item of P147.86 paid out by the receiver as interest on money borrowed to cover the first expenses of\u00a0 his receivership.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"III. The court erred in\u00a0 not approving the disbursement made by the receiver of the P3.001.94 delivered to the <em>aparceros<\/em> as their share of the crop.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"IV. The court erred in reducing to Pl,000 the P4,860.87 which the receiver claimed as compensation for his\u00a0 services.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"V. The court erred in holding that the order appointing the receiver does not extend his powers beyond those prescribed in section 175 of Act No. 190.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>With reference to the first assignment of error, it will be noted that the receiver presented an account for cutting, grinding, etc., of the sugar cane upon the hacienda, over which he had control as receiver, amounting to P22,944.73. Judge McCabe refused to allow that amount for the cutting and grinding, etc., of said sugar cane, upon the ground that it was an unreasonable charge.\u00a0 The parties\u00a0 in the lower court agreed to the appointment of three commissioners for the purpose of ascertaining the reasonable cost of cutting, grinding, etc., of the sugar cane upon the said hacienda. The commissioners were duly appointed, the plaintiff selecting one, the defendant another and the court\u00a0 selecting the third.\u00a0 In due time and after due deliberation, the\u00a0 commissioners reported that the reasonable cost for cutting, grinding, etc., of the said sugar cane per pico was P1.07.\u00a0 There were 8,005.58\u00a0 picos of sugar cane, which calculated at the rate of P1.07 per\u00a0 pico for cutting, grinding, etc., would amount to P8,565.97, which amount the lower court allowed the receiver.\u00a0 The\u00a0 commissioners appointed by the lower court were men who\u00a0 had had\u00a0 experience\u00a0 in\u00a0 the cutting and grinding of sugar cane. It was the duty of the receiver to harvest the sugar cane at the least possible cost to the owners of the crop.\u00a0 There is much proof in the record to indicate that the receiver did not harvest the crop of sugar cane as expeditiously\u00a0 as\u00a0 he\u00a0 should have done.\u00a0 There is no proof in the\u00a0 record which\u00a0 shows that the amount estimated by the said commissioners for the cutting, grinding, etc.\u00a0 of the sugar cane in question, was\u00a0 not a reasonable amount for that expense.\u00a0 We find nothing in the record which justifies us in\u00a0 modifying the decision of the lower court with reference to this first assignment of error.<\/p><p>With reference to the second assignment of error, it appears that the receiver attempted to charge F147.86, as interest on money borrowed by him during his administration\u00a0 as receiver.\u00a0 There is no proof in the record that the receiver was authorized to borrow money for the purpose of carrying\u00a0 on\u00a0 his work as receiver\u00a0 of said hacienda; neither is there\u00a0 any proof in the record which shows that it was\u00a0 necessary for\u00a0 him to borrow money to properly conserve the interests of the owners and creditors interested in the administration\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 hacienda.\u00a0\u00a0 The lower court correctly said, \"a receiver has no authority to borrow money unless the same is expressly given by the court.\"\u00a0 We would be inclined, however, to allow this amount\u00a0 (P147.86) had the necessity been\u00a0 fully demonstrated\u00a0 for\u00a0 borrowing the money.\u00a0 In the\u00a0 absence of authority expressly given and especially in the absence of proof of the absolute necessity for incurring this item of expense, we refuse to modify the conclusions of the lower court\u00a0 with respect to this item.<\/p><p>With reference to the third assignment of error above noted,\u00a0 the receiver included in\u00a0 his account the item\u00a0 of P3,001.94,\u00a0 being the amount,\u00a0 according to this statement, of money and effects delivered to \"<em>los aparceros de la hacienda<\/em>\" during\u00a0 his administration.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is\u00a0 a well known custom among sugar\u00a0 growers in the Philippine Islands, that the aparceros\u00a0 plant and cultivate sugar cane at their own expense, receiving one-half of the sugar produced and delivering the other half to the owner of the land.\u00a0 It is also a\u00a0 well\u00a0 known custom that the owners of the\u00a0 land from time to time\u00a0 advance money and effects to the <em>aparceros<\/em>,\u00a0 deducting the value of the same from the value of the sugar after the same is harvested.\u00a0 In the present case it appears that the receiver delivered one-half of the sugar to the<em> aparceros<\/em>\u00a0 without deducting\u00a0 the amount of money and effects advanced to them.\u00a0 If he, in fact, advanced to the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">aparceros<\/span> the\u00a0 said sum\u00a0 (P3,001.94) he should have deducted it from the amount due said <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">aparceros<\/span>, and not have attempted to\u00a0 collect the same\u00a0 from the amount due the owner of the hacienda, prejudicing the\u00a0 owner of the hacienda\u00a0 thereby.\u00a0 Here\u00a0 again the\u00a0 receiver exceeded\u00a0 his authority.\u00a0 Nevertheless we would be inclined to allow this amount (P3,001.94) if it were a just charge against the administration\u00a0 of the\u00a0 hacienda.\u00a0 But, as was said above, it is not a just charge against the owner of the hacienda. This amount should have been collected from the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">aparceros<\/span>. Judge McCabe committed no error in disallowing this item in the account of the receiver.<\/p><p>With reference to the fourth assignment of error above noted,\u00a0 it\u00a0 will be seen that the receiver included in his account the sum of P4,860.87 as compensation for his administration as receiver.\u00a0\u00a0 The lower court disallowed that amount but did allow\u00a0 him. the sum\u00a0 of P1,000 as his just compensation as receiver.\u00a0 The lower court, in the appointment of the receiver,\u00a0 did not fix any sum\u00a0 for his compensation ; neither is it customary for courts in appointing receivers to fix their compensation in advance. Their compensation\u00a0 is\u00a0 a matter\u00a0 which is always left to the sound discretion of the court, to be allowed from time to time. The receiver attempted to recover as his compensation 15 per cent of the value of the sugar.\u00a0 The lower court found that the amount of P4,860.87\u00a0 was an unreasonable amount to be allowed as compensation for the services of the receiver in the present case.\u00a0 The court found that the receiver might have done all the work which he did do in the course of his administration as receiver in one hundred days.\u00a0 The Code of Procedure in Civil Actions allows administrators of estates of deceased persons the sum of P4 a day for the time actually employed in the administration of the estate. The lower court, following: this provision of the law, believing the present case to be somewhat analogous, allowed the receiver P4 a day for his services.\u00a0\u00a0 The lower court also allowed an additional amount, the basis of which does not clearly appear in the record, making the total compensation of the receiver the sum of P1,000.\u00a0\u00a0 Against that order the owner of the hacienda did not\u00a0 appeal.\u00a0 Considering the negligent manner in\u00a0 which the receiver administered the hacienda, as appears\u00a0 from the record,\u00a0 as well as his negligence in complying\u00a0 with the various orders of the court with\u00a0 reference to rendering accounts,\u00a0 etc., we are of the opinion that the sum of P1,000 is, in fact, more than a just compensation\u00a0 for\u00a0 his services.\u00a0 In\u00a0 view, however, of the fact that the owner of the hacienda did not appeal from the order of the court allowing said sum (P1,000) we approve the finding of the lower court.<\/p><p>With reference to\u00a0 the\u00a0 fifth assignment of\u00a0 error above noted, the appellant seems to believe that section 175 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions gave him full power to administer the property placed under his control as receiver as he might deem wise and necessary, without any intervention on the part of the court or of the interested parties. The appellant evidently overlooked the phrase of said article which says: \"The receiver shall have,<em> under the control of the court in which the action is pending,<\/em> power, etc.\"\u00a0 The judge of the lower court in\u00a0 his decision\u00a0 goes into detail at length and cites authorities extensively, for the purpose of showing the\u00a0 general duties, powers\u00a0 and responsibilities of\u00a0 receivers,\u00a0 evidently\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose\u00a0 of instructing receivers in his\u00a0 district.\u00a0 The receiver\u00a0 is generally defined to be \"an\u00a0 indifferent person\u00a0 between the parties litigant, appointed\u00a0 by the court and\u00a0 on behalf\u00a0 of all the parties, and not of the plaintiff or defendant only, to\u00a0 receive and hold the thing or property\u00a0 in litigation,\u00a0 pending the suit (Booth <em>vs.<\/em> Clark, 17 How.

Proceedings were had\u00a0 upon the contest before the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 respondent judge, in accordance with the provisions of section 27 of Act No. 1582, and\u00a0 on\u00a0 the 9th of March,. 1910, the respondent judge\u00a0 rendered judgment in favor of the contestant, Arnedo, and issued\u00a0 his mandate to the board of canvassers, directing it to Correct its canvass in accordance with the facts found by him.\u00a0\u00a0 By this decision\u00a0 the\u00a0 court gave a majority\u00a0 of the votes legally cast to Arnedo. On the same day the clerk of the\u00a0 court, acting in conformity with the provisions of the Election Law, sent to the Executive Secretary a notice of the \"determination\" of the\u00a0 contest. The board of canvassers on the 11th of March\u00a0 corrected its canvass in\u00a0 accordance with the mandate of the court. About twenty days after the rendition and execution of the judgment of the\u00a0 trial court Liongson's attorney filed with the clerk of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Court of First Instance of the Province of Pampanga a motion for \"a reconsideration and revision\" of the judgment theretofore rendered.\u00a0\u00a0 Some time thereafter,\u00a0 written arguments were\u00a0 submitted by both\u00a0 parties, counsel for Arnedo insisting that the court had\u00a0 no jurisdiction to grant\u00a0 the prayer of the motion.\u00a0 On\u00a0 June 29, 1910, the respondent judge vacated his\u00a0 former judgment and entered a new judgment, in which he announced that he had changed his opinion\u00a0 with respect to the conclusions to be drawn from the evidence, and thereupon a, new order was issued to the board of canvassers, directing them to recanvass the votes\u00a0 in\u00a0 accordance with\u00a0 the new findings made by him.\u00a0 The new judgment held\u00a0 Liongson to have received a majority of 15 votes\u00a0 over Arnedo.<br\/><br\/>From this\u00a0 statement of facts, it is\u00a0 clear that the precise question for determination in this action is whether\u00a0 a Court of First Instance, which has rendered judgment in an election protest\u00a0 in the course of proceedings\u00a0 had under and by virtue of\u00a0 the provisions\u00a0 of section 27 of Act No.\u00a0 1582, which\u00a0 has issued\u00a0 its\u00a0 mandamus, directed to the\u00a0 board of canvassers to correct its\u00a0 canvass\u00a0 in\u00a0 accordance\u00a0 with the facts found, and whose clerk has given notice of the determination\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 contest to the Executive Secretary, has jurisdiction thereafter to reopen or vacate such judgment, and grant a new trial of the contest or to enter a new and different\u00a0 judgment, and issue\u00a0 a second mandamus to the board of\u00a0 canvassers, on the ground that in\u00a0 rendering the former judgment the court erred in its findings on the facts or in its\u00a0 application\u00a0 of the law to the facts found.\u00a0 This question must, we think, be answered in the negative.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 contended that not only is the right so to do, in the absence of express statutory authority, a sort of inherent power of the\u00a0 court, arising out of the proper exercise of control over its\u00a0 own\u00a0 judgments, but that this right is expressly conferred upon the court in election-contest proceedings during\u00a0 the term at which the election contest was heard, under the provisions of section\u00a0 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure. We shall first examine the claim of an inherent right in courts in these Islands, in the absence of statutory authority, to vacate their judgments, and enter new judgments; but in our consideration of this question it must be understood that what it said is limited to vacations of final judgments and\u00a0 entries of new judgments upon new trial or otherwise, wherein the vacated\u00a0 judgment is changed or modified in any\u00a0 matter of substance or in any matter\u00a0 affecting the merits,\u00a0 as a result of an attempt by the court to correct errors of law or\u00a0 of fact into which the court itself may have fallen\u00a0 in\u00a0 rendering the\u00a0 original vacated judgment.\u00a0 The right of the courts in\u00a0 certain cases to amend clerical errors or omissions in their judgments, to set aside void judgments and\u00a0 judgments\u00a0 fraudulently procured, and to make their judgments as\u00a0 entered conform to their judgments as actually rendered,\u00a0 rests on different\u00a0 principles,\u00a0 and need not now be considered, because in the case at bar the trial court avowedly\u00a0 set aside its former\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 and entered the new judgment on\u00a0 the ground that in entering the former judgment it had fallen into error in its application of the law to the facts\u00a0 proven.<br\/><br\/>In support of\u00a0 this claim\u00a0 of inherent power\u00a0 in the court below to vacate\u00a0 its judgments,\u00a0 and enter new judgments, we are cited to the practice of\u00a0 the courts of\u00a0 England and the United States, from whence our judicial and procedural system is in large measure adopted; and it is true that except so far as statutory changes and modifications of the ancient \"term system\" of procedure has necessitated\u00a0 modification of the doctrine, the records,\u00a0 in\u00a0 jurisdictions wherein\u00a0 the ancient \"term system\" has been continued\u00a0 in force, remain subject to the\u00a0 revision of the court throughout the term, and\u00a0 during that period the judgment itself may be altered, revised, or revoked, in matters both of form and substance. In the quaint\u00a0 language of Coke,\u00a0 the\u00a0 doctrine was thus expounded:<br\/><blockquote>\"During the\u00a0 terme wherein any judicial act\u00a0 is done,\u00a0 the record remaineth\u00a0 in the brest of the judges of the court, and in their remembrance, and therefore the roll is alterable during that teime, as the judges shall direct; but when\u00a0 the terme is past, then the record is in the roll, and admitteth no alteration, averment, or proof to the contrarie.\" <br\/><\/blockquote>Freeman in his woik on Judgments, volume I, paragraph 69,\u00a0 informs us that of the law thus laid\u00a0 down, the only part remaining unshaken to the present time is, that during the term, the proceedings remain in the breast of the judges, and the judgments entered during the term may therefore be vacated and amended by the court in matters of substance as well as in matters of form throughout that period. But the \"term system\" of procedure and practice which was in force in\u00a0 England and in the\u00a0 United States when this doctrine was\u00a0 announced\u00a0 has\u00a0 never been imported into this jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 While our Code of Procedure adopts\u00a0 the word term for\u00a0 the purpose of designating\u00a0 certain subdivisions of time in the various courts of the Islands, by reference to which the records of\u00a0 the courts can conveniently be kept, and the time of the sittings of the sessions of the court and of certain\u00a0 proceedings had\u00a0 therein\u00a0 can conveniently be designated, nevertheless, it is quite clear from a review of our entire\u00a0 judicial\u00a0 and procedural system, and especially of the provisions requiring that the courts, \"shall be always open,\u00a0 legal holidays and nonjud'cial days excepted,\" that neither the ancient system of terms and final adjournments under which judicial business was conducted in England, and continues to be conducted in many jurisdictions in the United States, nor the incidents inherent in and peculiar to\u00a0 such a system of procedure, were intended to be carried over into the system of courts and civil procedure\u00a0 implanted in these\u00a0 Islands.\u00a0\u00a0 (Garcia <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.

Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Cole, 1 Wash., 330.)\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Cuna (12 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 241),\u00a0 we said that \"neither English nor American common law is in force in these Islands,\u00a0 nor are the\u00a0 doctrines derived therefrom binding upon our courts, save only in so far\u00a0 as they are founded on\u00a0 sound principles applicable to\u00a0 local\u00a0 conditions, and are not in conflict with existing law.\" This <i>rule of practice<\/i> of the common law can not\u00a0 therefore be deemed to have any controlling force in this jurisdiction,\u00a0 wherein\u00a0 there\u00a0 are no \"terms of court,\" in the\u00a0 sense in which they are contemplated in the\u00a0 rule.<br\/><br\/>But it is said that, admitting it to be true\u00a0 that the <i>rule of practice<\/i> of the common\u00a0 law has no application in this jurisdiction, nevertheless\u00a0 the courts, from\u00a0 the very\u00a0 nature of their organization and of the duty imposed upon them of adjudicating\u00a0 all questions submitted to\u00a0 them in accordance with the facts and\u00a0 the law\u00a0 applicable thereto, must be\u00a0 deemed to have inherent power over their own\u00a0 judgments to correct errors into which the court may have fallen as to the facts or the law, if not for the term,\u00a0 then at least for a reasonable time after the entry of final\u00a0 judgment, to be fixed by the court in its\u00a0 discretion, as may be required by the varying circumstances of each case.<br\/><br\/>We do not think so, if\u00a0 by this proposition\u00a0 it is claimed that a final judgment upon which, under\u00a0 the statute,\u00a0 the prevailing party is entitled\u00a0 as of right to\u00a0 have\u00a0 execution issue, can be\u00a0 vacated\u00a0 for the purpose\u00a0 of\u00a0 correcting such errors.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 true\u00a0 that it is the\u00a0 purpose and\u00a0 intention of the law that courts should decide all questions\u00a0 submitted to them \"as truth and justice require,\"\u00a0 and that it is greatly to be desired that all judgments should be so decided; but controlling and irresistible\u00a0 reasons of public policy and\u00a0 of sound practice in the courts demand that at\u00a0 the risk\u00a0 of occasional error, judgments of courts determining controversies submitted to them should become final at some definite time fixed by law, or by a rule of practice\u00a0 recognized by law, so as to be thereafter beyond the control\u00a0 even of the court which rendered them for the purpose of correcting errors of fact or of law, into which,\u00a0 in the opinion of the court it may have fallen. ^The very purpose\u00a0 for which the courts are organized is\u00a0 to put an end to controversy,\u00a0 to decide the questions submitted to the litigants, and to determine the respective rights of\u00a0 the\u00a0 parties.\u00a0\u00a0 With the full knowledge that courts are not infallible, the litigants submit their respective claims for judgment,\u00a0 and they have a right at some time or other to have final judgment on which they can rely as a final disposition of the issue submitted, and\u00a0 to know that there is an end to the litigation.\u00a0 \"If a vacillating, irresolute judge were allowed to\u00a0 thus keep causes ever within his power, to determine and redetermine them term after term, to bandy his judgments about from one party .to the other, and to\u00a0 change his conclusions\u00a0 as\u00a0 freely and as capriciously as a chameleon may change its hues, then litiation might become more intolerable than the wrongs\u00a0 it is intended to redress.\"\u00a0 And no words would be sufficient to portray the disastrous consequences which would follow the recognition of unbridled power in\u00a0 a court which has the misfortune to be\u00a0 presided\u00a0 over by\u00a0 a venal and corrupt judge, to\u00a0 vacate and amend, in matters of substance, final judgments already entered.<br\/><br\/>It is no answer to what\u00a0 has\u00a0 just been said\u00a0 to point to the fact that in England and the United States the\u00a0 right to set aside judgments and grant new\u00a0 trials\u00a0 during the term at which they are entered has always been recognized, and that in some States this right has been extended even beyond the term by express statutory enactment.\u00a0 We do not question the wisdom or validity of the common-law rule in jurisdictions wherein it is applicable, and to which it has been extended, nor\u00a0 of statutes expressly conferring jurisdiction upon the courts to grant new trials within\u00a0 a fixed period\u00a0 after the entry of final judgment; our objections are exclusively directed to the claim of an inherent right in the\u00a0 courts to set aside final judgments entered by them, and to enter new judgments or grant new trials for an indefinite period of time after\u00a0 the entry of the original judgment: the length of\u00a0 such period to be fixed in the discretion of the court,\u00a0 and not definitely fixed by law, or\u00a0 by some known rule of practice recognized by law.\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, the very reasoning which we have adopted in combating this claim of inherent\u00a0 power is the\u00a0 reasoning upon which the right is denied to the courts in England and the United States to vacate final judgments and grant\u00a0 new trials\u00a0 after the expiration of the period prescribed by\u00a0 statute or authorized by the common-law\u00a0 rule of practice.<br\/><br\/>Under\u00a0 the system of procedure in force in\u00a0 these Islands before the new Code of Civil Procedure went into effect, the courts were expressly denied the right to change, modify or correct their judgments after they\u00a0 fiad been\u00a0 filed and\u00a0 the parties thereto notified except for\u00a0 the purpose\u00a0 of correcting certain specified clerical\u00a0 errors, and even\u00a0 this right was limited to\u00a0 a period\u00a0 of twenty-four\u00a0 hours after the parties\u00a0 have been notified of the\u00a0 filing of the judgment. We are of opinion, however,\u00a0 that under the new system\u00a0 of procedure and organization of the courts no such rigid\u00a0 limitation\u00a0 on the right to amend and vacate judgments is prescribed\u00a0 by law or required by sound rules of practice: for while on the one hand the common-law\u00a0 rule\u00a0 under\u00a0 which plenary control over\u00a0 its judgments is held to be in all\u00a0 courts during the term wherein they are entered is not applicable here for the reasons above stated, on the other hand, the reasons for denying to courts the right to set final judgments aside in their discretion do\u00a0 not\u00a0 demand or require\u00a0 the denial to the courts of plenary control over the proceedings, including\u00a0 the judgment, up to the moment when the judgment becomes final in the sense that the party in\u00a0 whose favor it is rendered is entitled to execution thereon \"as of right.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Our\u00a0 statutes definitely\u00a0 prescribe the\u00a0 time when executions may issue as of right and\u00a0 does\u00a0 not\u00a0 leave\u00a0 its determination to the discretion of the\u00a0 court.\u00a0 Up\u00a0 to this time none of the parties can be said to have acquired any definite right in or to the judgment, and they have no just cause of\u00a0 complaint if prior thereto the court\u00a0 takes such action as\u00a0 may be necessary to correct any error into which in its opinion it may have fallen,\u00a0 and if an appeal\u00a0 lies from the judgment, such action on the part of the court\u00a0 may well avoid unnecessary and wasteful expense and delay incident to an appeal,\u00a0 reversal, and new trial. <br\/>'<br\/>We are satisfied that the rule of practice thus laid down for the courts in this jurisdiction is in strict accord with the spirit which informs the procedural law,\u00a0 both criminal and civil, as introduced into these Islands\u00a0 by the present sovereign; and that it finds its justification in the same line of reasoning applied to\u00a0 the system of\u00a0 organization of the courts and the procedural law in this jurisdiction, as that which gave rise to the common-law rule of practice in\u00a0 the jurisdiction wherein it has its origin.<br\/><br\/>General Orders,\u00a0 No. 58, which\u00a0 implanted\u00a0 a new\u00a0 system of criminal procedure in these Islands, and continues substantially unamended as the procedural law in criminal cases, expressly provides for the reopening of these cases \"on account of errors of Jaw committed\u00a0 at the trial,\" \"at\u00a0 any time before the final\u00a0 entry of a judgment for conviction;\" that is to\u00a0 say, before the expiration of the period allowed\u00a0 for the taking of an appeal, or in the language of the rule we have just\u00a0 laid down, before the prosecution can have execution upon the judgment of conviction, \"as of right.\"\u00a0 At the time when these General Orders were promulgated\u00a0 the time within which judgments\u00a0 of conviction\u00a0 might\u00a0 be\u00a0 set aside could not have been fixed by reference to the running of a term of the\u00a0 court,\u00a0 as the phrase \"the running of a term,\" if used with reference to the system of organization of the courts then\u00a0 in existence, would have been\u00a0 a\u00a0 wholly meaningless expression.<br\/><br\/>Section 145 of the new Code of Civil Procedure, hereinafter set out at length, which contains the express\u00a0 grant of authority in our procedural law to set aside civil judgments and grant new trials, limits this express authority\u00a0 to judgments rendered in actions, and limits the time during which this express grant\u00a0 of\u00a0 authority\u00a0 may be\u00a0 exercised to the term at which the judgment was rendered, the word\u00a0 term as used in\u00a0 this section referring,\u00a0 of course, to\u00a0 the\u00a0 subdivision of time provided for by our statutes as hereinbefore explained.\u00a0 But this court, in a long line of decisions giving effect\u00a0 to the somewhat contradictory code provisions for the perfection of appeals, has held that it is the duty of the court to entertain motions\u00a0 for a new trial after the entry of judgment, and until the time has elapsed within which, under the provisions of section\u00a0 143, the parties are required to inform the\u00a0 court of their\u00a0 intention\u00a0 to\u00a0 prosecute their bill of exceptions; and this <i>notwithstanding the fact that in the meantime the\u00a0 term at which the judgment was entered may have expired.<\/i>\u00a0 These rulings clearly recognize in the Court\u00a0 of First Instance power to entertain motions for a new trial, independent\u00a0 of that conferred in section 145 of the code, and not necessarily\u00a0 limited to the term wherein the judgment was entered.\u00a0 We think that the true limitation as to time within which\u00a0 this power\u00a0 is vested in the courts is the expiration of the period within which a bill of exceptions may be perfected, or in other words of the period during which, under the\u00a0 provisions of section\u00a0 144 of the code, execution\u00a0 may not issue,\u00a0 \"except by\u00a0 special order of the court.\"<br\/><br\/>So under\u00a0 the\u00a0 provisions of Act No. 867, wherein provision is made for the filing of final judgments rendered by judges after they\u00a0 have left the province wherein the\u00a0 case was tried, and for the forwarding\u00a0 of such judgments by mail to the\u00a0 clerk of the proper\u00a0 court for entry, it would seem quite clear that the\u00a0 right\u00a0 to be heard\u00a0 on a motion for a new trial could not, in the nature of things, be limited to the term at which the judgment is entered, and that the time within which this right may be exercised in such cases must be held to coincide\u00a0 with the period therein\u00a0 allowed for the\u00a0 perfection of appeals\u00a0 in\u00a0 such\u00a0 cases; or in\u00a0 other words, that the right is not necessarily limited\u00a0 by the expiration of a particular term, but by the lapse of the period during which execution may not issue \"as of right.\"<br\/><br\/>Again, since\u00a0 the express authority to\u00a0 grant\u00a0 new\u00a0 trials under the provisions\u00a0 of section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure is limited to cases wherein the judgments thus set aside are rendered\u00a0 in\u00a0 \"actions,\" it is\u00a0 clear that this section can have no direct application in cases wherein\u00a0 the question is one\u00a0 of setting\" aside\u00a0 judgments, orders, and decrees entered\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 special proceedings\u00a0 dealt with\u00a0 in Part II of the code, or decrees adjudicating title in the Courts of Land Registration, or\u00a0 in any\u00a0 other proceeding which does not fall under the definition of the word \"action,\"\u00a0 as found in section 1 of the\u00a0 code.\u00a0 But the\u00a0 mere\u00a0 failure\u00a0 expressly\u00a0 to confer\u00a0 upon the courts\u00a0 the power to\u00a0 grant new trials in this numerous class of cases should not and can not be construed as a denial to the courts in these\u00a0 Islands of the\u00a0 jurisdiction\u00a0 to\u00a0 grant\u00a0 new\u00a0 trials\u00a0 so\u00a0 universally recognized in the system\u00a0 of\u00a0 procedure\u00a0 in England and the United States from whence the body of our\u00a0 procedural law has been adopted, so\u00a0 far as\u00a0 such jurisdiction is not inconsistent with\u00a0 the\u00a0 general system of procedural law\u00a0 in force in these Islands.\u00a0 Indeed the right to vacate such judgments and\u00a0 grant new trials\u00a0 has\u00a0 always been\u00a0 freely exercised by the courts throughout\u00a0 the Islands, and the only questions in respect to this very salutory practice which are properly open for consideration at\u00a0 this time are the limitations\u00a0 and\u00a0 restrictions under\u00a0 which the\u00a0 right\u00a0 should\u00a0 be exercised.\u00a0 And\u00a0 while we\u00a0 can not\u00a0 have\u00a0 recourse\u00a0 to the common-law\u00a0 rule\u00a0 of practice which is\u00a0 predicated\u00a0 on the so-called \"term system\" of procedure and practice in determining these limitations and\u00a0 restrictions,\u00a0 we think that applying to our system of procedure and practice the reasoning upon which that rule\u00a0 is based, which is as\u00a0 applicable here as in England or the United States, the plenary power of the court over its proceedings in the absence\u00a0 of express statute, must be held to terminate when the judgment becomes final in the sense that the party in whose favor the judgment is rendered is entitled to have execution thereon as of right.<br\/><br\/>Under the ancient \"term system,\"\u00a0 by a sort of fiction devised for the purpose of securing uniformity in the procedure, the entire term was\u00a0 deemed\u00a0 to\u00a0 consist of but one day, and\u00a0 everything which was done throughout the term was treated as though it had been done on that day.\u00a0\u00a0 While the clerk kept notes and memoranda of all that occurred, the judgment roll\u00a0 or record in each\u00a0 case was not formally prepared\u00a0 until the end of the term, and not until then was the judgment formally entered by the clerk.\u00a0 The judgment having been thus formally entered, and the judgment roll having been deposited in the treasury\u00a0 of the proper court, it was thereafter deemed to be beyond the further\u00a0 control of the court, and everything properly\u00a0 made a part of the roll was said to \"import absolute verity.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Coke, and the older writers, explained the\u00a0 common-law rule of practice under which the courts of record were said\u00a0 to have plenary control\u00a0 over the proceedings\u00a0 and the\u00a0 judgment prior to the expiration of the term by a reference to these various steps in the preparation of\u00a0 the judgment roll.\u00a0 But the basic reason on which\u00a0 the rule rested would\u00a0 appear to be that, as a result of the fact that the judgment roll was not made\u00a0 up until the close of the term, no execution could issue on a judgment until the end of\u00a0 the term at which the judgment was rendered, unless specially directed by the court to\u00a0 be issued\u00a0 at an earlier\u00a0 period for special cause, and\u00a0 \"a capacity to issue execution on\u00a0 a judgment at\u00a0 law implies its finality,\u00a0 unless there be something to repel the implication in the terms\u00a0 of the law which gives the capacity.\"\u00a0 (Enders'\u00a0 Executors\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i>\u00a0 Burch,\u00a0\u00a0 15\u00a0 Grattan\u00a0 (Va.), 64.)\u00a0\u00a0 In the decision\u00a0 of\u00a0 the case just\u00a0 cited in a common-law State by a court learned in the\u00a0 doctrines and history of the\u00a0 common law, the court held\u00a0 that a statute\u00a0 which authorized the issuance\u00a0 of executions on office judgments on the fifteenth\u00a0 day of\u00a0 the term,\u00a0 upon which theretofore\u00a0 executions could not issue until\u00a0 the last day of the term, abrogated the common-law rule of practice as to those judgments, and deprived the court of the power it had theretofore\u00a0 under\u00a0 the common-law rule of practice to set aside these judgments after the fifteenth day of the term.<br\/><br\/>We conclude, therefore,\u00a0 that in the absence of statutory provisions expressly extending or limiting the time\u00a0 within which the courts in\u00a0 these Islands may vacate judgments and grant new trials or enter new judgments on the ground of error\u00a0 in fact or in\u00a0 law into which\u00a0 the\u00a0 court may be of opinion that it has fallen, these courts have no\u00a0 power thus\u00a0 to vacate judgments\u00a0 after they have become final in the sense that\u00a0 the party in whose favor they are rendered is entitled as of right, to have execution thereon, but that prior thereto the courts have plenary control over the proceedings including the judgment,\u00a0 and in the exercise of a sound judicial\u00a0 discretion may take\u00a0 such proper action in this regard\u00a0 as\u00a0 \"truth and\u00a0 justice require.\"<br\/><br\/>A\u00a0 cursory examination\u00a0 of the statute\u00a0 prescribing the proceedings in election contests, which\u00a0 is hereinafter set out in full, makes it quite\u00a0 clear that the court is required forthwith to give effect to\u00a0 final judgments entered in such contests, or in other words to execute such\u00a0 judgments as soon\u00a0 as entered; and therefore,\u00a0 under\u00a0 the rule just laid down, the court has no inherent power thereafter to\u00a0 vacate such judgments on the\u00a0 ground of error\u00a0 of fact or of law into which in\u00a0 its opinion it may have fallen in rendering them.<br\/><br\/>We\u00a0 come\u00a0 now to consider the contention of respondent that jurisdiction to reopen the judgment\u00a0 in question and to enter a new judgment\u00a0 was expressly conferred upon the court,\u00a0 during the term\u00a0 at\u00a0 which the election contest\u00a0 was heard, under the provisions of section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 That section is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"At any time\u00a0 under\u00a0 the term at which\u00a0 an action has been tried in a Court of First Instance, the judge thereof, may set aside the judgment\u00a0 and grant\u00a0 a new trial, upon such terms as may be just, on the application of the party aggrieved, and after due notice to the adverse party and hearing, for any of the following causes, materially affecting the substantial rights of such party:<br\/><br\/>\"1. Accident or surprise\u00a0 which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against, and by reason of which the party applying has probably been\u00a0 impaired in his rights;<br\/><br\/>\"2. Newly discovered evidence, material to the party making the application, which\u00a0 he could not,\u00a0 with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the trial;<br\/><br\/>\"3. Because the judge has become satisfied that excessive damages have been awarded,\u00a0 or that the evidence was' insufficient to justify the\u00a0 decision, or\u00a0 that it is against the law.\"<\/blockquote>Section 27 of Act No. 1582, which prescribes the proceedings in election contests such\u00a0 as that under\u00a0 consideration is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The assembly\u00a0 shall be the judge of the\u00a0 elections, returns,\u00a0 and qualifications of its members.\u00a0 Contests\u00a0 in all elections for the determination of which provision has not been made otherwise\u00a0 shall be heard by the Court of First Instance having jurisdiction in the judicial district in which the election was held, upon\u00a0 motion by any candidate voted for at such election, which motion must be made within two weeks after the election, and such court shall have exclusive and final jurisdiction and shall\u00a0 forthwith cause the registry lists and\u00a0 all ballots used at\u00a0 such election to be brought before it and examined, and to appoint the necessary officers therefor and to fix their compensation, which shall be payable in the first instance out of the provincial treasury, and to issue its mandamus\u00a0 directed to the boards of canvassers to correct its\u00a0 canvass\u00a0 in accordance with the facts as found.\u00a0\u00a0 If in any case the court shall determine that no person was lawfully\u00a0 elected it shall forthwith\u00a0 so certify to the\u00a0 Governor-General, who shall order a special election to fill the office or offices in question as herein before provided.<br\/><br\/>\"Before\u00a0 the court shall entertain\u00a0 any such motion the party making it shall give a bond in\u00a0 an amount to be fixed by the court with two sureties satisfactory to\u00a0 it, conditioned that he will pay all expenses and costs incident to such motion, or shall deposit cash in court in lieu of such bond.\u00a0 If the party paying such expenses and costs shall be successful they shall be taxed by the court and entered and be collectible as a judgment against the defeated party.<br\/><br\/>\"All proceedings under this section shall be upon motion with notice of not to exceed twenty days to all candidates voted for and not upon pleadings or by action, and shall be heard\u00a0 and determined by the court in the judicial district in which the election was held regardless of whether said court be at the time holding a regular or stated term.\u00a0\u00a0 In such proceedings\u00a0 the registry list as finally corrected\u00a0 by the board of inspectors shall be conclusive\u00a0 as to who\u00a0 was entitled to vote at such\u00a0 election.<br\/><br\/>\"The clerk of the court in which any such contest is instituted\u00a0 shall give immediate notice\u00a0 of its institution and\u00a0 also of the\u00a0 determination\u00a0 thereof to the Executive Secretary.\"<\/blockquote>The contention that\u00a0 section\u00a0 145 of the\u00a0 code\u00a0 expressly confers authority and jurisdiction to vacate judgment in proceedings had on election protests under the above-set-out section 27 of Act No. 1582 might perhaps, be sufficiently refuted by merely calling attention to the language of\u00a0 the code provisions whereby authority to grant new trials is conferred.<br\/><br\/>The code provisions is in terms made applicable to cases in which <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">an action<\/span> has been tried\u00a0 by\u00a0 a Court\u00a0 of First Instance.\u00a0 Section 1 of the code (Act No. 190) defines\u00a0 the word\u00a0 \"action\" as used therein to be\u00a0 \"an ordinary\u00a0 suit in a court of justice, by which one party prosecutes another for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the redress or prevention of a wrong; every other remedy furnished by law is\u00a0 a\u00a0 special proceeding.\"\u00a0 It seems very clear that\u00a0 the proceedings provided for the determination of election contests are not actions under the technical definition of that term as\u00a0 furnished by the code itself.\u00a0 Certainly they\u00a0 are not ordinary suits in a court of justice.\u00a0 The statute providing for these contests expressly declares that the \"proceedings\" had thereunder shall not be\u00a0 \"upon pleadings or by action.\"\u00a0 And although this language is somewhat \"in-artificial,\" as pointed out by counsel for the respondents, it\u00a0 would seem to be\u00a0 sufficient,\u00a0 taken together with\u00a0 the general provisions of the statute, to make clear the intention of the legislator that these proceedings are not to be held to be\u00a0 \"actions\" in the strictly technical signification of that term as it is\u00a0 defined in the code, and are not necessarily\u00a0 subject to th\u00a7 incidents which by law attach to actions generally.\u00a0\u00a0 If proceedings for the determination of election contests are not actions under the code definition of that term,\u00a0 it follows of course that the express grant of authority to\u00a0 Courts of First\u00a0 Instance to grant\u00a0 new trials found in\u00a0 section\u00a0 145 of the code,\u00a0 being therein limited\u00a0 to\u00a0 judgments rendered\u00a0 in \"actions\"\u00a0 tried by those courts, does not extend to these proceedings.<br\/><br\/>But we\u00a0 prefer to rest our finding\u00a0 on this\u00a0 contention upon a broader foundation than that furnished by a technical examination\u00a0 of the language of the statute, believing as we\u00a0 do that the \"reason\u00a0 of\u00a0 the law\" which is \"the life of the law\" clearly forbids a finding that the legislator in enacting the law touching the determination of election protests intended to make or\u00a0 that\u00a0 he did in fact make the provisions of\u00a0 section\u00a0 145 of\u00a0 the code applicable thereto.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 remedy furnished for the trial of election contests, such as that under consideration, is one of the provisions of a general election law.\u00a0 Its peculiar and distinguishing features are manifestly the result of the\u00a0 demands of public policy that such contests should be instituted with the utmost promptitute, and\u00a0 dispatched and determined\u00a0 in the\u00a0 most summary manner consistent with the right\u00a0 of the various contestants to have an opportunity to be heard, and to submit evidence in support of their contentions; this in order \"to put a speedy and certain end to the litigation\u00a0 between the parties about a public matter so well calculated to promote and perpetuate discords and feuds\" - \"and destroy confidence on the local magistracy and demolish their efficiency.\" To this\u00a0 end,\u00a0 the\u00a0 statute confers exclusive and\u00a0 final jurisdiction over these election contests upon the Court of First Instance of the province wherein the contested election was held; and maps\u00a0 out\u00a0 a system of procedure, radically different from that\u00a0 prescribed in ordinary actions, and complete in outline from the \"institution\" to the \"determination\" thereof,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the\u00a0 execution\u00a0 of the judgment whereby the contests\u00a0 is\u00a0 \"determined;\" a system,\u00a0 which in our opinion, does\u00a0 not contemplate and by necessary implication\u00a0 denies the right of the trial court\u00a0 to review its judgment and to grant a\u00a0 new trial or\u00a0 enter a new judgment.<br\/><br\/>Examining the statute (sec. 27\u00a0 of Act No.\u00a0 1582), as above set out, we\u00a0 find that it furnishes a complete skeleton of the proceedings in an election contest from beginning to end,\u00a0 clearly,\u00a0 unmistakably, and\u00a0 unequivocally\u00a0 indicating where, how, and when such contests may be instituted, and with no less certainty, the mode and the time of their determination.\u00a0\u00a0 All the essential steps in the proceedings from the beginning to\u00a0 the end are\u00a0 given in\u00a0 outline,\u00a0 and while it is true, as ably expounded in respondents' brief, that in acting under\u00a0 and by virtue of the\u00a0 statute, the\u00a0 court\u00a0 will find itself compelled to fill out this skeleton outline by resorting to the\u00a0 various provisions\u00a0 of the Organic Law,\u00a0 under which it operates and has\u00a0 its being and\u00a0 to\u00a0 the General Procedural Law which in the absence of express\u00a0 or implied statutory provisions to the contrary controls all proceedings had in the Courts of First Instance\u00a0 of these Islands (sec. 795 of the Code of Civil Procedure); nevertheless, in the application\u00a0 of such general\u00a0 provisions, the court is necessarily controlled\u00a0 by the\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 of the special statute under which it is proceeding, and no incident of an ordinary action or special proceeding, which\u00a0 is in conflict with the express provisions of the special\u00a0 statute can be imported into it, nor can any such incident be deemed to constitute a part of the\u00a0 special\u00a0 proceeding furnished by the Act if it is\u00a0 not clearly within\u00a0 the limits and boundaries of\u00a0 such proceedings as expressly set out in the\u00a0 skeleton outline furnished by the statute, or\u00a0 if it is in manifest conflict with the spirit and intent of the\u00a0 legislator in authorizing such proceedings.<br\/><br\/>Examining more particularly the provisions of the statute touching the determination of election contests, we find that it clearly contemplates the bringing of all the\u00a0 proceedings on the merits of all such contests to an end promptly upon the determination of the contest\u00a0 by the court.\u00a0 If, as a result of the contest, no one of the candidates\u00a0 appears to have been duly elected, the court shall forthwith so certify to the Governor-General, who shall order a special election to fill the office or offices in question; if as a result\u00a0 of the contest, the court is of opinion that the canvass of the board of\u00a0 canvassers\u00a0 was incorrect,\u00a0 it clearly\u00a0 becomes the duty of the court, without waiting the end of the term, to issue its mandamus directing the\u00a0 correction of the canvass; and on the other hand, if it appears that the canvass was correct, it is as clearly the duty to decline to issue the mandamus; and in all cases the imperative duty is thereupon imposed upon the clerk of the court to give immediate notice\u00a0 of the determination of the\u00a0 contest to the\u00a0 Executive\u00a0 Secretary. All this, manifestly, in order that the Executive Department of the Government may thereupon take such further steps as may be proper and necessary in giving to the election its proper effect, or for\u00a0 the holding of a new election, in the event that the court is of opinion that no\u00a0 person was in fact elected.\u00a0 We think that there can\u00a0 be no doubt these express provisions for what may be described as the immediate execution of the \"determination\" of the contest by the court without giving any discretion to the court to stay the execution of its judgment, authorizing and directing the executive officers of the Government to proceed thereafter as if there were no contest pending, clearly, unmistakably, and unequivocally indicates the\u00a0 purpose\u00a0 of\u00a0 the legislator to bring these\u00a0 election contests to an end by the entry of the judgment of the court,\u00a0 without leaving it in the discretion of the court to reopen the contest thereafter.<br\/><br\/>This line of reasoning might be extended further, but we deem\u00a0 it unnecessary, and think that what has\u00a0 been said justifies us in holding\u00a0 in\u00a0 favor of petitioner's contention that Courts of First Instance have no jurisdiction to vacate final\u00a0 judgments entered\u00a0 by them \"determining\" election contests had\u00a0 under the provisions\u00a0 of section\u00a0 27 of Act No.\u00a0 1582.<br\/><br\/>Although this decision is rendered on\u00a0 respondents' demurrer to the petition,\u00a0 it entitles the petitioner to\u00a0 judgment in accordance with the prayer of his\u00a0 complaint, unless respondents raise some new and additional\u00a0 issues in their answer, which, with the whole record before us, we\u00a0 do not anticipate.\u00a0 Therefore,\u00a0 unless an answer\u00a0 to the\u00a0 complaint is filed within ten days\u00a0 from the date hereof, let judgment be entered declaring the vacating order in the election contest\u00a0 proceedings in the court below, dated June 29, 1910, and\u00a0 all further proceedings based thereon, null and void and of no effect as in excess of the jurisdiction of the court, without special condemnation of costs in this instance, and twenty days thereafter\u00a0 let the record in these\u00a0 proceedings be filed in the archive of original\u00a0 actions in this court.

Isidro Paredes presiding, convicting Dumacog, Pala, and Cawi of the crime\u00a0 of murder, the two\u00a0 former as principals and the latter as accomplice, and sentencing the principals to death and the accomplice to eighteen years eight months and twenty-one days of <i>cadena\u00a0 temporal.<\/i><br\/><br\/>On or about the 27th\u00a0 day\u00a0 of March, 1909, the authorities of the\u00a0 above-named sub-province\u00a0 were notified of the disappearance of an Igorot called\u00a0 Pagsangao, a resident of the <i>rancheria<\/i> of Tucucan, from the place where he was working as\u00a0 a Government employee in the town of Bontoc.\u00a0 The provincial authorities and the Constabulary of Bontoc at once instituted a search for the missing man, and, as a result of\u00a0 their efficient efforts, they not only found the body of the missing Igorot but also laid hands upon the persons who had been instrumental in his\u00a0 disappearance.\u00a0 The\u00a0 head of Pagsangao was first found; and later the headless body was discovered\u00a0 at\u00a0 an out-of-the-way\u00a0 place\u00a0 about\u00a0 two\u00a0 hours' walk from the town of Bontoc.\u00a0 While the head and body were in a condition considerably decayed, they were easily recognized as those of the missing Igorot by his relatives and friends, and especially by his brother, Saquian.<br\/><br\/>The body, aside\u00a0 from the wound made\u00a0 by severing the head from the\u00a0 trunk, disclosed two wounds, one on\u00a0 the left side just below the\u00a0 armpit, and the other on the shoulder blade, made from the rear.\u00a0 The hair of the head appeared to have been scorched and burned.<br\/><br\/>Two different versions were given as to how the deceased Igorot met his\u00a0 death.\u00a0 One was that offered by the accused Dumacog, who testified as a witness in his own behalf and in behalf of the accused Pala\u00a0 and Cawi.\u00a0 The other was that presented by the accused Puki, who, after the action\u00a0 against him had been dismissed in order that he might be used\u00a0 as a Government witness, gave what he asserted to be a complete and accurate history of the affair.<br\/><br\/>Dumacog, in his testimony, assumed by far\u00a0 the greater part of\u00a0 the\u00a0 responsibility for the death of Pagsangao.\u00a0 He included, however,\u00a0 in his history of the case, as an equal participant\u00a0 in\u00a0 the actual killing, the Government witness Puki, and fully acquitted of all responsibility the accused Pala. Dumacog testified in effect that on or about the 18th day of March, 1909, he heard that a brother of his had been killed by the deceased Pagsangao, who had cut off his head after first treacherously wounding and disabling him; that, on hearing of the murder of his brother, he decided to be avenged against his murderer by dealing with him as he had dealt with his brother; that, in pursuance of this scheme of vengeance, he, in company wih\u00a0 Puki, on the afternoon of the 21st of March, 1909, went to a place on the banks of the river Samuqui, about one-half\u00a0 mile from the plaza of the town of Bontoc; that while there they saw the deceased walking along the trail,\u00a0 returning from his day's work for the Government; that when he saw Pagsangao his anger flamed up and his desire for revenge was suddenly increased to such an\u00a0 extent that it overpowered\u00a0 him and, inducing Puki to join him, they made an attack upon the deceased, inflicting upon him various wounds with their aliwas; that after he was disabled they cut off his head;\u00a0 that they then called the accused Pala to show him the body and to take his advice as to the manner of disposing of it; that Pala went with them to look at the body and, upon seeing\u00a0 it, said to them, \"You\u00a0 be careful.\"<br\/><br\/>Testifying for the Government, Puki stated that,\u00a0 on the afternoon of the 21st day of March, 1909, he was in his house in the <i>rancheria<\/i> of Bontoc, when the three accused, Dumacog, Pala, and Cawi, all armed\u00a0 with aliwas,\u00a0 together came to his house and invited him to\u00a0 go with them to a specified place, saying that they were there going to lie in wait for and kill a certain man from Tucucan; that, accepting their invitation, he armed himself with his uliwa and went forth with them; that, arriving at the river Samuqui, which is a very narrow\u00a0 stream, they divided themselves\u00a0 into two parties, Pala and Dumacog taking a position on the bank of the river\u00a0 next to the\u00a0 road, while\u00a0 Puki\u00a0 and Cawi crossed the stream and took a position on the other bank; that they took said\u00a0 positions about the time that\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased Pagsangao would be traveling that\u00a0 way, going home from his work; that they had been stationed thus but a. few minutes when\u00a0 the deceased was seen approaching; that\u00a0 Pala and Dumacog remained concealed and allowed him to pass them without disclosing their whereabouts; that just after he had passed they arose stealthily and running quickly up behind\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 him attacked him with their aliwas, wounding him so badly that he fell to the ground almost lifeless; that Pala then cut his head from his body with two blows of his <i>aliwa;<\/i>\u00a0 that immediately after the killing Puki and Cawi joined\u00a0 their companions;\u00a0 that Pala took the\u00a0 head\u00a0 of Pagsangao and delivered it to Dumacog, who carried it to his own house and burned it; that the four together buried the body near the place\u00a0 where the killing occurred.<br\/><br\/>Concerning the conflicting stories of Dumacog and Puki, the learned trial court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"If the\u00a0 court in taking into consideration these two\u00a0 versions\u00a0 of the killing of Pagsangao believes the testimony of Dumacog\u00a0 to be true then it would be compelled to convict him and also Puki, if the case against\u00a0 Puki had not been dismissed.\u00a0 But on the other hand if the court believes the testimony of Puki as against\u00a0 the testimony of\u00a0 Dumacog then there would be nothing left for the court to do except to convict Pala as well as Dumacog and Cawi.<br\/><br\/>\"After the court has duly and carefully considered and examined\u00a0 the proofs adduced\u00a0 at the trial of this case it comes to the conclusion not to accept the testimony of Dumacog in so far as it relates to the\u00a0 two accused, Pala and C\u00a3wi, but to accept it in so far as\u00a0 it relates to his own participation in the crime.\u00a0 His testimony appears to be very suspicious\u00a0 and\u00a0 it may be said was inspired by his codefendant Pala,\u00a0 who while\u00a0 they were\u00a0 in jail together proposed to Dumacog that if he would testify in such a manner as would exempt him, Pala, from all responsibility\u00a0 he\u00a0 would recompense him by taking care of his (Dumacog's) family by giving them food\u00a0 and attending to their\u00a0 rice fields.\u00a0\u00a0 Not only for the\u00a0 reasons above expressed does his testimony appear to be very suspicious but also from the fact that Pala not only exerts a great influence over Dumacog but also over the entire <i>rancheria <\/i>of Bontoc.\u00a0 It appears from the\u00a0 testimony adduced at this trial that because of the reputation of Pala as a\u00a0 fighting man he is not only feared in Bontoc but in all the surrounding <i>rancherias<\/i>, and because of his character he is one of the principal chiefs and wields\u00a0 more influence\u00a0 over the Igorots of\u00a0 Bontoe than\u00a0 any other one chief.\u00a0\u00a0 But the most fatal defect which appears in Dumacog's testimony is\u00a0 that he has made several contradictory statements under oath in regard to this crime.\u00a0 When he first testified before the lieutenant-governor of Bontoe acting as <i>ex officio <\/i>justice\u00a0 of the\u00a0 peace, he then did hot assume all the responsibility for the crime but also implicated Pala, his coaccused in\u00a0 this case.\u00a0 He at that time did not make any\u00a0 attempt to save Pala, his chief, from all responsibility by swearing falsely, as he has on this trial, and it was not until after he had been placed in prison with Pala that he changed his attitude toward Pala and began tpymake contradictory statements in regard to this crime. When a witness makes two statements, both being sworn to as a witness in one case, and these statements incur in the gravest contradictions then the court can not accept either\u00a0 the\u00a0 first or second statements as proof.\u00a0 He himself by his\u00a0 own act of giving\u00a0 false\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 impeaches his\u00a0 own testimony and the court is compelled to exclude it from all consideration.\u00a0 On the other hand the testimony of Puki is much more acceptable\u00a0 and credible and also much more\u00a0 reasonable; it being the testimony\u00a0 of a disinterested witness, and\u00a0 it further being corroborated\u00a0 by certain facts which will be set forth later on in this decision.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Referring to certain contradictions into which it is alleged the witness Puki fell, the learned trial\u00a0 court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is riot important as having any bearing\u00a0 on\u00a0 the case at bar the fact that Puki testified that Auiden was present at the jail here in Bontoe when Pala made the proposition to Pumacog that if he, Dumacog, would testify in such a manner as to shift all responsibility from him (Pala) to Dumacog he (Pala) would look out for the family of Dumacog and that he would provide for the caring of Dumacog's rice fields and that in his testimony before this court Auiden did not fully sustain the testimony\u00a0 of Puki in\u00a0 regard\u00a0 to\u00a0 the said proposition made by Pala to Dumacog, because he did not in any manner contradict the testimony of Puki upon this particular point, but simply said that he, Auiden, was walking: up and down in front of the jail at the time Puki testified that Pala was engaged in making his said proposition to Dumacog, and it is reasonable to believe that it is possible that Auiden did not really hear the conversation.\u00a0 Auiden was present at the jail, as Puki testified, because he was in charge of the prisoners at the time Pala made his alleged proposition to Dumacog, but because of the fact of the walking of his post it is possible that he did not hear the alleged proposition.\u00a0 It is also natural and\u00a0 reasonable for Puki to have thought that Auiden did hear the proposition of Pala and\u00a0 his conversation with Puki and Dumacog on this point. Neither was the testimony of Puki\u00a0 contradicted in regard to the\u00a0 place where the murder of Pagsangao was committed not having large stones or trees.\u00a0 Puki states that the place was devoid of large stones and large trees, that is, the place along\u00a0 which the deceased Pagsangao passed on\u00a0 that fatal afternoon, but he testified in his\u00a0 direct examination, that they hid themselves behind stones from Pagaangao's view and\u00a0 there awaited his arrival and\u00a0 that when he\u00a0 arrived there Pala\u00a0 and Dumacog pursued him and attacked him. In answer\u00a0 to the\u00a0 questions\u00a0 of the defense on his cross-examination he testified that there were\u00a0 no large stones or large trees there where they might hide themselves, but that there were\u00a0 sufficient depressions and stones which offered them sufficient cover whereby they might keep, their persons from being seen from the road.\u00a0\u00a0 This part of Puki's testimony does not affect to any great extent the main question at issue in this case.\u00a0 The fact is that in the place or sitio where\u00a0 the crime was committed these four people,\u00a0 Pala, Dumacog, Cawi, and Puki were there in hiding and\u00a0 waiting for the deceased to pass along so that they might surprise their intended victim\u00a0 at the psychological moment\u00a0 without placing their\u00a0 own\u00a0 persons\u00a0 at any\u00a0 risk.\u00a0 This is\u00a0 exactly what. Puki meant\u00a0 when he said that they\u00a0 went there and divided themselves\u00a0 into two groups of two persons to each group in order that they might cut off any retreat or escape of their victim and enemy.\u00a0 And besides there occur many other\u00a0 contradictions\u00a0 in the testimony\u00a0 of Dumacog which make\u00a0 his entire testimony utterly incredible.\"<\/blockquote>Summing up the case in favor of tne credibility of\u00a0 the witness, Puki, the learned court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The following facts corroborate and establish\u00a0 the\u00a0 veracity of Puki's testimony:<br\/><br\/>\"First.\u00a0 Puki confessed always to his\u00a0 participation in\u00a0 the crime\u00a0 in almost the\u00a0 same terms each time,\u00a0 or that is, as nearly in the same terms and words as a man of his education and intelligence might be expected to do, and also as to\u00a0 the participation of each\u00a0 of the other accused.<br\/><br\/>\"Second. Puki, himself, was the person who indicated to the authorities the place where the remains\u00a0 of Pagsangao were interred, and it\u00a0 was Puki who indicated to Lieutenant Nicolas of the Constabulary and others, that the head of Pagsangao was buried in the house of Dumacog, and there is where the head in fact was discovered.<br\/><br\/>\"Third. The details set forth in his testimony in regard to the wounds which\u00a0 were inflicted upon the body of Pagsangao and their number and location\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the body was clearly and fully corroborated by other witnesses and by\u00a0 the accused Dumacog.\u00a0 Puki said that besides the decapitation of the head, Pagsangao's body had two other\u00a0 wounds on it, and it appears that the wounds described by him were in the exact location on the body as the locations described in his testimony; and not only these facts but also the manner in which Puki testified before this court more thoroughly convinces the court of the veracity of his testimony.\u00a0\u00a0 He testified in a straightforward manner without incurring in any grave contradictions or confusion,\u00a0 and he had the heroism to testify\u00a0 face to face to\u00a0 his\u00a0 coaccused and especially did he face the mighty Pala who was able to hold in abject fear the people of the rancheriy of Bontoc and its surrounding rancherias.\u00a0 This mighty influence of the accused Pala was impressed upon the mind of the court during the two times that Puki was called to testify, and especially during the examination of the witness Caslangan who at first utterly refused, in open court, to take the oath administered by the clerk of the court because as he stated for fear not only of the accused Pala and his coaccused but also of all the people of the <i>rancheria<\/i> of Bontoc, and, especially of the family of Pala.<br\/><br\/>\"The facts as testified to by\u00a0 Puki\u00a0 which are sufficiently corroborated by other witnesses, and which are accepted by the court\u00a0 as the true facts in the case at bar, establish and constitute the crime of <i>asesinato<\/i> as charged in the complaint, in which\u00a0 there are present the\u00a0 attendant circumstances\u00a0 of treachery which\u00a0 is clearly established by the fact proved that the aggressors of Pagsangao attacked\u00a0 him from the rear without any risk whatsoever to their own persons.\"<\/blockquote>We have read the evidence adduced\u00a0 in this case with great care and given it most thorough consideration.\u00a0 The learned trial court in the opinion which\u00a0 forms the basis of his judgment\u00a0 presented the\u00a0 facts with great clearness and thoroughness.\u00a0 We have been unable to discover in his discussion of the facts\u00a0 anything which warrants criticism or requires any comment other than favorable. Through the maze\u00a0 of contradictions he threaded his way with perspicacity and arrived at a conclusion which\u00a0 we deem eminently fair and sound.\u00a0 We find it necessary to make only one modification of the judgment before us. The\u00a0 learned trial court found that the aggravating circumstances of <i>alevosia<\/i> and\u00a0 <i>en cuadrilla<\/i> were present in\u00a0 the commission of the crime, which crime was qualified by\u00a0 deliberate\u00a0 premeditation, and sentenced Dumacog and Pala to death and\u00a0 Cawi to eighteen years eight months and twenty-one\u00a0 day of <i>cadena temporal. <\/i>\u00a0 We are of the opinion that article 11 of the Penal Code ought to have\u00a0 been invoked in favor of the accused.\u00a0\u00a0 These accused were all members of a savage tribe, densely ignorant and deeply superstitious.\u00a0 They are creatures of custom and tradition.\u00a0 The act of taking the head of Pagsangao appealed to them\u00a0 not only as a right but as a duty which they\u00a0 owed\u00a0 to the deceased\u00a0 brother of Dumacog.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 judgment of the court below\u00a0 is\u00a0 modified and\u00a0 the accused Dumacog and\u00a0 Pala are each\u00a0 sentenced to <i>cadena perpetua.\u00a0 <\/i> The accused Cawi is sentenced\u00a0 to twelve years and one day of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cadena temporal<\/span>\u00a0\u00a0 The said three accused are\u00a0 hereby sentenced and required to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Pagsangao in the sum of P500, and to pay three-fourths of the cost of\u00a0 the trial below.<br\/><br\/>As so\u00a0 modified,\u00a0 the judgment is affirmed,\u00a0 with\u00a0 costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

While out with the working party he was much\u00a0 excited, and\u00a0 evidently full of resentment against the deceased because of the bad treatment to which he had been subjected; and\u00a0 just\u00a0 before leaving, he\u00a0 jumped up and declared that he was the only brave man in the company, and reproached his companions for their\u00a0 cowardice in submitting to the tyranny and abuse of the deceased.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon returning to the cuartel he took his rifle from its place on the wall of the room where it was\u00a0 kept, loaded\u00a0 it, went to another room where the deceased\u00a0 was sitting down engaged in\u00a0 putting on his puttees, and without warning shot him through the body, and again discharged his piece against the\u00a0 deceased, who\u00a0 had fallen to the floor, as a result of\u00a0 the wound inflicted by the first shot.\u00a0 The death of his victim followed almost instantaneously.\u00a0\u00a0 Again loading his piece the\u00a0 defendant held his comrades at bay for a short time,\u00a0 declaring that\u00a0 he was\u00a0 \"the\u00a0 king of the <i>cuartel<\/i>,\" but promptly surrendered the rifle to one of his officers who came up a few moments later.\u00a0 The shooting took\u00a0 place between 7.15 and 7.20 a. m.<br\/><br\/>These facts,\u00a0 which are\u00a0 conclusively established\u00a0 by the evidence of record, leave no room for doubt\u00a0 as to the guilt of the accused of the crime of assassination, in that he unlawfully took the life of the deceased with treachery (<i>con alevosia<\/i>), the suddenness of the attack with a rifle depriving the deceased of\u00a0 all opportunity to\u00a0 defend\u00a0 himself,\u00a0 and making it possible for the defendant to take the life of his victim without any risk to his own person.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 10, Penal Code.)<br\/><br\/>We do\u00a0 not think, however, that the facts proven sustain a finding of deliberate premeditation (p<i>remeditacion conocida<\/i>) in the commission\u00a0 of the crime.\u00a0 The resolution to take the life of the deceased is not\u00a0 shown to have entered into the mind of the accused before the moment when he left the working party, and, indeed, it may be doubted whether the evidence as to his boasts and reproaches directed to his companions upon that occasion,\u00a0 taken together with his subsequent conduct, is sufficient evidence to sustain a finding that even at that time his mind was made up to take the life of the man who had insulted and maltreated him.\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence discloses that he\u00a0 left the working party some little time after it reached the\u00a0 place where the work was being done\u00a0 at a considerable distance from the cuartel.\u00a0\u00a0 At that time,\u00a0 therefore, it must have been getting well on toward 7 o'clock.\u00a0 All the witnesses agree that the shooting\u00a0 took place\u00a0 between 7.15 and 7.20 that morning.\u00a0 It thus appears that from the earliest moment at which there is any evidence which even tends to disclose the resolution of the defendant to commit the\u00a0 crime, until the moment of its commission there could not have elapsed a period of\u00a0 much\u00a0 more than twenty-five to thirty minutes;\u00a0 and a considerable\u00a0 part\u00a0 of that time must have been occupied\u00a0 in returning from his work\u00a0 to the cuartel, finding his rifle, loading it and going to the place where he found his victim.\u00a0 The mere lapse of such a period of time, under the circumstances of this case, is not sufficient to establish the existence of that form of deliberate premeditation which constitutes the qualifying aggravating circumstance which under the\u00a0 law raises the crime of homicide to that of assassination.\u00a0\u00a0 This court in the case of the\u00a0 U. S. vs. Gil (13 Phil. Rep., 531) laid down the doctrine as to deliberate premeditation as follows, quoting the language of the syllabus:<br\/><blockquote>\"The period\u00a0 of\u00a0 time necessary\u00a0 to justify the inference of deliberate premeditation is a period sufficient in a judicial sense to afford full opportunity for meditation\u00a0 and\u00a0 reflection, and sufficient to allow the conscience of the actor to overcome the resolution of his will if he desires\u00a0 to hearken to its warnings.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Our attention has\u00a0 been called to the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Beecham (15 Phil. Rep., 272), wherein\u00a0 we held, upon\u00a0 a finding\u00a0 of\u00a0 facts in many respects\u00a0 very\u00a0 similar to those in the case at bar, that the crime was committed with deliberate premeditation.\u00a0 That case,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 is clearly distinguishable from\u00a0 the case at bar, in that the\u00a0 court held that\u00a0 the evidence therein\u00a0 submitted disclosed\u00a0 that the defendant in that\u00a0 case\u00a0 had formed the resolution to\u00a0 take the life of his victim many days\u00a0 prior to the date of the commission of the crime, and that the commission\u00a0 of the crime substantially\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 manner and\u00a0 form\u00a0 in\u00a0 which it was committed was\u00a0 definitely\u00a0 resolved\u00a0 upon\u00a0 at least\u00a0 four\u00a0 or five hours before the\u00a0 shooting took place.\u00a0 In\u00a0 this case, as we have shown,\u00a0 there is nothing whatever upon which to base\u00a0 a finding that the resolution\u00a0 to take\u00a0 the life of the deceased was formed\u00a0 more than half an hour before the act was committed, and it may perhaps be doubted whether the evidence conclusively establishes that the intention to kill was\u00a0 actually\u00a0 formulated prior to\u00a0 the\u00a0 moment\u00a0 when\u00a0 the defendant returned to the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cuartel<\/span> and loaded his rifle.<br\/><br\/>The commission of the crime of assassination of which the defendant was proven guilty not being marked with either aggravating or extenuating circumstances the penalty prescribed therefor should have\u00a0 been\u00a0 imposed in\u00a0 its\u00a0 medium degree.\u00a0 We therefore reverse the\u00a0 judgment of conviction and sentence of\u00a0 death imposed by the trial court and find the defendant guilty of the crime of assassination\u00a0 without aggravating or extenuating circumstances and impose upon the defendant the penalty of <i>cadena perpetua<\/i>, together with the accessory penalties\u00a0 prescribed by law, the indemnification of the heirs of Pedro Coimpio, the deceased, in the sum of P1,000, and the payment of the\u00a0 costs\u00a0 in both instances.

No opposition\u00a0 was presented.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence, the Hon. J. A. Ostrand, found that the plaintiffs\u00a0 were entitled to have the said parcels of land registered and so ordered and decreed.<br\/><br\/>On the same day (the 15th of March, 1910)\u00a0 and\u00a0 after the above hearing and decree, the <i>presidente <\/i>of the municipality of Cabiao appeared and presented his\u00a0 opposition to the registration of the said\u00a0 first\u00a0 parcel of land,\u00a0 alleging that the said parcel (the first)\u00a0 belonged to the municipality\u00a0 of Cabiao, and asked that the order decreeing the registration of the said first parcel be vacated and that, a new trial\u00a0 be ordered.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the opposition of the said <i>presidente,<\/i> Judge Ostrand on the 22d day of March, 1910, ordered a\u00a0 new trial which took place on the 25th day of April, 1910.<br\/><br\/>On the 26th day of April, 1910, Ignacio\u00a0 Villamor, Attorney-General for the\u00a0 Philippine\u00a0 Islands,\u00a0 presented an opposition on the partkof the Insular Government against the registration of the first parcel of land mentioned in the petition of the petitioners, upon the ground that the said parcel of\u00a0 land belonged to the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>On the 6th day of May, 1910, after hearing the\u00a0 evidence of the petitioners and oppositors, Judge Ostrand\u00a0 rendered the following decree:<br\/><blockquote>\"It appears from the evidence that the land sought to be registered, is an<i> estero,<\/i> the water from which is utilized by the petitioners, together with other persons, for the irrigation of the lands bordering on\u00a0 the said\u00a0 estero, and that, therefore, the petitioners have neither\u00a0 the ownership nor the exclusive\u00a0 possession of the said\u00a0 estero, but, at the most,\u00a0 solely the right to the\u00a0 use of a part of the water therefrom, for the irrigation of their lands.\u00a0 In the opinion of the court, such a right, in itself alone, is not registerable under .the Land Registration Act.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From this decree the petitioners appealed and made the following assignments of\u00a0 error:<br\/><blockquote>\"II. The court erred in finding in his judgment that the petitioners did not have the\u00a0 ownership, or\u00a0 the\u00a0 absolute possession, of\u00a0 the first tract sought to\u00a0 be registered, that is, of the tract known by the name of 'Pinaglamuan.'<br\/><br\/>\"III. The court erred\u00a0 in finding, in\u00a0 the judgment, that the petitioners are entitled to use only a part\u00a0 of the water from the\u00a0 'Pinaglamuan' tract.<br\/><br\/>\"IV. The court erred in not decreeing in his judgment that the second tract specified in the application be\u00a0 registered in the property registry in the name of the petitioners.<br\/><br\/>\"V.\u00a0 And, lastly, the court erred in rendering judgment upon the matter of this appeal, by not having given proper weight therein to the evidence presented and taken during the hearing on the application.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Reading the\u00a0 judgment or decree of the lower court above quoted, it is\u00a0 not clear whether or not\u00a0 it\u00a0 was intended to deny the\u00a0 registration\u00a0 of\u00a0 both parcels of land.\u00a0 Judge Ostrand said: \"Resulta de las pruebas que los terrenos cuya inscripcidn se pretende, es un estero,\"\u00a0 As far as the record shows\u00a0 the two parcels of land are in\u00a0 no way connected. There was no opposition\u00a0 presented by any one relating to the registration of the second parcel of land and\u00a0 there was no proof\u00a0 adduced during the second trial relating to\u00a0 the rights\u00a0 of\u00a0 either the plaintiffs or defendants to the said second\u00a0 parcel of land.<br\/><br\/>Upon an examination\u00a0 of the record, we find nothing that justifies the denial of the registration of the second parcel of land\u00a0 in favor\u00a0 of\u00a0 the petitioners.\u00a0 The registration of the second\u00a0 parcel\u00a0 of\u00a0 land is, therefore, hereby\u00a0 admitted and directed.\u00a0\u00a0 If it was intended by the decree of the lower court to deny the registration of the second parcel of land in favor of the plaintiffs, that part of said decree is hereby revoked and it is\u00a0 hereby directed that a\u00a0 decree be entered directing the registration of the said second parcel of land in favor of the petitioners.<br\/><br\/>With reference\u00a0 to the first parcel of land, the evidence, in our\u00a0 judgment,\u00a0 clearly shows that the\u00a0 plaintiffs are not entitled to the\u00a0 registration of the same under the Torrens system.\u00a0 The evidence shows that the municipality of Cabiao had\u00a0 for many\u00a0 years, controlled the right\u00a0 of\u00a0 fishing upon the\u00a0 said parcel of\u00a0 land, the\u00a0 same being variously called an\u00a0 <i>estero<\/i> or\u00a0 <i>laguna.<\/i>\u00a0 The evidence also discloses that other persons had made use of the <i>estero<\/i> for various purposes, such as draining their land or using\u00a0 the water from said\u00a0 <i>estero<\/i> during the dry season for the irrigation of their land.\u00a0 Upon the whole, the evidence shows clearly that the plaintiffs are not the sole\u00a0 and\u00a0 exclusive owners of the said first parcel of land.<br\/><br\/>We expressly waive\u00a0 a\u00a0 discussion of\u00a0 the\u00a0 right\u00a0 of the alleged\u00a0 owners of land,\u00a0 such as that described in the first parcel,\u00a0 to\u00a0 have the same registered under the Torrens system.\u00a0\u00a0 It is sufficient for the present to deny the registration of\u00a0 said first parcel\u00a0 of land\u00a0 upon the ground that the plaintiffs are not\u00a0 the sole owners\u00a0 thereof.<br\/><br\/>Without\u00a0 a more\u00a0 detailed\u00a0 discussion\u00a0 of the respective assignments of error, we are of\u00a0 the opinion and so decide that the judgment of the lower court denying the registration of\u00a0 the first parcel\u00a0 of land\u00a0 should\u00a0 be and\u00a0 is hereby affirmed.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore let\u00a0 a judgment be entered directing - <br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>) That the judgment of the lower court denying the registration of\u00a0 the first\u00a0 parcel of .land be affirmed; and<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 Let a judgment be entered directing that the second parcel of land be\u00a0 registered in\u00a0 the name of the plaintiffs.

J. Milliron, an internal-revenue agent, testified that Vicente Base took to the governor of Cebu a can of opium containing 200 grammes of the said drug, in order to show him that the accused had sold opium to Base, and the governor called the witness in order that he might take part in this case. After the accused was arrested, he confessed before the witness and the provincial fiscal that he had sold to Vicente Base thirty cans of opium on the 15th of August, 1909, but that he had not received the price thereof, and that the money which was found in a box of his on board the British steamship <i>Erroll<\/i>, Pl,500 in amount, was obtained in Manila and was seized by the captain of the vessel. According to the accused, he had purchased in Hongkong 137 cans of opium for the purpose of introducing it as contraband into Mexico, the destination of the vessel, but that as the latter changed its route touching first at Manila, the opium arrived at Cebu.<br\/><br\/>Vicente Base testified that he had negotiated with the accused with respect to the sale of the three sacks of opium which were seized while in the latter's possession and were the subject matter of the previous cause; that these three sacks were not taken ashore, because the accused would not permit this to be done without previous delivery of the whole price of P1,000, of which witness had only paid P533; that he therefore only took one can from one of the said sacks.<br\/><br\/>The Court of First Instance of Cebu sentenced the accused to one year's imprisonment and the payment of a fine of P2,000, with additional subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, not to exceed one-third of the principal penalty, and to the payment of the costs of the trial. It was ordered in the judgment that the exhibits connected with the case should be confiscated, and that, in case of an appeal, and even after the sentence had been served, the defendant should not be released from custody, but delivered to the customs authorities for the purpose of the enforcement of the existing immigration laws.<br\/><br\/>The defendant appealed and has alleged before this court that he can not be punished in accordance with section 15 of Act No. 1761, under which the complaint was drawn. This said section 15 reads thus:<br\/><blockquote>\" (<i>a<\/i>) No person shall import, cook, or prepare opium, or engage in the business of purchasing or selling opium or of dealing or trafficking therein, unless he shall first have secured from the Collector of Internal Revenue a license to transact such business and shall have paid the license tax prescribed by this Act.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\"<\/blockquote>To make an isolated sale, says the appellant, is not to engage in the business of selling. To negotiate the sale of opium does not mean clandestinely to sell opium once.<br\/><br\/>In our opinion, the act defined in section 15 is distinct from that penalized in section 5; the act referred to in the latter is any act of sale, while that concerned in the former relates to the business of selling, in an habitual, professional manner, as one of an undertaking or occupation, without license.<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 5. <i>(a)<\/i> It shall be unlawful to sell, transfer, give, or deliver opium to any person except to a duly licensed and practicing physician, pharmacist, or second-class pharmacist, or a duly licensed dispensator of opium, or duly registered confirmed user of opium in a licensed opium dispensary for consumption therein only, and in accordance with the provisions of this Act:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\" (<i>b<\/i>) Any person violating the provisions of the preceding subsection shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand pesos, or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\"<\/blockquote>The crime concerned in this case, according to this section 5, is comprised within the language of the complaint which charges the act of selling opium without the authorization of the Collector of Internal Revenue.<br\/><br\/>The other ground of the appeal is that the confessions of the accused were taken into account for the purpose of his conviction. The trial court pronounced its sentence after considering that \"sufficient proof has been furnished by the evidence\/' and the evidence did not consist solely in the confession that the accused, on the day and at the place mentioned in the complaint, contracted with Vicente Base for the sale of the opium, the subject matter of the present prosecution; and as this finding does not appear to be erroneous nor contrary to the conclusions reached from the evidence, it is accepted by this court in order that thereby the judgment appealed from may be duly affirmed, as we do affirm the same.<br\/><br\/>This disposes of the appeal; but, in the opinion of this court, the defense of double jeopardy alleged by the accused in first instance, with exception to the order disallowing it, can not but be taken into consideration, although in the instance, on the appeal, that defense was not reproduced with the allegation that its disallowance was an error committed by the lower court in its judgment. This point appears to involve a question of jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>Before separating the two causes, as related at the beginning of this decision, there was but one single complaint and there would have been only one trial for the possession of opium and for the sale of opium. But the defendant's counsel Bet up a demurrer, arguing that the complaint was defective inasmuch as it charged two distinct crimes, for according to the defense, it was alleged to be one crime to possess opium and another different crime to sell opium; and the court deferred to this pretension and ordered the filing of two complaints, one for the possession of opium and another for the sale of opium; that for the possession of opium was the one first tried by the lower court.<br\/><br\/>In answering the second complaint for the sale of opium, the defendant alleged that he had already been in jeopardy.<br\/><blockquote>\"The defendant was convicted yesterday,\" said his attorney, \"for the violation of law committed, of possessing opium, and has already been sentenced by this court to five years' imprisonment and in addition to pay a fine of ten thousand pesos. According to the principles of penal law, when a crime has been committed which is necessary in order to commit another, the delinquent, of course, can not be punished for the two crimes, but must suffer for the crime for which the greater penalty was provided.\"<\/blockquote>The court rejected this allegation: first, because the prosecution of two crimes instead of one was brought about by the defense itself; and second, because, in the opinion of the trial judge, if the defendant had first been convicted for selling opium, he certainly would have been in jeopardy in the cause prosecuted for possessing opium, for the reason that really one can not sell opium without possessing it, while, if the terms are inverted, the same result does not follow, because one may possess opium without selling it, and consequently in the present cause the allegation of double jeopardy is inadmissible.<br\/><br\/>True it is, we assert, that it is one crime to possess opium, punished by section 31 of the Act, and another, to sell opium, penalized by section 5 of the same Act before cited.<br\/><br\/>And it is also true that when one single act constitutes two or more crimes, or when one of them is a necessary means for the commission of the other, only the penalty corresponding to the more serious crime shall be imposed, in its maximum degree, and thus, he who smokes opium in a pipe, by one single act lays himself liable to three penalties of the law, one of them, merely for the fact of possessing opium, another, for the mere possession of a pipe in which opium is smoked, and the other, for the act of smoking opium; but the penalties corresponding to these three crimes ought not to be imposed upon the defendant in this case, and only the penalty for the most serious of these crimes.<br\/><br\/>But the illegal possession of 137 cans of opium and the illegal sale of 30 cans of opium, which are the two acts confessed by the accused, are not one act which constitutes two crimes, nor a crime which is a necessary means for the commission of another. They are two isolated acts, punishable, each of them, in themselves. Only in the event where all the amount of the opium possessed and seized be in its totality the same as that which was possessed with the sole purpose of being delivered as the matter or subject of a sale previously agreed upon, could it be said, in the opinion of this court, that the possession of the opium was a necessary means to effect the delivery by reason of the sale, and that the sale agreed upon was the sole reason for the possession of the opium seized. The possession of the quantity contained in the pipe can not be considered as a different crime from that of smoking opium in a pipe, nor the possession of the pipe, as a crime different from that of smoking opium in a pipe. But if the person surprised in smoking opium in a pipe was also surprised in the possession of the thirty cans sold by the accused, it could not properly be inferred that the possession of these thirty cans, which in itself is a crime, was a necessary means for the commission of the other crime of smoking opium in a pipe, and that the person in whose possession the thirty cans were seized, possessed the same solely and exclusively for the purpose of smoking opium in a pipe.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It might very well have been that he had acquired the drug for the purpose of inhaling, injecting, chewing, swallowing, or other uses, and that only by chance did it occur to him to try to smoke it in a pipe, on the very occasion when he was surprised, this being the evident fact of the commission of the crime which can not, in its essence, include the existence of thirty cans, not then contained in the pipe, each can certainly being susceptible of other various uses, every one of which might by its nature constitute a different crime.<br\/><br\/>We consider this doctrine equally applicable to crimes which are evils by their very nature, as well as to those which are merely <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">malum quia prohibitum;<\/span> because it not only aims at a more or less strict application of a penal precept which, undoubtedly, in the practice of this court, usually tends toward the lesser severity and, occasionally, the greatest benignity when the second class, or conventional crimes, are concerned, but also because that doctrine is the logical result of the process of the intelligence in the derivation of consequences from the principles constitutive of the nature of things.<br\/><br\/>Thus it is that we find the institution of this cause, and its separation from the previous one, to be founded on law and juridical principles, and the judgment appealed from, to be in accordance with right and equity, except with regard to the amount of the penalty, which we reduce, in harmony with the provisions of section 5 aforementioned, to six months' imprisonment and a fine of P1,000 Philippine currency.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, with the understanding that the imprisonment and the fine imposed shall be, respectively, six months and P1,000 Philippine currency, we affirm, as to all the rest, the judgment appealed from, with the costs of this instance against the appellant. So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa<\/i>, and <i>Johnson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><i>Carson, J.<\/i>, concurs in the result.<br\/><\/div>",

That as the result of said marriage two children were born, one having died some years before the date\u00a0 of the trial of the present\u00a0 cause,\u00a0 and the other being the defendant herein.<\/p><p>Third. That when the defendant herein was a very small boy, his father (Santiago Yulong) took him to China, where they remained\u00a0 for a few years; the exact time does not appear of record.<\/p><p>Fourth, That when Santiago Yulong\u00a0 returned to the Philippine Islands, after his said visit to China, he brought with him his\u00a0 son, the defendant,\u00a0 some years\u00a0 before the American occupation of the Islands, and continued to live in the pueblo of Navotas, Province of Rizal,\u00a0 until his death, which occurred some years before the trial of the present cause.<\/p><p>Fifth. That the said Santiago Yulong and his wife, En- rica Santos, both\u00a0 died some considerable time before the trial of the present cause.\u00a0\u00a0 The date when the parents died does not appear of record.<\/p><p>Sixth.

That at the time the defendant was arrested he was\u00a0 a cook in the home of his cousin.<\/p><p>Eighth.\u00a0 That at the time of\u00a0 the trial, the defendant was seventeen (17) years of age.<\/p><p>The record does not disclose what business\u00a0 or\u00a0 occupation\u00a0 the father of the defendant had.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which shows that the father of the defendant did not have\u00a0 a right to reside and to continue to reside in the Philippine Islands at the time of his death.<\/p><p>The question\u00a0 presented\u00a0 is, under\u00a0 all of the facts disclosed by the record, has the defendant a right to continue to reside\u00a0 in\u00a0 the Philippine Islands, notwithstanding\u00a0 the fact\u00a0 that\u00a0 he\u00a0 does not have the certificate required under Act\u00a0 No. 702\u00a0 of the Philippine\u00a0 Commission?<\/p><p>Said Act No. 702 is an Act\u00a0 to regulate\u00a0 the registration of Chinese persons in the Philippine Islands and to carry into\u00a0 effect and enforce the provisions of\u00a0 section 4 of an Act of Congress approved April 29, 1902, entitled \"An Act to prohibit the coming into and to regulate the residence within the United\u00a0 States,\u00a0 its territories and all territory under its jurisdiction and the District of Columbia, of Chinese persons\u00a0 and persons of Chinese descent.\"<\/p><p>It\u00a0 will\u00a0 be\u00a0 remembered that the defendant\u00a0 is a minor child; that his parents resided in the Philippine\u00a0 Islands at the time of their death and, so far as the record shows, had a perfect right to continue to remain therein.<\/p><p>There\u00a0 has\u00a0 been\u00a0 some difference of opinion among\u00a0 the judges of the Federal, district, and\u00a0 circuit courts of\u00a0 the United States upon the question whether the minor child, of a\u00a0 Chinese\u00a0 person who has a\u00a0 right to remain in territory of the United\u00a0 States, can\u00a0 enter territory of the\u00a0 United States without the certificate provided for by law.<\/p><p>The judges in\u00a0 some cases have held that\u00a0 the wife and minor child are entitled to come into\u00a0 the country with him (the father)\u00a0 or after him\u00a0 (the father) without the certificate prescribed.\u00a0\u00a0 See <em>In re<\/em> Chung Toy Ho (42 Fed.

S.<em> vs<\/em>.\u00a0 Gue Lim\u00a0 (176 U.\u00a0 S., 459) (1900), in\u00a0 a\u00a0 carefully decided opinion has held that the wife and minor children of a Chinese person who has a right to remain in territory of the United States, have a right to enter the United States without the certificate required by\u00a0 law.\u00a0\u00a0 In discussing the question involved in that case, Mr. Justice Peckham, speaking for the court, said:<\/p><p><\/p><blockquote>\"To hold that a certificate is required in this case is\u00a0 to decide that the woman can not come into the country at all, for it is not possible for her to comply with the act, because she can not\u00a0 in any event\u00a0 procure\u00a0 the certificate even by returning to\u00a0 China.\u00a0\u00a0 She must come in as the wife of her domiciled husband or not at all. The act was never meant to accomplish the result permanently excluding the wife under the circumstances of this case, and we think that, properly and\u00a0 reasonably construed, it does not do so.\u00a0 If we hold that she is entitled to come in as the wife, because the true construction of the treaty and the act permits it, there is no provision which makes the certificate the\u00a0 only proof of the fact that she is such wife.\u00a0 <p><\/p><p>\"In the case of the minor children, the same result must follow as in that of the wife.\u00a0 All the reasons which favor the construction of the statute as exempting the wife from the necessity of procuring\u00a0 a\u00a0 certificate\u00a0 apply with equal force to the case of minor children of a member or members of the admitted classes.\u00a0\u00a0 They come in by reason of their relationship to the father, and whether they accompany or follow him, a\u00a0 certificate\u00a0 is not necessary in either case. When\u00a0 the\u00a0 fact is\u00a0 established to\u00a0 the satisfaction of\u00a0 the authorities that the person\u00a0 claiming to enter,\u00a0 either\u00a0 as wife or minor\u00a0 child, is in fact the wife or minor child of one of the\u00a0 members of a\u00a0 class mentioned in the treaty as entitled to\u00a0 enter, then\u00a0 that person is entitled to admission without the certificate.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>That decision settles\u00a0 the question that children of Chinese persons, who have a right to remain in the territory of\u00a0 the United States, may enter\u00a0 without a\u00a0 certificate.\u00a0 Of course this\u00a0 decision does\u00a0 not involve\u00a0 the right <em>of children\u00a0 of Chinese laborers<\/em> to enter the territory of the United States.<\/p><p>In the present case the question is whether or not a minor child can remain in territory of the United States without the certificate required by law.\u00a0 It would seem\u00a0 to require no argument to influence an unprejudiced mind if such minor child can enter,\u00a0 without the certificate that after he has once been permitted to enter in\u00a0 order to be under the care\u00a0 and custody of his parents, he may remain in such territory without the certificate.<\/p><p>The theory of this decision is:<\/p><p>(<em>a<\/em>) \"That the law does not prohibit the entrance of such minors, under the circumstances of the present case; and<\/p><p>(<em>b<\/em>) That the minor children have a right to be under the care and protection of\u00a0 their parents.\u00a0 (Lo Po<em> vs.<\/em> McCoy, 8 Phil. Rep., 343.)<\/p><p>Our conclusions, based upon the facts in the present case and the law applicable\u00a0 thereto, are:<\/p><p>First. That the defendant, being\u00a0 a minor, would have had a right\u00a0 to enter the Philippine Islands without a certificate had his parents been living; and<\/p><p>Second. That the mere fact that his parents have died in no way changes his right to remain in the country without A\u00a0 certificate.\u00a0 His country is the country of the home\u00a0 of his parents.\u00a0 To permit him to be deported, under the circumstances\u00a0 of this\u00a0 case, would be to take him\u00a0 from the country adopted as the home of his parents, and to send him into a foreign country, among strangers.\u00a0 In our opinion no such results were contemplated by the law.<\/p><p>Upon the conclusions which we have reached, we deem it unnecessary to discuss\u00a0 the question whether the defendant\u00a0 is a citizen of the Philippine Islands or not.\u00a0\u00a0 In our opinion\u00a0 the sentence\u00a0 of the lower\u00a0 court should be and is hereby affirmed.<\/p><p><em>Torres,\u00a0 Mapa, Carson<\/em>, and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em>\u00a0 concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Three of these plantations belonged, at the time this crime was committed, to Dr. David Zavalla, Pedro Perlas, and Pablo Manguerra, respectively. The three haciendas mentioned join each other and are situated about one and one-half hour's carromata ride from the village of Santa Rosa. At the time of the commission of the crime there were employed on the hacienda of Doctor Zavalla about 20 nien, both aparceros and laborers, under the direction of one Leon Alinsod. At that time Sr. Perlas employed on his hacienda about 17 aparceros and 6 carpenters, the latter residents of the village of Santa Rosa and employed temporarily. Manuel Flores, the son-in-law of Sr. Perlas, was the superintendent of this hacienda. On the hacienda of Sr. Manguerra there were 10 aparceros and 18 laborers, the latter belonging to the municipalities of Bauan and Batangas, and having as their foreman one Reynaldo Castillo. The superintendent of this hacienda was Esteban Rico. Some miles farther to the west across the limits of the Province of La Laguna was the hacienda of Basilio Gonzalez, where, at the time in question, were employed 12 aparceros and 30 laborers. Each one of these haciendas had buildings and machinery constructed and maintained for the manufacture of sugar from the cane, near each one of which said buildings was a group of nipa houses where the aparceros and the laborers lived.<br\/><br\/>On the night of the 27th of January, 1909, the men employed on the above-mentioned haciendas disappeared therefrom and with them certain personal property belonging to the <i>hacenderos.<\/i> From the hacienda of Doctor Zavalla disappeared a horse, an ox, a carromata and a quantity of rice; from the hacienda of Sr. Perlas disappeared a horse and a shotgun; from that of Sr. Gonzalez a shotgun and a bull. On the morning following, about one-quarter of a mile from the camarin on the Zavalla hacienda at the edge of a thicket was found the mutilated corpse of Doctor Zavalla, and a short dfstance therefrom the dead body of his foreman, Leon Alinsod. The corpse of Manuel Flores of the Perlas hacienda was found a day or two later buried in a plowed field near the camarin of that hacienda.<br\/><br\/>On making these discoveries known to Governor Cailles of the Province of La Laguna, he, with the aid of the local Constabulary, took measures to discover the whereabouts of the persons who disappeared from the haciendas and to capture the thieves and murderers. Two or three days later the absent individuals began to return and to recount what had happened. They stated that during the late hours of the afternoon or the first hours of the evening of Wednesday, January 27, they were forced to leave their homes by a party of individuals who threatened them with death unless they joined their party. In order to add force to their threats, they killed in the presence of some of them the three persons whose bodies were found as above described. They stated that after having assembled the men of the different haciendas, the murderers obliged them to march toward the west in the direction of the mountains of Cavite, where they passed the night of the 27th; and that on the 28th they removed them to another place from which the most of them escaped that night.<br\/><br\/>As a result of the investigation made by the provincial government and the Constabulary, an information charging <i>robo con homicidio <\/i>and <i>bandolerismo <\/i>was presented in the court of the justice of the peace of Santa Rosa against all of the persons who appear to have been actually engaged in the acts of sequestration, robbery and murder above mentioned. After a preliminary examination twenty individuals, including the appellants in this case, were bound over to await the action of the Court of First Instance of that province. In that court, at the instance of the provincial fiscal, the information was dismissed against three of the accused. In the trial which followed six more were acquitted, and eleven condemned as guilty of the crime of <i>bandolerismo.<\/i> Those who were condemned appealed. Pablo Reyes, one of the appellants, has withdrawn his appeal and the judgment of the Court of First Instance is final as to him.<br\/><br\/>Two questions are raised on this appeal. One as to the sufficiency of the facts to sustain a conviction and the other as to the proper characterization of the crime by the trial court.<br\/><br\/>From the evidence produced it appears that on the morning of the 27th of January, 1909, Doctor Zavalla, a married man, 33 years of age, left his house in the village of Santa Rosa, in company with his little son, about two years of age, with the intention of passing the day on his hacienda. That same morning two strangers, named Nicolas Granado and Maximo Taytay, arrived at the Zavalla hacienda and were employed by the doctor to assist in the work of grinding the sugar cane. The first named, Nicolas Granado, is a nephew of the accused Bonifacio Granado, and he had been seen on the hacienda some days prior thereto. At the time in question he was stopping with his uncle. These facts are established by the testimony of Pedro Bartola who in his testimony says:<br\/><blockquote>\"I lived in the camarin of the deceased Doctor Zavalla. I have worked for him about two years. I saw him about 10 o'clock in the morning of the 27th of January. There were some persons who came to the hacienda that morning, apart from the laborers and aparceros who worked there. One was Maximo, whose surname I do not know. Another was Colas, whose surname I do not know. This said Nicolas had been there to the hacienda about a week prior to the 27th of January. That week he stayed with Bonifacio, one of the aparceros of Doctor Zavalla. Bonifacio had at this time been aparcero for about four months. Prior to that time he worked with Pedro Perlas. On this morning Maximo arrived ahead of Nicolas. This one is Maximo [indicating Maximo Taytay] and this one is Bonifacio [indicating Bonifacio Granado].\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Later on this witness, in answer to the question:<br\/><blockquote>\"Who were those who you said came there?\"<br\/><\/blockquote>replied:<br\/><blockquote>\"Nicolas and Maximo. These persons came' there that morning, the 27th of January. Maximo was the person who stayed,in the house of Bonifacio Granado the week prior to the 27th of January. It is said that Bonifacio is the uncle of Nicolas. When Nicolas and Maximo Taytay came there they talked with the superintendent Leon. They also talked with Leocadio, Before the arrival of Segundo, Leocadio, Catalino, Maximo and Rufino, Maximo and Nicolas talked with the foreman Leon and asked him to go along with them and these two were accompanied also by two others called Maximo and Cadio (probably Maximo Reyes and Leocadio Crisostomo). Maximo and Nicolas also talked with Leocadio. Leocadio approached Maximo and Nicolas, calling to them at the same time. After having talked with Leocadio, there arrived someone driving a carromata loaded with rice, who delivered a letter to Leon, whereupon Leocadio took possession of the letter.\" The witness Pablo Barroquio, speaking of the arrival of the party in question at the Zavalla hacienda on the morning of the 27th said:<br\/><br\/>\"When I was there with the other persons whom I have named, together with Doctor Zavalla, some other persons arrived on that afternoon; They were Catalino, Leocadio, Segundo, Maximo, another person named Maximo, Pablo, Macario, Bernardino, Rufino and Juan. They came on foot, some after the others. They were armed with bolos. I should be able to recognize these persons if I saw them.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On being asked to point them out, the witness said:<br\/><blockquote>\"This person, whose name I do not remember [indicating Pablo Reyes]; this one Maximo [indicating1 Maximo Reyes]; Bernardino [indicating Bernardino Martinez]; Leocadio [indicating Leocadio Crisostomo]; Segundo, whose surname I do not know; Maximo [indicating Maximo Taytay]; this one [indicating Rufino Bayadan]; this one [indicating Macario Corali]; this one, called Juan [indicating Juan de Asis].\"<\/blockquote>The witness Severino Ramirez testified in relation to the arrival of the persons on the Zavalla hacienda on the afternoon of the 27th of January that he was at work in the camarin when there approached a number of persons who obliged him to mount a carabao and follow them. On being asked who they were he replied that he did not know them by name but that he would know their faces if he saw them. He stated that these persons, with others, who took him away to the forest were Pablo Reyes, Maximo Reyes, Bernardino Martinez, Leocadio Crisostomo, Segundo Capuchino, Maximo Taytay, Macario Corali, Juan de Asis, and Rufino Bayadan.<br\/><br\/>Late in the afternoon, while the doctor was occupied in the field, about one-quarter of a mile distant from his house, directing the work of five aparceros, there approached him a group of strangers. , They were nine in number, consisting of Catalino Lachica, Leocadio Crisostomo, Segundo Capuchino, Maximo Reyes, Pablo Reyes, Bernardino Martinez, Rufino Bayadan, Juan de Asis, and Macario Corali. The identity of these men is established by the witnesses above named. As will be noticed from the testimony above given, the witness Pablo Barroquio, in addition to those above mentioned, named Maximo Taytay as one of the party. This individual is also included as one of the party by the witness Severino Ramirez above mentioned.<br\/><br\/>When the party were first seen approaching the doctor and his workmen, it was noted that one of them, Segundo Capuchino, separated from the others and started toward a field contiguous to the Per las hacienda, where two of the accused, Zacarias Patian and Crispino Ame, were working. Immediately these two were seen to accompany Segundo Capuchino to the place where the two companions of Segundo were waiting and there hold a conference with the chief of the party, Lachica. Thereafter the two went away in the direction of the camarin on the hacienda of Sr. Perlas. These facts are found stated in the testimony of Pedro Bartola.<br\/><br\/>After the conference with these two individuals, four of the nine approached Doctor Zavalla, and began a conversation with him, while the other five congregated about him menacing with their drawn bolos the men who were working for the doctor. The testimony in relation to the conversation which they had with the doctor is that, on being threatened with death if he refused to join the band, he consented to do what they required, inviting the chief, Lachica, to accompany him to the camarin to get his little boy. On seeing that the doctor had consented to accompany the party, the accused Bonifacio Granado, one of. the aparceros who had been working for the doctor in the field, cried to the four who were near the doctor, saying, \"What, are you going to leave that man alive?\" On hearing this exclamation, the four, instead of accompanying the doctor to the camarin, according to the agreement which they had reached, instantly assaulted him, whereupon the doctor began to run across the plowed field in the direction of the copse or thicket nearby. When those who were guarding the aparceros saw that their companions were attacking the doctor, they compelled them to march in the direction of the camarin. For that reason the witness whose declarations we are summarizing here did not see the result of the attack upon the doctor. The four individuals who killed Doctor Zavalla were Catalino Lachica, Leocadio Crisostomo, Segundo Capuchino, and Maximo Reyes. The identity of these men having been clearly established it results that the other five, Pablo Reyes, Bernardino Martinez, Rufino Bayadan, Juan de Asis, and Macario Corali were the persons who sequestered and guarded the aparceros while the doctor was being murdered. On arriving at the camarin the five Aparceros, who were in custody, .found there, according to the testimony of Pedro Bartola, Nicolas Granado, and Maximo Taytay. In a short time there came to the camarin the four who had had charge of the doctor but the doctor did not accompany them. On the arrival of these four, one of them, Leocadio Crisostomo, had a conversation with Nicolas Granado and Maximo Taytay, whereupon the second step in the proceedings seems to have been taken, namely, the congregation of all the aparceros and laborers at this point, where they were placed in custody between the dwelling houses and the camarin. In the meantime, there arrived at the camarin in a carromata an aparcero by the name of Catalino Tuson, coming directly from the village of Santa Rosa and fringing a letter for Leon Alinsod, the foreman of Doctor Zavalla. The latter came from, the place where he was working to the carromata to receive the letter, but the same was snatched from his hands and torn to pieces by the accused Leocadio Crisostomo. immediately thereupon, according to the declaration of the witnesses Pedro Bartola and Pablo Barroquio, four men seized Leon Alinsod and carried him in the direction of the field where Doctor Zavalla had been seen for the last time alive. Among these four men were the two who had arrived that morning at the Zavalla hacienda, namely, Nicolas Granado and Maximo Taytay, together with two of the men who had seized and killed Doctor Zavalla, namely, Leocadio Crisostomo and Maximo Reyes. When these four men returned to the place where they'were last seen with Alinsod, they returned alone. Alinsod was never seen thereafter alive.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br\/><br\/>Catalino Tuson, describing his arrival and the subsequent disappearance of foreman Alinsod, declared that the foreman was taken away by three individuals, designating Leocadio Crisostomo and Maximo Reyes as twd of them, and Segundo Capuchino as the third. Segundo Capuchino, testifying in his own behalf, stated that he was ori\u00a3of the four who killed Leon Alinsod, the other three being Nicolas Granado, Maximo Taytay and Leoeadio Crisostomo. As to the carrdmata in which Catalino Tuson arrived from the village of Santa Rosa, Pedro Bartola, and Pablo Barroquio both testified that Bonifacio Granado took the carromata, hitched to it an ox and drove the vehicle in the direction of the barrio of Bayabasah, the place where the captured workmen were guarded that night, taking with him a ]part of the rice which Tuson had brought from Santa Rosa; that Bonifacio abandoned the carromata and carried the rice to the place where Lachica and his band, together with those captured by them, reunited the following day. It was then prepared and eaten.<br\/><br\/>As to the horse taken from the hacienda of Doctor Zavalla, the record does not show clearly the particular person who had it in his possession, but it appears that, when Lachica's band arrived at the hacienda of Mr. Perlas, the horse was in their midst. It was also seen hi their possession the following day.<br\/><br\/>Doctor Zavalla and his foreman having been killed, and their property taken, and their workmen captured, as above described, the property and men were taken by Lachica and his band in the direction of the Perlas hacienda, where they arrived shortly after 6 o'clock in the evening, about the time the workmen were terminating their day's labor and returning to the camarin. Here at this hacienda was again enacted, a tragedy similar to that which we have already related. Pedro Perlas himself was not at the hacienda. There was there, however, his son-in-law and foreman, Manuel Flores. Lachica approached him and began a conversation with him, just as he had done with Doctor Zavalla. The witnesses Pedro Bartola, Pablo Barroquio, Emeterio Canin, and Catalino Tuson in their testimony agree that while Lachica and Flores were talking together, the latter was struck by a club in the hands of the accused Pablo Reyes and that after he had been felled, to the ground by this blow he was stabbled and killed by Lachica. Immediately thereupon the accused Zacarias Patian entered the house of the deceased and took his shotgun, while the accused Crispino Ame took possession of his riding whip, which he later used effectively to keep his companions in line during the march. It should be noted here that Zacarias Patian and Crispino Ame were the two individuals belonging to the Perlas hacienda who had the interview with Lachica when Lachica's party first arrived at the Zavalla hacienda.<br\/><br\/>It should also be noted, as a reason why the laborers of the three haciendas submitted so resignedly to the criminal acts of so small a party as that of Lachica, that they saw Bonifacio Granado, a workman of Doctor Zavalla, and Zacarias Patian and Crispino Ame, workmen of the Perlas hacienda, acting in conjunction with Lachica and his men in committing these acts of sequestration, robbery and assassination.<br\/><br\/>Manuel Flores, at the time of his death, had a horse and saddle near the house of Emeterio Canin, where he lived, both of which were taken by Lachica and used personally.<br\/><br\/>Before leaving the Perlas hacienda, Lachica compelled Aniceto Araela, one of the workmen of the Perlas hacienda, to dig a grave in a ploughed field near the camarin, in which the two individuals who had killed him buried the corpse of Manuel Flores.<br\/><br\/>In the meanwhile the workmen of the two haciendas, Zavalla and Perlas, were congregated in relatively the same place as were the people of the Zavalla hacienda when the party was committing its depredations there.<br\/><br\/>The witness Emeterio Canin of the Perlas hacienda recognized among those who formed the Lachica party the eight persons, with the exception of Juan de Asis, who accompanied Lachica when the crimes were committed at the Zavalla hacienda.<br\/><br\/>The accused Bernardino Martinez was pointed out in particular by the witness Pastor Baguian, one of the aparceros of the Perlas hacienda, as one of the three individuals who ordered him to dismount from his carabao when he arrived from his work. The accused Macario Corali, one of the original party of nine, is specifically designated by the witness Aniceto. Ariela of the Perlas hacienda as one of the persons actively engaged in intimidating the workmen of the Perlas hacienda and of maintaining them in custody. He was also seen by this witness the following day in the woods setting the captured workmen in line for the march.<br\/><br\/>While the majority of the workmen captured on the Perlas and Zavalla haciendas were congregated on the Perlas hacienda in the custody of some of the Lachica party, the remainder of them were taken by others of Lachica's band to the Manguerra hacienda. Arriving there, Lachica and the accused Zacarias Patian entered the house and were informed by Herarda and Josef a Manguerra, the two oldest daughters of the owner of the hacienda, of the whereabouts of their father. When the murderers entered the house these two young ladies were about to seat themselves at supper and they invited the bandoleros to eat with them; but, when Lachica informed them that he had killed Doctor Zavalla and that there was a general uprising or revolution, they began to understand the gravity of the situation, and, when Lachica intimated to them that they must go with the others to Bayabasan, they did not hesitate a moment in complying with his order. In explanation of his act requiring the young ladies to accompany him, Lachica told them that he feared if he left them behind they would denounce him to the authorities. From the testimony of Reynaldo Castillo, foreman of the Manguerra hacienda, one of the three laborers from Bauan, it appears that the workmen of the Manguerra hacienda obeyed the orders of the bandoleros^ having been informed of the frightful crimes committed on the Zavalla and Perlas haciendas, and having been threatened with death in case they refused to follow Lachica and his band. This witness asserts specifically that when he arrived at the Perlas hacienda, he saw there the accused Venancio Marasigan. The following day he again saw . Ven&amp;ncio Marasigan in the forest. He also states that Marasigan carried a shotgun until the time when he saw that he was likely to fall into the hands of the Constabulary. He then threw it into a ploughed field. This accused confessed to Lieut. Antonio Gomez that that was what he did with the gun, and it was later found in the place where it had been thrown by Marasigan and returned to its owner. According to the testimony of the witness Narciso Aleriano, one of the workmen of Basilio Gonzales, it appears that on the 28th of January the murderers killed and ate ah ox belonging to Gonzalez. The witness pointed out among those who were present at the commission of this robbery all of the accused except Macarib Corali, one of the original party of nine.<br\/><br\/>The number and the identity of the individuals who composed the original party of nine is admitted by three of said party, who testified as witnesses for the defense.<br\/><br\/>The learned counsel for the appellants have elaborately argued that the crime proved is not <i>bandolerismo,<\/i> and have cited numerous authorities to support their contention. We are of the opinion, however, that whether or not the crime committed was bandolerismo is not necessarily of decisive importance in this case.\u00a0\u00a0 The facts alleged in the information fully, clearly and distinctly charge^ the crime of robbery with homicide, as defined and penalized in article 503, paragraph 1, of the Penal Code, as well as the crime pf <i>bandolerismo.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 The information reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"That on or about the 27th day of January, 1909, in the municipality of Santa Rosa, Province of La Laguna, the said accused Arsenio de Guzman, etc., conspiring together, organized a band of robbers, armed with deadly weapons, for the purpose of sequestering persons by means of force and violence, and to rob and appropriate to their own use various kinds of personal property;<br\/><br\/>\"That in obedience to such purposes the said accused, armed with bolos and other deadly weapons and led by the accused, Catalino Lachica, captured and sequestered, oil or about the 27th day of January, 1909, by nieans of intimidation, force and violence, a large, number of persons, residents of the barrio of Camaligan, of the said municipality of Santa Rosa, and of. Bayabasan, in the municipality of Silang, Province of Cayite, compelling and obliging the said persons to go with them to the mountains and forests of said Province of Cavite;<br\/><br\/>\"That also in obedience to such purpose the accused appropriated to their own use, and to the use of the band or its chiefs, on or about the 27th day of January, 1909, the following goods and personal!property, the property of one David Zavalla, to wit, one horse, one steer, one carreteta and a cavan of rice; also the following goods and personal property belonging to one Manuel Floret to wit, one shotgun and one watch; also some ammunition belonging to one Pablo Manguerra; also one ox and one gun belonging to one Basilio Gonzalez;<br\/><br\/>\"That in obedience also to the purpose to capture men, to rob and appropriate personal property, said accused attacked with bolos and other deadly weapons and killed, on the 27th day of January, 1909, aforesaid, the following persons, to wit, Doctor David Zavalla,; Leon Alihsod, and Manuel Flores.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The crime of <i>bandolerismo,<\/i> as set out in the above information, includes the crime of robbery with homicide. We have repeatedly held that an accused may, the proofs warranting it, be convicted of any crime described and charged by the facts set out in the information irrespective of the characterization of the crime made by the prosecuting officer. The situation of the accused would not be improved by a conviction of robbery with homicide rather than <i>bandolerismo.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The learned trial court found the appellants herein guilty of <i>bandolerismo<\/i> and sentenced them as follows: Leocadio Crisostomo and Maximo Reyes to the penalty of death; Segundo Capuchino and Maximo Taytay each to thirty years' imprisonment; Bernardino Martinez, Venancio Marasigan, Bonifacio Granado, and Macario 6orali, twenty years each; and Zacarias Patian and Crispino Ame, twenty-five years each.<br\/><br\/>Whether from the standpoint of <i>bandolerismo <\/i>or of robbery with homicide, we can see no reason whatever why the same sentence should not have been pronounced against Segundo Capuchino and Maximo Taytay as was pronounced against Leocadio Crisostomo and Maximo Reyes. As we have pointed out in the discussion of the proofs in this case, the evidence conclusively demonstrates that each of these two men took direct and active part in at least one brutal, atrocious, and treacherous murder and lent their presence and aid in others. We are confident that the learned trial court erred in fixing the penalty in these two cases. For these reasons the judgment of the court below is hereby modified in such way that Segundo Capuchino and Maximo Taytay are each sentenced to death, as they hereby are. So modified the judgment is affirmed, with costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

As Macugay did not return the\u00a0 earrings nor deliver their price,\u00a0 as agreed,\u00a0 Quiaoit, on\u00a0 the following\u00a0 day, went to Macugay's house and demanded of her the return of.\u00a0 the earrings or the delivery of their price, on which occasion he found in the latter's house another woman named Cayetana Sebastian, to\u00a0 whom\u00a0 Macugay said\u00a0 she had\u00a0 delivered\u00a0 the earrings.\u00a0 Cayetana acknowledged that she had received the jewels from the latter and, in turn,\u00a0 stated that she had delivered them to one Juana Martinez\u00a0 who had commissioned her to bring to the said Martinez a\u00a0 pair of earrings as\u00a0 the latter desired to secure them for another person.\u00a0 After Martinez has received the earrings ordered from Sebastian, she would neither return them to the latter nor pay their price, saying that\u00a0 she should keep them until the latter had paid the sum of P60 which she, Sebastian, owed to Bias Almazan, Martinez' uncle.\u00a0 Then Quiaoit,\u00a0 accompanied by Catalina Macugay and Cayetana Sebastian, went to the said Almazan and Martinez and begged them to return to him the earrings as they belonged to him and not to\u00a0 Cayetana Sebastian, but they denied his request, saying that they would not return the earrings until Sebastian had paid her debt to Almazan.\u00a0 A complaint alleging coercion was then filed in the court of the justice of the peace of Laoag and a judgment of conviction was therein\u00a0 rendered.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants appealed to the Court of First\u00a0 Instance of Ilocos Norte, which, at the petition of the provincial fiscal, dismissed the case, but reserved the\u00a0 right to the\u00a0 fiscal to file another complaint for <em>estafa<\/em> against the defendants.<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons, on January 11, 1910, a complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal in the Court of First Instance of the aforesaid province, charging the said Bias Almazan and Juana Martinez with the crime of <em>estafa<\/em>, and the case having come to trial, the court, on August 29, 1910, rendered judgment by sentencing the two defendants to the penalty of six months of <em>arresto mayor,<\/em>\u00a0 to the accessory penalties, to return the earrings or pay their value, P180, and, in case of insolvency, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, not to exceed one-third of\u00a0 the time of the principal: penalty,\u00a0 and to the payment of the costs.\u00a0 From this judgment the defendants appealed.<\/p><p>From\u00a0 the facts before related, which\u00a0 were perfectly proved at the trial, it is concluded that the\u00a0 crime of <em>estafa,<\/em> as punished by articles 534, No. 2, and 535, No. 5, of the Penal Code, was actually committed, inasmuch as, to the prejudice of Francisco Quiaoit, a pair of gold earrings with diamond settings,\u00a0 valued at P180, belonging to the latter, was appropriated\u00a0 or misapplied by Juana Martinez who received\u00a0 the same to sell on commission under the\u00a0 condition that she should return\u00a0 them or pay their value to the bearer thereof, and not only did the said Martinez fail to comply with these conditions, but she refused to return the jewels on the pretext that they had been delivered to her by\u00a0 their bearer,\u00a0 Cayetana\u00a0 Sebastian, in payment amount which the latter owed to Martinez' uncle,\u00a0 Blas Almazan.<\/p><p>It is a fact that Cayetana Sebastian owed P60 to Blas Almazan and that the latter's niece, Juana Martinez, proposed\u00a0 that her uncle should collect that amount from his debtor, Sebastian, and for that purpose employed deceit and fraud by commissioning the said debtor to bring her a pair of earrings on the pretext that she desired to acquire them for another, a third person; and'the broker,\u00a0 Cayetana Sebastian, who\u00a0 obtained the jewels\u00a0 belonging\u00a0 to\u00a0 Francisco Quiaoit, through the mediation of another woman, Catalina Macugay, who had received the said earrings from their owner,\u00a0 believing\u00a0 Martinez'\u00a0 statements, fell into the\u00a0 trap which\u00a0 the latter had prepared and delivered the earrings to her.\u00a0\u00a0 Though the bearer of the jewels and not the said Quiaoit was directly the victim of the deceit, the truth is that it was the owner thereof who suffered the detriment, inasmuch as the pair of earrings disappeared and it was Juana Martinez who was benefited thereby in the sum of P130, for which\u00a0 they were pawned to Simeon Mandac, as stated by Mandac in his letter addressed to the clerk of the Court of First Instance and\u00a0 which is to be\u00a0 found on page 5 of the trial record.<\/p><p>While Francisco Quiaoit was endeavoring to recover his earrings, he had an interview with Juana\u00a0 Martinez; he was accompanied\u00a0 on this occasion\u00a0 by Catalina Macugay,\u00a0 who had received the jewels from him to sell, and by Cayetana Sebastian, who had obtained them from Macugay to deliver them to Juana Martinez, at the latter's request.\u00a0 In spite of Quiaoit's\u00a0 representations that\u00a0 he\u00a0 was the\u00a0 legitimate owner of the jewels, Juana Martinez refused to return them, saying that Cayetana Sebastian had delivered the same\u00a0 to her in\u00a0 payment of the sum which the latter owed to Martinez' uncle, Bias Almazan, and that she\u00a0 would not return the jewels\u00a0 unless the said Sebastian should pay the debt.\u00a0 The defense tried to prove that Cayetana Sebastian was at the house of the\u00a0 defendant Martinez on March 28, 1909, and delivered the\u00a0 said\u00a0 earrings\u00a0 to her in\u00a0 payment\u00a0 of her (Sebastian's)\u00a0 debt of P130.\u00a0\u00a0 This delivery was alleged to have been made in the presence of the witness Modesta Segundo, who so testified.\u00a0\u00a0 The allegation of the delivery of the earrings in payment of a debt of P130 can not be held to have been proven by the testimony of the witness Segundo, inasmuch as it does not appear to have been corroborated by the testimony of the\u00a0 defendants themselves.\u00a0 Besides the\u00a0 debt was owing to Bias\u00a0 Almazan and\u00a0 not to Juana Martinez and\u00a0 only amounted to P60, not P130 as the said witness\u00a0 testified.<\/p><p>Even\u00a0 though it were true that Cayetana\u00a0 Sebastian did deliver the\u00a0 said jewels to Juana Martinez in payment of what she might\u00a0 have been owing the latter, yet,\u00a0 as the jewels belonged to Francisco Quiaoit and not to their bearer Sebastian, Quiaoit could not lose his property without his consent, and he is entitled to\u00a0 recover the same from\u00a0 Martinez who appropriated\u00a0 it.\u00a0\u00a0 As such\u00a0 appropriation was effected by means of deceit, for the record shows no proof that Sebastian did deliver Quiaoit's jewels in payment of a debt of her own, as the\u00a0 defense endeavored to prove, but under the pretext that another, a third person, wished to acquire them,\u00a0 and as the fraudulent act by which Juana Martinez succeeded in obtaining the possession of the jewels occasioned serious detriment\u00a0 to their owner\u00a0 who\u00a0 was deprived of them by means\u00a0 of\u00a0 a fraudulent transaction effected by the said\u00a0 Martinez\u00a0 who, in turn, obtained lucre by pawning the said jewels to Simeon Mandac for the sum of P130, more than\u00a0 double the amount of the debt which she tried to collect from the broker, Cayetana Sebastian\u00a0\u00a0 the commission of the crime of <em>estafa<\/em> is manifestly shown, and\u00a0 the sole person\u00a0 responsible for its\u00a0 perpetration is the said Juana Martinez, since it\u00a0 was she alone who managed to secure the jewels by means of deceit, she who misapplied the same by pawning them without the knowledge\u00a0 of tne broker or of the owner of the property, and\u00a0 is the sole person who\u00a0 obtained lucre from the transaction by collecting P130 from Simeon Mandac who afterwards would not or could not return the jewels, under the pretext that they had been lost.<\/p><p>It does not appear from the\u00a0 proceedings that Blas Almazan had any hand in the commission of the crime under prosecution, either as a principal or as an accessory before or after the fact, for it was not proven that he took a direct part in the perpetration of the crime,\u00a0 or had\u00a0 directly induced his niece, Juana Martinez, to commit it, or that he had at least cooperated\u00a0 in its\u00a0 consummation\u00a0 by previous\u00a0 or simultaneous acts, or that he had\u00a0 derived any benefit or profit from the crime or\u00a0 assisted\u00a0 Juana Martinez\u00a0 in its commission with knowledge of the perpetration of the said crime of <em>estafa,<\/em> for, even though he may have received from her the amount of Cayetana Sebastian's debt to\u00a0 him, it was not proved that he had any knowledge that his niece Martinez,\u00a0 in collecting or obtaining\u00a0 the said\u00a0 sum, committed <em>estafa<\/em>:\u00a0 for these reasons, no grounds are found whereon he may be held criminally liable for this crime.<\/p><p>With respect to the three errors attributed by the defense to the judgment appealed from, the first two are, of course, for the reasons hereinbefore given, understood to be refuted. The third consists in the failure of the lower court to take account of the plea of jeopardy set up on the ground that the defendants were sentenced by the justice of the peace to the penalty of two\" months' imprisonment and to\u00a0 pay a fine of 325 pesetas for the crime of coercion, although afterwards, through their having appealed to the Court of First Instance, the case was, on motion of the\u00a0 fiscal, dismissed, with the reservation that he might file another complaint for\u00a0 <em>estafa<\/em>.\u00a0 Notwithstanding\u00a0 the arguments advanced by the defense, the defendants, on account of such\u00a0 prosecution for coercion, can not be held to have been placed\u00a0 in jeopardy and that therefore in\u00a0 accordance with the law they may not now be prosecuted again for\u00a0 the crime of <em>estafa.<\/em><\/p><p>Aside from\u00a0 other reasons that might well be given, tending to show that the defendants have not been placed in jeopardy, it fe sufficient for the purpose of this decision to state that the aforementioned justice of the peace had no jurisdiction whatever to try cases for the crime of coercion, provided for and punished by article 497 of the Penal Code, by the penalty of <em>arresto mayor<\/em> and a fine of\u00a0 from 325 to 3,250\u00a0 <em>pesetas<\/em>, a sum greater than that\u00a0 of P200 fixed\u00a0 by section 4 of Act No. 1627 as within the original jurisdiction of a justice of the peace; and therefore, all the proceedings had by the justice of the peace were null and void and could produce no effect in favor of the defendants in support of a plea of jeopardy in this cause for <em>estafa<\/em>.<\/p><p>As regards the motion made by counsel for the defendants, for\u00a0 a rehearing, on account of the\u00a0 discovery of new evidence of great importance in the decision of this case, this court\u00a0 also rules that it is inadmissible, for the reason that, if it\u00a0 is true that Salustiano Baleba was at the house of\u00a0 Blas Almazan when\u00a0 Cayetana Sebastian delivered\u00a0 the pair of earrings to Juana Martinez, saying that she did so in payment of her debt, the\u00a0 defendants knew\u00a0 at the time of the trial that Baleba was present during such delivery of the\u00a0 jewels\u00a0 and heard\u00a0 the statement made by Cayetana Sebastian on paying her debt with the earrings; therefore the defendants, in adducing proof in defense of their rights, should have summoned this witness and availed themselves of\u00a0 his testimony, and,\u00a0 were he absent, they even could have asked for a continuance.\u00a0 But the fact\u00a0 is that\u00a0 the defendants' counsel took no such action, notwithstanding that his clients were aware that the testimony of the\u00a0 said witness might be favorable to them.\u00a0 The said\u00a0 testimony can\u00a0 not,\u00a0 therefore, be\u00a0 considered as\u00a0 newly\u00a0 discovered evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the statements\u00a0 made by Salustiano Baleba, though\u00a0 admitted, would be mere cumulative\u00a0 evidence which would not alter the result, inasmuch as it would not establish a new fact, but at most would corroborate the testimony of the witness Modesta Segundo.<\/p><p>For the reasons herein set forth, it\u00a0 is proper, in\u00a0 our opinion, to sentence, as\u00a0 we hereby do, Juana Martinez\u00a0 to the penalty of six months of\u00a0 <em>arresto mayor<\/em>, to the accessories\u00a0 of article 61 of the code, to\u00a0 return the pair of\u00a0 earrings, or, in default of the same, their Value\u00a0 of P180, to their owner, Francisco Quiaoit, and, in case of. insolvency, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment\u00a0 which shall not\u00a0 exceed one-third of\u00a0 the principal\u00a0 penalty, and to the payment of\u00a0 the\u00a0 costs in both\u00a0 instances;\u00a0 and to\u00a0 acquit, as we hereby do, Bias Almazan, with the other half of the costs <em>de\u00a0 oficio<\/em>.\u00a0 The judgment appealed from is thus affirmed in so far as it is\u00a0 in accord with this decision, and is reversed in so far as it is not, and\u00a0 we deny the exception alleged of jeopardy and the petition for a new\u00a0 trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence of great importance for the proper decision of this case.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em> Mapa<\/em> and <em>Johnson, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<br\/><em>Carson<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ<\/em>., concur in the dispositive part.<\/p><\/div>",

Rep,, 13). It appears to rest on a misconception of the true meaning of\u00a0 the\u00a0 language used\u00a0 in the\u00a0 former\u00a0 decision, a misconception\u00a0 which may well have had its origin in the imperfect and doubtless misleading translation of the original Spanish\u00a0 text found in the\u00a0 English version published in the official reports.<br\/><br\/>The English text of the former decision makes the court, in discussing the legal status which resulted from the transactions therein set out, expressly declare that\u00a0 it\u00a0 was\u00a0 the duty\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 <i>bank<\/i> to\u00a0 have, hold and reserve funds of\u00a0 the drawer to the amount of the lost check, for the\u00a0 payment of the new check, the execution\u00a0 of which was\u00a0 authorized and directed\u00a0 in that decision; whereas the original Spanish version nowhere\u00a0 imposed such a duty upon the bank.\u00a0\u00a0 The only\u00a0 obligation which\u00a0 the\u00a0 original\u00a0 decision expressly recognized\u00a0 as\u00a0 resting on the bank was\u00a0 the \"stoppage\" of payment on the lost check in compliance with the judicial order which the bank obligated itself to respect and obey. It is true, that in directing and authorizing the issuing of a new check, we said that we did so in order that the payee of the lost check might be able therewith to draw out the funds which ought to be reserved in the bank for its payment. But beyond its obligation\u00a0 to \"stop\" payment of the\u00a0 lost check, the duty to reserve\u00a0 these funds in the bank\u00a0 clearly rested, not on the bank, but upon the drawer of the original check, to whose credit these funds originally stood in his checking account with the bank.<br\/><br\/>The judgment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the court\u00a0 below should be\u00a0 affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J.,\u00a0 Mapa, Moreland<\/i>, and\u00a0 <i>Trent, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

The judge wlio had before him two or more crimes, jointly prosecuted in a lawful manner in\u00a0 one cause, and whose duty it was to apply two or more penalties corresponding to the two or more crimes comprehended in\u00a0 the prosecution, had to ascertain which was the severest of the several penalties, and when he had fixed the time which, of this severest penalty, should be imposed,\u00a0 in accordance with the said provision of the Penal Code, for\u00a0 the several crimes, he\u00a0 could\u00a0 impose upon\u00a0 the culprit\u00a0 but one\u00a0 sentence, the duration of which\u00a0 could not exceed three times the time which\u00a0 the most severe of the penalties that he may have incurred <i>should have imposed <\/i>on him, etc.\u00a0 The\u00a0 legal text of the\u00a0 provision cited apparently indicates the\u00a0 propriety of a judge's trying and sentencing\u00a0 an\u00a0 accused for two or more crjmes in one prosecution.<br\/><br\/>With the exception of a few of the first decisions rendered by the\u00a0 supreme court of Spain\u00a0 in relation to this subject matter, the jurisprudence\u00a0 established by it, in\u00a0 the\u00a0 sense aforesaid, has been constantly and repeatedly followed.<br\/><blockquote>\"The limitation established in\u00a0 rule\u00a0 2\u00a0 of article 89 of the Penal Code [88 of that of the Philippines], for the imposition of penalties,\u00a0 is\u00a0 applicable only to the crimes which\u00a0 are prosecuted in a single cause\u00a0 wherein, by reason of their number or of the entity of the\u00a0 penalties that must be applied, it may become necessary to impose more than three penalties or more than forty years' imprisonment, in which case not more than three times the period of the penalty which corresponds to the\u00a0 most serious crime may be applied,\u00a0 and in no\u00a0 case may\u00a0 a penalty exceed forty years.\u00a0\u00a0 This does not mean that a penalty which the accused has incurred should not be applied because in\u00a0 other causes and for other crimes he was sentenced\u00a0 to more than forty years.\"\u00a0 (Decision of April 8, 1903.)<\/blockquote>The\u00a0 judgment appealed from\u00a0 is affirmed with\u00a0 the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>,\u00a0 concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Those who have been duly licensed\u00a0 under the laws and orders of the Islands under the sovereignty of Spain or of the\u00a0 United States and are in good and regular standing as members\u00a0 of the bar of the Philippine Islands\u00a0 at the time of the\u00a0 adoption\u00a0 of this code;\u00a0 Provided,\u00a0 That any person\u00a0 who,\u00a0 prior\u00a0 to the passage\u00a0 of this\u00a0 Act, or at any time thereafter,\u00a0 shall have held, under\u00a0 the authority\u00a0 of the United States,\u00a0 the\u00a0 position of justice of the Supreme Court, judge of the Court of First Instance, or judge\u00a0 or associate judge of the Court of Land Registration, of the Philippine Islands, or the\u00a0 position\u00a0 of\u00a0 Attorney-General, Solicitor-General,\u00a0 Assistant Attorney-General,\u00a0 Assistant Attorney in the office of the Attorney-General, prosecuting attorney for the city of Manila, assistant\u00a0 prosecuting attorney\u00a0 for the\u00a0 city\u00a0 of Manila,\u00a0 city\u00a0 attorney\u00a0 of\u00a0 Manila, assistant city attorney of Manila, provincial fiscal, attorney for the Moro Province, or assistant attorney for the Moro Province, may be licensed to practice law in the courts\u00a0 of the Philippine Islands without an examination, upon motion before\u00a0 the Supreme Court and establishing such fact to the satisfaction of said court.'\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>That portion of section 15 of Act No. 1698, by authority of which applicant claims that he was appointed an acting assistant prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila, is as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"In case of a temporary absence or\u00a0 disability of any subordinate officer or\u00a0 employee in any Bureau or Office, the chief of such Bureau or Office may designate any other subordinate officer or\u00a0 employee in\u00a0 his Bureau or\u00a0 Office temporarily to perform the duties of the officer or employee who is\u00a0 thus absent or disabled, and it shall be the duty of the person so\u00a0 designated to perform the duties so assigned to him without additional compensation.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Upon the\u00a0 showing\u00a0 made\u00a0 by the\u00a0 applicant, we do not think that he comes within either the\u00a0 letter or the spirit of\u00a0 the provisions of section 2 of Act No. 1597, on which he\u00a0 bases\u00a0 his application.<\/p><p>Applicant does not claim that he\u00a0 was\u00a0 appointed to the office of assistant prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila. His claim is\u00a0 that\u00a0 he\u00a0 was\u00a0 appointed an\u00a0 acting assistant prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila;\u00a0 but the privilege conferred in\u00a0 express\u00a0 terms in\u00a0 section\u00a0 2\u00a0 of\u00a0 Act No. 1597, upon which he relies, is conferred upon one who has \"held\"\u00a0 the position of assistant prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila, and makes no express provision touching one who has held the position of an acting assistant prosecuting attorney.<\/p><p>Applicant, however, contends that his appointment as an acting assistant prosecuting attorney for the city of Manila, under the provisions of section 15 of Act No.\u00a0 1698, was a sufficient authorization to him to hold\u00a0 the office of assistant prosecuting attorney for the city of Manila; and that he\u00a0 did,\u00a0 in fact,<em> hold<\/em> that office and perform the duties thereof\u00a0 for several months.\u00a0\u00a0 We do not\u00a0 think that this contention is or can be sustained by the terms of the statute upon which applicant relies.<\/p><p>Without considering whether section 15 of Act No. 1698 contemplates or authorizes the making of appointments in the form in which applicant's appointment was made, that is to say, as an acting assistant prosecuting attorney, it is very clear that whatever form be adopted by the prosecuting attorney for the city of Manila in designating subordinate officers and employees in\u00a0 his office temporarily to perform the duties of\u00a0 an absent or disabled\u00a0 assistant prosecuting attorney, his action,\u00a0 if taken under the authority conferred upon\u00a0 him by\u00a0 section 15 of Act No.\u00a0 1698, can amount to no\u00a0 more\u00a0 than a mere designation and authorization\u00a0 to such person <em>temporarily<\/em> to perform the duties of the absent or disabled\u00a0 official, without\u00a0 additional compensation.\u00a0\u00a0 The language\u00a0 of the statute leaves no room\u00a0 for doubt that a subordinate officer or employee designated temporarily to perform the duties of another,\u00a0 continues to \"hold\" his own office\u00a0 or employment with\u00a0 all its rights and\u00a0 privileges; and there is nothing in the statute\u00a0 which indicates\u00a0 that it was the intention\u00a0 of the legislator that he\u00a0 is to enjoy, in addition thereto, any of the\u00a0 rights and privileges of the official whose\u00a0 duties\u00a0 he is designated temporarily to\u00a0 perform, except only, of course, such rights and\u00a0 privileges as are necessarily incident to the actual performance of\u00a0 the duties of the absent\u00a0 or\u00a0 disabled official.<\/p><p>But not only does the designation of the applicant temporarily to perform\u00a0 the duties\u00a0 of an\u00a0 assistant prosecuting attorney for the city of Manila fail\u00a0 to bring him within the strict letter of the law\u00a0 authorizing\u00a0 the admission\u00a0 of such officials to the bar without examination; in our opinion it fails also to bring him within the spirit or the intent of the provisions of the above-cited section 2 of Act No. 1597.<\/p><p>Public policy demands that any person seeking admission to the bar in these\u00a0 Islands\u00a0 be required\u00a0 to furnish satisfactory proof of his educational and moral qualifications and of his possession of such a degree\u00a0 of learning and proficiency in the law as may\u00a0 be\u00a0 deemed necessary for the due performance\u00abof the duties of a lawyer.\u00a0\u00a0 The learning and proficiency in the law of an applicant for admission to the bar ia usually ascertained by requiring him to submit himself to an examination.\u00a0 But\u00a0 section 2 of Act No. 1597 provides, substantially, that officials who have held certain specified judicial and\u00a0 legal offices in these\u00a0 Islands will be presumed to have the necessary learning and\u00a0 proficiency in the law to entitle them to admission to the bar without examination.\u00a0 Of course, a\u00a0 mere appointment to one of these offices could not\u00a0 impart such learning\u00a0 and\u00a0 proficiency in the law to one who was without\u00a0 it at the time of\u00a0 his appointment, and it is clear that\u00a0 this presumption must rest on the further presumption\u00a0 that\u00a0 before\u00a0 any person is appointed\u00a0 to any of the positions mentioned in the Act, due inquiry is made as to his character and qualifications, and that no person will be appointed to such positions who has not at least such a degree of learning and proficiency in the law as would entitle him to admission to practice in the various courts in these Islands.\u00a0 Appointments to the positions mentioned in Act No. 1597 are made either by the President of the United States\u00a0 by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, or by the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands\u00a0 by and with the advice and consent of the Philippine Commission, and\u00a0 the legislator evidently conceived that the fact that such an\u00a0 appointment is made is a sufficient guaranty that after due\u00a0 inquiry the appointee has been found to be\u00a0 possessed of at least the necessary qualifications for\u00a0 admission to the bar.<\/p><p>But no such presumption arises as to the qualification of one who\u00a0 is merely designated temporarily to perform the duties of one of the officials mentioned in the Act.\u00a0 Under the provisions of section 15 of Act No. 1698, the Attorney-General of the Islands, the city attorney and the prosecuting attorney\u00a0 for\u00a0 the city of\u00a0 Manila and the attorney for the Moro Province may each\u00a0 designate any\u00a0 subordinate officer or employee in their respective offices\u00a0 temporarily to perform the duties of an absent or disabled assistant attorney.\u00a0 In making such designation for temporary duty, there is no such obligation upon the chiefs of these offices to look well to the qualifications as a lawyer of the employee thus designated, as there is upon the Chief Executive to look well to the qualifications of a\u00a0 regular appointee to such\u00a0 an office; and\u00a0 it is\u00a0 easy to imagine cases where an employee not learned in the\u00a0 law, or at most with some knowledge and experience in a\u00a0 single\u00a0 branch of the law such as\u00a0 criminal practice and\u00a0 procedure, might\u00a0 properly be designated\u00a0 temporarily to perform\u00a0 the duties\u00a0 of an assistant attorney in one or other of those offices, although his permanent appointment to such\u00a0 an office would not be justified by his general attainments as\u00a0 a lawyer.\u00a0 There is no such guaranty that only competent attorneys will be designated\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 chiefs\u00a0 of\u00a0 these\u00a0 offices temporarily to perform the duties of absent\u00a0 assistant attorneys\u00a0 under the provisions\u00a0 of section 15\u00a0 of\u00a0 Act No. 1698, as\u00a0 there\u00a0 is that the President\u00a0 of the United States by and with the advice\u00a0 and\u00a0 consent of the Senate, and the Governor-General\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Philippine Islands by and with the consent of the Commission will appoint none but competent attorneys permanently to occupy the important\u00a0 judicial and\u00a0 legal positions expressly mentioned\u00a0 in section 2 of Act No. 1597.<\/p><p>We do not believe that\u00a0 it was the intention of the legislator to put it in the power of the Attorney-General of the Islands, of the city attorney and the prosecuting attorney for the city of Manila,\u00a0 and of the attorney for the Moro Province arbitrarily, and in\u00a0 the exercise of\u00a0 their unrestrained\u00a0 discretion to confer upon subordinate officers and employees in their offices the\u00a0 right to admission to the bar in these Islands without\u00a0 examination;\u00a0 and we hold that subordinate officers and employees designated temporarily to perform the duties of absent or disabled assistant attorneys do not hold the positions of such absent or\u00a0 disabled assistant attorneys in the sense in\u00a0 which the legislator contemplated the holding of those positions in section 2 of Act No.\u00a0 1597, in order to give one who has held them the right to\u00a0 admission to practice law\u00a0 in these Islands without taking the prescribed examination.<\/p><p>The application should be, and is, denied.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J., Torres,\u00a0 Mapa,\u00a0 Johnson, Moreland, <\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

The plaintiff presented a motion on September 11, 1911, to the presid- ing judge, one\u00a0 of the defendants in the case at bar, asking that said appeal be dismissed.\u00a0 This motion was based upon the ground that the defendant RosaJes had\u00a0 not only failed to present an appeal bond, but had also failed to pay the damages and costs as required by Act No. 1778.\u00a0 The defendant judge denied this motion, but directed the appellant in that case (Rosales) to present the bond required by said Act\u00a0 within twenty-four\u00a0 hours.\u00a0 The bond\u00a0 was presented as directed.\u00a0 On\u00a0 the following day, the 12th of September, the plaintiff presented another motion, which was likewise denied, in which\u00a0 she again asked the court to dismiss\u00a0 said appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 latter\u00a0 motion\u00a0 was based upon\u00a0 the same grounds as the\u00a0 first.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff now contends that her\u00a0 only plain,\u00a0 speedy, and adequate remedy to obtain the relief sought is through this court in an action of mandamus.<br\/><br\/>Section 2 of\u00a0 Act No. 1778, amending section 88 of Act No. 190,\u00a0 provides among other things that if the defendant appeals from the judgment of the justice of\u00a0 the peace in cases\u00a0 of unlawful detainer of real property:<br\/><blockquote>\"He shall give\u00a0 to the plaintiff security by an obligation, with sufficient sureties, approved by the justice of the peace, to enter\u00a0 the action\u00a0 in the Court of First Instance,\u00a0 and to pay rents, damages, and costs, and the defendant\u00a0 and the sureties shall be liable upon their obligation for damages and costs,\u00a0 down to the time of final judgment in the action.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This section\u00a0 further\u00a0 provides that -<br\/><blockquote>\"The appeal shall not be allowed until such obligation has been filed with the justice and it is proven that at the time such appeal is taken all money found\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment to be due from the defendant to the plaintiff, either as rent or as the reasonable value of the use and occupation of the premises, as the case may be, has been paid to the plaintiff or deposited in\u00a0 the court.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The defendant, in the justice of the peace court, did not comply or even attempt to comply with these express provisions of the statute.\u00a0 He presented, as we\u00a0 have\u00a0 said, in that court no bond\u00a0 or obligation whatever, neither did he offer to present\u00a0 any such obligation.\u00a0\u00a0 He did not pay or deposit or offer to do so the damages and costs.\u00a0 He presented a bond only when directed to do so by the Court of First Instance, after the\u00a0 plaintiff had presented\u00a0 a motion asking that court to dismiss the appeal. He has not yet paid or deposited the damages and costs.<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 has been\u00a0 suggested that as the\u00a0 plaintiff failed to except to the order of the court denying her first\u00a0 motion, she, by this failure, waived her rights with reference to the bond.\u00a0 It is true that she did not enter a formal exception to this ruling of the court, but she did immediately present another\u00a0 motion, again asking\u00a0 the\u00a0 court\u00a0 to\u00a0 dismiss\u00a0 that appeal and this motion was based upon the ground that the defendant\u00a0 had failed to present the bond as\u00a0 required by the statute and also that he had failed to pay or deposit the costs and damages.\u00a0\u00a0 A formal exception could have availed her nothing, as\u00a0 she could\u00a0 not have appealed to this court from the final judgment of the Court of First Instance in that case.\u00a0 The\u00a0 fact that\u00a0 she presented this second motion immediately\u00a0 after the\u00a0 ruling of the\u00a0 court on her first motion, shows conclusively that\u00a0 she did not\u00a0 consent to\u00a0 that order or waive any of her rights in the premises.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Tirangbuaya <i>vs.<\/i> Judge of First Instance of Rizal (14\u00a0 Phil. Rep. 613), this court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"We have frequently held that the Legislature, under its general authority to regulate appellate procedure, may require appeal bonds of the appellant in both civil and crim- inal cases, and in our decisions we have on many occasions recognized\u00a0 and\u00a0 accepted the\u00a0 general principle that\u00a0 acts required by statute to perfect\u00a0 an appeal are jurisdictional, and must be complied with to vest the appellate court with power\u00a0 to\u00a0 entertain\u00a0 the appeal.\u00a0 Manifestly,\u00a0 therefore, neither the appellate nor the trial court, over the objection of\u00a0 appellee, can dispense with\u00a0 the statutory\u00a0 security or accept a security of a different character from\u00a0 that named in the statute, and it follows,\u00a0 as of course, that where no bond is given, the appeal must, upon motion of the appellee, be dismissed or stricken from\u00a0 the docket, unless it appears that the requirement has been waived by the appellee, as a\u00a0 technical\u00a0 step in appellate procedure purely\u00a0 for the appellee's benefit.<br\/><br\/>\"So\u00a0 also when an instrument purporting to be an appeal bond is so fatally defective as to be\u00a0 absolutely void or is not such an instrument as\u00a0 is contemplated by the statute, the appellate court acquires no jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 (Macondray &amp; Co.\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i> Quintero et al., 6 Phil. Rep., 429.)<br\/><br\/>\"But an appeal bond\u00a0 or\u00a0 undertaking is sufficient where it substantially complies with the statute, although it varies from its\u00a0 language,\u00a0 provided\u00a0 its\u00a0 legal effect is to secure to the appellee\u00a0 all the rights contemplated by\u00a0 the statute requiring the bond.\u00a0\u00a0 (Mejia <i>vs.<\/i> Alimorong, 4\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 572.)\"<\/blockquote>Had the defendant Rosales presented the bond or undertaking to the justice of\u00a0 the peace and if such bond or un- dertaking had been defective, these defects could have been cured in the Court of First Instance, even over the objection of the plaintiff,\u00a0 provided that it had been\u00a0 made to appear to the Court of First Instance that the\u00a0 appeal\u00a0 was taken in good faith\u00a0 and not for delay; but where,\u00a0 as in the case\u00a0 under\u00a0 consideration, no attempt whatever\u00a0 was made to comply with the express provisions of the statute, the Court of First Instance acquired\u00a0 no jurisdiction of the subject\u00a0 matter of the action, except to dismiss the appeal if the appellee, in due time, requested the\u00a0 dismissal. We find no adjudicated case, either in this jurisdiction or in the United States,\u00a0 where the appellate court has\u00a0 been allowed to take\u00a0 and retain jurisdiction where no attempt was made in the justice of the peace court to comply\u00a0 with the statute.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 dismissing\u00a0 of the appeal upon\u00a0 the first motion of the plaintiff\u00a0 is\u00a0 a\u00a0 ministerial act\u00a0 wherein the defendant judge had no discretion.\u00a0 It is well settled that this court; has the power to compel\u00a0 judges of inferior courts to\u00a0 perform purely ministerial acts under positive laws.<br\/><br\/>Therefore,\u00a0 we hereby command the defendant Hon.\u00a0 Dionisio Chanco, or whomsoever may be\u00a0 acting as judge of Ilocos Sur, to immediately\u00a0 dismiss the appeal in question and return the\u00a0 record to the justice\u00a0 of the peace court from whence it\u00a0 came, with instructions\u00a0 to\u00a0 proceed with the execution of the judgment.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Jose\u00a0 Rosales will pay the costs of these proceedings.<br\/><br\/> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Arellano,\u00a0 C.J.,\u00a0 Torres, Johnson<\/span>,  and <i>Moreland,\u00a0 JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Smith, an\u00a0 internal-revenue agent, testified that on the morning of the 3d of February, 1910, he\u00a0 went upstairs into\u00a0 a house in the municipality of Binalonan, in the Province of Pangasinan,\u00a0 and seeing the accused standing there with something in her hand,\u00a0 ordered her\u00a0 to give it to him; that she attempted to conceal it about her person but that he caught her hand\u00a0 and took it from her; that on examination it proved to be a small\u00a0 bottle of opium ash; and that when he asked the accused\u00a0 what she was doing with it, she replied that it was medicine, which she had in her possession because she was sick.<br\/><br\/>The woman, testifying on her own\u00a0 behalf, admitted that the bottle and its contents were found in her\u00a0 possession; but she insisted that she did not know that the bottle contained opium.\u00a0 In\u00a0 explanation\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 fact that she had the bottle in her hand at the moment when the internal-revenue agent\u00a0 entered the house, she stated that\u00a0 a man named Vijunco, the local <i>practicante <\/i>(medical practitioner, without title or\u00a0 special\u00a0 training)\u00a0 had been called in\u00a0 to prescribe for her mother who was very ill; that this man had handed her the bottle and\u00a0 told her to give it to her mother in\u00a0 the manner prescribed\u00a0 by him; that immediately\u00a0 after he had handed her the bottle and received the sum of P4 for his services he stepped to the window and spat on the ground outside, and then hurriedly left the house; that almost at the same time the\u00a0 revenue agent rushed into the house in response (as she believed) to the spit signal\u00a0 from Vijunco, and found the bottle in her hand which she\u00a0 had just received from Vijunco. She further testified that she made no attempt to\u00a0 conceal the bottle, other than the involuntary movement of resistance which she might have made when a strange man suddenly entered her house and attempted to take her property from her by force; and\u00a0 that she did not tell the revenue agent that the medicine was for herself\u00a0 but did say that it was for her mother who was ill at that time.<br\/><br\/>Her testimony was corroborated in every detail\u00a0 by the testimony of various members of her\u00a0 family, who were\u00a0 in the house at the time when the seizure of the\u00a0 opium was made; and it is not contradicted in any of its important details,\u00a0 except by\u00a0 the testimony of\u00a0 Vijunco.\u00a0\u00a0 Called\u00a0 in rebuttal he swore that although it is true that he is a sort of amateur surgeon or <i>practicante<\/i>, he had not prescribed for the sick woman's mother, had not given the bottle in question to the accused, and\u00a0 had not been in\u00a0 the house\u00a0 where the opium was seized on the day of the seizure or at any other time before or since.\u00a0\u00a0 We are satisfied that the testimony of this\u00a0 witness\u00a0 is wholly\u00a0 untrustworthy.\u00a0 His\u00a0 positive oath that he had never been\u00a0 in the house where the seizure was made is in direct conflict with the testimony\u00a0 of Smith, the principal witness for\u00a0 the prosecution, who, on cross-examination, testified that Vijunco had just come out of the house when he entered.\u00a0\u00a0 We think it quite clear that the revenue agent and Vijunco acted in conjunction, Vijunco going into the house first and selling the opium and the agent rushing in and making the arrest\u00a0 as soon\u00a0 as the signal from his confederate informed him that the sale had been made and that the\u00a0 opium had\u00a0 passed into the possession of the purchaser.<br\/><br\/>The apparent\u00a0 contradiction\u00a0 between the\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 of Smith and the witnesses for the\u00a0 accused as to the\u00a0 alleged attempt on the part of the accused to conceal the bottle, and as to the\u00a0 sick person\u00a0 for\u00a0 whose\u00a0 use\u00a0 the contents\u00a0 were intended, may readily be accounted for by the\u00a0 fact that the revenue agent might easily have fallen into\u00a0 error, as to these details, dealing, as\u00a0 he was, with a woman of a different race and habits from his own and the conversation\u00a0 having been conducted in Spanish, a tongue with which both\u00a0 he and the accused were but imperfectly acquainted.<br\/><br\/>That the accused bought the bottle of opium ash and had it in her possession is conclusively proven, but the evidence leaves us in doubt as to whether she did or did not know that the substance purchased by her contained opium.\u00a0 Her account of the incident is reasonable and wholly consistent with her entire innocence of any\u00a0 intent to buy the prohibited drug or to take it into her\u00a0 possession.\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, it\u00a0 is not impossible\u00a0 that Vijunco (who it appears, was himself under charges at the time of the illicit\u00a0 sale of opium)\u00a0 knew that she\u00a0 and her\u00a0 family were\u00a0 users\u00a0 of the drug, laid a trap for her, and made the sale at a time and under such conditions that the revenue agent (with whom he was seeking to ingratiate himself), acting in conjunction with him, would be certain to find it in the possession of the purchaser.\u00a0\u00a0 But giving the accused the benefit of the reasonable\u00a0 doubt, she\u00a0 should be\u00a0 acquitted.\u00a0\u00a0 The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial court should, therefore,\u00a0 be reversed with\u00a0 the costs of both instances <i>de oficio,<\/i> and\u00a0 the accused will\u00a0 be set at liberty forthwith\u00a0 if in detention, or if she is at large on bail, her bondsmen will be exonerated.\u00a0 It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

that they had been there in that locality since very early in\u00a0 the morning engaged in\u00a0 their work; that at the time\u00a0 of the commission of the crime which gave rise to this action, all three were seated within the shadow of said hut, protecting themselves from the intense heat of the sun;

that Antonio Punsalan replied that the water hole\u00a0 and the fish\u00a0 therein\u00a0 belonged to them, whereupon\u00a0 the\u00a0 said Emiliano, saying that he would\u00a0 tell his father, Segundo Ramos, what had been\u00a0 said, went away in search of him, and returned a few minutes later accompanied by his said father, Segundo Ramos, and his brother Luis Ramos;\u00a0 on arriving Segundo Ramos stated\u00a0 to\u00a0 the Punsalans that they must not dry the water hole in question or remove the fish therefrom because he had bought it of one Captain Manuel, who would arrive there on the afternoon of that day; to this Perfecto Punsalan replied, saying that they would continue drying the\u00a0 water hole so that when Captain Manuel arrived he would see it dry; that at this\u00a0 moment\u00a0 the accused Emiliano Ramos, who had\u00a0 taken a position outside of the hut and behind Perfecto Punsalan, struck the latter a blow in the back with his bolo,\u00a0 called a <i>pisao,<\/i> the assaulted being\u00a0 seated on\u00a0 his heels\u00a0 with his back to the accused, unarmed and defenseless; that as the assaulted turned his\u00a0 face toward' his aggressor the\u00a0 latter with his bolo struck him another blow\u00a0 in\u00a0 the face, and he fell to the ground; that\u00a0 Elias Punsalan, seeing his brother attacked, ran to his\u00a0 defense\u00a0 and succeeded in disarming Emiliano Ramos; that while\u00a0 these two\u00a0 were fighting, the other accused, Luis Ramos struck Elias a blow in\u00a0 the head with his bolo; that, while badly injured and considerably dazed,\u00a0 Elias was able to see Segundo\u00a0 Ramos\u00a0 attack his brother Perfecto while he was laying on the ground mortally wounded and strike him a blow with his bolo which penetrated his bowels; and that on seeing this Elias ran forward as best he could and struck\u00a0 Segundo Ramos a blow in the foot to prevent him from injuring his brother further.<br\/><br\/>It further appears that at this time one\u00a0 Sabino\u00a0 de Leon, for the purpose of\u00a0 preventing further fighting among the families, spoke to Segundo Ramos and asked him\u00a0 to\u00a0 cease his attack on the Punsalans; that instead of his suggestion being heeded, the other accused, Luis Ramos, attacked\u00a0 Leon and struck him a blow in the\u00a0 neck with his.bolo, while Segundo Ramos attacked him, wounding him in the hand.<br\/><br\/>As a result\u00a0 of this fight Perfecto Punsalan was\u00a0 mortally wounded, having received five bolo cuts, one in the abdomen, one in the\u00a0 left check, one in the\u00a0 right knee, one in the left shoulder, and the fifth in the palm of the left hand.\u00a0\u00a0 Of these wounds he died a few hours later.\u00a0 Elias Punsalan\u00a0 received nine wounds.\u00a0 Sabino de Leon two wounds.\u00a0 Emiliano Ramos and Segundo Ramos each received\u00a0 slight wounds, the first a slight wound in the forearm,\u00a0 and the second slight wounds in\u00a0 the foot, in the forehead,\u00a0 in a finger,\u00a0 and in an arm.<br\/><br\/>These facts were established by the,testimony of several witnesses.<br\/><br\/>Elias Punsalan testified that on the morning of the 5th of April, 1909, he left his house to go to the Lake of Pinac, in Calaparan, municipality of Calumpit, Province of Bulacan, where he had a well of fish which he had sold to one Morong, of Calumpit, for the sum of P18, and that the <i>comprador<\/i> was to remove the water from the well himself; that while there, and as it was very warm, they took refuge in\u00a0 a little hut or covering; that after a short\u00a0 time there\u00a0 came there Segundo Ramos and his two sons, but that before their arrival and while\u00a0 he was\u00a0 placing stakes preparatory\u00a0 to\u00a0 his work, Emiliano Ramos came and said to him that his father had ordered him to give to the Punsalans notice that they must not remove the water from the well\u00a0 or take the fish therefrom; that the father of the witness\u00a0 replied that the water and the fish belonged to him and that he proposed to do what he pleased with his own property; that thereupon Emiliano said that he would tell his father what had occurred and went in search of him for that purpose; that very soon Emiliano returned with his brother Luis and his father Segundo, and the latter said to the Punsalans that\u00a0 they must not dry the water hole or remove the fish\u00a0 therefrom\u00a0 because\u00a0 Captain Manuel would arrive there in the afternoon; that thereupon Perfecto Punsalan\u00a0 took part in\u00a0 the conversation,\u00a0 saying that he would remove the water and that Captain Manuel when he arrived would see it dry; that thereupon Emiliano Ramos attacked Perfecto with his bolo, striking him in the back, while he was seated on his heels with his back toward Emiliano; that he instantly struck a second\u00a0 blow,\u00a0 hitting Perfecto in the face; that after the second blow Elias\u00a0 Punsalan ran forward and took the bolo from Emiliano,\u00a0 where- upon\u00a0 Luis Ramos struck him a blow\u00a0 in\u00a0 the back, wounding him;\u00a0 that while engaged in fighting\u00a0 with Emiliano he saw Segundo Ramos strike his\u00a0 brother Perfecto\u00a0 several times with his bolo, whereupon he, the witness, went forward and struck Segundo a blow in the foot with the bolo which he had taken from Emiliano; that thereupon Segundo attacked him and struck him\u00a0 several blows; that Sabino de Leon sought to pacify Segundo Ramos and Luis Ramos and by such intervention\u00a0 save\u00a0 the\u00a0 lives of the\u00a0 remainder\u00a0 of the family; that when his\u00a0 brother Perfecto\u00a0 was assaulted by Emiliano he was entirely without arms; that his wounds were such that he required medical attention for two months, during which time he had not been able to\u00a0 go about his usual vocation, and that the\u00a0 wound which he had in the ear was not yet completely\u00a0 cured.<br\/><br\/>Sabino de Leon, who\u00a0 is a\u00a0 brother-in-law of Segundo Ramos, testified that he was near Calaparan\u00a0 the 5th day of April in question, where he had gone to buy fish; that on the way he came up with Francisco de Leon and Fulgencio Bayan and they arrived\u00a0 there\u00a0 together,\u00a0 finding there present Segundo\u00a0 Ramos,\u00a0 Emiliano\u00a0 Ramos,\u00a0 Luis Ramos, Antonio Punsalan, Perfecto Punsalan, Elias Punsalan, and Macario Punsalan; that Segundo Ramos was seated outside\u00a0 of the little hut and that his two sons were on the west side thereof; that the Punsalans were seated within the hut; that when they arrived Elias was\u00a0 talking saying that they had come to dry out the water hole and obtain the fish which they had sold; that Segundo answered that they should not\u00a0 do\u00a0 so because Captain Manuel would come in the afternoon; that Perfecto at this point took part in the conversation, saying that they would dry the\u00a0 water hole and take the fish and if Captain Manuel came in the afternoon he would find it dry; that thereupon Segundo Ramos repeated that they should not remove the fish; that Emiliano, Ramos, who at the time was behind Perfecto\u00a0 Punsalan, arose and\u00a0 attacked\u00a0 the latter, striking him a blow in the back with his bolo; that at the time Perfecto was struck he was\u00a0 seated on the ground with his back toward Emiliano\u00a0 in such a way that he was unable to see Emiliano or what he was trying to do; that the witness was only about 1 yard from Emiliano when\u00a0 he struck Perfecto in the back; that he said nothing whatever to him and gave him no warning of what he was about to do; that Perfecto had no arms and that as he turned his head upon re- ceiving the first blow, he was struck a second blow in the face by Emiliano; that thereupon Perfecto arose and Segundo on seeing him\u00a0 struck him various blows in the face\u00a0 and other parts of the body, while Perfecto defended himself as best he could with a piece of bamboo which he snatched from the floor; that the wound in Perfecto's abdomen was made by Segundo Ramos; that when Elias Punsalan saw Emiliano Ra- mos assault Perfecto he took the bolo away from\u00a0 him;\u00a0 that while thus engaged Luis Ramos attacked Elias, striking him several blows in the\u00a0 head; that as soon as Elias disengaged himself from\u00a0 Emiliano and saw that Segundo Ramos\u00a0 was assaulting his brother Perfecto he ran forward and struck Segundo a blow in the foot with\u00a0 his bolo for the purpose of preventing him doing\u00a0 further injury to his brother; that thereupon the witness approached Segundo Ramos and beseeched him to cease his attack, but Segundo answered him, saying that he was an obstacle in the way of the Ramos family and\u00a0 that\u00a0 they\u00a0 were going\u00a0 to\u00a0 kill him;\u00a0 that\u00a0 at this moment Luis Ramos struck the witness in the neck with his bolo and\u00a0 Segundo Ramos struck him a blow\u00a0 in the hand. This witness further testified that\u00a0 Emiliano\u00a0 inflicted\u00a0 two wounds on Perfecto Punsalan. one in\u00a0 the back and the other in the face, and Segundo Ramos\u00a0 inflicted three wounds, one in the face,\u00a0 one in the hand, and one in the abdomen.\u00a0 He further testified that only one of the Punsalans, Elias,\u00a0 had a bolo, but that bolo was not taken from its sheath\u00a0 during the fight.<br\/><br\/>To the same effect testified Francisco de Leon and Perfecto Punsalan, who made\u00a0 a statement\u00a0 of the facts of the crime a few minutes before his death.<br\/><br\/>The accused in\u00a0 their testimony presented a different history of the case.\u00a0 They sought to demonstrate that they were the ones who were attacked and that whatever they did was done in\u00a0 self-defense.\u00a0 Their testimony,\u00a0 however, is entirely destroyed\u00a0 by the\u00a0 testimony of the witnesses already mentioned and the testimony of Fulgencio Bayan, who was also present\u00a0 at the time and who saw the whole occurrence.<br\/><br\/>The learned trial court found the facts to be substantially as stated by the witnesses for the prosecution and accordingly convicted the defendants of the crime of murder.\u00a0\u00a0 We have carefully examined the testimony in the case and are of the opinion that the evidence fully supports the judgment of the court.<br\/><br\/>Aside from the questions of fact raised by the appellants, they assert that\u00a0 the two accused,\u00a0 Luis Ramos and Segundo Ramos,\u00a0 are not\u00a0 .principals\u00a0 in\u00a0 the crime.\u00a0 Under the\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Penal Code, however,\u00a0 not only\u00a0 those\u00a0 are authors who cooperate in the execution of the act by another act, without which it would not have been accomplished, but also those who take direct part in the execution of the act itself.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 13, Penal Code; U. S.\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i> Raymundo, 14 Phil. Rep., 416; supreme court of Spain, 22 April, 1878; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Supila, 13 Phil. Rep., 671; supreme court of Spain, 11\u00a0 October, 1883.)\u00a0\u00a0 It is undoubted that the defendants\u00a0 in this case all took direct part in the execution of the acts by which Perfecto Punsalan met his death.<br\/><br\/>The appellants also assert that\u00a0 Luis Ramos and Segundo Ramos ought not to be convicted of the crime of murder, inasmuch as they took no part in the act of Emiliano Ramos when he treacherously struck Perfecto Punsalan in the back, this being the act which qualified\u00a0 the crime as murder.\u00a0 It appears from the evidence, however, that after Emiliano had struck Perfecto the blow which stretched him helpless on the ground, the accused Segundo Ramos then attacked him and inflicted upon him various other wounds, among them being a frightful wound in the abdomen, which was one of\u00a0 the moving\u00a0 causes of his death.\u00a0 While\u00a0 Segundo\u00a0 was thus wounding Perfecto, Luis Ramos was preventing Elias Punsalan from protecting his\u00a0 brother\u00a0 Perfecto against\u00a0 the attacks of Segundo.\u00a0\u00a0 They thereby, as we have said before, became\u00a0 principals in the crime,\u00a0 whatever it was.\u00a0 If\u00a0 the crime chanced to be homicide, they were principals in it.\u00a0\u00a0 If it chanced to be murder, they were principals in that crime also.\u00a0 They were there present when the attack was made by Emiliano, saw the manner\u00a0 in\u00a0 which he attacked\u00a0 Perfecto and, taking advantage of that attack and the injury which it inflicted upon Perfecto, they attacked Perfecto and Elias with their weapons.\u00a0 While it is true that Luis and Segundo took no actual part in the blow delivered by Emiliano, they, nevertheless,\u00a0 sanctioned that blow\u00a0 and took\u00a0 advantage of its results.\u00a0 There can be no doubt about the legal necessity of imputing to\u00a0 them the same\u00a0 <i>alevosia <\/i>which was present in the act of Emiliano.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the judgment of conviction\u00a0 is affirmed.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

then it was abandoned, in which condition, and with permission from competent authority first had, it was\u00a0 cleared, cultivated and\u00a0 occupied by the defendant continuously for many years to date.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The first part\u00a0 of this finding is in accordance with the evidence and must therefore be sustained, for it is satisfactorily proven, from the composition title presented by the plaintiff, that he obtained from the State on July 26, 1898, a grant of ownership of the land which is the\u00a0 subject of the complaint,\u00a0 along\u00a0 with several other parcels\u00a0 described in said title.<\/p><p>But it\u00a0 is incorrect that the plaintiff has abandoned said land,\u00a0 as averred in the final part\u00a0 of the above findings in the judgment appealed from; and\u00a0 still more incorrect if it is intended to\u00a0 signify\u00a0 thereby, as\u00a0 appears, that\u00a0 he has renounced his ownership of said land.\u00a0 There is no proof of such abandonment.\u00a0 According to the lower court,\u00a0 \"a proof of this is the fact stated in the complaint that the defendant has held the\u00a0 land since 1898 and ceased to pay rent in 1901.\u00a0\u00a0 If the land (it adds) had not been abandoned; by him who considers himself its owner, how is it that he. ceased to derive benefit from\u00a0 it and only claimed\u00a0 it after nine years?\"\u00a0\u00a0 It is proven by the testimony of three witnesses that the plaintiff let the land in question out on; shares to the defendant in the year 1898, and that in said year and the\u00a0 two succeeding ones he\u00a0 received from the defendant half of the crop therefrom, which was\u00a0 the condition of the tenancy on shares; but the defendant has failed to fulfill this condition since the year 1901.<\/p><p>There is no definite record as to what extrajudicial action the plaintiff has taken to recover possession of the\u00a0 land off to secure the half of the crop that he should receive as owners before concluding to institute the present suit for recovery in 1909; but it is certain that he performed no act which might signify his\u00a0 intention or purpose of abandoning said parcel of land, as indicated in the judgment appealed from,: for such can not be inferred from the fact that he has filed no judicial claim during nine years for the nonfulfillment by his tenant, the defendant herein, of the contract of tenancy on shares.\u00a0 This\u00a0 fact\u00a0 may\u00a0 impute to\u00a0 him\u00a0 more\u00a0 or less serious negligence in looking out for his interests; but in no way can it be construed as a renunciation, even by implication,\u00a0 of his right of ownership; and much less can it fe6 regarded as legal ground for depriving him of such right; not even lost\u00a0 by prescription,\u00a0 which was not averred, as sufficient time has not elapsed for this to take place according to law.<\/p><p>The statement in the judgment appealed\u00a0 from that the defendant, as\u00a0 a result of the alleged abandonment by the plaintiff, cleared,\u00a0 cultivated\u00a0 and\u00a0 has\u00a0 been occupying land in question for many\u00a0 years\u00a0 continuously to date permission of\u00a0 competent authority\u00a0 first had, is not supported in\u00a0 any way by the evidence in the case.\u00a0 The permission referred to in that part of the sentence is a written authorization issued by the <em>gobernadorcillo <\/em>of the town of Dolores, Abra, Ilocos Sur, to the defendant herein and other individuals to transplant\u00a0 rice to some fields which were said to be abandoned in the sitios called Daquigan, Caguang, Putu,\u00a0 Panday, Sungol, Lassaogan, Rubica, and Abar.\u00a0 But this authorization is dated April 10, 1885, while the composition title whereby the defendant obtained from the State ownership of the land in question was\u00a0 issued only on July 26,\u00a0 1898.\u00a0 This\u00a0 being true, if the plaintiff had not yet obtained ownership of the said land in\u00a0 1885, it is\u00a0 evident that there is no room for supposing that he had then abandoned\u00a0 it and that as a consequence of his abandonment the defendant\u00a0 began\u00a0 to occupy and cultivate it in said\u00a0 year, 1885, for the simple reason that one can not abandon what he does not possess.\u00a0 The authorization of the <em>gobernadorcillo<\/em> of Dolores hardly refers to the land in\u00a0 litigation, for no\u00a0 mention\u00a0 whatsoever is made\u00a0 therein of the\u00a0 <em>sitio<\/em> of Oangoang, where this land is situated.\u00a0 And\u00a0 if it did refer to this same land, then it was effectively annulled and cancelled\u00a0 by the grant made later to the plaintiff by the\u00a0 State through the composition title of 1898 which has been mentioned; every one knows that only\u00a0 the State\u00a0 can\u00a0 convey ownership of public land to private parties.<\/p><p>In the absence of adequate evidence showing the quantity of products the defendant has\u00a0 secured\u00a0 from the\u00a0 land in question during the years that have elapsed since 1901, there is no basis for computing the half\u00a0 the plaintiff should receive according to the alleged contract of tenancy\u00a0 on shares, so no finding can be made on this point. The\u00a0 judgment appealed from is hereby reversed and the defendant ordered to restore to the\u00a0 plaintiff the parcel of land which is the subject of the complaint, with the\u00a0 costs in first instance against the said defendant, and no\u00a0 special findings as to the costs in\u00a0 this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson<\/em>, and <em>Moreland, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

The costs were assessed against the plaintiff and the intervener equally.\u00a0 Exception was taken to this judgment by the counsel for the plaintiff and the intervener,, respectively, who by\u00a0 written motion\u00a0 asked for the annulment of the judgment\u00a0 and a new trial,\u00a0 and the court, after\u00a0 ruling upon the incident raised in\u00a0 connection with the appearance\u00a0 of attorney Bonoan in place of attorney P. Soriano, overruled the motions made for a new trial.\u00a0 From these rulings, the appellants took exception and presented, separately, the required\u00a0 bills of exceptions, which were certified, approved, and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The action for the recovery of possession, brought in this case\u00a0 by Marcelo de la Cruz,\u00a0 is founded on the public instrument of acquisition of the lands specified in the complaint under letters Z, AA, and\u00a0 BB, of June 8, 1888, and on the possessory information title applied for by him and approved on September 10, 1894, with a note of inscription in\u00a0 the\u00a0 property\u00a0 registry, of\u00a0 the date of March 15, 1894, with\u00a0 respect to the lands specified in the said complaint, excepting the three parcels situated\u00a0 in Bacud, designated under the letters A, B, and C, and whose acquisition is not recorded in the aforementioned instruments.<br\/><br\/>The defendants' counsel, denying the claim made by the plaintiff in the capacity of sole owner of the lands, the exclusive ownership of which he claims, alleged that the defendants Nemesio and Eulalio Vicente and\u00a0 the\u00a0 wife of Nicolas Nino then owned one-half of the lands which were the subject of the complaint, as the children and successors of the deceased Feliciano Vicente; that the latter, during his lifetime, and\u00a0 the plaintiff, Marcelo de la Cruz,\u00a0 entered into partnership\u00a0 for the\u00a0 purpose of\u00a0 acquiring in common the lands in question,\u00a0 by purchase, and that\u00a0 they did so acquire the same in 1888 and held and enjoyed the said property pro indiviso,\u00a0 with equal rights; that, by common accord,\u00a0 the documents of title were drawn up in the name of De la Cruz\u00a0 only, although the\u00a0 expenses connected therewith\u00a0 were charged against them both; and that later, on March 18, 1897, they proceeded, likewise by common accord and in harmony, to divide by halves the said lands of common ownership, a partition which was recorded in the instrument\u00a0 marked \"Exhibit\u00a0 C,\" written in\u00a0 Ilocano and translated further onf\u00a0 on folios 51 and 53 of the record.<br\/><br\/>It appears that this\u00a0 instrument was recognized as true and authentic by Marcelo de la Cruz in his sworn testimony at the hearing of the case (p. 6 of the record)\u00a0 and therefore,\u00a0 notwithstanding the fact that the aforementioned instrument and possessory information title are found to have been drawn\u00a0 up in\u00a0 his name, it is unquestionable that\u00a0 the ownership of the lands in litigation\u00a0 pertains to the two partners to whom\u00a0 the said instrument,\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 C, refers, and that the defendants, as the heirs of the deceased partner, Feliciano Vicente, the co-owner of the said lands, are today the\u00a0 legitimate\u00a0 proprietors of one-half of the same in\u00a0 the manner in which, pursuant to the agreement had between the\u00a0 partners, the coowners, the properties were\u00a0 divided equally, according to the said instrument, Exhibit C.<br\/><blockquote>\"A private instrument\u00a0 legally acknowledged shall\u00a0 have, with regard\u00a0 to those who\u00a0 signed it and their legal representatives,\u00a0 the same force as a public instrument.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 1225, Civil Code.)<\/blockquote><br\/>On this provision is based the doctrine established by\u00a0 the supreme court\u00a0 of Spain in\u00a0 its decisions of November\u00a0 19, 1891, and February 18, 1898.<br\/><br\/>The record does not show that the said instrument, Exhibit C, was impugned or assailed as false; on the contrary, it was acknowledged by Marcelo de la\u00a0 Cruz, one of the two\u00a0 contracting parties, who, moreover,\u00a0 stated in his said sworn testimony that the lands in question were acquired with money belonging to himself and to Feliciano Vicente; it must of necessity be recognized as an incontrovertible fact, perfectly\u00a0 proved,\u00a0 that\u00a0 the said lands were purchased by Marcelo de la Cruz\u00a0 and Feliciano Vicente, although the instruments of\u00a0 title pertaining to the lands acquired by the two\u00a0 partners were\u00a0 drawn\u00a0 up in the name\u00a0 of but one of them, Marcelo\u00a0 de la Cruz;\u00a0 and further, that, years\u00a0 after these properties had been held in common\u00a0 by them as\u00a0 co-owners, they\u00a0 agreed to divide them in equal parts as they did,\u00a0 which particulars\u00a0 were set forth in the said\u00a0 instrument, Exhibit C, signed by the two partners and the witness Feliciano or Luciano Villanueva who, together with another witness, Gaspar Fermin, confirmed the facts related; the third witness, Eduardo Fontanilla, stated that the lands in Cadalayapan, Caandongan, and\u00a0 Polonday were originally held by his father,\u00a0 Julio Fontanilla,\u00a0 who sold them to the now deceased Feliciano Vicente, and that the latter's heirs, the defendants, hold them at the\u00a0 present time.<br\/><br\/>The mortgage referred to by the plaintiff in\u00a0 his sworn testimony\u00a0 as having\u00a0 been made in favor of Feliciano Vicente, as security for a certain amount of money, does not appear\u00a0 to\u00a0 have been recorded in the oft-mentioned instrument, Exhibit\u00a0 C, but in the one exhibited by the\u00a0 plaintiff as Exhibit F,\u00a0 and although\u00a0 it is not shown that it was authenticated by the\u00a0 party who\u00a0 executed it, Feliciano Vicente, now deceased,\u00a0 yet it\u00a0 was\u00a0 authenticated by three witnesses who affixed their\u00a0 signatures thereto;\u00a0 moreover, the instrument was exhibited by the plaintiff himself.<br\/><br\/>In the aforesaid instrument, Exhibit F, Feliciano Vicente stated he had received from Marcelo de la Cruz, the plaintiff, the sum of P208, the amount\u00a0 for which certain lands named therein, belonging to the debtor and situated in the places specified, had been mortgaged to the said De\u00a0 la Cruz. From the\u00a0 context of this instrument, it is\u00a0 deduced\u00a0 that the plaintiff, De la Cruz, came to owe\u00a0 Feliciano Vicente, the father\u00a0 of the defendants, a certain sum\u00a0 of money and that,\u00a0 as\u00a0 security for\u00a0 its payment, lands\u00a0 belonging to\u00a0 the debtor were mortgaged,\u00a0 which probably were not all those recorded in the instrument and possessory information title exhibited by the said\u00a0 plaintiff as\u00a0 Exhibits\u00a0 A and B,\u00a0 but the half of those properties\u00a0 divided equally\u00a0 between their two co-owners.\u00a0\u00a0 How and in what manner the debt was contracted\u00a0 is immaterial for the proper determination of this litigation, for whether it were\u00a0 a loan to the plaintiff, or whether the sum recorded\u00a0 in the instrument marked as Exhibit F were one-half of the total value of\u00a0 the lands purchased by the partners and which the plaintiff, De la Cruz, could\u00a0 not\u00a0 immediately pay to his co-partner, Vicente, as stated in his testimony by the said witness Gaspar Fermin, the said plaintiff is beyond all doubt the sole\u00a0 owner of one- half of the lands in question, the half\u00a0 which he holds, and that he is not entitled to\u00a0 claim the other half\u00a0 which\u00a0 belongs exclusively to the defendants as the unquestionable successors of the co-partner, Feliciano Vicente, notwithstanding the instruments, Exhibits A and B.\u00a0 Neither is it credible, nor probable, that the said defendants usurped precisely one- half of the lands in dispute, and if they are in possession of the same at the present time, it\u00a0 is fully proved that they occupy them under the title of ownership.<br\/><br\/>With\u00a0 respect to the action brought\u00a0 by the intervener, Santos Jarapan, and which is also\u00a0 of the nature of one for the\u00a0 recovery of possession, the ownership which he claims with respect to the lands in question is not\u00a0 shown in the record to have been\u00a0 proved\u00a0 by the documents which\u00a0 he exhibited, for\u00a0 according to the\u00a0 invariable rulings\u00a0 of the courts, in order that an action for the recovery of possession may prosper, it\u00a0 is indispensable that he who brings it fully prove not only his ownership, but also the identity of the thing claimed.<br\/><br\/>The intervener Jarapan did not prove, as\u00a0 stated in the judgment appealed from, that the said instruments, Exhibits E and F, which contain no exact descriptions of the respective situation, area, and boundaries\u00a0 of the properties therein mentioned,\u00a0 refer\u00a0 to the\u00a0 lands now\u00a0 held\u00a0 by the plaintiff and\u00a0 the defendants;\u00a0 wherefore, by such documents,\u00a0 the intervened ownership and the identity of the said lands can\u00a0 not be deemed to be established, and with all the more reason since the record shows it to\u00a0 have been\u00a0 satisfactorily proved that the said plaintiff and defendants are the owners, respectively, by halves, of the lands in litigation; and hence the aforesaid third party, who failed to establish his better right, can not be considered as owner.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors attributed by the appellants to the judgment appealed from are deemed to have been decided, it is proper, in our opinion, to affirm the said\u00a0 judgment, as we\u00a0 hereby do, with one-half\u00a0 of the costs of\u00a0 this instance\u00a0 against each of the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

Linton and Nina Linton were sleeping, with the intent treacherously to kill them and did in fact stab the\u00a0 said two persons while they were sound asleep,\u00a0 inflicting upon Walter P. Linton a wound in\u00a0 the upper part of the\u00a0 armpit of the left side, and upon Nina Linton a wound in the left arm, piercing through the same to the inner side thereof,\u00a0 and, another superficial wound in her left side; but their respective wounds did not produce death and were cured after more than thirty days' medical attendance, the two said parties being\u00a0 obliged to refrain from engaging in their customary labors during the time they were under treatment.\"<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li> The crime,\u00a0 the circumstances attending its perpetration, and the\u00a0 liability of the\u00a0 accused as the sole author having been satisfactorily proven, the latter was sentenced under article\u00a0 403, in connection\u00a0 with article 3, paragraph 2, of the Penal Code, to seventeen years and four months of <em>cadena temporal<\/em>, to the accessories,\u00a0 to indemnify the offended parties in the sum of P324, and to pay the costs. From this judgment the defendant appealed.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>The learned counsel for the defense only asks in this instance that,\u00a0 with\u00a0 a reversal of\u00a0 the judgment\u00a0 appealed from, the crime\u00a0 under prosecution be declared to be one of <em>lesiones menos graves<\/em>, and that the penalty imposed be reduced;\u00a0 he alleges, as the only error\u00a0 committed by the trial court, that the latter, notwithstanding\u00a0 the evidence adduced, sentenced the defendant for the crime of frustrated murder,\u00a0 instead of for that of <em>lesiones menos graves.<\/em><br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>Mrs. Linton's wound according to the\u00a0 expert medical examination made, extended from one side of the left arm to the other and reached the left side of\u00a0 her body.\u00a0\u00a0 The trial judge, considering its gravity, said\u00a0 that the blow had been so violent that\u00a0 if, instead of the weapon piercing the left arm, it had been driven directly into the left side,\u00a0 it would have embedded itselt up to the hilt and pierced the heart.\u00a0 Mr. Linton's wound, also according\u00a0 to expert medical\u00a0 examination, was in the\u00a0 left\u00a0 side of the\u00a0 breast,\u00a0 3 decimeters deep and exposed the patient to the danger of death, until the hemorrhage had been stopped.\u00a0 The weapon with which the accused inflicted\u00a0 such wounds is described in the judgment as a sharp-pointed bolo\u00a0 with a well-sharpened blade 10\u00a0 inches in length and, according to Mrs. Linton's testimony, was clean and bright on the night of the crime - it was a dagger rather than a bolo, in the opinion of the judge.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant,\u00a0 until two days prior to the crime, had been a servant in the house where it was committed and, on the very day of the crime, insistently sought to return to the service of the offended parties, but was not admitted by the lady of the\u00a0 house, one of the complaining witnesses.\u00a0 According to her testimony,\u00a0 Sanchez was acquainted with all the rooms and other parts\u00a0 of the house and it was he who used to make the bed when\u00a0 he was in the service of the Lintons.\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of committing the crime, the defendant entered the house by means of a ladder through one of the windows of the sleeping room, and the first person he\u00a0 assaulted was Mrs. Linton who was lying in\u00a0 the bed on the side next to the window.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>With respect to the classification of the crime and to the punishment of the guilty party, the trial court took account\u00a0 of the qualifying\u00a0 circumstance of treachery and, as aggravating generic circumstances, those of\u00a0 escalamiento and entry into the offended parties' own dwelling.\u00a0 By reason of the treacherous attempt to kill two persons, the crime was classified as frustrated double murder. The judgment relates that the defendant took advantage of the silence and darkness of the night, cautiously entered the\u00a0 room where his victims were sleeping, approached the bed\u00a0 and, finding them sound asleep and knowing that he was perfectly safe and was\u00a0 in no risk of danger\u00a0 to himself such as might have arisen had the Linton spouses made any defense, struck Mrs. Linton with a dagger, and then Mr, Linton, and took to flight.<\/li><\/ol>In a case where it appeared that the accused,\u00a0 without saying a\u00a0 word, had stabbed the offended party with a dagger, in the middle of the right side of the back about four centimeters from the spinal column, and immediately thereupon fled, the wound not\u00a0 producing death nor disability for work and requiring ninety days for its cure, and the weapon used in inflicting the wound being a prohibited\u00a0 one, the insular supreme court classified the\u00a0 crime as frustrated homicide; but the supreme court of Spain held that the acts constituted the crime of frustrated murder, on account of the attendance of the specific circumstance of treachery, since\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused assaulted his victim in an unexpected manner at a moment when the latter was\u00a0 seated on the counter of the store, with his back to the entrance door and to his aggressor, and was looking toward the interior of the establishment, which situation was taken advantage of by the accused to wound the offended party without being seen by him.\u00a0 All these facts show treachery.\u00a0 (Decision of April\u00a0 17, 1895.)<p>In another case where the aggressor struck his victim a blow from behind with a sharp weapon, cutting him in the middle part of the inner edge of the left shoulder blade, and then started to run; but seeing himself pursued by the injured man, turned about and approaching him to within a step struck another blow at the injured party, directed at his abdomen,\u00a0 which the latter was able to avoid by giving a jump that caused him to slip and fall to the ground, and his assailant,\u00a0 seeing that he\u00a0 had fallen, threw\u00a0 the weapon at him, without hitting him, and again started to run - both the insular supreme court and the supreme court of Spain classified the crime as frustrated murder; the latter court held, in accordance with the facts found to have been proven in the judgment appealed from, that the accused performed all the acts which might have\u00a0 resulted in depriving the assaulted of his life, and that the trial court,\u00a0 in classifying the crime as one of frustrated murder, did not commit any error of law.\u00a0\u00a0 (Decision of September\u00a0 29, 1881.)<\/p><p>And, finally, in another case - where an old man who was walking along the street was wounded in the back by a knife of a\u00a0 kind whose\u00a0 use\u00a0 was prohibited, the\u00a0 weapon remaining fastened in the bone of the right upper scapular region and causing a wound that was cured in seven days, a wound which might have been fatal if the knife had penetrated\u00a0 through the upper part of the scapula or if the impulse of the blow\u00a0 had\u00a0 been stronger - the insular supreme court, considering\u00a0 that the perpetrator of the deed laid in wait for his victim in\u00a0 order to derive advantage from the most favorable moment, to the end that the latter might not be able to rely upon any help in his defense,\u00a0 and that the assailant, after striking: the blow from behind, took to flight, classified the crime as frustrated murder, and the supreme court of Spain said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"That the attempt perpetrated was properly classified as a crime of frustrated\u00a0 murder,\u00a0 because, from the proven facts related in the judgment appealed\u00a0 from, the known, determined and premeditated intent of\u00a0 the guilty parties was to kill the person assaulted,\u00a0 and such intent being premised, the classification of the crime can\u00a0 not be\u00a0 made in accordance with the mere\u00a0 result produced by the violent act; as there were attendant in its commission the circumstances of treachery, premeditation and price, any one of which is sufficient for the aforesaid classification of the crime of the attempted killing, the trial court did not incur any of the errors\u00a0 alleged.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Decision of supreme court of Spain, Dec. 31,\u00a0 1890.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The particular part of the body of a person struck during an assault, the deadly character of the,weapon\u00a0 used and the violence\u00a0 of the\u00a0 attack,\u00a0 taken together,\u00a0 do not constitute proof of an intention to\u00a0 kill when they are all\u00a0 incidental to a quarrel in which the contending parties come to blows; under such circumstances, the actual conditions, surrounding the encounter form the best criterion by which to arrive at the facts; but when all the said circumstances are\u00a0 present, and the crime further involves acts committed with alevosia, in such manner as\u00a0 to\u00a0 insure the safety of the assailant while depriving\u00a0 the\u00a0 victim of the opportunity\u00a0 to make defense, and when the aggressor,\u00a0 having\u00a0 special knowledge of the place of the assault, surprises and attacks his victim while the latter is asleep, and is then able to escape because of his intimate acquaintance with the interior of the house, in which he\u00a0 was formerly employed as\u00a0 a servant, the intention to kill clearly appears and\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime is\u00a0 properly classified as frustrated murder. Therefore, the crime\u00a0 under prosecution is properly classified as\u00a0 frustrated double murder, and the judgment\u00a0 so holding and applying to the defendant the penalty corresponding to the crime of frustrated murder attended by the two aforesaid aggravating circumstances, is in accordance with the\u00a0 law, and is affirmed,\u00a0 with the costs against the appellant.<\/p><p><em>Torres,\u00a0 Mapa, Johnson,\u00a0 Carson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

Under the provisions of section 497 of the Code of Civil Procedure he was, therefore, entitled to have the Supreme Court review the facts.<br\/><br\/>On pages 6 and 7 of\u00a0 the bill of exceptions appear these words:<br\/><blockquote>\"On the trial both parties presented proofs, the plaintiff's consisting of Exhibits A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, and the defendant's of Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, besides oral evidence introduced by both parties, as appears in the stenographer's notes; which Baid\u00a0 proofs, together\u00a0 with said exhibits, are made an integral part of this bill of exceptions.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In spite of this\u00a0 statement,\u00a0 the oral\u00a0 evidence has not been transmitted to this court.\u00a0 In explanation of his failure to transmit the oral\u00a0 evidence, the clerk\u00a0 of the Court of First Instance says, page 1 of the <i>rollo<\/i>:<br\/><blockquote>\"I am unable\u00a0 to accompany the bill of exceptions with a copy of the oral\u00a0 testimony fbr the reason that the excepting party has failed to obtain and present\u00a0 it for transmission, in spite of repeated demands\u00a0 made upon him to do so.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Through the negligence of the appellant we have before us, then, only\u00a0 a\u00a0 portion\u00a0 of the evidence taken, namely, the exhibits.\u00a0 Under such conditions\u00a0 it has been the practice of this court, under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, to disregard that portion of the evidence transmitted and to look only at the pleadings and\u00a0 the facts presented in the opinion of the trial court for the\u00a0 facts\u00a0 of the case and, if they support his conclusions of law,\u00a0 to\u00a0 affirm the judgment.\u00a0 We are,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 of the opinion\u00a0 that, under the particular circumstances to this case, as presented by that portion of the evidence in the form of the exhibits found in the record on\u00a0 appeal, which\u00a0 appear to have been regularly admitted in evidence, that, unless the oral proofs put upon the case a different aspect, the judgment, if not set aside altogether, ought to\u00a0 be very\u00a0 materially reduced\u00a0 in amount; and a decision based wholly upon the pleadings and the facts of the opinion might result in a grave injustice. While we can not permit the appellant to take any advantage of his own negligence, and although we can not look at said exhibits for the purpose of finally deciding this case, we feel that, in the interests of justice, the record ought to be completed by having made a part thereof the oral testimony adduced on the trial.\u00a0 This being so, the court exercises its discretionary powers in order to give the appellant an opportunity to explain his failure to bring all the evidence before us, and in the event that he can\u00a0 offer a satisfactory explanation, to give him an opportunity to complete the record.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the learned trial court is hereby affirmed upon the pleadings and upon the facts set out in its opinion, without special finding as to costs, unless the appellant, forthwith, upon\u00a0 the receipt of notice of this\u00a0 decision, submits a satisfactory explanation of his failure to bring to this court all\u00a0 the evidence submitted in the\u00a0 court below, and unless, as soon as\u00a0 practicable thereafter, and at all\u00a0 events within sixty days\u00a0 after receipt of said notice\u00a0 he files a properly certified typewritten\u00a0 copy\u00a0 of all\u00a0 the evidence submitted at the trial in\u00a0 this case not already made a\u00a0 part of the record, or show cause why\u00a0 he does\u00a0 not do so; in\u00a0 default whereof,\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment of\u00a0 the trial court will thereafter stand affirmed as aforesaid.\u00a0 But;, without further order of the court, judgment will not be entered in accordance herewith until sixty days after the appellant has received notice of this decision.\u00a0 Ten\u00a0 days after judgment has been entered let the record be returned to the court whence it came for execution.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C, J.,\u00a0 Mapa, Carson, <\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ., <\/i> concur.<br\/><\/div>",

and F.\u00a0 The court, therefore, on the 30th\u00a0 of the same month, issued\u00a0 an order dismissing the application\u00a0 for the registration of the property.\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the applicants, on being notified of\u00a0 this action,\u00a0 entered an exception, announced his\u00a0 intention to file a bill\u00a0 of exceptions, and at the same time, moved for a rehearing of the case, on the grounds that the preceding rulings of the court were openly and manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence and contrary to law.\u00a0 The motion for a rehearing was\u00a0 overruled by an order\u00a0 of September 8, 1909; exception was\u00a0 taken by the applicants'\u00a0 attorney, who afterwards\u00a0 in due season filed the\u00a0 required bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>This case deals with the inscription by the Court of Land Registration\u00a0 of a large track of agricultural land situated in the pueblos of Paz and Tarlac, Province of Tarlac, which property consists of\u00a0 eleven parcels specified\u00a0 in detail in the plan Exhibit F.\u00a0\u00a0 This plan was presented subsequent to the presentation of\u00a0 Exhibits A and B, for the reason that in these latter the said eleven parcels of land are not numbered.<br\/><br\/>We shall first take up the question of seven of the eleven parcels that form the total area of the land sought to be registered, inasmuch as these seven\u00a0 parcels of land were legitimately acquired by the predecessors of the applicants, according to the documents exhibited to prove such acquisition, which are Exhibits Y, R,\u00a0 LL, L, M, I, and E, and relate to the parcels designated in the plan Exhibit F, under the numbers 2, 4, 7, 8, 9,10, and 11.<br\/><br\/>The documents just above mentioned, exhibited by the applicants' counsel, furnish proof as to the manner\u00a0 in which those seven parcels of land were acquired by their respective original owners, the predecessors\u00a0 of the\u00a0 applicants. Six of these documents\u00a0 are of\u00a0 a public character, as are the deeds of sale executed\u00a0 by the administration on behalf of the State, and the seventh document is a title of ownership by\u00a0 composition\u00a0 with the State, likewise executed by\u00a0 the administration\u00a0 during\u00a0 the preceding regime.\u00a0\u00a0 None\u00a0 of these instruments were challenged or impugned\u00a0 as\u00a0 being false, either civilly or criminally, by any of\u00a0 the opponents and no evidence was\u00a0 offered\u00a0 tending to invalidate them.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from recognizes the\u00a0 validity of the titles exhibited by the applicants to prove their ownership of the said seven parcels of\u00a0 land,\u00a0 designated under numbers 2, 4, 7, 8,\u00a0 9, 10, and 11, and also recognizes\u00a0 the correctness\u00a0 of the respective\u00a0 areas set out in each one of their titles of acquisition; but the court was unable to decree the registration of these\u00a0 seven parcels of land for the reason that the total sum of their areas as aet forth in\u00a0 the applicants' respective titles only amounts to 403\u00a0 hectares, 99 ares, and 8 centares, which is much less than half of the aggregate areas specified in the amended application.\u00a0\u00a0 According\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 plans\u00a0 presented by the\u00a0 applicants under letters A, B and F,\u00a0 these amount to 870 hectares, 18 ares, and 74 [73] centares.\u00a0 There is consequently a difference of 466 hectares, 19 ares, and 65 centares.<br\/><br\/>Even though there be added to the sum of the areas of the said seven parcels of land, of 403 hectares, 99 ares, and 8 centares, the area of four other parcels of land designated in the plan Exhibit F, under the numbers 1, 3, 5, and 6, and with respect to which\u00a0 neither the\u00a0 applicants nor\u00a0 any of their predecessors obtained\u00a0 any title whatever from the State, and which four parcels contain 269 hectares\u00a0 and 26 ares, there would be a total of but 674 hectares, 25 ares, and 8 centares; which compared with that of\u00a0 870 hectares, 18 ares, and 73 centares, the area mentioned in the application and plans presented as\u00a0 shown by the\u00a0 record, there is seen that there would still be a difference of 195 hectares, 93 ares, and 65 centares.<br\/><br\/>However, even granting that there was but little accuracy in the measurements of the lands in litigation recorded in their titles, and that the public administrative officers during the previous sovereignty officially allowed,\u00a0 as a tolerable error, 5 per cent of the excess so that when it exceeded this amount and was less than 15 per cent the\u00a0 purchaser was entitled to the \"composition\" of the\u00a0 surplus on payment of its price\u00a0 determined by appraisal, 'nevertheless it is necessary that the plan be amended to conform with the respective titles of the said seven parcels of land, so that it may appear with certainty whether there was an excess through error and what area of land such excess comprises, for the purpose of ascertaining the rights of the applicants, in their relation to the State and to interested third parties. Valeriana Calivara, the immediate predecessor in interest of the applicants and the principal witness in this case, and the others\u00a0 who testified in support of the former's claim, were unable exactly to determine the situation and\u00a0 boundaries of each one\u00a0 of the said seven parcels of land specified in the\u00a0 plan, Exhibit F, numbered 2, 4, 7, 8,\u00a0 9, 10 and 11,\u00a0 or to explain how the surveyor who examined and surveyed the lands in question succeeded in determining and identifying each\u00a0 parcel\u00a0 in\u00a0 accordance with\u00a0 the\u00a0 location, area and boundaries recorded in their respective titles, which titles, as the said Calivara testified, were taken into account by the surveyor in his operations and in making the plan; for, from the oral and documentary evidence of record in the case, it is found that the location, area, and boundaries of the lands\u00a0 described in the titles exhibited by the counsel for the\u00a0 applicants do not exactly coincide with the\u00a0 plans presented, and, consequently, the identity of each of\u00a0 those seven parcels of land was not proved, as is required to have been done by the\u00a0 applicants in order that\u00a0 the same might be registered in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>Article\u00a0 9\u00a0 of the old Mortgage Law in force\u00a0 in\u00a0 these Islands,\u00a0 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every\u00a0 record\u00a0 made in the registry shall contain the following details:<br\/><br\/>\"1. The nature, location, and bounds of the\u00a0 realty which is the subject of record, or which is affected by the interest which is to be recorded, its superficial area measured according to the standard used\u00a0 in the country, and its equivalent in the metrical system, and its name and number, if they appear in the deed.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Article 63 of the General\u00a0 Regulations for\u00a0 the\u00a0 enforcement of the said law, prescribes:<br\/><blockquote>\"To indicate\u00a0 exactly\u00a0 the estates or\u00a0 rights which\u00a0 are the subject matter of the records, Registrars shall act in accordance with the provisions contained in\u00a0 article 9 of the\u00a0 Law, subject\u00a0 to the\u00a0 following rules:<br\/><br\/>\"First. The\u00a0 character\u00a0 of the\u00a0 estate shall be\u00a0 described, stating whether it is rural or city, and the\u00a0 name by which such estates are known in the province or\u00a0 town.<br\/><br\/>\"Second. The location of the rural estates shall\u00a0 be\u00a0 fixed by a statement of the district,\u00a0 subdistrict, or any other name by which the place in which they are located is known, their boundaries according to the four cardinal points, the character of the contiguous estate, and any details which will avoid\u00a0 its being confounded with others.<br\/><br\/><br\/>\"Third.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"Fourth. The superficial area shall be stated in the manner in which it\u00a0 appears in\u00a0 the\u00a0 instrument, and with the denominations employed therein; but if said measurement does not appear in the instrument, this fact shall be stated in the record.\"<\/blockquote>Section 36 of Act No. 496 of the Philippine Commission prescribes,\u00a0 among other things,\u00a0 the\u00a0 following:<br\/><blockquote>\"The court may in any case before decree require a survey to be made for the purpose of determining boundaries, and may order durable bounds to be set, and referred to in the application, by amendment.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Section 24 of Act\u00a0 No. 496, as amended by section\u00a0 7 of Act No. 1875, prescribes that;<br\/><blockquote>\"The application may include\u00a0 all the parcels of land or properties belonging to\u00a0 the applicant, provided\u00a0 they\u00a0 are situated within the same province or city.\u00a0 The court may at any time order an application to be amended by striking out one or more parcels or by severance\u00a0 of the application.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is a\u00a0 well settled doctrine of the courts, that a person who seeks to register his title of ownership to certain\u00a0 land in the Court of Land Registration, must, like another who brings an action for the recovery of possession, satisfactorily prove, not only his right of ownership, but also the identity of the land.\u00a0\u00a0 (Sison <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Ramos, 13 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 54, and Belen <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Belen,\u00a0 13 Phil. Rep., 202.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment\u00a0 appealed from recognizes\u00a0 the applicants' dominion\u00a0 over, or right of\u00a0 ownership to the said seven parcels of land, but, because the identity of each of them was not proved at the trial, in conformity with\u00a0 their respective titles,\u00a0 provision\u00a0 was made for the amendment of the application to the end that, at the rehearing, the plan might be corrected and the parcels of land therein comprised identified, for their due inscription in the property registry.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 merger of the eleven parcels of land,\u00a0 all differing in area, location, boundaries, and methods\u00a0 of acquisition combined to form one single tract, has given rise to the confusion\u00a0 which has prevented the speedy settlement of\u00a0 this case.\u00a0 When the applicants petitioned for the registration of the seven parcels of land for which they hold title deeds, they sought at the same time\u00a0 to register four other\u00a0 parcels, without proper titles,\u00a0 and for the purpose of forming one single tract of land, comprised within s. perimeter without\u00a0 breach\u00a0 of continuity, and\u00a0 adjacent\u00a0 one to\u00a0 the other, filed with the\u00a0 court a plan including the said eleven parcels in a\u00a0 single tract, whereas\u00a0 the\u00a0 conditions surrounding the last\u00a0 four are different from those affecting the first seven.<br\/><br\/>The application and plans exhibited by the counsel for the applicants contain\u00a0 a declaration of a\u00a0 larger area of\u00a0 land than the total\u00a0 of the respective areas of the parcels as set forth in each of the titles\u00a0 thereto; and, in order that the greater area alleged may prevail over that contained in each title exhibited by the said applicants, it must be proven\u00a0 that they\u00a0 are owners of the land claimed.\u00a0\u00a0 It has not been explained\u00a0 how\u00a0 the aforementioned\u00a0 seven\u00a0 parcels of land, legally acquired, have now come to contain a large area.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for\u00a0 the appellants, on page 9 of his brief, says that an ocular inspection of the land, or an order directing that the parcels of land found to belong to the applicants, be plainly marked on the plan, Exhibit F, would have been more expedient,\u00a0 before the rendition of the judgment of August 9, 1909, appealed from, and that, had\u00a0 such inspection\u00a0 been made or such order issued, his clients would not have had to include in their appeal the lands which unquestionably belong to them.<br\/><br\/>This voluntary statement shows still more clearly that if the applicants' right of ownership to the before-mentioned seven parcels\u00a0 of land is unquestionable their respective identity and location do not appear exactly determined in the three plans exhibited, especially in the plan Exhibit F, in respect to\u00a0 the several titles oi ownership of the said parcels, issued to the predecessors of the applicants by the Spanish\u00a0 Government.\u00a0\u00a0 It is therefore imperative that\u00a0 a new\u00a0 trial be held\u00a0 for the\u00a0 purpose indicated, to wit,\u00a0 the identification of the properties sought to be registered.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the parcels of land designated in the plan Exhibit F, under the numbers 1, 3, 5, and 6, and to which reference is made in the documents marked Exhibit CC, V, O and EE, neither may they be registered, as solicited, inasmuch as it has not been shown that the applicants or their predecessors\u00a0 in interest obtained from the State any title to them;\u00a0 nor\u00a0 does there appear to be any proof that they were in possession of the same as owners\u00a0 since 1894, the date of the issuance of the decrees contained in\u00a0 the documents Exhibits O, V,\u00a0 and CC, and which prescribed that the parcels of land referred to\u00a0 should be adjudicated to Cecilia Dominguez\u00a0 del Rosario - inasmuch as the total price of the lands adjudicated was not paid, and for such reason they did not, in legal manner,\u00a0 enter into the possession of the same.\u00a0 And with respect to the\u00a0 parcel of land concerned in the document Exhibit\u00a0 EE, page 206 of the record, this instrument merely contains the report relative to the\u00a0 expediency of the alienation of the land, sought to be obtained by the said Cecilia Dominguez, but says nothing of its sale or adjudication to her; therefore,\u00a0 the\u00a0 vendee not only did not enter into the possession of the land, but also did not acquire any right therein,\u00a0 and so it was that her daughter, Valeriana Calivara, concluded by stating that she waived her claim to the adjudication of the said fourth parcel of land, as shown by document No. 3, page 225 of the record.<br\/><br\/>The said four documents in\u00a0 no wise prove that the applicants were in possession of the said lands, although three of the parcels\u00a0 may have been\u00a0 adjudicated to one of their predecessors; nor does the record reveal\u00a0 satisfactory proof that they held\u00a0 such properties\u00a0 together with the land not adjudicated, Exhibit EE, because no legal possession exists that could be considered as interrupted by <i>force majeure,<\/i> as a result of the insurrection which broke out during the last months of the year 1896.<br\/><br\/>As before stated, aside\u00a0 from the lack\u00a0 of a perfect title, issued\u00a0 in due form, to the parcels\u00a0 of land adjudicated to Cecilia Dominguez by a decree\u00a0 of the <i>Intendencia General de Hacienda,<\/i> in 1894, the record does not show that the said three parcels of land referred to in the documents Exhibits\u00a0 CC, V, and\u00a0 O,\u00a0 were identified;\u00a0 hence, under no consideration could their entry be allowed upon the property registry,\u00a0 and,\u00a0 much less, the\u00a0 inscription therein\u00a0 of the fourth\u00a0 parcel,\u00a0 concerned\u00a0 in\u00a0 Exhibit EE which was not even adjudicated and the acquisition of which was expressly waived by Valeriana Calivara,\u00a0 page 225 of the record, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of section 54 of Act No.\u00a0 926, those persons who duly justify their possession of the land, the\u00a0 title\u00a0 of\u00a0 which was not perfected on\u00a0 account of noncompliance with\u00a0 certain requisites established by law and through no default\u00a0 upon their part are the only ones entitled to perfect their titles.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 order\u00a0 to\u00a0 show more clearly the\u00a0 impropriety\u00a0 of the registration, not only of the land referred to\u00a0 in\u00a0 Exhibit EE, but also of the lands concerned in the\u00a0 decrees issued on behalf of the applicants and transcribed\u00a0 in the documents Exhibits\u00a0 CC, V, and 0, it is noted that the record bears no proof of Cecilia Dominguez having conveyed her rights in the three parcels of land\u00a0 last mentioned to\u00a0 Valeriana Calivara,\u00a0 the applicants' predecessor in interest, for clause 6 of the document Exhibit G, found on page 83 of the\u00a0 record, sets out no sale or conveyance to Calivara of\u00a0 any rights which\u00a0 Dominguez\u00a0 may have acquired through\u00a0 the adjudication of said lands.<br\/><br\/>In the additional brief of the appellants, petition\u00a0 is also made for the dissolution of the writ of injunction issued on\u00a0 behalf of the\u00a0 twenty-four opponents\u00a0 who made their appearance\u00a0 in\u00a0 this\u00a0 case,\u00a0 and it is alleged that\u00a0 the latter have no right to any part of the land which is the subject of the application.<br\/><br\/>As it does not appear specifically determined whether the lands claimed by these twenty-four opponents who obtained the said writ of injunction, are or are not comprised\u00a0 within the area of the parcels of land\u00a0 provided with titles issued by the State\u00a0 to some of the predecessors of the\u00a0 applicants, which parcels are\u00a0 those numbered 2, 4, 7,\u00a0 8, 9, 10, and 11, in the plan Exhibit F, it is impossible, at the present time, to grant such dissolution.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, it is proper, in our opinion, to affirm the judgment of August 9, 1909, and to reverse that of\u00a0 the 30th of the same month and year.\u00a0 Therefore, let the record in this case be returned to the\u00a0 Court of Land Registration, with a certified copy of this\u00a0 decision, in order that, after amendment of the application, which shall comprise only the seven parcels of land that are provided with legitimate titles and numbered in\u00a0 the plan Exhibit F, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9,10, and 11, the judge of the lower court may proceed with a new trial, so that the applicants may\u00a0 furnish a plan prepared\u00a0 in\u00a0 conformity with the titles of the said seven parcels\u00a0 of land, which shall express the present location, area, superficial measurement and boundaries of each of them, and evidence be adduced\u00a0 for the identification of the same.\u00a0 As a\u00a0 result of such\u00a0 proceedings and of\u00a0 the evidence previously taken, the court shall, in due season, render such judgment as may be deemed\u00a0 proper under the law and in accordance with the merits.\u00a0\u00a0 It is inopportune at the present time to dissolve\u00a0 the injunction issued on behalf of the\u00a0 twenty-four\u00a0 opponents, and\u00a0 therefore\u00a0 the motion\u00a0 made by the counsel for the applicants, is denied.

The\u00a0 latter, therefore, accompanied by a policeman, immediately went\u00a0 to the defendant's\u00a0 house where\u00a0 he\u00a0 found the\u00a0 corpse\u00a0 of the man referred\u00a0 to It was lying face-down on a mat with\u00a0 the head on the floor, and bore a wound in the left side between the clavicle and the neck.\u00a0\u00a0 Beside the body was\u00a0 a sheet which had an opening produced apparently by a\u00a0 cutting instrument.\u00a0 The\u00a0 said lieutenant in his sworn\u00a0 testimony stated: that defendant and Honorio Algar had been living together conjugally\u00a0 for more than\u00a0 ten years and had seven\u00a0 children,\u00a0 two of whom he found asleep inside the said\u00a0 house and near the place where the corpse was lying; the on that occasion, Honorio Algar\u00a0 was\u00a0 out\u00a0 of the house and absent from the town; that, at the\u00a0 time of the occurrence, Luisa Potestas was enceinte that\u00a0 it was known that she was about\u00a0 in the seventh month of pregnancy for which, she stated, her paramour was\u00a0 responsible; that the\u00a0 deceased father,\u00a0 Andres Villaflor,\u00a0 said\u00a0 in\u00a0 his sworn statement that he knew t son Bonifacio used to go frequently to\u00a0 the\u00a0 house of Luisa Potestas, taking advantage of the absences of her paramour,\u00a0 Honorio Algar, who was in the habit of absenting himself\u00a0 from his home for purposes of business; that Bonifacio maintained amorous relations with the defendant his mistress,\u00a0 as\u00a0 she would\u00a0 frequently look for him and\u00a0 he\u00a0 used to s in the house of the crime whenever Honorio Algar was absent therefrom, and that\u00a0 he did not know why the\u00a0 defendant killed his\u00a0 son.\u00a0 Luisa Potestas, in her sworn statement, confessed that it\u00a0 was\u00a0 she\u00a0 who stabbed the deceased and caused his\u00a0 death for the reason she alleged.<\/p><p>An information was\u00a0 filed in the Court of First Instance by the provincial on September 13, 1911, charging Luisa Potestas with\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime of\u00a0 murder and, upon\u00a0 the institution of this case, the judge pronounced the sentence that is the subject of this appeal.<\/p><p>From the facts aforestated it is concluded that Bonifacio Villaflor was violently killed while he was in Luisa Potestas' bed, inside\u00a0 of the hou which\u00a0 she lived.\u00a0\u00a0 The motive which prompted the killing could not be ascertained.\u00a0 For some time prior to the\u00a0 crime the deceased\u00a0 and the defendant had been on very intimate terms,\u00a0 as Villaflor, taking advantantage of the absences of Honorio\u00a0 Algar, the old and permanent paramour of the woman Potestas, used to frequent the latter's house and there pass\u00a0 the night with her. Although\u00a0 the defendant confessed that she inflicted upon Villaflor the only wound which he received, one between the neck\u00a0 and\u00a0 the clavicle,\u00a0 yet\u00a0 she alleged a\u00a0 certain defense which will be considered. was no eyewitness\u00a0 to the commission\u00a0 of the crime, nor is it shown by t record that the assaulted party, Villaflor, was asleep when he received mortal wound which\u00a0 caused his death.\u00a0 We\u00a0 therefore accept the opinion formed by the trial\u00a0 judge in classifying the crime as homicide, pursuant\u00a0 article 404 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 It was not proven at the trial that there was present any of the\u00a0 qualifying\u00a0 circumstances of murder such\u00a0 as determine the imposition\u00a0 of a severer\u00a0 penalty.<\/p><p>The defendant pleaded not guilty and alleged that while asleep in her ho on the night aforementioned, the door and windows having been closed and fastened, she awoke\u00a0 on feeling that a man was\u00a0 touching her head and laying himself on\u00a0 top\u00a0 of her for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose\u00a0 of abusing her; that while trying to prevent him from so doing, she chanced to catch hold of hilt of a weapon which the man on top of her was carrying in his belt, whereupon, while she was still endeavoring to prevent her aggressor from carrying out his purpose, in spite of the fact that\u00a0 with one hand he was covering her mouth and with the other trying to raise her skirt, and as result of the\u00a0 efforts she made to free herself, the\u00a0 weapon, the hilt o which\u00a0 she\u00a0 was holding in her right hand, came out\u00a0 of its\u00a0 scabbard an pierced her aggressor's\u00a0 body,\u00a0 although she\u00a0 did not\u00a0 then know that th man,\u00a0 on getting up, had already been wounded; that she in turn also got up\u00a0 and went to\u00a0 the window,\u00a0 from which she jumped out,\u00a0 whereupon she noticed that the man was panting and fell to the floor; and that immediately thereafter she left the\u00a0 place to present\u00a0 herself to the leutenant of the barrio to whom\u00a0 she delivered the weapon she carried.<\/p><p>In view of the evidence presented, and notwithstanding that there was.no eyewitness\u00a0 to the occurrence, the defendant's testimony is in\u00a0 all resp improbable and incredible, and, therefore, can support no finding\u00a0 of exemption\u00a0 from responsibility\u00a0 on the ground that she acted\u00a0 in\u00a0 legitimate defense of her honor; nor can it be admitted, as she alleged, that she involuntarily\u00a0 assaulted the\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 with the dagger.<\/p><p>The evidence\u00a0 in fact shows that the lieutenant of the barrio, Carmelo G and the deceased's father, Andres Villaflor, upon visiting the house of crime, found that the entrance door thereof was closed and barred and th all its windows were also closed, except one. through which the policeman Felicio Ibo, entered, by order of the lieutenant, for the purpose of ope the said door; that,\u00a0 upon examining the clothes\u00a0 in\u00a0 which the body was dressed, no disorder was noticed in them and it was observed that the trousers were\u00a0 buttoned up; that the body, from the feet to the shoulder was lying stretched\u00a0 out\u00a0 on a\u00a0 mat, and the head was off the mat\u00a0 and resting on the bare floor; that they found a pillow with signs of two depressions, one beside the other, apparently produced by the weight of heads lying on it, and a sheet stained with blood, with a hole in it, apparently cut by the dagger presented by the defendant to the barrio lieutenant; and that the wound borne by the body was situated between the neck and the left clavicle; from all of which testimony\u00a0 it is concluded into consideration the defendant's\u00a0 statement that she held the weapon i her right hand, that she inflicted the wound at a time when\u00a0 the decease was at her side; that there was no attempted rape, an indefensible allegation, because it was proven that the deceased had for some time pa been maintaining unlawful relations with her and therefore,\u00a0 as\u00a0 he frequented her house and was in habit of sleeping there with her on the occasions o the absence of her other paramour, he had no need of exercising against her either force or violence, for\u00a0 they\u00a0 were accustomed\u00a0 to cohabit of own free will and accord.\u00a0 The last time that the deceased passed\u00a0 the night in the said house,\u00a0 the defendant,\u00a0 his mistress, inflicted upon h fatal wound and\u00a0 thus committed, at least, the crime of homicide, as the defendant, who was the aggressor, made use, not of a weapon carried by the deceased, but of one which she had and which, two days\u00a0 before, was seen by the\u00a0 victim's\u00a0 father in the possession of\u00a0 her\u00a0 brother, Esteba Potestas. It can not be believed that the commission of the crime was preceded by a struggle or\u00a0 even by any dispute between the assailant and her victim, because the children, who were sleeping in\u00a0 the same house a a short distance from the place where the body was found, were still asl when the policeman,\u00a0 the barrio lieutenant,\u00a0 and the\u00a0 deceased's father entered the building.<\/p><p>Although the criminal\u00a0 act was perpetrated at\u00a0 night, the circumstance o nocturnity is not to be taken into account, because the record does not that the cover of darkness was purposely\u00a0 sought, and\u00a0 because the\u00a0 crime was committed upon a person who used to frequent the house with the consent of the owner thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no aggravating\u00a0 circumstance to consider, and\u00a0 no extenuating one, except that prescribed in article 11 Penal Code, amended by Act No. 2142, on account of the ignorance and lack of education\u00a0 of the defendant, and, therefore,\u00a0 the penalty of homicide should be imposed in its medium degree.<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons, it is proper, in our opinion, to affirm the judgment appealed\u00a0 from; provided, however, that the defendant, Luisa Potestas, s be sentenced to the penalty of only twelve years and one day of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">reclusion temporal,<\/span> to the accessories\u00a0 of article\u00a0 59, and to pay the indemnity a costs mentioned in the said judgment, together with the cost of this ins So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

partnership composed of Isidoro Aragon, Lucio Cuneta Cruz and\u00a0 Modesto\u00a0 de la Cruz, owned a cockpit which\u00a0 it rented to\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 company.\u00a0\u00a0 On the 14th of December,\u00a0 1908, Lucio Cuneta Cruz sold his interest in the partnership\u00a0 (two-fifths\u00a0 share)\u00a0 to\u00a0 the plaintiff, reserving the right to\u00a0 repurchase under certain conditions.\u00a0 Plaintiff claims that\u00a0 the vendor\u00a0 having failed to exercise his\u00a0 right to repurchase,\u00a0 the\u00a0 sale\u00a0 became\u00a0 absolute on\u00a0 the 15th day\u00a0 of February , 1909, and that since that date he has been the sole owner of this two-fifths interest in the partnership.\u00a0 It appears also that plaintiff purchased the interest of Isidoro Aragon in the partnership (also a two-fifths share), on the 21st of May, 1910, and that Modesto de la Cruz, one of the defendants\u00a0 in this action, continues\u00a0 to\u00a0 hold his original interest in the partnership (a one-fifth share).<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>Plaintiff\u00a0 in this action seeks\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 to, recover\u00a0 of the defendant company the\u00a0 amount of the\u00a0 monthly rental which he claims to be due him as the owner of Lucio Cuneta Cruz' interest since the 15th day of February,\u00a0 1909; and\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 to terminate the rental\u00a0 contract,\u00a0 on\u00a0 the ground that\u00a0 as the owner\u00a0 of a four-fifths share in the renting partnership he is entitled to exercise the right of control therein.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>We think that the\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 of\u00a0 record fully\u00a0 establishes the claim of the plaintiff as to his\u00a0 purchase of the interest of Lucio Cuneta Cruz\u00a0 in the partnership which entered into the rental contract with\u00a0 the defendant company;\u00a0 and also that under the terms of that contract the defendant company obligated itself to pay\u00a0 to the owner of that interest the sum of P280 per\u00a0 month so long as\u00a0 the contract continued\u00a0 in force; that the\u00a0 contract continued in\u00a0 force up to\u00a0 the\u00a0 date of the entry of\u00a0 judgment in the court below; and\u00a0 that the plaintiff became the\u00a0 absolute\u00a0 owner\u00a0 of\u00a0 Cuneta Cruz' interest on February 15, 1909.<p><\/p><p> The\u00a0 trial judge\u00a0 recognized the right of the plaintiff\u00a0 to recover this monthly\u00a0 rental from\u00a0 the defendant company from the date of the judgment entered by him, but declined to give judgment for the monthly rental from the date when the purchase of Cuneta Cruz' interest was perfected (February 15, 1909)\u00a0 to the date of the judgment.\u00a0 This on the ground that during that period Cuneta Cruz was contesting plaintiff's claim that he had purchased this interest in the jpartnership.\u00a0 The trial\u00a0 judge appears\u00a0 to have\u00a0 been\u00a0 of opinion that since there had been no formal adjudication of plaintiff's ownership of Cuneta Cruz' interest prior to the pate of the judgment, the defendant company was not obligated to pay the plaintiff the monthly rental corresponding to that interest pending the adjudication of this question, since, as he held, to have done so might have exposed it to the risk of having the contract terminated \"by Cuneta Cruz for failure to pay to him the stipulated rental, in the event that it should\u00a0 later be judicially determined that\u00a0 Cuneta Cruz and not the plaintiff was the true owner, and that the purchase had not been consummated on the 15th of February, 1909, as claimed by the plaintiff.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 In this we\u00a0 hold that the trial judge erred.\u00a0 The defendant company had due and sufficient notice of the sale at the time when the plaintiff perfected his purchase of Cuneta Cruz' interest.\u00a0 Demand was formally and promptly made upon it for the payment of the rent to which\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 was thereafter entitled.\u00a0\u00a0 Under\u00a0 its contract\u00a0 it\u00a0 was the\u00a0 defendant company's duty to pay the stipulated rent\u00a0 to the owner of the interest originally held by Cuneta.\u00a0 If with\u00a0 due notice of the purchase of this interest by plaintiff, it paid any other person than\u00a0 the true owner, such payment in no wise relieved\u00a0 it of its\u00a0 obligations under the contract to pay the true owner.\u00a0 It must fulfill and comply with the terms of its contract, and the plaintiff is entitled\u00a0 to recover the stipulated\u00a0 rent from the 15th day of February, 1909,\u00a0 and\u00a0 so long as the rental contract between the partnership and the defendant company\u00a0 remains in force.\u00a0 Judgment for\u00a0 the rent in question from\u00a0 the\u00a0 15th day\u00a0 of\u00a0 February, 1909,\u00a0 to the date of the judgment should have been rendered in favor of the plaintiff, together\u00a0 with interest\u00a0 at\u00a0 the rate of six per centum per\u00a0 annum upon the amount of the rent for each month from the date when it fell due to the date of payment.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>We do not recognize the\u00a0 force of the\u00a0 contention\u00a0 that merely because the right of ownership was in dispute the defendant company lawfully refused\u00a0 to pay the rent to the plaintiff, on the ground that it could not be required to take the rink of paying the wrong person\u00a0 and suffering the consequences.\u00a0 Section\u00a0 120\u00a0 of the Code\u00a0 of\u00a0 Civil\u00a0 Procedure provides for\u00a0 just such\u00a0 a case.\u00a0 If the defendant company had any sufficient ground to be in doubt as\u00a0 to which of the claimants was entitled\u00a0 to the rent, it could have protected thus leaving the determination of the doubt to the courts.\u00a0 The defendant company not having exercised this right, it voluntarily assumed the risk of payment to the wrong person, and of course payment to the wrong person under such circumstances\u00a0 (even if it\u00a0 were actually made,\u00a0 which does \u00a3\u00bbot affirmatively appear from the record in the case), would not relieve it of liability to the person lawfully entitled to receive payment under the rental contract.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>We agree with the trial court that the plaintiff's prayer that the rental contract with the defendant company be terminated can not be granted in this action.\u00a0\u00a0 We, however, place our denial of this prayer on a different ground from that assigned in the court below.\u00a0 Plaintiff appears to rest his demand for the termination of the contract on the ground that as the owner of two of the\u00a0 three interests which originally constituted the partnership (a \"<em>sociedad colectiva<\/em>\" as defined in article 2 of title 1 of the Code of Commerce) that entered into the rental contract with the defendant company, these two interests constituting a four-fifths share in that partnership, he is entitled to control the operations of the partnership.\u00a0 But\u00a0 without discussing or deciding that question, we\u00a0 hold that even if it be admitted that plaintiff's purchase of two of the three original interests representing a four-fifths share in the partnership gave him the right to\u00a0 control the operations\u00a0 of the partnership, subject; of course, to the Code provisions in such cases, it does not necessarily follow that he can arbitrarily repudiate the rental contract entered into by the partnership before he purchased the majority interest therein.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>The\u00a0 right\u00a0 to terminate the contractual relations\u00a0 between the parties, and the conditions upon which one\u00a0 or\u00a0 other of the contracting parties may exercise this right necessarily depends on the contract itself.\u00a0 It does not definitely appear from\u00a0 the record whether the contract was or was not reduced to writing; and while there does not seem to have been any question in the court below as to some of its terms, the contract itself is not before us.\u00a0 It is alleged that it contained a stipulation that the contract was to continue in force so long as the defendant company continued in existence.\u00a0\u00a0 Of course,\u00a0 if the contract was not in writing, this condition\u00a0 could\u00a0 not be\u00a0 enforced; but if\u00a0 the\u00a0 contract was executed in due form,\u00a0 and as such\u00a0 is enforceable in the courts, and if this\u00a0 was the only condition touching its duration contained therein, it would appear that the relation of landlord and tenant could not be terminated at the will of one of the parties so long at least as the other party lived up to its obligations, and the defendant company continued in existence.\u00a0\u00a0 We reserve our opinion, however, on the question as\u00a0 to the\u00a0 precise\u00a0 conditions under which such a contract might be terminated, it\u00a0 not being necessary to go into that question in the absence of the contract itself.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Plaintiff having failed to establish satisfactorily the terms and conditions of\u00a0 the rental contract, it\u00a0 is impossible for us to determine the conditions, if any,\u00a0 upon which he, acting for the partnership, may exercise his alleged right to terminate it; or to hold that under the contract, the society or partnership in which plaintiff holds\u00a0 a controlling\u00a0 interest has a right to have the contract rescinded.\u00a0\u00a0 So far therefore as the judgment of the\u00a0 court below denies the right of the plaintiff to have\u00a0 the rental contract in question terminated in this action it should be affirmed, reserving to the plaintiff, however, the right to institute a new action or to take such steps as he may deem proper, hereafter, with a view to the exercise of any right he may have, under the contract,\u00a0 to rescind or\u00a0 terminate the same.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Ten\u00a0 days hereafter let judgment be entered\u00a0 reversing the judgment of the court below without costs\u00a0 in this instance, and twenty days thereafter let the record be returned to the court wherein it\u00a0 originated, which will enter final judgment,\u00a0 in accordance\u00a0 with the\u00a0 principles herein laid down.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J., Torres,\u00a0 Mapa,

Said section  provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Collector of  Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of Finance and Justice, may compromise any civil or other case arising from the provisions of this Act instead of commencing or prosecuting suit thereon, and, with the consent of the Secretary of Finance and Justice, he may compromise such  case after action has been begun thereon.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It also appears from the record that during the  course of the negotiations for said compromise, the defendant paid to a representative of the Internal Revenue Department the sum of P700.  It also appears from the record that the attempted compromise was never fully completed.   The record shows that the Collector of Internal Revenue refused to conclude the attempted compromise.  There is nothing in the record which shows that the question had ever been presented to the  Secretary of Finance and Justice.  The compromise under said quoted section can not be completed without the approval o\u00a3 the said Secretary, and until the compromise is completed, with the approval  of the Secretary, no negotiations for a  compromise can  affect the criminal prosecution instituted.  Had the compromise been completed, with the approval of the Secretary of Finance and Justice, it would then have had the effect  of terminating the criminal action.   Mere negotiations for a compromise can not affect the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance over the criminal action.  The compromise, however, may be perfected \"after the action has been begun.\" The attempted compromise not having been carried to a termination,  in accordance with the provisions of said section (25), did  in no way affect the criminal prosecution begun in the Court of First Instance.<\/p>\n<p>Upon a  careful examination of the record brought to this court, arid taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances connected with the commission of the crime, we are of the opinion that the defendant should  be  punished with a fine only.<\/p>\n<p>The sentence of the  lower court is, therefore, hereby modified, and it is hereby ordered that the  defendant, Que Ung Bo, be sentenced to pay a fine of ?600, in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay one-half the costs in the lower court and the costs in this court.<\/p>\n<p>The record does not disclose whether or not the said sum of P700 has been returned  to the defendant.

For this reason they have been considered together by all the parties and  it is agreed that the decision of one shall be a decision as to all.<\/p>\n<p>In his brief the Acting Attorney-General says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This is an appeal taken by the Commanding General of the  Division of the Philippines against the decision of the Court of Land Registration in the three cases above named and dated the 11th, 13th and 14th of June,  1910,  respectively, adjudicating to  each one of the petitioners the land described in his petition, and overruling the opposition of the Commanding General of the Division of the Philippines, which opposition  is founded upon  the fact that the lands described in  said  causes are located  within the military reservation of Biliran and are the property of the Government of the United States in the Philippine Islands, and in the further fact that the applications in said three causes were presented a long time after the expiration of the time provided by law within which they must  be presented.<\/p>\n<p>\"These proceedings were begun in the Court of Land Registration upon petitions presented by the applicants.   These petitions were presented as follows: That of Eulalio Lagariza was received in the Court of Land Registration on the 17th of May, 1909;  that of Laureano  Saba on the 24th of May, 1909; and that of Justiniano Garcia on the last-mentioned date.  The Commanding General  of the Division of the Philippines, through his counsel, the Attorney-General, interposed objections against said petitions.  The trial of said causes was had  before the Court of Land Registration and judgments were rendered by that  court overruling the opposition in each one of said causes as  already stated.  The application for a new trial in each one of said causes was denied by the  court,  and  the corresponding  exceptions having been taken, both against the decisions and against the orders overruling  the motions for a new trial, these appeals were taken.<\/p>\n<p>\"The appeal interposed by the Commanding General of the Division of the Philippines  in each one of these cases is based upon  the fact that the respective petitions were presented after the termination of the  period prescribed by Act No.  627 relating to  military reservations; for, as  has already been said, the lands in question are located within the limits of the military reservation of Biliran, duly established by virtue of an executive order of the President of the United States, duly published in these Islands in a proclamation  of  the  Governor-General,   which proclamation was, on the 10th day of August, 1908, duly notified to the owners of lands within the said reservation and to all persons who might be interested therein.<\/p>\n<p>\"The appellant contends that said petitions having been presented after the  expiration of the period prescribed by Act No. 627, the court below erred in not sustaining  the opposition of the Commanding  General of the Division of the Philippines in each one of said cases.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The Acting  Attorney-General contends that Act No. 627, as amended, requires that applications such as those presented by the petitioners in these cases  shall be presented to the Court of Land Registration within six months from the date of the notice published in pursuance of the proclamation of the Governor-General; and that the six months' limitation prescribed by that Act begins to run from the date of the notice and not from the time such  notice is received by the person upon whom it is personally served. Sections 3 and 4 of the Act referred  to read as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"SEC. 3. Immediately upon receipt of the notice from the Civil Governor in  the preceding section mentioned it shall be the duty  of the judge of the Court of Land Registration to issue a notice,  stating that the lands within the limits aforesaid have been reserved for military purposes, and announced and declared to be military  reservations, and that claims for all private lands, and interests therein, within the limits  aforesaid, must  be presented for registration under the Land Registration Act within six calendar months from the date of issuing the notice, and that all lands, buildings, and interests therein within the limits aforesaid not so presented within the time therein limited will  be conclusively adjudged to be public lands, and all claims on the part of private individuals for such lands, buildings, or an interest  therein not so presented will be forever barred.   The clerk of the Court of Land Registration shall immediately upon the issuing of such notice by the judge cause the same to be published once a week for three successive weeks in two newspapers, one of which newspapers shall be in the English language,  and one in  the Spanish language in the city or province where the land lies, and, if there be no such Spanish or English newspapers having a general circulation in the city or province wherein the land lies, then it shall be a sufficient  compliance with this  section if the notice be published, as herein provided, in  a daily newspaper in the Spanish language and one in the English language, in the city of Manila, having a general circulation.   The  clerk shall also cause  a duly attested copy of the notice in the Spanish language to be posted in a conspicuous place at each angle formed by the lines of the limits of the land so reserved.  The clerk shall also issue and cause to be personally served the notice in the Spanish  language upon every person living upon or in visible possession of any part of the military reservation.  If the person in possession is the head of a family living upon the land, it shall be sufficient to serve the notice upon him, and if he is absent it shall be sufficient to leave a copy at his usual place of residence. The clerk shall certify the manner in which the notices have been published, posted,  and served, and his certificate shall be conclusive proof of such publication, posting, and service, but the court shall have power to cause such further notice to be given as in its opinion may be necessary.<\/p>\n<p>\"SEC.4. All claims for private lands, buildings, and  interests therein within the limits of such military reservation not presented to the Court of Land Registration within six months from the date of the notice in the previous section provided, shall be forever barred, and the lands, buildings, and interests therein shall be deemed to be public and not private property: Provided, nevertheless, That it shall be in the power of the Court of Land Registration, on suitable application, filed within three  months after the expiration of the six months first aforesaid,  to allow  an application and claim to be filed upon  proof that the failure to file it within the six months'  limitation resulted from fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable  negligence.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>We are of the opinion  that  the  contention above  stated can not be sustained.   As is seen from the wording of the sections just  quoted, the law  contemplates  notification to two classes of persons: one, those who are \"living upon or in visible possession of any part of the military reservation  the other, those persons who are not living upon or in visible possession of any  part  of the military reservation, but are absentees. A distinction is made in the law between these two  classes of persons  as to the manner in  which service of such  notice shall be made.  Service is complete under the law as to  those persons who are not living upon or in visible possession  of any  portion of the lands in question when publication  of the  notice in  the  newspapers is completed and duly fixed upon the four corners of the premises as required by  the law.   When these two  things are done service upon those persons who are not living upon or in visible possession of the premises is complete, and the six months' period  then begins to  run.   But as to those persons who are living upon or in visible possession of the lands, the service is not complete and the six months period does  not begin to run until the notice is served upon them personally.   As to this class, it is of no consequence when the notice was published  or when  it was posted.  Their rights relative to the period within which they must respond are determined by the date of the  personal service.  The date of the notice, or the time of its publication, or when it was posted upon the premises, has no influence, direct or indirect, upon the time within which persons living upon or in visible possession of the premises must  present their claims.  The publication is, of itself, no sufficient notice to them; nor is the posting of notice upon the premises.  Their notice is a personal notice, given by personal service, and only such notice can set the period  running  against them. If the six months period  begins  to run from the date of the notice and  not from the date of personal service, then the notice may  be served upon a person in possession of the premises on the  very day  that  the six  months'  period expires, and, indeed, on  the very last hour  of  that day. Such  service, being a good  service under the theory  advanced, would effectually deprive the person so served of his property as it would give him no opportunity to present his claim. <\/p>\n<p>The petitioners in these cases were living upon and in visible possession of the lands in  question at the time  the notice referred to was personally served.   It was served upon  them  during the month of December,  1908.  They were  entitled to six months  from the date of that service within which to present their petitions relative to the land in question, or until the month of June, 1909.  The petitions were  as a  matter of fact  presented during the  month  of May,  1909,  clearly within the period of six  months prescribed by Act No. 627, as amended.<\/p>\n<p>The judgments of  the Court  of Land Registration in the above cases are hereby severally affirmed, without special finding as to costs.<\/p>\n<p><em> Arellano, C.

Immediately Sargan shovelled off some coal on top and picked up some lumps and threw them out from the pile and under this coal was found this can of opium.\u00a0\u00a0 I immediately took off my coat and got the shovel and went to work\u00a0 and sweat pretty hard, and went all through the coal pile a could not find any more. Worked for about an hour.\u00a0 I then brought out the can and held it up like this, and this Chinaman (indicating the defendant 'It is mine.'\u00a0 I then looked at the license. His name was not on the lice the place.<\/p><p>\"*\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 I said to\u00a0 Sargan: 'You ask him also so that we can all hear i And\u00a0 Sargan asked him too, and he (defendant) said it was his.\" Sargan testified substantially as follows:<\/p><p>\"I, Mr. Best, Mr.\u00a0 Ramos, and Benjamin went\u00a0 down to the place called San Cristo No. 178 and searched the place there.\u00a0 In the coal pile near where make some sugar I found this opium.\u00a0 When Mr. Best held up this can and said: 'Who is the owner of this can?' immediately this Chinaman (the defendant) answered saying that this can belonged to\u00a0 him.\u00a0 I asked him also, whose this can was and he said: 'It is mine.'\u00a0 I asked him in Tagal and he appeared to understand what I said.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The defendant\u00a0 So\u00a0 Fo testified\u00a0 in\u00a0 his own\u00a0 behalf\u00a0 and stated in substance that he was\u00a0 an employee of the owner of the place where the opium was found; that the opium was\u00a0 not his; that he had never had it in his possession,\u00a0 and that\u00a0 he never confessed or stated to either Best or Sargan or to anyone that the can of opium which was found in the coal pile belonged\u00a0 to\u00a0 him.\u00a0\u00a0 Tan Quin\u00a0 Chioc, who was, at the time this case was tried in the court below, serving a sentence\u00a0 of three\u00a0 months in Bil Prison, being called as a witness for the defense, testified that he live No. 178 Santo Cristo; that he placed\u00a0 the opium in the\u00a0 coal pile, and the belonged to him.<\/p><p>That the can of\u00a0 opium exhibited in the court below was found in\u00a0 the\u00a0 co pile at\u00a0 the time and place stated\u00a0 by the agents of the Bureau of Intern Revenue is not denied. Counsel for the defendant argues, as we have said that in view of the fact that defendant could not speak English and\u00a0 could only speak Tagalog\u00a0 (aside\u00a0 from\u00a0 his\u00a0 native language), the internal rev agents were mistaken when they said that the\u00a0 defendant stated to them that the opium was\u00a0 his property; and (2)\u00a0 that the testimony of record does not establish\u00a0 the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.<\/p><p>With reference to the first proposition, we think there can be no question that the defendant did state more than once when the opium\u00a0 was found that he was the\u00a0 owner of the same, and that these statements or confessions were made entirely upon his own volition.\u00a0 The two internal r agents testified\u00a0 that when they asked to whom\u00a0 the opium belonged they spoke in Tagalog and that\u00a0 the defendant answered them in\u00a0 the same language.<\/p><p>The second proposition raises the question whether or not an uncorroborat extrajudicial confession later\u00a0 denied upon the trial of the cause is sufficient upon which to rest a judgment of conviction.\u00a0 In Hopt <em>vs. <\/em>People o Utah, (110 U.\u00a0 S., 574, 28 L. ed., 262), Hopt\u00a0 was sentenced to death for murder of one Turner.\u00a0\u00a0 In considering the probative force of an extrajudicial oral confession, the Supreme Court of the United States said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"While some of the adjudged\u00a0 cases indicate distrust of confessions which not judicial, it is certain, as observed by\u00a0 Baron Parke in Regina vs. (2 Den., 430, 445), that the rule against their admissibility has been so carried too far, and in its application justice and common sense have\u00a0 to frequently been sacrificed at the shrine of mercy,\u00a0 A\u00a0 confession, if freely and voluntarily\u00a0 made, is evidence of the most satisfactory character.\u00a0 S confession, said Eyre, C. B.\u00a0 (King <em>vs<\/em>. Warickshall, 1 Leach., 2 deserving of the highest credit, because it is presumed to flow from the strongest sense of guilt and, therefore, it is admitted as proof of the c which it refers.'<\/p><p>\"Elementary writers of authority concur\u00a0 in saying that, while from the v nature of such evidence it must\u00a0 be subjected to careful scrutiny and rec with great caution, a\u00a0 deliberate, voluntary confession of guilt is\u00a0 among most\u00a0 effectual proofs\u00a0 in the law, and\u00a0 constitutes the strongest evidence against the party making it that can be given of the facts stated\u00a0 in such confession.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (1 Greenl.

THE MANILA  RAILROAD  COMPANY, DEFENDANT  AND  APPELLANT.\n  <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"><p>This is an action to recover damages for the alleged unlawful detention and occupation  by defendant of a small parcel of land, the property of the plaintiff, situated near the railroad station  in Dagupan  in the Province of  Pangasinan.<\/p>\n<p>Plaintiff alleges that the land in  question, some 1,219 square meters in extent, is worth P7,314.40; that before it was entered upon by defendant, two  small houses erected thereon brought her a rental at the rate of P280 per annum, of which she has been deprived by defendant since the month of March, 1907; that the defendant company compelled her to move three buildings from the land taken by it, whereby she had suffered damages in the sum  of P400 and that as a result of the unlawful occupation of this tract of land by the defendant company she had suffered further  damages to the extent of P250 from the accumulation of water on an adjoining parcel of land of which she is the owner.<\/p>\n<p>Defendant company answering, admits that  it has taken and is now occupying a small part of  the land in question, 314 meters in extent; but alleges that  it is now and always has been ready and willing to pay the plaintiff a fair price for the land thus taken and all damages to the remainder of her land  resulting therefrom.<\/p>\n<p>In explanation of the fact that it took possession of and continues to occupy this part of the land in question without the express consent of the plaintiff and without having made payment therefor, defendant company  alleges  that the land  taken is a part of certain lands described in  condemnation proceedings instituted  in the  Court of  First Instance of the Province of Pangasinan, whereby, by virtue of the authority lawfully  conferred  upon  defendant company, it sought to have the land in question, and other lands in that province, condemned for use as a  roadbed; and while the facts are not fully developed in the  record, it does appear that  condemnation proceedings were regularly instituted for the purposes indicated, and there are indications in the record that the land in question was included in the lands sought to  be condemned therein, but that in those proceedings it was described as the property of one Silvino Tenorio, although the name of the true owner, the plaintiff in this action, is, as she alleges, Silvestra Tenorio.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant company both by demurrer and answer, undertook  in the court below to question plaintiff's  right to maintain this action (which is  an ordinary action for damages for trespass on plaintiff's land) on the ground that under  the  statutory provisions for the condemnation of lands by virtue of which defendant company had already instituted proceedings looking to the condemnation of the land in question, it  was the duty  of the plantiff to seek redress in, those proceedings.  But while  we agree  with counsel for defendant company  that, had the  defendant company before  entering upon  and  taking  possession of the land in question, proceeded in accordance with the provisions of law touching condemnation proceedings, by virtue of which it claims to have been  acting,  in that event the plaintiff would not be'entitled to bring a separate action; we are of  opinion that in  the absence of proof of a substantial compliance with the provisions of law  touching such proceedings the plaintiff was clearly entitled to institute any appropriate action to recover the damages which she may have suffered as a result of an unauthorized and unlawful seizure  and occupation of her property.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The mode in which land may be condemned and the steps to be taken for that purpose are prescribed  either by the statute or charter conferring the right of eminent domain or by a general law.  The remedy so provided is exclusive, and as a general rule the steps prescribed by the statute must be followed or  the  proceedings will be void.  Since these statutes are in derogation of general right and of common-law modes  of  procedure, they must be  strictly construed in favor of the landowner, and must be at least substantially or as sometimes said,  'fully and fairly' complied with.  Indeed the general rule in the absence of statutory provision to the contrary,  is that they must be strictly complied with.   *  *  *   Thus the  statutes must be complied with  as  to filing and  contents of petition or application, *   *   *   notice to the landowner  and other persons interested in the property,   *  *   *   and all other conditions precedent prescribed by the statute.\"   (Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure, vol. 15, pp.  815-817, and  cases cited.  See also American and  English Encyclopedia  of Law, vol. 10, p. 1054,  and cases cited.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The mode in which the defendant company was authorized to exercise the power  of eminent domain is to be found in various Acts of the Commission  of which the following are pertinent citations:<\/p>\n<p>'The Government of the Philippine  Islands,  or of any province or department thereof, or of any municipality, and any person, or public or private corporation having by law the right to condemn private property for public use, shall exercise  that right in the manner hereinafter prescribed.\" (Act No. 190 of the Philippine Commission, sec. 241.)<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The complaint in condemnation  proceedings  shall state with certainty the right of condemnation,  and describe the property sought to be  condemned, showing the interest of each defendant separately.\"  (Act No. 190, sec. 242.)<\/p>\n<p>\"In addition to the method  of procedure authorized for the exercise of the power of eminent domain by sections two hundred and forty-one to  two hundred  and fifty-three, inclusive, of Act Numbered  One  hundred and ninety, entitled 'An Act providing a Code  of Procedure in  civil actions and special proceedings in the Philippine Islands\/ the procedure in this Act provided may be adopted whenever  a railroad corporation seeks to appropriate land for  the construction,extension, or operation of its railroad line.\"  (Act No. 1258, sec. 1.)<\/p>\n<p>\"Whenever a railroad corporation is  authorized  by its charter, or by general law, to exercise the power of eminent domain in the city of Manila or in any province,  and has not obtained by agreement  with  the owners thereof the lands necessary for its purposes as authorized by law, it may in its  complaint,  *   *  *  in the  Court of First Instance of the province where the land is situated, join as defendants all  persons owning or claiming to  own, or occupying, any of the lands sought to be condemned, or any interest therein, within the city or province, respectively, showing, so far as practicable, the interest of each defendant and stating With certainty the right of condemnation, and describing the property sought to be condemned.  <em>Process requiring the  defendants to appear in answer to the complaint shall  be served upon all occupants of the land sought to  be condemned, and upon the owners and all persons claiming interest therein, so far as known.<\/em>  If the title to any lands sought to be condemned appears to be  in the Insular Government, although the lands  are occupied by private individuals, or if it is uncertain whether the title is in the Insular Government or in private individuals, or if the title is otherwise so obscure or doubtful that the company can not with accuracy or certainty specify who are the real owners, averment may be made by the company in its complaint  to  that  effect.  Process shall  be served upon residents and nonresidents in the same manner as provided therefor  in  Act  Numbered  One hundred and  ninety, *  *   *.\"   (Act No. 1258, sec. 3.)<\/p>\n<p>*   *   *  Tne provisions  *  *  *   as to persons not notified of the condemnation proceedings, shall be such as are defined in sections 248 to 253, inclusive, of Act No. 190.\" (Act No. 1258, sec. 5, last five lines.)<\/p>\n<p>\"Nothing herein contained shall be  construed so as to injure, prejudice, defeat, or destroy the estate, right, or title of any person claiming land or any part thereof, or  any interest therein, who was not made a party defendant to the  condemnation proceeding and did not have actual of constructive notice of the proceeding in such  manner as the law requires.\"  (Act No. 190, sec. 253.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The record wholly fails to disclose that process requiring the plaintiff to appear and answer the complaint filed in the condemnation proceedings was served upon her, or upon any of the occupants of the land; and this, notwithstanding the fact, as found by the trial court and practically conceded by counsel  for defendant, that she was the  known  owner of the land, in question.<\/p>\n<p>The statute authorizing the defendant company to exercise the power of eminent domain, being in  derogation of general right and conferring upon it exceptional privileges with regard to the property of others oif which it may have need, should be construed strictly in favor of landowners whose property is affected by its terms.   Hence  before any right to take possession of land under this statute could have been lawfully exercised by the company, the provisions of the statute must have been \"fully and fairly\" complied with. Manifestly, the seizure and occupation of property without first serving process on the owners or occupants  is so gross a violation of one of the most essential conditions precedent prescribed by the statute, that  no  claim by  the company that it is acting or desires to act under the authority of its charter in taking possession oi this property can be  heard by way of defense to an action for damages for the unlawful trespass. The right to take such land, over the objection of the owner, and to  have a fair valuation placed thereon in special proceedings prescribed by law for  that purpose, is made to depend upon the compliance by the company with certain conditions precedent, and of course no rights can or do arise unless such conditions are fully and fairly complied with.  Not only did the defendant company fail to prove in the lower court that it had served process on the owner and the occupants of the land, but it did not even  claim to have done so when its counsel undertook to introduce in evidence the record in the pending condemnation proceedings.  And, indeed, no such claim has at any time been  made on its behalf.<\/p>\n<p>Plaintiff's  evidence  as  to the value  of the land appropriated is not wholly satisfactory but in the absence of any evidence whatever, worthy of the name, to put in doubt the testimony of her witnesses, we do not think that we would be  justified in reversing the findings of fact by the trial judge who arrived at his conclusions after seeing and hearing these witnesses testify.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for defendant company  assigns  among other errors the action  of the  trial judge in excluding certain testimony and insists that the exclusion of these witnesses justifies and  requires the reversal of the judgment of the court below and the return of the record for a new trial. But while we agree with counsel that the trial judge erred in excluding  certain evidence offered by the defendant, we are satisfied  upon a review of the whole record that the result would not have been otherwise had this evidence been admitted,  and we do not think that a reversal should be granted for error of this character.<\/p>\n<p>We think that  the evidence of defendant, including the map,  whereby counsel undertook to show the exact amount of the land of the plaintiff occupied by the roadbed of the railroad; as also the evidence offered touching the  assessed valuation  of the land of the plaintiff should have been admitted for what it was worth.  But we do not think that had this evidence been  admitted, and granting that it would have  been to the effect claimed for it by counsel for the defendant, that the result would have been different.<\/p>\n<p>The conclusion of the trial  judge from the  evidence before him was that the entire tract mentioned in his judgment had been rendered substantially worthless to the plaintiff by the unauthorized occupation of a part of it by the defendant company,  and we do not think that  the  evidence on which he based this conclusion would be affected by proof that only  a part of the tract was actually occupied and retained in  possession.  The theory on which the trial judge correctly proceeded was  that defendant company  having unlawfully taken possession of a part of the tract of land in  question, and by  its operations thereon rendered  the whole tract worthless to the plaintiff,  plaintiff is entitled to abandon the entire tract, and recover damages for  its full value.  So also proof of the assessed  valuation of the land in question, while proper and competent evidence in a case of this  character, is  at best of but very little value in a judicial inquiry as  to its actual market value.  We do not believe  that the weight to  be given the practically undisputed testimony of the witnesses for the plaintiff as to the actual market value  of the land in  question would have been materially affected by proof that this land was assessed at a valuation greatly less than that placed upon it by the trial judge.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed  from should be and is  hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

With this\u00a0 object view all\u00a0 unauthorized use\u00a0 of or traffic in\u00a0 the drug is\u00a0 penalized, the prescribed penalties\u00a0 to be imposed by\u00a0 the\u00a0 courts\u00a0 in their discretion very wide limits.<\/p><p>The exceptionally wide extent\u00a0 of discretion conferred upon the\u00a0 courts the statute clearly indicates the intention of the legislator that in applying these penalties the courts should have in\u00a0 mind, at all times, the primaary object of the law, that is to say the suppression of the vice, as a widespread\u00a0 evil threatening the public welfare; and further, the particular circumstances of each case, and the degree of criminality\u00a0 involved in t particular violation of the statute of which the accused person has been convicted.<\/p><p>Accordingly we have heretofore held that -\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Upon a\u00a0 person\u00a0 who\u00a0 is convicted only of the crime of smoking opium, of having in his possession such a small quantity of the drug\u00a0 as to\u00a0 ju the inference that\u00a0 it was intended merely for his own personal\u00a0 use, the court has always readily affirmed the imposition of the minimum penalty; \"but upon those who\u00a0 attempt\u00a0 to 'exploit the vice' and\u00a0 violate\u00a0 the provisions of\u00a0 the Opium Law for gain,\u00a0 it is deemed proper that, within discretionary limits\u00a0 prescribed by law,\u00a0 a higher and more severe\u00a0 penalty should be imposed.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (U.\u00a0 S. <em>vs. <\/em>Castaneda,\u00a0 18\u00a0 Phil.

but also because of the vicious\u00a0 consequences flowing from the uncertainty as to the severity of the penalties to be imposed upon convicts such cases.\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions\u00a0 of the law touching awards for informers c with them a very real\u00a0 danger\u00a0 of abuses even under the most careful\u00a0 an painstaking administration\u00a0 of justice.\u00a0 With the fact that the danger such\u00a0 abuses\u00a0 is a\u00a0 necessary incident\u00a0 of the law,\u00a0 the\u00a0 courts\u00a0 have nothing\u00a0 to\u00a0 do.\u00a0\u00a0 That\u00a0 is\u00a0 a question for\u00a0 the Legislature,\u00a0 and\u00a0 it duty\u00a0 and prerogative of\u00a0 the legislator\u00a0 to\u00a0 determine whether the advantages derived\u00a0 from\u00a0 these provisions outweigh the danger of the abuses\u00a0 incident\u00a0 to them.\u00a0\u00a0 But it is the duty of the\u00a0 courts\u00a0 to\u00a0 guard against such\u00a0 abuses to\u00a0 the\u00a0 full extent of their power, and to administrative the law so as\u00a0 to reduce them to the minimum.\u00a0 In our opinion the imposition of\u00a0 unequal and at times\u00a0 arbitrarily severe penalties, on\u00a0 persons convicted of\u00a0 smoking\u00a0 opium or\u00a0 of having small\u00a0 quantities of the drug in their possession, is\u00a0 calculated\u00a0 to increase enormously\u00a0 the danger\u00a0 of such abuses, by greatly increasing the facility with which evilly disposed pe enabled to blackmail both\u00a0 the guilty and the innocent with threats of prosecution\u00a0 for violations of the law of this nature.\u00a0 The fear that the courts may impose a long prison sentence,\u00a0 or even an extremely heavy fine on conviction upon a charge of smoking opium, places one who is conscious of guilt practically at the mercy of an informer who demands large sums the price of silence; and the\u00a0 peculiar difficulties confronting an accused person in an attempt to overcome a well laid conspiracy to secure his conviction on such a charge,\u00a0 combined with the fear of\u00a0 such\u00a0 severe penalties\u00a0 may,\u00a0 and we are convinced not infrequently do\u00a0 induce innocent persons, especially those of\u00a0 the Chinese race, to\u00a0 pay tribute to blackmailers, who prey upon their\u00a0 ignorance or their fears.<\/p><p>Our remarks in this connection should not be construed as\u00a0 an\u00a0 attempt t limit or prescribe the\u00a0 discretion of the courts below to\u00a0 impose more s penalties upon opium smokers than that just indicated, where the evidence discloses\u00a0 strong or compelling reasons therefor.\u00a0 Indeed, in a case very recently decided, we affirmed a prison sentence (reduced to three\u00a0 month imposed upon one\u00a0 convicted of\u00a0 smoking opium, where the\u00a0 evidence disclosed\u00a0 that at the time when he was found making use of the drug, others were smoking in his house at his invitation, or at least with his permission, though we gathered from all the surrounding circumstances th the permission to make use of his house for that purpose was not granted for profit or in an attempt to exploit the vice for gain.\u00a0 And in cases it affirmatively appears that the convict, because of inability\u00a0 to pay of P300, would suffer subsidiary imprisonment of more than three months for his failure so to do, we can\u00a0 see no objection to the imposition of months'\u00a0 imprisonment\u00a0 rather than the fine.<\/p><p>In this connection it is proper to add that\u00a0 if provision were made\u00a0 by for the detention and hospital treatment of\u00a0 persons\u00a0 convicted of opium smoking or the use of the drug in any form, with a view to\u00a0 their permanent reform rather than as\u00a0 a\u00a0 punishment for the offense committed, it might and doubtless would be our duty to adopt\u00a0 a different practice in an attempt to give effect to the intent of\u00a0 the legislator.\u00a0\u00a0 The practice actually adopted is based on\u00a0 conditions as they actually exist,\u00a0 under law as it now stands on the statute book. From what has been said, we think it must be very clear that\u00a0 the penalty\u00a0 of banishment\u00a0 upon a domiciled alien upon a\u00a0 second\u00a0 conviction of smoking opium,\u00a0 should\u00a0 no be\u00a0 sustained, in the absence of exceptionally strong and compelling reason for the imposition of so extraordinarily severe a penalty.\u00a0\u00a0 of course, facts disclosed a\u00a0 bold and contumacious\u00a0 defiance of the law of the\u00a0 la by a foreigner who is permitted to reside in the Islands, or if it appeal that an\u00a0 alien,\u00a0 himself a\u00a0 confirmed victim\u00a0 of the habit, was engaged fomenting the vice and encouraging or inducing others to smoke, his deportation would be clearly justified under the law.\u00a0 But the mere fact a domiciled alien, a\u00a0 habitual user of the drug, has been twice convicted its use, does not, in our opinion, necessitate the imposition of a penal would utterly ruin his business,\u00a0 separate him\u00a0 from\u00a0 his\u00a0 wife\u00a0 and\u00a0 ch a case such as that at bar, and expose him to loss and suffering far\u00a0 in excess of those entailed\u00a0 by the\u00a0 sentence which would be imposed upon citizen for a like offense. We do not believe that the legislator intend anticipated that the discretion vested in the courts in cases of\u00a0 this c would be exercised so as to produce such unjust and inequitable consequences.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Yu\u00a0 Quico, 17 Phil. Rep., 625;\u00a0 U.\u00a0 S. Chit, 17 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 647.)<\/p><p>We think that this being the second offense, the penalty to be imposed should be somewhat more severe than that which should\u00a0 be imposed upon a first\u00a0 offender; and that, in this case, the convict\u00a0 should be sentences a\u00a0 prison sentence in addition to a fine.<\/p><p>The judgment of conviction of the lower court is affirmed, but the\u00a0 sent of deportation\u00a0 is reversed, and in\u00a0 lieu thereof\u00a0 the\u00a0 convict is hereby sentenced to three months' imprisonment and to the payment of a fine of P300, with subsidiary imprisonment according to\u00a0 law in the event of insolvency and nonpayment of the fine, and to the payment of the costs i both instances.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

From that time until  about July, 1906, he received at various times money, machinery, and other supplies.  During this  same period he made various payments on his account by turning over to the company's agent  sugar  and other farm  products. On the termination of the business relations between that company and Jeanjaquet, it was found that he was indebted to the said company in the sum of over P55,000.   The company, in the month of August, 1906, instituted an action in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Occidental Negros, in which judgment was asked for the  balance due. Subsequently thereto and on the 1st  of September, 1906, the plaintiff in that action  obtained  an  attachment and placed the same in the hands of the sheriff for execution. The sheriff,  through his deputy, in compliance  with  the order of the court, wherein he was  directed to attach and hold sufficient  of the defendant's property to  cover  the amount of over P55,000 alleged to be due the plaintiff company, proceeded to attach various articles of personal property and six  parcels of land, which he, the sheriff,  was informed belonged to the defendant in that case.  Immediately after the attachment of this property the plaintiff in the case at bar, Arcadia Reynes, filed a protest with the deputy sheriff, claiming to be the exclusive  owner of practically  all of  the property thus attached,  and asked the said deputy sheriff to  dissolve  the attachment.  On the deputy sheriff's refusing to grant her request, she instituted this action, making the sheriff, the deputy sheriff, and the Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas party defendants, and asked the court to declare  that all the property specified in her  protest belonged to her,  and for the dissolution of the attachment in reference to this property.  The sheriff and his deputy having failed to appear and  answer the complaint, judgment by default was entered against them. The defendant company filed  its first answer to  this  complaint on January 19, 1907, in  which it confined itself to denying all of the allegations  in the complaint.  Subsequently thereto and on the 4th of February of  the same year,  the company filed  an  amended  answer. In  this amended  answer the company again denied all the allegations  in the complaint,  and alleged in its cross-complaint that the contract of purchase and sale made  on the  23d of September,  1903, wherein  it appears that the plaintiff purchased a one-half undivided  interest  in the hacienda Providencia from Manuela Daniel, was simulated, the true purchaser being Alfredo Jeanjaquet, and that the said Jeanjaquet entered  into that simulated contract for the purpose of disposing of his property in  order to defraud his creditor, the defendant  company.  The defendant  company prayed the court to include the  said Jeanjaquet in this suit as one of the  defendants; that  said contract of purchase and  sale be declared null and void; and  that the plaintiff be required to pay the costs.  On the 5th  of August of the same year, the defendant  company  filed another amended answer.   In this last amended answer, it  admitted the  allegations set forth in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the complaint, and denied those in paragraphs 4,  5, 6, and  7.  As a special defense, defendant alleged  that  all the property described in the complaint belonged exclusively to Alfredo Jeanjaquet, who was then  indebted to it in the sum of over ^55,000,  and asked the court to absolve it from the complaint and declare that all of said property belonged to the said Jeanjaquet.<\/p>\n<p>After a full consideration  of the proofs presented, the trial court rendered judgment declaring Alfredo Jeanjaquet' to be the owner of a one-half interest in the hacienda Providencia, two  houses, one stable,  and several articles of personal property,  and the plaintiff to be the owner of the other five parcels of land, all of the carabao and cattle, and one sewing machine.  From  this  judgment, both  parties appealed and  presented  separate bills of exceptions.<\/p>\n<p>We think the findings of the trial court, wherein it held that those specified articles of  personal property attached (except the horses, which have since died  and for which counsel for the plaintiff now make no claim) belonged to Alfredo Jeanjaquet, is fully  supported by  the evidence of record.   A discussion upon the ownership of these articles of personal property is unnecessary.<\/p>\n<p>It will be noted that the defendant company, in its second amended answer, alleged fraud  on  the part of the plaintiff and Alfredo Jeanjaquet, but that in  its final amended answer it specifically eliminated this  question.  No allegation of fraud is alleged  in this final  answer, nor are there any allegations from  which  fraud  may be inferred.  Unquestionably, the company had a right to set up fraud on the part of the plaintiff  and Alfredo  Jeanjaquet as a  special defense.   It is nevertheless just as true that it had a perfect right to  eliminate  this  question and rely solely upon  the ownership.  Where pleadings are amended,  the prior pleadings are to be regarded as abandoned.   (39 Cent. Dig. Pleading,  sec. 737|, and cases thereunder.)<\/p>\n<p>An amended complaint  and  the answer thereto, when filed, take  the  place of the originals,  which then cease to perform  any further function as  pleadings.  (People  <em>vs.<\/em> Hunt, 1 Idaho, 433.)<\/p>\n<p>Where issue  is joined  on an. amended petition, the original answer not being made a part of the second answer, the  case stands for trial on the amended pleadings only. (First National Bank vs. Western Union Telegraph Company, 30 Ohio, 555.)   In this case the telegraph company set up a special contract as a defense against a claim for damages.   In the amended answer no reference was made to this special contract.  The court said:<\/p>\n<p>\"In this state of the pleadings, we look to the amended petition and  answer  alone.   Thus, the special  contract is eliminated from the case.\"<\/p>\n<p>Where an amended answer is complete  in itself, it supersedes the  original answer, which no longer remains a part of the record.   (Kuhland vs. Sedgwick, 17 CaL, 123;  White vs. Hampton, 9 Iowa,  181; Olesen vs. Newell, 12 Minn., 186; Wells vs. Applegate,  12 Ore.,  208.)<\/p>\n<p>It is unnecessary to decide in  this case what would have been the result of the question with reference to the pleadings if the defendant company  had presented evidence establishing fraud on the part of the plaintiff and Alfredo Jeanjaquet, and had  that evidence been  admitted without objection on the part of the plaintiff.  The only question to be determined is, who was the owner of the remainder of the property in dispute at  the  time the attachment was executed?<\/p>\n<p>The principal contention between the parties has been in reference to the ownership of the one-half  undivided interest in the hacienda Providencia.  In Exhibit No. 1, which is a  notarial  document  executed on  September 23, 1903, by Manuela Daniel in favor of the  plaintiff, it clearly and specifically appears  that this one-half undivided interest in that  hacienda is the property of  the plaintiff.  It is admitted that Daniel was  the owner of this one-half of  the hacienda, and when she executed this public document, she stated that the sale was made to the plaintiff.  Exhibit 3 is  a  contract executed by Manuela Daniel in favor of the plaintiff on the 18th of August, 1904, extending the time for the payment of the balance due on this  one-half interest in the hacienda.   In 1906 Manuela Daniel brought an action in the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros against this plaintiff to  recover  the balance of the purchase price due on that hacienda and  obtained judgment against this plaintiff for F514.44, together with interest and costs.  This judgment was  satisfied  by the plaintiff, according to the receipt of the clerk of the court.  In the certified  copy of the decision of the court  in that case of Manuela Daniel vs. Arcadia  Reynes, it is established  that the plaintiff in the case at  bar made certain  payments on  that land: on the 29th of September, 1903, she paid P500; in March, 1904, P31.40; in September, 1904, P19.75; and on  November 10, 1904, P636.50.   All of these  partial payments, according to the documentary evidence, were paid by the plaintiff and receipted for by the seller  or  her agent.  Notwithstanding this documentary evidence,  part of which appears in a notarial document, and part in  a solemn judgment of the court, Manuela Daniel testified that this one-half  undivided  interest in  the hacienda Providencia was not sold to the plaintiff but to Alfredo Jeanjaquet.  Such testimony on the part of the seller does not deserve serious consideration, in view of the fact that she herself has stated,  over her own signature,  on various  occasions, that the purchaser  was the plaintiff.  Furthermore,  she  admits, in these  documents, that she  received the money from the  plaintiff; and again, she brought an action against the  plaintiff and did recover from her the balance due on the purchase  price.  After having made all of  these transactions in this manner, it is too late for Manuela Daniel to say, some three  years later, that these documents do not state the truth.<\/p>\n<p>But it is insisted that  Alfredo Jeanjaquet  furnished the plaintiff the money with which this one-half interest in that hacienda was purchased.   Alfredo Jeanjaquet testified that he  has no interest  whatever  in this hacienda.  If he did furnish the money for its purchase (this fact is not proved), the result would be the same,  as he had a right to loan the plaintiff  money or make her a present of it.  The ownership of the two houses and the stable necessarily followed the  ownership of  the one-half undivided interest  in  the hacienda.<\/p>\n<p>We  think the  trial court,  in considering the  testimony with reference to the ownership of the one-half  undivided interest  in  this  hacienda,  failed  to give due  weight and credit  to the documentary evidence presented by  the plaintiff,  especially the  notarial document  of purchase and sale and  the judgment of the court wherein the seller sought to and  did recover the balance of the purchase price from this plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>The findings of fact of  the trial court with reference to the other five parcels of land and  the carabao and cattle are fully supported by the evidence.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment  appealed from should be and  the same is hereby modified by excluding from the real property declared to be  that of Alfredo Jeanjaquet  at  the  time  the attachment was executed, the one-half interest in the hacienda, the two houses, and the stable.   This one-half undivided interest in the hacienda, and the  buildings, are hereby  declared to be the  property of the plaintiff.  As thus modified, the judgment is affirmed, without costs.<\/p>\n<p> <em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Lobingier, judge, found the defendant guilty of the\u00a0 offense of <em>abusos deshonestos<\/em>, as\"\u00a0 defined and punished under article 439 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Penal Code, and\u00a0 sentenced\u00a0 him to\u00a0 be imprisoned for a period of 4 years 6 months and 11 days of <em>prision correccional,<\/em>\u00a0 and to pay the costs.<\/p><p>From that sentence the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 appealed and made the following assignments\u00a0 of\u00a0 error in this court:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"I. The lower court erred in admitting the testimony of the physicians about\u00a0 having taken a certain substance from the body of the accused while he\u00a0 was\u00a0 confined in jail and regarding the chemical analysis made of the substance to demonstrate the physical condition\u00a0 of\u00a0 the accused with reference to a venereal disease.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"II.

The court erred\u00a0 in hojding that the accused was suffering from a venereal disease.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"IV. The court erred in finding the accused guilty from the evidence.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>From an examination of the record it appears that the offended party, Oliva\u00a0 Pacomio, a girl seven years of age, was, on the 15th day of September, 1910,\u00a0 staying\u00a0 in the house, of her sister, located on Ilang-Ilang Street,\u00a0 in the city of Manila; that on said day a number of Chinamen were gambling in or near the said house; that some of said Chinamen had been in the habit of\u00a0 visiting the house of the sister of\u00a0 the offended party; that Oliva Pacomio, on the day in question,\u00a0 after having\u00a0 taken a\u00a0 bath, returned to her room; that the defendant followed her into her room and asked her for some face powder, which she gave him; that after using some\u00a0 of the face powder upon his private parts, he threw the said\u00a0 Oliva upon\u00a0 the floor, placing his private parts upon hers, and remained in that position for some little time.\u00a0 Several days later, perhaps a week or two, the sister of Oliva Pacomio discovered that the latter was suffering from a venereal disease known as gonorrhea. It was at\u00a0 the time of this discovery\u00a0 that Oliva related to her sister what\u00a0 had happened upon the morning of the 15th of September.\u00a0 The sister\u00a0 at once put on foot\u00a0 an investigation to find the Chinaman.\u00a0 A number of Chinamen\u00a0 were collected together.\u00a0 Oliva was called upon to identify the one who had abused her.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant was not present at first.\u00a0\u00a0 Later he arrived and Oliva\u00a0 identified him at once as the one who had attempted\u00a0 to violate her.<\/p><p>Upon this information\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 was arrested and taken to the police station and stripped of his clothing and examined.\u00a0\u00a0 The policeman\u00a0 who\u00a0 examined\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant swore that his body bore every sign of the fact that he was suffering: from the venereal disease known as gonorrhea. The policeman took a portion of the substance emitting from the body of the defendant and turned it over to the Bureau of Science\u00a0 for\u00a0 the purpose\u00a0 of having a\u00a0 scientific analysis made of the same.\u00a0 The result of the examination showed that\u00a0 the defendant was suffering from gonorrhea.<\/p><p>During the trial the defendant objected strongly to the admissibility of the testimony of Oliva, on the ground that because of her tender years her testimony should\u00a0 not\u00a0 be given credit.\u00a0 The lower court,\u00a0 after carefully examining her with reference to her ability\u00a0 to understand the nature of an oath, held that she had sufficient intelligence and discernment to justify\u00a0 the\u00a0 court in accepting her\u00a0 testimony with full faith and credit.\u00a0 With the conclusion of the lower court, after reading her declaration, we fully concur.<\/p><p>The defense\u00a0 in the lower court attempted to\u00a0 show that the venereal disease of gonorrhea might be communicated in ways other than by contact such as is described in the present case, and called medical\u00a0 witnesses for the purpose of supporting\u00a0 that contention.\u00a0 Judge\u00a0 Lobingier,\u00a0 in discussing that question said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"We shall not pursue the\u00a0 refinement of speculation as to whether or not this\u00a0 disease might, in exceptional\u00a0 cases, arise from other than carnal contact.\u00a0 The medical experts, as well\u00a0 as the books, agree that in ordinary cases it arises from\u00a0 that\u00a0 cause,\u00a0 and if this was an exceptional one, we think it was incumbent upon the defense\u00a0 to bring it within the exception,\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The offended party testified that the defendant had rested his private parts upon\u00a0 hers for some moments.\u00a0 The defendant was found to\u00a0 be suffering from gonorrhea.\u00a0 The medical experts who testified agreed that this disease could have been communicated from him to her by the contact described.\u00a0 Believing as we do the story told by Oliva, we are forced\u00a0 to the conclusion that the disease with which Oliva was suffering was the result of the illegal and brutal\u00a0 conduct of the defendant.\u00a0 Proof, however, that Oliva contracted said\u00a0 obnoxious disease from\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 is not necessary to show that he is guilty of\u00a0 the crime.\u00a0\u00a0 It is only corroborative of the truth of Oliva's declaration.<\/p><p>The defendant attempted to\u00a0 prove in\u00a0 the lower court that the prosecution was brought for the purpose of compelling: him to pay\u00a0 to the sister of Oliva a certain sum of money.<\/p><p>The defendant testified and brought other Chinamen to support his declaration, that the sister of Oliva threatened to have him\u00a0 prosecuted if he\u00a0 did not pay her the sum of P60.\u00a0 It seems impossible to believe\u00a0 that the sister, after having become convinced that Oliva had been outraged in the manner described above, would consider for a moment a settlement for the paltry sum of P60.\u00a0 Honest women do not consent to the\u00a0 violation of their bodies nor those of their near relatives, for the filthy consideration\u00a0 of mere money.<\/p><p>In the court below the defendant contended that the result of the scientific examination made by the Bureau of Science of the substance taken from his body, at or about the time he was arrested, was not admissible in evidence as proof of the fact that he\u00a0 was suffering from\u00a0 gonorrhea. That to admit such evidence was to compel the defendant to testify against himself.\u00a0 Judge Lobingier, in\u00a0 discussing that question in his sentence, said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The accused was not compelled to make any admissions or answer any questions, and the mere fact that an\u00a0 object found on his person was examined; seems no more\u00a0 to infringe the rule invoked,\u00a0 than would the introduction in evidence of stolen\u00a0 property taken\u00a0 from the\u00a0 person of\u00a0 a thief.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The substance was taken from the body of the defendant without his objection, the examination was made by competent medical\u00a0 authority and\u00a0 the\u00a0 result showed that\u00a0 the defendant was\u00a0 suffering from said disease. As was suggested by Judge Lobingier, had the defendant been\u00a0 found with stolen property upon his person,\u00a0 there certainly could have been no question had the stolen property been taken for the purpose of using the same as evidence against him. So also if the clothing which he wore,\u00a0 by reason of blood stains\u00a0 or otherwise, had\u00a0 furnished evidence of the commission of a crime, there certainly could have been no objection to taking such for the purpose of using the same as proof. No one would think of even suggesting that stolen property and the clothing in the case\u00a0 indicated,\u00a0 taken from the\u00a0 defendant, could not be used against him as evidence, without violating the rule that a person shall\u00a0 not be\u00a0 required to give testimony against himself.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 question presented by the defendant below and\u00a0 repeated in his first assignment of error\u00a0 is not a new question, either to the courts or authors.\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of Holt <em>vs.<\/em> U. S. (218 U. S., 245), Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the court upon this question, said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"But the prohibition\u00a0 of compelling a man in a criminal court to be a witness against himself, is\u00a0 a prohibition of\u00a0 the use of physical or moral compulsion, to extort\u00a0 communications from him, not an\u00a0 exclusion of his body as evidence, when it may be material.\u00a0\u00a0 The objection, in principle, would forbid a jury\u00a0 (court) to look at a person and compare\u00a0 his features with a photograph in proof.\u00a0 Moreover we are not considering how far a court would go in compelling a man to exhibit himself,\u00a0 for when he is\u00a0 exhibited, whether voluntarily\u00a0 or by order, even\u00a0 if the order goes\u00a0 too far, the evidence if material, is competent.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The question which we are discussing was also discussed by the supreme court\u00a0 of the\u00a0 State of New Jersey, in the case of State<em> vs. <\/em> Miller\u00a0 (71 N.J. Law\u00a0 Reports,\u00a0 527),\u00a0 In that case the court said,\u00a0 speaking through its chancellor:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"It was not erroneous to permit the physician of the jail in which the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 was confined, to\u00a0 testify to wounds observed by him on the\u00a0 back of the hands of the accused, although he also testified that he had the accused removed to a room in another part of the jail and divested of\u00a0 his clothing.\u00a0 The observation\u00a0 made by the witness of the wounds on the hands\u00a0 and testified to\u00a0 by him, was in no sense a compelling of the accused to be a witness against himself.\u00a0 If the removal of the\u00a0 clothes had been forcible and the wounds had been thus exposed, it seems that the evidence of their character and appearance would not have been objectionable.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In that case\u00a0 also (State\u00a0 <em>vs<\/em>. Miller)\u00a0 the defendant was required to place his hand upon the wall of the house where the crime was committed, for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not his hand would have produced the bloody print.\u00a0 The court said, in discussing that question:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"It was not erroneous to permit evidence of\u00a0 the\u00a0 coincidence between the\u00a0 hand of the accused and the bloody prints of a hand upon the wall of the house where\u00a0 the crime was committed, the hand of the accused having been placed thereon at the request of persons who were with him in the house.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>It may be added that a section of the wall containing the blood prints was produced before the jury and the testimony of\u00a0 such\u00a0 comparison\u00a0 was like\u00a0 that held\u00a0 to\u00a0 be proper in another case decided\u00a0 by the supreme\u00a0 court of New Jersey in the case of Johnson <em> vs.<\/em>\u00a0 State (30 Vroom, N. J.\u00a0 Law Reports, 271).\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant caused the prints of the shoes to be made in the sand before the jury, and witnesses who had observed shoe prints in the\u00a0 sand at the place of the commission of\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime were permitted to compare them with what they had observed at that place.<\/p><p>In that case also the clothing of the defendant\u00a0 was\u00a0 used as evidence against him.<\/p><p>To admit the doctrine contended for by the\u00a0 appellant might exclude the testimony of a physician\u00a0 or a medical expert who had been appointed\u00a0 to make observations\u00a0 of a person who plead\u00a0 insanity as\u00a0 a defense, where such medical testimony was against the contention of the defendant. The medical expert\u00a0 must necessarily use the person of the defendant for the purpose\u00a0 of\u00a0 making\u00a0 such\u00a0 examination. (People <em>vs.<\/em> Austin, 199 N. Y.,.446.)\u00a0\u00a0 The doctrine\u00a0 contended for by the appellant\u00a0 would also prevent the courts from\u00a0 making an examination of the body of the defendant where serious personal injuries were alleged to have been received by\u00a0 him.\u00a0\u00a0 The right of the\u00a0 courts in such\u00a0 cases to require an exhibit of the injured parts of the body has been established by a long line of decisions.<\/p><p>The <em>prohibition<\/em> contained in section 5 of the Philippine Bill that a person shall not be compelled to be a witness against himself, <em>is simply a prohibition against legal process to extract from the defendant's own\u00a0 lips, against his will, an admission of his guilt.<\/em><\/p><p>Mr. Wigmore,\u00a0 in his valuable work on evidence, in discussing the question before us, said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"If, in other words, it (the rule)\u00a0 created inviolability not only for\u00a0 his [physical control of his] own vocal utterances, but also for his physical control in whatever\u00a0 form exercised,\u00a0 then it would be possible for a guilty person to shut himself up in his house, with all the tools and indicia of his crime, and defy the authority of the law to employ in evidence anything\u00a0 that might be\u00a0 obtained\u00a0 by forcibly overthrowing his possession and compelling the surrender of the evidential articles - a clear <em>reductio ad absurdum. In\u00a0 other\u00a0 words,\u00a0 it is not merely\u00a0 compulsion<\/em> that is the kernel of the privilege,\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 <em>but testimonial compulsion\" <\/em>(4 Wigmore,\u00a0 sec. 2263.)<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The main purpose of the provision of\u00a0 the Philippine Bill is <em>to prohibit\u00a0 compulsory oral examination of prisoners<\/em> before trial,\u00a0 or upon trial,\u00a0 for the purpose of extorting unwilling confessions\u00a0 or\u00a0 declarations implicating them in the commission of a\u00a0 crime.\u00a0\u00a0 (People <em>vs<\/em>. Gardner, 144 N.Y., 119.)<\/p><p>The doctrine contended for by the\u00a0 appellant would pro- hibit courts from looking\u00a0 at the face\u00a0 of a defendant even, for the purpose of disclosing\u00a0 his identity. Such an application of the\u00a0 prohibition\u00a0 under discussion certainly\u00a0 could not be permitted.\u00a0 Such\u00a0 an inspection\u00a0 of the\u00a0 bodily features by the court or by witnesses,\u00a0 can not\u00a0 violate the privilege granted under the Philippine Bill, because it does not call\u00a0 upon the accused as\u00a0 a witness - it does not call upon the\u00a0 defendant for\u00a0 his testimonial\u00a0 responsibility. Mr. Wigmore\u00a0 says\u00a0 that evidence obtained in this way from the accused, is not testimony by his body but his body itself.<\/p><p>As was said\u00a0 by\u00a0 Judge Lobingier:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The accused was not compelled to make any admission or answer any\u00a0 questions, and the mere fact that an\u00a0 object found upon his body was examined seems no more\u00a0 to infringe the rule invoked than would the\u00a0 introduction of stolen property taken from\u00a0 the person of a thief.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The doctrine contended for by the appellant would also prohibit the sanitary department of the Government from examining the body\u00a0 of persons who are supposed to have some contagious disease.<\/p><p>We believe that the evidence clearly shows that the defendant was suffering from the venereal disease, as\u00a0 above stated, and\u00a0 that through his brutal\u00a0 conduct said disease was communicated to Oliva Pacomio.\u00a0 In a case like the present it is always difficult to\u00a0 secure positive and\u00a0 direct proof.\u00a0\u00a0 Such crimes\u00a0 as the\u00a0 present are generally proved by\u00a0 circumstantial\u00a0 evidence.\u00a0 In cases of rape the\u00a0 courts of law\u00a0 require corroborative proof,\u00a0 for\u00a0 the reason that such crimes are generally committed in secret.\u00a0 In the present case,\u00a0 taking into account the number and\u00a0 credibility of the witnesses, their interest and attitude on the witness stand, their manner\u00a0 of testifying and the general circumstances\u00a0 surrounding\u00a0 the witnesses, including the fact that both parties were found to be suffering\u00a0 from a common disease, we are of the opinion that the defendant did, on or about the 15th\u00a0 of September, 1910, have such relations as above described with the said Oliva Pacomio, which\u00a0 under the provisions of article 439 of the Penal\u00a0 Code\u00a0 makes him guilty of ,the crime\u00a0 of\u00a0 <em>\"abusos deshonestos<\/em>,\" and taking into consideration\u00a0 the fact\u00a0 that the crime which the defendant committed was\u00a0 done in the house\u00a0 where\u00a0 Oliva Pacomio was living,\u00a0 we are of the opinion that the maximum penalty of the law should be imposed.\u00a0 The maximum penalty provided for by law is six years of <em>prision\u00a0 correccional<\/em>.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore let a judgment be entered modifying the sentence of the lower court and sentencing the defendant to be\u00a0 imprisoned for a period of\u00a0 six years of\u00a0 <em>prision correccional<\/em>, and to pay\u00a0 the costs.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em> Arellano,\u00a0 C.

SIMPLICIO DEL ROSARIO, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, AND  DOROTEO JOSE, DEFENDANTS.\n  <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"><p>One Doroteo Jose, a resident of the city of Manila, had a contract with the Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company, by virtue of which Jose received, and the Light Company furnished electricity for lighting purposes for several years.   The Light Company suspected Jose of unlawfully appropriating electric current, by the use of a device whereby the meter installed in Josh's residence failed to register all the current used by  him. A criminal complaint charging Jose with this offense, was dismissed, and Jose\" acquitted of the offense with which he was charged.  Thereafter the Light Company presented a bill to Jose\" for the amount which it claimed he was indebted to it on account of the electricity which it alleged  in the criminal  complaint  had been unlawfully appropriated  by  him,  and  upon Jose's refusal to pay the bill, the company cut the wire connecting Jose's residence with its power house, and  refused thereafter to furnish electric current  to Jose,  unless and until its  claim for current  which  it alleges  was unlawfully appropriated by him is paid.<\/p>\n<p>Thereupon Jose filed  a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Manila,  praying for a writ of mandamus to compel the Light Company to furnish him with electricity under his contract with the  company; and under the rules, regulations, ordinances  and laws under and by virtue of which the Light Company is operating in the city of Manila; and procured, ex parte,  the issuance of a preliminary mandatory injunction directing the  Light Company to continue furnishing electricity to Jose upon the terms and conditions set forth in the  complaint, pending the final determination of the mandamus proceedings.<\/p>\n<p>The Light Company is now before us, praying that a writ of certiorari issue to the judge of the court below who granted  the preliminary mandatory  injunction, on  the ground  that in  doing so he exceeded his jurisdiction, or rather that he was without jurisdiction to issue an injunction of this nature.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the  Light Company bases his contentions in this court strictly on his  proposition that the Courts of First Instance in these Islands are wholly without jurisdiction to issue preliminary mandatory injunctions under any circumstances whatever; and in open court he waived all objections based on other alleged defects and informalities in the proceedings had in the court below.<\/p>\n<p>'Counsel's contention appears to be that the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure touching the issue of preliminary injunctions do not contemplate the granting of preliminary mandatory injunctions, and that in the absence of express statutory authority the courts of these Islands have no jurisdiction to issue such injunctions.<\/p>\n<p>This  contention cannot be maintained.  Modeled  as  are our courts and indeed our whole judicial system upon  Anglo-American precedents, we are of opinion that the power to grant preliminary injunctions, both preventative and mandatory,  is a logical  and necessary  incident of the general powers  conferred upon  Courts of  First Instance in these Islands as courts of record of general and unlimited original jurisdiction both legal and equitable. to secure the rights of the litigants in actions  pending in these courts it may, and often does become necessary to preserve the status quo of the parties or of the subject matter in litigation.  To this end the power to grant  preliminary injunctions, where no other adequate remedy is provided in the ordinary course of law, is an important and, if complete justice  is to be done between the parties, a  necessary incident  of the general jurisdiction conferred upon these courts.  Of course, in so far as the statute limits or prescribes the exercise of this power it must be followed; but beyond this, and in cases not covered or contemplated by the statute, our courts must exercise their jurisdiction in the issuance of preliminary injunctions upon sound principles applicable  to the circumstances of each particular case, having  in mind the nature of the remedy, and  the  doctrine established in the  courts upon which our judicial  system is based, <\/p>\n<p>Section 55 of Act No. 136, in express  terms confers upon Courts of First Instance the jurisdiction to  grant writs of injunction generally, but prescribes that they shall be issued in the <em>\"manner\"<\/em> provided in the Code of Civil Procedure. The  <em>\"method\"<\/em> of obtaining preliminary injunctions generally is set forth in section 166 of Act No. 190, the Code of Civil Procedure; and while there is ground for the contention that the legislator in prescribing that method had in mind the granting of preliminary preventative injunctions only, we think that it provides at the same time the <em>\"manner\"<\/em>  in  which  preliminary  mandatory injunctions should be obtained. As we have said already, the power to issue injunctions generally, including, as we hold,  mandatory as well as preventative injunctions, is not only a logical and essential incident of the general and unlimited equitable and  legal jurisdiction conferred upon Courts of First Instance, but is expressly  conferred upon them  under the provisions  of  section 55  of Act No. 136,  with the single proviso, that this jurisdiction is to be exercised in the manner provided in the Code of Civil Procedure.  It follows that whether or not the code in express terms provides the manner for the issuance  of a particular class of injunctions, jurisdiction to issue such injunctions must be maintained, if the manner in which such injunctions  may be  issued can fairly be inferred from the general provisions of the code, or from its  provisions for the issuance of injunctions generally.<\/p>\n<p>It  may be admitted that since an injunction mandatory in its nature usually tends to do more than to maintain the <em>status quo<\/em>, it is generally improper to issue such an injunction  prior to the final hearing: but on the other hand,  in cases of extreme urgency; where the right is very clear; where considerations of relative inconvenience bear strongly in complainant's favor; where there is a willful and unlawful invasion of plaintiff's right against his protest and remonstrance, the injury being a continuing one; and where the effect of the mandatory injunction is rather to reestablish and maintain a preexisting continuing relation between the parties, recently  and arbitrarily interrupted  by the defendant, than to establish a new relation, we hold that the jurisdiction to grant  such injunctions undoubtedly exists; and while caution must be exercised in their  issuance, the writ should not be denied the complainant when he makes out a clear case, free from doubt and dispute.<\/p>\n<p>We agree with counsel  for petitioner that a mandatory preliminary injunction should not issue where mandamus proceedings in  themselves furnish an adequate remedy; or indeed in .any case where adequate relief for the threatened injury will be furnished by an action at law or where adequate means of redress are in the hands of the complainant without the need for its issuance. But cases do and will arise wherein no adequate remedy  exists  other  than the issuance of a preliminary mandatory injunction, and we think the case at bar furnishes an excellent illustration of a considerable class of such cases.<\/p>\n<p>Where a public service corporation which has acquired a substantial monopoly of the supply of light, power, water, transportation  or the like, undertakes arbitrarily,  and in manifest defiance and violation of the laws, ordinances and regulations under and by virtue of which it operates, to discriminate against one of those dependent upon it for the supply of such necessaries, and without just cause or excuse, arbitrarily and in manifest violation of a continuing duty imposed upon it by law and its  own contracts,  ceases to furnish such necessaries under such conditions that a mandamus will lie to compel it to do so, we think there  can be no doubt that pending the final determination of the mandamus proceedings the court wherein such proceedings are pending has jurisdiction to issue a temporary mandatory injunction in a case where the injury complained of is a continuing one and  where the invasion of the rights of the  complainant during  the  pendency of  the  proceedings  would  work  a serious injury for which there is no other adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.<\/p>\n<p>The undisputed facts in the case at bar  clearly disclose that the Light Company has no valid claim against Jose on account of electricity furnished or received by him; that its action in refusing to continue to furnish electricity to his residence constitutes an arbitrary invasion of his rights, in open violation of the laws, regulations and ordinances under which the company operates; that the continued refusal to furnish electricity  pending  the  mandamus  proceedings instituted in the court below would result in serious injury to Jose for which he has no other adequate remedy than a preliminary mandatory injunction; and that the court below had therefore jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction complained of.<\/p>\n<p>The petition in this case should be and is therefore dismissed, with the costs against the petitioner.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

About 2 months after the sale of the said property a deputy of the defendant herein, who claimed to be acting under the. instructions of the defendant, attempted to\u00a0 and did retake from the possession\u00a0 of\u00a0 the plaintiff herein that portion of the property sold under said execution described in Exhibits A and B for the purpose of reselling the same. All of this\u00a0 was done against the protest of the plaintiff. No reason appears in the record why the defendant, through his deputy, desired to repossess himself of the property sold under said execution. There is nothing in the record which shows that the sale\u00a0 under said execution was irregular in any manner.\u00a0 As soon as\u00a0 possible after the\u00a0 defendant, through his deputy, had retaken possession of the said property, the plaintiff commenced the present action here for the purpose of prohibiting the defendant from reselling the same.<\/p><p>The defendant presented no order of the court, or authority of any kind or nature, at the time he retook possession of said property for the purpose of\u00a0 reselling the same, justifying\u00a0 his action.\u00a0 What the defendant did seems to have been absolutely unauthorized in any way.\u00a0 So\u00a0 far as the record shows the sale of said property under the execution was entirely regular.\u00a0 The sale seems to have been legal.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no explanation in the record which justifies the action\u00a0 of the defendant.\u00a0 Even though the defendant had attempted to retake possession of the property,\u00a0 annulling the sale under the execution, by virtue of an order of the court\u00a0 which rendered the judgment and which issued the said execution, his authority so to do would have been very doubtful.\u00a0\u00a0 (Perez <em>vs<\/em>.

Rep., 112; Sections 461, 462 and 463 of Act No. 190.)<\/p><p>When personal property is sold under an execution, such sale conveys to the purchaser all the right which the\u00a0 debtor had in such property on the day the execution or attachment was levied.\u00a0 The purchaser becomes the absolute owner of personal property sold under an execution\u00a0 at the time of the sale and delivery of the same.\u00a0 (Section 461 of Act 190; Perez <em>vs<\/em>.

M. Ibanez de Aldecoa,  against Aldecoa &amp;  Co., in liquidation, and Isabel Palet y Gabarr6, the said company of  Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, were sentenced to pay to the aforenamed three plaintiffs the sum of P155,127.31 Philippine currency, in the proportion that pertained to each of them in accordance with the investment made in the said company by Isabel Palet y Gabarro, in February, 1897,  of P204,184.74, in addition to 6 per cent interest per annum from May 16, 1908, until its complete payment, and to pay the costs, and the defendant Isabel  Palet y Gabarro was absolved from the complaint, (Exhibit A.)<\/p>\n<p>On November 30,  1909, counsel for the plaintiffs, the said Joaquin, Zoilo, and Cecilia Ibanez de Aldecoa, filed a written complaint, amended on January 4,  1910, against the company, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, and  William  Urquhart,  the liquidator of the said company, Aldecoa &amp;  Co'., in liquidation, wherein he alleged  that, by the judgment aforementioned of September 30, 1908, the said sum of P155,127.31, with interest and costs, was  awarded to the said plaintiffs, a copy of which judgment was  exhibited under letter \"A\" and  its contents were made an integral part  of the complaint; that, there having been issued the required writ of execution, by reason of the said final judgment, proceedings were had for the attachment of all  the property owned by Aldecoa &amp; Co., and that, as a  result of the processes of execution counsel for the plaintiffs  succeeded in collecting only the sum of P17,022.28, there still remaining a judgment debt in the latter's favor  of P149,492.77, in addition to  the 6 per cent interest per annum on this sum from August 10, 1909, the date of the last execution; that, on August 14, 1907, the defendant Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, acquired, through  its liquidator Urquhart, the ownership of certain shares or certificates of stock of the company \"Pasay Estate Co., Ltd.,\" numbered 65 to 97, inclusive, in payment or satisfaction of a credit which Aldecoa &amp; Co., had against Alejandro Macleod, the previous owner of the said certificates, all according to the public instrument executed by the parties on the said date of August 14, 1907, a  copy of which, marked as Exhibit B, was attached to the record and its contents made an integral part of this allegation; that, according to the plaintiffs' information, the said certificates  of  shares of \"The  Pasay Estate Co., Ltd.\" the property of Aldecoa &amp; Co., were then in the possession and custody of  the defendant,  The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which claimed a right of  retention over the  said certificates by virtue of a certain agreement between  its director and manager  and the liquidator of Aldecoa &amp; Co., an agreement recorded  in  a public instrument,  a  copy of which, exhibited under  letter \"C,\"  was attached to  the record and its contents formed an integral part of  this allegation; that the power or authority by virtue of which the liquidator Urquhart apparently  had the capacity  to execute  the said agreement,  is  specified in a record of proceedings containing the resolutions adopted by the company aforementioned, a copy of which record, exhibited under the letter \"D,\" is attached to the papers in this case and its contents formed an integral part of the complaint; that the  defendant,  William Urquhart, lacked the express authorization of the members of the company and of the law, as well as the power  and authority as liquidator to  execute the said agreement, Exhibit C, which, on the contrary, was explicitly  prohibited  by the law, was a violation of the provisions thereof, and, consequently,  was a contract null and void in itself,  inoperative and without value or  effect, because it tended to  convert the defendant bank into an exceptionally privileged creditor with prejudice and fraud toward the other creditors of Aldecoa &amp; Co., among  whom were the plaintiffs.  The  latter,  on these grounds, petitioned the  court,  in the  supplementary proceedings of execution of that final judgment,  to order the company, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, to  deposit the said certificates with the court  and that the same be sold at public auction in order to apply the product of the sale to the said judgment; but The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank opposed the  said petition on the ground that, by reason of the contract, Exhibit C,  the said certificates had been delivered by the liquidator of Aldecoa &amp; Co. to the bank as an additional security to that previously given in behalf of the same by Aldecoa &amp; Co. to guarantee the payment of a credit which the former, the defendant bank, held against the latter.<\/p>\n<p>The court denied the  plaintiffs'  petition, but authorized them to bring the proper action  for the  recovery of the said certificates.  Counsel for the plaintiffs,  therefore, asked for a judgment in behalf of his clients, against the defendants, by finding: (a) That the agreement contained  in the document, Exhibit  C,  executed by  the liquidator Urquhart in favor of The Hongkong and Shanghai  Bank, was in itself null and  void; (b) that the  certificates, Nos. 65 to 97, of The Pasay Estate Co., Ltd., belonged  to Aldecoa &amp; Co., and that the said bank did not acquire and did not have any title, right or interest whatever in the said certificates; and  (c) that the sheriff of Manila should take  possession of the said certificates and sell them in execution of the judgment rendered in the civil case No. 6087 of the  Court of First  Instance.<\/p>\n<p>The demurrer interposed by  counsel  for The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank against the complaint having been overruled by an order of February 10, and an exception  thereto taken by the said bank,<em> counsel for Aldecoa &amp; Co.,<\/em> in liquidation, <em>in its answer to the previous complaint,<\/em> denied each and all of the allegations therein contained.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, answering the previous amended complaint by a writing of February 17, 1910, set forth a general and special denial of each and all of the allegations contained in the said amended complaint and, by a second distinct and separate answer, stated and alleged that he admitted the allegations  contained in paragraphs 1,  2, 3, and 4 of the amended complaint and denied each and all of the other allegations of the same; that, on  January 24, 1907, a meeting was held of the members of the firm of Aldecoa &amp; Co. for the purpose of deciding upon the ways and means of effecting the liquidation of the said company, in which meeting the members decided upon the matter of the liquidation, as shown by the minutes and the registration of the same in the mercantile registry book of the firm, a copy of the said minutes being attached, containing the  resolution referred to, which, as Exhibit A, was made an integral part of the answer; that, subsequent to <em>June 13,1907,<\/em> on which date the said firm was in course of liquidation,; <em>a certain agreement was made and executed<\/em> by and between Joaquin and Zoilo Ibanez de Aldecoa y Palet, and Isabel Palet y Gabarro, the widow of  Aldecoa,  all parties of the first part, the firm of Aldecoa &amp;  Co., in liquidation, parties of the second part, and the firm of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, party of the third part, by which agreement the parties of the first and second parts stipulated that  they would apply, in their totality to the payment <em>pro tanto<\/em> of the credit which Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, was owing to the  party  of the third part, all  the products of a certain suit which was about to be brought by  Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, against Alejandro S. Macleod re several shares of the company, \"The Pasay Estate Co., Ltd.,\" which shares were those numbered 65 to 97, referred to in the complaint, <em>a copy of the said agreement, marked as Exhibit B,<\/em> being attached to and made a part of the answer; that, on August 14, 1907, after suit had been filed by Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation,  against Alejandro S. Macleod re the said shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co.,  Ltd.,\" <em>a compromise<\/em>  was had, shown in  a document executed between the parties on the said 14th day of August; that, on the same date, Aldecoa &amp; Co. executed jointly with The  Hongkong and Shanghai Bank a written agreement whereby it was expressly stipulated that nothing contained in the instrument of compromise  should be considered or construed as a modification, novation, rescission or revocation of a contract duly executed on <em>June 13, 1907,<\/em> a copy of which, marked <em>Exhibit B,<\/em> was  attached to the answer, by which contract or agreement Aldecoa &amp; Co. recognized and confirmed its obligation to deliver the shares aforementioned, together with their dividends, to The Hongkong and Shanghai  Bank in accordance with the terms of the said  agreement, there being attached  the instrument of agreement of August 14,1904, marked Exhibit C, and which was made an integral part of the said separate answer; that, on  August  30,  1907, by virtue of  the said  agreements, Aldecoa &amp;  Co.,  in  liquidation, executed  an instrument whereby it pledged the said shares of the company  \"The Pasay Estate Co., Ltd.,\"  numbered 65 to 97, to The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, a copy of the said instrument being attached, under Exhibit D, and  made an integral part of the answer; and that, at the date of the answer and  at all times since August 30, 1907, The Hongkong  and Shanghai Bank was holding and keeping, and had held and kept, in its possession the said shares,  for the purposes of the mortgage contained in the instrument marked Exhibit D, which mortgage had never been formally cancelled, rescinded or revoked and was still valid and  in force. Counsel for the defendant bank therefore prayed that judgment  be rendered by absolving his client from the amended complaint and sentencing the plaintiffs to  the  payment of the costs of the suit.<\/p>\n<p>On  Apirl 11,  1910, counsel for the plaintiffs presented a written motion for  an amendment to the  complaint,  previously amended on the 4th  of January of the same year, by adding to paragraph 1 thereof the following statement: The plaintiff <em>Zoilo Ibanez de Aldecoa<\/em> was during the entire year 1907 a minor <em>23 years of age<\/em> and had no guardian for   his property nor was provided with any legal representation for the administration, alienation or disposal of his property and interests.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant, The  Hongkong and  Shanghai Banking Corporation, interposed a demurrer to the second amended complaint, alleging that the facts set forth therein did not. constitute a right of action against it, and therefore prayed that it be  absolved from the complaint, with the  costs against the adverse party.  This demurrer was overruled by an order of April 18 of the same year and an exception was entered by the defendant bank.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the latter, in answer to the second amended complaint, set forth in a writing of April 18, 1910: that he generally and specifically denied each and all of the allegations contained in the said second amended complaint, and the latter in its entirety, and that, by a second separate and distinct answer, he denied each and all of the allegations contained in the first paragraph of the second amended complaint; and, answering particularly  with respect to the subject matter of the said first paragraph, he alleged:  that, prior to June 13, 1907, to wit, in 1903, the plaintiff  Zoilo Ibanez de  Aldecoa was  duly and legally emancipated  by his mother and was, by virtue of such emancipation, on the date aforesaid of  June 13, 1907, qualified to manage his property,  as if he were of age;  that the defendant  bank admitted the allegations contained in the second, third and fourth paragraphs  of the said second amended complaint and denied all the other allegations of the latter; that,  on January 24,1907, a meeting was held of the members of the firm of Aldecoa and Company for the purpose of determining upon the ways and means of effecting its liquidation,  in which meeting such members passed various resolutions,  as shown  by the minutes of the meeting  and the registered record  of the same in the mercantile register of this  city, a copy of which was attached to the original answer, marked as Exhibit A and made an integral part of this answer;  that, subsequent to the date aforecited of June 13,  on which the firm of Aldecoa &amp; Co. was in the course of liquidation, a certain agreement was made and executed between Joaquin Ibanez de Aldecoa y Palet, Zoilo Ibanez de Aldecoa y Palet, and Isabel Palet y Gabarro, the widow of Aldecoa, all parties of the first part, Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, party of the second part and The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, party of the third part, by which agreement it was stipulated  by the interested parties of  the  first and the second parts that they would devote in their entirety to the payment <em>pro tanto<\/em> of  the credit which Aldecoa &amp;  Co., in liquidation, was owing to the entity, the party of the third part, all the products  of  the suit which was about to  be brought by Aldecoa &amp; Co. against Alejandro S. Macleod re several shares of the company known as \"The Pasay Estate Co.  Ltd.,\" which were referred to in the complaint and marked as Exhibits Nos. 65 to 97, inclusive, a copy of the said agreement being  attached, under  Exhibit  B,  to the original answer and made an integral part of this answer to the  second amended complaint; that, on August 14, 1907, after Aldecoa &amp; Co. had instituted suit against  Alejandro S. Macleod  in  re the  said  shares of \"The Pasay  Estate Co. Ltd.,\" a compromise therein was reached, according to an agreement made on the same date between the litigating parties; that, on the same  date of August 14, 1907, Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, made a written agreement with The Hongkong and  Shanghai Banking Corporation, whereby it was expressly stipulated that nothing contained in the said instrument of compromise should be considered or construed as a modification, novation, rescission or revocation of the contract duly executed  on June 13, 1907, a copy of  which, as Exhibit B, was attached to this answer, in which contract Aldecoa &amp; Co.,  in liquidation, recognized and  confirmed its obligation to deliver the shares referred to and their corresponding dividends, to The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, a copy of the said agreement of August 14, 1904, marked Exhibit C, being attached to the original answer and made an integral part of this  one; and that, on August 30, 1907, by virtue of the aforementioned agreements, Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, executed  an instrument whereby it pledged    the said shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co. Ltd.,\" designated as Exhibits Nos. 65 to 97, inclusive, to the entity, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, a copy of the said instrument of August 30,1907, being annexed, as Exhibit D, to the original answer and made an integral part of this one.  Counsel for the bank therefore asked that judgment be rendered by absolving his client from the second amended complaint and sentencing the  plaintiffs to the payment of the costs of the suit.<\/p>\n<p>The case having come to trial, the documents, papers and records of proceedings presented in  evidence by the parties being attached to the record, the court, on August 31, 1910, pronounced judgment wherein he found that the agreement was null and  void which on June 30 (it should be August), 1907, was executed by William Urquhart, as the  liquidator of Aldecoa &amp; Co., and by which a pledge, or mortgage as termed in the judgment, was, as an additional security for the credit of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation against Aldecoa &amp; Co., constituted upon the said shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co. Ltd.;\" declared and  recognized to belong to the latter company by virtue of the instrument of compromise e'xecuted by Alejandro S. Macleod on August 14, 1907, which certificates or shares were delivered over to the said  bank for their keeping and  preservation.  The judgment further ordered that the said bank should deliver the said certificates to the sheriff of Manila, as assets of Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, susceptible of judgment execution, without prejudice to any right of preferred  claim thereto which might be raised between the parties upon different and distinct grounds from those argued in the present suit.  No  special assessment was made of the  costs.  To this judgment an exception was entered by the defendant, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which, by written motion,' prayed for the  annulment of the said judgment and a  new trial, on the ground that the former was not supported by the  evidence, was contrary to law, and the findings  of fact therein contained were openly and manifestly at variance with the evidence.  This motion was overruled by an order of December 1st of the same year, and an exception thereto was saved by the defendant party who duly filed the proper  bill  of exceptions  which was certified  and forwarded, with a transcript of the evidence, to the clerk of this court.<\/p>\n<p>Various are the  questions of fact and of law  which have been the subject matter of argument in this  litigation, but, restricting ourselves to the terms of the complaint and of the judgment appealed from, the main issue  which this court is called upon to decide in this instance is that as to whether  or not the agreement contained in the instrument designated as Exhibit  C by  the  plaintiiff  party and  as Exhibit D by the defendant party, executed  on August 30, 1907, by and between the liquidator of the firm of Aldecoa &amp; Co. and the maiiager of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, should be annulled.<\/p>\n<p>The  said  instrument sets forth as the reasons  for  its execution that on  February 23,  1906, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Aldecoa &amp; Co. entered into a contractual agreement whereby the said bank bound itself to  open and maintain in behalf of Aldecoa &amp; Co. a credit in account current up to the sum of P475,000,  in accordance with the conditions and securities detailed in  an instrument of the said date; that,  subsequently, the contracting  parties also agreed that, should certain shares  of the concern,  \"The  Pasay Estate Co. Ltd.,\" be declared  to belong to Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, the same should  be by the latter turned over to the creditor bank, as security; and that, in  view of the fact that the said shares had come into the  ownership of Aldecoa &amp;  Co., in liquidation, the contracting  parties had stipulated  that  Aldecoa &amp;  Co.,  in liquidation, represented by William Urquhart, should transfer and mortgage  to The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation,  as mortgage creditor, the said  shares delivered to it for their custody and preservation, which mortgage was executed  as an additional security  to the said creditor bank for the  payment of any sums which   Aldecoa &amp; Co. might be found to owe it,  by reason of the aforesaid credit in account current or of any other sums which Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, might owe it; that the creditor bank was authorized  to collect and receive all the dividends, bonuses or other distribution of the capital and profits of the said concern, \"The Pasay Estate Co. Ltd.,\" until a total  settlement of the said debt should have been made,  but  that,  should  the mortgage debtor, its heirs, successors in  interest, or administrators pay to the creditor bank all the  amount owed, this obligation  would thereby become null and void; that the right was reserved to Aldecoa &amp; Co. to sell  the said shares, provided that  the product of their sale be  devoted to the payment of its debt; that The Hongkong and  Shanghai Banking Corporation  acknowledged receipt of the said shares for their keeping and preservation,  and that this instrument was held by the contracting parties  to be additional to each and all of tjiose already executed, on account of the debt of Aldecoa &amp; Co., between the latter and The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking  Corporation, which instruments were declared to  be subsistent and in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>Before  proceeding to examine  the agreement referred to and  contained in the  instrument of August 30, 1907, and  to ascertain whether or not it complies with the conditions  required by  law, or whether  it  bears vices  and defects productive of nullity and such as substantially affect the validity and force of the  contract therein stipulated, it becomes necessary to determine whether  the plaintiffs, Zoilo,  Joaquin,  and  Cecilia Ibanez de Aldecoa,  have or have not  the  personality  and rights requisite to enable. them to claim  the nullification of the aforementioned agreement made and  entered into, according to the instrument of August 30, 1907. <br\/>\n<br\/>\n  Article 1300 of the Civil Code provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Contracts containing the requisites mentioned in article 1261 may be annulled, even  when there  should be no lesion, to the contracting parties,  whenever they contain any of the  defects which invalidate them  according  to law.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Article 1302 of the same code prescribes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The  action  for nullity of  contracts may  be brought by those who are  principally or subsidiarily obligated by virtue thereof.   Persons with  capacity can not, however, allege the incapacity of those with whom they  contracted; neither those who  caused the intimidation or violence, or employed deceit, or caused the error, can base their action on these defects of the contract\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The provisions of the article just above quoted have connection with those  of article 1257 of the same  code which reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Contracts shall  only be valid between the parties who execute  them and  their heirs,  except,  with regard  to the latter, the case in which the rights and obligations arising from the contract  are not transmissible, either by their nature, or by agreement, or by provision of law.<\/p>\n<p>\"Should the contract contain any  stipulation in1 favor of a third person, he may demand its fulfillment, provided he has given notice of its acceptance to the person bound before it may have been revoked.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>From  these legal provisions it is deduced that it is the interest  had in  a given contract, that is the determining reason of the right which lies  in favor of the  party obligated  principally or subsidiarily  to enable him to bring an action for the  nullity of the contract in  which  he intervened,  and,  therefore, he who has no right in a contract is not entitled to prosecute an action for nullity, for, according to the precedents established by the  courts, the person who is not a party to a contract, nor has any cause of action or representation from those who intervened therein, is manifestly without right of action and personality such as to  enable him  to  assail  the validity of the  contract. (Decisions of the  supreme court of  Spain,  of April 18, 1901, and November 23,  1903, pronounced in cases requiring an  application of the, preinserted article 1302  of the Civil Code.)<\/p>\n<p>He who is not the .party obligated  principally or subsidiarily in  a contract may perhaps  be entitled  to exercise ah action  for nullity,  if  he is  prejudiced  in his rights with  respect  to  one of the  contracting parties;  but,  in order that such  be the case, it  is  indispensable to show the detriment which positively would result to him from the contract in which he had no intervention.<\/p>\n<p>It is evident  that the plaintiffs,  the Aldecoas,  had no participation,  nor are parties interested or obligated, principally  or  subsidiarily,  in the contract  recorded  in the instrument of August  30,  1907.  The two  sole contracting parties who made the agreement contained in the said instrument, are  Aldecoa &amp; Co., through its liquidator, and The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, represented by its agent arid director, as may be seen by a mere perusal of the Exhibit C D.<\/p>\n<p>Neither  is it  shown that the  said contract of  August 30, 1907, is detrimental or  prejudicial to the rights and interests of the  plaintiffs,  and the latter therefore,  lack absolutely the personality and rights to have been  enabled to prosecute the proper action in demand  of the  nullity of the contract in question executed  between the liquidator of Aldecoa &amp; Co.  and the agent of  The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.    .<\/p>\n<p>It is alleged in the complaint, as  a ground for the petition for nullity  of the  contract of August 30, 1907, page 48 of the bill of exceptions, that the  said agreement was executed by the defendant  William Urquhart, the liquidator of the firm of Aldecoa &amp;  Co., without  the  express authorization  of the members of the latter,  nor of the law, and without his having the power or authority to make the same,  arid that, on the  contrary, the said agreement is expressly prohibited  by, and is a violation of, the law, and, consequently, is a contract in  itself void, without value or effect, because it  made The Hongkong and Shanghai  Bank, the defendant, an exceptionally privileged creditor to the fraud and  prejudice  of the other creditors of Aldecoa &amp; Co., among whom are the plaintiffs.<\/p>\n<p>The latter entered into the contract of June 13, 1907, contained in an  instrument of the same date (page 43 of the bill of exceptions), together with  the liquidator of Aldecoa &amp; Co., and the agent of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, by virtue of which contract they, the plaintiffs, excepting Cecilia Y. de  Aldecoa, and the said liquidator stipulated  with the representative  of the bank that  the  products  of the suit  against Alejandro  S.  Macleod in re shares of \"The  Pasay Estate  Co. Ltd.\" in the event of a favorable  judgment being obtained by Aldecoa &amp; Co., would be devoted in their totality to the satisfaction of the credit which the said firm was owing The Hongkong  and Shanghai Bank, with the only deduction therefrom  of the necessary expenses and the fees of its attorneys, and that  in case the said bank should  incur  liability on account of the P50,000 bond  given by it in the said suit, the obligation on the part of Aldecoa &amp; Co. to indemnify the bank  for such liability should constitute an additional debt to be aggregated to the amount of  the credit which the former was owing the latter and the payment of which was secured by the mortgages drawn  up in the instrument executed by the plaintiffs and Aldecoa &amp; Co., on February 23, 1906.<\/p>\n<p>It  is strange  that the plaintiffs,  who  authorized  and subscribed the said instrument of June 13, 190.7, in which record was made of the aforementioned agreement  and of the said obligations and  liabilities, should now impugn and seek  the nullification of the subsequent  instrument of August 30 of the  same year when The Hongkong  and Shanghai  Bank, renouncing the benefits of the  agreement contained in the said instrument of  June 13,  wherein it was stipulated that the shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co. Ltd.,\" should be delivered to it in payment or partial satisfaction of its considerable credit of P475,000, was satisfied, in the said subsequent instrument of August 30, to  receive the said shares in pledge, for their custody and preservation  as  an  additional  security  for  the  aforementioned credit and an amplification of the security given  in  the mortgage of February 23, 1906, executed by Aldecoa &amp; Co. and by these very plaintiffs.<\/p>\n<p>The latter have not impugned the agreement of June 13, 1907, into which they entered and became interested parties obligated to comply with the stipulations thereof, although the said agreement contains more positive advantages  in behalf of The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, and had it been carried out the plaintiffs would perhaps not have had so much as a hope of collecting their credit against Aldecoa &amp; Co.  out of the value of those shares, because then this firm would  have ceased absolutely to be the owner of the said shares  of \"The Pasay Estate Co. Ltd.\"  The plaintiffs seek the nullification of the subsequent contract of August 30, whereby the  creditor bank was  satisfied to keep as a pledge the said shares, and allege incalculable injury which has no reason for existence, for, though the right they have to collect the sum of P149,422.77 out of the assets of Aldecoa &amp;  Co. is  founded on the final judgment  rendered on September 30, 1908, in case No.  6087 prosecuted  by them against Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation,  and Isabel Palet y Gabarro, yet it must be taken into account that in the case just cited the representative of The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank was not a party and did not intervene, and that the mortgage credit  of this  latter concern against  Aldecoa &amp; Co.  and the plaintiffs is set forth in an instrument of February 23, 1906\u2014a prior date to that of the  said judgment; aside from the fact that the credit held by the plaintiffs is not recorded in any instrument whatever of a public character. <\/p>\n<p>The  circumstance that the plaintiffs now hold a  final judgment for the collection of their credit out of the assets of Aldecoa &amp; Co., they having no duly executed mortgage or pledge on any determinate property of the debtor  firm, can not  give them a preferred right over The  Hongkong and Shanghai Bank which has in its possession the shares in question, and holds them as a pledge and enlargement of security  for  its  considerable  mortgage  credit  of  more preferred right than the said credit  of the plaintiffs who, as aforesaid, had a recognition of this fact inscribed in the contract drawn up in the instrument of June 13, 1907, in which they intervened as one of the three contracting parties thereof.<\/p>\n<p>In  order that the plaintiffs may allege  that they have been prejudiced by the contract contained in the instrument executed on August 30, 1907, it is indispensable for them to show that they had a preferred right especially to the said shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co. Ltd.,\" and which was trampled under foot and defrauded by the contract of August 80, wherein they had no interest and were not parties obligated principally or subsidiarily; but since this latter contract or agreement is much less advantageous to The Hongkong and Shanghai  Bank than the previous one of June 13, in which the plaintiffs intervened as one of the parties to the contract, conviction is acquired of the groundlessness and unreasonableness of the said plaintiffs' claim, precisely because they were unable to allege or to show that they had a better right than The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and that, by the execution of the contract of August 30 between Aldecoa &amp; Co. and the bank, they were prejudiced in their rights and interests.<\/p>\n<p>In order that once for all it may appear what is and in what consists the right  acquired by The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank to the said shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co. Ltd.,\"  it is necessary to consider that Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, would not  have succeeded in recovering these shares were it hot for the intervention of, and the P50,000 bond  given by, The Hongkong and Shanhai Banking Corporation, as related in full in the instrument of August 14, 1907, found on page 9 of  the bill of exceptions, from Which it appears that, through a compromise agreement made and entered into by and between  the defendant Alejandro S. Macleod, the holder  of the said shares, the party of the first part and the firm of Aldecoa &amp; Co. and The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, the parties of the second part, and for  the purpose of compliance therewith, the condition had to be fulfilled that was required by the defendant  Macleod,  to wit, that both Aldecoa  &amp;  Co.  and The  Hongkong  and Shanghai Bank  should desist from their claims and  the latter  should  effect a dissolution of. the injunction which prevented Macleod and his wife from disposing of certain promissory notes referred to in  the said compromise agreement.<\/p>\n<p>As may be seen by the terms of the latter, all the property surrendered by Alejandro S. Macleod and his wife, such as the shares in question, the pro indiviso parcel of real estate, the credits against the widow and children of the deceased Escano and the balance owing Macleod, was transferred to Aldecoa &amp; Co., without The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank having obtained either property or credits in compensation for the renunciation and surrender  that it had made, and only in the instrument of the same date, August 14, executed by  and between the liquidator  of Aldecoa &amp; Co. and  the agent  of the said banking corporation,  was  it covenanted that the stipulation of the  contract set forth in the instrument of June 13th should be carried out, to the effect that the said shares with their corresponding dividend should be delivered to the bank aforementioned,  without prejudice to the contract which the interested parties might subsequently make for the purpose of crediting their value in the balance, leaving the shares in question as an  additional security  for the debt of Aldecoa &amp; Co.  Such is the sole positive benefit obtained by The Hongkong and  Shanghai Bank in the said transaction  with  Alejandro  S. Macleod and his  wife, according to the instrument  of August  14,  1907, and  in exchange therefor it had to give a bond of 50,000 pesos to guarantee the liability of  Aldecoa  &amp; Co., in liquidation, before the courts.<\/p>\n<p>With regard to whether the  liquidator, William  Urquhart, had or did not have the power to execute the contract drawn up on August 30, 1907\u2014the plaintiffs deny that he had it  and founded their petition for nullity on the alleged absence of such power\u2014it is of the highest interest, for the elucidation of this  point,  first to proceed to examine the authority and power conferred upon the liquidator Urquhart by the  members of the firm of Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, as shown by the minutes of  the meeting held by them in this city on January 24, 1907, and which as Exhibit A, are of record on page 39 of the bill of exceptions.<\/p>\n<p>It appears in the said minutes that the liquidator Urquhart was authorized:  (<em>b<\/em>) To treat with The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in order that it might assist him in the liquidation by his obtaining the sum he might need for the payment of debts and the maintenance of the proceedings of liquidation, he being vested with the power to execute whatever public or private documents might be necessary or advantageous for the purpose of carrying out any agreement between Aldecoa &amp; Co. and the said bank; (<em>c<\/em>) to sue the debtors of the firm to enforce immediate payment; (<em>f<\/em>) to  compromise questions and  suits, whenever  thereby some advantage might accrue to the members and  their creditors; (<em>g<\/em>)  to  award, in payment of  debts, property, rights  and shares of the firm of Aldecoa &amp; Co.; (<em>h<\/em>) to sell real and chattel property belonging to the company, at the most suitable prices payable  in cash or on time and secured by mortgages or by pledges;  (<em>i<\/em>) to represent the liquidation before  the courts by exercising all the proper actions and by  performing and carrying out every  necessary act and proceeding until the  final determination of the litigation, it being understood that the authority and power conferred upon the said liquidator by resolution adopted by the members of the firm aforementioned, shall not be interpreted as limiting or restricting in any manner the  power vested in him by the Code of Commerce.<\/p>\n<p>The  liquidator, availing himself of the authority granted him in  clause (<em>b<\/em>) above cited, applied to The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank for a bond of fifty thousand pesos in order to recover from Alejandro S.  Macleod the shares in question, by virtue of the powers (<em>c<\/em>), (<em>d<\/em>)  and (<em>f<\/em>), aforementioned, find the bank,  upon giving  the  said  bond, required  as a condition, at first,  that set forth in the instrument of June 13,  and afterward, the less  onerous  one stipulated  in the instrument of August 30.  It is therefore neither reasonable nor just to assert that the said liquidator in his acts overstepped his power  and authority and  was wholly unauthorized to mortgage the shares concerned to the bank, because he  obliged  himself in  a  lesser manner  than  he was authorized by clause  (<em>g<\/em>),  above, mentioned, and it is indisputable that he who may sell is  authorized to give in pledge property of the firm for which he is the liquidator.<\/p>\n<p>Is it possible to believe,  in the natural course of things, that The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank would have been willing to an increase  of the debt of Aldecoa &amp; Co. or to have contracted in behalf of the latter, liabilities,  without the safeguard of  any  security whatever?   The plaintiffs know, of course, that it is not, as they were one of the three parties who executed the aforesaid instrument of June 13, 1907, in the second clause of which provision is made for the liability that might be incurred by the said banking corporation on account of the bond it had given.<\/p>\n<p>If the liquidator had not employed due diligence to recover the said shares, the same would  not  have entered into the assets of Aldecoa &amp; Co. and then, assuredly, he would have contracted liability through a failure to comply with his duty.  However, all the efforts exerted by the liquidator to recover those shares would  have been useless if The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank had not given the P50,000 bond.<\/p>\n<p>Just as  the judgment appealed from uselessly took up the nature and conditions of the contract ratified on June 13, 1907, between  the  plaintiffs Aldecoa &amp; Co. and  The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, for the simple  reason that said plaintiffs did not claim nullity thereof but of the contract of August  30 following, so this decision must not touch upon that contract of June 13; and if mention has necessarily been made thereof in the foregoing discussion it is due to the close relation that exists among the contracts  recorded in the instrument of June 13,  the  two of August 14, one of which latter  contains the  transaction whereby the shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co., Ltd.\" were recovered,  and  that of August 30, the only  one impugned by the plaintiffs.<\/p>\n<p>No just reason nor legal ground is offered whereby it may be affirmed that the contract duly executed on August 30, 1907, is, on account of its being a rectification of the prior ppe of June 13th of the same year, null and void in itself and of no legal value, since such rectification solely concerns the rights of The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and in no wise affects the obligation contracted by the plaintiffs in the before mentioned instrument of June 13.  On the contrary, the  renunciation made by the creditor  bank to collect, by the surrender of the said shares, a part of its credit, is favorable to Aldecoa &amp; Co., which  firm succeeded in reserving to itself the right to sell those shares and to apply their price, without dividends  and  profits, toward paying off  its mortgage debt to the  said  bank,  and this benefit stood  likewise  in  behalf  of the plaintiffs, as  the mortgage bondsmen of the said firm in securing the debt to the bank, and also as creditors of the former, for, had not the bank made the said renunciation contained in the instrument of August 30 and had it collected a part of its credit, keeping the shares that had been surrendered to it by the contract of June 13, there would have been no dividends nor profits from the shares in litigation, alloted to the amortization and reduction of the debt of which the plaintiffs are sureties, and no hope of selling such shares at a price perhaps in excess of their present value.<\/p>\n<p>Even on the hypothesis that the contract  of August 30, 1907, the only  one impugned by the plaintiff party, were held to be null and void, the other prior contract of June 13 of the same year would still subsist in full force  and effect and whereby Aldecoa &amp; Co. and the  plaintiffs covenanted and agreed that The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank should collect a part of its credit by applying to the amortization of the same the shares in question, an operation which the plaintiffs, who took part and  obligated themselves in the said contract, can not repudiate or deny; therefore, once it is proved  that the  liquidator, in executing the  contract of August 80, acted within and in accordance with the powers which were conferred upon him by the members of the firm       of Aldecoa &amp; Co., and it is not shown that the plaintiffs had a better right than the bank to the shares in litigation, or that they suffered detriment and damage as a result of the contract of August 30, it is not lawful nor can  it be countenanced that there be a successful issue to the plaintiffs' demand, to wit, that, after a declaration of nullity of the said contract of August 30, the shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co. Ltd.,\" be  sold by the sheriff and the proceeds of the sale applied to the payment of the sum which Aldecoa &amp; Co. owe the plaintiffs, because this, were it done, would be a complete violation of the  prior contract of June 13, which was not broken  by the bank, and of the renunciation made by the latter corporation to collect a part  of its credit out of the Value of the  said shares surrendered to it.   If any injury was occasioned, it would not be to the plaintiffs, but to the creditor bank itself.<\/p>\n<p>In the course of our reasoning in  previous paragraphs  of this decision,  we maintained that the contract of August 30 shows no defect  whatever of those which, according to the law, invalidate contracts executed pursuant to the requisites specified in article 1261 of the Civil Code, and that the plaintiffs had not the rights and the personality to  have enabled them to prosecute the action for the nullity of the said  contract of August 30. Let us see whether this contract  is susceptible of recission and whether it may  be  comprised within any of the cases specified in  the law, though it  does not appear that  an action for rescission was exercised in this suit.<\/p>\n<p>Article 1291 of the Civil  Code prescribes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The following may be rescinded:<\/p>\n<p>\"1. The contracts which  may be  executed  by  guardians without  the authorization of the  family council, provided the persons they represent have suffered lesion of more than one-fourth part of the value of the things which  may have been the value thereof.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. Those executed in representation of absentees, provided the latter have suffered the lesion referred to in the preceding number.<\/p>\n<p>\"3. Those executed in fraud of creditors, when the latter can not recover, in any other manner, what is due them.<\/p>\n<p>\"4. Contracts relating to things in litigation should they have been executed by the defendant without the knowledge and approval of the parties in litigation or of the competent judicial authority.<\/p>\n<p>\"5. Any other contracts specially determined by law.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>A mere perusal of the five paragraphs of the preinserted article shows that the contract of August 30, executed by and between Aldecoa &amp; Co. and The Hongkong and Sanghai Bank, is not comprised within any of the cases of rescission specified in the code, nor does it appear to be specially determined by law as susceptible of rescission, inasmuch as the bank's having been satisfied to hold and keep in  its possession the shares in question,  as a  pledge, instead of having applied them to the  payment of a part of its credit, as  it was allowed to do in the beginning, does not bring the case within the  scope of those enumerated in the said article 1291 and which require  rescission, and much less does  it establish that that contract  of August 30 was executed in fraud of the plaintiffs as creditors of Aldecoa &amp; Co. because it must be taken into account that their credit, prior to the judgment of September 30,  1908, whereby Aldecoa &amp; Co., in liquidation, were  sentenced to pay the same, was of  a common and simple character and was not recorded in any document of a public nature, while the credit of The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank against the aforesaid firm reaches an amount more than three times greater  than that of the plaintiffs' credit and is recorded in a public instrument of the date of February 23,  1906, long prior to the  said judgment of the Court of First Instance, and  is secured by mortgage upon several improved properties belonging to the plaintiffs and to their mother, Isabel Palet.<\/p>\n<p>With  respect to  the nature and effects of the judgment before mentioned of  September 30, 1908,  in behalf of  the       plaintiffs and against Aldecoa &amp; Co., we quote section 277 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The  rights of a party  can  not be prejudiced by the declaration, act or omission of another,  except by virtue of a particular relation between them, as hereinafter stated; therefore proceedings against one can not affect another.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It has not been shown that there exists any special relation such as constitutes the exception provided for in the above section, between the plaintiffs, Aldecoa &amp; Co. and The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, in respect to the debt of Aldecoa &amp; Co. to the plaintiffs; therefore,  whatever may be the nature and effects of the judgment obtained by the latter against the former, that judgment can not affect The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, nor produce, with respect thereto, the results derived from <em>res adjudicata<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>As to the lapse of the term fixed for the payment of the amount  referred to in  the mortgage instrument  of February 23, 1906, although it is indifferent whether  the said term has or has not expired and the credit were not demandable before the 24th of February, 1911, with respect to the contract of August 30, in view of the terms and conditions stipulated in this instrument, since it does not concern the surrender, as a payment, of the said shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co., Ltd.,\" but merely their delivery in pledge as an additional security for the said credit of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank; yet, withal, it is pertinent for the purposes of this decision to state that Aldecoa &amp;  Co., according to paragraph 7 of the said instrument of February 23, 1906, was obligated to amortize its debit  balance by the payment of a minimum sum of P50,000 per annum on or before December 31, 1906, until  its debt should be reduced on January 1, 1911, to P225,000, it being understood that the annuities for the amortization at the rate of P50,000 a year should begin to run from January 1, 1906, and  be paid successively until December 31,1910, in such manner that on January 1, 1911, the debt should  not exceed P225,000; the payments, therefore, as has been seen, were to be partial and were to fall due on successive dates, it having been stipulated , however, in clause 13, that in case of failure of payment the creditor bank should not demand the sale of the mortgaged properties until after the lapse of five years from the date of the contract.  So that the term for the gradual payment of the credit  of P475,000 is one of. successive installments and is distinct from the term fixed within which, for failure of payment, the sale of the mortgaged properties might be demanded; and, finally, upon the petition of the bank\u2014the only party interested, as  is logical, in having its interests safeguarded and secured\u2014and not at the request of the liquidator, the plaintiffs intervened in the contract drawn up in the instrument of June 13, 1907, for the reason set forth in clause 2 thereof, to wit,  that in case that the creditor bank  should incur liability  on account of the said P50,000 bond, the obligation assumed by Aldecoa &amp; Co. to indemnify it, should be  aggregated to the amount of the said credit  and its payment to the bank secured by the same mortgages stipulated in the instrument of February  23, 1906;  and as  the mortgage sureties  were, among others, the plaintiffs themselves, the representative of The Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank rightly required that the defendants should take part,  as they did, in the said instrument of June 13, whereby it was  stipulated that the latter's bond should likewise respond for the liability  which might be incurred by The Hongkong &amp; Shanghai  Bank on account of the bond given for  the recovery of the said  shares of \"The Pasay Estate Co., Ltd.\"<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, it is proper, in our opinion, to decide,  as we  hereby do, with a reversal of the judgment appealed  from of August 31, 1910,  that there  are  no grounds upon  which to hold that the contract contained in the instrument of August 30th is null and void, and the defendants, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation  and Aldecoa  &amp; Co., are absolved from the complaint, without special finding as to costs.  So ordered.<\/p>\n<em>Arellano, C.

But as the rights of the parties under Exhibit B have  never been determined, I think the  shares should remain in possession of the bank  until these rights are fixed.

The injury to the plaintiffs resulting from said contract must be shown before they can recover in this action.  This has not been shown.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> If Exhibit C is held void for any reason, then Exhibit B, the contract of June 13, 1907, in which the defendant bank agreed  to apply the  stock in question to the payment of the claim  which  it held against Aldecoa &amp; Co., remains in full  force and effect.   All  6i the plaintiffs save one signed this document.  Those who signed it are, of  course, bound by its terms, not having in any way impugned  its validity or binding force  in this action.  As to the other plaintiff, the contract is  equally binding.   Although said contract was made  by the liquidator of Aldecoa &amp; Co. for and on behalf of said company, no one has impugned  its validity or binding force  in this action, and it, therefore, stands as against the plaintiff Cecilia, although she  did not sign it.  This  contract  places the title to the stock in the defendant  bank, it being authorized, and it agreeing, to apply said stock, immediately on receiving it, in reduction of the debt of Aldecoa &amp; Co.  Until this contract is set aside, and no such remedy is asked for in this action, plaintiffs can not be heard to ask, as they do in their complaint, that the title to said  stock be turned  over to Aldecoa &amp; Co., then sold by the sheriff, and the proceeds  applied to the payment of <em>plaintiffs'  debt <\/em>against Aldecoa &amp; Co.; nor are they entitled to the redress granted by the judgment before us, and for the same reason.  This judgment is in violation of said agreement  of the 13th of June, 1907, which is indisputably of binding  force between  the  parties hereto so far as this action is concerned.   The bank has fulfilled the terms of that agreement  on its part, except the mere application  of the payment which it can be compelled to make if Exhibit C is void.   No  rescission of that  contract is  asked for in, this action  (Civil Code, articles 1290 to 1299), nor do the plaintiffs ask for  a declaration of  nullity (Id., articles 1300 to 1314).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>",

This land is divided by a \"pilapil\" into two lots, described in the petition as parcel A and parcel B, the first  containing 4,776.90 square meters, and the second 1,729.95 square meters.<\/p>\n<p>This application  was contested by Andres Aragon with respect to one-half of  parcel A, which he alleged belonged to him by inheritance from his deceased mother.  The opponent further alleged that parcel B belongs to the two sisters Isidra and Maxima Serrano.<\/p>\n<p>Judgment was rendered by the land court, the Honorable Pedro Concepci6n presiding, directing that parcel A be inscribed in the names  of Deogracias Serrano and  the opponent, Andres Aragon, and that  parcel B be inscribed in the names  of the  petitioner and  his sister, Isidra Serrano. From this judgment the petitioner appealed.<\/p>\n<p>It is admitted that  the two small parcels of land sought to be registered are properly described in the petition and that the same belonged to  Maximo Serrano and  Valentina Aragon, both now deceased.<\/p>\n<p>This case  presents two  issues: First,  is  the  opponent Andres Aragon a son of Maximo Serrano and Valentina Aragdn? and, second, did Isidra Serrano sell to the petitioner all of her right, title,  and interest in the land sought to be registered before the  institution of this suit?<\/p>\n<p>As to the  first issue, it is admitted by all concerned that Maximo Serrano and  his wife Valentina Arag6n have both been  dead for  more  than  ten  years; that  the baptismal certificate presented by the petitioner shows  that \"on December 1, I860, there was solemnly baptized and anointed with holy oil one Andres Aragon, a child two days old, of the  legitimate  marriage of Don Teodorico  (Aragon);and Dona Lucia Vasquez,\" and that the godfather of this infant was one Marcelino Aragon; that Andres Aragon never at any time lived with the said Maximo and Valentina,  and that he always signed his name \"Andres Aragon.\"  Furthermore, the opponent does not even claim that he at any time prior to the institution of this action in the court below (which was long after the death of Maximo Serrano and his wife Valentina and also of Teodorico Aragon and his wife Lucia Vasquez) asserted that he is  a brother of the  petitioner.<\/p>\n<p>What is the kind and character of evidence which, under these admitted facts, public policy and public necessity ought to require to establish the opponent's right to inherit a part of the estate left by the deceased Maximo Serrano  and Valentina Aragon?<\/p>\n<p>The opponent claims to be a natural child of Maximo Serrano and Valentina  Aragon, legitimatized by their  subsequent marriage.<\/p>\n<p>Only natural children can be legitimatized.  (Art.  119, Civil Code.)  The legitimation of natural children shall take place by the subsequent marriage of their parents, provided that the  parents in every case acknowledge such children either before or after the marriage.   (Arts.  120 and 121, <em>supra<\/em>.)<\/p>\n<p>The recognition or acts constituting recognition is or are and  has or have always been purely voluntary on the  part of the father, except, perhaps, in cases arising under the criminal law.  (5 Phil. Rep,, 1.) <sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> This is not true in regard to the mother.  Under the law in force prior to the Civil Code, proof of maternity was sufficient to impose upon the mother the duty of recognizing the children.  The same is true under the present law.   (5 Phil. Rep., 1.)  There is not now and never has been a single presumption in favor            of illegitimate children except that stated in article 130 of the Civil Code.  They must establish by competent proof every essential requisite required by law before they can be declared natural children and entitled to the.benefits as such. In  the case of the  father, there must be presented  an authentic document wherein the paternity of the illegitimate child is expressly  acknowledged; or it must be shown that such child or person has enjoyed the  uninterrupted status of a natural child.  The mere fact of birth gives no legal right to the child and imposes no legal duty upon the father. Again, the  mere fact that one is the father of a natural child does not impose upon him the obligation to recognize it as his natural child.   (5 Phil. Rep., 1.)<\/p>\n<p>While proof of maternity is sufficient to impose upon the mother,  as  we have said, the obligation to recognize the child, yet this is not of itself sufficient, either  under the Law of Toro or the Civil Code to give it the status  of a natural child.  In order to give the child such a status, it is necessary to show also that at the time of its conception (under the Law of Toro, conception or birth) its parents could have married  with or without dispensation.  (Art.119, <em>supra<\/em>; Law 11 of Toro; 8 Phil. Rep., 135.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>)<\/p>\n<p>The right to claim the acknowledgment of a natural child lasts, as a general rule,  only during the life of his presumed parents.   An action for such acknowledgment may, as an exception, be exercised against the heirs of the  presumed parents in two cases: the first in the event of the death of the latter during the minority of the child, and second upon the discovery of some instrument of the express acknowledgment of  the child, executed by the father or  mother,  the existence of which was unknown during the life of the latter. (13 Phil. Rep., 249.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[2]<\/sup>)<\/p>\n<p>Public policy, indeed public necessity, demands that before an illegitimate child be admitted into  a legitimate family, every requisite of the law be completely and  fully complied with.  No one should ever be permitted upon doubtful evidence to take from legitimate children the property which they  and their parents have, by industry,  fidelity,  and frugality, acquired.   To do  so would,  in  many instances where the legitimate children had \"labored unsparingly in order that they might have the comforts of life and the joys of home,\" be manifestly contrary to the very plainest principles of justice.   And again, if this can  ever be done upon oral testimony alone,  after the lips of the alleged father and mother have been closed by death, such testimony must be \"clear, strong, and convincing.\"<\/p>\n<p>These rules and principles of  law are indisputable and must serve as our guide in the consideration and determination of the question presented.  In the light of them, let us now turn to the evidence and ascertain  whether or not the opponent has shown  that he is a natural son of Maximo Serrano and Valentina Aragon, legitimatized by subsequent marriage.<\/p>\n<p>Andres Aragon, according to his baptismal certificate, was born on the 29th of November, 1860, and was, at the time he testified in the court tielow, fifty years of age.  For the purpose of showing that he is a natural child of Maximo Serrano and Valentina Aragon, legitimatized by  a subsequent marriage of the said Maximo and Valentina,  he presented several witnesses, the first being Isidra Serrstno, thirty years of age and a legitimate daughter of the said Maximo Serrano and Valentina Aragon.  This witness first stated that according to her understanding Andres is a natural son of her deceased parents, he having been born  before their marriage.  Later she stated  that she understood that Andres was a legitimate son of her said parents.   This witness further testified that the  only reason she had for stating that Andres is either a natural or legitimate  child of her parents is that her whole family addressed him as \"cuya.\" On cross-examination this witness admitted that the word \"cuya\" is used also in addressing a first cousin as well as the eldest brother.  On account of the age of this witness, of course she could not have had personal knowledge of the birth of Andres.  If the word \"cuya\" is  applied to first cousin the same as to eldest brother as was understood by this witness, then her testimony is of no value whatever as even tending to establish the contention of the opponent, especially when we take into consideration that Andres is, as a matter of  fact, the first cousin of  this witness and according to her own testimony never lived in the house with her parents. The testimony of this witness, if it could be considered of weight, is discredited by t)ie fact that she is now an enemy of her brother, the petitioner, and is opposed to the registration of these parcels of land on the ground that she claims that she has not sold all of her interest  to the petitioner.<\/p>\n<p>The next  witness presented by the opponent is Tomasa Aragon, 58 years of age, and a daughter of Teodorico Aragon and Lucia Vasquez.  This witness testified  that her father and mother had no child named Andres; that Andres, the opponent, was born in her  parent's  home; that she witnessed the birth of this child Andre's and that she was eleven years of age at  that time.  It will be noted that at the time this witness testified Andres was fifty  years of age.  This fact is not questioned.   Then this witness would have been only eight years old when Andres was  born.  This witness is interested in  this case to the extent that  she is trying to assist her brother Andres Aragon to obtain a part  of the property left by the deceased Maximo and Valentina. She admits that  Andres never lived  in the  house with Maximo and Valentina.   These admissions taken into consideration, together with the fact that this witness never at any time prior to the commencement  of this action asserted that Andres was  not her brother, and considering her age at the time Andres was born, leaves her testimony very doubtful indeed.<\/p>\n<p>The next  witness, Petrona Aragon, 59 years of age, testified that she knows that Andre's is the son of Maximo Serrano and Valentina Aragon because Andrei always called Maximo \"father\" and that she did not know  why Andres never lived with his parents.  This witness does not state that Maximo ever called Andres his son or acted in any manner which would tend to show that he, Maximo, recognized Andres as his natural son.<\/p>\n<p>Isidra Aragon stated that Andres is not her brother but her first cousin; that she knows this to  be a fact because Andres was born in her home and is the son of Valentina Aragon and Maximo Serrano,  and that at all the family gatherings  Andr6s was addressed by Deogracias and his brothers and sisters as \"cuya.\"  According to the admitted facts, this witness was only five years of age when Andres was, born.  She gives no other reason why Andres is not her brother, but she does state that Andres never lived  in the house with Maximo and Valentina.<\/p>\n<p>The next witness is Mariano Basa,  27  years of age, and husband of Isidra Serrano, who testified that his wife's family always addressed  Andres  as  \"brother.\"<\/p>\n<p>The last witness presented by the opponent was Isidoro Aragon, 39  years of age.  This witness testified that in the family reunions he observed that the children of Maximo Serrano and Valentina Aragon always addressed Andres  as brother, that  Andres never lived in  the house with this family, and that Andres always signed his name \"Andres Aragon.\"<\/p>\n<p>The testimony of these witnesses would be doubtful  if there were nothing else in the record.   They all admit that the opponent never lived in the house of Maximo Serrano and Valentina Aragon, and that the opponent always signed , his name  \"Andres  Aragon,\" and furthermore^ neither of these witnesses had ever at any time up to the commencement of this action claimed that Andres  is the  brother of the petitioner.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, we have the testimony of the petitioner and that of his sister Maxima Serrano, who testified to the effect that Andres  is not their brother, that  they never recognized him as such nor called him by that name.  The testimony  of  these two witnesses  is corroborated by the baptismal certificate of the opponent, which shows that he is not the son of Maximo  Serrano and Valentina Aragon and their testimony is further corroborated by the admitted facts that Andres never lived in the house with their parents, and that he  always  signed  his name \"Andre's Aragon.\"   The record of the  church from which the baptismal certificate was taken, has  stood uncontradicted for fifty years.   The opponent, by allowing this record to so stand and by always signing his name \"Andres Aragon\" not only led the people in that vicinity  to believe that he is the legitimate son of Teodorico Aragon and Lucia Vasquez, but also no doubt led the deceased  Maximo and Valentina to believe  the same thing.   He made no attempt to correct this alleged error until after the parties most interested had died.   He now seeks to besmirch the good names of Maximo and his wife Valentina at a time when they cannot  defend themselves, their names, and legitimate children.<\/p>\n<p>While it may be that this action can not be considered as an action on the part of Andres Aragon  to establish that he is a natural child legitimatized by subsequent marriage of Maximo Serrano and Valentina Aragon, a confirmation of the judgment appealed from would have practically the same effect as a judgment now declaring that he is in fact such a son. It was to stop such unreasonable claims that the legislature placed  upon the  statute books article 137 of the Civil Code.  This article expressly provides that actions for the claims of natural children  can be instituted only during the life of the presumed parents.  There are only two exceptions  to this rule, and it is not claimed that the opponent comes within either  of these exceptions.   In view of the express provisions of this article, we presume that no one would claim that the opponent  could successfully maintain an action against the heirs of the deceased Maximo Serrano and Valentina Aragon to compel them to acknowledge that he is the natural son legitimatized by subsequent marriage of their parents.  The provisions contained in this article are based upon the very soundest reasons and natural justice. Illegitimate children should not be admitted into the home of a legitimate family unless the proof is strong and convincing showing that every requirement of the law has been strictly complied with.  The writers of the code no doubt had in mind that there would arise instances where certain illegitimate children, on account of the strong temptation due to the large estates left by deceased persons, would.attempt to establish that they were natural children  of such persons in order to get part of the property; and furthermore, they considered that it is nothing but just and right tljat alleged parents should have a personal opportunity to be heard.  It was for these reasons and others equally as well founded that article 137 was enacted.<\/p>\n<p>In reference to the claim of Isidra Serrano that she did not sell to her brother all of her interest  in the two lots sought to be registered, it is sufficient in our opinion to say that the private document itself  which she  admits to have signed shows clearly that she did sell all of her interest in these two lots. Aside from this document, there is  the testimony of the petitioner and  his sister  Maxima to the effect that Isidra did in fact sell him all of her interest in these two parcels of land.<\/p>\n<p>We have often said  that we will be slow to reverse a judgment of the trial court when it must be reversed upon questions of fact.   In this case we think the trial court failed to give due weight and credit to the important admitted facts as above  stated.<\/p>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment appealed from is reversed and judgment  will be entered in favor of the petitioner directing the inscription of the land  as prayed for in  his petition, without costs.<\/p>\n<em>Arellano, C.

It is alleged in the complaint that said Tan Tungco was born in  Tangua, China, in  1853; that he married the plaintiff, Son Cui, in Tangua, China, about the year 1868; that .neither  party to  the marriage brought any property thereto; that there were born of said  marriage six  sons, named Tan Chui Too, Tan  Sipco  (Luico), Tan Coco, Tan Quico, Tan Muico, and Tan  Chujay; that Tan Tungco died in Amoy, China, on the 21st day of April, 1892, leaving a last will and testament purporting to have been executed in July, 1891; that after the death of Tan Tungco three of the sons above named, Tan Muico,  Tan Chujay, and Tan Quico, died intestate and that the four plaintiffs herein are their only heirs at law;  that under said  will Leon  Guepangco, Antonio Roxas, and the defendant Atanasia  Guepangco were  made alternative executors, and that upon the death of Tan Tungco they took possession of all of his property, both  real and personal,t together with all his papers, documents, and books of accounts, and administered said property until the 25th day of April, 1901, when it was distributed among the defendants, in whose possession it has since  remained; that with the income  from the property of Tan Tungco, the defendant Atanasia Guepangco acquired other properties of considerable value;  that she has never accounted  for the property taken over by her from the estate or acquired by her from the proceeds thereof during the administration,  but has,  on the contrary, concealed and hidden that property,  together with the rents  and profits therefrom, making it impossible  for the plaintiffs to ascertain its amount and value; that the value of the property belonging to  said estate, so  far as  plaintiffs  are  able to ascertain, is  about P700,000; that the  plaintiffs are the only legitimate surviving heirs of Tan Tungco and as such are the owners of all his estate.<\/p>\n<p>It is further  alleged in  the complaint that Tan  Tungco was a Chinese subject at the time of his  death and that his property ought, therefore, to be distributed according to the laws of China;  that under the laws of China the mistress and illegitimate  children  living outside the family take nothing, and  the daughters are  entitled to nothing but support until marriage, when they may claim the marriage dowry.   The plaintiffs pray for a discovery, an accounting; a receivership; the notation of a Us pendens in the registry of property with respect to all of the real estate belonging to the estate; that the plaintiffs be declared the only surviving heirs of Tan  Tungco, and as such the legal owners of the original estate of Fernando  Roxas Tan Tungco and the property into which it has been converted; that the defendants be declared to have held the original property,.and the property into which it has been converted, as well as the rents and profits  therefrom, in trust for the plaintiffs; that the will above referred to be set  aside as making an unlawful disposition of the estate in that it deprives the plaintiffs of the property to which they are entitled under the law and of which the deceased  could not legally deprive them.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants deny generally.  As a special defense they allege that Tan Tungco was born in China in 1842; that he came here when he was 11 years of age and lived here continuously, with the exception of short journeys made to China, until he was 43 years of age; that he established  his permanent  residence  and domicile in the Philippine Islands and  acquired  a large  property and  had extensive business interests which he maintained here until his death; that he was baptized  in  the Christian faith and afterwards, on or about the year  1871, being then single, he married the defendant Atanasia Guepangco y Lim; that they lived  together  as husband  and wife from that time forward until the death of said Tan Tungco; that the result of  that  union was  the four  defendants Luisa, Romana, Cecilia, and Maria;  that Tan Tungco, by the said will of the 15th of July, 1891, named these said children as his only legitimate children and as  his only legal heirs; that after the death of Tan Tungco an appraisal and inventory of his  estate was made and thereafter it was partitioned and divided in accordance  with the will, which partition was approved by the  Court of  First Instance of the city of  Manila.  Defendants further allege  that the  plaintiff Son Cui has no right,  interest, or participation whatever in the estate of Tan Tungco, and that the other plaintiffs, the illegitimate Chinese sons of Tan Tungco, have no other right, interest, or participation in the property of Tan Tungco than that  given them by the will above named.<\/p>\n<p>It is undisputed that Fernando Roxas Tan Tungco was born in the year 1842 in the town of Cuayan, China; that in the year 1853, when 11 years old, he came tp the Philippine Islands;  that he went into business as an industrial partner in a shop on Calle Rosario in the city  of Manila, and subsequently became  the owner of the business; that some time in the year 1866 he and the defendant Atanasia Guepangco,  although unmarried, began to live  together as man and  wife, and a child was born to  them on the 13th day of March, 1867, to whom the name Leandro was given; that in 1869 another child was born, and in 1871 after three children had been born to them,  one of whom died, the parents were  married; that a number  of children were born after the marriage; that those children born of that union whose names do not appear here as defendants are dead, their only heirs at law being the defendants in this action.<\/p>\n<p>It is also substantially undisputed that the plaintiffs in this action Tan Chui Too, Tan Coco, and Tan Sioco  (Luico) are the sons of Tan Tungco by the plaintiff Son Qui, substantially the only question being as to whether these children are legitimate or illegitimate.  It is admitted that if they are  illegitimate and  are  not recognized  as  natural children they  have no interest whatever in the estate  of their father under the laws of the  Philippine  Islands. Having been recognized, however, by Tan Tungco as natural children, it is admitted that as such they are entitled to the same rights in his property as he gave  them in his will. (Civil Code, art. 840.)  The main question to determine, therefore, is whether or not said  three  plaintiffs  are the legitimate children of Tan  Tungco; for if legitimate, their interests would be  greater than they otherwise would.<\/p>\n<p>Upon this question the evidence is hopelessly conflicting. The plaintiffs have presented as  witnesses persons who allege that they saw with their own eyes the marriage performed between Son Cui and Tan Tungco in Tangua, China, in the year 1868.  They have presented what is termed the marriage contract between the family of Tan Tungco and Son Cui,  bearing date June or July,  1868; they  have presented the plaintiff Son Cui, the alleged wife of Tan Tungco, who testifies to the marriage and to the fact that she lived with her  husband during the short periods that he visited China and  that she bore him six children as heretofore stated.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand,  the defendants introduced evidence tending to show that Tan Tungco came to the Philippine Islands when he was 11 years old, in other words, in 1853, and that he never left the Islands until the year 1872 at the earliest.  The evidence thus presented consists in the testimony of the Filipina wife Afanasia, the defendant, and of other persons who had knowledge of the fact.  It also con- sists of certain data, or the absence of certain data, in the public records of the Philippine Islands relative  to' Tan Tungco, which data should have been matter of public record if Tan Tungco had left the Philippine Islands for China in the year 1868 as alleged by the plaintiffs.   Defendants assert, in the first place, that from the year 1867 forward no Chinaman was allowed to leave  the Philippine Islands without first obtaining special permission  to do so and without procuring also a passport, which permission and the issuance of which  passport became necessarily public records. Defendants assert, in the second place, that, in the year 1867, Tan Tungco, as did every other Chinese  resident of the Philippine Islands, had  what was  known in the Spanish law as  a registered residence number; that that number remained the same so long as the holder thereof  remained continuously in the Philippine Islands.  If, however, he left the Philippine Islands and thereafter returned, on his return such number was changed and he thereafter was  known under a different registered number.<\/p>\n<p>Basing themselves upon these facts the defendants assert and prove by the public records themselves and by the testimony of the keeper of those records of that date, that Tan Tungco was not given permission or a passport to leave the Philippine Islands at any time during the years from 1867 to 1871, inclusive, and that the registered residence number of Tan Tungco was the same in 1871 that it was in 1867. These two facts, and the conclusions drawn from them, are presented by the defendants to substantiate and support the direct  testimony given by the witnesses who  declare that Tan Tungco was continuously in the Philippine Islands from 1863 to 1872,  and from such evidence they assert that he could not have married Son Cui in China in  1868  as the plaintiffs allege.<\/p>\n<p>In this connection it must be remembered that Tan Tungco was  one of the  prominent Chinamen  of the Philippine Islands, particularly of  Manila.  He was a large business man, was a Catholic,  had married a Filipina woman, and was one of the first Chinese citizens of Manila.  Only a few years after he married the defendant Atanasia Guepangco he held various concessions from the Philippine Government, among  them the opium concession for  Iloilo,  Cagayan, Negros, and Antique,  these  facts show that he was prominent and rapidly progressing even before the year 1868.   It is not  conceivable that a man of such prominence and so widely known would  surreptitiously leave the Philippine Islands for China (as he did as late as 1871, if the testimony of the plaintiffs be true) without obtaining the consent and the passport required by law, thus jeopardizing not only his personal position in the community but his property and business interests.  So that, it having been demonstrated that  no passport was  issued to Tan Tungco from 1867 to 1871, inclusive, and that during that time he received no permission whatever to leave  the Philippine Islands, and that his registered residence number was the same in 1871 that it was in 1867, there is presented for our consideration a fact of striking importance.<\/p>\n<p>In reply the plaintiffs maintain  that the testimony of Atanasia Guepangco herself is a substantial admission upon the part of the defendants that the marriage between Son Cui  and Tan Tungco actually occurred, the only difference between the claims of the plaintiffs and those of the defendants being as to  the year in which it occurred; the plain- tiffs claiming that it occurred in 1868 and the defendants admitting that it occurred  in  1883.  The oft-repeated assertion of the plaintiffs that defendants admit the marriage is not supported by the record.  We do not find any admission whatever of the sort, and we are led to the conclusion that such assertion was  based upon the  testimony of Atanasia herself in  her declaration as a witness in her  own behalf to which we have just referred. She stated in effect that her husband, upon her  urgent  request by telegram, returned to  the Philippine Islands about 1882 or 1883 after a few months' absence in China; that she had been left in charge  of the business by Tan Tungco during his absence; that while he was away  she heard that he had gone there to get married, and being considerably upset over such news she had at once telegraphed him to return to attend to his own business as she would have nothing further to do with it; that upon his return, in the perhaps stormy scene which immediately succeeded his arrival, he made some statements to her indicating, as she seems to say, that he had  recently been married in China, but that he had been forced into the marriage by his mother, against his will. Another witness for the defense  testified to something somewhat  similar. This is  the only part of the  record so far as we have been able to discover, which could in any way be tortured into an admission on the part of the defendants of  the marriage of Son Cui and Tan Tungco.<\/p>\n<p>We do not belittle the importance of this testimony.   Of its competency and relevancy we need not  speak.  Under all the circumstances we hesitate to give it that importance and weight which the plaintiffs claim for it.  We are of the opinion that too much significance could easily be attached to it by a misunderstanding of its proper setting in this case. It is admitted, as we have said,  and that fact the deceased never attempted to conceal, that he was maintaining a concubine in China and that he was raising children by her. It is undoubted that he was maintaining both her and the children and that he went to China every two or three years for short visits, and, doubtless, lived with that family while there.  Such continuous cohabitation and such relationship, resulting in the creation and rearing of a family and extending  through a considerable period of years, might very readily lead persons, including Atanasia herself, to speak of the relationship as a marriage and the persons resulting from those relations as his family.  It is well known  that such relationships, carried on for such a long period of time, and the  rearing and maintenance of  a family, lead people generally to  speak of the parties  to  that relationship as husband and wife, and the fruits.thereof as the legitimate offspring of the parents.   We do not believe, therefore,  that too much stress should be laid upon the fact that Atanasia spoke of Son Cui  as the wife of Tan  Tungco, or even the fact that Tan  Tungco himself  spoke of her as his wife should be given too much prominence under  all the facts and  circumstances in this case.  Atanasia,  it must be remembered, was testifying to  an  event which occurred twenty-eight years before, which  was made up  of facts and  circumstances which she might easily have forgotten and  which she might easily have misunderstood, particularly in view  of the fact that her husband had returned hurriedly at her impatient request and  that the relations between  the two were probably considerably strained at the moment.  The  words which passed between them at that time were doubtless somewhat thoughtless,  may not have been well chosen, were spoken by a Chinaman to  a Filipina, and may not have been measured with that care and solemnity  which  characterizes  words used after  deliberation. These words must be taken in connection with the fact that Tan  Tungco, under  far  different circumstances and surrounded  by far different  conditions, made statements en- tirely at variance with that upon which the plaintiffs lay so much stress,   (a) At the time of his marriage to Atanasia in 1872 he solemnly deposed under oath that he was single and had never  been married previously, nor had he ever been engaged to be married theretofore.  (6) The will of June 15,1891, duly executed by Fernando Roxas Tan Tungco and duly attested and probated, contains the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Fourth. I give  and bequeath to my natural  children which  I have in China, namely, Tan Luico, Tan Coco, Tan Quico,  Tan Muico, and Tan Chujay, and Tan  Chui Too the one-third part of my property, for the reason  that I hereby recognize said children as my natural children in  the manner required by law, and for that reason the legacy which I bequeath to them is all the property which I am able to give them under the law, namely, a one-third part.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The  fifth clause of the will reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Fifth.' I declare, as I have already said, that I am married to Dona Atanasia Quepangco [of Binondo],  of which marriage there have been born various children, those now living  being Romana, Cecilia, Luisa, and Maria, all of the surname Roxas Tan Tungco y Quepangco.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In this instrument, as is seen,  the deceased Tan Tungco states what he evidently believed to be his true relationship with all of the  parties to this action.  It was a deliberate statement; it was made after due consideration of all the facts in the case and after due deliberation as to the effect which  such statements would have upon the  rights of the parties in  reference to whom  it  was made,  and  with the view that it would probably be the last word of his life upon that subject.  He knew that if that document contained a lie he would go to his grave with his last act a  falsehood and its fruit injustice.  Moreover,  the admission, so called, of the marriage, as made by Atanasia in her testimony is not corroborative of or corroborated by the testimony of the plaintiffs' witnesses as to the marriage as it is admitted that the two sets of witnesses were speaking of events happening fourteen years  apart.  As  between the two statements we are inclined to say  that that made in the will is entitled to the greatest consideration, and believe that to it should be given the greatest weight.  To say the least, we are satisfied upon the  whole case that the proofs are such that we can not justly say that the decision of the trial court in that respect is against their fair preponderance.<\/p>\n<p>We are constrained to believe that the judgment of the court  below upon the question  of the marriage in China is sustained by the evidence.  In support of this conclusion we desire to call particular attention to the case of Sy Joe Lieng <em> vs.<\/em> Sy Quia  (16 Phil. Rep., 137).  Substantially every word of the opinion in that case is applicable to the case at bar. The importance  of the question at issue; the kind of proof required  to  establish  the alleged  prior marriage when the later marriage is admitted by all; the difficulty on the part of the defendants of rebutting the testimony relating to the marriage presented by the  plaintiffs; th,e relationship of the witnesses testifying as to the marriage with the plaintiffs;  the  impossibility  of effective cross-examination of witnesses; the difference in nationality; the fact that the alleged Chinese wife and her children lived, as they allege, from1' 1868 to 1908 without having ever presented any claim against Tan Tungco;  that it was sixteen  years  after his death,  and after all his property had been divided in accordance with his will  before the plaintiffs began this action or made any claim whatever; that the proof of marriage by plaintiffs' witnesses is entirely  offset by the proofs of the defendants that there  could have been  no marriage at the time assigned; and many other facts and circumstances pertinent to this  case are there discussed in full with ample citations of  authorities.<\/p>\n<p>Upon all the evidence in this case and upon the authority of Sy Joe Lieng  vs, Sy  Quia, <em>supra,<\/em> the judgment in this case is affirmed, without special finding as to costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

A. Keller &amp; Co. Ltd. of the city of Manila, in bottles in which said sherry wine\u00a0 was contained and\u00a0 the devices and\u00a0 words thereon, and in other features of their appearance, which would be likely to influence purchasers to believe that the said sherry wine so offered for sale and so sold by said defendant was that manufactured\u00a0 by said\u00a0 Diez Hermanos\u00a0 and dealt\u00a0 in by said Ed.\u00a0 A.\u00a0 Keller\u00a0 &amp; Co. Ltd.,\u00a0 and clothed\u00a0 the said sherry wine so sold by said defendant with such appearance for the purpose of deceiving the public and of\u00a0 defrauding the said Ed. A,\u00a0 Keller &amp;\u00a0 Co. Ltd. of its legitimate trade. All contrary to the statutes in such cases\u00a0 made\u00a0 and provided.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Upon this complaint the defendant\u00a0 was arrested and duly arraigned, and pleaded \"not guilty.\"<\/p><p>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the Honorable A. S.\u00a0 Crossfield, judge, made the following findings of fact from such evidence:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"That the defendant purchased a distillery\u00a0 the first of the year 1910, but discontinued the distillery, and purchased wine and bottles sold upon the\u00a0 market; that the sherry obtained by him was bottled in the ordinary bottle known as a quart bottle, and the label placed upon the bottles in the early time of his bottling the sherry was very similar to the labels used and designated in the trade-mark of Ed. A. Keller &amp; Co.; that the defendant was called by the prosecuting attorney, and answering the call came to the office of the prosecuting attorney,\u00a0 and was there advised that his putting up\u00a0 sherry in the shape\u00a0 he did was\u00a0 unfair competition with the trade-mark of Ed. A. Keller &amp; Co.; that he was warned by the\u00a0 prosecuting attorney to desist, but that immediately afterwards he\u00a0 commenced\u00a0 putting up some sherry\u00a0 and\u00a0 using bottles with\u00a0 labels\u00a0 upon them much more closely resembling the trade-mark of Ed.\u00a0 A. Keller &amp; Co. than before, particularly in the kind of\u00a0 silk tassel upon the neck of the bottle; that while this silk tassel was not\u00a0 a part of the trade-mark of Ed. A. Keller &amp; Co., it had been used by them for a great\u00a0 many years in connection with\u00a0 the trade-mark, and anyone, without\u00a0 very close examination, would have been deceived by the similarity in appearance of the bottles\u00a0 of sherry put up by the defendant and sold by Ed. A. Keller &amp; Co. with\u00a0 trade-mark label upon\u00a0 it.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Upon\u00a0 the foregoing\u00a0 findings\u00a0 of fact Judge Crossfield found the defendant\u00a0 guilty\u00a0 of the crime charged in said complaint and sentenced him to pay a fine of one thousand pesos, and in\u00a0 case\u00a0 of insolvency to\u00a0 suffer subsidiary\u00a0 imprisonment until said fine was paid, and to pay the costs.<\/p><p>From\u00a0 that sentence the defendant appealed, and\u00a0 made the following\u00a0 assignments of\u00a0 error:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"I.\u00a0 The trial court erred in failing to dismiss the complaint for duplicity.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"II. The trial court erred in convicting the\u00a0 accused of the charges of the complaint,\u00a0 based upon section 7 of Act No. 666t without specifically\u00a0 finding\u00a0 (1) that\u00a0 it appeared from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an\u00a0 'actual\u00a0 intent'\u00a0 on the part of the accused 'to\u00a0 deceive the public, and to defraud' Ed.

A. Keller &amp; Co. of their legitimate trade,\" it may\u00a0 be said that the lower court found the defendant guilty of the crime charged in the complaint, and that the complaint charges that the defendant did willfully,\u00a0 unlawfully,\u00a0 and\u00a0 deceitfully, in the sale\u00a0 of sherry wine\u00a0 give to the same the general appearance\u00a0 of sherry wine manufactured by Diez Hermanos and sold by Ed. A. Keller &amp; Co., for the purpose of deceiving the public and of defrauding\u00a0 the said Ed. A. Keller &amp; Co.\u00a0 of\u00a0 its legitimate trade.\u00a0 Reading the positive part of the decision of the lower court\u00a0 together with\u00a0 the facts alleged in the complaint,\u00a0 it clearly appears that the\u00a0 lower court\u00a0 found that the defendant did with actual\u00a0 intent attempt to\u00a0 deceive\u00a0 the public and to defraud\u00a0 Ed. A. Keller &amp; Co. of their legitimate trade.\u00a0 This actual\u00a0 intent to\u00a0 defraud further appears from the fact that the attention\u00a0 of the defendant was called to the fact that he was\u00a0 unlawfully infringing upon\u00a0 the rights of\u00a0 the trade-mark of Diez Hermanos, by the prosecuting attorney\u00a0 of the city of Manila, and that he thereafter immediately made some alteration in the labels theretofore used\u00a0 by him, and\u00a0 used\u00a0 another\u00a0 more similar to that used by Diez Hermanos\u00a0 than\u00a0 the first one.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that\u00a0 from a careful reading of the record it will clearly appear that the defendant did, with actual intent, try to deceive the public and to defraud\u00a0 Ed.\u00a0 A.\u00a0 Keller &amp; Co. of their legitimate trade.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 believed that the various exhibits\u00a0 (A,\u00a0 B, C,\u00a0 D, E, and\u00a0 F)\u00a0 presented by the prosecuting attorney, cannot be examined\u00a0 without producing the conviction\u00a0 that the defendant\u00a0 did actually attempt to defraud Ed. A.\u00a0 Keller &amp; Co. of their\u00a0 legitimate trade in the sale of sherry wine for which they held a\u00a0 trademark.\u00a0 From an examination of the reasons given by the attorney for the appellant in support of\u00a0 the second assignment of error, and the argument of\u00a0 the Attorney-General in answer thereto, and in view of what this court has said in the cases of Jonas Brook Brothers<em> vs<\/em>. Froelich &amp; Kuttner\u00a0 (8 Phil. Rep., 580); U. S. vs. Manuel (7 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 221); Nelle\u00a0 <em>vs<\/em>. Baer, Senior &amp;\u00a0 Co.\u00a0 (5\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 608), we are of the opinion\u00a0 that the error complained of does not exist.\u00a0 In the case of Jonas Brook Brothers <em>vs<\/em>. Froelich &amp; Kuttner, <em>supra,<\/em> it was held that:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Any one who sells goods packed or labeled or otherwise prepared in\u00a0 such a manner as to induce intending purchasers to believe that the goods are of a make\u00a0 or origin other than\u00a0 the true\u00a0 one, or who clothes\u00a0 the goods with a certain appearance for the purpose of deceiving the public, is deemed guilty of unfair competition as defined by section 7 of Act No. 666.\u00a0\u00a0 The intention to deceive may be inferred from the similarity of the goods as packed and\u00a0 offered for sale,\u00a0 and an\u00a0 action will lie to\u00a0 restrain\u00a0 such unfair competition,\u00a0 and\u00a0 for damages.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In the present\u00a0 case it not only appears that the bottles used by\u00a0 the defendant for containing his wine were very similar in shape to the bottles used by Diez Hermanos, but the labels and everything\u00a0 attached to the outside of the bottle as appears from the exhibits presented shows clearly that the defendant intended to give the public to understand that the sherry wine which he was selling was that of Diez Hermanos.\u00a0 Not only did the bottles and\u00a0 the labels used by the defendant appear to be of the same sherry wine as that sold by Ed. A. Keller &amp; Co. Ltd., but the boxes in which the bottles were packed, as appears from the evidence, were also similar to the boxes used by Ed. A. Keller &amp; Co. in importing the sherry wine which they sold.\u00a0 Upon the whole record we find no reason\u00a0 for modifying the sentence of the lower court based upon this second assignment of error.<\/p><p>With reference to the third assignment of error, we are of opinion that what was said in relation to the deceit under the second assignment of error, sufficiently answers this third assignment of error also.<\/p><p>With reference to the fourth assignment of error, we think that what was said in answer to the second assignment of error answers this one also.<\/p><p>In the fifth assignment of error\u00a0 the appellant claims or contends that the lower court committed an error in imposing upon the defendant subsidiary imprisonment.\u00a0 From a reading of the sentence of the lower court it\u00a0 will appear that the lower court imposed upon the defendant subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of two and one half pesos per day until the fine of one thousand pesos should be. fully paid. The law does not permit subsidiary imprisonment to the extent imposed by the lower court.\u00a0 Act No. 1732\u00a0 of the Philippine\u00a0 Commission\u00a0 provides\u00a0 for subsidiary imprisonment for criminal offenses made punishable by any Act or Acts of the Philippine Commission.<\/p><p>Paragraph (b) of section 1 of said Act No. 1732 provides:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"In case the sentence of the court imposes both fine and imprisonment,\u00a0 the\u00a0 subsidiary imprisonment shall not exceed\u00a0 one-third\u00a0 of\u00a0 the term of\u00a0 imprisonment imposed by such\u00a0 sentence,\u00a0 and\u00a0 in no case\u00a0 shall such subsidiary imprisonment\u00a0 exceed one year.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>It will be noted that thiswparagraph does not apply to the present case, for the reason that in the present\u00a0 case a fine only was imposed.<\/p><p>Paragraph (c) of section 1 of said Act provides that:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"In case the sentence of the court merely imposes a fine, the subsidiary imprisonment shall not exceed six months.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In the present case a fine only was imposed.\u00a0 Therefore the subsidiary imprisonment shall not\u00a0 exceed six months. According to the decision\u00a0 of the lower court, to wit, that the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 should\u00a0 suffer\u00a0 subsidiary\u00a0 imprisonment until the full amount of the fine was paid, it will be noted that in order to pay the sum of one thousand pesos at P2.50 per day,\u00a0 it would require four hundred\u00a0 days, or a period of more\u00a0 than one\u00a0 year, whereas the law in cases like the present\u00a0 only permits subsidiary\u00a0 imprisonment to the extent of six months. Therefore that part of the sentence of the lower.court imposing subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of P2.50 per day until the fine is paid, is hereby reversed.<\/p><p>Upon a full consideration of all of the facts adduced during the trial of the cause, and the law applicable thereto, we are of the opinion that the sentence of the lower court should be modified, and\u00a0 it is hereby ordered that the defendant and appellant be sentenced to pay a fine of one thousand\u00a0 pesos,\u00a0 and in\u00a0 case of insolvency to\u00a0 suffer subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of P2.50 per day,\u00a0 which subsidiary imprisonment shall in no case exceed a period of six months, and\u00a0 to pay the costs.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J., Mapa, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

The trial court found, and the record clearly discloses:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That on May  11, 1900, one Elias Oro, president of the municipality  of Sapian,  Province of Capiz,  Philippine Islands, was engaged with a large number of other citizens of said  town  in  the  celebration of a  religious festival at a place in said town known as Matavia and situated on the seashore; that some time  during the forenoon of said day one Leocadio Pajarillo, accompanied by the accused and a number of other  persons,  appeared upon the scene, many of them armed with guns,  revolvers, bolos, and other arms; that said Leocadio Pajarillo was chief of the band,  the members of which acted under his orders in the commission of the depredations hereinafter mentioned; that Elias Oro attempted  to escape, but was captured and brought back to the beach, where he was severely beaten by Pajanuo for the purpose of making him  reveal his personal property; that  because of said beating Elias Oro caused to be brought  to the  beach at Matavia  a  trunk containing the sum of $700 Mexican currency, and certain jewelry of the value of  $150 Mexican currency, the property of Elias Oro, which property was, by  intimidation and violence, taken from said  Elias Oro by said Pajarillo  and  the accused; that said Pajarillo and the accused also, by force and intimidation,  took from  the  store-house of said  Elias  Oro in Matavia 800 <em>cavanes<\/em> of rice, the property  of said Elias Oro and of  the value  of $2,500  Mexican currency; that said Pajarillo and the  accused caused the said Elias Oro to be bound and detained on the beach at Matavia from shortly before  noon on the  morning  of the  11th  day of May, 1900, to about dawn of the following day, when  he made his escape; that on the same occasion  and at the same place said Pajarillo and the accused, by force  and violence, took from  the wife  of Elias Oro the sum of $300 Mexican currency, the property  of Elias  Oro; that after securing the above-described  property, some of the  accused, at the command of Leocadio Pajarillo, by force and violence, appropriated and took away  from the agents of said EHas Oro, 36  carabaos, the property of Elias Oro, of the value  of $1,920 Mexican  currency; also 2 carabaos  valued  at $120 Mexican  currency,  clothing of the value of $80 Mexican currency, and $20 Mexican currency, in money, the prop erty of Gregorio Nunez.   The court finds that the value of the property of Elias Oro, taken as  above mentioned, is P7,414.27 Philippine currency, and that the value of that taken from Gregorio Nunez is P235.95 Philippine currency; that the taking of all of the property heretofore mentioned was  a part of the same raid  or expedition  of Leocadio Pajarillo, the accused, and other  persons to the court unknown.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Appellants contend that they are entitled to the benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation of July 4, 1902, and we think that this claim must be sustained. <\/p>\n<p>In our decision in the case of U.

In the court below the protection afforded by the plea of amnesty was claimed on behalf of Leocadio  Pajarillo; and in this court,  counsel urges on behalf of all  the appellants that even if the court be of  opinion that the evidence sustains the  contention of the prosecution  that these defendants and appellants are the four individuals who fired upon and killed Giriaco Occefio, deceased, as charged in the information, nevertheless, upon  the facts  developed by the whole record,  they are entitled  to the benefits of  the Amnesty Proclamation.<\/p>\n<p>\"The declarative portion of  the  Amnesty  Proclamation is as follows: <\/p>\n<p>\" 'Now, therefore, be it known that I, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States of  America, by virtue  of the power and authority vested in me by the Constitution, do hereby proclaim and declare, without reservation or condition, except  as  hereinafter provided, a full and complete pardon and amnesty to all  persons in the Philippine Archipelago who have participated in the  insurrections aforesaid or who have given aid and  comfort to persons participating in said insurrections, for the offenses of treason or sedition and for all offenses political in their character committed in the course of such insurrections pursuant to orders issued by the civil or military insurrectionary authorities or which grew out of internal political feuds or dissensions between Filipinos and Spaniards or the Spanish authorities or which resulted from internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos themselves during either of said insurrections. <\/p>\n<p>\" '<em>Provided, however<\/em>, That the pardon and amnesty hereby granted shall not include such persons committing crimes since May first, nineteen hundred and two, in any province of the Archipelago in which at the time  civil  government was established, nor shall it include  such persons as have been heretofore finally convicted of the crimes of murder, rape,  arson,  or robbery by any military  or civil tribunal organized under the authority of Spain or of the United States of America, but special application may  be  made to the proper authority for pardon by any person belonging to the exempted classes, and such clemency as is  consistent with humanity and justice will be liberally extended.'\" <\/p>\n<p>\"In the  case of the  United  States vs.  Luzon (2 Phil. Rep.,  380), this court laid down the following proposition (p. 381) : <\/p>\n<p>\" 'To entitle a person to the benefits of this proclamation two things, at least, must concur: (1) He must have participated in  the insurrections  against  Spain  or the United States.   (2)  The crime wifh which he is  charged must be political in its nature.  Common  crimes, such as murder and robbery, are not included within the amnesty  unless they were committed under circumstances which  clothe them with a political character.   This court has constantly adhered to this doctrine.' \"<\/p>\n<p>\"While we  are of opinion  that the crime of murder committed by these appellants is not one of those included in the Amnesty Proclamation, we are not entirely agreed with the judge  of the trial court  as to the precise grounds upon which the claims of its benefits should be  denied.<\/p>\n<p>\"We base our denial of the benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation  strictly  upon  the  proposition that not  only is there nothing in the record which would sustain a finding that the crime  of murder of  which these appellants  are convicted was political in character, but that on the contrary the evidence strongly tends to disclose a  motive for the slaying of the deceased wholly  inconsistent with such a characterization of the offense. <\/p>\n<p>\"The trial judge seems to have laid considerable stress on his finding of a failure of proof  that at the  time when the crime was  committed these appellants were  participating in an insurrection or in a seditious uprising against Spain or the United  States.  He was of opinion that the movement headed  by  Leocadio  Pajarillo, which  resulted in the overthrow of the  local municipal officers on  the day of the murder  was directed rather against  the government set up by the leaders of the insurrection than against the sovereignty of the United  States, and that it had for its object merely his  own material  profit, selfish aggrandizement, and political advancement  in the municipality where he resided.   From these premises the trial judge concluded that whatever political character the offenses committed on that occasion may have  had, it did  not bring them within the terms of the Amnesty Proclamation.<\/p>\n<p>\"We think, however, that  under the liberal construction which should be given that  instrument, the offenses committed by Leocadio Pajarillo  and his partisans, which were incident  to their attempt to seize control of the municipal insurrectionary  government, must fairly be held to have 'resulted from internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos themselves' during the insurrection  then pending, and that the participants in the overthrow of the local municipal insurrectionary governments  were at the same time participants in one of the insurrectionary movements against the United States contemplated in the proclamation. In applying  the provisions  of  the Amnesty Proclamation we have  never stopped to inquire to what degree particular leaders of the various insurrectionary movements may have been impelled by the lust of personal aggrandizement and political advancement, nor have we sought to discover the reasons for the 'internal political feuds or dissensions among the Filipinos themselves to which reference is made in the proclamation, provided it  affirmatively appears that such feuds or dissensions could fairly be characterized  as political.  We are of opinion,  therefore, that all that was done by Leocadio  Pajarillo and his partisans  on the day of the murder, which under the most  liberal construction of the evidence of record can be said to have been an incident to the movement to seize the local municipal officials and set up a new municipal government must fairly be held to be included within the provisions of the Amnesty Proclamation.<\/p>\n<p>\"The question then presents itself, whether the  shooting of Occeno was or was not an incident of the political movement participated in by Leocadio Pajarillo and his partisans on the day the shooting took place.  This question, we think, must be  answered in the negative, and  in this conclusion we are agreed with the trial judge who rested his denial of the plea of amnesty not only on the ground that the political movement led by Leocadio Pajarillo was not such  a movement as  was contemplated in the Amnesty Proclamation, but that the shooting of Occeno had no political significance whatever, and was merely the outcome of a personal  difference with  the deceased.<\/p>\n<p>\"Accepting as true all the evidence of  record, including the testimony of the witnesses for the defense, which tends to disclose that, on the day of the murder,  Leocadio Pajarillo was at the head of a movement looking  to the capture of the local municipal officers and the seizure of control of the local municipal government, and  accepting as true his claim that at that  time he was a member of the  branch of the insurrectionary forces known  as macketeros, and  that he joined  in the movement against the  local officials  because he had heard that  the acting president  of  the town was contemplating a surrender to the American forces,  we still do not think the evidence is sufficient to maintain a finding that the cold-blooded murder of Occeno was committed in furtherance of that movement.   None of the other officials were killed and it does not  appear that any attempt  was made to kill them.  Even the president, against whom it is alleged the suspicion  of disloyalty was especially directed, was merely captured, apparenlty for the purpose of bringing him before higher  authority for discipline, or at least to hold him in detention until his captors had secured control of the town.  Aside from the personal motive attributed to Leocadio Pajarillo by the  witnesses for the prosecution, no  reason  suggests itself or has  been  suggested for the adoption of extreme measures in the case of Occeno.   Navarra, whose soldiers  were placed at  the  disposition of Pajarillo on that occasion, testified that Pajarillo reported to him that Occeno had  been  shot while  attempting to escape, thus indicating that no excuse could' be found at that time for the deliberate shooting of the deceasad.  The shooting did not take place under the strain of excitement incident to the movement, or in the heat of an altercation arising out of the  unusual incidents  of  the day.  Occeno was shot unarmed at the cold, gray dawn of the day, in his own house, through his partially opened door, without being given an opportunity to recognize his assailants, much less to enter into a discussion with them,  or  to laarn their object in attacking him.  The attacking party did not contain any of the revolutionary  soldiers who  were operating  under the orders of Leocadio Pajarillo, but consisted only of Pajarillo himself, his two brothers and his brother-in-law, and it is manifest that they had agreed upon his death before they sought him out at his home.  The evidence  strongly tends to disclose, if  it does not conclusively establish, the fact that the leader of that party was the paramour of the wife of the victim of the tragedy.   It is fair to assume that he had reason to fear the enmity  of the man he had wronged on the discovery of his  illicit relations with his wife.  In any  event  the  personal motive for the commission of the crime stands out strongly from the pages of the record, and nothing that  is contained therein justifies the conclusion that it was induced by any demand of political necessity or expediency.<\/p>\n<p>\"We  are of opinion,  therefore, that the defendants  and appellants have  not shown that the crime which they committed was political in character; that, while it is true that it was committed on the occasion of an  internal dissension among Filipinos during the course of an  insurrection, it did not result from  such dissension,  and that these defendants and appellants are not, therefore, entitled to the benefits of the President's Proclamation of Amnesty.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The facts  proven  in the present case are  very similar to those proven in the Pajarillo case;  in this case, however,  there is a total lack of evidence of \"the  personal motive for the commission of the crime\" which was developed in the record  in the former case. Upon the evidence submitted in this case, and giving the defendants the benefit of any doubt which may arise  as to the political character of the raid described in the opinion  of the court below, we are of opinion that they must be held to  be entitled to  the benefit of the Amnesty Proclamation.   There is evidence in the record which at least tends to prove that some if not all of the property seized during the raid  was  ostensibly intended for the use and support  of the  soldiers and other adherents of  the revolutionary movement.<\/p>\n<p>The sentence  imposed by the trial court should therefore  be and is hereby reversed,  and  the information  filed in this  case  should be  and is  hereby dismissed with  the costs  of this instance  <em>de  oficio<\/em>.  The defendants  and  appellants will be set at liberty forthwith.<\/p>\n<em>Mapa, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<div align=\"center\"><br\/>\n<em>DISSENTING<\/em><\/div>\n<p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The undersigned is of the  opinion that  the accused should be convicted, and that the penalty indicated by the Attorney-General should be imposed.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

LTD., DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.\n  <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"><p>This action was brought on April  12,  1911,  by  Rafael, Antonio,  Trinidad,  Cayetano, Rosario,  Gertrudis, and Carmen  Enriquez, and Antonio Gascon   (the latter being a minor, was represented by his guardian ad litem), as owners and lessors of the property  Nos. 72, 74, and 76 Escolta,  city of Manila,  against A.  S.  Watson  &amp;  Company, Ltd., as lessee of said property.  The plaintiffs allege that on June 22, 1906,  Rafael, Carmen, Antonio, and Trinidad Enriquez and Antonio Gascon executed to the defendant a contract of mortgage and lease upon their participation  in  that property; that on January 19, 1907, the other plaintiffs executed    the  same mortgage and  lease in favor of the  defendant upon their interest in the same property;  that the said contract of lease has been terminated by  the  payment by the plaintiffs to the defendant of the principal  and interest of the mortgage; that the said contract of  lease is null and of no effect by reason of the  minority  of the plaintiff Antonio Gascon, who is still a minor; that the defendant, after June 22, 1906, made all the repairs  necessary  to its business with the approval of the plaintiffs.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiffs further  allege that there exists  in that building a principal wall about one meter  in thickness and five  meters in height, which extends from  the  front of the building on the  Escolta to the rear of the  same; that upon this  wall rests the  second floor of the building and that it is necessary to safely maintain the building against earthquakes and typhoons; that on the 11th of  April, 1911, the defendant commenced to destroy and remove the said wall and  was on the  date of the filing of this complaint actually engaged in the destruction and  removal of the same; and unless restrained,  would continue  such   destruction and removal, to the irreparable injury  of the plaintiffs; and that the defendant has varied the form and substance of the leased premises.  The plaintiffs  therefore prayed that the defendant be prohibited from destroying and removing said  wall; that it be ordered to rebuild or replace that part which it had removed or  destroyed; and that the contract of lease be declared terminated and rescinded.<\/p>\n<p>On the 12th day of April, 1911, a preliminary injunction was issued by the Court of First Instance,  prohibiting and restraining the defendant  from continuing  the removal and destruction of the  wall in  question, and  requiring  it to appear in court  on the  17th of that month,to  show cause why  such preliminary  injunction should not be continued in force during the pendency of this action.<\/p>\n<p>On the 21st  of  that month,  the defendant company answered, admitting the allegations as to the ownership, mortgage, and lease, contained in paragraphs  1, 2, and 3 of the  complaint,  and denying  all the  other  allegations therein.  The defendant set  up by way of special defense that the wall in question was not a principal wall and did not extend the entire length of the building; that  said wall consisted of two shells filled with mortar;  that it  was very old, deteriorated, and weak; that it was necessary, in order to conserve the  property, to  remove said wall and to substitute it with other material; that the wall in question is so located that it and its subtenant are deprived of the use of a large part of the ground floor fronting on the Escolta; that under Clause M of the contract of lease, the defendant has  the right  to  remove  this wall,  substituting in lieu thereof other material, this being required by the business established in said  building.<\/p>\n<p>As a second special defense, the defendant admits the payment of the mortgage by  the plaintiffs, but alleges that the contract of lease is independent of the mortgage contract, and that in satisfying the mortgage of the defendant, the leasehold  was  specifically continued  in  force  by all parties.<\/p>\n<p>As a  third special  defense, the defendant alleges that under  the  provisions of Paragraph M of the contract of lease, it has expended the sum of over sixty thousand pesos in improving the leased premises, and that on making such expenditure it believed that  it would be  reimbursed by enjoying the occupancy and subrenting of the premises.<\/p>\n<p>On the 24th day of May, 1911, the Philippines  Drug Company, a corporation organized under  the laws of the Philippine  Islands,  appeared  and asked leave to intervene as an interested party.  This leave being granted, it alleged that it is the actual owner of the pharmacy situated in the leased premises, which formerly belonged to the defendant A. S. Watson &amp; Company, Ltd.;  and that the defendant sublet to it the ground floor of the leased property under the same conditions  as are expressed in the original contract of lease.  The intervener further alleged, as did the defendant,  the  necessity for the removal  of the wall in question in order to give it more space as required by its  business, and that the removal of this wall was authorized in Paragraph M of the original lease.<\/p>\n<p>The trial court, after considering the evidence presented, making  a  personal inspection  of the leased  premises, and hearing the arguments of counsel for both parties, and after making its findings of facts and conclusions of law, entered the following decree, to wit:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The court denies the rescission and declaration of nullity  of the contract of lease demanded  by  the  plaintiffs, declaring such contract of lease to be valid and subsisting and binding upon the parties thereto, and upon the  sub-lessee and intervener, the Philippines Drug Company, and continues and declares final the preliminary writ of injunction issued herein on the 12th day of April, 1911, but modifying the  same by permitting the defendant, A. S. Watson &amp; Co. Ltd., or the intervener, the Philippines Drug Company, to remove the wall  in question on  the condition  that they substitute it with properly constructed concrete pillars and arches and such other  work as may  be  necessary as specified in Finding No. 17 of this judgment using such temporary shoring and bracing as shall be necessary to insure the safety  of the building while such change is being made,  which work of  removal and  substitution may be commenced and carried out upon the defendant or intervener, or both,  filing  herein  an undertaking in the  sum of P10,000 with sureties approved by the court, conditioned that it or they will reimburse the plaintiff lessors for any and all damage that may be caused the leased premises by a failure to take proper precautions and employ proper means to safeguard and protect  the building while  such work of removal and substitution is being accomplished.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>From this judgment the plaintiffs appealed  and make the following assignment  of errors:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"1. The  judgment is erroneous in not having declared rescinded the contract of lease.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. The judgment is erroneous in finding that the lessee and sublessee have the right to change the form and substance of the property leased.<\/p>\n<p>\"3.  The judgment is erroneous in finding that the lessee acted in good faith in beginning the destruction of the wall. believing that under the contract of lease it had the right to do this.<\/p>\n<p>\"4.  The judgment  is erroneous  in not  finding that  the building is weakened by the destruction of the wall.<\/p>\n<p>\"5.  The judgment is erroneous is so far as it modifies the preliminary injunction.<\/p>\n<p>\"6.  The judgment is erroneous in  not declaring perpetual the preliminary injunction.<\/p>\n<p>\"7.  The judgment  is erroneous  in the  dispositive part thereof relating  to the form and  manner of making  the modifications in  the  property because it  does  not  relate to anything  at issue in the case.<\/p>\n<p>\"8.  The judgment  is erroneous  in the  part relating to the form and manner of making the modifications  in  the property because it does not dispose of  anything judicially, but, on  the  contrary,  gives  permission  to  the opposing parties without commanding them  to do anything.<\/p>\n<p>\"9.  The judgment is erroneous because it does not order the repair of the destruction made  in the wall.<\/p>\n<p>\"10. The judgment is erroneous because it declares valid the contract  of lease.<\/p>\n<p>\"11. The court erred in denying the motion for  a new trial.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>All questions in this case may be merged into one, and that is:  Did the trial court err in failing to declare the contract of  lease voidable  or rescinded  for  one of two reasons: first, because of the minority of one of the lessors; and second, because neither the  defendant nor intervener had authority under the contract of lease to remove the wall in question?  Plaintiffs  do not  now insist that the contract  of lease was  terminated on the payment of the mortgage.<\/p>\n<p>The eight  plaintiffs each have a one-eighth  undivided interest in the leased  premises.   The property was  leased to the defendant for a period of twelve years with permission to renew the lease for  a  further period of  six  years.  Seven of these plaintiffs were of age when they executed this contract of lease.   The other, Antonio, Gascon, was a minor.  At the time this contract  of lease was executed, the minor was represented by his judicial guardian.  The guardian having obtained  authority  or permission of the court to enter into this contract of  lease for and on behalf  of  his ward, the action of the guardian  in executing said  contract  was approved  by the probate court.<\/p>\n<p>Article 1548 of the Civil Code reads :<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ART. 1548. The husband can not give in lease the property  of  the wife, the father and guardian, that of  the son or minor, and the  administrator of  property, not having a special power, for a period exceeding six years.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Article 398  of the same code provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Art. 398.  The decision of  a majority of the co-owners as to the management and better enjoyment  of the thing owned in common shall  be obligatory.<\/p>\n<p>\"There shall be no majority, unless the resolution has been adopted  by the co-owners representing a majority of the interests which constitute the object of the community.<\/p>\n<p>\"Should  there be no  majority, or  the resolution of the latter is seriously prejudicial to  the  parties interested in the thing owned in common, the judge, at the instance of a party, shall decree what may  be proper,  including the appointment of an administrator.\"<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">*       *       *        *       *      *       *<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Counsel for the plaintiffs do not claim that the contract of lease which was made  for a  period  of more than six years is seriously prejudicial to the interests of the minor, nor do  they claim that said  contract, of itself, prejudices in any way the minor's interest.<\/p>\n<p>The supreme court  of Spain  had  under  consideration this very question in its resolution of April 26, 1907 (vol. 15 Jurisprudencia referente  al Codigo Civil, p. 194).  In this  case, a contract of lease for twelve  years, executed by one of the co-owners of a certain property, one of whom was  a minor, had been  presented for registry.  Registry was, refused for the reason, among others, that the majority of the co-owners lacked authority  to execute said contract of lease.  It was argued that  the majority of the co-owners, in their enjoyment of the control of the management and  administration  of the thing, acted in a representative or an administrative capacity in regard to the minority.  In determining the questions presented in this case, the court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That for the administration and  better enjoyment of the  thing, the decision of the majority of the co-owners is obligatory, and that there  is no majority,  unless the decision is made by the co-owners, that  represent the majority of the  interests that constitute the object of the community, are general rules  laid down in article  398 of the Civil Code, governing community of property.<\/p>\n<p>\"The contract of lease  is by its  nature  and  purpose one  of  the means  of  enjoyment or development  of  non-fungible property, and, in  this concept,  may  be  agreed upon by the co-owners of  a thing, provided always  that they represent a majority of the interests of the community, the  decision being obligatory  for  all by virtue  of  the powers that are expressly  conferred upon them by virtue of said provisions.<\/p>\n<p>\"If,  indeed, the  contract of lease of real  property  for a  period exceeding six years,  or in which the rents  are advanced  for more than  three years, constitutes  a  real right inasmuch as it  is subject to  registry,  according to the decision of this court in  various resolutions, this principle of law, which has been applied  in the  sense, of not permitting, the execution of  such a  contract to  those  who administer the goods of others, and especially  to  prevent agents  from executing such a contract without  special authority for the same, in  accordance  with the  provisions of article  1713 of the said code,  is  not  opposed  to the principle of  law laid down in  said  article  398;  taking into  consideration the legal  character and peculiar attributes of community of property, which makes it  convenient and  necessary that those  who have less interest  therein should submit to those who have a greater participation   therein, in all that refers to the exploitation and ordinary enjoyment of the  same, the rule is  established that the enjoyment of the  common thing must be subject to the will  of the  majority, without distinguishing and  limiting the period or  the form of the enjoyment; therefore, the contract of lease  being the same in essence whatever the term for  which it is constituted, such a contract must be considered as an act of mere administration, and subject to  contract by the decision  of the  majority of coowners, the other interested  parties  always having the right to appeal  to the  court  when  the  decision is  gravely prejudicial to them according to the provisions  of the same article 398.<\/p>\n<p>\"This doctrine was recognized by the supreme court in its decision of June 30, 1897, and of the 8th of July, 1902, and by this court in its resolution of May 29, 1906, considering as  included in the powers conferred in  said article, leases exceeding a period of six years, decided upon by a  majority of  the co-owners  of a  property possessed in common.<\/p>\n<p>\"The  contract of lease of  the  property referred  to in these proceedings, having been agreed upon by the co-owners representing the majority of the interests in the  same, they were possessed of sufficient  legal capacity by virtue of  what is  already said, and it is, therefore, subject to registry.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the execution of the contract of lease under consideration, the minor was, as we have said, represented by his judicial  guardian, who not only asked the court for and obtained authority to  execute this contract  of lease on behalf of his  ward, but his act, after the execution, was approved by the court.  The interest of the minor has  not been prejudiced by reason of the fact that this contract of lease was  executed  for a term  of more than six years. Under the doctrine laid down by  the  supreme court of Spain, it would appear that this  contract of  lease would be  valid if the minor had not been represented by  his guardian.  The minor  having  been represented by his duly appointed guardian, there can be  no question about the validity of this contract of lease.<\/p>\n<p>The principal question  is whether or not the appellees have violated the terms of the contract of lease and thereby entitle the  appellants to have  said  contract of  lease rescinded.<\/p>\n<p>Before  considering the contract  in  question, it  might be well to examine the right of the  lessee to make changes in the property leased, if there were no express stipulation therefor in the contract.<\/p>\n<p>Article  1573  of the Civil Code provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A  lessee  shall have, with regard to the  useful and voluntary improvements, the same rights  which are granted the usufructuary.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Article  487 of the same code reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\"The usufructuary may make on the property which is the object of the usufruct any improvements, useful or for recreation, which he may deem proper,  provided he does not change its  form or substance;   but  he  shall have no right  to be  indemnified therefor.   He may,  however, remove  said improvements, should  it be possible to do so without injury to the property.\"<\/blockquote>The result is that the  lessee may make  any improvements, useful or for recreation,  in the property leased that he may deem proper, provided that  he does not change its form  or substance.  The same  obligation is  expressed in articles 487 and 489, and in so far as the form of the thing is concerned, in article 1557.  According to articles 487 and 3557, the obligations of the lessee and the lessor are the same in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, in so far as the conservation of the form  of the thing leased is concerned.  This question of conserving the form and substance of the thing leased or the object of the usufruct has been passed upon at various times by the courts.\n<p>In the case of the Manila Building and Loan Association and Penalosa (13 Phil. Rep., 575), this court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If the object leased were a house, it is evident that the lessee might effect such improvements for use, recreation or            comfort as would not change its form or substance  as he deemed fit; he could build a tower or luxurious pavilion more expensive than the house itself, to which, at the expiration of the lease,  the owner of the house would have no right whatever, unless the lessee could not remove the same without injury to'the house to which it was attached  as an improvement, excepting of course the right to cause the same to be demolished so that the house might be returned to him in the same condition that the lessee received it;   *   *  *.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The supreme court of Spain, in its judgment of June 24, 1905,  volume 14 of the Jurisprudencia  referente  al Codigo Civil, page 38, had  under consideration the interpretation of this phrase in a case in which the  lessee asked for the rescission of the lease  because  the  lessor had altered the form  of the thing leased.  The facts were that  the lessee had leased the house for the period of ten years, and at the time of the execution of the contract of lease, there was a vacant lot next  to the house and 13 windows  of  the house leased overlooked this  lot.   Thereafter the owner of the adjacent lot constructed an edifice thereon which gave rise to litigation between the lessor and the owner of the adjacent lot, which litigation was settled by the lessor and the owner of  the said lot, the latter being permitted to  cover the windows of the leased property, and the former allowed to open  in the  partition wall  of the  latter's  garden two large and two small windows of specified dimensions, under certain conditions.   The construction was continued, with the result that such  construction  effectually closed and covered the  13  windows and  the  balcony, depriving the property leased of the light previously received by the same. For the purpose of obtaining  better light, many changes were  made and much  work done in  the interior of the leased house, the final result being that some of the rooms of the house were darkened completely, others receiving poor and indirect ventilation.  The court, in refusing to rescind the contract of lease, said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It  does not appear that there is error committed by the trial court in its decision as set out in the first assignment of error, because, even though the noncompliance by the lessor of his obligations, among which was that of maintaining the lessee in the peaceable enjoyment of the lease during the period of the contract,  and the prohibition to change the form of the thing leased, confers upon the lessee the right to ask for the rescission of the contract, such circumstances are not found in the present case since the trial court says that the appellant was not disturbed in the possession of the house, the  object of the lease,  nor was he impeded from using the  premises  as  a tavern, for which  use he had intended the same,  and these  findings  of fact  have not been legally  impugned.<\/p>\n<p>\"The decision  also states that the changes made  in the property did not change the form of the same in the sense and concept covered by article 1557 of the Civil Code.  Notwithstanding that the findings  on the point contain legal leasoning now corresponding to  this  court, the interpretation of this article can not be made in general aiad absolute terms not defined by law, because as a circumstantial fact depending in each case on the peculiar conditions of the thing leased, there exists no reason in the case at bar upon which to base the conclusion that the trial court erred, having in mind that the particular use of the same as a tavern was not interfered with, as held in its  decision, and also the fact set out in its decision,  and not contradicted in any manner, namely, that the changes and alterations made were  beneficial, tolerated by Sabay, and consented to by the person to whom Sabay  transferred his  rights under the contract of sublease.<\/p>\n<p>\"The last two reasons given for the  rescission of the contract lack force and weight, because, in accordance with the sense and concept of article 1561 of the said Civil Code, the property must be returned at the expiration of the term of lease with the changes made in the  same, and these do not involve, as has  already been said, any variation or change of form or any interruption of the peaceable enjoyment of the lease and because it does not appear from the facts that the trial court accepted as proven that the  appellant suffered disturbance of his rights for which he had been compelled to become responsible to the lessor, and he,  not having done so, there is no legal reason to apply, as is attempted, the provisions of article 1560 of the code referred to.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Manresa, in volume 10 of his commentaries on the Civil Code, pages 534, 535, [488,  489] says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The question was discussed very energetically as to whether the lessee of a city property leased for a stated industrial purpose,\u00a0 could install machinery propelled by steam in substitution for the utilities, implements, and contrivances which were used  before  the  general  adoption of such machinery.  The installation of  modern machinery  and its ordinary operation, at once caused a deterioration to the estate much greater than the  use of the former apparatus, besides the accidents which might occur and which produce very great damage to the thing leased. Therefore, based upon this consideration, it  was said that the  lessee  could not make this  substitution because it implied a bad and prejudicial use of the thing and therefore very different from that diligence of a  good father  in its use to  which he had obligated himself.<\/p>\n<p>\"As Laurent says, there arise here two contrary interests and two diverse tendencies.  The owner has  in view  the stability of the structure and  fears every innovation which may compromise its preservation.   The manufacturer finds himself obliged  to keep abreast of the development  of his industry, to make changes, if he does not wish to perish, and his interests demand that he  put into practice the inventions which increase his profits, even though the edifice may suffer.  The owner conmmences  to resist,  adds this writer,  but  competition forces the manufacturer, and  the owner ends by yielding, if he does not wish to remain  unproductive.<\/p>\n<p>\"This is the essence of the policy pursued by foreign decisions, where  the question has been so much more important than in our own country.  Until the year 1860, judicial decisions were inclined  to favor the owner of the property. But from that year the rights of industry have been  recognized with ever increasing clearness.  It has been considered that from the  moment the lease is drawn up, in which is stated the industrial use to which the lessee desires to put the thing leased, the claims of the industry to which the object of the lease is to be devoted have been determined, and the lessee can not be condemned to a stagnation which would be uneconomical, and, these facts admitted, the logical consequences must necessarily follow:  the lessor can not prevent the lessee from adopting the improvements of his industry; the acts of the parties in making the stipulations in the lease will do the rest.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The lessee may make on the property which is the object of the lease any  improvements, useful or  for  recreation, which he may deem proper, provided he does not change its form or substance. He is obligated to use the thing leased as a  diligent father of a family would, and to return the thing leased at the expiration of the lease in the same condition in which he received it, except what  may have  been destroyed  or  impaired by time or unavoidable  reasons. (Arts. 1573, 487, 1555,  and 1561, Civil Code.)<\/p>\n<p>The supreme court of Spain recognizes the fact that  no ironclad  rules for the interpretation of these articles can be laid down which would govern all cases.   These provisions must be applied according to the facts and circumstances of  each case.  Manresa is inclined to the view that industrial development should be taken into consideration in the determination of questions involved in the  application of said articles.   The provisions of  these articles  are  general rules of law,  and,  like most general  propositions, are not to be accepted without limitation or reserve, under any and all circumstances.  They  must be interpreted  in the light  of the growth of civilization and varying  conditions. Certain obligations are placed upon the lessee  to prevent lawless acts which would  result in waste or destruction. The importance of these obligations to the lessor cannot  be denied. Especially are they valuable and  essential to the          protection of a landlord who rents his premises for a short time.  Suppose he has fitted his premises for certain uses and leases them for such uses for a short term.  He would then be entitled to receive them back at the end of the term still fitted for  those same uses, and he may well say that he does not  choose to have a different property returned to him from that which he  leased, even if it be found to be of greater value by  reason  of the  change. But suppose that a usufructuary who has  a life interest  in an estate should receive as such a hemp hacienda, and that in a short time this hacienda should become permanently unproductive through disease or death of the plants, or by change of the market conditions, and the  land to have become  far more valuable,  by reason of new conditions, as rice  or sugar land.  Is  the usufructuary to be compelled  to preserve or renew the useless hemp fields and forego  the advantages to be  derived  from a different use?  Or,  suppose a  life tenant should change warehouses  into dwelling houses on the ground  that  by  change of conditions the demand for warehouses had ceased and the property had become worthless, whereas  it  would be very valuable when  fitted  for dwelling houses.  Would this be such a change in the form or substance of the thing leased as to forfeit the interest of the  tenant?  Again,  a lessee for a <em>long<\/em>  term  received, during very prosperous times, a hemp hacienda upon which were constructed large and  valuable storehouses  in which were the old style hand-presses, but new.  Later, on account of a complete change in conditions due to the market and the method of  pressing hemp by steam, the lessee allowed the buildings and presses,  which had become useless, to fall into decay rather than incur the expense of repair.  Would a prudent owner  of the fee, if in possession, have done the same ?  These questions naturally suggest their own answer. The  radical  and permanent changes of surrounding conditions  must always be an important consideration  in  the determination  of such questions.   The interpretation that \"if  the man is too long  for  the bed his head should be chopped off rather than enlarge the  old bed  or  purchase a new one\" should not be given those provisions of the Civil Code regarding the obligations of lessees.<\/p>\n<p>Let us now turn to the contract of lease and the evidence presented.  In this contract of lease there are two clauses which deserve careful consideration.<\/p>\n<p>Clause K:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"All the expenditures  for cleaning, painting, and repairs which the building may require and all that is ordered done by the Board of Health, will be at the expense of the lessee, A. S.  Watson  and Company, Limited.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Clause M:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The lessee may make such works on the building as the business which it has established therein requires,  provided always that neither the  strength nor the value of the said building is impaired.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It will be noted that the word \"reparaciones\" is used in Clause K, and  the word \"obras\" in Clause M.  Counsel 'for the appellants  insist that the word \"obras\" as thus used means the same as  \"reparaciones.\"  The Encyclopedic Dictionary of  the Castilian Language  (Diccionario  Enciclopedico de la Lengua Castellana)  defines these words as follows :<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p align=\"left\">\"OBRA:<\/p>\n<p>\"1. A thing  made or produced by  an agent.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">*       *      *       *       *       *       *<\/p>\n<p>\"4. A building in course of construction.<\/p>\n<p>\"REPARACION:<\/p>\n<p>\"1. The  action and effect of repair.  (<em>Reparar<\/em>\u2014verb: To mend, to straighten, or to correct the damage  suffered by something.)\"<\/p>\n<p>The  New Dictionary of the Castilian Language (Nuevo Diccionario  de la  Lengua Castellana)  defines the same words  as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\"OBRA:<\/p>\n<p>\"Anything made, created,  or  produced by some power or agent.  Any construction  of  architecture, masonry,  or carpentry, applied especially to buildings in course of construction  or repair,  as:  There are  three  jobs  in Calle Hortaleza.  Everything in,my house is disordered and topsyturvy because of the work.' <\/p>\n<p>\"REPARACION :<\/p>\n<p>\"The act or effect of  repairing  or of being repaired. The fact of repairing, in the sense of renewing or improving something.\"<\/p>\n<p>The only synonym given in this work for \"obra\" is \"produccion.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It may  be that  repairs  are included in the definition  of \"obras.\"  Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the word \"obras,\" used in its general sense, has a far  more comprehensive meaning  than just  simple repairs.<\/p>\n<p>Sections 290 and 293 of  the  Code  of Civil  Procedure, provide:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"SEC. 290. <em>Terms of a  writing presumed to be in their ordinary sense<\/em>.\u2014The terms  of a writing are presumed  to have  been used in  their primary and  general acceptation, but evidence is nevertheless admissible  that  they  have a local, technical or otherwise peculiar signification, and were so used and understood in the particular  instance, in which case the agreement must  be construed accordingly.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"SEC. 293. <em>Where intention of different parties to instrument not the same<\/em>.\u2014When the terms of an agreement have been  intended in  a different sense by the different parties to it, that sense is to prevail against either party in which he supposed the other  understood it;  and when different constructions of a  provision are  otherwise equally  proper, that is to  be taken which is the most favorable to the party in whose favor the provision was made.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In  the case at bar  no proof has been  presented tending to show that the word \"obras\" was  used in a technical  or special sense, or that  it has a local signification, and therefore,  it must be  considered as used in its  ordinary and general sense.  If  there exists any  ambiguity  and  if the meaning that the  appellants give to the word  \"obras\"  is proper, the meaning given by  the appellees is likewise proper, consequently, we must apply the rule laid down  in section 293, above quoted, for the reason that the  stipulation contained in Clause M of the contract is a stipulation in favor of the lessee.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for appellants insist that in order to define the meaning of the word \"obras\" we should refer  to the articles of the Civil Code that deal with contracts of lease.  This might be  done  in  those  cases where the intention of the parties could not be ascertained  from either the  contract itself or from the  conduct of the parties in executing and carrying out the same.   In the case at bar, all that is necessary  is to give a fair and reasonable interpretation to the meaning of Clause M of the contract of lease.  This clause contains certain limitations  on the exercise of the right  to make alterations  (obras) :  first, the alterations  (obras) proposed  to be  made must  be required by  the business; second, such alterations must not injure the solidity of the building;  and third, the same must not prejudice the value of the building.  But it is  insisted, as we  have said, that the word \"obras\" in Clause M must be interpreted to mean \"reparaciones\" as used in Clause K. , Clause K imposes upon the lessee the obligation to make the repairs required by the building for its conservation.   If the words have  exactly the same meaning and were intended by the parties to mean the same thing,  then the insertion of Clause M would only have  had the effect of giving to the lessee the right to keep the building in repair, when, as a matter of fact. Clause  K made it its duty to repair the building.  As we understand the contract, in Clause K a duty is imposed upon the lessee, while in Clause  M a right is given to it.  In  Clause K the word  \"reparaciones\" is used in connection with the duty, and in Clause M the word  \"obras\" is used in connection with  the  right.   If the contracting parties  had intended that the two words be used  in the same  sense they would have  so stated,  or  they would have eliminated  Clause  M entirely as being useless, as it is meaningless to say  that when a duty is  imposed upon a person it is necessary to expressly give him a right to perform that duty.  If he did       not have the right to perform that duty, the same would not have been  imposed upon him.   The stipulations in  Clause M are expressed as clearly and explicitly as they could have been under the circumstances.   At the time of the execution of this contract of lease,  it was impossible  to know what would be the requirements of the business during its term of eighteen years. It was likewise impossible for the parties  to have then agreed in detail as to the changes that, might  be necessary. The lessee wished to reserve  to itself the right  to make the changes in  the  property required by its business, and none of the parties could anticipate  what might be required  during this long period  of time.  This right was  conferred upon the  lessee  by the lessors, but the right, as we  have said, had its limitations: that is, the lessee could not prejudice  the solidity  or the value of the building without breaking the contract.<\/p>\n<p>The question was raised as to whether the conduct of the parties in carrying out the terms of this lease has been such as to show or indicate their  intention or understanding  of the meaning of the word \"obras\" when they  inserted this word in Clause M,  Upon this point the trial court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<em>That under and by virtue of the said contract  of lease<\/em>, the defendant company entered into possession of the leased premises, making therein alterations and  repairs  at a cost of some P60,000, including the removal of the whole front of the  building facing upon,  the Escolta and replacing the same upon  the new street line, established by the city  of Manila, with a modern  and  decorative commercial  front; the removal of the heavy tiled roof and the replacing of the same with  a light galvanized roof; the  removal of various walls and replacing the same with steel columns and girders; the tearing down and rebuilding of a part of the  building and the adding thereto of a camarin upon the Pasig  River; and the building  of a river wall and reclamation of  a considerable amount of ground;  and which alteration  included the removal of  that  part of the wall  in question  which extended from Point A to  Point G on  the  plan of the premises introduced in evidence as defendant's Exhibit No. 9, all of which repairs, alterations, and improvements, were made with the final approval of the plaintiffs, although after much controversy and many disagreements, and to which alterations and improvements the plaintiffs  contributed the sum of about eighteen  hundred pesos paid by the city of Manila for the expropriation  for street purposes of the small strip along the front of the building heretofore mentioned.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>These findings of fact are, we think, fully supported by the evidence.  The result is that these important and material changes, which include the removal of a great portion of the very wall in question, were made by virtue of the contract of lease itself.   It is true that the owners objected at first, but afterwards consented in accordance with the provisions of Clause M, and not by reason of any subsequent specific agreement.  After  all, that the defendants have the right under the law and the provisions of Clause M of the contract of lease  to remove the; wall in question, cannot be seriously doubted, provided always that neither the solidity of the building nor its  value be impaired.<\/p>\n<p>Let  us now determine whether or  not  a  removal of the wall in question  (1) will  prejudice either  the solidity of the building or its value, and  (2) if  it is required by the business of the defendants.<\/p>\n<p>The wall which the defendants and interveners propose to remove and substitute in lieu thereof other material is composed of two outer shells of Guadalupe or Meycauayan stone,  filled with lime,  plaster and rubber,  the two shells being bound together by stones laid transversely, the whole wall so formed being about  one meter thick and extending from the front of the building a  distance of about  38 meters toward the Pasig River.   This wall is about  four meters high, extending from the ground floor to the second floor.   The joists and girders supporting the second  floor are embedded in said wall.  There are  two actual openings  in this wall,  with  three  doors  and an  arch, which have been walled up.  The wall is in good  condition, except      that part removed by the defendants before the commencement of this action, and said wall is one of four longitudinal walls, all being approximately of the same  thickness.   The wall in question divides the east half of the ground floor of the building approximately in its center and sustains a part of the weight of the second floor of this  east half, together with  a partition  forming one of the divisions of the second floor.   But it does not sustain any of the weight of the roof, this weight  being distributed by  means of trusses to the outer  walls  of the building.  About one-third  of  this  wall,  or that part  nearest  the  Pasig, has already been removed, and  the removal of the  same was approved by the  owners.  The interveners  now propose to remove the  remaining two-thirds and substitute in lieu thereof other material, using the material  of the old wall for filling up certain openings in  other walls of the building.   This old  wall, according to the experts, offers very little resistance to lateral shocks or motions.  Practically all of  the resistance of lateral shocks or motions is furnished by the cross-walls.  Again, according to the opinion of the experts the building will  be greatly strengthened against earthquakes or  unusual shocks  or force, and  its durability increased by the removal of the  remaining part of the wall in question and the substitution in lieu thereof of reinforced concrete posts or pillars and arches, taking the material and filling, as the interveners propose to do, the openings in some  of the other walls.  Such  proposed removal,  if carried  out, will practically double  the  floor space  of  the drug store and greatly increase  its rental value,  and also greatly  increase  the actual value of the building.  This extra floor  space is absolutely  essential to the business  carried on in this part of the building.  The foregoing are substantially the findings of  the trial court, based upon the  testimony of expert witnesses, and an ocular inspection of the premises.  These facts  show clearly and beyond a question that  the  removal of the remainder of this old wall will not only  not prejudice the solidity of the building,  but greatly increase its  solidity  and  durability, as, according to the opinion of the experts, the reinforced concrete posts and arches  will offer  greater  resistance to earthquakes or baguios than  the  old wall; that both  the intrinsic and rental value of the building will be increased; and that this removal is required by the business.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, counsel for the appellants say:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The plaintiffs contend that a contract is only binding on the parties thereto as provided in article 1257  of  the Civil Code  and that, although a sublessee is bound  to  the lessor as provided  in articles  1551 and  1552 yet this is not an obligation arising out of contract but one founded in law and  the relation of the parties  to property, and that the lessor has  no obligation towards the sublessee as such at all either legal  or of contract and that therefore even if by  clause (<em>m<\/em>) of the  lease the  plaintiffs  had the obligation to permit the defendant to take out the wall to suit the  convenience of its own business, that such an obligation was purely personal between the parties  to  the lease and since the contract of lease is not assignable this right could not be transferred by defendant or made  use of by defendant for the benefit of other persons.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>A lease may be of things, works, or services.   (Art. 1542, Civil Code.)   In a lease of things, one  of the parties thereto binds  himself to give to  the other the enjoyment or  use of a thing for a specified time and for a fixed price.  (Art. 1543, <em>idem<\/em>.)<\/p>\n<p>Article 1550 of the Civil Code reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Should it not be expressly forbidden  in the contract of lease of things, the lessee  may  sublet  the whole or a part of the things leased  without prejudice to his liability for the fulfillment of the contract executed with the lessor.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>There is  nothing in the contract of lease in the case at bar which  even tends  to  prohibit the lessee  from sub-letting the whole or any part of the leased premises.  The lessee's right to do this cannot be  questioned, and  his subtenant is not only obligated to  carry out his part  of the contract with the sublessor, but  he  is also bound  to the lessors for all of the  acts  which refer to  the use and            preservation of the premises, in the manner agreed upon between the lessors and the lessee.   The lessors can compel the subtenant to comply with these  conditions.  This sets up the privity between  the lessors and the subtenant. But it  is  said  that the  contract of  lease in question is not assignable.   This  contract is an  ordinary one, under which the  lessee as we have said,  has  a perfect  right to sublet the whole of the  premises  for  the entire time. Should the lessee do this, would it not amount to an assignment of the contract of lease?   The power of assignment is incident to the  state of  every lessee  of things, unless he has been restrained by the terms of his lease.   In  the contract of lease in question, the  lessors, by  Clause M, agree that the lessee may make  such changes as its business requires, provided that neither  the  solidity nor  the value of  the building  is  prejudiced.  This is  a  specific right granted to the lessee.  This right is a part of  the lease itself and affects directly  the  thing leased.  It is not, therefore, a personal obligation  between the lessors and the  lessee.<\/p>\n<p>We  are,  therefore,  of the opinion that the  judgment appealed from should be affirmed with costs  against  the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Johnson, Carson,<\/em>  and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<em>Arellano, C.

S. Watson &amp; Co., or the intervener,  The Philippines  Drug Company, to remove  the wall in question on condition that they  replace it by pillars and arches of reinforced concrete, with the remaining circumstances set forth.<\/p>\n<p>In my opinion this point in the judgment appealed from should be  reversed by  sustaining  the  injunction  issued by  the  court and ordering  the  destroyed wall  to be  restored to the form  and condition it previously had.<\/p>\n<p>The destruction of this wall amounts to a change in form and an  essential modification of the condition of solidity the poperty had before it was removed.   The best proof that it was not expedient to remove the wall was being torn down, the building was propped up and<br\/>\n  another wall erected to replace the one taken out.<\/p>\n<p>Article 1557 of the Civil code prescribes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The lessor can not change the form of the thing leased.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Article 1561 thereof says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The lessee must return the estate at the expiration of the lease in the same condition in which he received it, except what maay have been destroyed or impaired by the time or by unavoidable reasons.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the contract of lease appears the following Clause M:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The leasing company may perform on the property the work required by the business ir has established therein, provided that the solidity of the building is not damaged or its value affected.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The defendants proceeded to tear down said wall in violation of the provisions of the law and the agreement in the contract of lease, for the clause quoted does not authorize them to destroy the central wall of the building, even  with the intention of replacing it by another wall of concrete,  and in doing so they changed the form of the building and performed work not authorized in the contract, and which essentially affects the solidity of the building.<\/p>\n<p>Even though said cluase provides that the leasing company perfom the work required by the business it has established therein, yet the same clause says: provided that the solidity  of the building is not damaged or its value affected. By tearing down the wall in question and changing its form as the central support of the whole weight of the second story and of the framework of the roof, the defendant company   undoubtedly performed work which essentially affects the solidity and the value of the structure.<\/p>\n<p>The convenience of the tenant, not admitted by the owner, is no legal reason or cause whereby the former may after the condition of the property, as there was no express stipulation that the said wall might be torn down, it is impossible to assert that the leasing company has nt violated the contract and the legal provision which protects the right of the owner, who should in no sense be at  the mercy of the caprice and convenience of the tenant, for that would give rise to a genuine transgression upon he right of property.<\/p>\n<p>One of the obligations of lease under article 1555 is to use the thing leased like a  careful  householder by applying it to the use agreed upon, and, in default of agreement, to use that may be inferred from the nature of the thing leased according to the custom of the land.  There is no custom in this country whereby a tenant may without permission pf the owner tear down in this way a central wall that upholds  building.<\/p>\n<p>In a country like this, where the ground is frequently shaken  y an enormous internal force, causing violent earthquaakes, it is customary to build for the solidity of  the structure walls of size an extent such as that of the property in question, which was destroyed by the defendant party by and for itself.  In spite of the defects ascribed thereto, it is sufficient to assert that said wall has withstood al the violent earthquakes that have occured during the latter half of the past century, and yet it was arbitrarily torn  down without the knowledge and consent of the owners and in spite  of n injunction of the court, not because it was not solid but because  it was thick and wide and took up a good deal of space in the place which the defendant company wished to use to its full extent.  A concrete wall, with which the destroyed stone was replaced, would be more convinient for the interests of the defendant because it would take up less room, but the solidity of concrete walls in this land of earthquakes has not yet received stamp of conclusive test in one of those violent phenomena, happily not yet experienced since the concrete building have been erected here.  But if the will of the parties is the law in contracts not contrary to law,  morality and public order, and in cases not foreseen by the interested parties, the rules and provisions of law that protect the reciprocal rights and duties of the contracting parties, the leasing company unquestionably had  no right to tear down the  wall in question and replace it  by another of concrete without the  consent and against  the express objection of the owners of the property.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore,  I  think that the  first part of the judgment appealed from should be affirmed and that the second part, referring to the authorization therein  conferred  upon  the defendant party to remove the wall in question and replace it  by another of concrete with the conditions  set forth, ought to be reversed and the defendant party ordered to replace  the destroyed wall  in  the form and condition it formerly had, with the \"costs against the defendant party.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

This fact\u00a0 was sustained by the\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 of three or four witnesses. The defendant presented no proof to the contrary.<\/p><p> The attorney for the defendant, in his brief in this court, alleges that the\u00a0 proof\u00a0 presented\u00a0 during the trial of the cause fails to show that the substance found in the possession of the defendant was opium ashes.\u00a0 By reference to page 9 of the record, it will be seen that by mutual agreement the substance found in the possession of the defendant was referred to\u00a0 the Bureau of Science for analysis.\u00a0 By reference to page 10 it will be seen that\u00a0 the Bureau of Science made a report\u00a0 which shows that the said Bureau analyzed said substance and found the same to be\u00a0 opium ashes.\u00a0\u00a0 No objection whatever was made to the sufficiency or to the form of the report of said\u00a0 analysis.\u00a0 The attorney for the appellant attempts to make it appear now that the report was not sufficient.\u00a0 No objection was\u00a0 made\u00a0 in the court below to the form or substance of said report.\u00a0 The objection should have been made at\u00a0 the time the said analysis was\u00a0 presented.\u00a0 Had the\u00a0 objection been presented at that time,\u00a0 the prosecuting attorney might have secured\u00a0 a report in proper form.\u00a0 The objection seems to be too late now, especially when the same relates purely to the form of the report and\u00a0 not to its substance.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 The\u00a0 attorney for the\u00a0 appellant makes the further objection, to wit: That the stenographer who\u00a0 took the notes during the trial of the cause did not transcribe the same nor certify to the correctness of the\u00a0 transcription.\u00a0 It appears that some time after the trial, Mr.\u00a0 W. M. Barrington, the stenographer who took the notes and before the same were transcribed, died.\u00a0\u00a0 Later\u00a0 another stenographer, Mr. Forrest Clark,\u00a0 who signs himself as official stenographer of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila,\u00a0 transcribed the said notes and certified that said transcription is a full and correct transcript of said notes, to the best of his knowledge and belief, taken by Mr. Barrington in said cause.\u00a0 It is a well known fact that stenographic notes taken by one stenographer can not\u00a0 always be read and transcribed by another.\u00a0 However, where stenographers use the same system of stenography, the notes taken by one may be read by another\u00a0 familiar with that system.\u00a0\u00a0 In the present\u00a0 case, in view\u00a0 of the certificate of Mr. Clark (the stenographer who transcribed the notes of Mr. Barrington)\u00a0 and in the absence\u00a0 of proof to the effect that the transcription is not a correct transcription of the,notes taken by the former stenographer, we see no objection in accepting the same as being a true and correct transcription of the notes taken of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause.<\/p><p> From all of the facts of the record, and\u00a0 with due consideration to the defense\u00a0 made by\u00a0 the appellant in this court,\u00a0 we are of the\u00a0 opinion that the sentence of the lower court should be affirmed, with costs.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

The act occurred in the municipality of San Isidro, Province of Nueva Ecija, P. I., in violation of law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The present action was commenced on the 5th of June, 1909, in the court of the justice of the peace of the pueblo of San Isidro, Province of Nueva Ecija. The complaint was presented and signed by the prosecuting attorney of said province. The justice of the peace held a preliminary examination and found that there was probable cause for believing that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged and held him for trial in the Court of First Instance of said province.<br\/><br\/>On the 27th day of September, 1909, the above complaint was filed in the Court of First Instance of said province by the prosecuting attorney. No complaint was presented either by the aggrieved person or by her parents, grandparents, or guardian, in accordance with the provisions of section 1 of Act No. 1773, neither in the court of the justice of the peace nor in the Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the Honorable Julio Llorente, judge, found the defendant guilty of the crime, with the aggravating circumstance of a grave abuse of confidence, and sentenced him to be imprisoned for a period of two years eleven months and eleven days of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, with the accessories of the law, to recognize and maintain the child of Virginia Gonzales, and to pay to the said Virginia Gonzales the sum of P500, in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>From that sentence the defendant appealed and assigned as error in this court that the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause was not sufficient to show that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged.<br\/><br\/>During the pendency of the cause in this court and probably after the brief of the appellant had been printed, he presented a motion asking that said cause be dismissed for the reason that the complaint presented in the court below had not been presented by the offended party, her parents, grandparents, or guardian. The consideration of this motion was deferred until the cause should be presented upon its merits.<br\/><br\/>Section 1 of Act No. 1773 provides that the crimes of <i>adulterio, estupro, rapto, violacion, calumnia<\/i>, and <i>injuria<\/i>, as defined by the Penal Code, shall be deemed to be public crimes, and shall be prosecuted in the same manner as all other crimes under said code, with the proviso that the prosecution of the crimes of <i>adulterio, estupro<\/i>, and <i>injuria<\/i>, committed <i>against persons other than public officials or employees<\/i>, shall not be instituted except upon the complaint of the aggrieved person, or of the parents, grandparents or guardian of such person.<br\/><br\/>This court has held in the following cases: U.

Chiong was conducting  a  business in  Santo Cristo street, No. 216,  in the  city of Manila,  and was indebted to  the plaintiffs herein in the sum of P1,700.<\/p>\n<p>Upon that date the said Chiong sold said business to the said Quibiao,  with the consent and knowledge  of the plaintiffs, upon the following conditions:<\/p>\n<p>That Quibiao  should  assume the payment of the  said indebtedness,  which was, by agreement between him and the plaintiffs herein, reduced to the sum of P880, to be paid at the rate of P80  per month, and  that the said Quibiao should give a guaranty for the payment of the said sum of P880 together with  the value of whatever other goods and merchandise the \"plaintiffs might sell to him (Quibiao).<\/p>\n<p>In accordance with this agreement between the plaintiffs and Quibiao, the  other defendants, Silverio Jiongco y Felix and Sotera  Roco y De Vera, executed and delivered a contract of guaranty (Exhibit A), by which they guaranteed the payment of the  said sum of P880, in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the plaintiffs and Quibiao,  as  well as the payment  for any goods, wares  and merchandise sold by the plaintiffs to Quibiao up to the sum of P3,000.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant,  Quibiao, failed to comply with his agreement  with the plaintiffs  herein,  whereupon  the present action  was  commenced.  The plaintiffs  claim  that the amount due by reason of the failure of Quibiao to pay the monthly installments, together with the value of the goods sold by the plaintiffs to him, is P1,279.99.<\/p>\n<p>After hearing the evidence  adduced during the trial of the cause, the Honorable Simplicio del Rosario, judge, found that there was due from the defendant, Quibiao, to the plaintiffs, the  sum of  P1,279.99, and  that the guarantors, under their contract of guaranty, were jointly and severally liable with him for the payment of the said  amount, together with costs.<\/p>\n<p>From that judgment the defendant Quibiao appealed. The apellant in his brief attempts to show that Quibiao is not responsible for the payment  of the sum of P880, for the reason that the provisions of section  335 of  the  Code of Procedure in Civil Actions had not been complied with. It will be noted, however, that no objection was made in the court below to the admissibility of the evidence showing Quibiao's liability.  Section 335 relates to the form of the proof simply. If the parties permit the fact to be proved by evidence other than that provided for by said section 335, it is then too late  for them to object for the first  time in this court as to the  form of the proof.<\/p>\n<p>In the contract of guaranty executed and delivered by the defendants Silverio Jiongco y Felix and  Sotera Roco y De Vera, two  parcels of land described in the first and second paragraphs of said contract were given in guaranty for the payment  of the obligation resulting  under  said contract.  The lower court evidently treated this contract (Exhibit A) as a mortgage lien upon said parcels of land. The document (Exhibit A) was not recorded in the registry of property and can not  be considered as a mortgage, and the lands can  not, therefore, be subjected  to the  payment of the judgment herein, under the provisions of the Civil Code, upon the theory that said contract was a mortgage, but can only be subjected  to the payment of the judgment herein under an execution.  The contract of guaranty (Exhibit A) did not constitute a mortgage upon said property.<\/p>\n<p>In our  opinion, with the modifications hereinbefore suggested,  the judgment of the lower court should be and is hereby affirmed.<\/p>\n<p><em> Arellano, C.

He also asked that, for the purposes\u00a0 of\u00a0 the warranty of title, the vendor, Joaquin\u00a0 de Castro, be notified and\u00a0 summoned to appear within the term prescribed by law to answer the said complaint.<\/p><p>Joaquin de Castro appeared and by a writing of July 31, 1911, set forth, in answer to the complaint: that he denied generally\u00a0 and specifically\u00a0 all\u00a0 the fundamental\u00a0 grounds thereof; that, on April 26, 1911,\u00a0 he sold to the defendant, Guerrero, the lands in question, of\u00a0 which he had been the possessor and\u00a0 proprietor prior to such sale; and\u00a0 that, on account of his being obliged to defend his title to said lands, the plaintiff had\u00a0 caused\u00a0 him\u00a0 damages\u00a0 to the extent of P100; therefore, he asked that he, as well\u00a0 as the defendant, be absolved\u00a0 from the complaint and that the plaintiff, for malicious\u00a0 prosecution,\u00a0 be sentenced to pay hini\u00a0 P100 as damages and the costs of the suit.<\/p><p>After the trial and\u00a0 the presentation\u00a0 of\u00a0 evidence, both oral and documentary,\u00a0 by the parties, the exhibits\u00a0 being made a part of the record, the court, on September 29,1911, rendered judgment absolving the defendant, Gregorio Guerrero, from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff, Remigio Nicolas.\u00a0\u00a0 The latter, by\u00a0 a written motion of\u00a0 October 9, 1911, took exception to, and\u00a0 asked for the annulment of, the judgment and moved for a new trial. This motion was overruled by an order\u00a0 of the 16th of the same month and year, exception thereto was taken by the plaintiff, the proper bill of\u00a0 exceptions was\u00a0 presented and approved,\u00a0 certified and\u00a0 transmitted to\u00a0 the clerk of this court,\u00a0 together with the trial record.<\/p><p>A question of fact is\u00a0 involved in this litigation, that is, as to who is the real owner of the two parcels of land which the plaintiff claims from\u00a0 the defendant.\u00a0 The former claims that although he acquired them from the\u00a0 latter by purchase, the vendor took possession of the same to the prejudice of the vendee's interests.<\/p><p>By Exhibits A, B, and C, pages 1, 2, and 3 of the record, the\u00a0 plaintiff, Remigio\u00a0 Nicolas,\u00a0 endeavored\u00a0 to prove\u00a0 his ownership of the two parcels of land averred to have been sold to him by their previous owner, the defendant Gregorio Guerrero.\u00a0 He alleged that\u00a0 the purchase of those estates was effected\u00a0 on May 15, 1909; that the transfer of ownership was recorded in an\u00a0 instrument drawn up in his house on the same date in the presence of Pantaleon Nicolas, that it was written by Mariano Matias on top of a trunk in the house,\u00a0 and that at the very time the contract was made the vendor received the\u00a0 price of the sale.\u00a0 Pantaleon Nicolas corroborated these statements of\u00a0 the plaintiff, yet stated that he was present when a receipt was made out by Mariano Matias, relative to the sale made by his uncle, the plaintiff, of some\u00a0 lands\u00a0 which were sold to the latter on that occasion by\u00a0 Gregorio Guerrero, the defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 Mariano Matias did not testify, as he has since died.<\/p><p>With regard to the document proving the\u00a0 sale of the said parcels of land, the plaintiff stated in an affidavit that he could not exhibit it, as it had been lost with his pocketbook which had been carried away by the current of the river north of Dingras on an occasion when, in\u00a0 crossing it, he was unexpectedly overtaken by\u00a0 a\u00a0 violent flood,\u00a0 and that he then went to the place where the said lands are situated, as he\u00a0 had been advised by Pantaleon Baoit that the same had been usurped\u00a0 by the defendant, Guerrero. The witness\u00a0 Pantaleon\u00a0 Baoit corroborated\u00a0 the plaintiff's statements, but\u00a0 related details whereby he contradicted and belied the averments of\u00a0 the plaintiff.<\/p><p>From what has been\u00a0 alleged\u00a0 and proved in this case, it appears that\u00a0 the original owner of the two parcels of land in\u00a0 question was Joaquin de Castro, who pledged them\u00a0 as security for a certain sum of money which he had received from the defendant, Gregorio Guerrero, wherefore the latter took\u00a0 charge of the lands as creditor-pledgee, in 1900, and so held them until\u00a0 the end of 1908 when they were redeemed by their owner, Joaquin de Castro, who stated to the defendant, so the latter testified, that he would transfer the pledge to Remigio Nicolas, but he did not know whether Nicolas came to possess\u00a0 the lands or not; but on April 26, 1911, Joaquin de Castro sold\u00a0 absolutely to Gregorio Guerrero the aforementioned two parcels of land, together with another\u00a0 one,\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 sum of ?=800 Philippine currency, according to a document written in the\u00a0 dialect of the province, Exhibit A, page 5 of the record, executed on the same date and translated on page 7 of the file of exhibits. This instrument bears\u00a0 the signatures of the vendor, his two children\u00a0 Esperanza and\u00a0 Juan Castro,\u00a0 his son-in-law Damaso Rubio,\u00a0 and of\u00a0 two witnesses who\u00a0 were\u00a0 present at its execution.\u00a0 After that date Guerrero again occupied and held the said lands,\u00a0 as owner thereof, and denied\u00a0 that he had sold\u00a0 them to the plaintiff, Nicolas, on May 15, 1909, for then he was not yet the owner of the property.\u00a0 The defendant testified that he signed the document presented by\u00a0 the plaintiff\u00a0 as Exhibit A, in the belief that it\u00a0 was an application\u00a0 to be relieved from\u00a0 the land tax,\u00a0 and added that while he held the land under the incumbrance before mentioned,\u00a0 he had paid the\u00a0 land tax thereon, but\u00a0 had ceased to do so after the property had been redeemed, and that the plaintiff then told him that he had bought the two parcels, wherefore witness\u00a0 signed the document,\u00a0 Exhibit A, presented by\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff,\u00a0 wherein he requested that\u00a0 he be no longer charged with\u00a0 the land tax\u00a0 assessed against the property.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 record\u00a0 likewise shows that\u00a0 in no\u00a0 wise could the defendant, Guerrero, have executed the alleged deed of sale, nor authorized any\u00a0 document whatever in the plaintiff's house in Laoag on the\u00a0 15th of May,\u00a0 1909,\u00a0 because on that date\u00a0 he was in the subprovince of Abra, in company with others, for the purpose of buying horses\u00a0 and\u00a0 cows, having left his residence on the 4th of May and not returning until the 27th of the same month,\u00a0 in proof whereof the exhibited certificates of animals acquired by the defendant Guerrero in Abra during the said month of May, 1909.<\/p><p>So that, not\u00a0 only does the defendant, Guerrero, deny the alleged contract contained in the said document as well as the execution of the same on the 15th of May, 1909, attesting to the\u00a0 sale of the lands in question, but also the record shows no proof that such document was executed, nor that the deed of\u00a0 sale was made, as alleged hy the plaintiff, in order to\u00a0 establish his\u00a0 claim of being the owner\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 lands.\u00a0 Furthermore,\u00a0 the pocketbook\u00a0 containing the said\u00a0 document cpuld not have\u00a0 been\u00a0 lost, as the plaintiff alleged, by being washed away by the current while he was crossing the Dingras River, because\u00a0 there\u00a0 was no freshet at\u00a0 the\u00a0 time and, according to\u00a0 information furnished by the official weather observer stationed at Laoag, it did not rain in Ilocos Norte\u00a0 on the 20th and 24th of June, 1911, but on\u00a0 the contrary, there was a\u00a0 clear sky, and\u00a0 only on the night of the\u00a0 last date, at a little after\u00a0 nine o'clock, it rained a trifle, the rain-gauge registering a small\u00a0 amount of\u00a0 water.\u00a0 As\u00a0 against\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony of the plaintiff that he\u00a0 crossed the said\u00a0 river at night,\u00a0 there\u00a0 is that\u00a0 of\u00a0 his witness, Pantaleon Baoit,\u00a0 to the effect that Nicolas arrived at the place where the land is situated, at about\u00a0 two o'clock in the afternoon, and that when he appeared there he had his s$id pocketbook with him,\u00a0 which\u00a0 was perfectly dry, and said nothing about any mishap in\u00a0 the river.\u00a0 Moreover, as\u00a0 against tfce\u00a0 plaintiff's\u00a0 statement\u00a0 that he started for Laoag about the 22d of June, 1911, his said witness testified that he sent notice to the\u00a0 plaintiff of the usurpation about the 5th of the following: month oi July.\u00a0 By all,the foregoing details\u00a0 it has been evidently demonstrated that the alleged sale through the execution of the said document of May 15,\u00a0 1909,\u00a0 was not made.<\/p><p>The evidence adduced in this case by the defendant fully and conclusively proves that he is the legitimate owner of the\u00a0 lands in question and\u00a0 that the plaintiff had\u00a0 not\u00a0 the slightest right to claim the\u00a0 same,\u00a0 with all the more reason since the original and\u00a0 real owner of the said lands was Joaquin\u00a0 de\u00a0 Castro, and in\u00a0 1909 the defendant,\u00a0 Guerrero, could not have conveyed his ownership to the plaintiff,\u00a0 for he was not then the owner\u00a0 of those parcels of land, which he acquired in April, 1911,\u00a0 and\u00a0 although he occupied them as creditor pledgee from\u00a0 1900 to\u00a0 1908, he had no right in such capacity to dispose\u00a0 of them, and\u00a0 much less in 1909, when the lands had already been redeemed and returned to their owner, Joaquin de Castro.<\/p><p>Proof\u00a0 of the facts averred in a complaint devolves upon the plaintiff, since each party must prove his\u00a0 own affirmative allegations.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art\u00a0 1214,\u00a0 Civil Code, and sec. 297, Code of Civil Procedure.)<\/p><p>The plaintiff has not substantiated the grounds on which he bases his complaint, while the\u00a0 defendant has furnished complete and satisfactory proof of his exceptions.<\/p><p>It was plainly a reckless action on the part of the plaintiff to have presumed to prosecute this suit on the pretense of proving his alleged right by means\u00a0 of\u00a0 a document which, according to the evidence adduced at the trial, never existed and was\u00a0 never executed.<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from should be, as it is hereby, affirmed,\u00a0 with the costs of this instance\u00a0 against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em> Arellano, C.

SONG FO &amp; COMPANY ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is a suit brought under the provisions of Act No. 666 of the Philippine Commission, in which the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the defendants in the use of a certain trademark, and for damages consequent upon the alleged illegal use of the same. The plaintiff company is a general partnership duly organized under the laws of the Philippine Islands and is the owner of a distillery in the city of Manila known as the \"Destileria de Tanduay.\" The defendants are the members of a general partnership duly organized according to the provisions of law, and are the owners and operators of a distillery in the city of Manila known as the \"Destileria La Tonde\u00f1a.\" Both firms are extensively engaged in the manufacture and sale of alcoholic liquors.<br\/><br\/>On October 6, 1903, plaintiffs caused to be registered in the division of archives, patents, copyrights and trademarks of the Government of the Philippine Islands a trademark for \"anisados y alcoholes\" as shown by Exhibit B. A sample or facsimile of this trade-mark is a part of the record and is marked \"Exhibit A.\" It is shown to be a circular design inclosed within two concentric circles with the symbol of a demijohn in the center; across the face of the design, running in a horizontal direction are two parallel lines, and between these lines the word \"Tanduay\" is placed thus: TANDUAY; this horizontal design serves to divide the trade-mark into an upper and lower section; in the upper part between the two circles appears the word \"Inchausti\" and in the lower arc of the design in a similar position is the word \"Compania.\" \"Y\" appears just underneath the symbol of the demijohn within the smaller circle. Labels bearing this trade-mark were affixed to the corks used by plaintiffs in the bottling of their products.<br\/><br\/>The defendants since 1906 have been using, among other labels, affixed to the corks used in the bottling of their products, a circular label bearing a design substantially similar to the registered trade-mark of plaintiffs. It is a label of practically the same size as that of plaintiffs. Its main features are two concentric circles having the symbol of a demijohn in the center; running across the face of the inner circle is a horizontal design similar to that in plaintiffs' registered trade-mark in which is written the abbreviation for factory, thus: FACT. The main difference in the two horizontal designs lies in the fact that in plaintiffs' registered trade-mark the horizontal design passes across the entire face of both circles, while in the trade-mark used by defendants the horizontal design passes only across the face of the inner circle. The wording of the two designs is different, but the general position of the wording is the same in both designs. The trade-marks appear to have been used in different colors and for the same purpose by both parties. The trade-mark used by defendants is shown in Exhibits C, CC, and CCC of the record. These trademarks are the same in general design, but vary in color and wording.<br\/><br\/>Reference to the certificate of registration (Exhibit B) which was granted to the plaintiff company by the division of archives, patents, copyrights and trade-marks of the Government of the Philippine Islands and to the facsimile copy of the trade-mark filed therewith shows that all the requirements of law were duly complied with, and that all the statements and declarations relating thereto, together with facsimile copies of the trade-mark, were duly registered. We have before us a certified copy of all the registration proceedings. The facsimile of the trade-mark which was presented for registration and which is affixed to the copy of the registration proceedings (Exhibit B) is substantially identical ia all respects to the trade-mark shown in Exhibit A. It is maintained with considerable zeal in appellants' brief that the description of the trademark as shown in the registration proceedings is not an accurate description of all details of the trade-mark claimed by appellees (Exhibit A) and that the granting of a certificate of registration for the trade-mark described in Exhibit B would not cover plaintiffs' trade-mark (Exhibit A). To determine this point we do not look alone to the description given in the registration proceedings; we must look to the whole record. A facsimile copy of the trademark sought to be registered was filed with the registration office, and it is now a part of the certified copy of the registration proceedings (Exhibit B) before us. As we have already stated, this facsimile copy which is an integral part of the registration records is substantially identical in all respects to plaintiffs' trade-mark (Exhibit A). We do not feel therefore that it is necessary to discuss appellants' contention that the description as given in the registration proceedings does not in all of its details cover plaintiffs' Exhibit A. The certified facsimile speaks for itself, and this together with the description is conclusive upon this point.<br\/><br\/>Defendants' counsel insist that Inchausti &amp; Co. did not have the right to adopt as their exclusive trade-mark the design shown in Exhibit A, and that it was error on the part of the lower court to adjudge that they had such a right.<br\/><br\/>In support of this contention they rely upon the generally accepted rule that a symbol which represents something in universal use by the public generally, or by a particular class of the people, is not the subject of an exclusive trademark. It is shown by Exhibit 9 that many other firms and business houses in the Philippine Islands use circular labels; some of these having designs of which two or more concentric circles form a constituent element, others having horizontal lines across the face of a circular design somewhat similar to plaintiffs' design in this respect. It is urged that the demijohn is the only distinguishing element in plaintiffs' trade-mark upon which they could have been granted an exclusive trade-mark; and it is further contended that a demijohn being a well-known and generally used receptacle for alcoholic liquors, and being universally used by the distilling trade, plaintiffs for that reason are not entitled to the use of the same as a distinguishing symbol and trade-mark for their products. Many citations are given in support of this contention, and we do not question the soundness of the doctrine laid down in most of these cases.<br\/><br\/>But that plaintiffs are entitled to the exclusive use of the above-described trade-mark upon their products does not seem to us to be open to question. While the symbol of a demijohn alone might not be the subject of an exclusive trade-mark, yet we think that a demijohn used as it is in plaintiffs' trade-mark in combination with the other distinguishing elements therein may fairly be made the subject of an exclusive trade-mark. The component elements of a design are not to be considered separate and apart; we must look to the design as a whole; to the combination of those component elements. We are of opinion that the design shown in Exhibit A is the subject of an exclusive trade-mark, and that the plaintiffs have the exclusive ownership and right of use in the same by reason of the registration thereof and their use of this trade-mark in the sale of their products for many years.<br\/><br\/>We come now to a consideration of the question whether or not the trade-marks used by defendants shown in Exhibits C, CC, and CCC are infringements of plaintiffs' registered trade-mark. The court below predicated its decision upon sections 3 and 4 of Act No. 666 of the Philippine Commission. These sections relate to the violation of trade-mark rights and to remedies thereunder. Among other provisions of section 3 of the trade-mark law is the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"* * * any person entitled to the exclusive use of a trade-mark to designate the origin or ownership of goods he has made or deals in may recover damages in a civil action from any person who has sold goods of a similar kind, bearing such trade-mark, * * *.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The section further provides for the method of determining the damages, and also concedes to the injured party the right to have an injunction restraining the further use of the trade-mark. The court below was evidently of the opinion that the trade-mark used by the defendants not only closely simulated the registered trade-mark of plaintiffs, but that they were in reality one and the same trademark and that the defendants were guilty of selling goods of a similar kind to those sold by plaintiffs and bearing the registered trade-mark used by plaintiffs. An examination of the two trade-marks in question reveals a striking similarity in the two designs, but we are not prepared to say that the likeness is such that the two designs could be considered one and the same trade-mark. And unless there is such a close resemblance as to result in this conclusion the action does not properly fall within the provisions of section 3 of the Trade-Mark Law. The reasoning of the opinion of the trial judge, however, does not in any way affect the merits of the issues involved in the case submitted, nor the judgment actually entered by him. Section 7 of the Trade-Mark Law provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote> \"Any person who in selling his goods shall give them the general appearance of the goods of another manufacturer or dealer, either in the wrapping of the packages in which they are contained, or the devices or words thereon, or in any other feature of their appearance, which would be likely to influence purchasers to believe that the goods offered are those of a manufacturer or dealer other than the actual manufacturer or dealer, and who clothes the goods with such appearance for the purpose of deceiving the public and defrauding another of his legitimate trade * * * shall be guilty of unfair competition, and shall be liable to an action for damages * * * and in order that the action shall lie under this section, actual intent to deceive the public and defraud a competitor shall affirmatively appear on the part of the person sought to be made liable, but such intent may be inferred from similarity in the appearance of the goods as packed or offered for sale to those of the complaining party.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It will be seen that the measure of damages is to be determined in the same way as that provided in section 3, and the right of the complaining party to an injunction is the same as that provided for in cases of the violation of a trade-mark. The facts alleged in the complaint and proven at the trial sustain a judgment under either of these sections of Act No. 666. Section 3 relates to the actual use of the trade-mark of another, while section 7 relates to unfair competition, where a manufacturer or dealer either by the wrappings on a package, or by the words or devices thereon, or by any other feature of their appearance gives his goods the appearance of those of another manufacturer or dealer with the intent to deceive the public or defraud such other dealer or manufacturer out of his legitimate trade. For reasons already stated we are of opinion that the present case comes within the provisions of section 7 of the Trade-Mark Law.<br\/><br\/>We come now to apply the facts of the case to the provisions of law as they are set forth in section 7 of said Act No. 666. An examination of the labels used by the parties to this action shows that they are strikingly similar in their general design and appearance. We have already had occasion in the course of this opinion to give a rather minute description of both designs, and as facsimile copies of the same appear in the record we have had the opportunity to examine them. There are some details in which the two trade-marks vary, but in many and indeed in most important and essential details they are identical. Both designs have the demijohn as a central figure surrounded by two concentric circles. The horizontal planes which pass over the face of both designs differ only in length; in plaintiffs' design this plane terminates in the circumference of the outer circle, while in that of the defendants it terminates in the circumference of the inner circle. We can not escape the conclusion that the two trade-marks are so nearly alike in design and general appearance that only the most careful examination could detect that they were not in fact the same. Such an examination discloses the points of difference, but it is to be remembered that the purchasing public has, ordinarily, no such opportunity to make such an examination nor is there any reason to impose such an obligation on the public. In the case of U. S. vs. Manuel (7 Phil. Rep., 221) this court said:<br\/><blockquote> \"The true test of unfair competition is whether certain goods have been intentionally clothed with an appearance which is likely to deceive the ordinary purchaser exercising ordinary care, and not whether a certain limited class of purchasers with special knowledge not possessed by the ordinary purchaser could avoid mistake by the exercise of this special knowledge.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>A person thoroughly familiar with the details of design in plaintiffs' trade-mark, and exercising special care in examining the goods offered for sale and the wording used on the trade-mark, would hardly be deceived by the trademark used by the defendants. It certainly could be only in the exercise of such careful scrutiny as this, however, that an intending purchaser could assure himself that the two labels were different. We are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the similarity of the two labels, and the further fact that they are affixed in the same way by both parties to the corks used in the bottling of their products, would be the means of influencing the purchaser to believe that the goods offered by the defendants were those of plaintiff's manufacture. We are of opinion that the charge of unfair competition is fully sustained by the record. The similarity in the appearance of the goods as packed and offered for sale is so striking that we are unable to attribute this fact to anything other than an intent on the part of defendants to deceive the public and defraud plaintiffs out of their legitimate trade, and in this case we infer such intent from the likeness of the goods so packed and offered for sale.<br\/><br\/>The lower court directed that the defendants render an account to the plaintiffs of the profits which they had derived from the sale of their alcoholic liquors under the trade-mark in question, in accordance with the provisions of the Trade-Mark Law. It appears, however, that the parties hereto have agreed, for the purpose of this appeal, that the measure of profits shall be reckoned at the sum of P1,000. The judgment of the lower court is therefore affirmed, except in so far as it makes provision for the taking of an account, and in so far as it thus provides for the taking of an account, the judgment, in accord with the agreement of the parties on appeal, is modified by substituting therefor judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants for the sum of P1,000. The costs of the proceedings in both instances are allowed in favor of the plaintiff company and against the defendants.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur. <\/div>",

The court\u00a0 erred in imposing the costs\u00a0 upon the oppositor.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>With reference to the\u00a0 first\u00a0 assignment of error above noted, it appears from the record that upon the 13th day of January,\u00a0 1910, Emigdio Zarate executed his last will and testament, the original of which appears in the record and is marked \"Exhibit A.\"\u00a0 Emigdio Zarate died on the 19th day of January,\u00a0 1910.<\/p><p>From an\u00a0 examination of said Exhibit A it appears to have been signed by Emigdio Zarate and by four witnesses, Sabino M. Sandoval, Esteban Sandoval, George Zarate\u00a0 and Eugenio Zarate.\u00a0\u00a0 From the record it appears that the testator\u00a0 dictated his will in the Pangasinan dialect and it was then translated\u00a0 into\u00a0 Spanish.\u00a0 After the will had\u00a0 been written in Spanish it was read to the deceased and translated to him in the Pangasinan dialect, and, according: to the allegations of the appellee, the said Exhibit A received his approval\u00a0 as his last will and testament.<\/p><p>The appellant alleges that at the time of the execution of the said alleged will of Emigdio Zarate, he was not in the full possession of his mental faculties.\u00a0 This question was presented to the lower court.\u00a0 After hearing the evidence, the lower court found that Emigdio Zarate, at the time of the execution of the said will, was in the possession of his faculties.\u00a0\u00a0 Two of the witnesses who signed the\u00a0 will,\u00a0 as well as others who were present in the house at the time the said will was executed, testified that in their opinion Emigdio Zarate was of sound mind and memory at the\u00a0 time\u00a0 he signed the said will.\u00a0 Practically the only testimony to the contrary adduced during the trial of the cause in the lower court was the testimony given by two doctors, one of whom had not\u00a0 seen\u00a0 the deceased\u00a0 for many months before his death, whose testimony was based wholly upon hypothetical questions.<\/p><p>The appellant\u00a0 attempted to show\u00a0 that Emigdio Zarate for some\u00a0 months prior to his death had been troubled with insomnia, as well as some other physical infirmities.\u00a0 The hypothetical questions were based upon the question whether or not a person who had been suffering with\u00a0 insomnia for some months would have sufficient mental capacity to\u00a0 execute a will.\u00a0 The two doctors who appeared on behalf of the opponents testified that insomnia tended to destroy the mental capacity, but that there were times, even during the period while they were suffering from insomnia, when they would be perfectly rational.\u00a0\u00a0 Even admitting that there was some foundation\u00a0 for the supposition\u00a0 that Emigdio Zarate had suffered from the alleged infirmities, we do not believe that the testimony was sufficiently direct and positive, based upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 hypothetical questions, to overcome the positive and direct testimony of the witnesses who were present\u00a0 at the time\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 execution\u00a0 of the will\u00a0 in question.\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence adduced during the trial of the case, shows a large preponderance of proof in favor of the fact that Emigdio Zarate was in the full possession of his mental faculties at the time he executed his last will and testament.<\/p><p>The second and third assignments\u00a0 of error may\u00a0 be considered together.\u00a0 Upon the question\u00a0 presented by the said assignments of error,\u00a0 the lower court found from the evidence that Emigdio Zarate executed his last will and testament without threats, force or pressure or illegal influence. The basis of the claim that undue influence had been exercised over Emigdio Zarate is that a day or two before the said will was\u00a0 made, it is claimed by the opponent, Maria Calderon, that the deceased promised to will to her a certain house (one-half of which seems to belong to her) upon the payment by her to the deceased of the sum\u00a0 of P300.\u00a0 The P3O0 was never paid to the deceased and the said property was not willed to the defendant herein.\u00a0 The agreement between Maria Calderon and the\u00a0 deceased, if there was an agreement, seems to have been made between them privately, at least at the time the will was made the deceased made no reference to it whatever.\u00a0 Those\u00a0 present at the time the will was made\u00a0 and the witnesses who signed the same heard no statement or conversation\u00a0 relating to the said agreement, between the opponent herein and the deceased. There is no proof in the record which shows that any person even spoke to the deceased with reference to the willing of the said\u00a0 house to the\u00a0 opponent.\u00a0\u00a0 There is nothing in the record to indicate in the slightest degree that any\u00a0 person interested in the will,\u00a0 or who was present at the time of the making of the\u00a0 same,\u00a0 induced or\u00a0 attempted to\u00a0 induce the deceased not to will the said house to\u00a0 the opponent herein.\u00a0 The theory of the opponent that the deceased did not will to her the house in question is a mere presumption and there is not a scintilla of evidence in\u00a0 the record to support it.<\/p><p>The fourth, fifth,\u00a0 and sixth assignments of error may be considered\u00a0 together.<\/p><p>During the trial of the cause two of the persons who signed the will as witnesses appeared and testified.\u00a0 They testified that the deceased signed the will in their presence and in the presence of the other witnesses to the will; that they each\u00a0 signed the will in the\u00a0 presence of the\u00a0 testator and in the presence of the other witnesses;\u00a0 that the other two witnesses who were\u00a0 not called also signed the will in the\u00a0 presence of the testator and\u00a0 in\u00a0 the presence\u00a0 of each of the other witnesses.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no sufficient proof in the record to overcome the declarations of these witnesses.\u00a0\u00a0 We find no reason, therefore, for modifying the conclusion of the lower court upon these assignments of error.<\/p><p>With reference to\u00a0 the seventh\u00a0 assignment of error, to wit:\u00a0 that the court erred in rendering judgment\u00a0 without waiting for the written arguments of both parties, it may be said that it\u00a0 is customary for\u00a0 courts\u00a0 to\u00a0 wait until\u00a0 the parties have presented their arguments before deciding a cause, nevertheless, it is not reversible error for\u00a0 a court to decide a cause without waiting for written arguments to be presented\u00a0 by the\u00a0 respective attorneys.\u00a0 It\u00a0 appears from the record (p. 102) that\u00a0 the trial of\u00a0 the cause was closed on the 5th of August, 1910, and that the\u00a0 decision in the cause was not rendered until\u00a0 the 5th of October, 1910, or until after\u00a0 two months had expired.\u00a0 There is nothing in\u00a0 the record which shows that either of the attorneys during these two months\u00a0 asked for additional time in which to present their written arguments.\u00a0 It also\u00a0 appears of record (p. 102) that the respective attorneys asked for fifteen days' time within which to present their written arguments.\u00a0\u00a0 There\u00a0 is nothing in the\u00a0 record which shows whether they presented their written arguments\u00a0 or not. If there was any fault for not having the written arguments presented before the decision was rendered in the cause, it was clearly not the fault of the judge.<\/p><p>The arguments heretofore given seem to be sufficient also to answer the eighth and\u00a0 ninth assignments\u00a0 of error.<\/p><p>Upon a\u00a0 full consideration of the evidence and\u00a0 the\u00a0 assignments\u00a0 of error,\u00a0 we are of the opinion that the will of Emigdio Zarate, deceased,\u00a0 was executed and signed in entire conformity with all\u00a0 the requirements and\u00a0 solemnities required by law.\u00a0 Therefore the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 of the lower court is hereby affirmed with costs.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

S. Crossfield,  judge, granted the  writ as prayed  for,  from which order the Collector of Customs appealed  to this court.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<p>It appears from the record that some time prior to the commencement  of the action in the lower court, a Chinaman by the name of Chieng Ah Soon,  who claimed to be a merchant doing  business' at Nos. 79 and  81 Calle  San Jacinto, in the city of Manila, returned from China bringing with him two  boys, named respectively  Chieng Ah Lui, 20 years of age, and Chieng Ah Sui, 16 years of age.   These boys, Chieng  Ah Lui and Chieng Ah  Sui,  were at first denied  admission into  the Philippine Islands.   An  investigation was held by the  board of special inquiry,  which board, after hearing all of the  witnesses which the father, Ah  Soon, desired to present, found that the said Ah  Lui was the son of Ah Soon and therefore admitted him.  The board, from the evidence,  found that Ah  Sui was not the son  of  Ah  Soon, and  refused him admission.  From that decision Ah Soon appealed to the Insular Collector of Customs, the Honorable H. B. McCoy, who,  upon due  investigation, found  that Ah Sui was  not the  person that he represented himself to be and was not the son of Ah Soon, and  therefore confirmed the decision of the board of special inquiry.<\/p>\n<p>Upon petition a second hearing was accorded by the board of special inquiry, and again it was decided that Ah Sui was  not the son of  Ah Soon, and therefore not entitled to enter the Philippine Islands.  Again an appeal was made to the Insular Collector of Customs, who again confirmed the finding of the board of special inquiry.<\/p>\n<p>A third hearing was  asked for and granted by the Collector of Customs.   Upon  the third hearing the board of special inquiry, after hearing all of the evidence which Ah Soon offered, again  found that Ah Sui was not entitled to enter the Philippine Islands.  A third appeal was taken to the Insular Collector of Customs, and again the finding of the board of special  inquiry was affirmed.<\/p>\n<p>A  fourth hearing was asked for on the part of Ah  Soon, which was denied by the Insular Collector of Customs in the following language:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In  reply to yours dated the 14th instant (September, 1910)  requesting a rehearing in the case of Chieng Ah Sui, I have to inform you that in this case the records show that three separate and distinct hearings have been given, at each of which testimony was introduced on behalf of the applicant, and the record of each of these hearings discloses the fact that all of the witnesses presented were heard.  It would  seem that this applicant has had  every reasonable and necessary opportunity to  present any testimony which tended to prove his right to enter the  Philippine Islands. These  hearings were  held on  July 19 and 23, and  August 10, while  the decision of the Insular Collector  of Customs upon the appeal therefrom was not rendered until September 3,  one and a half months after the first hearing.   It would  appear that even reasonable diligence would have secured the attendance of any necessary or competent witnesses  within the time stated  prior to the decision of this case on September 3.<\/p>\n<p>\"For the foregoing reasons the application for rehearing is denied.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p align=\"right\">(Signed)   \"H. B,  MCCOY,<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p align=\"right\"><em>\"Insular Collector of Customs\"<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>From the third decision  of Colonel  McCoy,  as Insular Collector of Customs, an appeal was taken to the Court of First Instance, and there some proof was taken in  addition to that submitted before the board of special inquiry. Upon the record in the present case, the right of the Court of First Instance to take evidence in addition to that presented  to the board of special inquiry is very questionable indeed. In  the present case, however, the  judge of the Court  of First Instance declared that the testimony taken before  him in no way influenced his judgment in declaring that the applicant was entitled to the writ of habeas corpus.<\/p>\n<p>Several  Chinese witnesses before the board of special inquiry claimed that they knew Ah Soon and  his family in China; that they lived in the same  town and  swore that he had several children, among whom was the boy Ah Sui. It appears also from the record that some months prior to the time when Ah Soon returned to the Philippine Islands with the two boys Chieng Ah Lui and Chieng Ah Sui, and upon leaving the  Philippine Islands for China,  he made a declaration which was placed on file  in the office of  the Insular Collector  of Customs, in which he gave the names of the members of his family.  The name  of Ah  Sui did not appear then as a  member of his family.  Ah Sui was sixteen years of age.   If he were a member  of  the family when Ah Soon returned to the Philippine Islands, he must have been a member of the  family a few months  theretofore.  Children do not reach the age  of sixteen  years in a few months.  Some objection was  made to the right of the board of, special inquiry  to take notice of said declaration presented by Ah Soon in relation to the members of his family.  The  declaration constituted a part  of the records of the office of the Insular Collector of Customs.  The board of special  inquiry is  a board  connected with that branch of the Government and it had a perfect right to take judicial notice of  relevant factg found  in their records.<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the Insular Collector of Customs in no way abused the discretion conferred upon him in reaching the conclusion that Chieng  Ah Sui was not  the son of Ah  Soon and was, therefore,  not entitled  to enter the Philippine Islands.<\/p>\n<p>Upon all of the facts contained in  the record, we are of the opinion that the order of the lower court admitting into the Philippine Islands the Chinese  boy, Chieng Ah  Sui, should be revoked, and that an order should issue that  the said Chieng Ah Sui  should be returned to  the  custody of the Insular Collector of Customs, in order that  he may be deported, in accordance with the law.

Mandac was arrested and the court  fixed the amount of the bail to be given at P10,000.  On the  21st of that month, the appellants, Nemesio Bonoan, Evaristo G, Clemente, Septimo Villanueva, and Ignacio Arzaga, entered into a recognizance  or bond  to the  United States in that sum, conditioned that \"the above-named defendant, Simeon Mandac, will appear and answer the charge above mentioned in whatever court it may be  tried,  and that he will at all times hold himself amenable to the orders and processes of the court, and  if convicted  will  appear for judgment and render  himself to the execution and satisfaction thereof, and in  case of failure to perform any of these conditions         that we will pay to the United States the sum of ten thousand pesos Philippine currency.\"  Mandac was thereupon released from custody.<\/p>\n<p>The case proceeded to trial and resulted in the defendant being found  guilty of the crime charged and sentenced accordingly.   From this judgment an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court.   This court issued the following order on August 18, 1910:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Upon presentation by the Attorney-General in case No. 6243 against Simeon Mandac  for  the  crime of homicide of a petition requesting that the appeal  be held to be abandoned and the sentence declared final and that the case be returned to the Court of First Instance for execution of the sentence, the court duly stated: In view of the  fact that the regulation period for the presentation of appellant's brief has  more than  elapsed without presentation thereof and  that according to the  investigation made the accused is apparently beyond the jurisdiction of this court, his present whereabouts Being absolutely unknown, all of  which demonstrates  his purpose of hiding himself and of abandoning  his appeal, the petition of the public prosecutor is granted, the  appeal entered by the  accused  declared abandoned, with costs, and the judgment appealed from to be final, and that the case be forthwith remanded to the court of origin for execution of the judgment.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The record was returned to the lower court as directed and that court issued an order on September 3 (Saturday), 1910, directing the appellants to present at once their principal, Mandac, for the purpose of commencing to serve the sentence imposed upon him.  On Monday, September 5, the appellants appeared and stated in writing  that they were unable to present the  said Mandac in so short a time.  On the same day, September 5, an order forfeiting the bond was  entered  and the  appellants given thirty days  within which to give a satisfactory explanation of why their principal had failed to appear.   On the 15th of that month the appellants asked for an extension of time, which was denied      on the 23d; and they then filed a document setting forth at some length the reasons why they had been unable to present the said Mandac as directed.   These reasons were considered insufficient, and final judgment was entered on October, 31, and the provincial fiscal directed to proceed against sufficient of the property of these bondsmen to  satisfy the amount of said bond.  From this  order  or judgment the bondsmen appealed.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel now insists that the appellants should be relieved of all  responsibility in this case for  two reasons:  First, because a new bond in the sum of P10,000 was substituted in lieu of the original bond;  and second, for the reason that when they, the appellants, were called upon on September 3 to present the body of their principal, he was then held by the authorities in the Province of Nueva Vizcaya on a charge of bandolerismo, and that said authorities refused to give him up.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the first proposition, it is sufficient to say that the alleged bond which the appellants claim was substituted in place of the one signed by them never was accepted or approved by the court.   Bondsmen can not be relieved by merely presenting or causing to be presented an alleged bond which has never been approved.  Such a document has no place in the record.<\/p>\n<p>The  second question is not so easily disposed of.   It is admitted by all parties that at the very time when the lower court issued the order of September 3 directing the bondsmen to present in  court without delay the body of the said Mandac, he was then legally held by the Government in the Province of Nueva Vizcaya on a charge of bandolerismo; that the said  authorities refused to turn him over to the appellant bondsmen for the purpose of presenting him tp the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte; and that the first time these  appellants had  ever been called upon by the court to present the said Mandac was on September 8, 1910.<\/p>\n<p>The  United States,  the  plaintiff in  the homicide  case against Mandac, was the obligee in the bond.  The same plaintiff and obliged caused the arrest and confinement of Mandac in Nueva Vizcaya on a charge of <em>bandolerismo<\/em> and refused to deliver him up  to the appellants.  It would be against all principle and justice to allow the Government to recover against the sureties for not producing their principal when it had itself placed the principal beyond their reach and control.  There was an implied covenant on the part of the Government when the bond was accepted that it would not in any way interfere with the due compliance of the conditions in the bond or take any proceeding against the principal which would affect the rights of the sureties.   (Reese vs. U. S., 76 U. S., 13, citing Rathbone <em>vs.<\/em> Warren, 10 Johns., 586; Niblo <em>vs.<\/em> Clark, 3 Wend., 24; S. C., on error, 6 Wend., 236; Bowmaker <em>vs.<\/em> Moore, 7 Price, 223; S. C, 3 Price, 214.)<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is the settled law of this class of cases that the bail will be exonerated where the performance of the condition is rendered impossible by  the  act of God, the <em>act of the obligee,<\/em> or the act  of the  law.\"  (Taylor <em>vs.<\/em> Taintor, 83 U. S., 366.) <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The Government had a perfect right to arrest and hold Mandac in the Province of Nueva Vizcaya on that charge of <em>bandolerismo.<\/em>  It also had  the right to decline to surrender him to these appellants.  But it can not by these acts prevent the fulfillment of the conditions  in the  bond by the sureties, and at the same time force the sureties to pay the amount of the bond.<\/p>\n<p>It is said that the conditions of the bond  were violated prior to the time that the principal Mandac was rearrested. This contention is based upon the conduct of the said Mandac from about the 24th of June, 1910, up until September 1, 1910, the day  of his rearrest.   The facts upon this point are these: Mandac came to  Manila  on or about May 29, 1910, and remained until  about June 24,  1910,  when he disappeared.  His bondsmen, who were residents of Ilocos Norte, became alarmed about  their  principal's remaining in Manila so long,  so one  of them came to this city prepared to  arrest or cause the arrest  qf the  said Mandac. When he  arrived Mandac  could not be found.  The next         time Mandac was heard of he was in one of the northern provinces organizing a band of outlaws.  He succeeded in perfecting to some extent  this organization, and  he and his band committed various  depredations, including the robbing of a municipal treasury, the carrying away of certain animals and other property of private individuals, and the kidnaping of a number of priests.  He caused so much disturbance  in the northern  provinces  that the  Government was forced to and did send out a large force of the Philippine Constabulary to arrest or destroy this band. These quasi military operations cost the Government large sums of money.  The band was finally broken up and a number of its members captured, including the leader, Mandac. It was for these depredations that Mandac was held in confinement and finally tried by the Court of First Instance of Nueva Vizcaya.   The bondsmen assisted in every way  they possibly could in the capture  of Mandac.  Do these facts constitute a breach of that condition of the bond wherein  it is stated that  \"he (Mandac)  will at all times hold himself amenable to the orders and processes of the court?\"<\/p>\n<p>Let it be said that if the bondsmen had been called upon by the court at any time between the latter part of June and the first of September to present their principal that they could not have done so.   (We cannot tell from the record whether, as a matter  of fact, they could have done so or not.)   This being true, would they be liable on the bond under the condition that they obligated themselves to see that their principal would at all times hold himself amenable to the orders and processes of the court, when they had not been called upon by the court to  present their principal?   In other words, when is the liability of the bail fixed?<\/p>\n<p>The form of the bond in this case is in accordance with the provisions of section 67, General  Orders, No. 58.  Section 76, ibid., reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"SEC. 76. If without sufficient cause the defendant neglects to appear for arraignment,  trial or judgment, or neglects to appear on any other occasion when his presence may be        required in ceurt, or fails to surrender himself in execution of the judgment, the court must direct the fact of his neglect or  failure to be entered in  the records of the cause,  and declare the undertaking or deposit, as the case may be, to be  forfeited.  But if at% any time within thirty days thereafter the defendant or his counsel appears and satisfactorily explains the neglect or failure, the court may direct the forfeiture to be discharged upon such terms as it may consider just.  If the forfeiture is not so discharged, the promotor fiscal shall at once proceed by action against the bail upon their undertaking.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>From the reading of this section  it will  be seen that certain things must be done before execution  can  issue to satisfy the amount of the bond: First, if the defendant fails or  neglects to appear on any occasion when  his presence may be required by  the court, or fails to surrender himself in execution of the judgment, an order forfeiting the bond or the deposit must be entered; second, the court shall then notify the bondsmen and give them thirty days within which to present the  body  of their principal; third,  if the bondsmen do not present  the defendant within that time and do not satisfactorily  explain  the reasons therefor, the court must then render judgment against the bondsmen for the amount represented  in the  bond.  In other words, no judgment can  be rendered against the bondsmen until they have been given a hearing, and they are not required to present their principal until called upon to do so by the court. A final  judgment against the  bondsmen cannot be  entered unless such judgment is preceded by an order of forfeiture and an opportunity given  tKe bondsmen to present their principal or to give a satisfactory reason for their inability to do so.  The conditions of the bond are not that the principal will conduct himself during the pendency of the action as a law-abiding citizen or as a Christian gentleman,  but that he will appear and answer the charge against him and that he will hold himself amenable  to the orders and processes of the court, and, if  convicted, will appear for judgment and render himself to the execution and satisfaction thereof.  These are the conditions undertaken and entered into by the appellants' in this case.  They did not guarantee that Mandac would commit no crime while he was at liberty. It is true that by the bond Mandac was, in the theory of the law, committed to the custody of his sureties as jailers of his own choosing.  Not that he was, in point of fact, subjected or could be subjected to constant imprisonment  by them; but he was so far placed in  their power that  they could have arrested him at any time and surrendered him to the court.   The rights  and liabilities of sureties on a recognizance or bail bond  are, in  many respects, different from those of sureties on ordinary  bonds or commercial contracts.   The former can discharge themselves from liability by surrendering their principal; the latter, as a general rule, can only be released by payment of the debt or performance of the act stipulated.  But in respect  to the limitations of their liability to the precise terms of their contract, and the manner of determining whether or not they have complied with those terms,  their positions are similar.  In both instances, the party charged with having violated  the terms of the obligation must be given an opportunity to comply with those terms before he can be held liable.<\/p>\n<p>In the order of this court  of August 18,1910, above copied, Mandac's appeal was declared deserted and it was dismissed, not upon the ground that he had  absconded, but upon the ground that he had failed  to  present his brief within the time required by the rules of this court.  It is  true that this court said in that order that according to the documents in the case it appeared that the defendant was beyond the jurisdiction  of this court,  his whereabouts being entirely unknown.  This statement was made, hot for the purpose of showing that  Mandac had  violated  the conditions of the bond, but for the purpose of showing that he had deserted his appeal.   This could not be  held to mean a declaration that the conditions of the bond had been violated, because the bondsmen were given no hearing upon the question at that      time; and furthermore, the presence of Mandac in this court was not necessary in order that his appeal might be heard and judgment rendered; nor did the sureties on his bail bond guarantee that he would be present in this court either before the hearing or after the hearing. (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Lewis, 2 Phil. Rep., 193.)<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Bandoy vs. Judge of First Instance (14 Phil. Rep., 620)  this court, speaking of the obligations imposed upon a defendant and his bondsmen when the former is released from custody  during the pendency of the action by virtue of a bond, said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The only obligation imposed upon' the  defendant, under the provisions of the law when  he is granted his liberty during the pendency of  the  cause of action against him, is that he will deliver himself to the  custody of the court whenever  he is called upon so to do, for the purpose of receiving the orders and  processes of the court.  The obligation imposed upon the bondsmen can not be greater nor of a different character.   To permit the imposition of other obligations upon  the defendant  in criminal actions  and upon his bondsmen, for the purpose of securing  his liberty under bail, than those provided  for  by law might result in  the imposition  of conditions  which would  absolutely prevent and render it impossible for the defendant to secure his  liberty during the trial, notwithstanding  the fact that he  is entitled to his liberty, as a matter of right.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Again, the bail bond is a contract between the  appellants and the Government, that, if the latter would release Mandac from custody, the former would and did undertake that \"he will at all times hold himself amenable to the orders and processes of the court.\"  Not that he would hold himself amenable to the orders and processes of any other entity or person.  Amenable is to  be liable to answer; responsible; answerable; liable to be called to  an account,  by  the court. There must necessarily be a call before an answer,  and an order before  it can be obeyed.  None were  given  by the court prior to September 3d,  and the  appellants  cannot be held  liable for the failure of their principal to answer or comply  with the process or orders when none were given.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregQing reasons, we agree with the Attorney-General that the order appealed from should be reversed and the appellants relieved  of all liability, without costs.   So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><em>Johnson<\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ.,<\/em> dissent.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Urrutia &amp; Co., from a judgment rendered in this case by the Honorable A. S. Crossfield, judge.<\/p>\n<p>Under date of May 19, 1909, counsel for G. Urrutia and Company filed a  written complaint against  The  Pasig. Steamer and Lighter Co., wherein it was alleged that the plaintiff  company  was the owner of the steamer <em>Nuestra Senora del Pilar<\/em>, inscribed in the marine registry of the port of Manila; that the said vessel was provided with the proper license to navigate and trade in the waters of the  Philippines, was worth P80,000 in cash, and, on the dates mentioned in the complaint, was  carrying  a cargo valued at P45,000; that the defendant company  was the owner  of the steamer San Juan, inscribed in the marine registry of the port of Manila; that on or about December 6, 1908, while a storm was raging, the steamer <em>Nuestra Senora del Pilar<\/em>, belonging to the plaintiff, was navigating in the direction of the  port of Legaspi and, after twenty hours and thirty minutes, descried, toward Mal-Abrigo, a steamship which had signal flags hoisted, wherefore the Nuestra Senora del Pilar directed its course towards  the said vessel, which proved to be the San Juan displaying the signals M Y and L D, which mean: \"Am unable to navigate.  Will you tow me tp  a safe  anchorage?\" that  on that occasion, the steamer N<em>uestra Senora del Pilar<\/em>, with great risk to itself, rendered salvagNe service to the San Juan by taking it to a safe port, and  that, had it not been for  the opportune, prompt and efficacious aid lent by the <em>Nuestra Senora del Pilar, the San Juan <\/em>and its cargo would certainly have been totally lost; that the salved steamer, together with its cargo, was worth on the dates of the salvage  and the complaint P100,000, at a true cash valuation; that the just and adequate remuneration for the salvage service rendered by the <em>Nuestra Senora del Pilar<\/em> to the <em>San Juan<\/em> sum of P40,000; and that, notwithstanding that the plaintiff company had demanded of the defendant concern the payment of the said sum for the salvage  service referred to, and since the 15th of January, the defendant, without objecting to the amount of the plaintiff's claim, had not paid the same and had been delaying the payment  thereof under futile pretexts: wherefore, the plaintiff prayed that judgment be rendered in its behalf, to enable it to collect from the defendant the sum of P40,000, with legal interest thereon from January 15, and the costs.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant demurred to the foregoing complaint, and after the demurrer was overruled on appeal to this supreme court, the defendant in its  answer, among other allegations, set forth: that it admitted that the  plaintiff company was, at the time Of  the presentation of the complaint, the owner of the steamer <em>Nuestra Senora del Pilar,<\/em> entered in the marine registry of this city and licensed  to navigate in the waters of the Philippines, and admitted the allegations of paragraph 4, relative to the defendant's being the owner of the San Juan, of the  registry  of the port of Manila, but expressly denied all the other allegations contained in paragraph  3 of the complaint, which had reference to the steamer <em>Nuestra Senora  del Pilar <\/em> and to its cargo, and denied  each and  all of the allegations contained  in paragraphs 5 to 10, inclusive, of the said complaint.   The defendant, therefore, asked that, after  due trial, it be absolved from the complaint and the plaintiff  be sentenced to pay the costs.<\/p>\n<p>The case came to trial, and both parties presented the matter  in controversy under depositions taken by  common accord.   On April 12, 1911, the  trial court rendered judgment sentencing the defendant company, The Pasig  Steamer and Lighter Company, to  pay to the plaintiff company, G. Urrutia &amp; Co. the sum of P1,650,  together  with  interest thereon at the rate of  6 per cent  from the date of the presentation of the complaint, May 19, 1909, and to bear the costs of the trial.  To this judgment the plaintiff took exception and  by a written motion asked for the annulment of the judgment and the holding of a new trial, on the grounds that the said judgment was not supported by the evidence, that the conclusions deduced from the facts were openly and manifestly contrary to the proofs, and that the judgment was contrary to law.   This motion was overruled by an order of April 29, 1911, and exception thereto was taken by the plaintiff who duly presented the proper bill of exceptions  which was certified and forwarded to  the clerk of this court, accompanied by a transcript of all the evidence. This action is to recover compensation or remuneration for salvage services rendered by the steamer <em>Nuestra Senora del Pilar<\/em> to the <em>San Juan<\/em>, on an occasion when the latter was  in imminent danger from a cyclone then blowing and threatening it; a cable had become entangled in the propeller of the latter vessel thus making it impossible for it to move in obedience to its machinery and exposing it to the mercy of the storm that was raging, of the waves and of the currents between certain islands.<\/p>\n<p>There  being no express legislation exactly applicable to cases of salvage, nor legal principles thereto relating established by the  courts, pursuant to the second paragraph of article 6 of the  Civil  Code,  we must fall  back  upon the customs  of the place, and m the absence thereof, general principles of law.<\/p>\n<p>When  so important a  service is rendered as that of salving a vessel  with its crew and the cargo it carries, from a  positive danger to which it is exposed, strict justice demands that whoever  effects so meritorious a  service should receive adequate remuneration therefor,  not only on account of the act performed  in  behalf of  the shipowner and the crew, but also because of the danger run by the vessel which made the  salvage, due to the circumstances that existed at the time such service was  rendered. In a lease of work or services, says article 1544 of the Civil Code, one  of the  parties binds  himself to  execute a  work or to render a service to the other for a specified price.  In  accordance with the provisions  of this article, the  service rendered in the natural course of events and at an ordinary time must be remunerated, unless the service be rendered gratuitously at the express will of the server. So that, when the steamer <em>Nuestra Senora del Pilar<\/em>  responded to the call for help,  made  by means  of signals displayed by the captain of the steamer San Juan, in the midst of a violent storm, which signals conveyed the information that the latter vessel was unable to navigate for the reason indicated  and inquired  whether the  steamer signaled would tow it to a safe anchorage,  it is only just that the steamer <em>San Juan<\/em>, after having been saved from the danger and conducted within the bay,  called a shipyard, of the Island of Mindoro, should pay,  in recompense for such  valuable and extraordinary  service,  due and proper  remuneration to the owner  of  the  salving vessel, <em>Nuestra Senora del Pilar,<\/em> once it was satisfactorily proved that the San Juan could  not be guided by  its rudder,  or navigated  by the use of its engine,  on  account of a cable having  become wrapped and entangled  in its propeller, so that, as a consequence of the said storm, the steamer rolled heavily and was exposed to certain wreck or stranding upon the coasts of the adjacent islands.<\/p>\n<p>The second officer of the <em>San Juan<\/em>, in his sworn testimony, stated that this steamer, but for the aid received, would have been exposed to  real danger, and that, had it continued adrift, it might have been stranded,  as it was impossible to lower a boat for the purpose  of freeing the propeller from the cable entangled in it, owing to the bad weather and the heavy seas; an attempt was made to  do so, but no one dared to go down to perform  this  operation.<\/p>\n<p>The principle has been  established by the courts of the United States that when a vessel has been disabled by the breaking of its shaft  at sea and hoists  signals asking for aid, and another vessel goes to its relief and takes it  in tow, such service rendered is one of salvage, and not merely of towage.<\/p>\n<p>The towage of a vessel in peril to some place of security, when it is unable by itself to reach the same, is a service of salvage.<\/p>\n<p>The towage of a vessel  which has lost the use of its engine by accident, though it is complete in its hull and masts, is a service of salvage, and it is not necessary that the  said loss be inevitable since, in view of the peril, the vessel could not be salved in any other way:  for it is sufficient that at the moment the service was rendered there was a probable, threatening danger and a reasonable fear that it might strike.<\/p>\n<p>Hence it is not here a question of a simple service of towage in ordinary and normal weather, but of an extraordinary act of salvage performed in behalf of the steamer <em>San Juan<\/em>  in exceptional circumstances and while a cyclone was raging over the part of the sea where the salved vessel then was, which, in the midst of such peril, was unable to govern its movements through its engine on account of the inserviceability of its propeller.<\/p>\n<p>Compensation in such cases as that which occurred to the <em>San Juan<\/em>, deserves to be considered as a reward for the service rendered by the <em>Nuestra Senora del Pilar<\/em> in the midst of a peril to which the rescued as well as the salving steamer was exposed,  and it  is  proper  that such  reward should be  made, not only because of the salvage of the vessel and of the goods it  carried and the  rescue of its crew, but also in order that it may serve as  an incentive to render  prompt  and efficient  aid  in  such cases when requested by those who in the midst of such unfortunate circumstances are urgently in  need thereof.  It should also be borne in mind that  the <em>Nuestra  Senora del Pilar<\/em> is a merchant vessel and as such  should with more reason be favored for the service which  it rendered to the San Juan, which perhaps otherwise might have been lost with all its cargo and crew.<\/p>\n<p>The obligation to remunerate the service before referred to having been shown to be lawful and just, it only remains to fix the amount thereof.  Taking  account, then, of the value of the vessel salved and  of its cargo and the circumstances of the occasion, time and place when and where the service of salvage was performed, it appears just and equitable to fix the value thereof at P5,000, considering that while the amount specified in the judgment appealed from is exceedingly low, on the other hand, that demanded  by the appellant is, in the judgment of this court, excessive.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons,  it is our  opinion  that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed; provided, however, that the defendant,  The Pasig Steamer and Lighter Co., shall pay to the plaintiff,  G.  Urrutia &amp; Co., the sum of P5,000, with interest thereon at the rate of six per cent per annum from May 19, 1909, when the  complaint was filed,  until its complete payment, and shall also pay the costs of the case.<\/p>\n<p><em> Arellano, C.

The damages which plaintiff Alzua seeks to recover in this section are alleged to have resulted from the entry by this court of an alleged erroneous judgment in a former action to which Alzua was a party defendant. The error which it is alleged was committed by the court in entering that judgment, is attributed to the alleged false and misleading statement of the facts of the case which is set out in the written opinion upon which the judgment of the court was based. The complaint specifically charges the defendant, the writer of that opinion, with having willfully, maliciously, and in bad faith, perverted and misstated the facts set out therein for the purpose of deceiving the other members of the court to whom the opinion was submitted for signature; and it is further charged, that this was but one of a series of malicious and wrongful acts: whereby the defendant succeeded in deceiving his associates, and induced them to sign the order directing the entry of the alleged erroneous judgment. As a necessary corollary to the surmises, conjectures, and specific charges of wrongdoing set out in the complaint, if these surmises, conjectures, and specific charges are well founded, the four members of this court whose signatures are attached to that opinion together with that of the defendant, must have signed the opinion with no personal knowledge of the contents of the record submitted to them for adjudication, and without having read the briefs of counsel, relying wholly upon the alleged false and misleading statement of the facts prepared by the defendant as the basis for the judgment which it is alleged was erroneously entered by the court.<br\/><br\/>We need hardly say that in sitting in judgment upon a complaint which thus boldly attacks the good name and fame of one of our associates, and which indirectly reflects upon the credit and reputation of the whole court, we keenly recognize the delicacy of our position; and that had we any discretion so to do, we would decline to take part in the discussion and decision of the questions submitted on this appeal. But our duty, as members of the court of last resort in these Islands, demands that in this case, as in all other cases duly submitted to us for adjudication, we proceed, in the language of our solemn oath of office, to \"administer justice without respect to persons, and with equal right to the rich and the poor\" and that we \"faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon us, as members of this court, according to the best of our ability and understanding, agreeably to the laws of the Philippine Islands.\"<br\/><br\/>We are, however, in some sort relieved of the extreme embarrassment to which we might otherwise be subjected by the exceptional character of the allegations and charges set out in the complaint:<br\/><br\/>(1) By the knowledge that our action herein is subject to review by a higher court;<br\/><br\/>(2) By the fact that counsel, upon submitting the case on appeal, formally advised the court that it was submitted for judgment without any objection to the participation therein of any of the members of the court whose signatures are hereto attached; and<br\/><br\/>(3) Because the case is before us in such form that we can fully and completely dispose of all the issues involved, without being called upon to decide any difficult, doubtful or uncertain questions of fact; and because, without any doubts or misgivings as to the correctness of our conclusions, we are unanimously of opinion not only that the plaintiff has no legal right to maintain this action, even if the truth of all her charges of official misconduct and wrongdoing on the part of the defendant be admitted; but that an examination of the complaint, together with the exhibits incorporated therein, clearly discloses that even if plaintiff could be permitted to maintain this action, she has no just claim against the defendant; that she did not as alleged, suffer the damages complained of, or any damages whatever; that the material and relevant facts well pleaded in the complaint do not sustain or justify the surmises, conjectures, inferential allegations and specific charges of misconduct on the part of the defendant contained therein: that on the contrary the complaint, read together with the exhibits and court files which are incorporated therein, clearly discloses facts which justify us in holding that the defendant was not guilty of any misconduct or wrongdoing in connection with the entry of the judgment in question or the litigation in the course of which it was rendered; that his intervention in the adjudication of the causes mentioned in the complaint was had in the due and proper performance of his duty; that a failure or neglect on his part to do each and all of the acts complained of, substantially in manner and form as he did in fact do them, would have rendered him liable to a well-founded charge of dereliction in the performance of the duties of his office as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands; and, finally, that the two separate final judgments entered by this court in the causes referred to in the complaint, which are alleged to have been erroneously entered at the instigation of the defendant, were justly and lawfully entered, and adjudicated the issues involved in each of them \"according to the very right of the cause\" and \"agreeably to the laws of the Philippine Islands.\"<br\/><br\/>It is hardly possible that any one can be better informed than are we as to the truth in regard to the extended litigation in this court which culminated in the alleged erroneous judgment. Certainly no one can be in better position than are the members of this court to interpret correctly the various incidents of that litigation as they are disclosed by our own records. Nevertheless, this case having been submitted to us for a review of the action of the court below in sustaining a demurrer to the complaint, and that demurrer admitting, as it does, the truth of all the material and relevant facts which are well pleaded; we have taken scrupulous care to decide the appeal thus submitted, not upon any matter of our own knowledge which could not have been known to the court below, but strictly upon the facts disclosed by the complaint, aided only by those additional facts of which the court below might and should have taken judicial notice.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for Alzua, the real plaintiff and appellant in this action, and who will be referred to hereinafter as the plaintiff,contend that the judgment of the lower court sustaining the demurrer should be reversed because, as counsel contend, if the truth of the allegations contained in the complaint be admitted, it appears that she suffered damages, actual and special, amounting to some P65,000 as the result of the entry of an erroneous judgment against her for the sum of P12,000 by the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands in a certain action to which she was a party defendant, to satisfy which she was compelled, as she alleges, to sell certain valuable real estate at a great sacrifice; and because, as counsel contend, this erroneous judgment was rendered by the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands as a result of the unlawful and malicious intervention of the defendant in the various proceedings had in this court leading up to its entry. The alleged unlawful acts cf the defendant to which the complaint directs the attention of the court consist of an alleged misstatement and perversion of the facts developed by the record which is set out in his written opinion in the case wherein the alleged erroneous judgment was entered, and a like misstatement of the facts developed in the record which is set out in his written opinion in a prior case intimately connected therewith; also the striking out with pen and ink by the defendant of the word \"affirmed\" and the substitution therefor of the word \"revoked\" in the original order directing entry of judgment in the earlier case, and the issuance by him, at the same time, of directions to the clerk of the court to suspend the execution of the order thus amended, until the further order of the court. The complaint charges that the intervention by the defendant in these proceedings was actuated throughout by an intent to injure the plaintiff in this action; that the statement of facts set out in the opinions written by him, upon which the judgments in those cases were entered, were false, and made by the defendant knowing them to be false; that the amendment made to the order directing the entry of judgment in the first cause by striking out the word \"affirmed\" and substituting therefore the word \"revoked,\" was made by the defendant surreptitiously, unlawfully, without consulting with his associates, and with intent to injure the plaintiff in this action; that it constituted a willful and deliberate falsification of the records of this court by the defendant in this action; and that the defendant, by thus unlawfully and maliciously intervening in the proceedings of the court upon the appeals in the two above-mentioned causes, procured the entry of the erroneous judgment from which sprung the damages complained of by plaintiff in this action. Counsel contend that the truth of these allegations being admitted by the demurrer, judgment should be rendered against the defendant for damages: P40,000 as actual damages, that being the alleged value of the real estate which plaintiff Alzua was compelled to sell in order to satisfy the alleged erroneous judgment against her for P12,000; P25,000 by way of special damages because of the loss of profits from this property of which she was thus deprived from the date of its sale to the date of the institution of this action; and P50,000 by way of punitive damages, which plaintiff claims, apparently on the ground of the malicious character of the alleged wrong done her by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>We do not think that these contentions of counsel for appellant are supported by the facts well pleaded in the complaint; and, on the contrary, we are unanimously of opinion, and so hold, that the demurrer to the complaint was properly sustained by the court below. Our conclusions are based on several grounds, each of which is sufficient in itself to sustain the action of the trial judge. We shall, therefore, set out the various grounds on which our judgment rests very summarily in the first place; and, thereafter, we shall examine each of them in greater detail and under separate heads.<br\/><br\/>First. We hold that, admitting the truth of all the allegations set out in the complaint, and of all the surmises, conjectures, inferential allegations, and specific charges of official misconduct and wrongdoing, and of malice, bad faith, and intent to injure the plaintiff contained therein, the defendant, nevertheless, is not liable to respond in a civil action for the damages which it is alleged were occasioned thereby.<br\/><br\/>Second. We hold that the complaint itself, read together with the exhibits and court records which are incorporated therein, clearly discloses that the judgment, out of which plaintiff claims that the alleged damages sprung, was not erroneously entered as alleged in the complaint, and therefore that the plaintiff has no claim for damages against the defendant; in other words, that the facts set out in the complaint do not constitute a cause of action.<br\/><br\/>Third. We hold that the complaint itself, read together with the exhibits and court records which are incorporated therein, sets forth facts which clearly demonstrate that the surmises, conjectures, inferential allegations, and specific charges of official misconduct and wrongdoing directed against the defendant in the complaint are not well founded. We hold also, in this connection, that the allegations in the complaint of malice, bad faith, and intent on the part of the defendant to injure the plaintiff are not sustained, and on the contrary are directly controverted, by the specific averments of facts set out in the complaint when read together with the court records specifically referred to therein. We conclude, therefore, that proof of the material and relevant facts well pleaded in the complaint would not sustain the charges of bad faith, malice, and wicked intent set out therein, which on plaintiff's own theory of the case must be shown to exist before she can establish a cause of action; or in other words, that the facts set out in the complaint do not constitute a cause of action.<br\/><br\/><center>I.<br\/><\/center> <br\/>In support of the proposition that defendant is not liable to respond in a civil action for the damages alleged in the complaint, we might, perhaps, rely upon the reasoning of the concurring opinion in the case of Forbes vs. Chuoco Tiaco (16 Phil. Rep., 534), wherein the writer undertakes to establish that \"whenever and wherever a judge of a court of superior jurisdiction exercises judicial functions, he will not be personally liable in civil damages for the result of his actions,\" and that \"the test of judicial liability is not jurisdiction, but such liability depends wholly upon the nature of the question which is being determined when the error complained of is committed by the court. If such question is one the determination of which requires the exercise of judicial functions, the judge is not liable, even though there is in reality an absolute failure of jurisdiction over the subject matter.\" Applying this test to the allegations contained in the complaint, there could be no question as to the nonliability of the defendant to respond in this action for the alleged damages. We shall not, however, rest our decision in this case upon the doctrine thus enunciated, nor shall we in any wise rely upon the reasoning or the conclusions contained in the concurring opinion in the Forbes case. The doctrine as to nonliability of judges therein set forth has not been uniformly and unquestioningly accepted by all the courts which have been called upon to consider the principles involved; and indeed, the writer of that opinion carefully directs attention to the fact that the doctrine as to nonliability of judges therein announced is, if not a step in advance of the doctrine generally recognized in English and American courts, at least a statement of the doctrine in a form which has not yet received universal judicial recognition and acceptance. We prefer, therefore, since the facts in this case permit us to do so, to rest our conclusions upon a much narrower and more restricted proposition touching the liability of judicial officers, which has never been seriously questioned by any court of last resort in England or the United States; merely observing in passing, that the rule of judicial liability on which we propose to rely is not in conflict with the doctrine laid down in the concurring opinion in the Forbes case, but is included therein, so that the grounds of public policy on which the broader doctrine rests necessarily sustain the more restricted statement of the rule upon which we propose to rely.<br\/><br\/>We hold that under the law as it now exists in these Islands judges of superior and general jurisdiction are not liable to respond in civil action for damages for what they may do in the exercise of their judicial functions when acting within their legal powers and jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>The grounds of public policy upon which this proposition rests have been held by the very highest authority to protect judges, even when acting in excess of jurisdiction; and with much reason many authorities have held that upon the same grounds of public policy the protecting mantle of this rule should be thrown around judges of inferior jurisdiction as well as those of superior jurisdiction. So the writer of the concurring opinion in the Forbes case, supra, in carrying the reasoning on which this rule rests to what he conceives to be its logical conclusion, lays down the still broader rule above cited. But for the purposes of this decision we desire to limit ourselves to the restricted statement of the rule as just laid down, because as we believe and will undertake hereinafter to establish, there can be no question that whatever may have been the motives of the defendant, the allegations of the complaint disclose that in doing each and all of the acts complained of, he was acting \"as a judge,\" in the exercise of his judicial functions, and that in doing these acts he was clearly and undoubtedly acting within his legal powers and jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>This restricted statement of the rule of judicial liability in civil actions is universally asserted by the text-writers, and is a settled principle of law as applied by the courts of England and the United States. It needs no citation of authorities to sustain it, and we shall not burden the body of this opinion with the arguments which are advanced in its support. But in the margin (Notes C and D, pp. 334, 336) will be found a full statement of the grounds of public policy on which it rests, quoted from Mr. Cooley's work on Torts; and an extensive citation from the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States written by Chief Justice Field in the case of Bradley vs. Fisher,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> in which the rule is discussed at length.<br\/><br\/>There can be no need of argument to demonstrate that the defendant, an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, was acting within the limits of his legal powers and jurisdiction in taking part in the adjudication of the appeals in the two cases referred to in the complaint; in discussing the issues involved therein with his associates; in preparing the written opinions therein and submitting them to the other members of the court for signature; and in joining with them in the issuance of the necessary orders for the entry of the final judgments rendered by the court. The only question, therefore, as to the legal powers and jurisdiction of the defendant to do the various acts mentioned in the complaint which need be considered, arises in connection with his action in amending the order directing the entry of judgment in the earlier case referred to in the complaint, and in giving directions to the clerk of the court not to execute the original order nor the order as amended until the further order of the court, We hold that if it be admitted that the court itself had legal powers and jurisdiction thus to amend its own order and to suspend the execution thereof until the further order of the court, then the facts alleged in the complaint conclusively establish the legal powers and jurisdiction of the defendant so to do. The complaint expressly alleges that all of these acts were done during the judicial vacation of the court in the year 1907: and furthermore, it sets forth facts which fully sustain the averment contained therein that these acts were done on or about the 8th day of April, 1907. But at that time the defendant was acting as vacation justice, designated to remain on duty during the vacation period of the year 1907, with full legal powers and jurisdiction to do each and all of these acts if the court itself would have had such powers and jurisdiction to do them when in regular session. True the complaint studiously refrains from mentioning the fact that at the time when these acts were done the defendant was on duty as vacation justice of the court, but we hold that this court as well as the court below may and should take judicial notice of that fact, under the provisions of section 421 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and an extract from the official copy of the administrative order designating him for that duty, which was furnished to all the courts of the Islands, will be found in marginal note B.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup><br\/><br\/>That the court itself had plenary control over the order in question, and complete legal powers and jurisdiction to amend it, and to issue orders to the clerk directing suspension of its execution until further orders, will be shown further on in this opinion; and indeed this proposition is so apparent that it is hardly necessary to set forth the reasoning on which it rests. That the defendant, as vacation justice of the court, had full legal powers and jurisdiction to do likewise, becomes very clear from a reading of the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of section 5 of Act No. 136 as amended by section 1 of Act No. 867, set out in marginal note E,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[2]<\/sup> which confer and define the legal powers and jurisdiction of Justices of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands designated for duty during judicial vacations. Under the rulings and practice of this court in construing these provisions of the law, it cannot be doubted that the interlocutory jurisdiction thus conferred by law upon vacation justices of this court clothed the defendant with full legal powers and jurisdiction to make the provisional amendment of the order directing the entry of the judgment, and to direct the suspension of its execution until the further orders of the court, these acts being essentially interlocutory in their nature, and, in the very language of the statute, \"not final in their character\" and not involving \"a decision of the case pending on the merits.\"<br\/><br\/>The allegations of the complaint setting forth that all the acts complained of therein, were done by the defendant, in the exercise of his judicial functions, as a justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, a court of superior and general jurisdiction; and it clearly appearing from the complaint, that in doing each and all of the acts complained of, he was acting within the limits of his legal powers and jurisdiction; it follows, as of course, that he cannot be held to respond in this action for the damages which it is alleged were occasioned thereby, since \"judges of superior and general jurisdiction are not liable to respond in civil actions for damages for what they may do in the exercise of their judicial functions when acting within their legal powers and jurisdiction.\"<br\/><br\/>But counsel for appellants, while they do not deny that the rule of law on which we rely is. universally recognized and applied in the courts of England and the United States, insist that it is not a correct statement of the law in force in these Islands. As we understand their contention, it is that this rule is a rule of the common law of England, and as such not in force in the Philippines; and that the doctrine as to the liability of judicial officers in civil actions is to be derived from the Spanish substantive law in force in these Islands at the time of their transfer to American sovereignty, modified only by the provisions of section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>To this we answer that while it is true that the body of the common law as known to Anglo-American jurisprudence is not in force in these Islands, \"nor are the doctrines derived therefrom binding upon our courts, save only in so far as they are founded on sound principles applicable to local conditions, and are not in conflict with existing law\" (U. S. vs. Cuna, 12 Phil. Rep., 241); nevertheless many of the rules, principles, and doctrines of the common law have, to all intents and purposes, been imported into this jurisdiction, as a result of the enactment of new laws and the organization and establishment of new institutions by the Congress of the United States or under its authority; for it will be found that many of these laws can only be construed and applied with the aid of the common law from which they are derived, and that to breathe the breath of life into many of the institutions introduced in these Islands under American sovereignty recourse must be had to the rules, principles, and doctrines of the common law under whose protecting the prototypes of these institutions had their birth.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Kepner vs. United States (195 U. S., 100; 11 Phil. Rep., 669), the Supreme Court of the United States declared that;<br\/><blockquote>\"The expressed declarations of the President in Military Order, No. 58, of April 23, 1900, and in the Act of July 1, 1902, establishing a civil government in the Philippine Islands, both adopting with little alteration the provisions of the Bill of Rights, show that it was intended to carry to the Philippine Islands those principles of our Government which the President declared to be established as rules of law for the maintenance of individual freedom; and those expressions were used in the sense which has been placed upon them in construing the instrument from which they were taken.<br\/><br\/>\"It is a well-settled rule of construction that language used in a statute which has a settled and well-known meaning, sanctioned by judicial decision, is presumed to be used in that sense by the legislative body.<br\/><br\/>\"It is a well-settled principle of construction that specific terms covering the given subject matter will prevail over general language of the same or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling.<br\/><br\/>\"In ascertaining the meaning of a phrase in the Constitution taken from the Bill of Rights, it must be construed with reference to the common law from which it was taken.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>So in Serra vs. Mortiga (204 U. S., 470; 11 Phil. Rep., 762) the same court held that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The guaranties extended by Congress to the Philippine Islands are to be interpreted as meaning what the like provisions meant when Congress made them applicable to those Islands.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>And it is safe to say that in every volume of the Philippine Reports, numbers of cases might be cited wherein recourse has been had to the rules, principles, and doctrines of the common law in ascertaining the true meaning and scope of the legislation enacted in and for the Philippine Islands since they passed under American sovereignty.<br\/><br\/>Among the earliest measures of the Philippine Commission, after the establishment of Civil Government under American sovereignty, was the enactment on June 11, 1901, of Act No. 136, \"An Act providing for the organization of courts in the Philippine Islands.\" This Act in express terms abolished the then existing <i>Audiencia<\/i> or Supreme Court and Courts of First Instance, and substituted in their place the courts provided therein. It sets out in general terms the jurisdiction, duties, privileges, and powers of the new courts and their judges. The majority of the members of the body which enacted it were able American lawyers. The spirit with which it is informed, and indeed its very language and terminology would be unintelligible without some knowledge of the judicial systems of England and the United States. Its manifest purpose and object was to replace the old judicial system, with its incidents and traditions drawn from Spanish sources, with a new system modeled in all its essential characteristics upon the judicial systems of the United States. It cannot be doubted, therefore, that any incident of the former system which conflicts with the essential principles and settled doctrines on which the new system rests, must be held to be abrogated by the law organizing the new system.<br\/><br\/>The exemption of judges of courts of superior or general authority from liability in a civil action for acts done by them in the exercise of their judicial functions is a principle essentially inherent in the various judicial systems upon which the system organized under Act No. 136 is modeled. The grounds of public policy and the reasoning upon which the doctrine is based are not less forceful and imperative in these Islands than in the countries from which the new judicial system was borrowed; and an examination of the reasons assigned by the Supreme Court of the United States and by Mr. Cooley in his work on Torts for the universal recognition of the rule in the United States, as set out in the margin (Notes C and D<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>) leaves no room for doubt that a failure to recognize it as an incident to the new judicial system would materially impair its usefulness, and tend very strongly to defeat the ends for which it was established. Indeed, upon the authority of the reasoning in the case of Bradley vs. Fisher, it may safely be asserted that an attempt to enforce any rule of law in conflict with this doctrine would be utterly subversive of the system of jurisprudence established in these Islands under and by virtue of the authority of the Congress of the United States:<br\/><blockquote>\"For it is a general principle of the highest importance to the proper administration of justice that a judicial officer, in exercising the authority vested in him, shall be free to act upon his own convictions, without apprehension of personal consequences to himself. Liability to answer to everyone who might feel himself aggrieved by the action of the judge would be inconsistent with the possession of this freedom, and would destroy that independence without which no judiciary can be either respectable or useful. As observed by a distinguished English judge, it would establish the weakness of judicial authority in a degrading responsibility.<br\/><br\/>\"The principle, therefore, which exempts judges of courts of superior or general authority from liability in a civil action for acts done by them in the exercise of their judicial functions, obtains in all countries where there is any well-ordered system of jurisprudence. It has been the settled doctrine of the English courts for many centuries, and has never been denied, that we are aware of, in the courts of this country.\" (Bradley vs. Fisher, <i>supra<\/i>.)<br\/><\/blockquote>We conclude, that if it be true, as asserted by counsel for appellant, that the provisions of Spanish law in force in these Islands prior to American occupation are in conflict with the doctrine of nonliability of judges above set out, such provisions of the old law must be held to have been abrogated by the enactment of Act No. 136 of the Philippine Commission, to at least the extent with which they are in conflict with that doctrine.<br\/><br\/>But while we hold that since the enactment of Act No. 136 the doctrine as to the liability of judges must be laid down in accordance with principles derived from Anglo-American rather than Spanish jurisprudence, and that it is not dependent for its existence upon Spanish legislation, we do not admit that there is, in truth, any substantial conflict between the two systems in this regard. We would, indeed, be surprised to find that the learned Spanish authors of the scientific and carefully wrought codes of Spain had disregarded a principle which the Supreme Court of the United States declares \"obtains in all countries where there is any well-ordered system of jurisprudence.\" (Bradley vs. Fisher, <i>supra<\/i>.) It may be interesting, therefore, and perhaps profitable to glance for a moment at the provisions of Spanish law upon this subject.<br\/><br\/>It will be seen from the citations set out in marginal note F<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> that the liability (<i>responsabilidad<\/i>) of Spanish judicial officers was limited to the indemnification (<i>resarcimiento<\/i>) of damages to private persons when in the exercise of their functions they violated the laws through negligence or inexcusable ignorance; and it was further expressly provided that such negligence or ignorance is to be deemed inexcusable when it appears that those officers have pronounced a ruling or judgment manifestly contrary to the law, or when they have failed to take some step or to comply with some formality which the law expressly prescribes, upon such conditions that the failure so to do invalidates the proceeding.<br\/><br\/>Here we have two separate grounds of liability, neither of them in any wise dependent on the motive or intent of the judge, so that in Spanish as in American jurisprudence the existence and character of the motive or intent behind the commission of the act complained of can have no place in the inquiry as to the civil liability of a judge of superior and general authority when acting within his jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>One of the grounds of liability set out in the Spanish law, that is to say, manifest and inexcusable negligence in failing to take some step or to comply with some formality which the law expressly prescribes, is evidently limited to cases involving a failure on the part of the judge to perform some ministerial function prescribed by law, as to which he has no judicial discretion. And certainly this provision as to the liability of judicial officers is not in conflict with Anglo-American jurisprudence in this regard; for in England and the United States the liability of judicial officers for acts done in the performance of such ministerial functions as may be imposed upon them is generally recognized and sustained; the rule in this regard as laid down in 23 Cyc, 571, and many cases there cited being that:<br\/><blockquote>\"For the wrongful execution of or refusal to perform a ministerial duty or authority annexed to a judicial office, the officer is answerable to the injured party in an action at law, whether or not he acts in good faith; or personally, or by a clerk whom he has authorized to perform the acts; and his judicial character affords him no protection.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The only other ground of civil liability of judicial officers under the Spanish law springs from inexcusable negligence or ignorance in pronouncing a ruling or judgment <i>manifestly<\/i> contrary to the law. But critically examined this provision appears to be substantially identical with the rule as to the liability of judicial officers, derived by the writer of the concurring opinion in the Forbes case (<i>supra<\/i>) from a careful review of the principles laid down by Anglo-American authorities\u2014a rule which, as we have said, is much broader than the rule relied upon by us, and in which the narrower and more restricted rule is necessarily included. To say that a judge is only liable when he is guilty of inexcusable ignorance or negligence, and that ignorance or negligence will be deemed inexcusable only when a ruling or judgment <i>manifestly<\/i> contrary to the law is pronounced by the judge, is substantially equivalent to a declaration that the judge can only be held liable when it appears that the acts complained of were not done by him in the exercise of judicial discretion, were not done by him as a judge, were not the result of the exercise of judicial functions; because, in any case wherein the acts complained of appear to have been manifestly contrary to the law, no real question can have been submitted for decision; that is to say, no question whose determination required the exercise of judicial functions. In truth this branch of the rule of liability of judges as laid down in the Spanish law hardly admits of differentiation from the rule of liability as laid down in the concurring opinion in the Forbes case. But we shall not pursue this inquiry further, and content ourselves with setting out the rule as laid down in the syllabus of that opinion merely for purposes of convenient comparison.<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>The rule of liability<\/i>.\u2014The rule of liability is: If the question is one which a judge, qualified in the average way for the position occupied by the offending judge or for a similar judicial position, would regard as a real question, then it is one whose determination requires the exercise of judicial functions. But if it is one so clear that a judge, qualified as aforesaid, would not regard as a real question, then it is one whose determination does not require the exercise of judicial functions. In the former case, the judge is not liable; in the latter, he is.\" (Forbes vs. Chouco Tiaco, 16 Phil. Rep., 534.)<br\/><\/blockquote>We venture to assert, therefore, that the rule of liability of judicial officers, as laid down in the old Spanish law, is not in substantial conflict with that recognized by the American authorities upon which we rely. Both judicial systems recognize the liability of these officers for wrongs committed in the performance of purely ministerial functions; and the Spanish rule that liability is not .incurred unless the act done is so manifestly contrary to the law as to negative the possibility that it was done in the <i>exercise of judicial functions<\/i>, though a broader rule than the rule on which we rely, that is to say that \"judges of courts of superior and general jurisdiction are not liable for acts done in the exercise of their judicial functions and within their legal power and jurisdiction,\" is manifestly not in conflict therewith.<br\/><br\/>But counsel insist that the true rule as to the civil liability of judicial officers in these Islands is to be found in section 9 of Act No. 190, the only legislative enactment under American sovereignty which, expressly, and in terms, treats of the \"civil liability of judges.\" This section is one of the \"general and preliminary provisions\" of the Code of Civil Procedure, and is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Civil liability of judges<\/i>.\u2014No judge, justice of the peace, or assessor shall be liable to a civil action for the recovery of damages by reason of any judicial action or judgment rendered by him in good faith, and within the limits of his legal powers and jurisdiction.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Counsel contend that under the provisions of this section all judicial officers may be held liable in civil actions for damages resulting from their erroneous or wrongful acts as judges, unless it appears that the acts complained of were done by them; first, in good faith; and second, within the limits of their legal powers and jurisdiction. The contention seems to be that by expressly exempting judges from liability in certain cases, this section prescribes, by necessary implication, that they shall be liable in all other cases. We do not think that this contention can be maintained.<br\/><br\/>In the first place it fails to take into account the state of the law in force at the time when the Code of Civil Procedure was enacted. We think we have shown that after the enactment of Act No. 136 the rule of law, at least as to judges of superior and general jurisdiction, was that they were not liable to civil actions for damages when acting within their legal powers and jurisdiction. Doubtless the immunity will be held to extend to judges acting \"in excess of their jurisdiction;\" and it may be found that it should be extended so as to protect judicial officers of every kind to the full limits of the rule laid down in the concurring opinion in the Forbes case and the Spanish laws above cited. But beyond any question, the rule in its more restricted and limited form was in force in these Islands at the time when section 9 of Act No. 190 was promulgated. There is no necessary conflict between the provisions of this section and the rule as above enunciated, and they should not therefore be held to repeal or to abrogate the rule by necessary implication.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup><br\/><br\/>It will be observed that the provisions of section 9 merely negative the existence of civil liability in certain cases. The section does not undertake to define the nature of the civil liability of judicial officers generally. It contains no affirmative provisions whatever imposing liability upon these officials. Yet it is contended that it not only abrogated the existing law touching the liability of judicial officers but inferentially prescribed the rule of liability in all cases; and this rule thus inferentially prescribed, one which is in conflict with the rule that, in the language of the Supreme Court of the United States, \"obtains in all countries where there is any well ordered system of jurisprudence.\"<br\/><br\/>If such had been the intention of the legislator we are convinced that he would have used language which would not admit of doubt as to its meaning. If the intent of the statute was to provide that judicial officers would be liable in all other cases than those mentioned therein, such an extraordinary provision would have been set forth in express terms and not left to mere inference. Certainly, in the absence of clear and express language we should not and will not read into the section of a general law of procedure a provision which the Supreme Court of the United States has declared would be subversive of the whole procedural system of which it forms a part. Indeed we venture to go further, and assert that even if the language were not doubtful, and if the provisions of this minor section of the general Code of Procedure expressly prescribed the rule of liability contended for by counsel for the appellants, it might well become our duty to declare it in conflict with the spirit and intent of the remaining provisions of the code, and to decline to enforce it. This, in order to conserve to the people of these Islands a free and independent judiciary, capable of securing to them those sacred rights guaranteed under the Philippine Bill of Rights, and strong enough to administer justice \"without respect to persons\" and to \"faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon it.\" For, quoting once again from the decision in Bradley vs. Fisher:<br\/><blockquote>\"Liability to answer to everyone who might feel himself aggrieved by the action of the judge would be inconsistent with the possession of this freedom, and would destroy that independence without which no judiciary can be either respectable or useful.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We hold that this \"general and preliminary\" provision of the Code of Civil Procedure is merely declaratory of the law as it existed prior to its enactment, and that it does not undertake to dispose of the whole subject of the liability of judicial officers. Its purpose and object is merely to set forth a general rule, applicable to all judicial officers alike, and under all circumstances. Unlike most of the provisions of that code, it is not, so far as we have been able to learn, borrowed from or modeled upon any similar provisions in the statutes of any of the States. Counsel for both appellant and appellee account for its presence in the code by reference to certain administrative proceedings had about the time of its enactment, involving the removal from office of a judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila for misconduct in office; and to the uncertainty, which it is said existed at that time, as to the precise meaning of the provisions of Spanish law touching the liabilty of judicial officers to respond in civil actions and administrative proceedings for acts done in the exercise of their judicial functions. But however this may be, it is quite clear that the legislator sought, in section 9 of the code, to lay down a general rule as to the civil liability of all judicial officers, whether of general or limited, or of superior or inferior authority, which would secure to all such officers the protection furnished by a rule of liability, universally recognized in Anglo-American jurisprudence; and that he made no attempt to enter upon an exhaustive definition and exposition of the precise extent and limitation of the civil responsibility of the various classes of judicial officers for acts done by them in the exercise of their judicial functions.<br\/><br\/>An examination of American and English authorities discloses that there is much conflict of opinion as to whether the rule of civil liability upon which we rely in this opinion is applicable to judicial officers of inferior and limited jurisdiction as well as to those of superior and general authority; and it will be found that the various courts of last resort in the United States are by no means in agreement as to the degree of responsibility of these various classes of judicial officers for acts done in excess of their legal powers and jurisdiction. Indeed the dissenting opinion in the case of Bradley vs. Fisher, frequently cited in this opinion, discloses that while the authorities are all agreed upon the rule of liability relied upon by us as to judges of superior and general authority acting within their jurisdiction, differences have arisen as to the liability of such officers when, acting in excess of their jurisdiction, they are alleged to have been actuated by malicious and corrupt motives. In the resultant uncertainty as to the true rule of liability of judicial officers generally in the United States, it is easy to understand why the Philippine Commission in laying down \"general and preliminary provisions\" in the new Code of Civil Procedure did not attempt to harmonize all these conflicting views, nor to define the precise limitations of the civil liability of the various classes of judicial officers under all the varying circumstances which might present themselves.<br\/><br\/>While the doubts which arose as to the provisions of Spanish law on this subject might well have induced the American legislator to enact express provisions setting forth the rule universally recognized in the United States as to the limitations on the civil liability of judicial officers generally, it is clear that it was not deemed prudent or expedient in the \"general and preliminary provisions\" of the Code of Civil Procedure to go further and repeal existing law more specifically defining and limiting this liability in particular cases, or to undertake affirmatively to declare the nature and extent of the civil liability of judicial officers in all cases. This is precisely what we hold that a reading of the section itself discloses to have been the intention of the Commission in enacting it; and we are satisfied that the deductions drawn from it by the counsel for appellant are not justified by its terms, nor by a consideration of the conditions under which it was enacted and the mischief which it sought to remedy, and that the construction which counsel for appellant seeks to place upon it is contrary to those principles of public policy which ought to have controlled and doubtless did control the legislator in its enactment.<br\/><br\/>Perhaps we should not conclude this discussion of the doctrine of immunity of judicial officers from civil liability in certain cases without expressly directing attention to the fact that nothing therein is to be understood as giving to them the power to act with partiality, or maliciously, or corruptly, or arbitrarily, or oppressively without fear that they may be called to account for such conduct. No judge, however high his rank may be, is above or beyond the law which it is his high office to administer. Indeed, we would deem it our duty to be the first to take the necessary preliminary steps looking to the suspension and removal from office of the defendant, by impeachment or otherwise, if we were of opinion that the charges of misconduct in office preferred against him had any foundation in fact; and we would not allow the sun to set upon this day's session of the court without having issued the necessary orders for the institution of criminal proceedings against him if we had reason to believe that there are any grounds for the criminal charges set forth in the complaint.<br\/><br\/><center>II.<br\/><\/center> <br\/>Our holding that the defendant is not liable to respond in a civil action for the alleged damages completely and sufficiently disposes of this appeal, and we might rest our judgment sustaining the judgment of the court below on that ground alone. Indeed, having arrived at our conclusion in this regard we would ordinarily proceed to enter judgment without further discussion of the various contentions of counsel. In view, however, of the exceptional nature of the allegations of the complaint, and especially in view of the gravity of the charges against the defendant therein specifically set forth, we deem it proper to examine in some detail the other grounds above stated, upon each of which, as we have said, the judgment of the court below may be and should be sustained; each of them, in our opinion, being sufficient in itself for that purpose.<br\/><br\/>The second ground on which we base our judgment is that the complaint does not set out facts which constitute a cause of action, because, as we hold, a critical examination of the complaint and of the exhibits annexed thereto, together with the records of the cases specifically referred to therein, clearly demonstrates that the two judgments of this court out of which the alleged damages are said to have sprung were not erroneous as alleged in the complaint; and, on the contrary, that each of these causes was adjudicated \"in accordance with the very right of the cause\" and \"agreeably to the law in the Philippine Islands.\"<br\/><br\/>Before entering on an examination of the complaint for this purpose, it will be well to refer briefly to certain elementary rules of pleading, as to which we believe there can be no cavil under the system of procedure in civil cases borrowed from Anglo-American jurisprudence and introduced in these Islands under the new Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>While it is sometimes loosely stated that a demurrer admits the truth of all the allegations of fact set out in the complaint, the rule thus broadly stated has many important and well-recognized limitations and restrictions. A more accurate statement of the rule is that a demurrer admits the truth of all <i>material and relevant<\/i> facts <i>which are well pleaded<\/i>. It will readily be seen that the italicized portion of the rule as thus stated modifies the looser and broader statement of the rule to a marked degree. Without stopping to discuss the reasons for the various rules of pleading set out in the following paragraph, we lay them down here, relying upon the reasoning and authority of the cases cited in support of each and all of them.<br\/><br\/>A demurrer admits only such matters of fact as are sufficiently pleaded (Com. Dig. Pleader (A 5) ; 4 la., 63; 14 Ga., 8; 9 Barb., 297; 7 Ark., 282; 6 Wash., 315; 7 Misc. Rep., 1) ; a demurrer does not admit the truth of mere epithets charging fraud; nor allegations of legal conclusions (144 U. S., 75) ; nor an erroneous statement of law (97 Ala., 491). The admission of the truth of material and relevant facts well pleaded does not extend to render a demurrer an admission of inferences or conclusions drawn therefrom, even if alleged in the pleading; nor mere inferences or conclusions from facts not stated; nor conclusions of law; nor matters of evidence; nor surplusage and irrelevant matter. Furthermore, it is settled that the general rule touching admissions by demurrer does not apply <i>where the court may take judicial notice that the facts alleged are not true<\/i>; nor does it apply to legally impossible facts; <i>nor to facts which appear unfounded by a record incorporated in the pleading, or by a document referred to; nor to general averments contradicted by more specific averments<\/i>. So, also, the truth of scandalous matter, inserted merely to insult the opposing party, is not admitted. (In support of these propositions see many scores of cases cited in 31 Cyc, 333, 334, 335, 336, and 337, and 6 Enc. PI. &amp; Pr., 334, 335, 336, 337, and 338.)<br\/><br\/>It has been deemed proper to set out these general propositions laid down by the courts of last resort in the United States touching the limitations on the general rule as to admissions by demurrer, because, in this jurisdiction, wherein a new system of procedure has been but lately introduced, the cases thus far decided have not very exhaustively considered the limitations on the rule; and for a clear understanding of this portion of our opinion, it is necessary that these limitations should be kept clearly in mind. But it is proper here to observe that most of these propositions are themselves subject to certain restrictions and limitations in accordance with the varying nature of the infinite variety of conditions to which they are applicable.<br\/><br\/>It will be well, also, before entering upon a discussion of the allegations of the complaint, to refer very briefly to the rules of pleading touching the incorporation into complaints of exhibits and bills of particulars which the pleader desires to be shown for some purpose to the court or his adversary. The general rules on this subject are not wholly uniform; in various jurisdictions these rules have been greatly modified by statute; and many difficult and doubtful questions may, and doubtless will, present themselves in the course of practice in this jurisdiction, in deciding the precise conditions under which the pleader himself will be permitted to rely upon such exhibits and bills of particulars in aid of the complaint filed by him; and in deciding whether the references in his complaint to such instruments and writings should be deemed sufficient to incorporate them into his complaint so as to make them an\" integral part thereof.<br\/><br\/>But we think that there can be no doubt that where the pleader voluntarily and for his own convenience refers to certain instruments or writings in terms which leave no room for doubt as to their identity, and where the instruments or writings thus referred to are a part of the court files or records, he will rarely have just ground for complaint if, in such a case, these instruments or writings are held to be incorporated into his complaint, and to constitute a part thereof, so as to permit his adversary to refer to them in argument on demurrer. Indeed, \"where no confusion can result, the practice of incorporating portions of the court files as a part of a pleading, by a proper reference, has in some cases been approved as tending to abbreviate the record,\" and this in favor of the pleader. (Sutherland vs. Sutherland, 102 Iowa, 535; Wishard vs. McNeil, 78 Iowa, 40.) In Cancino vs. Valdez (3 Phil. Rep., 42.9) this court held as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"The original complaint having been held bad on demurrer, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, in which they referred to Exhibit A for a description of the land in litigation. Exhibit A was not attached to the amended complaint, but to the original complaint: <i>Held<\/i>, That under a liberal construction of the pleadings (authorized by section 106 of the Code of Civil Procedure) the amended complaint should be considered as though Exhibit A had been physically attached to it.\"<br\/><br\/>It is hardly necessary to add that, of course, where any doubt arises as to the meaning and scope of the language used in referring to such instruments and writings, the general rule applies, that \"the pleading will be construed against the pleader.\" (39 Cent. Dig. tit. Pleading, par. 66.)<br\/><br\/>It has been suggested that for the purpose of determining whether the facts alleged in the complaint in the case at bar constitute a cause of action, the court below might have taken judicial notice of the contents of the records of the various causes on file therein, and this whether the complaint itself made express reference to them or not. We do not deem it necessary to examine or decide, this contention. The complaint sets forth a series of averments of judicial error, of willful misrepresentation of facts, and a number of specific acts done in bad faith, which, it is alleged, are disclosed by a mere inspection of the records of two separate appealed cases on file in this court and the court below. The complaint expressly refers to these cases by title and register number, and incorporates extended extracts from the records of these cases as exhibits annexed to the complaint. We hold that the court below was fairly entitled to examine the records of these cases in ruling on the demurrer to the complaint, and that they had been sufficiently incorporated into the complaint for that purpose by the pleader himself.<br\/><br\/>As will be seen from the copy of the complaint set out in marginal note A, the pleader expressly and in detail refers to and definitely describes two separate cases, Nos. 4017 and 5719, filed in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila; gives what purports to be a relation of the proceedings had in those cases and the various steps taken therein in that court and in this court on appeal; and bases his cause of action in large part on his allegations that the relation of facts contained in the separate opinions filed in those cases, which were written by defendant, is not in accord with and perverts and misstates the facts disclosed by the records of those cases. He further alleges in the twentieth paragraph of the complaint as the very basis and foundation of his claim for relief, \"That defendant performed each and every act hereinbefore alleged in relation to causes Nos. 4017 and 5719 wrongfully and with intent to injure the plaintiff Alzua, and with full knowledge of the facts herein set forth. Plaintiffs further allege that such knowledge appears from an inspection of the decisions in causes Nos. 4017 and 5719.\" It is very clear that he can not complain if the court inspects those decisions, together with the record of the cases of which they are made a part, to ascertain whether these charges are or are not well founded.<br\/><br\/>The records of these cases not having been brought up on appeal, this court, under the authority of section 501 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides for the perfection of incomplete records, issued the necessary orders directing that they be brought here and united with the record of this case on appeal as an integral part thereof.<br\/><br\/>We have made a very careful examination and inspection of the records in the two cases referred to, in order to ascertain whether the judgments entered therein were or were not erroneous, and we have concluded that the judgments entered by this court in both cases were justly and properly rendered in accordance with the pleadings and the evidence set out therein; and further that in each case the judgment entered is in accord with the very right of the cause. Plaintiff specifically alleges that these judgments were erroneous, but it is very clear that that allegation is a mere conclusion of law, and of course, under the above set out rules of pleading as well as in accord with the dictates of good sense, it is entitled to no consideration, and is not to be taken as admitted by the demurrer, when found to conflict with the basic facts well pleaded in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>Disregarding for the present all questions of practice and procedure, and looking only to the undisputed facts in the record of the former cases, and the actual results flowing from the judgments of the court in those cases, it appears that Alzua, a judgment creditor of a certain business association or partnership, by filing an indemnity bond in favor of the sheriff, induced the sheriff to sell the property of the partners and turn over all the proceeds, some P12,000, to her; that she induced the sheriff so to do over the formal and vigorous protest and opposition of two minor children, the heirs of a deceased Spaniard (who will hereafter be referred to as \"the minors\"); that this court held that these minor children had a preferred credit for some P12,000 against the property thus sold; and that the alleged erroneous judgment was, in effect, a declaration by this court that Alzua and her bondsmen should pay over to the minors this sum of P12,000, which they induced the sheriff to turn over to her, but which the court was of opinion should have been turned over to the minors.<br\/><br\/>If the facts, upon which the court rested its conclusion that the minors had a preferred claim to the proceeds of the property sold by the sheriff, support the conclusion of the court in that regard, it will readily be seen that Alzua's extraordinary claim for P15,000 damages is based solely upon defendant's intervention in certain legal proceedings as a result of which Alzua was compelled to pay over to these minor children P12,000 to which they were justly entitled, and which Alzua had received from the common debtor without being justly entitled thereto. Let us see what are these facts. Fortunately there can be no question in regard to them. Case No. 4017 was submitted on an agreed statement of facts, and there is no dispute as to the facts in Case No. 5719.<br\/><br\/>Alzua's claim to the partnership funds in the hands o\u00a3 the sheriff rested on a judgment entered September 7, 1905, which is expressly based upon a document dated April 15, 1903, whereby the partners acknowledge the receipt from Alzua of the amount for which judgment was rendered.<br\/><br\/>The claim of the minors rested upon the express provisions of article 7 of the articles of partnership of the mercantile association known as \"Viuda de Soler y J. Riu,\" a public document, executed by the partners, and duly inscribed in the mercantile registry of the city of Manila on the 30th of June, 1902, which this court construed to be an acknowledgment of indebtedness by the partnership to the minors in the sum of 9,868.29 pesos Mexican currency.<br\/><br\/>If the court properly construed this clause of the articles of partnership, there can be no possible question as to the right of the minors to a preferred claim in the proceeds of the sheriff's sale of the partnership property, and to have this right respected by the sheriff in the distribution of any partnership funds in his hands for that purpose. It is unnecessary to repeat here the reasoning upon which this conclusion rests. The reasoning will be found set out in full in numerous reported opinions wherein we have heretofore construed the provision of statutory law as applied in like cases. It is sufficient here to say that under the provisions of the Spanish Code as modified by the Acts of the Commission abrogating the bankruptcy provision of that code, we have heretofore decided in a number of maturely considered cases, that:<br\/><blockquote>\"Article 1924 of the Civil Code places judgment creditors in the order of their respective judgments in the third class of preferred creditors.<br\/><br\/>\"While article 1924 of the Civil Code was repealed by the enactment of the Code of Civil Procedure in so far as it is applicable to cases of bankruptcy and estates of deceased persons, its provisions are not limited to such cases and it remains in full force and effect when by intervention or otherwise a judgment creditor is a proper party to distribution proceedings of the funds or estate of his judgment debtor and duly asserts his rights as a preferred creditor.<br\/><br\/>\"A creditor does not acquire a lien upon the property of his debtors by virtue of the filing of his complaint, the judgment, the issue of execution, or the levy thereunder, other than the mere right to a preference in the distribution of the funds or estate of his judgment debtor in those cases wherein, by intervention or otherwise, the judgment creditor is a proper party to the distribution proceedings and duly asserts his right as a preferred creditor.\" (Syllabus, Peterson vs. Newberry, 6 Phil. Rep., 260.)<br\/><br\/>\"A personal obligation evidenced by a public instrument is entitled to preference over an obligation upon a promissory note merged into a final judgment which bore date subsequent to that of the public instrument.\" (Syllabus, Olivares vs. Hoskyn &amp; Co., 2 Phil. Rep., 689.)<br\/><br\/>\"Credits or debts evidenced by a public document or final judgment shall be preferred in accordance with their respective dates. A debt evidenced by a public document dated the 9th of May, 1905, takes preference over a final judgment dated August 1 of the same year.\" (Syllabus, Gochuico vs. Ocampo, 7 Phil Rep., 15.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Despite the vigorous contention of American counsel, relying on principles and practice quite generally recognized in the United States, we have steadfastly adhered to the doctrine laid down in the cases just cited, and many others of like tenor; and we hold that not only is it well founded in the substantive and procedural law of these Islands, but that the development of this doctrine in a long and unbroken line of decisions, beginning with the case of Martinez vs. Holliday, Wise &amp; Co. in the first volume of our reports, makes it substantially a rule of property in these Islands not subject to change except by legislative enactment. (Martinez vs. Holliday, Wise &amp; Co., 1 Phil. Rep., 194; Olivares vs. Hoskyn &amp; Co., 2 Phil. Rep., 689; Peterson vs. Newberry, 6 Phil. Rep., 260; Gochuico vs. Ocampo, 7 Phil. Rep., 15; Soler vs. Alzoua, 8 Phil. Rep., 539; Strong vs. Van Buskirk, 10 Phil. Rep., 190; Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos vs. Jeanjaquet, 12 Phil. Rep., 195; McMicking vs. Martinez, 15 Phil. Rep., 204.)<br\/><br\/>It is very clear, therefore, that upon the undisputed facts in the records of cases No. 4017 and No. 5719, the minors were entitled to a preference over Alzua in the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the partnership goods, if this court properly construed the provisions of article 7 of the duly registered articles of partnership as an admission of indebtedness to the minors. The adjudication of this question presents some difficulty, but we adhere to our former holding that the articles of partnership expressly admit and recognize the existence of this obligation.<br\/><br\/>This seventh clause of the articles of partnership is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Seventh. Mrs. Martinez states that her sons Don Manuel and Don Enrique Soler y Martinez, both minors, have an interest in the capital supplied by her amounting to nine thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight pesos and twenty-nine cents, which is the sum which went to them according to the instrument of adjudication of the property left by their father, Don Manuel Soler y. Cendra, executed before the notary of this city, Don Antonio Costa y Fabrega, on the twenty-second of March last; but that this participation by no means ever can affect the partner Mr. Riu, because all the questions which by virtue of such participation may arise will be on account and risk of the said Mrs. Martinez with full and complete indemnity of the company formed by the present instrument.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It will be seen that this clause of the articles expressly admits that, of the capital brought into the partnership, some nine thousand and odd pesos belonged to the minors, who (as is agreed on all sides and especially insisted upon by Alzua) were not partners. Taken by itself, and without any further restrictive provisions in the articles, we think that this admission must be taken to be an admission and an express recognition of indebtedness to that amount by the partnership. But it is contended that the meaning and effect of this formal recognition of indebtedness is modified by those clauses of the article which undertake to limit and restrict the liability of the partnership and of one of the partners in regard thereto.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Sunico vs, Chuidian (9 Phil. Rep., 625) we had occasion to examine some very analogous provisions in articles of partnership of a duly registered mercantile association, whereby the organizers of the association, after admitting the indebtedness of the partnership to certain minors (relatives of some of the partners in that case as in this), undertook to prescribe the conditions under which this indebtedness would be paid. In that case, after an exhaustive examination of the respective rights and liabilities of the partnership and the partners in mercantile associations duly registered under the provisions of the Code of Commerce, we said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It does not appear, however, that the plaintiff was a member of said partnership, or that he ever agreed to this clause of the articles of partnership. On the contrary, it expressly appears from an examination of the said articles that he took no part therein, that he was not a partner, and that the debt due him stands on the same footing as any other indebtedness of the company, except that it is expressly recognized in the said articles. Under the circumstances the plaintiff is not and can not be bound by the provisions of the articles of partnership relied upon by the appellants nor can they have the effect of postponing his right of recovery, as contended by the appellant.\" (Sunico vs. Chuidian, 9 Phil. Rep., 633.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Without repeating here the discussion in the Chuidian case we hold that the minors not being members of the partnership, and never having agreed to the articles of partnership, the debt to them recognized in clause 7 thereof, stands on the same footing as any other indebtedness of the company, except that it is expressly recognized in the said articles. The mutual agreements of the partners Riu and Martinez were and are of course mutually binding upon them, but such agreements should not be permitted to deprive the minors of their right to recover their money from a mercantile association, which solemnly acknowledged in a public instrument that it had received money or property of the minors amounting to some nine thousand and odd pesos, and made use of it for partnership purposes.<br\/><br\/>The only substantial objections which can be, and have been urged to this construction of the partnership articles, are that the partner Visitacion Martinez was the widowed mother of the minors, that as such she had a usufructory interest in the property of the minors as \"legal administratrix\" thereof, that in using their property as part of the capital of the partnership she was acting within her legal rights, that as \"legal administratrix\" of this property she had a right to enter into such contracts with relation thereto as she might deem proper, and that she did in fact agree in clause 7 of the articles of partnership that neither the partnership nor her partner would become liable therefor.<br\/><br\/>This contention would merit very serious consideration, and certainly could not be passed over lightly, were it not for the fact that counsel expressly agreed in the \"agreed statement of facts\" upon which Case No. 4017 was submitted \"that during none of the times above mentioned has Visitacion Martinez been the legal guardian of the said minors,\" referring to the time of the organization of the partnership and the incidents relating thereto which are set out in that agreement. This express admission of fact by counsel completely cuts the ground from under their feet, and leaves them helpless in their attempt in this court to inject into clause 7 of the articles the meaning and effect for which they contend. Indeed, so clearly did they themselves recognize this, that in their brief in that case in this court (p. 3, brief for Emilia Alzua et al.) they say that this clause \"slipped into the agreement\" (<i>se ha colado en el convenio<\/i>) without their attention being called to it. A fruitless attempt is made, of course, to explain it away, but an admission such as this, made by experienced counsel in an agreed statement of facts and submitted in open court at the very outset of the litigation, is a \"stubborn child,\" and can not be easily brushed aside. Indeed its legal effect is too apparent to admit of any other explanation than that the fact thus admitted is true., or that counsel made an egregious and inexcusable blunder.<br\/><br\/>It is nowhere contended or suggested that any unfair advantage was taken of counsel in the preparation of the \"agreed statement of facts.\" No claim is made that astute counsel for her adversary hoodwinked or surprised counsel for Alzua. There is no intimation of sharp practice. And indeed the only explanation of the presence of this unrestricted stipulation of fact in the \"agreed statement of facts\" signed by counsel, and upon which the case went to trial, is the bare assertion of counsel that it slipped into the agreement without their attention being called to it. This explanation does not of course explain the fact away. It merely amounts to an admission that had counsel for Alzua appreciated the legal effect of this admission as fully before the case was tried as after they had heard the arguments of opposing counsel, they would not have submitted that case on \"the agreed statement of facts.\"<br\/><br\/>The \"agreed statement of facts\" was a carefully prepared instrument in writing, signed by two separate firms of competent attorneys representing the various parties to the cause, and it was formally submitted to the court with the prayer that the rights of the minors to the partnership property should be adjudicated in accordance therewith. It is futile now, as it was futile on appeal from the judgment rendered upon that agreed statement of facts, to ask this court to disregard a fact thus stipulated as true, or to decline to give it its manifest legal effect in adjudicating the rights of the parties to the action. In the absence of proof of sharp practice or surprise, neither this court nor the court below has or had any lawful authority so to do; and there can be no doubt or question as to the legal effect and meaning which must be given the admission that Alzua was not the \"legal guardian\" of the minor children, in an agreed statement of fact, written in English, and signed by two separate firms of American attorneys, long after the promulgation of the new Code of Civil Procedure had established American rules of practice and procedure in civil cases in these Islands.<br\/><br\/>In this connection it may not be improper to say, in passing, that if there ever was any merit in the claim of the plaintiff Alzua to a preference over the minors in the distribution of the partnership funds (which, however, we do not recognize), this claim must necessarily have been based on the fact, if it be a fact, that in executing the articles of partnership and in using the funds or property of the minors as a part of the capital of the partnership, the widow Martinez was acting not merely for herself but also in her representative capacity as legal guardian or administratrix of the property of the minors. So that if plaintiff Alzua has been deprived of any right or property to which she was entitled, her loss is clearly and directly traceable to the fatal and inexcusable blunder of counsel in admitting at the very outset of the litigation that she was not their legal guardian, if in fact she was.<br\/><br\/>What has been said sufficiently demonstrates, we think, that disregarding all technical questions of pleading and practice, and looking only to the undisputed and indisputable facts out of which the litigation arose, as disclosed by the complaint and the court records incorporated therein, the substantial rights of the parties to that litigation were correctly adjudicated by this court on appeal; and we conclude that the claim of plaintiff Alzua for damages alleged to have resulted from the entry of the judgment of this court in case No. 5719 is not sustained by the facts well pleaded in the complaint\u2014the effect of that judgment being merely to require her to pay over to the minors the amount which, by the filing of an indemnity bond, she had induced the sheriff improperly to turn over to her instead of to the minors who were justly entitled thereto.<br\/><br\/>But plaintiff Alzua, through her counsel, insists that at various stages of the proceedings, this court, instigated by the defendant in this action, improperly disregarded certain technical rules of practice and procedure; and that the judgments actually entered in cases No. 4017 and No. 5719 could not and would not have been entered had the court proceeded, with due regard to these technical rules of practice and procedure, to apply the law in all its rigor to the cases submitted to it. It might, perhaps, be a sufficient answer to this contention to say that mistakes of procedure or of reasoning made by the court in arriving at its conclusions could not have occasioned any damage to the plaintiff, if the conclusions actually arrived at were sound, and if the judgments which she avers were erroneously entered merely required her to do something which it was her duty to do whether those judgments were entered or not. But the facts well pleaded in the complaint, and the records of cases No. 4017 and No, 5719 incorporated therein, justify us in going further, and after a thorough review of all the proceedings, we hold and think we should formally so declare, that the judgments complained of were not erroneously entered and that they dispose of the issues submitted to the court, not only in accord with substantial justice, but with due regard for sound rules of practice and procedure and \"agreeably to the law in the Philippine Islands.\"<br\/><br\/>Without extending this decision intolerably, we can not enter into an exhaustive discussion and argument in support of each and all of our rulings throughout this extended litigation; but we shall endeavor to notice the various contentions on which plaintiff Alzua by her counsel bases her asseverations as to error in the proceedings had on appeal, indicating as briefly as may be the grounds on which we hold that these contentions are not well founded.<br\/><br\/>It is contended that this court erred in deciding these cases on the theory of preferred credits. Counsel direct attention to the fact that when the minors, by their guardian, first intervened in the proceedings, they set up a claim of ownership in the partnership property which had been levied upon by the sheriff, and, claiming an interest in the property as partners, demanded that he release his levy; and attention is particularly directed to the fact that the formal complaint, upon which the minors instituted the injunction proceedings against the sheriff, reiterated this claim of an interest in the partnership property. Counsel insist that the minors themselves having thus rested their right to intervene in the sheriff's proceedings on a claim of ownership, this court should have strictly limited itself to the consideration of that question when the litigation was submitted to it on appeal.<br\/><br\/>While it is true that at the outset of the litigation the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i> of the minors did, in fact, rest their claim of a right of intervention on an erroneous construction or misconception of the articles of partnership, and that he asserted on their behalf a claim of an interest in the partnership property as partners, nevertheless, the record clearly discloses that this claim was promptly abandoned, and that thereafter, the contention of the minors was steadfastly and squarely planted on their claim of a right to intervene in the proceedings as preferred creditors of the common debtor.<br\/><br\/>The very first printed brief connected with this litigation submitted to this court on appeal (filed on June 5, 1906, by counsel for the minors in case No. 4017, wherein the minors were plaintiffs and Alzua and the sheriff were defendants), contains on page 4 the following: \"In the court below the question as to whether the minors could be in equity considered partners in the business levied upon was abandoned and stress laid upon the point that the evidence showed that the minors had a claim <i>preferred over that<\/i> of defendant, Emilia Alzua's, under article of the Civil Code, No. 1924, 3 A.\" The reply brief filed by counsel for Alzua, opens on page 1 with the following admission: \"The statement of facts contained in appellant's brief is substantially correct.\" It is true that counsel for Alzua, in the argument in their brief, contended that the minors should not be permitted thus to change their ground, without modifying or amending the original complaint as filed in the action, because counsel for the defense had directed their defense against the allegations of the complaint and not against the claim as preferred creditors then being submitted to the Supreme Court. But counsel, in their brief, nowhere modified or limited their admission of the substantial correctness of the statement of counsel for the minors, that in the court below the minors' claim to a right to interevene as partners \"was abandoned, and stress laid\" upon their claim as preferred creditors.<br\/><br\/>Without considering for the present the right of the minors thus to abandon their claim of ownership and lay stress on their interest in the property as preferred creditors until they had first formally amended their complaint, <i>it is quite clear from counsel's own admission, that as far back as the date of the trial in the Court of First Instance of the injunction proceedings in case No. 4017, and before the sale of the partnership property, and before the proceeds thereof were turned over to Alzua, the sheriff and Alzua, who were defendants in those proceedings, and their counsel, were formally notified of the minors' claim to an interest in the property as preferred creditors<\/i>; and from that time until the conclusion of the litigation in this court and the entry of final judgment in case No. 5719, the records disclose that their contentions were persistently and unwaveringly based on that theory.<br\/><br\/>Let us now consider whether they had a right to be heard upon this contention, and whether this court erred in supporting their contention and directing as it did that the court below enter the necessary decree to secure their rights thereunder. We have already shown that under the law in force in these Islands, and in accordance with the uniform doctrine laid down in a long line of decisions of this court, the minors had a right as preferred creditor to have their right of preference respected in the distribution of the funds of the sheriff, if they duly asserted that right; and the only further question that remains to be considered is whether they did so assert it, and whether this right was duly submitted to the court for adjudication. In case No. 4017 (the injunction proceedings), the stipulation of facts, among other things, sets out in full the articles of partnership, and this court's judgment as to the minors' right to a preference was expressly based on its construction of the provisions of those articles. In submitting the stipulation of facts, the various parties (the minors, Alzua, and the sheriff) by their respective counsel concluded as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is respectfully prayed by the parties hereto that the honorable court upon the above statement of facts decide the rights of the said minors to the property in question.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In accord with this request this court did decide the rights of the minors to the property in question, and held that while they had no rights thereto as partners or owners, they had the interest therein which the law, under certain circumstances, gives to preferred creditors with all the rights springing from such an interest. It is very clear, therefore, that the claim now urged that this judgment of the court was erroneous, and caused damage to the plaintiff Alzua, in so far as it is based on the mere fact that the court examined the statement of facts thus submitted, and adjudicated the right of the minors to the property in accordance with the prayer of all the parties to the action, is so specious that it needs only this statement of the facts to refute it.<br\/><br\/>But even if the stipulation entered into by the parties had not expressly and formally prayed the court to decide the rights of the minors thereon, the claim that this court erred in adjudicating the cause upon the theory of preferred credits could not be sustained, and is in direct conflict with the uniform practice and procedure of the courts in this jurisdiction. Under our system of pleading it is the duty of the courts to grant the relief to which the parties are shown to be entitled by their allegations and the facts proven at the trial, and the mere fact that they themselves misconstrue the leaf effect of the facts thus alleged and proven will not prevent the court from placing the just construction thereon, and adjudicating the issues, accordingly. Indeed, under the liberal system of amendments authorized in our Code of Civil Procedure, amendments may be and have always been freely allowed to a complaint at any time before final judgment, so as to prevent a miscarriage of justice; and in such cases, the court in rendering its judgment not infrequently treats such amendments as actually made without the necessity for formal correction. (Code of Civil Procedure, section 110; Bliss on Code Pleading, 161, 162, and note; Brocal vs. Molina, 5 Phil. Rep., 507; Gsell vs. Yap Jue, 6 Phil. Rep., 143; De la Rosa vs. Arenas, 7 Phil. Rep., 556; Fianza vs. Reavis, 7 Phil. Rep., 610; Quison VH. Salud, 12 Phil. Rep., 109; Espiritu vs. Crossfield, 14 Phil. Rep., 588; Alonso vs. Villamor, 16 Phil. Rep., 315.) When it appears, as it does from the records of the cases incorporated into the complaint in this action, that the facts stipulated support a certain theory of the case, and that after abandoning the theory of recovery upon which the original complaint was framed the plaintiff relied upon and \"laid stress upon\" the theory supported by the facts disclosed by \"an agreed statement of facts\" submitted to the court below, it is absurd to contend that on appeal, the appellate court erred in deciding the case according to the facts stipulated and the theory of the case actually relied upon by the plaintiff, rather than upon the abandoned theory of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The next contention as to alleged error of procedure and practice which we shall notice, is based on the fact that this court gave judgment against the plaintiff Alzua, and the bondsmen upon the indemnity bond to the sheriff, without holding the sheriff himself liable. It appears from the record that the complaint in case No. 5719 was dismissed as to the sheriff on demurrer in the court below; that no exception was taken to the court's action dismissing the complaint as to him; and that as a result this court never was called upon to adjudicate the liability of the sheriff nor to review the action of the court below in this regard. It is not necessary for us now to discuss or decide whether, upon appeal, we would have followed the general doctrine holding the sheriff liable as well as the indemnitor and his bondsmen, or whether we would have followed the doctrine laid down in some states whose statutory regulations prescribing the duties of sheriffs are very similar to our own, whereby the sheriff on taking a sufficient indemnity bond is relieved from liability, the indemnitor and his bondsmen being alone held liable. It is sufficient, for the purposes of this decision, to say that the question of the liability of the sheriff never was submitted to us.<br\/><br\/>But it is contended that it is a legal absurdity to hold the indemnitor and his bondsmen liable, unless the sheriff in whose favor the bond was given is also held liable. In the discussion of the case much was made of this contention, and a great outcry was made as to what counsel for Alzua is pleased to describe as the palpable and inexcusable absurdity of the position of the court in this regard. But however absurd the action of the court in this regard may seem to counsel, we deem it a sufficient answer to quote as a complete justification of our action the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Lovejoy vs. Murray (3 Wallace, 1-19, 70 U. S.).<br\/><blockquote>\"The demand for indemnity, and the giving of it by the defendants, proceeded upon the supposition that the sheriff would without it go no further in that direction, but would give up the property to the claimant, the present plaintiff, and make his peace on the best terms he could. By the present statute of Iowa he had a right to do this, if the plaintiff in attachment refused to assume the hazard of indemnifying him. And if there were no such statute, he had a right to deliver the property to the claimant, and risk a suit by the plaintiff in attachment, rather than a contest with a rightful claimant of the goods.<br\/><br\/>\"The giving of the bond by the present defendants must, therefore, be held equivalent to a personal interference in the course of the proceeding, by directing or requesting the sheriff to hold the goods as if they were the property of the defendants in attachment. In doing this they assumed the direction and control of the sheriff's future action, so far as it might constitute a trespass? and they became to that extent the principals, and he their agent in the transaction. This made them responsible for the continuance of the wrongful possession, and for the sale and conversion of the goods; in other words, for all the real damages which plaintiff sustained.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The faithful and exhaustive research of counsel, in this case, shows that there are conflicting authorities, not only on the main proposition, but on several incidental and collateral points closely connected with it. The two propositions, however, seem to be conceded by all the authorities, which bear with more or less force on the main question, and which may as well be stated here.<br\/><br\/>\"1. That persons engaged in committing the same trespass are joint and several trespassers, and not joint trespassers exclusively. Like persons liable on a joint and several contract, they may be all sued in one action; or one may be sued alone, and cannot plead the non-joinder of others in abatement; and so far is the doctrine of several liability carried, that the defendants, where more than one are sued in the same action, may sever in their pleas, and the jury may find several verdicts, and on several verdicts of guilty may assess different sums as damages.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In his contention in the case at bar, senior counsel for Alzua falls into the same error as that which led him astray in his argument on the appeal of case No. 5719. Then as now, he insisted that there could be no liability on the part of Alzua and her bondsmen if the sheriff himself was not held liable. Accordingly he rested his contention on appeal, in that case, substantially on this single proposition, and apparently did not deem it necessary to support it in his brief with argument or the citation of authority. As we understand his contention it is that case No. 5719 was an action on the indemnity bond; that the bond having been given to the sheriff to indemnify him and his official bondsmen, the minors should not have been permitted to institute or maintain such an action; and that even if they could institute and maintain an action on the bond, they could not recover, unless and until it appeared that the sheriff had actually incurred the losses which the bond was given to indemnify. But the action in question was not, in this technical sense, an action on the bond. It is true that the complaint sets out in detail the facts touching the execution of the bond, and alleges that the execution of the bond rendered Alzua and her bondsmen liable for the damages for which joint and several judgment was prayed against the defendants. To this extent, and to this extent only, was the action founded on the indemnity bond. But the action was instituted against the sheriff and his deputy, jointly with Alzua and her bondsmen, and manifestly could not have been directed against the sheriff \"on the bond\" of indemnity; and it sets forth facts, which when proven, clearly established the minors' right to recovery against Alzua and her bondsmen under the doctrine of the case of Lovejoy vs. Murray just cited.<br\/><br\/>So much has been said as to the alleged palpable error of this court in holding Alzua and her bondsmen directly liable to the minors, notwithstanding the dismissal of the complaint as to the sheriff, that at the risk of unduly prolonging this opinion, we here insert citations from the opinions of two of the courts of last resort in the United States, wherein contentions quite analogous to those of counsel for Alzua were ruled upon adversely.<br\/><br\/>The supreme court of appeals of New York in the case of Dyett vs. Hyman et al. (129 N. Y. (Sickels), 351) held that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The execution of a bond to a sheriff indemnifying him against damages resulting from an unlawful levy and sale of property made by him, presumptively establishes the liability of the obligors as principals for the original trespass committed by the sheriff.<br\/><br\/>\"Those thus connected with the original wrong are jointly and severally liable with the sheriff, and it is no defense, in an action by the owner of the property against one o) more of the wrongdoers, to show that others were not joined as defendants who are also liable.<br\/><br\/>\"Where an action is brought against several alleged joint wrongdoers, the plaintiff may at any time, by leave of the court, discontinue the action as to one or more of the defendants.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>So the supreme court of Arkansas, in the case of Rice rs. Wood (31 L. R. A., 644), commented as follows on contentions of counsel almost identical with those now urged in this court:<br\/><blockquote>\"The appellees contend that the judgment should be affirmed, without regard to whether there were errors committed against the appellants at the trial, because, as they claim, the suit instituted by the plaintiffs cannot be maintained under the law. They claim that the bond was personal to the sheriff, and that he alone can sue on it, and that he can not sue until he has been damaged. It is also said that the statute makes no provisions for an indemnity bond in attachment cases; and it is further urged as a defense against the action of the plaintiffs that it is doubtful whether the defendants, by signing the bond, became participants in the trespass; and, if they did become so, it is claimed that they could only be sued in trespass, and not on the bond.<br\/><br\/>\"If this suit was by the sheriff against the defendants on the bond, it would be necessary for him to show how and in what respect he had been damaged; and in such a case it might be necessary to determine whether the statute contemplates the indemnity bond mentioned, although it is questionable even in that case whether the defendants, having executed the bond under the circumstances, would be heard at all to contest its legality. But there is no such case here, for this is not a suit on the bond, but a suit against the defendants to recover the value of the plaintiffs' goods, which it is claimed were taken to pay the debt of another, and for which taking it is alleged the defendants were responsible.<br\/><br\/>\"The contention of appellees that it is doubtful whether they became participants in the trespass by making the bond in our opinion is not well taken. It seems to us that that act made them the real principals in the transaction. In order to maintain the action, it is only necessary for plaintiffs to show: First, that they owned the goods taken; second, their value; and, third, that the defendants participated in the taking or caused the same. And the right to maintain the suit cannot be made to depend upon the existence or nonexistence of any statute. It is simply the common right that everyone has to recover the value of his property when wrongfully taken. The plaintiffs, if they owned the goods, could have sued McGuire and the sheriff and the defendants jointly, if they desired, or either of them separately.\" (Lovejoy vs. Murray, 70 U. S., 3 Wall., 19, 18 L. ed., 134.)<br\/><\/blockquote>We rely, without further discussion, upon the reasoning and authority of the cases just cited, in support of our holding that it was not error in the judgment of this court entered in case No. 5719, to hold the sheriff's indemnitor and her bondsmen liable, notwithstanding the fact that the complaint had been dismissed, as against the sheriff, upon demurrer in the court below. As will be seen from the reasoning in the citations from those decisions, the action might have been instituted and maintained against the indemnitor and her bondsmen without including the sheriff as a party\u2014their liability arising out of the execution of the bond whereby the sheriff was induced to improperly distribute funds to the indemnitor Alzua to which the minors had a preferred claim.<br\/><br\/>The next contention as to procedural error in the decision of the former cases which we shall briefly notice, is that the court improperly treated the facts found in case No. 4017 as conclusive in case No. 5719. Counsel's entire argument on this point on the appeal of the latter case was thus briefly stated on page 3 of their printed brief: \"The appellants invoke the case reported in volume 8, page 539, Philippine Reports, as res adjudicate. That is in fact virtually the same case. There is, however, one great and fundamental difference, Visitacion Martinez was not a party in that case. This defendant should be the only and real defendant. The case referred to can therefore not be invoked as res adjudicata of the questions invoked in the present suit. The former suit was a petition for an injunction. There was no judgment asked other than injunction.\"<br\/><br\/>It will be seen that counsel recognized and admitted the fact that the two cases were virtually the same except for what he describes as the \"one great and fundamental difference,\" that Visitacion Martinez was not a party in that case. But an examination of the pleadings makes it very clear that this objection was not well founded. It is true that Visitacion Martinez, and we may add her partner Riu, the members of the mercantile association, were made parties defendant to the second action and were not parties to the former action. But it also appears that there was no connection whatever between the cause of action set out in the complaint as it affected Mrs. Martinez and her partner Riu, and that set out against the sheriff, the indemnitor, and his bondsmen. The complaint alleged as one cause of action that the partners were indebted to plaintiff for goods or money had and received which had never been paid, and this cause of action was directed solely and exclusively against the partners. The cause of action against the sheriff, jointly with Alzua and her bondsmen, was in substance that they had distributed and appropriated the proceeds of the sale of certain partnership property, in utter disregard of the minors' preferential interest therein. Manifestly the real parties to this cause of action were the same as those in the former case, No. 4017; and as between them, the cause of action, the subject matter and the parties being \"virtually\" and substantially the same, the court properly held the facts found in the former case conclusive in the second. It may be admitted that the facts found in the judgment in the former case could not properly be held conclusive as to the separate cause of action in which the partners were the real and in fact the only defendants, but this in no wise affects the correctness of the ruling as to the cause of action in which the sheriff, his indemnitor (Alzua) and her bondsmen were the real and only parties.<br\/><br\/>The truth of the matter appears to be, that when that action came up on appeal the contest was directed exclusively to the issue between the minors on the one hand, and the sheriff and his indemnitors on the other. Mrs. Martinez in the court below had confessed judgment, and the other partner, whatever may have been his rights, was not represented by counsel on appeal, or at least no brief was filed on his behalf. It may be that the reasoning of the opinion, being exclusively directed to the contention of counsel as to the cause of action as to which the minors and the indemnitor and her bondsmen were the only real parties, did not set forth in sufficient detail the grounds upon which the action of the court as to the partner, Riu, was based. But the action of the court relative to the cause of action as to which the partners were parties, could not and did not have any bearing or effect on its adjudication of the cause of action as to which Alzua and her bondsmen were parties; and it certainly furnishes no ground for complaint so far as she is concerned. The two separate causes of action having no substantial relation one to the other, and the defendants who were sought to be held upon the different causes of action not being the same, separate actions might have been, and in good practice ought to have been instituted on each separate cause of action. But since no objection had been made on this ground in the court below, that question was neither raised nor considered when the case came up on appeal.<br\/><br\/>To our mind these observations satisfactorily dispose of counsel's objections in this regard; but to make it very clear that we are announcing no new doctrine as to the terms upon which the plea of res judicata may be considered, we here insert some citations from textbook and judicial authority.<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Estoppel by judgment; Effect of additional parties<\/i>.\u2014It is not always a conclusive objection to the admissibility of a record as an estoppel or as a bar that the parties to the former action included some who are not joined in the second action, or vice versa.\" (Black on Judgments, vol. 2, par. 543.)<br\/><br\/>\"The fact that parties in the first suit are not identically the same as those in the second, when the first case was decided on the merits, and not upon an exception to joinder or non-joinder of parties, is certainly no answer to the plea (of former recovery) ; otherwise, no matter how often a case be decided, the parties might renew the litigation by simply joining with them a new party.\" (Gerardin vs. Dean, 49 Tex., 243.)<br\/><br\/>\"The objection that the first action was between other parties is not well grounded, and has no basis in fact to rest it upon the principle of <i>res inter alios acta<\/i>. That principle applies where the party against whom the record is offered was not himself a party to it. In such case, the general rule is that the record is not admissible. But here this defendant was a party to that record, and the objection in fact is that other persons were also parties thereto. As we understand the rule, that single fact alone constitutes no valid objection to the admission of the record.\" (Larum vs. Wilmer, 35 Iowa, 244.)<br\/><\/blockquote>In this connection, counsel also contend that the court fell into manifest error, in that it applied the doctrine of <i>res judicata<\/i> in case No. 5719, although the parties themselves had not, as he now alleges, formally \"pleaded or introduced the decision in cause No. 4017 in evidence.\" As will be seen from the citation from counsel's own brief on the appeal in case No. 5719 (<i>supra<\/i>) he himself directly invited the attention of the court to the fact that his adversary \"invoked the case reported in volume 8, Philippine Reports, page 539, as <i>res judicata<\/i>;\" but in his argument in that brief there was no intimation that this claim had not been well pleaded. On the contrary, counsel unqualifiedly admitted that the doctrine had been invoked, and limited his objections to its consideration to the alleged failure of identity of parties. Clearly, it was his own fault if the court, in good faith, accepted his statement of the fact, in this regard, and took it for granted that this claim had been invoked in due form. Furthermore, in his written motion for a rehearing, after the opinion was filed, and before final judgment was entered, counsel again objected to the application of the doctrine of <i>res judicata<\/i> in reliance upon the former decision, and again based his argument on the ground that the parties to the different actions were not identical, <i>without intimating or suggesting that the claim had not been well pleaded<\/i>. Indeed, the first intimation by counsel that the doctrine had not been technically invoked occurs in an assignment of error, <i>submitted after the judgment had become final<\/i>, in the preparation of the record for an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, which, for some reason which does not appear, was thereafter abandoned. There can be no question that the court was justified in assuming that had there been any defect in the form in which the doctrine had been invoked, counsel would have been the first to direct the attention of the court to that fact, <i>unless he intended to waive the objection<\/i>. It comes with ill grace from his mouth to charge the defendant in this action with negligence and bad faith, because he failed to study the record in order to discover formal defects therein which counsel himself neglected to point out in his brief, or in his motion for a rehearing after the opinion had been filed.<br\/><br\/>It is not a part of the duty of an appellate court to search out formal or even substantial procedural defects in the proceedings had in the court below, to which its attention is not directed by counsel in the bill of exceptions, in the printed and written briefs, or in oral argument on appeal. See many cases cited in 2 Cyc., 1014 and 1015. That is the duty of counsel, and their brief should furnish the court and opposing counsel with full notice of the points of law which they desire to establish, together with the arguments and authorities upon which they raise or rest their contentions. (Black L. Diet., 155; Anonymous, 40 III., 57. See also Anderson L. Diet.; Bouvier L. Diet; Haberlau vs. Lake Shore, etc., R. Co., 73 111. App., 261; Elliott App. Proc, par. 438.) If counsel is not sufficiently industrious and alive to the interests of his client to bring such matters to the attention of the court, in the event that he thinks they have any bearing on his case pending on appeal, neither he nor his client has any just cause for complaint, after final judgment rendered, because the appellate court appears to have disregarded such alleged defects, or to have treated them as waived by counsel by his silence when he had his day in court.<br\/><br\/>It is worthy of observation in this connection that under the \"better doctrine\" as laid down in the courts of last resort in the United States, as appears from the citation below, final and conclusive effect could and should have been given, under all the circumstances of this case, to the prior adjudication, whether it was or was not set up by formal plea, if it was in fact set up in the course of the evidence; or what is substantially equivalent, if it was \"invoked\" and thus brought to the attention of the court, and by admission of counsel, tacit or express, objection was waived as to defects in the technical form in which the claim was submitted.<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Former recovery as a bar; Necessity of pleading prior adjudication<\/i>.\u2014Upon the question, whether a party who intends to rely upon a former adjudication as conclusive of the matters presently in issue must plead it as an estoppel, on pain of being deprived of its benefit as a claim or defense if he omits to do so, or whether he may simply introduce the record in evidence, with the same final effect as if it had been pleaded, the authorities are by no means in harmony.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"In the United States there has been great contrariety of opinion. Numerous cases, in accordance with the English rule, hold that the benefit of an estoppel by record is waived unless it is seasonably interposed by plea. In one state it is said that if the circumstances and course of proceedings admit, a defendant who relies upon a former judgment must plead it, so as to give the plaintiff an opportunity to set up any objection he may have to its validity. In another, 'it is the settled rule of pleading that where a party makes a judgment of a court the foundation of his action or defense, he must make the record of such judgment, or a transcript of it, a part of the pleading setting it up, as in case of written instruments. Former recovery cannot be given in evidence under the general denial.'<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*******<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"But these views, as we shall presently show, are not supported by the majority of the decisions of the American courts. On the contrary, <i>the general tendency is to attach the same final and conclusive effect to a prior adjudication wherever and whenever it is set up<\/i>, whether that be done by plea or in the course of the evidence.\" (Black on Judgments, vol. 2, par. 783.)<br\/><\/blockquote>One other alleged error of practice and procedure remains to be noticed. Counsel lay much stress upon the action of this court in correcting and amending the original, memorandum order filed with the clerk which directed the entry of a judgment affirming the judgment of the court below in case No. 4017, and thereupon directing the entry of a judgment revoking the judgment of the trial court. We are not now considering the objections to the intervention of the defendant in this regard. We here refer only to the objections to the action of the court in itself issuing the order dated July 29, 1907, ratifying, affirming and adopting as its own the corrections made by the defendant in the original order filed March 27, 1907, and at the same time directing the entry of judgment reversing the.judgment of the lower court. It is said that the court had no authority so to do.<br\/><br\/>That any such contention is seriously urged at this time is only explicable on the theory that counsel wholly fails to keep in mind the vital difference between an order of the court directing the entry of judgment by the clerk, and the judgment itself when duly entered in compliance with the order. For while we have no doubt that, under all the circumstances of this case, the court might and should have ordered the amendment of the judgment itself had it been actually entered; we admit that in that event there might have been some room for discussion as to the precise limitations and extent of the authority of the court thus to amend in matters of form and of substance a final judgment duly entered by the clerk. But we can not conceive that there can be any question as to the right of this court to correct and amend, in matters of form or of substance, its orders directing the entry of judgment at a later day, when such corrections or amendments are made prior to the actual entry of the judgment in compliance with the order of the court, before the record on appeal has been returned to the court below, and before any action has been or could have been taken on a motion for rehearing then pending. That such was the status of the case at the time the amending order was entered by the court is clearly disclosed by the most superficial examination of the record.<br\/><br\/>Such corrections have frequently been made from the earliest days of the organization of this court. Indeed the uniform practice whereby these orders are framed so as to postpone the entry of judgment by the clerk for a more or less extended period, usually twenty days from the filing of the order, has its explanation in the advantages which is believed are secured, by thus giving any one interested an opportunity to call the attention of the court to errors in orders directing the entry of judgment, which should be corrected. As a matter of practice, the court, <i>ex mero motu<\/i>, or on motion of an interested party, always makes such corrections when it appears that it has fallen into error in issuing such orders.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Arnedo vs. Llorente and Liongson (18 Phil. Rep., 257) after a somewhat extended examination of our own statutes and of the common-law rules as modified by practice and statutory regulation in the United States, we said:<br\/><blockquote>\"We conclude, therefore, that in the absence of statutory provisions expressly extending or limiting the time within which the courts in these Islands may vacate judgments and grant new trials or enter new judgments on the ground of error in fact or in law into which the court may be of opinion that it has fallen, these courts have no power thus to vacate judgments after they have become final in the sense that the party in whose favor they are rendered is entitled as of right, to have execution thereon, but that prior thereto the courts have plenary control over the proceedings including the judgment, and in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion may take such proper action in this regard as 'truth and justice require.' \"<br\/><\/blockquote>It cannot be doubted that under the rule thus laid down, this court had \"plenary control\" over the order in question, to correct errors of law or of fact by amending it in form or in substance.<br\/><br\/>What has been said disposes of all the substantial contentions of counsel as to alleged errors of procedure and practice in the course of the litigation under review. In the course of three days oral argument counsel for appellant touched upon some other alleged errors of this nature, but we do not deem it necessary to examine these contentions in detail. Time and space forbid. It must suffice to say that we have carefully considered all the objections raised by counsel, and that we are convinced that no error prejudicial to the rights of plaintiff Alzua was committed in the entry of the judgments in the cases mentioned in the complaint.<br\/><br\/><center>III.<br\/><\/center> <br\/>The third ground on which we rest our judgment affirming the judgment of the court below is that the complaint itself, read together with the exhibits and court records incorporated therein, sets forth facts which justify us in holding: First, that the surmises, conjectures, inferential allegations and specific charges of official misconduct and wrong-doing attributed to the defendant in the complaint are not well founded; and second, that the allegations of malice, of intent to injure the plaintiff and of bad faith on the part of the defendant are not sustained, and on the contrary are directly controverted, by the specific averments of fact well pleaded in the complaint, when read together with the court records referred to therein.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for plaintiff squarely rest her claim of a right of recovery upon their construction of the above cited provisions of section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure. They contend that although the defendant is a judge of a court of superior and general authority, he is liable, nevertheless, for damages resulting from acts done in the exercise of his judicial functions, if it appears that these acts were not done in \"good faith,\" or that they were not \"within the limits of his legal powers and jurisdiction.\" We have shown already that there can be no question that the defendant was acting strictly \"within the limits of his legal powers and jurisdiction\" when he did each and all of the acts well pleaded in the complaint. It necessarily results that upon plaintiff's own theory of the case, the defendant is not liable to respond in this action for alleged damages resulting from these acts unless it is made to appear that he was not acting in good faith. Bad faith is never presumed, and to support a judgment for such damages, <i>facts which justify the inference of a lack or absence of good faith must be alleged and proven<\/i>. (Civil Code, art. 434.) \"Good faith is the opposite of fraud, and of bad faith; and its nonexistence must be established by proof.\" (McConnel vs. Street, 17 111., 253.) \"The presumption against fraud, and its equivalent expression that good faith is presumed, or that fraud is never presumed,' declare the rule thai the burden of evidence as to the existence of fraud is upon the party alleging it. (Friedman vs. Shamblin, 117 Ala., 454, 23 So., 821; Levy vs. Scott, 115 Cal., 39, 46 Pac, 892; Webb vs. Marks, 10 Colo. App., 429, 51 Pac, 518; Baxter vs. Ellis, 57 Me., 178; Weybrich &amp; Co. vs. Harris, 31 KanM 92, 1 Pac, 271; State vs. Washington Steam Fire Co., 76 Miss., 449, 24 So., 877; Henry vs. Buddecke, 81 Mo.

W., 400, 58 Am. St. Rep., 65.)<br\/><br\/>Under the well-settled rules of pleading hereinbefore set out, neither legal conclusions nor conclusions or inferences of fact from facts not stated, nor incorrect inferences or conclusions from facts stated, are admitted by a demurrer to a complaint. Conclusions of this nature in no wise aid the pleading. The ultimate facts upon which such conclusions rest must be alleged, though merely probative or evidentiary facts may be and should be omitted.<br\/><br\/>It is not always easy to determine whether a pleading states a legal conclusion or merely states facts according to their legal effect, and the decisions are not entirely uniform in applying the rule. But it has been held that the following examples of allegations found in pleadings filed in the courts in the United States are mere legal conclusions, and that such allegations are not well pleaded unless the ultimate facts upon which they rest are set forth in the pleadings. <i>Averments that defendant's action was arbitrary<\/i> (Ricketts vs. Crewdson, 13 Wyo., 284, 79 Pac, 1042, 81 Pac, 1.), <i>or illegal<\/i> (Ricketts vs. Crewdson, 13 Wyo., 284, 79 Pac, 1042, 81 Pac, 1), <i>or wrongful or wrongfully done<\/i> (Montgomery vs. Gilmer, 33 Ala., 116, 70 Am.

Pleading, par. 28 1\/2.)<br\/><br\/>It will readily be seen that under these precedents, the charges of the complaint in the case at bar that the acts of defendant therein set forth were done in bad faith, or arbitrarily, or illegally or wrongfully, or maliciously, or without jurisdiction, or in violation of law, are mere legal conclusions, and, if not sustained by well-pleaded averments of facts, are not admitted by the demurrer and in no wise aid the complaint in setting forth a cause of action. And tho specific facts well-pleaded in the complaint, examined together with the court records incorporated therein, controverting, as we hold they do, each and all of these charges, there can be no question as to the correctness of the action of the court below in dismissing the complaint, even if counsel's own theory as to the liability of judicial officers in these Islands were admitted to be correct.<br\/><br\/>Let us examine the grounds alleged in the complaint upon which plaintiff's counsel rest their charges of bad faith, keeping in mind the general rule that \"the pleader is bound by, and estopped to controvert, allegations or admissions in his own pleadings.\" (39 Cent. Digest, tit. Pleading, par. 81, 82.)<br\/><br\/>As we understand the argument of counsel he contends that the bad faith of defendant is disclosed by his alleged wrongful acts in connection with the disposition by this court of the appeals in the two cases described in the complaint, whereby, as it is alleged, he induced this court to render the alleged erroneous judgment which occasioned the alleged damages as set forth in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>Manifestly the very backbone of this contention is broken by our finding that the judgment in question was not erroneous. That finding, not only disposes of plaintiff's allegations that she suffered damages, as we undertook to show in the earlier portion of this opinion; it goes also to the very foundation of her contention that defendant was acting in bad faith in urging upon the court, as it is alleged he did, that the judgment in question should be entered.<br\/><br\/>Of course an unjust judge may render a just judgment in a particular case, and the mere fact that he has done so does not establish a. claim on his behalf that he has on all occasions borne himself as a just and righteous judge. But it is difficult, if not impossible to conceive a case wherein a court would be justified in holding that a judge who had entered a just and righteous judgment, in the performance of his duties as a judge in <i>a particular case<\/i>, did so in bad faith, or that he was actuated by any other than lawful motives in adjudicating <i>the particular case<\/i> in which this just and righteous judgment was rendered.<br\/><br\/>But even if it were admitted that the judgment as rendered by this court was in fact an erroneous judgment, or that this court erred when it directed its entry, and errs now in its interpretation and application of the facts developed in the cases incorporated into the complaint, we hold, nevertheless, that the charge of bad faith or of lack of good faith could not be sustained by proof of that fact, taken together with proof of the other facts well pleaded in the complaint. By the unanimous vote of those taking part in the adjudication of the two separate appeals mentioned in the complaint this court has heretofore construed the facts disclosed by the records in those cases, and interpreted the law applicable thereto, against the contentions of the plaintiff. Upon a full review of the facts and the law as developed in the records of these cases, after listening to several days' oral argument by counsel and upon a careful study of the printed briefs, we unanimously adhere to our former findings. If we are correct in our conclusions, the defendant correctly voted for, and recommended the entry of the judgments in question. If we are in error, the defendant erred also, in the part he took in the adjudication of those cases. But it is very clear that such an error on his part, granting that it was committed, would furnish no support whatever to a charge of bad faith; so that the charge of bad faith set out in the complaint, if sustained at all, must rest on the other allegations of fact well pleaded therein.<br\/><br\/>The complaint in express terms alleges that an \"inspection\" of the written opinions of this court, prepared by the defendant in the two appealed cases referred to therein, discloses that defendant willfully perverted the facts developed by the records in those cases, and, with intent to deceive his associates, set forth in those opinions false statements of those facts, knowing them to be false. But a careful inspection and examination of the records of those cases clearly discloses that each and every material fact set forth in those opinions is in substantial accord with the facts developed by the records submitted to this court.<br\/><br\/>The alleged false statements of fact in the first opinion (cause No. 4017), as set forth in the complaint, are:<br\/><blockquote>\"(a) That said Solers were creditors, and preferred creditors of Martinez and Riu.<br\/><br\/>\"(b) That the judgment of the lower court dismissing the complaint, and dissolving the temporary injunction is hereby reversed, and the cause is remanded to the lower court with direction to take action not inconsistent herewith * * * without any finding of costs: defendant well knowing that such finding was a direct violation of said decision of March 27.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>But we have shown already that the record, and the agreed statement of facts submitted by counsel, clearly disclose that \"the said Solers were creditors and preferred creditors of Martinez and Riu;\" and not only does it affirmatively appear in the record of cause No. 4017 that the original decision and memorandum order of March 27 had been amended and in effect rescinded, at the time when the opinion in the later case was written, but that fact is expressly alleged in the complaint itself.<br\/><br\/>The alleged false statements of facts in the opinion in cause No. 5719, as set forth in the complaint, are:<br\/><blockquote>\"(a) That in the demand on the sheriff that he dismiss the levy in cause No. 3274, the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i> of said Solers alleges that their claim was a <i>preferred claim<\/i>; defendant well knowing from the record that in said demand they alleged under oath and claimed <i>as owners and partners<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"(b) That the Supreme Court had decided in cause No. 4017 <i>that the Solers had a credit preferred to that of the plaintiff Alzua against Martinez and Riu for P9,868.29<\/i>; defendant well knowing from the record that the decision in cause No. 4017 had not been pleaded or introduced in evidence in said cause 5719.<br\/><br\/>\"(c) That cause 5719 was brought against said Alzua and her bondsmen upon the bond executed and delivered by them to the sheriff, for the purpose of recovering the sum of P9,868.29, together with damages, interest, and costs amounting to P11,068.00; defendant well knowing from the record that the sheriff, the acting sheriff, Visitacion Martinez, and Joaquin Riu were also defendants in said cause, and that the only sum at issue was 9,868.29 pesos Mexican currency and that no damages had been proved.<br\/><br\/>\"(d) That said cause No. 5719 was instituted <i>on the first day of October, 1907, and after said decision of the Supreme Court dated September 14, 1907<\/i>; defendant well knowing from the record that said suit was instituted and filed <i>before said decision, to wit, on August 22, 1907<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"(e) That the record in cause No. 5719 shows that said indemnity bond to the sheriff was given after the issuance of the injunction by the lower court in cause No. 4017; defendant well knowing that the record in cause 5719 does not so show.<br\/><br\/>\"(f) That the defendants Garcia, Ruiz and Baylon as sureties, and Alzua as principal, had obligated themselves by said bond to <i>respond to the plaintiffs<\/i> (the said Solers) for the amount of the claim which said Solers had against the partnership of Martinez and Riu; defendant well knowing that said bond was given to the sheriff for his indemnity and that said Solers were not parties to said bond.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Referring to statement (a) it is sufficient to say that we have shown already, the record clearly discloses that while it is true that in his original demand on behalf of the minors, a claim on their behalf as owners and partners was set up by their guardian, nevertheless this claim was promptly abandoned, and before the property was sold and before the proceeds were distributed, their claim as \"<i>a preferred claim<\/i>\" was duly asserted, and the sheriff and his counsel duly advised thereof.<br\/><br\/>The matters discussed in statements (b) and (c) have already been disposed of, and we have shown that in regard thereto the contentions of counsel for Alzua as to the legal effect of the facts developed by the record are not well founded. So also as to statement (f) touching the legal effect of the execution of the indemnity bond, we have shown that the contention of counsel for Alzua is not well founded, and that the execution of that bond did, in fact, impose upon the indemnitor and her bondsmen an obligation to respond for the damages suffered by the minors as a result of the trespass of the sheriff.<br\/><br\/>As to the statements of facts referred to in paragraphs (d) and (e), it may be admitted that there is an apparent discrepancy between the date of the institution of cause No. 5719 as disclosed by the record and as set out in the opinion; and that the record does not conclusively support the statement, in the history of the case set out in the opinion, that the indemnity bond was executed after the issuance of the injunction in cause No. 4017. But on closer examination it will be found that these discrepancies are more apparent than real. The date mentioned in the history of the case set out in the opinion as the date of the institution of the action is October 1, 1907, but it appears that this is the date on which the amended complaint was filed, and that the original complaint in that action was filed on August 22, 1907; in the amended complaint new parties were brought into the action, and a new cause of action alleged, so that in one sense the action actually tried was commenced on the first day of October, 1907, the date mentioned in the opinion; but it is true that strictly and technically speaking the action was instituted on the 22d day of August, 1907, when the original complaint was filed. It also appears from the record that the indemnity bond was executed, and the injunction issued on the same day, October 14, 1907, but it does not expressly appear which was first in point of time; there is, however, some ground for the inference that the bond was given after the issuance of the injunction, as set out in the opinion. But it is very apparent that these minor discrepancies, if they can properly be said to be discrepancies, are of no possible import. The institution of cause No. 5719 a few weeks earlier or later than the date set out in the opinion, and the filing of the indemnity bond a few hours before rather than after the issuance of the injunction in case No. 4017, could have no possible effect upon the judgment to be rendered in cause No. 5719. These slight inaccuracies in the statement of the history of the case, if they can properly be called inaccuracies, could not have affected the reasoning of the court in arriving at its conclusions, whether it proceeded on the theory of the case as relied upon by the plaintiffs therein or upon that urged by the defendants. Manifestly, no charge of bad faith, or of willful wrongdoing can be predicated upon these alleged inaccuracies in the relation of wholly immaterial matter in the history of the case as given in the course of the opinion, since they could in no wise have affected the judgment of the court, or the reasoning of the members of the court upon which that judgment was based.<br\/><br\/>The result then of our inspection of the opinions together with the records in the cases in question is to find that the allegations of the complaint that the defendant willfully perverted and misrepresented the facts developed in those records, and made false statements of the facts, knowing them to be false, are not well founded; and that the statements of all the material facts contained in the opinions in those cases are substantially correct and in substantial accord with the records of the cases wherein those opinions were entered. It clearly results that the charges of bad faith, of intent to injure the plaintiff Alzua, of wrongful intervention in the adjudication of those cases, and of official misconduct in the performance of the duties of the defendant as a member of this court are not sustained by the allegations touching the preparation of the opinions in those cases by the defendant, and on the contrary, are directly controverted by the facts well pleaded in the complaint and disclosed by an inspection and review of the records themselves.<br\/><br\/>Before passing to the last and only remaining allegation in the complaint, upon which counsel appear to rely in support of the charge of bad faith, we will glance for a moment at the allegations touching the connection of Justice Elliott with the case. This allegation evidently has its foundation in the fact that Justice Elliott's name is not attached to the opinion. We are utterly unable to discover how, upon the facts of this case, the mere fact that the opinion does not bear his signature (or that it was not presented to him for signature for some reason not alleged in the complaint) could even remotely tend to support a charge of bad faith on the part of the defendant. But since the pleader saw fit to allege this fact, and presumably had some purpose in doing so, we call attention to some facts of general knowledge in the courts of these Islands, which to our minds demonstrate that no inference of bad faith on the part of the defendant would be supported by proof of the allegations that the opinion was not presented to Justice Elliott for his signature and that he took no part in the disposition of the case. Justice Elliott was at the time when the decision was filed the most recent addition to the court. He was not present at the date alleged in the complaint when the first case mentioned therein was before the court, and could not, therefore, have taken part in any of the earlier discussions of the questions raised in the extended course of this litigation. Within less than thirty days from the filing of the opinion he resigned from the court to accept an appointment in the executive branch of the Philippine Government. And finally, of the nine opinions of this court published in volume 14 of the Philippine Reports bearing date from the 7th day of January, 1910, to the 14th day of January, 1910 (the week immediately preceding the 15th day of January, 1910, on which the opinion in question was published), only one (the first) bears the signature of Justice Elliott. Manifestly, whatever were the reasons for Justice Elliott's abstention from participation in the adjudication of those cases (and we doubt not that there were sufficient reasons), no inference of bad faith on the part of the defendant could be sustained by proof of the bare allegations of the complaint touching his abstention from participation in the adjudication of this case.<br\/><br\/>The charge of bad faith, in so far as it is based on the allegations of the complaint touching the defendant's action in provisionally suspending the execution of the original memorandum order directing the entry of judgment in case No. 4017 has already been shown to be baseless. We have shown that it would have been the duty and the province of the court itself, if in session, to amend that order if it appeared to have been erroneously entered. We have shown that this original order, affirming instead of revoking the judgment of the court below, was undoubtedly erroneous. We have shown that the defendant, at the time when he did the acts complained of in this connection, was on duty as the vacation justice of the court, and as such was charged with the duty of securing an opportunity to the court to make the necessary amendment in the erroneous order. We have shown that for this purpose he was clothed with the necessary interlocutory jurisdiction. It is very clear, therefore, that no charge of bad faith can be successfully predicated on proof that the defendant did his duty in the premises, and exercised his interlocutory jurisdiction over the case then pending before the court, to prevent a grave miscarriage of justice, and to secure to the court an opportunity, of which it later availed itself, to enter a final judgment in accordance with the very right of the cause.<br\/><br\/>But the absolute baselessness of the whole fabric of innuendo, insinuation, denunciation, and specific charges of wrongdoing in this connection, on which the plaintiff seeks to make a showing in the complaint of bad faith on the part of the defendant, will become still more apparent by contrasting the allegations of the complaint with the simple facts as developed by an inspection of the record.<br\/><br\/>With evident intent to lend a sinister aspect to defendant's conduct in this connection, and thus make a showing of bad faith on the face of the complaint, it is alleged that defendant acted surreptitiously, and \"without consulting the other justices of the court;\" and in their argument upon the demurrer, counsel boldly asserted that his action in this regard amounted to a falsification of a public record, one of the gravest crimes defined and penalized in the Spanish criminal code.<br\/><br\/>Let us see what the allegations of the complaint read together with the record actually disclose. On the 27th of March, 1907, the last day of the sessions of this court prior to the court vacations of that year a \"short decision\" or more accurately speaking a \"memorandum order,\" in Spanish, was erroneously entered in the case hereinbefore described as case No; 4017, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Reserving the right to set forth hereafter the grounds of this decision, the judgment of the court below is hereby affirmed in all respects, with the costs of this instance against the appellants. And after the expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in accordance herewith, and ten days thereafter let the record be returned to the court whence it came for execution. It is so ordered.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Notice of this erroneous order was sent to counsel on the 30th of March. On or about the 8th of April, <i>and before judgment had been entered<\/i>, the defendant, at that time acting as vacation justice of this court, and clothed with the jurisdiction and authority conferred by law on such officers, provisionally amended this \"memorandum order\" by striking out the word \"<i>confirmamos<\/i>\" (\"we affirm\") and substituting therefor the word \"<i>revocamos<\/i>\" (\"we reverse\"), at the same time entering in the margin of the order, in parenthesis, his initials \"E. F. J.\" (E. Finley Johnson), indicating thereby that the amendment had been made by him. Two days thereafter formal and official notice of the change was served on counsel; and, on the morning of the very day when the amendment was made, counsel for Alzua and the sheriff were personally advised of the fact that the provisional amendment had been or was about to be made, as clearly and conclusively appears from the fact disclosed by the record, that at 11.55 a. m., of April 8, 1907, the firm of Hartigan, Rhode &amp; Gutierrez, counsel for Alzua and the sheriff, filed in the clerk's office a motion for a rehearing, At the same time that the provisional amendment of the memorandum order was made by the defendant, he issued orders to the clerk that neither the original order nor the amended order should be executed until the further order of the court. Nothing further was done until the court reassembled, after vacation, in July, when the defendant reported what had been done, and the court, after due consideration, affirmed and ratified his action, as appears from the following order, duly entered on the minutes on the 25th day of July.<br\/><blockquote>\"Report having been submitted of the petition submitted by Messrs. Hartigan, Rohde &amp; Gutierrez, in case No. 3132, Manuel Soler y Martinez et al. vs. Emilia Alzua et al.t injunction proceedings, moving the court for a rehearing, on the ground that the facts disclosed by the record do not sustain the judgment thereon, the court being duly informed thereof, resolved that the petition be denied. <i>And Justice Johnson having informed the court that in entering the decision in this matter an involuntary error had been committed, by inserting therein the word 'confirmamos' (we affirm), in place of the word 'revocamos' (we reverse), it was ordered that the amendment inserted therein be held to be ratified and affirmed<\/i>.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It would not be easy to indicate a more open, public, and direct procedure whereby defendant could have secured the temporary suspension of the execution of the erroneous order pending the action of the full court, than that actually adopted by him. Of course the record does not disclose that he formally and officially consulted with his associates in this matter until they had returned from vacation and assembled in regular session. At the time when the amendment was made they were all absent on vacation, and as we have shown, it was his sworn duty to act for and on behalf of the court, on his own responsibility, if he was convinced that the memorandum order was erroneously entered, and that it should be suspended until the full court had an opportunity to take the proper final action in regard thereto. It affirmatively appearing not only that every act done by the defendant in this connection was done with due notice, both official and personal, to counsel for all the parties in interest, with due notice to the court itself, with a full record thereof spread upon the court files, and with the knowledge and intervention of the clerk of the court, and it also appearing that the counsel, the parties, the court itself and the clerk were all advised and informed of his action by the defendant at the very earliest available opportunity; it is very clear that the surmises, conjectures and specific charges of bad faith which are set out in the complaint must fall to the ground so far as they are based on the alleged surreptitious manner in which the temporary suspension of the execution of the memorandum order was secured by the defendant. We are not now considering whether it might not have been more expedient, or more technically correct in form, had the defendant issued a formal order amending the original order and directing the suspension of the execution of both the original and the amended order pending the action of the court in session, rather than to have adopted the course which he actually pursued. This question can have no possible bearing on the issue involved herein. We are examining the course he actually pursued, to ascertain whether his action, viewed from the standpoint of the actuating motive therefor, the legal effects flowing therefrom, and the manner in which he did the acts which the record discloses he did in this connection, justify the charges of bad faith set forth in the complaint; and we conclude, that not only are these charges not sustained, but that they are directly controverted by the material and relevant facts disclosed by an inspection of the complaint itself, together with the exhibits and court records incorporated therein.<br\/><br\/>The argument might be extended further, but it would seem to be unnecessary. Enough has been said, we think, to show that even upon the plaintiff's own theory of the law in force in these Islands as to the civil liability of judicial officers for acts done in the exercise of their judicial functions, the complaint fails to set forth sufficient well-pleaded material, and relevant facts to sustain a cause of action against the defendant.<br\/><br\/><center> CONCLUSION.<br\/><\/center> <br\/>In the course of his oral argument, senior counsel for the plaintiffs formally requested this court, whatever action it might take on his appeal, to set out in its opinion a plain statement of the facts connected with the litigation under review in this action, as those facts are known to the court. As we understood him, however, later on in the discussion and in colloquy with counsel for appellee, he withdrew, or rather undertook to qualify this request by limiting the scope of the statement to the facts which he himself had set out in the complaint. Having in mind the form in which this appeal was finally submitted to us, we have conceived it to be our duty to exercise the most scrupulous care to exclude from this opinion, and from the reasoning upon which we base our judgment herein, any fact not disclosed by the complaint and the records referred to therein, or of which the court below might not and should not have taken judicial notice. But under all the circumstances, we think it not improper for us to say that it is for this reason and this reason alone that we have not complied with the request of counsel, further than to include his complaint as a marginal note attached to this opinion; and to add, each member whose signature is hereto attached speaking for himself, that had we felt at liberty to set forth the facts as originally requested by counsel, no fact known to this court or to any of its members would in any wise tend to weaken the force of the conclusions herein set out, or to detract from the force of the reasoning upon which these conclusions rest.<br\/><br\/>In this connection, however, some general observations as to the practice and procedure of this court in preparing its opinions and filing its decisions may not be out of place, and will shed some light upon, our interpretation and treatment of some of the incidents set forth in the complaint, and of the contentions of counsel in relation thereto. These observations, while not restricted to the facts alleged in the complaint, will be strictly limited to matters of general knowledge in the courts of these Islands, and disclosed by public court records and the official reports of the Attorney-General.<br\/><br\/>The Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands annually disposes of some eight hundred cases, about equally divided between the civil and the criminal dockets, in some five hundred of which written opinions are filed. In addition, an exceptionally large number of motions and incidental matters are disposed of in minute orders; the exceptionally large number of matters of this nature being due, in part at least, to the adoption in this jurisdiction of an American procedural system, without any substantial modification of the substantive law of the Islands as found in the codes of Spain. It is believed that a comparison of these figures with those of the half-hundred courts of last resort in the United States will disclose that the volume of the output of this court, as a whole and per capital of its membership, places it well within the rank of the first half dozen of those courts in this regard. (See the reporters generally and data assembled by the West Publishing Company and published in the Docket.)<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, it is to be remembered that in disposing of this large volume of business, this court, unlike the appellate courts of the United States generally, is required, in all criminal cases and in ninety per cent of the civil cases, to review the evidence (which is not required by law to be printed and comes up in the original transcript of the stenographer's notes) so as to ascertain whether the judgment of the lower courts are \"sustained by the weight of the evidence.\" This as a consequence of the absence of the jury system in the Philippines. Then, too, an unusual number of difficult and doubtful questions present themselves in this jurisdiction, arising out of the conflict of laws resulting from the introduction of new laws and new institutions under American sovereignty, which must be interpreted and construed with due regard to the jurisprudence of both the old and the new sovereign. And finally, the mere mechanical difficulties, and in some cases the delays, involved in the preparation, submission, discussion and publication of the decisions of the court are notably increased by the fact that the official language of the courts in the Philippines is Spanish, while four of the members of this court are Americans, whose knowledge of that language has for the most part been acquired since coming to the Islands.<br\/><br\/>As might be expected, under such conditions, it has not infrequently become necessary for the court, especially as to cases decided just before adjournment for its annual vacation, to content itself with announcing its judgments in short \"memorandum\" decisions, definitely adjudicating the rights of the parties to the litigation without setting out the reasoning and authority upon which such judgments are based. In such cases the court usually reserves the right to prepare and publish extended opinions at a later day, if the publication of such extended opinions appears to be expedient or necessary. The purpose and object of this practice is, of course, to avoid unnecessary and useless delay in the administration of justice. So far as the litigants in a particular case are concerned, it is the judgment of the court, not the reasons on which the judgment is based, with which they are chiefly concerned. And it is believed that the interests of both the litigants and the public are best subserved in these cases by the prompt adjudication of the issues involved in a memorandum opinion, and the publication, at a later day, of a carefully prepared opinion, setting out the reasoning and authority therefor. (Cf. Ocampo vs. Caba\u00f1gis, 15 Phil. Rep., 626.)<br\/><br\/>Another consequence of the mechanical difficulties involved in the preparation of the opinions, orders, and judgments of the court in two languages, and of the necessity for the translation of those prepared in English into the official language, before being submitted for signature, is that \"eternal vigilance\" on the part of each member of the court, is the price which must be paid to avoid the clerical errors, mistakes, and misunderstandings which otherwise would so readily creep into the proceedings; and under the circumstances, no one doubts the right of this court, under the liberal doctrine of the American courts, to amend and correct clerical errors in the records of its proceedings, when such amendments or corrections are necessary to make these records speak the truth. In practice such amendments and corrections are and always have been very freely made.<br\/><br\/>The memorandum order which was provisionally amended by the defendant was filed on the day immediately preceding the adjournment for the court vacation in the year 1907. Counsel for defendant insists that the provisional amendment was merely an attempt to correct a purely involuntary clerical error, which had crept into the judgment in the haste of the adjournment proceedings. In support of his contention he refers to the above set out minute order dated July 28, 1907, wherein the court expressly declared that the word \"confirmamos\" (affirm) was \"involuntarily\" inserted instead of the word \"revocamos\" (reverse) in the original memorandum order. Of course the right and the duty of the defendant and of the court itself to correct an \"involuntary\" clerical error could not and would not be questioned under the circumstances. But we have not in any wise rested our decision on this contention, because while it is true that this court solemnly declared in the minute order that the amendment ratified by it was made to correct an \"involuntary\" error of this nature, we do not understand that the plaintiff, by incorporating the record of those proceedings into his complaint, formally admits that it was in fact so made. As we understand the admissions of the complaint, they only go to the verity of the facts disclosed by the records incorporated therein, and not to the truth or accuracy of the reasons assigned for the entry of the orders, judgments and decrees contained in these records. Accordingly we have wholly disregarded this contention of counsel for the defendant, and we have based our conclusions on the broader ground of the right of the court to correct and amend errors of law or of fact in its orders and judgments, before such erroneous judgments and orders become final.<br\/><br\/>We here refer to this contention of counsel for defendant, merely in explanation of our action in this regard, and to avoid the possibility that our silence on this point might be construed as in some sort a recognition of the truth of plaintiffs' allegations that the original memorandum order confirming the judgment of the court below was in fact entered in accord with the original vote and action of the court, and not as contended by counsel for defendant, through an involuntary clerical mistake.<br\/><br\/>Senior counsel for plaintiffs having agreed in open court with counsel for defendant on the submission of the case on appeal that if the complaint as submitted is subject to demurrer, it can not be amended so as to set forth a cause of action, and that fact appearing on its face: the judgment of the court below, sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the complaint without day, should be affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/>So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Philippine Islands. In the Court of<br\/><br\/><center> First Instance of Manila.<br\/><br\/>No. 8769.<br\/><br\/>Emilia Alzua and Ignacio Arnalot vs. E. F. Johnson.<br\/><br\/>[Plaintiffs' translation of the complaint, filed with the brief.]<br\/><\/center> <br\/>Now come the plaintiffs and for cause of action against the defendant, allege:<br\/><br\/>1. That the plaintiffs are husband and wife and residents of Manila; that the defendant is a resident of Manila, and at all times herein mentioned was a justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>2. That on September 7, 1905, the plaintiff Alzua obtained judgment in cause No. 3274 in the Court of First Instance of Manila against Visitacion Martinez y Moreno, widow of Soler, and Joaquin Riu y Planas, in the sum of P14,100, which judgment was therein declared to be a first lien upon all the business of said Martinez and Riu in the Philippine Islands, and especially upon \"The Sport\" and \"The Jockey,\" two stores in Manila owned and operated by said Martinez and Riu; all of which more specifically appears from the appended copy of said judgment marked \"Exhibit A,\" which is made a part of this complaint. That by a stipulation signed by all the parties on September 22, 1905, the amount of this judgment was changed to P12,700 with interest and costs.<br\/><br\/>3. That thereafter execution was issued on said judgment and placed in the hands of the sheriff of Manila, who in pursuance thereto on or about October 13, 1905, levied upon the merchandise constituting the stock of The Sport aforesaid.<br\/><br\/>4. That thereafter and on said October 13, 1905, Manuel and Federico Soler, sons of said Martinez, pursuant to section 451 of the Code of Civil Procedure, made demand on said sheriff that he dismiss said levy <i>and deliver the property to the said Solers<\/i>, alleging under oath that they were <i>the owners as partners of the entire stock of The Sport<\/i> so levied on, <i>and as partners were entitled to the absolute and complete possession thereof<\/i>; that in said demand the said Solers do not allege or claim to be creditors, preferred or otherwise, of The Sport, or of said Martinez and Riu; all of which more specifically appears from the appended copy of said sworn claim marked \"Exhibit B,\" which is made a part of this complaint.<br\/><br\/>5. That thereafter and on October 14, 1905, upon demand of the sheriff under said section 451 <i>for a bond of indemnity against the claim of the said Solers as owners and partners<\/i>, the plaintiff Alzua <i>executed and delivered a bond to the sheriff, which bond was duly accepted by the sheriff as such indemnity<\/i>; all of which more specifically appears from the appended copy of said indemnity bond marked \"Exhibit C\" which is made a part of this complaint. Thereupon the sheriff refused to release said levy in compliance with the demand of said Solers, pursuant to said section 451, and proceeded to advertise and sell The Sport to satisfy the judgment in cause No. 3274.<br\/><br\/>6. That thereupon and on said October 14, 1905, Manuel and Federico Soler brought suit No. 4017 in the Court of First Instance of Manila against said sheriff and said Alzua, alleging as before that said Solers were <i>owners as partners of The Sport and therefore entitled to the possession thereof<\/i>, and praying:<br\/><br\/>(a) That said sheriff and said Alzua be enjoined from making levy thereon and from continuing the levy already made.<br\/><br\/>(b) Judgment for damages in the sum of P600 against said sheriff and said Alzua <i>for interfering with said owners in the possession of eaid store<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>(c) Costs,<br\/><br\/>7. That thereafter and on November 20, 1905, the said court rendered decision in favor of said sheriff and said Alzua, and dismissed cause No. 4017; whereupon said Solers appealed from this decision to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>8. That thereafter and on March 27, 1907, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in cause No. 4017, signed by the Honorable Chief Justice, and Justices Torres, Mapa, Tracey, and the defendant Justice Johnson, as follows:<br\/><blockquote><i>Decision<\/i>,\u2014\"Without prejudice to stating later on the grounds of this decision, the judgment of the court below is hereby affirmed in all respects, with the costs of this instance against the appellants. And after the expiration of twenty days let judgment be entered in. accordance herewith, and ten days thereafter the record will be returned to the court whence it came for execution. It is so ordered.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>That said decision was prepared by some justice to the plaintiff unknown, but plaintiffs are informed and believe, and therefore allege, that it was not prepared by defendant; that on March 30, 1907 [1909], notice of said decision was duly sent to and received by the several parties to said cause, of the following tenor:<br\/><blockquote>\"You are hereby notified that on the 27th of March 1907, a decision rendered by this court in the above-entitled cause was filed in this office, whereby the judgment of the lower court is affirmed in all its parts, with costs against the appellants; and after twenty days judgment will be entered according to the tenor of the decision, and ten days thereafter the record will be returned to the court of its origin, to be proceeded with according to law. The notice dated March 30 is hereby annulled.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>That thereafter and on March 31, the term of the Supreme Court closed and the court adjourned for vacation, and held no session between March 27, when said decision was rendered, and July 1, 1907.<br\/><br\/>9. That on or about April 8, 1907, after the close of the term in which said decision was rendered and while said court stood adjourned the defendant, without consulting the other justices of said court, struck out with pen and ink upon the official records in said decision the word \"affirmed,\" and wrote in place thereof the word \"reversed;\" that on April 10, 1907, notice of the following tenor was sent to and received by the several parties to said cause:<br\/><blockquote>\"You are hereby notified that on the 27th of March, 1907, a decision rendered by this court in the above-entitled cause was tiled in this office, whereby the judgment of the lower court is <i>reversed<\/i> in all its parts, with costs against the appellants; and after twenty days judgment will be entered according to the tenor of the decision, and ten days thereafter the record will be returned to the court of its origin, to be proceeded with according to law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>That thereafter and while said court stood adjourned, defendantpersonally directed the clerk not to enter judgment or to return the record to the lower court for execution, and by reason of such direction the clerk did not enter judgment nor return the record as ordered in said decision [of March 27;] that judgment was not entered nor was the record returned to the court below until about July 29, 1907, and the judgment then returned was in accordance with the text of the decision as changed by defendant <i>reversing<\/i> instead of <i>affirming<\/i> the judgment of the court below.<br\/><br\/>That by the above acts defendant attempted to reverse the judgment and to defeat the mandate of the Supreme Court, and in effect did reverse said judgment and defeat said mandate; that defendant had neither legal right nor authority to perform said acts, and performed the same wrongfully and with intent to injure the plaintiff Alzua.<br\/><br\/>10. That having performed the acts above stated, defendant prepared another document purporting to be a different decision of cause No. 4017, which purported decision was thereafter signed by five justices of said court including the defendant, and filed in said cause on September 14, 1907; all of which more specifically appears from the appended copy of said purported decision marked \"Exhibit D,\" which is made a part of this complaint. That in said purported decision defendant wrongfully and with intent to injure the said Alzua, set forth the following false statements of fact:<br\/><blockquote>\"(a) That said Solers were <i>creditors<\/i> and <i>preferred creditors<\/i> of Martinez and Riu; defendant well knowing from the record:<br\/><br\/>\"(1) That said Solers alleged that they were <i>owners as partners<\/i> of The Sport, and as such were <i>entitled to possession of said property and to damages for the interruption of said possession<\/i> by the levy in cause No. 3274 to which they were not parties.<br\/><br\/>\"(2) That they did not allege to be <i>creditors, preferred or otherwise<\/i>, or entitled to be paid out of the funds received from said levy and sale.<br\/><br\/>\"(3) That Martinez and Riu were not parties to cause No. 4017, and could not be bound by the decision in said cause.<br\/><br\/>\"(b) That the judgment of the lower court dismissing the complaint and dissolving the temporary injunction <i>is hereby reversed<\/i>, and the cause is remanded to the lower court <i>with direction to take action not inconsistent herewith<\/i>, * * * <i>without any finding as to costs<\/i>; defendant well knowing that such finding was a direct violation of said decision of March 27.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>11. That no final decision or judgment has been rendered in cause No. 4017; and that said cause has been dormant in the Court of First Instance since its return from the Supreme Court, and the same is now pending and undisposed of in said court.<br\/><br\/>12. That on August 22, 1907, and prior to the purported decision of September 14, said Manuel and Federico Soler brought suit No. 5719 in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the sheriff, the acting sheriff, and Emilia Alzua, her husband Ignacio Arnalot, Juan Garcia, Juan Gonzalez Ruiz, and Celedbnia Baylon (the five last named being indemnitors on the bond given to the sheriff as set forth in par. 6) to which suit Visitacion Martinez and Joaquin Riu were made parties before the trial thereof, alleging for the time that the Solers had a preferred credit of 9,868.29 pesos Mex. (of the market value of P10,016.31 P. C.) in the capital which Martinez and Riu had invested in The Sport, and praying judgment against all the above defendants.<br\/><br\/>13. That thereafter and on November 19, 1907, the Court of First Instance rendered its decision dismissing the action as to all the defendants except said Martinez, who had by formal answer confessed her liability, and giving judgment <i>solely against said Martinez in the sum of P10,016.31 with interest thereon from August 22, 1907<\/i>; all of which more specifically appears from the appended copy of said decision marked \"Exhibit E,\" which is made a part of this complaint.<br\/><br\/>14. That thereafter said Solers appealed from this decision to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, and said cause was set for hearing on ............................................, 1909. That there were present and sitting in said court the Honorable Chief Justice and Justices Torres, Carson, Moreland, Elliott, and the defendant; that none of the parties appeared at said hearing and the case was submitted without argument.<br\/><br\/>15. That thereafter, without having discussed or consulted with the justices to whom the cause was submitted as aforesaid regarding the decision thereof, defendant prepared a decision, a copy of which is hereto appended marked \"Exhibit F,\" and made a part of this complaint; that therein defendant wrongfully and with intent to injure .the plaintiff Alzua, set forth the following false statements of fact:<br\/><blockquote>\"(a) That in the demand on the sheriff that he dismiss the levy in cause No. 3274, the guardian ad litem of said Solers alleges that their claim was a <i>preferred claim<\/i>; defendant well knowing from the record that in said demand they alleged under oath and claimed as owners and partners.<br\/><br\/>\"(b) That the Supreme Court had decided in cause No. 4017 <i>that the Solers had a credit preferred to that of the plaintiff Alzua against Martinez and Riu for P9,868.29<\/i>; defendant well knowing from the record that the decision in cause No. 4017 had not been pleaded or introduced in evidence in said cause 5719.<br\/><br\/>\"(c) That cause 5719 was brought against said Alzua and her bondsmen upon the bond executed and delivered by them to the sheriff, for the purpose of recovering the sum of P9,868.29, together with damages, interest, and costs amounting to P11,068; defendant well knowing from the record that the sheriff, the acting sheriff, Visitacion Martinez, and Joaquin Riu were also defendants in said cause, and that the only sum at issue was 9,868.29 pesos Mexican currency, and that no damages had been proved.<br\/><br\/>\"(d) That said cause No. 5719 was instituted <i>on the first day of October, 1907, and after said decision of the Supreme Court dated September 14, 1907<\/i>; defendant well knowing from the record that said suit was instituted and filed <i>before said decision, to wit, on August 22, 1907<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"(e) That the record in cause No. 5719 shows that said indemnity bond to the sheriff was given <i>after<\/i> the issuance of the injunction by the lower court in cause No. 4017; defendant well knowing that the record in cause 5719 does not so show.<br\/><br\/>\"(f) That the defendants Garcia, Ruiz and Baylon as sureties, and Alzua as principal, had obligated themselves by said bond to <i>respond to the plaintiffs<\/i> (the said Solers) for the amount of the claim which said Solers had against the partnership of Martinez and Riu; defendant well knowing that said bond was given to the sheriff for his indemnity, and that said Solers were not parties to said bond.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>16. That defendant wrongfully and with intent to injure the plaintiff Alzua, neglected to discuss or consider the actual questions involved in cause No. 5719 or the evidence relating thereto, and perverted and misrepresented the facts as aforesaid; that having prepared and signed this decision, defendant obtained the signatures of the Honorable Chief Justice and Justices Torres, Carson, and Moreland, upon defendant's representation that the facts therein stated were true, and that a fair and impartial statement of the case was therein set forth; defendant well knowing that said representation was not true. Plaintiffs further allege that said decision was never presented to or signed by Justice Elliott, who was present and sitting at the hearing of said cause, and he was not in any manner informed of the same.<br\/><br\/>17. That defendant omitted the names of Martinez and Riu from the caption of said decision, and thereafter personally directed the clerk of the Supreme Court to enter judgment solely against Alzua, Garcia, Ruiz, and Baylon, and not to include Martinez and Riu in said judgment; [defendant well knowing that Martinez and Riu were defendants of record, and that the lower court had rendered judgment against one of them, to wit, the said Martinez. That defendant had neither legal right nor authority to perform the above acts], and performed them wrongfully and with intent to injure the said Alzua.<br\/><br\/>18. That thereafter, and on February 8, 1910, pursuant to this decision and the personal direction of defendant, judgment was entered against Alzua, Garcia, Ruiz, and Baylon for the sum of P11,068 with interest thereon from October 14, 1905; all of which more specifically appears in the appended copy of said judgment marked \"Exhibit C,\" which is made a part of this complaint.<br\/><br\/>19, That by this decision prepared by defendant and the judgment entered pursuant to his instructions, the decision of the lower court was wholly reversed even as to said Martinez, who had confessed her liability; and Alzua and the other indemnitors to the sheriff were held liable to said Solers, for the alleged reason that the said Solers were creditors of Martinez and Riu, and <i>preferred<\/i> to said Alzua; that although Martinez and Riu were never sued by said Solers to establish said liability except in cause No. 5719, by said decision and judgment Martinez and Riu were absolved from the liability claim by said Solers, and the pretended liability of Martinez and Riu is used only as a specious basis for rendering judgment against the indemnitors to the sheriff.<br\/><br\/>20. That defendant performed each and every act hereinbefore alleged in relation to causes Nos. 4017 and 5719 wrongfully and with intent to injure the plaintiff Alzua, and with full knowledge of the facts herein set forth. Plaintiffs further allege that such knowledge appears from an inspection of the decisions in causes Nos. 4017 and 5719.<br\/><br\/>21. That upon execution issued, plaintiffs in this action paid the judgment of P12,000 in cause No. 5719 about March 1, 1910; that in order to satisfy this judgment they were compelled to sell at great sacrifice all the property they had, consisting of an interest in the Hotel Francia located on Plaza Goiti in Manila, of the actual value of P40,000; that since March 1, 1910, the profits from the interest then sold have amounted to P25,000.<br\/><br\/>22. That by reason of the acts of defendant hereinbefore set forth, plaintiffs have been deprived of their property without due process of law and for no lawful reason whatsoever, in violation of section 5 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, known as The Philippine Bill, and of the fifth amendment to the Constitution of the United States; that they have suffered actual damages to the amount of P40,000, the value of said property, and special damages to the amount of P26,000 which they would have realized as income from said property; and that they are entitled to punitive damages in the sum of P60,000 by reason of the aforesaid acts of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Wherefore plaintiffs pray judgment against defendant as follows: For actual and special damages in the sum of P65,000; for punitive damages in the sum of P50,000; for the costs of this action; and for such further relief as may be just.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">EMILIA ALZUA<br\/>Y.

In making his recommendation the Chief Justice shall select the five judges with a view to the convenient exercise of interlocutory jurisdiction by each of the judges selected in two neighboring districts, so that for interlocutory purposes there may be a judge available in every three districts. The Civil Governor shall, on or before the first of January of each year, issue an executive order naming the judges of the Supreme Court and of all Courts of First Instance who shall remain on duty, subject to call for the purposes of interlocutory jurisdiction, throughout the Islands. In this executive order the Governor shall assign to the regular judges of the Courts of First Instance the districts over which, in addition to their own districts, they shall during vacation exercise interlocutory jurisdiction.

The necessary result of the liability would be to occupy the judge's time and mind with the defense of his own interests, when he should be giving them up wholly to his public duties, thereby defeating, to some extent, the very purpose for which his office was created.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The effect of putting the judge on his defense as a wrongdoer necessarily is to lower the estimation in which his office is held by the public, and any adjudication against him lessens the weight of his subsequent decisions. This of itself is a serious evil, affecting the whole community; for the confidence and respect of the people for the government will always repose most securely on the judicial authority when it is esteemed, and must always be unstable and unreliable when this is not respected. If the judiciary is unjustly assailed in the public press, the wise judge refuses to put himself in position of defendant by responding, but he leaves the tempest to rage until an awakened public sentiment silences his detractors. But if he is forced upon his defense, as was well said in an early case, it 'would tend to the scandal and subversion of all justice, and those who are most sincere would not be free from continual calumniations.'<br\/><br\/>\"3. The civil responsibility of the judge would often be an incentive to dishonest instead of honest judgments, and would invite him to consult public opinion and public prejudices, when he ought to be wholly above and uninfluenced by them. As every suit against him would be to some extent an appeal to popular feeling, a judge, caring specially for his own protection, rather than for the cause of justice, could not well resist a leaning adverse to the parties against whom the popular passion or prejudice for the time being was running, and he would thus become a persecutor in the cases where he ought to be a protector, and might count with confidence on escaping responsibility in the very cases in which he ought to be punished. Of what avail, for example, could the civil liability of the judge have been to the victims of the brutality of Jeffreys if, while he was at the height of his power and influence and was wreaMng his brutal passions upon them amidst the applause of crowded court rooms, these victims had demanded redress against him at the hands of any other court and jury of the realm?<br\/><br\/>\"4. Such civil responsibility would constitute a serious obstruction to justice, in that it would render essential a large increase in the judicial force, not only as it would multiply litigation, but as it would open each case to endless controversy. This of itself would be an incalculable evil. The interest of the public in general rules and in settled order is vastly greater than in any results which only affect individuals; courts are for the general benefit rather than for the individual; and it is more important that their action shall tend to the peace and quiet of society than that, at the expense of order, and after many suits, they shall finally punish an officer with damages for his misconduct. And it is to be borne in mind that if one judge can be tried for his judgment, the one who presides on the trial may also be tried for his, and thus the process may go until it becomes intolerable.<br\/><br\/>\"5. But where the judge is really deserving of condemnation a prosecution at the instance of the State is a much more effectual method of bringing him to account than a private suit. A want of integrity, a failure to apply his judgment to the case before him, a reckless or malicious disposition to delay or defeat justice may exist and be perfectly capable of being shown, and yet not be made so apparent by the facts of any particular case that in a trial confined to those facts he would be condemned. It may require the facts of many cases to establish the fault; it may be necessary to show the official action for years. Where an officer is impeached, the whole official career is or may be gone into; in that case one delinquency after another is perhaps shown\u2014each tends to characterize the other, and the whole will enable the triers to form a just opinion of the official integrity. But in a private suit the party would be confined to the facts of his own case. It is against inflexible rules that one man should be allowed to base his recovery for his own benefit on a wrong done to another; and could it be permitted, the person first wronged, and whose right to redress would be as complete as any, would lose this advantage by the very fact that he stood first in the line of injured persons.<br\/><br\/>\"Whenever, therefore, the State confers judicial powers upon an individual, it confers them with full immunity from private suits. In effect, the State says to the officer that these duties are confined to his judgment; that he is to exercise his judgment fully, freely, and without favor, and he may exercise it without fear; that the duties concern individuals, but they concern more especially the welfare of the State and the peace and happiness of society; that if he shall fail in the faithful discharge of them he shall be called to account as a criminal; but that in order that he may not be annoyed, disturbed, and impeded in the performance of these high functions, a dissatisfied individual shall not be suffered to call in question his official action in a suit for damages. This is what the State, speaking by the mouth of the common law, says to the judicial officer.\" (Cooley on Torts, 2d ed., pp. 475-478.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Marginal note D:<br\/><br\/>Extract from opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, in Bradley vs. Fisher (80 U. S., 335):<br\/><blockquote>\"In other words, it sets up that the order for the entry of which the suit is brought was a judicial act, done by the defendant as the presiding justice of a court of general criminal jurisdiction. If such were the character of the act, and the jurisdiction of the court, the defendant cannot be subjected to responsibility for it in a civil action, however erroneous the act may have been, and however injurious in its consequences it may have proved to the plaintiff. For it is a general principle of the highest importance to the proper administration of justice that a judicial officer, in exercising the authority vested in him, shall be free to act upon his own convictions, without apprehension of personal consequence to himself. Liability to answer to every one who might feel himself aggrieved by the action of the judge, would be inconsistent with the possession of this freedom, and would destroy that independence without which no judiciary can be either respectable or useful. As observed by a distinguished English judge, it would establish the weakness of judicial authority in a degrading responsibility.<br\/><br\/>\"The principle, therefore, which exempts judges of courts of superior or general authority from liability in a civil action for acts done by them in the exercise of their judicial functions, obtains in all countries where there is any well-ordered system of jurisprudence. It has been the settled doctrine of the English courts for many centuries, and has never been denied, that we are aware of, in the courts of this country,<br\/><br\/>\"It has, as Chancellor Kent observes, 'a deep root in the common law.'<br\/><br\/>\"Nor can this exemption of the judges from civil liability be affected by the motives with which their judicial acts are performed. The purity of their motives cannot in this way be the subject of judicial inquiry. This was adjudged in the case of Floyd and Barker, reported by Coke, in 1608, where it was laid down that the judges of the realm could not be drawn in question for any supposed corruption impeaching the veracity of their records, except before the king himself, and it was observed that if they were required to answer otherwise, it would 'tend to the scandal and subversion of all justice, and those who are the most sincere, would not be free from continual calumniations.'<br\/><br\/>\"The truth of this latter observation is manifest to all persons having much experience with judicial proceedings in the superior courts. Controversies involving not merely great pecuniary interests, but the liberty and character of the parties and, consequently exciting the deepest feelings, are being constantly determined in those courts, in which there is a great conflict in the evidence and great doubt as to the law which should govern their decision. It is this class of cases which imposes upon the judge the severest labor, and often create in his mind a painful sense of responsibility. Yet it is precisely in this class of cases that the losing party feels most keenly the decision against him, and most readily accepts anything but the soundness of the decision in explanation of the action of the judge. Just in proportion to the strength of his convictions of the correctness of his own view of the case is he apt to complain of the judgment against him, and from complaints of the judgment to pass to the ascription of improper motives to the judge. When the controversy involves questions affecting large amounts of property or relates to a matter of general public concern, or touches the interests of numerous parties, the disappointment occasioned by an adverse decision, often finds vent in imputations of this character, and from the imperfection of human nature this is hardly a subject of wonder. If civil actions could be maintained in such cases against the judge, because the losing party should see fit to allege in his complaint that the acts of the judge were done with partiality, or maliciously, or corruptly, the protection essential to judicial independence would be entirely swept away. Few persons sufficiently irritated to institute an action against a judge for his judicial acts would hesitate to ascribe any character to the acts Which would be essential to the maintenance of the action.<br\/><br\/>\"If upon such allegations a judge could be compelled to answer in a civil action for his judicial acts, not only would his office be degraded and his usefulness destroyed, but he would be subjected for his protection to the necessity of preserving a complete record of all the evidence produced before him in every litigated case, and of the authorities cited and arguments presented, in order that he might be able to show to the judge before whom he might be summoned by the losing party\u2014and that judge perhaps one of an inferior jurisdiction\u2014that he had decided as he did with judicial integrity; and the second judge would be subjected to a similar burden, as he in his turn might also be held amenable by the losing party.<br\/><br\/>\"Some just observations on this head by the late Chief Justice Shaw, will be found in Pratt vs. Gardner, and the point here was adjudged in the recent case of Fray vs. Blackburn, by the Queen's Bench of England. One of the judges of that bench was sued for a judicial act, and on demurrer one of the objections taken to the declaration was, that it was bad in not alleging malice. Judgment on the demurrer having passed for the defendant, the plaintiff applied for leave to amend his declaration by introducing an allegation of malice and corruption; but Mr. Justice Compton replied: 'It is a principle of our law that no action will lie against a judge of one of the superior courts for a judicial act, though it be alleged to have been done maliciously and corruptly; therefore the proposed allegation would not make the declaration good. The public are deeply interested in this rule, which indeed exists for their benefit, and was established in order to secure the independence of the judges, and prevent them being harassed by vexatious actions;' and the leave was refused.<br\/><br\/>\"In this country the judges of the superior courts of record are only responsible to the people, or the authorities constituted by the people, from whom they receive their commissions, for the manner in which they discharge the great trusts of their office. If in the exercise of the powers with which they are clothed as ministers of justice, they act with partiality, or maliciously, or corruptly, or arbitrarily, or oppressively, they may be called to an account by impeachment and suspended or removed from office. In some States they may be thus suspended or removed without impeachment, by a vote of the two houses of the legislature.<br\/><br\/>\"The exemption of judges of the superior courts of record from liability to civil suit for their judicial acts existing when there is jurisdiction of the subject-matter, though irregularity and error attend the exercise of the jurisdiction, the exemption cannot be affected by any consideration of the motives with which the acts are done. The allegation of malicious or corrupt motives could always be made, and if the motives could be inquired into, judges would be subjected to the same vexatious litigation upon such allegations, whether the motives had or had not any real existence. Against the consequences of their erroneous or irregular action, from whatever motives proceeding, the law has provided for private parties numerous remedies, and to those remedies they must in such cases resort. But for malice or corruption in their action whilst exercising their judicial functions within the general scope of their jurisdiction, the judges of these courts can only be reached by public prosecution in the form of impeachment, or in such other form as may be specially prescribed.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> Marginal note F:<br\/><br\/>The provisions of Spanish law touching the civil liability of judicial officers are to be found in the <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i> (Code of Civil Procedure), book 2, Title VII, and the <i>Ley Organica del Poder Judicial<\/i> (Organic Law of the Judiciary), Title V, Chapter II.<br\/><br\/>Chapter II of Title V of the Organic Law is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 260.

The testator died on the 28th of September, 1909, a year and five months following the date of the execution of the will.  The will was propounded by the executrix, Juliana Bagtas, widow of the decedent, and the opponents are a son and several grandchildren by a former marriage, the latter being the children of a deceased daughter.<\/p>\n<p>The basis of the opposition to the probation of the will is that the same was not executed according to the formalities and requirements of the law touching wills, and further that the. testator was  not in the full enjoyment and use of his mental faculties and was without the  mental capacity necessary to execute a valid will.<\/p>\n<p>The record shows that the testator, Pioquinto Paguio, for some fourteen or fifteen years prior to the time of his death suffered from a paralysis of the left  side of his body; that a few years prior to his death his hearing became impaired and that he lost the power  of speech. Owing to the paralysis of certain muscles his  head fell to one side, and saliva ran from his mouth. He retained the use of his right hand, hdwever, and was able to write fairly well.  Through the medium of signs he was able to indicate his wishes to his wife and to other members of his family.<\/p>\n<p>At  the time of  the execution  of the will there were present the four testamentary witnesses, Agustin Paguio, Anacleto Paguio, Francisco Paguio,  and Pedro Paguio,  an attorney, Sefior  Marco, and one Florentino Ramos.  Anacleto Paguio and the attorney have  since died, and consequently their testimony was'not available upon the  trial of the case in the lower  court.  The other three testamentary witnesses and the witness Florentino Ramos testified as to the manner in which  the will was executed.  According to the uncontroverted testimony of these witnesses the will was executed in the following manner:<\/p>\n<p>Pioquinto Paguio, the testator, wrote out on pieces of paper  notes and items relating  to  the disposition of his property, and these notes were in turn delivered to Senor Marco, who transcribed them and put them  in form.  The witnesses testify that  the pieces of paper upon  which the notes were written were delivered to the attorney by the testator; that the attorney read them to the testator asking if they were his testamentary dispositions; that  the testator assented each time with an affirmative movement of his head; that after the will as a whole had  been  thus written by the attorney, it was read in a loud voice in the presence of the  testator and the witnesses; that Senor Marco gave the document to the testator; that the latter, after looking over it, signed it in the presence of the four subscribing witnesses; and  that  they in turn  signed it in the presence of the testator  and of each other.<\/p>\n<p>These  are the facts of record with reference to  the execution of the will and we are in perfect accord with the judgment  of the lower court that the formalities of the Code of Civil  Procedure have been fully complied with. <\/p>\n<p>This brings us now to a consideration oi appellants' second assignment of error, viz, the testator's alleged mental incapacity at the time of the execution of the will.  Upon this point  considerable evidence was adduced at the trial. One of the attesting witnesses  testified that at the time of the execution of the will the testator was in his right  mind, and that  although he was  seriously ill,  he  indicated  by movements of his head what his wishes were.  Another of the attesting witnesses stated that he was not able to  say whether decedent had the full use of his mental  faculties or not, because he had been ill for some years, and that he (the witness)  was not a physician.  The other subscribing witness, Pedro Paguio,  testified in the lower court as a witness for the opponents.  He was unable to state whether or not the will was the wish  of the testator.  The only reasons he gave for his  statement were the infirmity and advanced age of  the  testator and  the  fact  that  he was unable  to  speak.   This witness stated  that the  testator signed  the  will, and he verified his own signature as a subscribing witness.<\/p>\n<p>Florentino Ramos,  although  not  an  attesting witness, stated that he was present when the will was executed and his  testimony  was cumulative in  corroboration  of the manner in which the will was executed  and  as to the fact that the testator signed the will.  This witness also stated that he had frequently transacted matters of business for the decedent and had written letters and made inventories of his property at  his request, and that immediately before and after the execution of the will he had performed offices of this character.  He stated that the decedent was able to communicate his thoughts by writing.  The  testimony of this witness clearly indicates the presence of mental capacity on the part of the testator.  Among other  witnesses for the opponents were two physicians, Doctor  Basa and Doctor  Viado.  Doctor Basa testified that he  had attended the testator some four or five years prior to his death and that the latter  had suffered  from  a  cerebral congestion from which the paralysis resulted.  The  following question was propounded to Doctor Basa:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. Referring to the mental condition in which you found him the last time you attended him, do you think  he was in his right mind?\u2014A. I  can not say exactly whether  he was in his right mind, but I noted  some mental  disorder, because when  I spoke  to him he did not answer me.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Doctor Basa testified at  more length,  but the  substance of his testimony is that the testator had suffered a paralysis and that he had  noticed some  mental disorder.  He does not say that  the  testator was not in his right mind at the time  of the execution  of  the will, nor  does he give it as his opinion that he was without the necessary mental capacity to make a valid will.  He did not state in what way this mental disorder had manifested itself other than that he  had noticed that the testator did not  reply  to him on one  occasion  when  he visited him.<\/p>\n<p>Doctor Viado, the other physician, had never seen the testator,  but his answer  was in reply to a  hypothetical question  as  to what would  be the  mental condition  of  a person who  was 79 years old and who  had suffered from a malady such as the testator was supposed to have had according to the testimony  of Doctor Basa, whose testimony Doctor Viado had heard.  He replied and discussed at some length the symptoms and consequences of the disease  from which the testator had  suffered;  he  read  in support of his statements from a work by a German physician,  Dr. Herman Eichost  In answer, however, to a direct question, he stated that he  would be unable to  certify to the mental condition of a person who was suffering from such  a disease.<\/p>\n<p>We do not think that the  testimony of these two physicians in any way strengthens the contention of the appellants.  Their testimony only  confirms  the  fact  that the testator had  been for a number of years prior to his death afflicted with paralysis, in consequence of  which his physical and mental  strength was greatly impaired.   Neither of them attempted to state what was the mental condition of the testator at the time he executed the  will  in question. There can be no doubt that  the testator's  infirmities were of a very serious character, and it is quite evident that his mind  was not as active as it had been in the earlier years of his life.   However, we can  not conclude from this that he was wanting  in the necessary mental  capacity to dispose of h'is property by will.<\/p>\n<p>The courts have been called upon frequently to nullify wills  executed under such circumstances,  but  the weight of authority  is in support of the principle that it is only when  those seeking to overthrow the will have clearly established the charge of mental incapacity that the courts will intervene to set  aside  a testamentary  document  of  this character.  In the case of Bugnao <em>vs.<\/em> Ubag (14 Phil. Rep., 163),  the question of testamentary capacity was  discussed by this court.  The numerous citations  there given from the decisions of  the  United States courts are especially           applicable to the case at bar and have our approval.  In this jurisdiction the presumption of law is  in favor of the mental capacity of the testator and the burden is upon the contestants  of  the  will to prove the lack of testamentary capacity.   (In  the matter of the will of Cabigting, 14 Phil. Rep., 463; in the matter of the will  of Butalid,  10.Phil. Rep., 27; Hernaez vs. Hernaez, 1 Phil. Rep., 689.)<\/p>\n<p>The rule  of  law relating to the presumption of mental soundness is well established, and the testator in  the  case at bar never having been adjudged insane by a  court of competent jurisdiction, this presumption continues,  and it is therefore incumbent  upon the opponents  to overcome this legal presumption by proper evidence.  This we think they have failed to do.   There are many cases and authorities which  we might cite to  show that the courts have repeatedly held that mere weakness  of mind and body, induced by age and disease do  not render a person incapable of making a wilh   The law does not require that a person shall continue in the full enjoyment and use of his pristine physical  and mental powers  in  order to execute a valid will.  If such were the  legal standard, few indeed  would be the number of wills that coulii meet such exacting requirements.   The authorities, both medical and legal,  are universal  in the statement  that the  question of mental capacity is one of degree, and that there are many gradations from the highest degree  of mental soundness  to  the lowest conditions of diseased mentality which are  denominated as insanity and idiocy.<\/p>\n<p>The right to dispose  of property by  testamentary  disposition is as  sacred as any other  right which a person may exercise and this right  should not be nullified  unless mental incapacity is  established in a  positive and conclusive manner.   In discussing  the question of testamentary capacity, it is stated in volume 28, page 70, of the American and English Encyclopedia  of Law, that\u2014 <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Contrary to the very prevalent lay impression, perfect soundness of mind  is not essential to  testamentary capacity.  A testator may be afflicted with a variety of mental weaknesses, disorders, or peculiarities and still be capable in law of executing a valid will.\"  (See the numerous cases there cited in support of this statement.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The rule  relating to testamentary capacity is stated in Buswell on Insanity, section 365, and quoted with approval in Campbell <em>vs.<\/em> Campbell  (130  I11., 466), as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"To constitute a  sound and  disposing  mind, it  is  not necessary that  the  mind  shall  be  wholly unbroken,  unimpaired, or unshattered by disease or otherwise,  or that the testator should be in the full possession of his reasoning faculties.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In note, 1 Jarman on  Wills, 38, the rule is thus stated:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The question is not so much, what was the degree of memory possessed by the  testator, as, had he a disposing memory?  Was he able to remember the property he was about to bequeath,  the manner  of distributing it, and  the objects  of  his bounty?  In  a word, were his  mind and memory sufficiently  sound to enable him to  know and understand  the  business in which he was engaged  at  the time when he executed his will.\"   (See authorities  there cited.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In Wilson <em>vs.<\/em> Mitchell (101  Penn., 495),  the following facts appeared upon the trial of  the case: The testator died at the age of nearly 102 years.   In his early years he was an intelligent  and  well informed man.  About seven  years prior to his death  he suffered a paralytic stroke and from that time his mind and memory were much enfeebled.  He became  very dull  of hearing and  in  consequence of the shrinking of his brain he was affected with senile cataract causing total blindness.  He became filthy and  obscene in his habits, although formerly he was observant of the proprieties of life.  The court, in commenting upon the case, said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Neither  age, nor sickness, nor extreme  distress, nor debility of body will affect the capacity  to  make  a will, if sufficient  intelligence remains.  The failure of memory is not sufficient to create the incapacity, unless it be total, or extend to  his immediate family or property.   *  *  *<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">*\t    *      *       *      *      *    *<\/p>\n<p>\"Dougal (the testator) had lived over one hundred years before he made the will, and his physical and mental weakness and defective memory were in striking contrast with their strength in the meridian of his life.  He was blind; not deaf, but hearing impaired; his mind acted slowly, he was forgetful of  recent  events, especially of names,  and repeated questions in conversation; and sometimes, when aroused from sleep or slumber, would seem bewildered.  It is not singular that some of  those who had known him when he  was  remarkable for vigor and intelligence,  are of the opinion that his reason was so far gone that  he was incapable of making a will,  although they never heard him utter an irrational  expression.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the above case  the  will was sustained.   In  the case at bar we might draw the  same contrast as was pictured by the court in the case just quoted.   The striking  change in the physical and mental vigor of the testator during the last years of his life may have led some of those who knew him in his earlier days to entertain doubts as to his  mental capacity to make a will, yet we think that the statements of the witnesses to the execution of the will and the statemerits of the, conduct of the testator at that time all indicate that he unquestionably had mental capacity and that he exercised it on this occasion.  At the time of the execution of the will it does not appear that his conduct was irrational in any particular.  He seems to have comprehended clearly what the nature of  the business was in which he was engaged.   The evidence shows that the writing and execution of the will occupied a period  of several hours and that  the  testator was  present during all this time, taking an  active part in  all the proceedings.  Again, the will in the case at  bar is perfectly reasonable  and its dispositions are those  of a rational person.<\/p>\n<p>For the  reasons  above stated, the order probating the will should be and the same is hereby affirmed, with costs of this instance against the appellants.<\/p>\n<p><em> Arellano,  C.

Failure to make the proper accounts for money received shall be held to be prima facie evidence of embezzlement of the sums received and not accounted for.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The accused was a deputy treasurer in the office of the provincial treasurer of the Province of Cagayan, and was treasurer of the subprovince of Apayao from November 16, 1907, until June 3, 1908. In his official capacity he had received for disbursement the sum of P3,000. On the 3d day of June, 1908, he was suspended from office and directed to turn over all of his official books and records, which he accordingly did. On June 29, 1909, he was formally removed from office by order of the Executive Secretary. On the 28th day of September, 1909, the accused received a letter through the district auditor, purporting to come from the office of the Insular Auditor, of the following tenor:<br\/><blockquote> \"THE GOVERNMENT OP THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, \"BUREAU OF AUDITS.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"Manila, P. I., <i>July 22, 1909<\/i>.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"SIR: I have the honor to advise you that the provincial treasurer of Cagayan holds your receipt for P3,000 and that you have submitted vouchers for only P2,121.38, leaving a balance of P878.62. Under the provisions of section 30 of Act 1792, it is therefore requested that you render account for the balance, P878.62, without delay.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: left;\">\"Respectfully,<br\/><\/div><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"W. H. Clarke, <i>Auditor<\/i>.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"Mr. Isidro Maguidad, <br\/><br\/>\"<i>Tuguegarao, Cagayan<\/i>.\"<br\/><br\/>The information herein which was filed by the fiscal of the Province of Cagayan on the 24th day of November, 1909, formally charges the accused with the violation of the provisions of section 3 of Act No. 749 of the Philippine Commission, and it is alleged in said information that the accused failed to \"render account to the provincial treasurer of Cagayan, or to the auditor of this district, at any time subsequent to the 31st day of May, 1908, of a disbursement of a sum of P878.62 * * * although called upon to do so by him, to wit: by the auditor of this district, on the 28th day of September, 1909.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The last account rendered by the accused was on May 31, 1908, in which a balance was shown in favor of the Government for the sum of P878.62. This was about a month prior to his removal from office.<br\/><br\/>There is no dispute as to the facts of this case, but several questions touching the proper interpretation to be given to the Act upon which the information is based, as well as the insufficiency of the information itself, are presented by the assignments of error which are urged by appellant's counsel.<br\/><br\/>A reading of section 3 of Act No. 749 makes it quite evident that the purpose and intent of the law was to impose a special duty upon the officers and agents of the Insular Government. All such officials as are required by law to render accounts to the Insular Auditor are specifically brought under its provisions. The accused clearly was not an official of the Government at the time he was requested to render an account of the balance charged against him. He had been suspended from office June 3, 1908, and had been formally removed from office by the Executive Secretary on June 29, 1909, while the demand for an accounting was not made until the 28th day of September, 1909. The letter appears to have been written in the Auditor's office July 22, 1909, but it was delivered to the defendant through the district auditor and did not come into his hands until some two months later. It is to be remembered that the record does not present any question relating to the guilt of the accused for embezzlement or the malversation of public funds. He may, or he may not, have been guilty of official misconduct of this character. He is formally charged with failure to render an account as provided for in section 3 of said Act No. 749. The one question then which forces itself upon the consideration of the court is whether or not the provisions of that section are applicable to the accused under the facts as they appear of record. As a rule the rendition of a true and reliable account of the disbursement of money by an official can be made only by one having access to the records and vouchers of the office to which the matter in hand might relate. It would, in many cases, be a practical impossibility for a person to make such a report after he has been removed from office and has turned over all his official records and data to another. The case at bar offers the situation of a person charged with a failure to render an account of his official disbursements when at the time of such failure to so render the account he had been removed from that office for more than a year.<br\/><br\/>We do not think that the law in question was intended to include officials who have been removed from office at the time the demand for the accounting was made. The language of the statute will not bear any such interpretation. It clearly relates only to demands made of Government officials while they are engaged in the discharge of their official duties. It is simply an added duty which is imposed upon a certain class of governmental employees. When the official connection is severed, it may well become impossible to perform the duty. It would be absurd to hold that the Government may render it impossible for one of its employees to render an account by removing him from office, and thereafter prosecute and convict him for his failure so to do.<br\/><br\/>Our view of the applicability of the section in question makes unnecessary any further consideration of the assignments of error urged by counsel for appellant.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction of the defendant and the sentence imposed by the trial court are reversed, and the accused acquitted of the offense with which he is charged, with the costs of both instances <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<\/div>",

The plaintiff states that he instituted this action in the name and as the representative of his wife and alleges that she, by virtue of inheritance from her deceased mother, is the owner of the lands in  question.   Benita Reymundo is in no wise made a party to the action except in this  manner. That Benita  Reymundo is the real party in interest cannot be doubted.  The first inquiry is whether the husband alone can  maintain this action in the  name and  as the representative of  his wife.  The plaintiff is seeking to recover the paraphernal property of his wife as her legal representative.   Upon  their marriage, a conjugal partnership was formed and the husband became the administrator of this conjugal partnership,  but not of his  wife's  paraphernal property.  The ownership of such property always remains in the wife.   (Arts. 1381,1393, and 1412, Civil Code.)   The husband cannot institute  actions  of any kind whatsoever with regard to the paraphernal property of his wife  without her intervention or consent.   (Idem, art. 1383.)  The provisions of the above-named articles continue the ownership, coittrol, and management of the wife's paraphernal property in her own hands.  The new code makes no changes as  to these matters.  The wife cannot  alienate,  encumber, or mortgage the paraphernal property without the permission of her husband, nor appear in court to litigate with regard to the same, unless she has been judicially authorized for that purpose.  (Idem, 1389.)  That part of this article relating to the wife's appearance in court has been repealed by section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.   (Bismorte <em>vs.<\/em> Aldecoa &amp; Co. 17 Phil. Rep., 480.)  The wife can now appear in court alone and litigate with regard to her property in which her husband has no interest.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to the promulgation of the new Code of Civil Procedure, the husband was the legal representative of the wife and as such could, with her consent, institute and maintain actions and  other legal proceedings for and on her behalf, and  the orders, judgments, and  decrees rendered in such actions and  proceedings  determined  her rights therein. This he had  a right to do under the law.  Now, has  this right been taken away by the provisions of Act No. 190? Section 114 of the new Code of Civil Procedure provides that every action must be prosecuted in the  name of the real  party in interest.  But a person expressly authorized by law so to do may sue  or be sued without joining with him the person for whose benefit the action is prosecuted or defended. Section 115 authorizes a married woman to sue or be sued alone when the action concerns her property in which  her husband can have no interest or right.  And section  122 requires the bringing in of other parties when a complete determination of the controversy cannot be had without them.  It is important to note that the language used in  the first part of section 114 relative to the real party in interest is imperative; while that in relation to a person expressly  authorized  by law to represent another is permissive.  In the former, the word \"must\" is  used; in the latter, the auxiliary \"may.\"  Again, it  can hardly be said that  the legislature intended to include the husband in the phrase \"or a person expressly authorized by law so to do,\" when, in the very next section, it took up the question of    the relation of husband and wife with reference to  when the husband must be joined when the wife is a party.  Here the husband is not joined on account of his marital relations, but this joining of the husband results from the existence and nature of the common interest.  And again, the first part of section  114 is  general  and imperative, while the persons included within the phrase \"or a person expressly authorized by law so to do\" are exceptions, and that phrase must be. construed in connection with the section of which it forms a part.  This phrase is found in the latter part of the section, and just before  and after  it, and in  fact, the whole of  that part of the section  deals with  persons appointed by a court, with the single exception of a trustee of an expressed trust; so it would appear that the legislature intended to limit the phrase \"or a person expressly authorzed by law so to do\" to that class of persons dealt with in that part of  the section.  Prior to  the  enactment of these provisions, the husband, as we have said, was Authorized to institute and maintain certain actions for and on behalf of the wife, but such authority was conferred upon him by the procedural law and he cannot, therefore, claim to have acquired  a vested right, as  no  person  can claim a vested right in any particular mode of procedure for the enforcement or defense of rights.<\/p>\n<p>Under the provisions of section 122 of the new code, the court must require that all the parties benbrought in if a complete  determination of the controversy cannot be had without their presence.  There is a defect of parties  plaintiff in the case at bar.  Defect of parties as here used means too few and not too many.   The wife of the plaintiff, being a real party in interest, must be brought in.<\/p>\n<p>For these reasons the judgment appealed from is set aside and the case remanded for the purpose of making the plaintiff's wife  a party to this suit.  Here we desire  to remark that this case was not by any  means well tried in the court below.  Little attempt was made to establish the rights, of the parties by means of witnesses in open  court. Neither was there any real attempt made to establish the location and description of the land in question.  The court and the parties practically relied upon the very imperfect report of a commissioner.   On the new trial,  it is hoped that  the  parties will make some attempt to try this  cause according to  the  law.   No costs  will be allowed  in this instance,<\/p>\n<p><em> Arellano,  C.  J., Johnson, Carson,<\/em>  and <em>Moreland,  JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><em> Mapa, J.,<\/em> concurs in the result.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

P., agreeing to the sum centavos an hour, and to return it after one hour;\u00a0 but having\u00a0 taken away said bicycle he did not return\u00a0 it at the\u00a0 time agreed or\u00a0 pay the\u00a0 rental thereof, but he did willfully, illegally, and maliciously and against the owner take possession of\u00a0 it for himself and for the sake of gain, keeping in his possession until January 29, 1911, when the\u00a0 said bicycle was found possession\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 accused in the town\u00a0 of Imus, Province of Cavite I.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Accepting, as\u00a0 we\u00a0 do, the findings of\u00a0 the trial\u00a0 court as to the\u00a0 credit and the lack of credibility of the different witnesses for the prosecution for the defense, the evidence\u00a0 of record conclusively\u00a0 establishes the gu the defendant\u00a0 and appellant of the\u00a0 crime of\u00a0 <em>estafa<\/em> charged in t information,\u00a0 and defined\u00a0 and penalized in section 5 of article 535\u00a0 of Penal Code,\u00a0 read together\u00a0 with section 1 of article 534.<\/p><p>Counsel for the appellant contends that since the information fails\u00a0 expressly to allege that the bicycle in question had a specific definite value, and forth just what that value\u00a0 was, a judgment of conviction upon this information should\u00a0 not\u00a0 be sustained.\u00a0 But\u00a0 while\u00a0 it is true that a con of the crime of estafa cannot\u00a0 be sustained in the absence\u00a0 of proof that the\u00a0 subject matter of the fraud perpetrated\u00a0 by the accused had some value,\u00a0 and while in good practice a complaint or information charging the commission of the crime of <em>estafa<\/em>\u00a0 should specifically allege the value of the subject matter of the fraud where that is possible, we hold the mere\u00a0 omission of an allegation of the specific value of the bicycle mentioned in the information did not render it fatally defective, because facts alleged in the complaint, when proven, establish beyond any\u00a0 reason doubt\u00a0 that the\u00a0 bicycle\u00a0 had some value.\u00a0 The\u00a0 information\u00a0 alleges that the bicycle was\u00a0 the property of\u00a0 one\u00a0 Leoncio\u00a0 Pangilinan; that\u00a0 it was use, at\u00a0 the time when the\u00a0 crime was committed, in\u00a0 his bicycle renting establishment; and that\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant rented it from the\u00a0 owner and agreed\u00a0 to\u00a0 pay him 50\u00a0 cents per hour for its use.\u00a0 We think\u00a0 that these allegations are sufficient, when proven, to sustain and justify a finding bicycle in question had some value, and that it was the personal property the complaining witness; and it appearing\u00a0 that this bicycle\u00a0 had\u00a0 been converted or misappropriated by the defendant, in violation of\u00a0 the provision of\u00a0 subsection 5\u00a0 of article 535, the finding that the bicycle was person property of some\u00a0 value is sufficient to sustain a\u00a0 conviction Under the provisions of\u00a0 subsection 1 of article 534, which prescribes the penalty imposed where the value of the subject matter of the\u00a0 fraud is not shown be\u00a0 in excess of\u00a0 250 pesetas.\u00a0 In the case of the U.\u00a0 S. <em>vs.<\/em> De (12 Phil.

The defendant\u00a0 and\u00a0 appellant is, nevertheless, adjudged guilty of\u00a0 the\u00a0 offense charged in the information is to say, of the crime of <em>estafa<\/em> as defined and penalized in sect of article 535 of the Penal Code,\u00a0 read\u00a0 together with section 1 of article and there being no evidence as to the\u00a0 existence\u00a0 of aggravating\u00a0 or extenuating\u00a0 circumstances, we\u00a0 sentence\u00a0 him to the prescribed penalty in its medium degree, that is to say, to two months and one day of <em>arresto mayor,<\/em> and to pay the costs in both instances.

Abreu, judge.<\/p>\n<p>On  February 15,  1908, counsel for Angel Ortiz filed a written complaint  in the Court of First Instance  of Sorsogon,  against the  Chinaman,  Felix  Melliza, alias Pinga, wherein he alleged that about the years 1903 and 1904 the defendant was doing business with the commercial firm of \"Viuda e Hijos de  F. Suarez,\" and on January 31, 1905, the date when the defendant finally ceased to do business with the said firm, he  owed the latter the sum of P4,037.82, according to a balance struck on that date, a copy of which Was attached to the  complaint; that, on January 28, 1907, Angel Ortiz  purchased from \"Viuda e Hijos de  F. Suarez\" all the shares and accounts held by this firm in the Province of Sorsogon, there thus being transferred to Angel Ortiz the credit of P4,037.82 of the said \"Viuda e Hijos de F. Suarez;\" and that the defendant Chinaman, Felix Melliza, had not up to date paid this sum, though it had been demanded of him.  The plaintiff therefore prayed that judgment be rendered  by sentencing the  defendant to pay the sum of P4,037.82, with legal interest thereon from the date of the complaint until its final payment, and the costs of the suit.<\/p>\n<p>The demurrer to the complaint having been overruled, counsel for the  defendant  set forth  in  his answer  that he admitted the allegations of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the said complaint, and denied those of paragraphs 4, 6, and 7 of the same.<\/p>\n<p>In a cross complaint said counsel for the defendant represented: that when the plaintiff acquired from \"Viuda e Hijos de F. Suarez\" the accounts mentioned in  paragraph 5 of the complaint, he at  the  same time assumed all the debts, obligations and liabilities which the said firm had in the Province of Sorsogon; that the concern aforementioned unjustly and maliciously, on January 10, 1903, charged the defendant with the crime of estafa, before the justice of the peace of the pueblo of  Sorsogon and prosecuted the case until his filial acquittal by  the Supreme Court, on January 7, 1908, thereby  causing  his  said  unjust  and  malicious arrest and prosecution, moral sufferings and great damage to his public reputation, as well as large pecuniary losses and expenses made necessary by his attorney's fees and the legal proceedings  required finally to prove his  innocence, which damages amount to the sum of P25,000.   Therefore counsel for the defendant prayed that he be absolved from the complaint, and the plaintiff sentenced to pay him the damages claimed, and to pay the costs.<\/p>\n<p>The  demurrer interposed by counsel for the plaintiff against the  defendant's cross complaint was  sustained, on thte ground  that the latter was vague  and unintelligible, inasmuch as it contained no clear statement of the facts constituting the alleged  damages, and  because  the facts alleged did not constitute a cause of action, since, though the defendant's  claim was based on the judgment of acquittal rendered by the Supreme  Court on  January 7,  1908, yet           still it was not alleged that said decision held that the charge presented against the defendant was unjust and malicious; and therefore the cross complaint was dismissed.<\/p>\n<p>On March 23, 1908, counsel for  the defendant filed an amended answer to the complaint wherein he  stated that he admitted the allegations  of paragraphs 1, 2, and  3 of the complaint and denied each and all of those of the other paragraphs thereof;  that, as a special defense, he alleged that the accounts between the defendant and the said commercial firm had been settled long prior to the filing of the complaint, which settlement  showed that the former owed the latter nothing, and that subsequent to the  said settlement the defendant  had incurred no debt nor obligation towards the firm of \"Viuda e Hijos  de F. Suarez;\" and he therefore prayed that his client be absolved from the complaint and the costs assessed against the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>With the permission of the court, counsel for the defendant, on October 26, 1908, filed a written amended answer and cross complaint to the original  complaint,  wherein he set forth that he admitted the allegations of paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the complaint and denied each and all of those of the other paragraphs  thereof, and alleged that the accounts between  the defendant and \"Viuda e Hijos de F. Suarez\" had been settled long prior.to the filing of the complaint, in which settlement it was found that the former no longer owed anything either to the latter or their successors, and that subsequently thereto the defendant had not contracted any debt or obligation towards either the said firm or the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>As  a counterclaim  and cross complaint, he alleged that Angel Ortiz purchased, on January 28, 1907, from the firm of \"Viuda e Hijos de F. Suarez,\" all the liabilities, shares and accounts which the latter company had in the Province\" of Sorsogon; that,  in November,  1902, the defendant  and the aforesaid company  entered into a verbal contract by virtue of which  the defendant bound himself to deliver to the commercial  house before mentioned,  hemp, upon the allowance of a commission of one peso for each picul; that, under this agreement, the defendant did deliver to the said firm 386 piculs and 35 cates of hemp; that, in December of that year, the same parties made a verbal contract whereby the firm of \"Viuda e Hyos de F. Suarez\"  promised the defendant a commission of one peso and fifty centavos for each picul of hemp that he should deliver to it, and that he did deliver to the same 1,171 piculs and 73 cates of the said product, for which his commission was P1,757.44, and the whole of the commissions earned by the defendant amounted to the sum of \u00a32,143.79, which sum had not been paid to him,  either by \"Viuda  e Hijos de F. Suarez\"  or by the plaintiff, with the exception of P303, there remaining in defendant's favor a balance of P1,840.79 still unpaid and owing him.   Said counsel, therefore, prayed that judgment be  rendered  against the plaintiff party  for the sum  of P1,840.79,  with legal interest thereon,  and for the costs of the suit.<\/p>\n<p>On the same date, October 26, 1908, counsel for the plaintiff, in answer to the cross complaint and counterclaim presented by the defendant, set forth in writing that he admitted paragraph 1 of the cross complaint and denied paragraphs 2 and 3 of the same, and  requested that  the plaintiff  be absolved from the said cross complaint and that judgment be given against the defendant for the sum specified in the complaint, together with the legal interest thereon, and for the costs.<\/p>\n<p>In  another writing of  the  same  date, counsel for the plaintiff represented that in the  balanced  account  accompanying the complaint there did not appear two items which had been erroneously omitted  therefrom and which consisted of the following debit items:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<table border=\"0\" width=\"80%\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>February 7-26 S. of salt......................................................<\/td>\n<td><div align=\"right\">P56.25<\/div><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>February 7 L-652 S.

Counsel for the defendant excepted to this judgment and  asked for a rehearing on the grounds that the judgment was contrary to the weight of the evidence and to the law.  This motion was denied, exception was entered by the defendant, whose counsel duly filed the required bill of exceptions, which was approved by an order of July 6th in which provision was also made for the execution of the judgment, unless the appellant-defendant should file a bond for P6,000 to respond for the sum which is the subject matter of the judgment,  with interest and costs,  which bond appears to have been filed;, according to a notarial certificate of the 3d of August, 1909, and the bill of exceptions, with a transcript of the evidence, was forwarded to the clerk of this court.<\/p>\n<p>This suit concerns the collection of the sum of P4,037.82 which, according to  the balance sheet attached to the complaint, the defendant Chinaman, Felix  Melliza, alias Pinga, ojw.es the counsel for  Angel Ortiz who, on January 28, 1907, acquired from the firm known as  \"Viuda e Hijos de F. Suarez,\" established  in Sorsogon, all the rights, snares and accounts that belonged to the said  firm, among them, the account aforementioned owed by the defendant on the date of the complaint.<\/p>\n<p>The  defendant  Chinaman denied the correctness of the balance sheet accompanying the complaint, as well  also as that of the contents of the memorandum  book, exhibited under letter A, by the plaintiff, as proof of the debt claimed.<\/p>\n<p>In view of the fact that the defendant did not admit as true and legitimate  all the items  contained  in the said balance sheet and  in the memorandum book  exhibited in evidence, and  denied the alleged  certainty of  the  debt claimed, it was an  indispensable requisite for the enforcement of payment that the plaintiff satisfactorily prove that the defendant  did  really owe him  the sum  set out in the complaint.<\/p>\n<p>Article 1214 of the Civil Code provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Proof of obligations devolves upon the persons claiming their fulfillment, and that of their extinction upon those opposing it.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>There is perfect  accord between this statutory provision and the doctrine laid down by the supreme court of Spain in its decisions of November 3, 1902, and October 30, 1903, in so far as it  declares that it is incumbent  upon him who avers the facts to prove them.<\/p>\n<p>In conformity with the provision contained in the foregoing article,  section 297 of the Code of Civil Procedure prescribes;<\/p>\n<p>\"Each party must  prove his own  affirmative allegations. Evidence need not be given in support of a negative allegation except when such negative  allegation  is  an essential part of the statement of the right or title on which  the cause of action or defense is founded, nor even in such case when the allegation is a denial of the existence of a document, the custody of which belongs to the opposite party.\"<\/p>\n<p>It is not sufficient that he who claims to be the creditor should have presented, as proof of the existence and certainty of the debt of  P4,037.82, the balance sheet  of an account which  lacks the necessary assent and acceptance  of  the debtor, but it is indispensable that,  in the absence of this requisite,  the debt  be proven  by other means of evidence recognized by law and that there be exhibited the due bills and receipts which,  according to the allegation of the debtor, were issued by the latter in  exchange for the sums and effects which he had  taken or received from the aforesaid firm.  The testimony of the former  manager of that comany, contradicted by the defendant and uncorroborated by other evidence, is not sufficient to prove the certainty of the debt as set forth in the complaint and admitted in the judgment appealed from.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant, however, testifying under oath and with the notes before him which he had made in a book presented by him at the  hearing and written in Chinese characters, stated, among  other things, as follows; that, according to the last settlement had between himself and the head of the Suarez firm, on March 2, 1903,  as a result of certain transactions made by them, noted in the book above mentioned there was a balance against witness of P3,647.22, though, on the 2d of May  following, this sum he had until then owed, was paid, through a final settlement effected for the purpose, upon which transaction he took up all the receipts against him held by the said firm.<\/p>\n<p>The debtor Chinaman, Melliza, alias Pinga, has not furnished proof of any kind to establish his payment of the said sum which he admitted he owed the creditor  firm, as disclosed by the settlement on  March 2, 1903; wherefore, though it is proper to accept his own statement, freely made, that he was a debtor of the said firm in the amount of P3,647.22, according to the notes' in his own book,  there is no reason, for lack of conclusive evidence, why the payment of this sum should be held to have been proved, and, therefore, the  judgment should be  modified by sentencing the defendant  to the payment only of the sum which he admitted he owed, as a memorandum made  in his own book, and the amount awarded in the judgment appealed from can not be held to be correct, as it was not established by good and sufficient evidence.<\/p>\n<p>The mere affirmation on the part of the debtor that a settlement had  been effected of the accounts between himself and the creditor firm which had arisen through the mercantile transactions and relations that they had had is not sufficient to warrant the finding that payment was made of a debt which.he, the defendant himself, admitted he had entered in  his own book, because it is indispensable  for him to prove that as a result of the said settlement and upon the closing of the account, the debt, originating from such account, disappeared and ceased to exist, by reason of its payment by the debtor.  So, the sentence to make payment is founded on the defendant debtor's own admission.<\/p>\n<p>Neither does the record disclose proof of the special agreement alleged by the defendant that the said  firm obligated itself to pay him, as a commission, one peso  for each picul of hemp that  he should  acquire and deliver  to the Suarez firm during the month of November, 1902, and, also as a commission, one pesb and fifty  centavos for each picul of hemp purchased for and delivered to the said firm during the month of December of that  year, because,  upon the denial of  these alleged  facts by  the  plaintiff party, the defendant did not furnish any proof 'whatever of the  said agreement and of the special extra remuneration stipulated as a  commission for the gathering of hemp during such months of November and December, 1902.<\/p>\n<p>For the  foregoing reasons,  whereby  some of the  errors ascribed to the judgment appealed from are held to have been  refuted,  the latter should  be, in  our opinion, and is hereby affirmed; provided, however, that the defendant is sentenced to pay only the' sum of  P3,647.22,  with legal interest thereon from February 15, 1908, until the date of payment; and the costs of this instance.<\/p>\n<p><em> Arellano, C.

The abduction of a  woman against her will and with lewd designs shall be punished by reclusidn temporal.<\/p>\n<p>\"The same penalty shall  be imposed in every case if the female abducted be under twelve years of age.<\/p>\n<p>\"ART. 446. The abduction of a virgin over twelve and under twenty-three years of age, committed with her consent, shall  be punished by  prisidn correctional in its  minimum and medium degrees.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Under the provisions of the latter section, while they were in force, one who induced a woman, of her own free will and accord, to leave her home without the consent of her father or other lawful guardian, as in the case at bar, was guilty of the crime of abduction, as defined and penalized in this section, if she was over 12 years of age  or less than 23.  In declaring that  a woman may be abducted, with her <em>own consent,<\/em> up to the notably advanced age of 23, the legislator evidently had in mind the provisions of the former law touching the status of women less than 23 years of age. Under that  law a woman less than 23 years of  age was placed under the strict control of her father or other legal guardian; and so strict  was  this control that until  she arrived at this age. she could  not  marry without his  consent, and he had the right to restrain her freedom so as to prevent her from doing so.  With the change of sovereignty however these strict provisions have been somewhat relaxed, and the age at which a woman may leave her home and marry without the consent of her father or other legal guardian is fixed at 18 years.  We think that this change of the status of women between 18 and 23 years of age draws with it, by necessary implication, a modification of the penal provisions of the above cited article 446  of the Penal Code, and that the age limit under which a woman may be abducted, with her own consent, must be held to be the same as the age limit under which she is forbidden to marry without  the  consent of her  father or other legal guardian.<\/p>\n<p>The woman whom the defendant is charged with abducting was over nineteen years of age, and we are of opinion therefore that the proofs do not establish the commission of the crime with which he is charged.<\/p>\n<p>It may be that he was guilty of seduction or some other allied offense; but the complaint in this case was for the crime of abduction, of  which defendant is manifestly not guilty if our conclusions as to the modifications of the age limit set out in article 446 are correct.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the court below convicting the defendant and imposing sentence upon  him is reversed, and  he is acquitted of the  offense  with which he is charged, with the costs of both instances <em>de oficio.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

The remaining seven, namely, Agustin Jueves, Roberto Toacar, Felix Jueves,\u00a0 Pedro Toacar, Cesareo\u00a0 Penamonte, Ciriaco Manigo, and Mauricio Manigo, were convicted\u00a0 as above stated, and have all\u00a0 appealed to this court.<\/p><p>Graciana\u00a0 Laiman testified that she\u00a0 was\u00a0 the wife and sister-in-law, respectively, of Francisco Ambas and Martin Ambas, both deceased.\u00a0 She testified that of the accused she recognized all of the seven who were finally convicted by\u00a0 the trial court as being members of the gang\u00a0 who took\u00a0 the prisoners referred to in paragraph 2.\u00a0\u00a0 She stated that she was an eyewitness\u00a0 to\u00a0 this occurrence; that Agustin and Felix Jueves were, during 1904, and still are, residents of a neighboring barrio; that Roberto and Pedro Toacar lived in her own barrio and\u00a0 near her own home; that she knew Mauricio Manigo because he was\u00a0 a\u00a0 woodcutter for her brother-in-law, and that at the time her husband was taken prisoner he lived in a neighboring barrio; that she remembered Giriaco Manigo because while the\u00a0 band was\u00a0 at the house there was a good light; that she had seen him again in the court at Daet; and that she recognized him\u00a0 in the court during the trial of this case.\u00a0 As for\u00a0 Cesario Penamonte, she stated that he was with the\u00a0 Jueves and Manigo brothers on the night in question in 1904.<\/p><p>Doroteo Mercader (Maraver) testified regarding the same occurrence.\u00a0 He stated that the men taken prisoners were in his house at the time.\u00a0 This witness was\u00a0 one of the prisoners turned loose\u00a0 when the band reached the river. He identified all of the seven appellants in open court, calling them by name.<\/p><p>Angelo Lunasco testified regarding the same event.\u00a0 He stated that he was one of the prisoners turned loose on the band's arrival at the\u00a0 river.\u00a0 He recognized five\u00a0 of the accused and pointed them out on the stand as being the Jueves and\u00a0 Toacar brothers, and Mauricio Manigo.<\/p><p>Juan Talento testified regarding the occurrence on the night of Holy Thursday, 1904.\u00a0 He stated that he was taken prisoner by the band in question on that night.\u00a0\u00a0 He recognized Ciriaco\u00a0 Manigo\u00a0 and the Toacar brothers as\u00a0 being members\u00a0 of the gang.<\/p><p>Graciana\u00a0 Laiman states that Ciriaco Manigo\u00a0 was one of the party who carried off her\u00a0 husband on\u00a0 the night of February 4, 1904; that\u00a0 she saw him again in the court at Daet, and the third time during the trial of this\u00a0 case. Doroteo Mexcader (Maraver), who was taken prisoner on that night, testified that this man was one of the gang, and on being requested to do\u00a0 so, pointed him out to the court from among the rest.\u00a0 Juan Talento testified that Manigo was one of the party which took him prisoner on the night of Holy Thursday, 1904.\u00a0\u00a0 The testimony of these witnesses shows conclusively that Ciriaco Manigo was a\u00a0 member of the gang.<\/p><p>Cesareo Penamonte was pointed out by Graciana Laiman and Doroteo Mercader (Maraver) as being one of the band. Graciana Laiman stated that she saw him with the Jueves and Manigo brothers on that night.\u00a0 Mercader testified that this defendant was a resident of his own barrio.<\/p><p>There\u00a0 is no\u00a0 evidence controverting\u00a0 the\u00a0 declarations of these witnesses.\u00a0 These witnesses had excellent opportunities to\u00a0 note the features of the different members of the party, while it was engaged in its unlawful acts.\u00a0 The guilt of all the appellants has been established beyond any question of a doubt by direct and positive testimony.<\/p><p>Counsel insist, first, that the\u00a0 court\u00a0 of\u00a0 Tayabas\u00a0 had no jurisdiction\u00a0 to try these\u00a0 appellants for the reason that the territory where the\u00a0 acts\u00a0 complained\u00a0 of\u00a0 were committed belonged to\u00a0 the Province of Ambos Camarines at the time of the commission of said\u00a0 acts, although it has since been transferred\u00a0 to the Province of Tayabas; and second, that section 3 of Act No. 518 is invalid as opposed to the Philippine Bill.\u00a0\u00a0 The record showing nothing to\u00a0 the\u00a0 contrary, we assume that the complaint was filed subsequent to the transfer\u00a0 of\u00a0 territory in question.\u00a0 Such\u00a0 being\u00a0 the case, the question is raised\u00a0 Does a court have jurisdiction of crimes committed in\u00a0 a\u00a0 particular locality prior\u00a0 to the time such locality was included within the jurisdiction of such\u00a0 court?\u00a0 If\u00a0 this question can\u00a0 be answered\u00a0 in\u00a0 the affirmative, we do not need to\u00a0 consider the validity of section 3 of Act No. 518 in\u00a0 order to dispose of this objection.<\/p><p>The general rule is that the jurisdiction of a court is determined (1) by the geographical limits of the territory over which\u00a0 it\u00a0 presides,\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0 (2), the actions (civil and criminal) it is\u00a0 empowered to\u00a0 hear and decide.\u00a0\u00a0 Thai the Court of First Instance of Tayabas would have had jurisdiction of this cause had the unlawful acts of the appellants been committed\u00a0 subsequent to the transfer of this small strip of territory must be conceded.<\/p><p>Questions\u00a0 of jurisdiction d,o not arise and cannot\u00a0 be decided until the initial pleadings in an action are presented to a court.\u00a0\u00a0 A court has an inchoate right of jurisdiction over all crimes\u00a0 committed within its jurisdiction\u00a0 which is perfected on the institution.of the\u00a0 action.\u00a0\u00a0 If, however, it loses jurisdiction\u00a0 over a\u00a0 particular action\u00a0 because its territorial limits are restricted prior to the institution of the action, it also loses this\u00a0 inchoate right to jurisdiction\u00a0 in favor\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 court to which the territory\u00a0 is transferred. Were the rule otherwise,\u00a0 it would be necessary to prolong a court's existence indefinitely\u00a0 after being legally abolished or after its authority had been legally restricted or\u00a0 diminished\u00a0 on\u00a0 the ground\u00a0 that\u00a0 it\u00a0 must hear possible actions arising sometime in the future.<\/p><p>The territory where the acts complained of in the case at bar were committed having been transferred to the Province of Tayabas prior to the institution of this\u00a0 action, the court of that province had jurisdiction to hear\u00a0 and determine this case.\u00a0\u00a0 (State <em>vs<\/em>.

After Faustirio Tansimsim\u00a0 had\u00a0 acknowledged\u00a0 under oath the authenticity of the\u00a0 document setting forth said agreement, the court by\u00a0 order\u00a0 of March\u00a0 21,\u00a0 1910, page 31, approved said agreement i all its parts, directing that from the sum of P13,000 which Mariano Gonzalez had to pay as the price of the\u00a0 fishpond\u00a0 Wawang\u00a0 Dap-dap\u00a0 and\u00a0 which should be on deposit with the clerk or in the <em>Banco Espanol-Filipino<\/em> the disposal\u00a0 of the court, there be deducted the sum of\u00a0 P2,115.50 with interest at 12 per cent a year from September\u00a0 1, 1902, to the date\u00a0 of deduction thereof,\u00a0 and paid to Remigia Hernandez.<\/p><p>At the request of the latter or her counsel, the court, by order of April 1910, directed that said administrator be required to obey the previous of March 21, by depositing the sum of P5,585,\u00a0 part of the price of sai sale, in the <em>Banco Espanol-Filipino<\/em>\u00a0 at the disposal of the Court Instance and not\u00a0 of the said administrator, Leoncio Barcelon.<\/p><p>On the same date, April 30, 1910, the administrator Barcelon presented a written petition for complete revocation of the part of said order of Ma 21, 1910, directing payment to Remigia Hernandez of the sum of P2,115.50 and asking that he be given an opportunity to prove to the court that such debt\u00a0 did\u00a0 not exist, wherefore\u00a0 he excepted to said resolution for the reasons set forth in his petition, page 37.<\/p><p>By another instrument of the same date the administrator Leoncio\u00a0 Barcel stated that he\u00a0 did\u00a0 not accept\u00a0 the\u00a0 part of the order of April 13, 191 (this should be April\u00a0 30), which directed the delivery of the proceeds the sale of said fishpond to other persons, even though they might be officials,\u00a0 wherefore he excepted to said resolution and asked that it b modified by setting aside that\u00a0 portion referring to deposit of the fund question, thus leaving free the administrator, who was under bond of P15,000 to answer for the administration of the property of said inherit so that he might fulfill his duty as administrator thereof.<\/p><p>Under date\u00a0 of July 2,\u00a0 1910,\u00a0 counsel for Remigia Hernandez presented a motion requesting:\u00a0 (1) That the administrator Leoncio Barcelon be\u00a0 punished for contempt for not having complied with the directions of the\u00a0 court i orders of March 21 and 26 and April 30; (2) that the said order of\u00a0 March 21, 1910, be executed by issuing the corresponding order of execution up the sum of P5,585, deposited in the <em>Banco Espanol-Filipino,<\/em> for t of P2,115.50\u00a0 with interest at the rate of 12 per\u00a0 cent a year from September 1, [1902]\u00a0 until date of payment.\u00a0 It was alleged that after t court had ordered deposited in the <em>Banco Espanol-Filipino<\/em> , at\u00a0 the disposal of the court, or\u00a0 with the clerk of the court, the P13,000, the of the fishpond Wawang Dap-dap, after deduction of the said sum of P2,115.50 with interest at the rate of 12 per cent a year from September until the date of deduction thereof and payment to Remigia Hernandez,\u00a0 t judicial\u00a0 administrator, Leoncio\u00a0 Barcelon, had not\u00a0 made\u00a0 the deposit the clerk or\u00a0 in the bank, wherefore the court should reiterate its prev order of March 26, but notwithstanding this, the administrator Barcelon April 27 following deposited in the <em>Banco Espanol-Filipino<\/em>\u00a0 as a account at his own\u00a0 disposal the sum of P5,685;\u00a0 and in spite of the fact that by another order of April 30, at the\u00a0 request\u00a0 of the party interest compliance with said order of March 21\u00a0 was\u00a0 again directed, the administrator Barcelon\u00a0 had without legal reason or ground failed to com with the foregoing orders,\u00a0 disregarding them entirely, and therefore he guilty of contempt, aside from the damages he had caused the creditor Hernandez, who had not to date collected\u00a0 her debt.<\/p><p>After hearing\u00a0 on\u00a0 this motion with the parties present, page 57, the co by order of October 31,\u00a0 1910, page 59, declared that there was no\u00a0 reason then for punishing Leoncio Barcelon for contempt and ordered him to comp with the provisions of the orders\u00a0 of March 21 and October 31 within the period of three days\u00a0 from notification of this resolution by delivering Remigia Hernandez\u00a0 said\u00a0 sum with the interest stated up to the date of delivery. Counsel for Leoncio Barcelon excepted to this decision.<\/p><p>By an instrument of November 7, 1910, counsel for the administrator Barcelon after having requested\u00a0 postponement of the\u00a0 date fixed for delivery of certain sum and interest to Remigia Hernandez, page 65, requested for the reasons he gave that the previous\u00a0 decision\u00a0 of October 31, 1910, be reconsidered and\u00a0 set aside, and\u00a0 that a date then be set for a regular hearing of the case in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, which request was\u00a0 denied\u00a0 by order of the 9th of the\u00a0 same month and year, whereupon said counsel for the administrator Barcelon excepted.<\/p><p>By virtue of the decision\u00a0 of the court on January 5, 1911, regarding the by preliminary injunction requested by the administrator Barcelon, and o request made by Hernandez's counsel,\u00a0 the court\u00a0 required the administrator Barcelon to file a bond of P4,000, and then admitted the appeals interposed by him against said order of\u00a0 March\u00a0 21,\u00a0 1910, and the other issued as a consequence thereof on April 30, October 31,\u00a0 and November 9 of the same year, 1910.<\/p><p>This case deals with fulfillment and execution of an agreement entered in between\u00a0 Leoncio Barcelon, administrator of the property of the deceased intestate Lucia Villalon and Faustino Tansimsim, special attorney in fact for his mother, Remigia Hernandez, lessee of the fishpond\u00a0 Wawang Dap-dap, belonging to said intestate, as\u00a0 it appears in an instrument dated Octob 29, 1908, signed by the contracting parties and approved by the order of March 21, 1910.<\/p><p>Said agreement is really a compromise designated in law as a consensual contract, reciprocal and for a consideration, whereby the parties settle means of mutual concessions a question that seems doubtful to them, for article 1809 of the Civil Code says:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"A compromise is a contract by which each of the parties in interest, by giving, promising, or retaining something, avoids the provocation of a s terminates one that has already\u00a0 been instituted.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>It was to the interest of the administration\u00a0 of that intestate estate to the\u00a0 public auction among other things the said fishpond Wawang Dap-dap, which its owner, Lucia Villalon, had in her\u00a0 lifetime\u00a0 leased to the sai Hernandez, and for this reason the latter, to avoid the great damage tha would be done her by the sale of the. said fishpond,\u00a0 as advertised in t newspaper \"El Renacimiento\" requested that said sale be disapproved if t heirs of the intestate did not acknowledge her lease' thereon.<\/p><p>For the purpose of forestalling and avoiding a lawsuit over whether in t sale of said fishpond the\u00a0 lease held by the lessee Hernandez should be respected or not,\u00a0 for she had already appealed to the court to protect rights, and regarding his own rights doubtful, the administrator Leoncio Barcelon compromised by recognizing her\u00a0 said rights so that the sale of fishpond might be consummated, and in fact by an instrument dated October 29, 1908, signed by himself and Remigia Hernandez's\u00a0 attorney\u00a0 i fact,\u00a0 they by mutual consent requested, in order to settle the question by\u00a0 her, that the court approve the agreement\u00a0 they had made in the term therein set forth.<\/p><p>The terms of the compromise set forth in said document drawn up oh October 29, 1908, being admitted, it is unquestionable that Remigia Hernandez could\u00a0 or could hot bid at the auction\u00a0 of the said fishpond t sum of P12,000 or more if she saw fit; that from the price of the sale t sum of P2,115.50 should be deducted, being amounts\u00a0 paid in advance as rent; that if she were .the\u00a0 purchaser the payment of the P9,885 or more should be made\u00a0 in four equal\u00a0 sums and on four fixed dates; that if another person should outbid her the administrator would request the court that the creditor Hernandez be paid first or otherwise the sale would be understood to be made on condition of respecting the pending lease or else Hernandez\u00a0 would be paid her credit, with interest at 12 per cent a year from September 1, 1902, the lease to be terminated by that sale.<\/p><p>Mere perusal of the agreement made by the parties satisfactorily demonstrates that they really agreed to a complete and perfect compromise for avoiding the\u00a0 suit about to be instituted,\u00a0 with the undeniable char of being. consensual, bilateral, and for a consideration,\u00a0 because the contracting parties by consent and mutual agreement made\u00a0 a stipulation involving reciprocal rights and\u00a0 obligations that spontaneously arise fr provisos\u00a0 and terms set forth in that document.<\/p><p>With reference to the effects of the compromise in question article 1816 the same code provides:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"A compromise has, with regard to the parties, the same authority as <em> adjudicata;<\/em> but summary proceedings shall not be proper except when fulfillment of a judicial compromise is in question.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The agreement or compromise\u00a0 stipulated by the parties and set forth in that document was expressly submitted in writing by the contracting part for the court's approval, and the Court\u00a0 of First Instance\u00a0 in\u00a0 view\u00a0 of fact that there was no law against it, saw\u00a0 fit to approve it throughout and said compromise thereby acquired the nature of\u00a0 a bar to the prosecution of a suit and gave to the question that had arisen between t lessee Hernandez and the administrator Barcelon the character\u00a0 of\u00a0<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> res adjudicata<\/span> with the effects of a\u00a0 final judgment between\u00a0 the parties wh had duly made it.<\/p><p>It is true that a compromise can be impugned as null and void under cert restrictions introduced by the code; but in the present case it does not appear that the compromise is null and void in the form and under.the conditions fixed by law.<\/p><p>Article 1817 of the same code prescribes:\u00a0 \"A compromise, in which error deceit, violence, or forgery\u00a0 of documents is involved, shall be' subject provisions of article 1265 of this code.\"<\/p><p>Article 1265 thus cited is as follows: \"Consent given by error,\u00a0 under v by intimidation, or deceit\u00a0 shall be void.\"<\/p><p>On account of its consensual character a compromise, to be valid and effective, requires in its performance meeting of the\u00a0 minds in a certain spontaneous, and free way with regard to a\u00a0 definite object or objects; in case\u00a0 it be shown\u00a0 and proved that there was error, deceit, violence, intimidation the\u00a0 compromise\u00a0 would be\u00a0 null, because the consent given therein is\u00a0 null and void through lack of the indispensable requisites f validity and effectiveness.<\/p><p>By agreement with the representative\u00a0 of the lessee Hernandez, the administrator Barcelon expressly and in writing requested approval of the agreement\u00a0 or compromise that both had stipulated; and it does not appear in the case at bar that before the order of approval of March\u00a0 21 1910, nor later up to the admission\u00a0 of the appeal that said compromise was attacked or impugned as null and void because it had\u00a0 been made through error, deceit, violence, or forgery of documents and he had not his part given due consent. Therefore said compromise acquired\u00a0 the auth of res adjudicata, so exact compliance with said order is\u00a0 just and prop though it were a\u00a0 case of\u00a0 execution of a final judgment.<\/p><p>Section 333, No. 1, of the Code of Civil Procedure says:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p> \"Whenever a par has, by his own declaration, act, or omission, intentionally\u00a0 and deliberately another to believe a particular thing true, and to act upon such belief, can not, in any litigation arising out of such declaration', act, or omission permitted to falsify it.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>By virtue\u00a0 of the agreement in the said\u00a0 compromise between the administrator Barcelon and the lessee Hernandez, the latter desisted fro objecting to the sale of\u00a0 the fish-pond Wawang Dap-dap in the belief that from the\u00a0 proceeds\u00a0 of the sale\u00a0 she\u00a0 would be reimbursed the amount she had paid in advance as rent for the\u00a0 lease of said fishpond; and after this had been executed it\u00a0 is neither just nor permissible for said administrator to go back on the stipulation in that contract\u00a0 without le ground or\u00a0 reason\u00a0 in law and be able thus capriciously to escape fulfill thereof.<\/p><p>The heirs interested\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 property administered by Barcelon did not intervene in the said contract of compromise, nor does it appear that the estate left by the deceased Lucia Villalon has been distributed among th and it further does not appear\u00a0 in the case at bar that any one of them has gone into court or presented any claim impugning the lease of said fishpond and the lessee's contentions.\u00a0\u00a0 On pages 74 to 87 of the testimony in the special proceedings are inserted various receipts for sums accept the lessee Remigia Hernandez\u00a0 as rent\u00a0 for that fishpond and signed by different persons apparently\u00a0 interested in\u00a0 that inheritance and by representatives of some of them, among which appear the signatures\u00a0 of Leoncio Barcelon,\u00a0 administrator of the property of the intestate, estate.<\/p><p>The different.questions raised by the administrator Barcelon in order to compliance with the order of March 21, 1910, have\u00a0 been\u00a0 examined\u00a0 and decided by\u00a0 the\u00a0 later orders of October 31 and November 9, which, with that of April 30, 1910,\u00a0 were\u00a0 issued as\u00a0 a consequence and for the execution of the first cited one of March 21.<\/p><p>The administrator Barcelon requested the sale at\u00a0 public auction of that fishpond and because of the objection of the lessee Hernandez, Barcelon, order to avoid a lawsuit with\u00a0 her, entered into this agreement\u00a0 for\u00a0 a compromise. Both\u00a0 contracting parties submitted\u00a0 it by mutual consent to court hearing the proceedings in the intestate estate of the deceased Lu Villalon for his\u00a0 approval, that fishpond forming\u00a0 part of said estate. action taken by reason of that compromise and the proceedings for the approval thereof are\u00a0 closely connected\u00a0 with\u00a0 the special proceedings alluded to and even form a part thereof, and therefore the judge who presided at them is\u00a0 the\u00a0 only one competent to know the forms, terms, a conditions of that compromise and to issue\u00a0 the order\u00a0 for their\u00a0 approved as he\u00a0 did\u00a0 on March\u00a0 21,\u00a0 1910,\u00a0 nor is it correct that an ordinary case against third\u00a0 parties was tried in said special proceedings, for such a to be found in no part of the proceedings.<\/p><p>Finally,\u00a0 and\u00a0 especially\u00a0 because Remigia\u00a0 Hernandez's credit is compos sums accepted in life by the intestate Lucia Villalon and after her death taken by her heirs and by the administrator Leoncio Barcelon,\u00a0 when he h as such administrator undertaken and bound himself by means of a compromise\u00a0 to pay her in exchange for terminating the pending contract lease and selling the fishpond without objection\u00a0 by the lessee who was demanding that her rights be\u00a0 respected, an acknowledgment that would in itself be binding upon the purchaser and would have caused depreciation the estate at the auction, when the creditor Hernandez was\u00a0 careful to h to the terms and conditions of the said compromise for the collection of credit, even though she may\u00a0 not have appealed in time to the assessment commission.<\/p><p>For all the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 whereby the errors assigned to the\u00a0 order appealed from are held to be refuted, fulfillment of the compromise stipulated between the parties is in strict justice proper,\u00a0 and therefore be affirmed, as we do hereby affirm said orders appealed from, with the costs against the appellant.<\/p><p><em>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

It is therefore,  prayed in the complaint that the defendant be sentenced to restore to the plaintiff, in his capacity  of administrator of the said estate,  thel and in disute. to pay the indemnity mentioned of P4,000, and the costs of the trial.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant, in her answer to the complaint, denied that the  land  in controversy belongs  to the estate of Diego Tabotabo,  or that she had seized the same without having just and legitimate  title thereto, and alleged that  she was then in possession  of only one-half of the said land, inasmuch as the other half had been unlawfully detained by one Jose Veloso, since the year 1909.<\/p>\n<p>It is to be noted that the defendant is the widow of the deceased Diego Tabotabo, by his second marriage,  his first wife  having been one Teodosia Oliva.<\/p>\n<p>During the course of the trial, the defendant presented a motion to the court asking for the dismissal  of the case oh the grounds that, in the special probate proceedings relative to the estate of the deceased Fausto Tabotabo, a son of her husband Diego, she had filed a motion whereby she requested  that various property specified therein  be  adjudicated to her as her share of the property of the conjugal partnership which  existed between herself and the said Diego Tabotabo,  and that, since the land here  in question was a part of that property, any  ruling whatsoever that might be made on the said motion would necessarily affect the rights  in controversy  in the present case.<\/p>\n<p>The court denied the said motion for the dismissal of this case, but,  at the same time, ordered that  the motion presented by the defendant in the special proceedings aforementioned  be made a part of the present trial record.  The hearing of  both cases was, therefore, had at one and the same time and  were jointly decided in the same judgment.<\/p>\n<p>The dispositive part of that judgment is as follows:<\/p>\n<p>For all of the foregoing reasons, the court absolves the defendant ftom the complaint and the costs of the trial and orders that a  duplicate of this judgment be attached to the record of the special probate proceedings had in connection with the estate of the deceased Diego Tabotabo, as a ruling on the motion of Gregorio Molero, of the date of June 15, 1908, whereby a separation is requested of one-half of the property above mentioned, and, therefore, it is finally  ordered that one-half of the aforementioned  property be adjudicated in ownership, use, enjoyment and possession, to Gregoria Molero.\"<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff appealed from that judgment to this court.<\/p>\n<p>After  an examination of the evidence,  we believe  that it is preponderatingly in favor of the plaintiff, in so far as it concerns the land described and claimed in the complaint. The only issue  raised with regard to that  land  is as to whether  it belonged to' the conjugal partnership between the defendant and Diego Tabotabo, or whether it was exclusively owned  by the latter, as contended by the plaintiff. Now, besides the documentary evidence presented by Gaudencio Tabotabo, which  tends to prove that the said  land belonged exclusively to Diego  Tabotabo,  there  is the testimony of the defendant herself that corroborates the fact of such exclusive ownership.  She explicitly and positively testified that the land in dispute was acquired by the latter during his first marriage, although the improvements thereon (the coconut trees) were made during his marriage  with her, the  defendant.  According to  this, the acquisition of the said  land was made prior to the  latter's marriage to Diego  Tabotabo  who, therefore, was the owner of the same and  brought it  to  the  said marriage  as  property  of his own.   This being so, it  is evident  that the said land was the separate and exclusive property  of  Diego Tabotabo, pursuant to article  1396 of the Civil Code, which  provides as follows:<\/p>\n<p><em>\"Property belonging to each of the spouses.<\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"1. That  brought to  the marriage  as his or her  own *    *    *.\"<br\/>\n<br\/>\n  The improvements made on  the said  land,  consisting, as they do, of groves of coconut-trees, also belong by right of accession to  the owner of the  land, that is, to Diego Tabotabo.<\/p>\n<p>\"Ownership of property  gives a right by accession to all that is produced thereby or which  is  united to or incorporated therein naturally or artificially.\"   (Art. 353, Civil Code.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In accordance with this principle, article 358 of the same code expressly declares  that\u2014 <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Whatever is constructed, planted, or sown on another's property,  and the improvements or repairs made thereon, belongs to the owner of the same  *  *  *.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The provision just above quoted has an exception in th$ case of conjugal partnership property, when the same consists of buildings, for the second paragraph.of article 1404 provides that <em>\"buildings<\/em> constructed during the marriage, on land belonging to  one of the spouses, shall also belong to the partnership, but the value of the land shall be paid to the spouse owning  the same.\"  However, this exception is limited only to buildings and does not  apply to crops, such as are concerned in this case, with respect to which the general rule governs, viz, that what is accessory belongs to what is principal  and  is for the benefit of  the owner of the latter.<\/p>\n<p>The foregoing  statements have reference to the ownership of the actual improvements or crops,  which lies with the owner of the land whereon the latter are, who, in the present case, is  Diego Tabotabo; for, as  regards the disbursements or expenses made to produce the said improvements, such expenditures are of the nature of partnership property and the conjugal partnership must, therefore, be reimbursed for them.   (First paragraph of art. 1404, above cited.)  But, since in the case at bar the sole issue is the ownership of the  land in question  and its improvements, and  the liquidation of  the conjugal partnership between the defendant and Diego Tabotabo is not concerned, there is no  reason for our making any finding whatever  with respect to the said expenses.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, as the present suit was not brought for the liquidation of the conjugal partnership, it would be improper in this decision to adjudicate  any part whatever of the property held by such partnership, to the defendant as her share of the same, as is done in  the judgment appealed from, with respect to the property  specified in the motion presented by the said defendant in  the special proceedings concerning the estate left by  Fausto Tabotabo, a son of Diego who was the predecessor in interest of the estate represented by the  plaintiff.   It  appears that the trial  judge only took into  account that the property referred to was acquired during the marriage of Diego Tabotabo  with  the defendant.  This fact,  however,  is not sufficient in itself  to determine a priori the real  and actual share of each one of the spouses in the said property, especially as the trial disclosed the probability of the existence of debts which perhaps may affect the property in question. It is  possible that those debts may  be personal ones encumbering Diego Tabotabo's own private property,  and that the conjugal partnership may not be liable for them; but this question can not be incidentally decided here.  The proper  procedure for that purpose would be that whereby a liquidation of the conjugal  partnership would have  to be made and which  might  well  be  the  special proceedings in  the matter of the estate of Diego Tabotabo.  Without there first being a liquidation of the said partnership, which must be made subject to the provisions  of articles 1418 to 1431 of the Civil Code, it can not be known whether or not there  are any net assets or, therefore, any property divisible between the  spouses, as conjugal property,  nor what  is the exact amount of the share that may belong  to each of the latter.  As it does not appear that such a liquidation was effected, it follows that the adjudication in a final manner made in behalf of the defendant, of a certain part of the property declared  to be conjugal property  in the judgment appealed from, is at least premature.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is set aside,  in so far  as it orders the adjudication to the defendant of one-half  of the said property, as  conjugal partnership property, the right  being reserved to the parties to bring such action or actions, in due legal manner and form, as may be proper  in this matter; and the said judgment is  reversed in the part thereof  which absolves the defendant  from the  complaint, who is hereby sentenced to restore to the plaintiff,  in his capacity of administrator of the estate of Diego Tabotabo, such part of  the land claimed in the complaint as is  in the possession of the said defendant, without obligation on the latter's part, however, to restore the products collected from the said land, which, as a possessor in good faith, she has legitimately acquired.   No special  condemnation is made of the costs of either instance.   So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano,  C.

Affidavits to that effect are offered, and the order allowing the writ purports to do so on affidavits of the plaintiff and two others, \"notwithstanding the fact that, by admission of counsel for plaintiff, it appears that the value of the parcel of land for which judgment was rendered in favor of the defendant municipality, exclusive of the value of the adjoining parcel of land with the church and convent situated thereon, title to which is recognized to be in the plaintiff, and damages thereto resulting from the aforesaid judgment, does not exceed $25,000.\" We doubt whether the affidavits do not imply the same admission, and whether the action should not be dismissed on that ground. The affidavit of the plaintiff puts the value of the land in controversy at over $25,000 on the manifestly untenable ground that the church edifices are deprived of free egress and ingress by the decision, and the other seemingly mean that the parcel of land with the church buildings included is worth $30,000, the buildings being valued at $25,000, leaving $5,000 for the land in dispute.<\/p><p>But the result is the same if we go further. The evidence was contradictory, and although we were invited to consider it on the one side in the light of the relation of the church to the community, and on the other in that of the custom by which the <em>plaza<\/em> is of the essence of a town, we can do neither. There is no question of law before us, for it hardly was argued, and could not be with any seriousness, that the supreme court was not authorized to review the evidence under article 497 of the Philippine Code, or that this court can consider whether it was right in finding the preponderance of evidence to be on the defendant's side.<\/p><p><em>Appeal and writ of error dismissed<\/em>.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><br\/><\/p><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 226 U.

The road was crowded with people by reason of the steamer's arrival, but still said Agustin yelled at his bull and made the animal run, with the result that one of the pedestrians, an old man named Melecio Navarro, was knocked down and one wheel of the cart passed over him; and in spite of the assistance immediately rendered him he died within an hour.<br\/><br\/>Complaint was filed in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte by the provincial fiscal, charging Fernando Agustin with the crime of homicide by reckless negligence, and the court, on July 23, 1910, sentenced him to the penalty of a year and a day of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, with the accessories of article 61, to pay P1,000 indemnity to the heirs of the deceased, and to the costs; from which judgment the defendant's counsel appealed.<br\/><br\/>\"He who shall execute through reckless negligence an act that, if done with malice, would constitute a grave crime, shall be punished with the penalty of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its maximum degree to <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum degree, and with <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its minimum and medium degrees if it shall constitute a less grave crime.\" (Art. 568, Penal Code.)<br\/><br\/>It was fully proven at the trial, by the testimony of eyewitnesses, that the defendant was riding a bull drawing a loaded cart and that he began to yell at the animal so that it started to run fast along the road through the town and port of Currimao in the direction of Paoay, although he had seen that this road was filled with people owing to the arrival of the steamer from Cagayan. In so doing he was guilty of reckless negligence, for, in spite of the noise made by the cart and his yells, he struck the old man, Melecio Navarro, who was run over and died an hour afterwards.<br\/><br\/>We must conclude from the trial that, in making his bull run, the defendant acted without malice or intention of hurting the people who were walking along the road, but still in so doing he might have seen that, because of the crowd of people in the road, he was likely to hurt some one, as in fact he did do serious damage by causing a death, which, if he had acted with malice, would have constituted the crime of homicide. This occurred because he did not drive the animal with care and caution, and therefore it is unquestionable that he caused the death of Melecio Navarro through reckless negligence, as it was not shown at the trial that he acted with the malicious intention of killing the victim.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Fernando Agustin is responsible before the law for what happened, for the very reason that he carelessly, negligently, imprudently, and with genuine recklessness excited his bull so as to make it run among the people walking along the said road, thereby becoming liable to do serious damage, as happened in the case of one of the pedestrians, whose death may have deprived a family of its sole protection and support. The defendant pleaded not guilty, but in spite of his denial and his unsubstantiated allegations in his own defense, the case as a whole furnishes conclusive proof of his guilt. It does not appear that the people assembled at the scene of the accident made any noise to frighten the animal and make it run away, or that the cord for guiding it was broken, while two eye-witnesses who testified under oath at the trial refute the evidence of the defendant by declaring that when the latter mounted upon the bull he began to excite the animal to make it run fast and continued to yell while it was running and until the old man Navarro was knocked down. The defendant does not seem to have been in the cart but was mounted on the bull, driving it with a cord that served as a rein, and even if this cord had broken he would not have been able to stop the animal in obedience to the signal made to him by a policeman who appeared on the scene later and chased the cart which had afterwards continued on its way some distance.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 3 of said article 568 provides that, in imposing the penalty the defendant has incurred as perpetrator of homicide by reckless negligence, the courts are not bound by the regulations prescribed in article 81 of the Penal Code but that they shall use their discretion; therefore it is held that the penalty imposed upon the defendant is in accordance with law.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned on appeal have been refuted, it is our opinion that the judgment should be and it is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the defendant; and provided, further, that, in case of insolvency for the indemnity, he be sentenced to subsidiary imprisonment not to exceed one-third of the principal penalty.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

the husband led the way and opened the door; he was followed by his wife who,\u00a0 once inside,\u00a0 lit a match\u00a0 and t a small kerosene lamp there was in the house.\u00a0 In the meantime the husbant approached\u00a0 the\u00a0 place where Genoveva was, who, startled, immediately awoke, seized a pocketknife used in spinning hemp, which was in a box at her side, and with it attacked and struck Bautista, who was near her, a in the breast; thereupon her sister Maria,\u00a0 who was not aware of the aggression, asked Genoveva why\u00a0 empty tin cans and other articles were scattered about the azotea of the house,\u00a0 to which Genoveva replied by saying:\u00a0 \"What! have you arrived already?\"\u00a0 and at once got up in front the said spouses; at this moment Maria advised her to cogitate and reflex but Genoveva immediately ran out of the house, asking for help; it was t that the wife noticed that her husband was seriously wounded, and when h was afterwards examined by a physician it was ascertained that he bore a downward, penetrating wound, in the shape of a T, in the intercostal\u00a0 space between the second and third ribs of the left side, that it reached one the\u00a0 lungs and the heart, was necessarily fatal,\u00a0 and\u00a0 was inflicted wit sharp-pointed, cutting\u00a0 instrument.\u00a0 A few moments after its infliction injured man\u00a0 died.<\/p><p>By reason of the foregoing, an information was filed in the Court of Fir Instance of Batangas, on January 8,1912, by the provincial fiscal, charge Genoveva Apego with the crime of murder, and upon the institution of thi case the aforementioned judgment was rendered.<\/p><p>We accept the classification of homicide given by\u00a0 the trial judge to th facts involving the\u00a0 violent death of Pio Bautista, since, in the commission the\u00a0 crime, it does not appear that there was present any of the qualify circumstances that determine a more serious crime and penalty.<\/p><p>It is unquestionable and beyond all doubt that Genoveva Apego, an unmarried woman of about 25 years\u00a0 of\u00a0 age, inflicted upon the deceased with a pocketknife a\u00a0 serious wound of a necessarily mortal nature, for died\u00a0 shortly afterwards.\u00a0 This wound penetrated the\u00a0 left nipple, extended between the second and third ribs of the same\u00a0 side from an upper toward a\u00a0 lower and\u00a0 an outward toward an inner direction and reached the heart and one of the lungs.<\/p><p>The record does not show whether the deceased was\u00a0 able to make any <em> ante-mortem<\/em> statement, nor does it appear to have been ascertained what\u00a0 was the motive of the fatal aggression of which the said Pio Bautista was the victim.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 following\u00a0 conclusions\u00a0 of\u00a0 fact are\u00a0 derived\u00a0 from a careful study this case: upon the arrival of Maria Apego and her husband, Pio Bautista the stairs of their house, and as Genoveva Apego did not reply to the ca made to her from the outside by her sister Maria, the said spouses went the upper floor of the\u00a0 house;\u00a0 Bautista led the way\u00a0 and, in order to e opened the outside door, a sliding door, and as there was no light insid stumbled against Genoveva Apego, who was sleeping near the said door, and touched her left arm; thereupon, Genoveva awoke and believing, as sh testified,\u00a0 that somebody\u00a0 was trying to\u00a0 abuse her, seized the pocketkn aforementioned, asking at the\u00a0 same time who was\u00a0 beside her,\u00a0 and as sh did not receive\u00a0 a reply immediately, she got up and struck the person before her a blow with the said knife; in the meanwhile Maria Apego had separated from her husband to\u00a0 light a match and then a kerosene lamp there was in the house and was not aware of the assault made upon her husband by her sister, and\u00a0 only when the\u00a0 light had been lit did she se sister Genoveva in front of Bautista,\u00a0 who had already been wounded\u00a0 and was in an attitude indicating that\u00a0 he was about to fall to the floor; thereupon Genoveva went down out of the house, calling for help, and ran to the house of an\u00a0 aunt\u00a0 of\u00a0 hers where she was arrested by the policeman, Manuel Peinado, to whom she then and there delivered the pocketknife with which she had assaulted her brother-in-law.<\/p><p>In view of the shape and direction of the wound received by the deceased and the part of the body where it was inflicted, according: to the detail report of the medical examination, it is unquestionable that the wound w inflicted by the defendant after she had arisen from the place where she had been sleeping, or, at least, when she had raised up in a sitting\u00a0 posture or was seated on the floor,\u00a0 at the time that the deceased perhaps stooped over, in stumbling against her, and touched her left arm; but in manner may it be presumed that she assaulted her brother-in-law, Bautista while she was still lying on the floor of the house; such\u00a0 a presumption precluded by a consideration of the direction the weapon took in penetrating the deceased's breast.<\/p><p>Maria Apego\u00a0 testified that, during the two years her sister Genoveva lived their house,\u00a0 the\u00a0 latter had conducted herself correctly, that they had always gotten along well and harmoniously together and had never had the least misunderstanding between them.\u00a0 The record does not show whether there had been any trouble or there\u00a0 existed any resentment\u00a0 between the defendant and the deceased who, before he died and during the few moments he lived after he\u00a0 was wounded,\u00a0 made no statement whatever relative to this point or\u00a0 to the conduct observed by the defendant with respect to the assault of which he was\u00a0 the\u00a0 victim, and, therefore, the defendant's testimony must be accepted, to\u00a0 wit, that she\u00a0 struck a blow with the\u00a0 pocketknife at the person\u00a0 beside her, and who\u00a0 afterwards turn out to be\u00a0 her brother-in-law, Pio Bautista, without knowing who he\u00a0 was and in the belief\u00a0 that,\u00a0 since\u00a0 he\u00a0 touched\u00a0 her left arm, he was about commit an attempt against her honor.<\/p><p>Under this\u00a0 hypothesis, it can\u00a0 not be denied that, upon the defendant's awakening,\u00a0 startled at feeling somebody grasp her left arm and believing that an attempt was being made against her honor, as she received no reply whatever to her Question as to who was beside her in the darkness the house,\u00a0 she understood that\u00a0 there was a positive unlawful aggression from which she had to defend\u00a0 herself with the said pocketknife, and it also\u00a0 undeniable that there was no previous provocation on her part; but is unquestionable that, in making use of this deadly weapon, even in the defense of her person and rights, by decidedly wounding him who had touched her or caught her by the arm,\u00a0 the defendant exceeded her right of defense, since there was no real need of wounding with the said weapon him who had merely caught her by the arm,\u00a0 and perhaps did so to awake her, as she was asleep and had not replied to her sister's calls; and as party who she believed was making\u00a0 an attempt\u00a0 against\u00a0 her\u00a0 honor, because he had caught her by the arm, performed no other act of aggression such as might indicate\u00a0 a decided purpose to commit an attempt against her honor than merely to catch her by the arm, and although the defendant believed that it was the commencement of such an attempt and that she had to defend herself therefrom,\u00a0 it is true that, once awake a provided, with an effective weapon for\u00a0 her\u00a0 defense, there was no just reasonable cause for striking a blow therewith in the\u00a0 center of the bod where\u00a0 the principal vital organs are seated, of the man who had not performed any act\u00a0 which might be considered as\u00a0 an actual attempt against her honor.<\/p><p>From\u00a0 the\u00a0 foregoing considerations it is concluded that in the commission the crime there was present the circumstance of incomplete exemption fro responsibility, as all the three\u00a0 requisites specified in subarticle\u00a0 4 of the Penal\u00a0 Code are not applicable; wherefore the criminal\u00a0 act\u00a0 is altogether\u00a0 excusable,\u00a0 on account\u00a0 of the lack of the second of the said requisites, although a majority of them were present, that\u00a0 is,\u00a0 the\u00a0 first the third requisites; and, therefore,\u00a0 in accordance with the provisions article 86 of the code,\u00a0 a penalty lower by one or two degrees than that prescribed by article 404 of the code, in the discretion of the court, m imposed upon the defendant.<\/p><p>In view of the fact that the accused is an ignorant woman, wholly uneducated, and that it was not shown that, at the time when she assault the\u00a0 deceased,\u00a0 she knew that he was her brother-in-law, account must\u00a0 b taken of the circumstance prescribed by article 11 of the code, in conne with Act No. 2142, as no aggravating circumstance whatever was present t counteract the\u00a0 effects\u00a0 of the said extenuating circumstance; therefore penalty applicable to the defendant is\u00a0 the one lower by\u00a0 two degrees an in the minimum period.<br\/><\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons it is our opinion that, with a reversal of\u00a0 the judgment appealed\u00a0 from, the defendant, Genoveva Apego, should be, as she is hereby,\u00a0 sentenced to the penalty of two\u00a0 years of <em> prision correccional<\/em>, to the accessories of article 61, to pay an indemnity hundred pesos to the heirs of the deceased, and, in case of insolvency, subsidiary imprisonment which shall\u00a0 not exceed one-third of the principal penalty, and to the payment of the costs of both instances.\u00a0\u00a0 In computing the time of the sentence, credit shall\u00a0 be allowed\u00a0 for\u00a0 one-half of the of imprisonment suffered by\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant while awaiting trial.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em> Arellano, C.

The court says that\u00a0 in the absence\u00a0 of\u00a0 any evidence showing resentment existing between the deceased and\u00a0 the accused, her testimony to the eff that she believed an attempt was being made against her honor must be believed.\u00a0 I fail\u00a0 to\u00a0 see\u00a0 what possible bearing\u00a0 resentment entertainement the accused toward the deceased would have.\u00a0 She did not recognize her assailant until after\u00a0 the light had\u00a0 been\u00a0 struck.\u00a0 The identity of\u00a0 the deceased\u00a0 did not enter\u00a0 into her belief that she was about to be raped. Had her assailant been her worst enemy she would not have known\u00a0 it\u00a0 until after the harm had been done. But\u00a0 the facts of the case conclusively sh that? the accused entertained\u00a0 no resentment toward the deceased.\u00a0 The wife\u00a0 of the deceased testified that her sister had lived in the house f long time and that she and her\u00a0 sister\u00a0 had always been on the most amicable\u00a0 of terms.\u00a0 After\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused became aware of the identity of the deceased she made not the slightest\u00a0 move to continue her attack or defense.\u00a0\u00a0 I therefore agree with the conclusion of the court\u00a0 but with reservation\u00a0 that the testimony of the defendant\u00a0 that she struck the b under\u00a0 the impression that she\u00a0 was about to become the victim of an unchaste assault must\u00a0 be accepted as true. If the defendant believed th she was subjected to\u00a0 such an unlawful\u00a0 attack,\u00a0 the question arises, was such\u00a0 a belief excusable under the\u00a0 circumstances? <br\/><\/p><blockquote><p>\"The party killing, to justify, must have reasonable apprehension or f death or serious bodily harm, at the time of the killing.\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 But whom must\u00a0 the appearance of danger the apprehension of the party killing\u00a0\u00a0 reasonably appear?\u00a0 To\u00a0 the jury after hearing\u00a0 all the evidence after ascertaining the real facts?\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 Or, must the\u00a0 real or apparent danger appear to the defendant ,at\u00a0 the time of the homicide to be reasonable?\u00a0\u00a0 We think the latter correct.\u00a0 The jury must view the facts his standpoint.\u00a0 Each juror\u00a0 must place\u00a0 himself in\u00a0 the position of the defendant at the time\u00a0 of the homicide,\u00a0 and determine from all the fact as they appeared to\u00a0 defendant at the time of the killing, whether his apprehension or fear of death or serious bodily harm was reasonable;\u00a0 an if so, they should acquit.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Bell <em>vs<\/em>.

The court does not expressly state its views on this branch of the case. understand, however, that the sentence of conviction is based upon the theory that the accused exercised her right of self-defense to a disproportionate degree.\u00a0 At least such would be gathered from the following language:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"*\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 and\u00a0 although the\u00a0 defendant believed that it was the commencement of such art attempt and that she had to defend herself therefrom, it is true that, once awake and provided with an effective weapon\u00a0 for her defense, there was no just\u00a0 nor reasonable cause for str a blow therewith in the center of the\u00a0 body,\u00a0 where the principal vital are seated, of the man who had not performed any act which might be considered as an actual attempt against her honor.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>As a matter of\u00a0 fact, the acts of the deceased\u00a0 were perfectly harmless. There was, as\u00a0 a matter of law, based upon those actual facts, no unlawful aggression.\u00a0 Based upon those actual facts of the case,\u00a0 there was no excuse whatever for the homicide.\u00a0 Based upon those actual facts, the\u00a0 c of homicide\u00a0 was committed with\u00a0 several aggravating circumstances.\u00a0 The court, however, has imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment and accessories.\u00a0 I must therefore believe that the\u00a0 court\u00a0 has tacitly, at adopted the view\u00a0 of the case that the sentence of conviction should be predicated upon the following operative facts: A would be ravisher approached the\u00a0 accused in\u00a0 the house where she was sleeping alone, etc. exercising her\u00a0 right of self-defense,\u00a0 she exceeded\u00a0 the limits of reasonable resistance against her\u00a0 assailant.\u00a0 In this view of the case, the question as to whether a\u00a0 woman may ever go so far in defense\u00a0 of\u00a0 her chastity as\u00a0 to kill her assailant, and if so, whether such extreme action was warranted in view of the\u00a0 circumstances\u00a0 as they presented themselves to accused at the\u00a0 time she killed the deceased.\u00a0 To the first part of this question the answer must be, yes.\u00a0 In repulsing a felonious\u00a0 attack a person may go as far in his self-defense as may\u00a0 reasonably\u00a0 be necessary, view the circumstances\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 case\u00a0 from his point of view.\u00a0 The books are of\u00a0 cases where this principle has been applied; but it is doubtful\u00a0 if may be found where the victim\u00a0 of an attempted\u00a0 rape was tried for\u00a0 the murder of her assailant.\u00a0 In the case of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Santa (22\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 249), this court, <em>in\u00a0 banc<\/em>, said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"When a man becomes so debased as to lose every instinct of manhood and engages himself in the commission of so serious a crime (rape), he certainly takes his life and liberty in his own hands, and if he\u00a0 loses latter or receives serious personal injuries, his\u00a0 loss is\u00a0 no greater t deserves.\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant is therefore entitled to an absolute acquittal the ground of self-defense.\" <br\/><\/p><\/blockquote><p>As to the second part of\u00a0 the question, it\u00a0 is necessary to again view t circumstances of the case as they appeared to the appellant at the time struck\u00a0 the blow with the knife.\u00a0 The court is of the opinion that she w not justified in striking that blow because it says the man \"had not performed any act which might be considered as an actual attempt against her honor.\"\u00a0\u00a0 This statement is inexplicable. The only\u00a0 acts\u00a0 which the deceased performed\u00a0 at all were those of stumbling against her body and touching her left arm,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the court\u00a0 had already arrived at the conclusion that the woman believed an\u00a0 attack was being made\u00a0 against her honor. In other words, the attempt\u00a0 had progressed to the point\u00a0 where her assailant had come in physical\u00a0 contact with\u00a0 her.\u00a0\u00a0 Due either to willful or negligence, he did not reassure\u00a0 her as he should have done\u00a0 by answering her inquiry as to who he\u00a0 was.\u00a0 He Was not merely standing at distance threatening her or making indecent gestures.\u00a0 She was alone in house.\u00a0 There was no possible way of retreat.\u00a0 Her physical inferiority be\u00a0 conceded.\u00a0 In an other instant he would have grasped her by the arm and thus prevented her from using the\u00a0 knife at all.\u00a0 Was\u00a0 this the time temporize, to threaten, to plead for mercy, or to strike half-heartedly weapon which would be useless to her in another moment of time?\u00a0\u00a0 The court would have\u00a0\u00a0 had her select a less\u00a0 vital\u00a0 part of the body for th blow; this in the darkness and most probably without being able to distinguish even the outlines of the human being who had attacked her. would have called for deliberation and\u00a0 cool\u00a0 and discriminating <em>but <\/em> action.\u00a0 Every indication points to the fact that she struck wildly while not yet fully awake, and, by the\u00a0 merest chance, with fatal result<\/p><p>In the case of United States vs. Ah Chong (15 Phil.

About 10 o'clock on\u00a0 tha night Ah Chong was suddenly awakened by some one trying to force open the door of the room.\u00a0\u00a0 He called out,\u00a0 \"Who is\u00a0 there?\"\u00a0 Receiving\u00a0 no reply, he said:\u00a0 \"If you enter the room I will kill you.\" He then seized and went to the door, which was suddenly pushed open, and Gualberto entered.\u00a0 It was\u00a0 very dark in the room.\u00a0 Ah Chong struct out wildly at intruder, and\u00a0 inflicted blows\u00a0 upon Gualberto which very shortly thereafter resulted\u00a0 in his death.\u00a0\u00a0 Ah\u00a0 Chong thought the intruder\u00a0 was,a\u00a0 ladr He was tried for the killing\u00a0 of Gualberto and found guilty\u00a0 of homicide sentenced to six years and one day of <em>presidio mayor.<\/em>\u00a0\u00a0 Upon appe he was acquitted.\u00a0 This court said, pp. 492, 493 :\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Under these\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 (Art. 8, Penal Code)\u00a0 we think that there can doubt that defendant would be entitled to complete\u00a0 exemption from criminal liability for the death of the victim of his fatal blow, if the who forced open the door of his room had been in fact a dangerous thief or <em>ladron<\/em> as the defendant believed him\u00a0 to be.<\/p><\/blockquote><p align=\"center\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"But the evidence clearly discloses that the intruder was not a thief or l<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">adron<\/span>.\u00a0 That nether the defendant nor his property nor any of the property under his charge was in real danger at the time when he struck fatal blow.\u00a0 That there was no such\u00a0 'unlawful aggression' on the part o thief or <em>ladron<\/em> as\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 believed\u00a0 he was\u00a0 repelling and re and that there was no real 'necessity' for the use of the knife to\u00a0 defe his person or\u00a0 his property or he property under his charge.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In this case a strong man, Ah Chong,\u00a0 was acquitted for killing his frie upon the ground that he believed that the intruder was a thief or a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ladron<\/span> seeking entrance for the purpose of larceny or robbery.\u00a0 In the case at a woman is convicted because she exceeded\u00a0 the means\u00a0 necessary to defend her honor.\u00a0 Had she stated that she believed that the person who touched her arm had entered for the purpose of larceny or robbery,\u00a0\u00a0 the two cases would have been, <em>mutatis mutandis,<\/em> identical;\u00a0 and under former,\u00a0 if the court had followed the doctrine laid down\u00a0 in that case, would have been acquitted.\u00a0 But as she was defending her honor she has been convicted.\u00a0 The court squarely places the loss of the property in t former case above the loss of the honor and virtue of a woman in the latter case.\u00a0 To my mind there is no comparison between the gravity of t two offenses.

In sup of this contention reference is made to a decision of the supreme court Spain wherein\u00a0 that court, in discussing the penalty to be imposed\u00a0 on convicted of homicide, held that\u00a0 the generic aggravating circumstance o alevosia\u00a0 (treachery)\u00a0 should\u00a0 not be taken into consideration \"beca really exists, it increases the penal responsibility \" by\u00a0 converting th into murder; and\u00a0 if it is not sufficiently\u00a0 proved, for\u00a0 the same reaso it is rejected as constituent it must be rejected as generic, for that w legally unjustified\u00a0 cannot in any way be regarded\u00a0 as\u00a0 aggravating.\" (V Penal Code, VoL I, p. 253.)\u00a0 But this comment of the supreme court of Sp is to be construed with reference to the judicial system\u00a0 of procedure force in the jurisdiction\u00a0 wherein it was made.\u00a0 Under that system, if proof had been sufficient to establish\u00a0 the existence of the\u00a0 attendant circumstance <em>alevosia<\/em>,\u00a0 it would have been\u00a0 the duty of the court convict the defendant of the crime of asesinato (murder); and what the court really held was, that in tfhe case then under consideration, alevo (treachery) had not been proven, and\u00a0 for that\u00a0 sufficient reason could be taken into consideration either as a qualifying circumstance (<em>circ cualificativa<\/em>)\u00a0 or\u00a0 as a generic aggravating circumstance.<\/p><p>Under our Penal\u00a0 Code, the penalty prescribed for the offenses defined therein must be imposed\u00a0 in a more severe degree, within the prescribed when it appears that the commission\u00a0 of those offenses\u00a0 is attended by one or more of the generic\u00a0 aggravating circumstances expressly set\u00a0 out chapter 4\u00a0 book\u00a0 1 of the Code:\u00a0 and we have uniformly held that, although the information contains no allegation as to\u00a0 the fact that the commission of the crime charged was marked with one\u00a0 or more\u00a0 of\u00a0 these generic aggravating circumstances, nevertheless that fact may be proven the trial, and, if proven, must\u00a0 be taken into consideration in imposing penalty.<\/p><p>This rule of practice is justified on the ground that the introduction o evidence is admitted only for the purpose of showing the precise manner which the\u00a0 offense actually charged in the complaint was committed; and not for the purpose of changing the legal characterization or designatio the offense charged in the information, or of showing that the offense committed was in fact a\u00a0 higher offense than that charged in the information.\u00a0\u00a0 It follows, of course, that proof of the existence of one more aggravating circumstances not expressly charged\u00a0 in the complaint and\u00a0 should serve no other purpose\u00a0 than that of aiding the court in determining whether the penalty should be imposed in a more or less seve form, within the limits prescribed for the offense charged in the compla information.<\/p><p>Proof that the commission of an offense charged in the complaint or information was marked by an\u00a0 aggravating circumstance not mentioned therein should not and will not be denied its logical and normal effect increasing\u00a0 the severity of the penalty to be imposed within the limits prescribed by law for that offense, on the sole ground that,\u00a0 had the aggravating\u00a0 circumstance been set\u00a0 forth\u00a0 in the complaint\u00a0 or\u00a0 informa proof of its\u00a0 existence\u00a0 would have justified the treatment of that circumstance as\u00a0 a qualifiying circumstance, and the conviction of the a of a higher offense than that actually charged.<\/p><p>As throwing\u00a0 some light on this\u00a0 holding,\u00a0 attention is directed to\u00a0 the that, when a conviction\u00a0 is had on a complaint or information charging t crime of assassination, and it\u00a0 appears that the unlawful taking of the of another was marked with two or more of the above, set out circumstances, any one of which is sufficient to qualify the crime as th assassination, then\u00a0 under the practice of this\u00a0 court, adhering to\u00a0 the practice\u00a0 established\u00a0 in the supreme\u00a0 court of Spain, any one of these circumstances may be treated as the qualifying circumstance which raises crime to that of assassination, and the others are then treated as gener aggravating\u00a0 circumstances to be taken into consideration in\u00a0 determinin degree\u00a0 of severity with which the penalty prescribed for that crime sho be imposed.<\/p><p>Since the\u00a0 existence of this\u00a0 aggravating\u00a0 circumstance alone, in\u00a0 the a of proof of\u00a0 any extenuating circumstance, is sufficient to sustain the of the trial court in imposing the\u00a0 penalty in\u00a0 its maximum degree,\u00a0 it necessary for us to consider the questions which have been raised as\u00a0 to existence or nonexistence of other aggravating\u00a0 circumstances.<\/p><p>The judgment of the court below convicting the defendant and appellant o the crime of homicide with which he was charged,\u00a0 marked with the aggravating circumstance\u00a0 of alevosia,\u00a0 and sentencing him therefor is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

The provincial fisc agreed that \"in order for the Chinaman Po Chengco to get up into the kitchen where the fire originated he had to pass along Calle Manalili, l the shop and going along Calle Manalili and thence ascending to his own kitchen.\"\u00a0 The witness Digamo. further testified: That anybody could go into Po\u00a0 Chengco's kitchen, for its door\u00a0 was always\u00a0 open; that this kitchen was\u00a0 usually closed at\u00a0 10\u00a0 p.\u00a0 m.; that\u00a0 before\u00a0 10 o'clock anybody who wanted to go up into the kitchen could do so.\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q. You stated that before the fire you saw the defendant go toward the kitchen, did you see the defendant go up the stairway\u00a0 to, the kitchen? I\u00a0 did not really see that the defendant Po Chengco ascended the stairway but I saw that he went toward the\u00a0 kitchen; I was inside the shop.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. You never left\u00a0 the\u00a0 shop, you\u00a0 were always\u00a0 in\u00a0 the shop before and after the fire? - A. I didn't leave, I left when they took me (arrested police).\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. Not having left the shop, how could you see that your master Po Chengco was going toward the kitchen? -\u00a0 A. Because he turned toward Calle Manalili and our kitchen is there.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. And then you kept him in sight from the shop? - A. Yes, sir; I kept in sight and saw the defendant turn the corner of Manalili.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. Then you knew that the fire was going to occur? -\u00a0 A. No.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. As you were in the shop on the night of the fire, didn't you notice whence your master came when he entered the shop, as you say? - A. No.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Q. Then you merely supposed that he came from the kitchen? - A.\u00a0 Yes, s because when I said that my master left our shop going toward the kitchen it was\u00a0 because he turned into\u00a0 Calle\u00a0 Manalili where we have our\u00a0 kitchen just as when he returned he came from the same street.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The court made an ocular inspection of the place of the occurrence, drew sketch thereof, and in its decision gave the result of that search.\u00a0 It says:<br\/><\/p><blockquote><p>\"Opening upon said Calle Manalili is a stairway without a door, whereby possible to ascend from the street and immediately to enter the back kit that of the Chinaman\u00a0 Sy Japco.\u00a0\u00a0 In order to\u00a0 get from Sy Japco's kitch to that of the\u00a0 other Chinaman it is necessary to go through a door that can\u00a0 be fastened\u00a0 by\u00a0 a bar, but this door was open\u00a0 on the day in question; so it is evident that it was very\u00a0 easy for anybody to enter S Japco's kitchen\u00a0 from Calle Manalili and leave without being observed.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The Court of First Instance of Cebu classified the crime as frustrated and sentenced the defendant\u00a0 to\u00a0 eight years and one day of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prision mayor,<\/span> with the costs.\u00a0 The Attorney-General, in this instance, classifies crime as consummated\u00a0 arson\u00a0 and asks that the\u00a0 penalty be raised to sixteen years and one day of <em>cadena temporal<\/em>, the accessories of 56 and payment of the costs but since this penalty appears excessive in consideration of the insignificance of the damage done, he\u00a0 suggests application of article 2, paragraph 2, of the Penal Code.<\/p><p>The grounds for the classification\u00a0 as a frustrated crime Are:\u00a0 (1) \"Because real reason that the fire was not spread was the intervention of disinterested parties;\" (2) \"because\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant believed that this fire,\u00a0 started would be put out by the intervention of the passersby and other persons, on account of the time it\u00a0 took place, but it\u00a0 is no less true, that he others the frustration of\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime\u00a0 begun by him\" (p. 28).\u00a0\u00a0 The time took place was \"at 5 p. m., the time of the\u00a0 greatest crowds in the most frequented\u00a0 portions\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 town\"\u00a0\u00a0 (page\u00a0 25) \"*\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 and it is impossible to believe that a fire could have occurred in the whole house any part thereof because of the frequented place in which the house is situated and the crowded hour when the incident occurred, and so plain a evident is the fact that to the court it is impossible that\u00a0 the\u00a0 defend could\u00a0 have intended to\u00a0 burn the house, and this impossibility\u00a0 is much corroborated by\u00a0 the\u00a0 fact established without\u00a0 contradiction that the defendant's goods and articles in his\u00a0 shop carried very little insurance he would have lost at least 2,000 pesos by\u00a0 a fire,\u00a0 and if it is further added that \"the defendant had every opportunity to start a fire,\u00a0 had he so wished, during the night without\u00a0 being caught, it becomes\u00a0 very evident that the defendant's intention\u00a0 in the matter\u00a0 was not really to burn th house and shop in question\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\" (p. 26) \"*\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 but to\u00a0 arouse against\u00a0 Sy\u00a0 Japco the suspicion\u00a0 and\u00a0 charge of being an incendiary\" (p 27).<\/p><p>The following conclusions are, put forward as the basis for the convicti the defendant:<\/p><p>(1)\u00a0 \"That when Po Chengco dealt directly with Senor Pedro\u00a0 Cui,' said P Chengco estimated his rent\u00a0 at only 25 pesos a month, as his\u00a0 share for occupying his shop, while when Sy\u00a0 Japco became agent for\u00a0 Senor Cui, he charged Po\u00a0 Chengco the\u00a0 sum\u00a0 of 45 pesos\u00a0 a month, and because of this change\u00a0 bad feeling and enmity existed\u00a0 between the Chinaman Sy Japco and the\u00a0 defendant Po\u00a0 Chengco *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\"\u00a0 (p. 25).<\/p><p>(2)\u00a0 \"That on\u00a0 November\u00a0 18,\u00a0 19il, the defendant went to Sy Japco's kitchen, already described, and\u00a0 entering by the door on Calle Manalili ascending the stairway to said kitchen, he placed therein some pillows a sleeping mats and a few other rags, soaked in kerosene,\u00a0 and set fire to them,\u00a0 then immediately descending the stairway, but without being discovered by a servant of Sy Japco's\" (P. 25).<\/p><p>It\u00a0 is possible\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 essential\u00a0 errors\u00a0 discovered\u00a0 in the ground the\u00a0 decision,\u00a0 which are quoted\u00a0 literally for greater correctness, are an inexact translation and confusion of the names.<\/p><p>The first error in the conclusions set forth consists\u00a0 in taking as a pr that it was Sy Japco who substituted Po Chengco in the lease\u00a0 of the who property.\u00a0 It very\u00a0 clearly\u00a0 appears\u00a0 that\u00a0 it was Jao\u00a0 Chiaoco.\u00a0 He was asked (p.\u00a0 36):\u00a0 \"Explain to the\u00a0 court\u00a0 how you came\u00a0 to be the tenant Don Pedro\u00a0 Cui instead of Po Chengco,\" He explains\u00a0 it,\u00a0 concluding\u00a0 thus: *\u00a0 *\u00a0 and\u00a0 up\u00a0 to the present time\u00a0 I continue to\u00a0 deal only with Don Pe Cui for the whole house \" (p. 37).\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Q. When\u00a0 you took the\u00a0 place of Po Chengco how did you apportion the rent,, what did you have to pay and how much did you require from Po Chengco? - A.

No, I don't\"\u00a0 (p. 43).<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The second\u00a0 error consists\u00a0 in taking\u00a0 as\u00a0 a proven fact that the fire occurred\u00a0 in Sy\u00a0 Japco's kitchen.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 quite evident\u00a0 in the case that occurred in the\u00a0 kitchen of the three Chinamen, adjoining Sy Japco's.\u00a0 T witness Bejia says; \"I was in the shop of my master, Sy Japco, on the ni of the fire (p.\u00a0 52); I was the first to\u00a0 notice the fire; thinking that had occurred in the very kitchen of my master,\u00a0 I went upstairs, and it appeared\u00a0 that the fire started was\u00a0 in Po Chengco's\u00a0 kitchen; I was\u00a0 th first to rush to the place and exerted\u00a0 every effort to put out the fire 53); it was\u00a0 I who put it out,\u00a0 I alone, nobody came, although later the arrived\u00a0 but the fire was already put out\" (p. 54).<\/p><p>The third error consists in taking as a proven fact that the defendant w to the kitchen in which the\u00a0 fire occurred by ascending the stairway to kitchen and placing therein\u00a0 some pillows and sleeping mats soaked with kerosene and lighting them.<\/p><p>We have not found even the slightest proof that the defendant placed those objects, soaked them in kerosene\u00a0 and lighted them, in said kitchen The witness for\u00a0 the prosecution,\u00a0 Digamo,\u00a0 says: \"When I\u00a0 began\u00a0 to wor for\u00a0 my master\u00a0 as\u00a0 a cook these\u00a0 objects were already there, they were placed on a broken\u00a0 chair in the same kitchen; on the afternoon in quest they were there in the kitchen, they were not soaked in kerosene; after fire I did not again see them except in the\u00a0 municipal hall and then the smelled of kerosene\" (p. 66).\u00a0\u00a0 The other cook, Apolonio Magallanes, say same\u00a0 and adds that said\u00a0 articles\u00a0 belong to Po Chengco's servants.<\/p><p>There is no other pertinent evidence in this case which must be examined appeal to decide the defendant's responsibility, except the statements o witnesses for the prosecution, Bejia and Digamo,\u00a0 and those of the\u00a0 defeat the defendant himself and Sy Siong, and that of the witness for the prosecution, Sy Japco.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 statement of the\u00a0 witness\u00a0 Bernabe\u00a0 Digamo cannot support any conclusion\u00a0 regarding the guilt of the defendant. He states nothing with reference to the commission of the crime by the defendant.\u00a0 This witness merely\u00a0 says that he saw\u00a0 the\u00a0 latter leave the shop before\u00a0 the fire, t the corner in the\u00a0 direction of Calle Manalili, where the kitchen is loc return to the shop, while the fire\u00a0 occurred a little later;\u00a0 he did not all that he saw the defendant\u00a0 go\u00a0 up into the kitchen when he\u00a0 went toward\u00a0 Calle Manalili.\u00a0\u00a0 What he did\u00a0 say is that his assertion\u00a0 that t accused went\u00a0 toward the kitchen is a mere inference\u00a0 from the fact that the accused went toward Calle Manalili.\u00a0 It cannot be inferred from this that he was in the kitchen and that\u00a0 he there\u00a0 placed articles soaked in kerosene and lighted them.<\/p><p>Aside\u00a0 from the\u00a0 fact\u00a0 that this sole\u00a0 affirmation cannot support any conclusion\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 commission of the crime, the defendant and\u00a0 a witness testify\u00a0 regarding the meaning of said fact. The defendant states, and witness Sy\u00a0 Siong corroborates it, that if he\u00a0 then\u00a0 went\u00a0 toward Calle Manalili it was to get from Sy\u00a0 Japco's shop\u00a0 some toys that\u00a0 some people from\u00a0 Bohol were buying in\u00a0 his, and before the defendant had testified Japco\u00a0 had\u00a0 already made his statement, wherein he averred that the defendant had been\u00a0 in his shop three\u00a0 times on\u00a0 the afternoon of the occurrence, and when asked by the\u00a0 defense if \"that toy which Po Chengco bought\u00a0 on\u00a0 the 18th in\u00a0 his\u00a0 shop, had been bought on credit,\" he replied that it had.<\/p><p>The statement of Valeriano Bejia cannot support any conclusion regarding guilt\u00a0 of the accused.\u00a0\u00a0 In saying that when he rushed to\u00a0 put out the f he\u00a0 saw a\u00a0 man with\u00a0 gray hair\u00a0 descend\u00a0 the stairway,\u00a0 the inference does not necessarily follow that that man had been in the kitchen, and l that\u00a0 if he had been in the kitchen when the fire was\u00a0 started it was he who had caused\u00a0 it, and that the man with gray hair might be the accused and\u00a0 nobody else.\u00a0 Testimony of this\u00a0 kind\u00a0 is not sufficient to base a conviction upon.\u00a0 .<\/p><p>The judgment appealed from is reversed and we freely acquit the accused, with the costs of both instances <em>de oficio<\/em>.<\/p><p><em>Torres,\u00a0 Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/em>, and\u00a0 <em>Trent, JJ,<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

S. Crossfield, judge.<\/p>\n<p>On January  11,  1909, the Chinaman, Tan Chiong Sian or Tan Chinto, filed a written complaint, which was amended on  the 28th of the same month  and  again amended on October 27 of the same year, against the said firm, wherein he alleged, among other things, as a cause of action;  That, on or about November 25,1908, the plaintiff delivered to the defendant 205 bundles or cases of general merchandise belonging to  him, which  Inchausti  &amp; Co., upon  receiving, bound themselves to deliver in the pueblo of Catarman, Province  of Samar, to the Chinaman, Ong Bieng Sip,  and in consideration of the  obligations contracted by the defendant party, the  plaintiff obligated himself to pay to the latter the  sum of P250 Philippine currency, which payment should be made  upon the delivery of the said merchandise in the said  pueblo of Catarman;  but that the defendant company neither carried nor delivered the aforementioned merchandise to the said  Ong Bieng Sip, in Catarman,  but unjustly and negligently failed to do so, with the result that the said merchandise was almost totally lost; that,  had the defendant party complied well and faithfully with its obligation, according to the agreement made, the merchandise concerned would have had a value of ^20,000 in the said pueblo of Catarmaii on  the  date when it should have been  delivered there, wherefore the defendant party owed the plaintiff the said sum of P20,000, which it had not paid him, or any part thereof, notwithstanding the many demands of the plaintiff; therefore the  latter prayed  for  judgment against the defendant for the said sum, together with legal interest thereon from November  25, 1908, arid the costs of the suit.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel  for the defendant company, in his answer, set forth.that  he admitted the allegations of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the complaint, amended for the second time, and denied those of paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6,  and 7 of the same.  As his first special defense, he alleged that on or about November 28, 1908, his client, the said firm, received in Manila from Ong Bieng Sip 205 bundles, bales, or cases of merchandise to be placed  on board the steamer <em>Sorsogon,<\/em> belonging to the defendant, for shipment to  the port of Gubat, Province of Sorsogon, to be in the said port transshipped into another of the defendant's vessels for transportation to the port of Catarman,  Samar, and delivered to the aforesaid Chinaman, Ong Bieng Sip; that the defendant company, upon  receiving the said merchandise from the latter, Ong Bieng Sip, and on its entering into a contract of maritime transportation with him did not know and was not notified that the plaintiff, Tan Chiong Sian, had any interest whatever in the said merchandise and had made with the plaintiff no contract relative to the transportation of such goods, for, on  receiving the latter from the said Ong Bieng Sip, for transportation, there were made out and delivered to  him three bills of lading, Nos. 38, 39, and  76, which contained a list of the goods received and, printed on the back thereof  were the terms of the maritime transportation contract entered into by and between the plaintiff  and the defendant company, copies  of which bills of  lading and contract, marked as Exhibits A, B, and C, are of  record, attached to and made an integral part of the said  answer; 4hat  Ong Bieng Sip accepted the said bills of lading and the contract  extended on the backs thereof; that the merchandise mentioned was put on board the steamer <em>Sorsogon<\/em> and carried to the port of Gubat, Province of Sorsogon, where this vessel arrived on November 28, 1908, on which date the lorcka Pilar, into which the said  merchandise was. to be  transshipped for carriage to Catarman, was not at Gubat,  and therefore the goods had to be  unloaded and stored in the defendant company's warehouses at Gubat; that, on the 4th of December of the same year, the <em>lorcha  Pilar<\/em> arrived at  Gubat and, after the termination of certain necessary work, the goods received from the Chinaman, Ong Bieng Sip,  were taken aboard the same, together with other merchandise belonging to the defendant party, for the purpose of transportation to the port of Catarman; that, before tfie  said lorcha could leave for its destination, a strong wind arose which in the course of the day .increased in force until, early in the morning of the following day, the <em>lorcha <\/em>was dragged and driven, by the force of the storm, upon the shore, despite the means employed by the crew to avoid the accident, dnd notwithstanding the five anchors that held the craft, which was thus wrecked, and  completely destroyed and the merchandise with which it was laden, including the  205 bundles or packages taken aboard for the said Chinaman, was scattered on the shore; that, on that occasion, the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em> was in good condition, provided with all  the  proper and necessary equipment and accessories and carried a crew of sufficient number in command of a skillful patron or master, wherefore the wreck of the said craft was solely due to the irresistible force of the elements and of the storm which drove it upon the shore; that the defendant company, with the greatest possible diligence, gathered  up the said shipwrecked goods  that had been  shipped by the Chinaman, Ong Bieng Sip, but, owing'to the damage they had suffered, it was impossible to preserve them,,so, after having offered to deliver them to him, the defendant proceeded, in the presence  of a notary, to sell them at public  auction and realized from the sale thereof P1,693.67, the reasonable value of the same in the condition in which they were after they had been gathered up and salved from the wreck of the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em>; that the expenses occasioned by such salvage and sale of the said goods amounted to Pl51.35, which were paid by the defendant party; that the latter offered to the Chinese shipper, the plaintiff, the amount realized from the sale of the said merchandise, less P151.35, the amount of the expenses,  and  the sum of P250, the amount  of the freight stipulated, and is still willing to pay such products of the said sale to the aforementioned Ong Bieng Sip or to any other  person who should establish his subrogation to the rights of  the Chinaman, Ong Bieng Sip, with respect to the  said amount; that, as his client's second  special defense, the defendant company alleged that one  of the conditions of the  shipping contract executed between  it and the Chinaman, Ong Bieng Sip, relative to the transportation of the said merchandise, was that the said firm  should not be held liable for  more than P25 for any bundle or package, unless the value of its contents should be stated  in the bill of lading, and that the-shipper, the  Chinaman, Ong  Bieng Sip, did not state in the bill of lading the value of any of the bundles or packages in which the goods shipped by him were packed.   Counsel  for the defendant company,  therefore, prayed the  court to absolve his client from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>After the hearing  of the  case and the introduction of testimony by the parties, judgment was rendered, on March 18, 1910, in favor of the plaintiff, Tan Chiong Sian or Tan Chinto, against the defendant Inchausti &amp; Co., for the sum of P14,642.68, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum  from January 11,  1909, and for the costs  of the trial.   The defendant  party appealed from this judgment.<\/p>\n<p>This  suit was  brought for the purpose of collecting a certain sum which it is alleged the defendant firm owes the plaintiff for losses and damages  suffered by the latter as a result of the former's noncompliance with the terms of an agreement or contract to transport certain merchandise by sea from this city to the  pueblo of Catarman,  Island of Samar, for the sum of P250.<\/p>\n<p>The principal question to  be  determined is whether the defendant  is liable  for  the  loss of  the  merchandise  and for failure to deliver the same at the place of destination, or whether he is relieved from responsibility on the ground of <em>force majeure.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Article 1601 of the Civil Code prescribes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Carriers of goods by land or by water shall be subject with regard to the keeping and preservation of the things entrusted to them, to the same obligations as determined for innkeepers by articles 1783 and 1784.<\/p>\n<p>\"The provisions of this article shall be understood without prejudice to what is prescribed  by the Code of Commerce with regard to transportation by sea and land.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Article 1602 reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Carriers are also liable for the loss of and damage to the things  which they receive, unless they prove that the loss  or damage arose from  a. fortuitous event  or <em> force majeure.<\/em>\"'<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The articles aforecited are  as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ART. 1783. The depositum of goods made by travelers in inns or hostelries shall also be considered a necessary one. The  keepers  of inns and hostelries' are liable for them as such bailees, provided that notice  thereof may have been given to them or to  their employees, and that the travelers on their part take  the precautions which said innkeepers or their substitutes may have advised them concerning the care and vigilance of said goods.<\/p>\n<p>\"ART.  1784. The  liability  referred to in the  preceding article shall include  damages to the goods of the travelers caused by servants or employees of the keepers of inns or hostelries as well  as by strangers, but not those arising from robbery or which may be caused by any other case of <em>force majeure<\/em>.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Article 361 of the Code of Commerce provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Merchandise shall be transported at the  risk  and venture of the  shipper, unless  the contrary was  expressly stipulated.<\/p>\n<p>\"Therefore, all damages and impairment suffered by the goods in transportation, by reason of accident, force ma- jeure, or by virtue of tne nature or defect of the articles, shall be for the account and risk of the shipper.<\/p>\n<p>\"The proof of these accidents is incumbent on the carrier.<\/p>\n<p>\"ART. 362. The carrier, however,  shall be liable for the losses and damages arising from the causes mentioned in the foregoing article if it is proved that they occurred on account of his negligence or  because he did  not take the precautions usually adopted by careful persons, unless the shipper committed fraud  in the bill of lading, stating that the goods were of a class or quality different from what they really were.<\/p>\n<p>\"If, notwithstanding the precaution referred'to in this article, the goods transported run the risk  of being lost on account of the nature or by reason  of an  unavoidable accident, without there being time for the owners of the same to dispose thereof, the carrier shall proceed to their  sale, placing them for this purpose  at the disposal of the judicial authority or of the officials determined by special provisions.<\/p>\n<p>\"ART. 363. With the exception of the cases prescribed in the second paragraph of article 361, the  carrier shall  be obliged to deliver the goods transported in the same  condition in which, according to  the bill of lading, they were at the time of their receipt, without any  detriment  or impairment, and  should  he not do so, he  shall  be obliged to pay the value of the goods not delivered  at the point where they  should have been  and  at the time the delivery should have taken place.<\/p>\n<p>\"If part of the goods transported \"should  be delivered the consignee may refuse to receive them, when he proves  that he can not make use thereof without the others.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>On November  25, 1908, Inchausti &amp; Co.  received  in Manila from the Chinaman,  Ong Bieng Sip,  205  bundles, bales or cases of goods to be conveyed by the steamer  <em>Sorsogon<\/em> to the port of Gubat,  Province of Sorsogon,  where they were to be transshipped to another vessel belonging to the defendant company  and by the latter transported  to            the  pueblo of Catarman, Island of Samar,  there to be delivered to the Chinese shipper with whom the defendant party made the shipping  contract.  To this end three bills of lading were executed, Nos. 38, 39, and 76, copies of which, marked as Exhibits A, B, and C, are found on pages 13, 14, and 15 of the record.<\/p>\n<p>The steamer <em>Sorsogon<\/em>, which carried the goods,  arrived at the port of Gubat on the 28th of that month and as the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em>, to which the merchandise was to be transshipped  for its transportation to Catarman, was not yet there, the cargo was  unloaded and  stored in the defendant company's warehouses at that port.<\/p>\n<p>Several days later, the <em>lorcha<\/em> just mentioned arrived at Gubat and, after the cargo it carried had been unloaded, the merchandise belonging to the Chinaman, Ong Bieng Sip, together with  other goods owned by  the defendant Inchausti &amp; Co., was taken aboard to be transported to Catarman ; but on December 5,  1908, before the Pilar could leave for its destination, towed by the launch Texas,  there arose a storm,  which, coming from the Pacific, passed over Gubat and, as a result of the strong wind and heavy sea, the lorcha was driven upon the shore and wrecked, and its cargo, including the Chinese shipper's 205 packages of goods, scattered on the beach.   Laborers or workmen of the defendant company, by its order, then proceeded to gather  up  the plaintiff's merchandise and, as it was impossible to preserve it after it was salved from the wreck of the lorcha, it was sold at public auction before  a notary for the sum  of P1,693.67.<\/p>\n<p>The contract entered into between the  Chinese shipper, Ong Bieng Sip, and  the firm of Inchausti &amp; Co.,  provided that transportation should be  furnished  from Manila  to Catarman, although  the  merchandise  taken  aboard  the steamer <em>Sorsogon<\/em> was to  be transshipped at Gubat to  an- other vessel which was to convey it from that port to Catarman; it was not stipulated in the said contract that the Sorsogon should convey the goods to their final destination, nor that the vessel into which they were  to be transshipped, should be a steamer.  The shipper, Ong Bieng Sip, therefore assented to these arrangements and made no protest when his 205  packages of merchandise were unloaded from the ship and,  on account of the absence of the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em>, stored  in the warehouses at  Gubat nor did he offer any objection to the lading of his merchandise on to this <em>lorcha<\/em> as soon as it  arrived and was prepared to receive cargo; moreover, he knew that to reach the port of Catarman with promptness and dispatch, the lorcha had to be towed by some vessel like the launch Texas, which the defendant company had been steadily using for similar operations in those waters.<\/p>\n<p>Hence the shipper, Ong Bieng Sip, made no protest or objection to the methods  adopted by the agents of the defendant for the transportation  of his goods to  the port of their destination, and the record does not show that in Gubat the defendant possessed  any other means for the conveyance and transportation of merchandise, at least for Catarman,  than the lorcha Pilar, towed by the said launch and exposed  during its  passage to all sorts  of accidents and perils  from the nature  and seafaring qualities of a <em>lorcha<\/em>, from the circumstances then present and the winds prevailing  on  the  Pacific Ocean during the months  of November and December.<\/p>\n<p>It is to be noted that a lorcha is not easily managed or steered when traveling, for, out at sea, it can only be moved by wind and sails; and along the coast near the shore and in the estuaries where it customarily  travels, it can only move by poling.  For this reason, in order to arrive at the pueblo of Catarman  with promptness and dispatch,  the <em>lorcha<\/em> was usually towed by the launch Texas.<\/p>\n<p>The record does not show that, from the afternoon of the 4th of  December, 1908, until the morning of the following day, the 5th, the patron or master of the <em>lorcha<\/em> which was anchored in the cove of Gubat, received any notice from the captain of the steamer <em>Ton Yek<\/em>, also anchored near by, of the near approach of a storm.  The said captain, Juan Domingo Alberdi, makes no reference in his sworn testimony of having given any such notice to the <em>patron of the lorcha<\/em>, nor did the latter,  Mariano Gadvilao, testify that he received such notice from the captain of the Ton Yek or from the person in charge of the Government observatory.  Gadvilao, the patron, testified that  only between 10 and 11 o'clock of Saturday  morning, the 5th of December, was he informed by Inchausti &amp; Co.'s agent in Gubat that a <em>baguio<\/em> was approaching; that thereupon, on account of the condi- tion of the sea, he dropped the four anchors that the <em>lorcha<\/em> had on board and immediately went ashore to get another anchor and a new cable in order more securely to hold the boat  in view of the  predicted storm.  This testimony was corroborated by  the said representative, Melchor Munoz. So the <em>lorcha<\/em>, when  the storm broke upon it, was held fast by five anchors and was, as testified by the defendant with- out contradiction or evidence to the contrary, well found and provided with all proper and necessary equipment and had a sufficient crew for its management and preservation.<\/p>\n<p>The patron  of the <em>lorcha<\/em>  testified specifically that at Gubat or in its immediate vicinity there is no port whatever adequate for the shelter and refuge of vessels in cases of danger, and that, even though there were, on being advised between 10 and 11 o'clock of the morning of the 5th, of the approach  of a storm from the eastern Pacific,  it would have  been impossible to spread any sails or weigh anchor on the <em>lorcha<\/em> without being dragged or driven  against the reefs by the force of the wind.  As the craft was not provided with steam or  other motive power, it would not have been possible for  it to change its anchorage, nor move from the place where it lay, even several hours before the notice was received by its patron.  A lorcha can not be compared with a steamer which does not need the  help or assistance of any other vessel in its movements.<\/p>\n<p>Due importance must be given to the testimony of the weather observer, Antonio Hocha, that the notice received from the Manila Observatory on the afternoon of December 4,  with regard to a storm traveling from the,east  of the Pelew Islands toward  the northwest, was not made known to  the people of Gubat and that he merely left a memorandum notice  on the desk of the station, intending to give explanations thereof to any person who should request them of  him.   So the notice of the storm sent by the Manila Observatory was only known to the said observer, and he did not apprise  the public of the approach of the storm until he received another notice from Manila at 20 minutes past 8 o'clock on Saturday morning, December 5.   Then he made a public announcement and advised the authorities of the. storm that was coming.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>patron<\/em> of the  <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em> is charged with gross negligence for not having endeavored to  remove his craft to a safe place in the Sabang River, about half a mile from where it was anchored.<\/p>\n<p>In order to find out whether there was or was not such negligence on the part of the  <em>patron<\/em>, it becomes necessary to  determine, first, whether the <em>lorcha<\/em>,  on the morning of December 5, could be moved by its own  power and without being towed by any steamboat, since it had no steam engine of its own; second, whether the <em>lorcha<\/em>,  on account of its  draft and the shallowness of the mouth of the said river, , could have entered the latter before the  storm broke.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>patron<\/em>, Mariano Gadvilao, stated under oath that the weather during the night of December 4 was not threatening and he did not believe there would be  a storm; that he knew the Sabang River; and that the  <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em>,  when loaded,  could not enter as there was not sufficient water in  its channel; that, according to an official chart of the port of Gubat, the bar of the Sabang River  was covered by  only a foot and a half of water at ordinary low tide and the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em>, when  loaded,  drew 6 feet and a half; that aside from  the fact that the condition of the sea would not have  peinvtted the <em>lorcha <\/em>to take shelter in the said river, even  could it  have relied upon the assistance of a towboat, at half past 8 o'clock in the morning the tide was          still low; there was but little water in the river and still less over the bar.<\/p>\n<p>It was proven by the said  official chart of the port of Gubat, that the depth of water over the bar or entrance of the Sabang River is only one foot and a half at ordinary low tide; that the rise and fall of the tide is about 4 1\/2 feet, the highest tide being at 2 o'clock in the afternoon of every day; and at that hour, on the 5th of December, the hurricane had already made its appearance and the wind was blowing with all  its fury and raising great waves.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em>, loaded as it had been from the afternoon of December 4, even  though it could have  been  moved by means of poles, without being towed,  evidently could not have entered the Sabang River on the morning of the 5th, when the wind began to increase and  the sea to become rough, on  account of the low  tide, the  shallowness of the channel,  and the boat's draft<\/p>\n<p>The facts stated in the foregoing paragraph were proved by the said chart wliich was exhibited in evidence and not rejected  or assailed by the plaintiff.  They were also sup- ported by the sworn testimony of the patron of the lorcha, unrebutted by any oral evidence on the  part of the plaintiff such as might  disprove the certainty of the facts  related, and, according to section 275 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the natural phenomenon of the tides, mentioned in the official hydrographic map, Exhibit 7, which is prima facie evidence on the subject, of the hours of its occurrence and of the conditions and circumstances of the port of  Gubat, shall be judicially l^ecognized  without.-the., introduction  of  proof, unless facts to the contrary be proven, which was not done by the plaintiff, nor was it proven that  between the hours of 10 and IX o'clock of the  morning of December 5,  1908, there did not prevail a state of Ipw tide in the port of Gubat.<\/p>\n<p>The oral evidence adduced by the plaintiff with respect to the depth of the Sabang River, was unable to overcome that introduced by  the defendant especially the  said  chart. According  to section 320 of the Code of Civil Procedure, such a chart is <em>prima facie<\/em> evidence of particulars of general notoriety and interest, such as the existence of shoals of varying depths in the bar and mouth of the Sabang River and which obstruct the entrance  into the same; the  distance,  length, and number  of the said shoals, with other details apparently well  known to the <em>patron<\/em> of the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em>, to judge from his testimony.<\/p>\n<p>Vessels of considerable draft, larger than the said <em>lorcha<\/em>, might  have  entered the Sabang River some seven or nine years before, according to the testimony  of the Chinaman, Antonio B. Yap Cunco, though he did not state whether they did so at high tide; but, since 1901, or previous years, until 1908, changes may have taken place in the bed  of the river, its  mouth and its  bar.  More shoals may have formed or those  in existence  may have increased  in  extent by  the constant action of  the  sea.  This is the reason why  the <em>patron<\/em>, Gadvilao, who was acquainted with the conditions of the  port and cove of Gubat, positively declared that the <em>lorcha  Pilar<\/em> could not,  on account of her draft, enter the Sabang River, on  account of low  water.<\/p>\n<p>The  <em>patron<\/em> of the <em>lorcha<\/em>, after stating (p.  58) that at Gubat or in its vicinity there is no  port that affords shelter, affirmed that it was impossible to  hoist the  sails or weigh the anchors  on the morning of the 5th of December, owing to the force  of the wind and because the boat would immediately have been dragged or driven upon the  shoals; that furthermore the <em>lorcha<\/em> was anchored in a channel some 800 <em>brazas<\/em> wide, but, notwithstanding this width, the <em>Pilar<\/em> was, for want of  motive power,  unable to move without being exposed to be dashed against the coast by the strong wind and the heavy sea then prevailing.  The testimony of this witness was neither impugned nor offset by any evidence whatever; he was a <em>patron<\/em> of long years of service  and of much practice  in seafaring,  especially  in  the port of Gubat and its  vicinity, who  had commanded  or been intrusted with the command of other crafts similar to the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em> and his testimony was absolutely uncontradicted.<\/p>\n<p>The  <em>patron<\/em> Gadvilao, being  cognizant  of the  duties imposed upon him by rules 14 and 15 of article 612, and others, of the Code of Commerce, remained with his sailors, during the  time  the hurricane  was raging, on board the lorcha from the  morning of  December 5 until early the following morning, the 6th, without abandoning the boat, notwithstanding  the imminent peril to which he  was exposed, and kept to his post until after the  wreck and the <em>lorcha<\/em> had been dashed against the rocks.  Then he  solicited help from the captain of the  steamer  <em>Ton Yek<\/em>, and, thanks to the relief afforded  by a  small boat sent by the latter officer, Gadvilao with his crew succeeded in reaching land and immediately reported the occurrence to the representative of Inchausti &amp;  Co. and to the public official from whom he obtained the document of  protest, Exhibit 1.  By such procedure, he showed that, as a patron skilled in the exercise  of his vocation, he performed the duties  imposed by  law  in  cases  of shipwreck  brought about by <em>force majeure<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Treating of shipwrecks, article 840 of the Code of Commerce prescribes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The losses and damages suffered by a vessel and her cargo by reason  of shipwreck or stranding shall  be indir vidually  for the  account of the  owners,  the part of the wreck which may be saved belonging to them in the same proportion.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>And article 841 of the same code reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If  the wreck  or  stranding  should arise  through the malice, negligence, or lack^of skill of the captain, or because the vessel put to  sea insufficiently  repaired and supplied, the owner or the  freighters may demand indemnity of the captain for  the damages caused to  the vessel or cargo by the accident, in accordance with the provisions contained in articles 610, 612, 614, and 621.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The general rule established in the first of the foregoing articles is that the loss of the vessel and of its cargo, as the  result of shipwreck,  shall fall  upon  the respective owners thereof, save for  the exceptions specified in the second of the said articles.<\/p>\n<p>These legal provisions are in harmony  with those of articles 361 and  362 of the Code of Commerce,  and are applicable whenever it is proved that the loss of, or damage to, the  goods was the result of a fortuitous event or of <em>force majeure<\/em>; but the  carrier shall be liable for  the loss or the damage arising from the causes aforementioned, if it shall have been proven  that they occurred through his own fault or negligence or by his failure to take the  same precautions usually adopted by diligent and careful  persons.<\/p>\n<p>In the contract  made and entered into by and  between the owner of the  goods and the defendant, no term was fixed within which the said merchandise should be delivered to the former at  Catarman, nor was it proved that there was any delay in  loading the goods and transporting them to their  destination.  From the 28th of November, when the steamer <em>Sorsogon<\/em> arrived at Gubat and landed  the said goods belonging to Ong Bieng Sip to  await the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em> which was to convey them to Catarman, as agreed upon, no  vessel  carrying merchandise made the  voyage from Gubat to the said pueblo of the Island of Samar, and  with Ong Bieng Sip's merchandise there were also to be shipped goods belonging to the defendant company, which goods were actually taken on board the said lorcha and suffered the same damage as those belonging to the Chinaman.  So: that there was no negligence, abandonment, or delay  in the shipment of Ong Bieng Sip's  merchandise, and all that was done by the carrier, Inchausti &amp; Co.,  was what  it regularly and usually did, in the transportation by sea from Manila to Catarman of all classes of  merchandise.  No  attempt has been made to prove .that any course other than the foregoing was pursued by that firm on this occasion; therefore the  defendant  party is  not liable for the  damage occasioned as  a result of the wreck or  stranding of the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em> because of the hurricane that overtook this craft while it was anchored in the port of Gubat, on December 5, 1908, ready to be conveyed to that of Catarman,<\/p>\n<p>It is a fact not disputed, and admitted by the plaintiff, that the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em> was stranded and wrecked on the coast of.Gubat during the night of the 5th or early in  the morning of the 6th of December, 1908, as the result of a violent storm that came from the Pacific Ocean, and, consequently, it is  a  proven fact that the loss or damage of  the goods shipped on  the said <em>lorcha<\/em> was due to the  <em>force majeure<\/em> which caused the wreck of the said craft.<\/p>\n<p>According to the  aforecited article 361 of the Code  of Commerce,  merchandise shall  be transported  at the  risk and venture of the shipper, unless the contrary be expressly stipulated.  No  such stipulation appears of  record, therefore,  all damages and impairment  suffered  by  the goods in transportation, by reason of accident, <em>force  majeure<\/em>,  or by virtue of the nature or defect of the articles, are for the account and risk of the shipper.<\/p>\n<p>A final clause of this same article adds that the  burden  of proof of these accidents is upon the  carrier; the trial record fully discloses that the loss and damage of the goods shipped by the Chinaman, Ong Bieng Sip, was  due to the  stranding and wreck of the <em>lorcha Pilar <\/em>in the heavy storm or hurricane aforementioned; this the plaintiff did not deny,  and admitted that it  took place between the afternoon of the 5th and early in the morning of the 6th of December, 1908, so it  is  evident  that the  defendant is exempt  from the obligation imposed by the law to prove the occurrence of the said storm, hurricane, or cyclone in the port of  Gubat, and, therefore, if the said goods were lost or damaged  and could not be delivered in Catarman, it was due to a fortuitous event and a superior, irresistible natural  force,  or <em>force majeure<\/em>, which completely disabled  the <em>lorcha<\/em> intended for their transportation to the said port of  the Island of Samar.<\/p>\n<p>The record bears no proof that the  said loss or damage caused by the stranding or wreck of the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em> as a result of the storm mentioned, occurred  through carelessness or negligence on the part of the defendant company, its agents or the patron of the said <em>lorcha<\/em>, or because they did not take  the precautions usually  adopted by careful and diligent persons, as required by article 362 of the Code of Commerce; the defendant company, as well as its agents and the patron of the lorcha, had a natural interest in preserving the craft and its own goods laden therein  n interest equal to that of the Chinese shipper in preserving his own which were  on board the said <em>lorcha<\/em>\u2014and,  in  fact, the defendant, his agents and the <em>patron<\/em> did  take the measures which they deemed necessary and proper in order to save the <em>lorcha <\/em>and its cargo from the impending danger; accordingly, the patron,  as soon as  he  was informed that a storm was approaching,  proceeded to clear the boat of all gear which might offer resistance to the wind, dropped the four anchors he had, and even  procured an extra anchor from  the  land,  together with a new cable,  and cast it into the water, thereby adding, in so far as  possible, to the stability and  security of  the craft, in anticipation of  what might occur,  as presaged by the violence of the wind and the heavy sea; and Inchausti &amp; Company's agent furnished the articles requested by the <em>patron<\/em> of the <em>lorcha<\/em> for the purpose of preventing the loss of the boat; thus did they all display all the diligence and care, such as might have been&gt; employed by anyone in similar circumstances, especially the patron who was responsible for the lorcha under his charge; nor is it possible to believe that the latter failed to adopt all the measures that were necessary to  save his own life and those of the crew and to free himself from the imminent peril of shipwreck.<\/p>\n<p>In view of the fact that the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em> had no means ot changing its anchorage, even supposing that there was a better one, and was unable to accept help from any steamer that might have towed it to another point, as wherever it might have anchored, it would continually have been exposed to the lashing of the waves and to the fury of the hurricane, for the port of Gubat is a cove or open roadstead with no shelter whatever from the winds that sweep over it from the Pacific Ocean, and in view of the circumstance that it was impossible for the said <em>lorcha<\/em>, loaded as  it then was, to have entered the Sabang River, even though there had been a steamer to tow it, not only because of an insufficient depth of water in its channel, but also on account of the very high bar at the entrance of the said river, it is incontrovertible that the stranding and wreck of the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em> was due to a fortuitous event or to <em>force mqjeure <\/em>and not to the fault and negligence of the defendant company and its agents  or of the patron, Mariano Gadvilao, inasmuch as the record discloses it to  have been duly  proved that the latter,  in the difficult situation in which unfortunately the boat under his charge was placed, took all the precautions that any diligent man should have taken whose duty it was to save the boat and its cargo, and, by the instinct of self-preservation, his own life and those of the crew of the lorcha; therefore,  considering the conduct of the <em>patron<\/em> of the lorcha and that  of the defendant's agent in Gubat, during the time of the occurrence of the disaster, the defendant company has not incurred any liability whatever for the loss of the goods, the value of which is demanded* by the plaintiff; it must, besides, be taken into account that the defendant itself also lost goods of its own and the <em>lorcha<\/em> too.<\/p>\n<p>From the moment that it is held that the loss of the said <em>lorcha<\/em> was due to <em>force majeure<\/em>, a fortuitous event,  with no conclusive proof of negligence or of the failure to take the precautions such as diligent and careful persons usually adopt to avoid the loss of the boat and its cargo, it is neither just nor proper to attribute the loss or damage of the goods in question to any fault, carelessness,  or negligence on the part of the defendant company and its agents and, especially, the <em>patron<\/em> of the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em>.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nMoreover, it is to be noted that, subsequent to the wreck, the defendant company's agent took all the requisite measures for the salvage  of such of the goods as could be recovered after the accident, which he did with the knowledge of the shipper, Ong Bieng Sip, and, in effecting their sale,  he endeavored to secure all possible advantage to the Chinese shipper; in all these proceedings, as shown by the record, he acted in obedience to the law. <\/p>\n<p>From all the foregoing  it is concluded that the defendant is not liable for the loss and damage of the goods shipped on the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em> by the Chinaman, Ong Bieng Sip, inasmuch as such loss and damage were the result of a fortuitous event  or  <em>force majeure<\/em>,  and there was  no negligence or lack of care and diligence  on the part of the defendant company or its agents.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, we hold it proper to reverse the judgment appealed from, and to absolve, as we hereby do, the defendant, Inchausti  &amp; Co., without special finding as to costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The defendant, a shipowner, agreed with  the plaintiff to transport P14,000 worth  of  property from Manila to Catarman, Province of Samar. The defendant never fulfilled its contract.  Instead of delivering the property  at Catarman, Province of Samar, it left it on board of a <em>lorch<\/em>a in the waters of Gubat, a port in the  southern part of the Island of Luzon, where, during a storm, the <em>lorcha <\/em>foundered and the property was lost.<\/p>\n<p>This court holds that the Chinaman must lose his property. This is the manner in which the defendant lost the goods of the  plaintiff:<\/p>\n<p>The Sorsogon, on which the goods were loaded at Manila, arrived at Gubat about the 28th of November, 1908.  A few days later the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em> arrived at Gubat, towed by the tug Texas.  The <em>lorcha<\/em> was without means of locomotion of its own, except  its sails, which, from the record, appear never to have been used and were substantially useless,  and could move about and protect itself from the weather only by being towed  or \"poled.\"  The only boat on the coast owned by the defendant which could tow the lorcha was the tug <em>Texas<\/em>.   Sometime before the 5th of December, at least one day before the storm broke, the goods belonging to the plaintiff were loaded on this <em>lorcha<\/em>.  The tug <em>Texas<\/em>, under the orders  of the defends nt, left the .locality where  the lorcha was loaded and did  not return  until after it was wrecked.<\/p>\n<p>Let us see what were the conditions at the time the defendant voluntarily and unnecessarily placed the property of the plaintiff on the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em>;<\/p>\n<p>(1) It must be remembered that Gubat is located on the Pacific coast.  The waters  of Gubat are  not protected waters; they are not inclosed; they are not in the form of a bay; they are directly open to the winds from the Pacific Ocean, without protection or shelter of any kind, except possibly  the mouth of the river, a matter here in dispute and which will be referred to later.  They are likewise open to the full sweep of the waves of the Pacific coming from  its widest reaches.<\/p>\n<p>(2) At the time the plaintiff's goods were loaded upon the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em> it was the height of the typhoon season in that locality.  The prevailing winds were from the Pacific, Destructive <em>baguios<\/em> might  reasonably be expected at any time.  It was only with the  exercise of diligence and prudence that shipping could be protected therefrom.<\/p>\n<p>(3) As I have  before indicated,  the <em>lorcha Pilar<\/em> had substantially no means of locomotion of its own and depended for its. protection in stormy weather entirely upon the steam tug <em>Texas<\/em> or being \"poled\" into the mouth  of the river  by its crew.  At the  time of the storm which destroyed  the <em>lorcha<\/em>, and for some time prior thereto and for some days thereafter, the Texas was at the port of Barcelona, on the coast several miles south of Gubat, having been  sent  by order of the defendant, its owner.<\/p>\n<p>Summarizing,  theft,  we have the defendant voluntarily placing the property of the plaintiff upon the kind of craft above described,  dispatching to a distant port substantially - the only means of locomotion and protection  which that craft had,  except, as we have said, by being poled, placing that <em>lorcha <\/em>in waters directly exposed to the winds  and waves of the Pacific and at the mercy of every <em>baguio <\/em>that blew;  and this during  a  season  of the  year  when  winds were generally high and destructive <em>baguios<\/em> might be expected at any time, and with full knowledge that if a typhoon came while the agents  of the defendant were  unprepared the property of the plaintiff would in all probability be lost.<\/p>\n<p>Having these facts in mind, let us see what the agents of the defendant did to protect the property of the plaintiff which they had voluntarily placed in a situation of such peril.<\/p>\n<p>(4)  At the time of the destruction of the <em>lorcha <\/em>there was a Government weather observatory at Gubat which received advices many hours in advance of the approach of a typhoon toward that locality.  It had been there  for some years.   The purpose  of that  observatory was to furnish information to the public concerning the formation and approach of typhoons from the Pacific and of warning the people with exposed shipping to  take such precautions as were necessary for its protection.  This was known to the defendant's agents at Gubat.   They knew that the observatory had a public office,  open to anybody who cared to visit it, in which would be found all of the  latest  information relating to storms  and <em>baguios<\/em> coming from  the Pacific Ocean,  They knew that the  officials of said observatory were there for the express purpose of giving such information.  The defendant's agents had at Gubat a barometer and all the other instruments usually kept by seamen  and navigators for forecasting the weather.<\/p>\n<p>(5)  As we  have said, the storm occurred on the 5th of December.  It wrought  its greatest havoc late in the afternoon and the  early part of the night.  At about  2 o'clock on the day before the storm, that is, on the 4th of December, the observatory at Gubat received notice from  the Manila observatory that a <em>baguio<\/em> was forming in the Pacific Qcean. At about the same time at Barcelona, <em>only 10 miles south of Gubat<\/em>, the barometer on board the <em>Texas<\/em> dropped so rapidly ds to indicate suck dangerous weather probabilities that the captain of the <em>Texas<\/em> deemed it unsafe to venture out of the harbor.  On the same afternoon the barometer on board the only steam vessel near Gubat, the Ton Yek, also went down. Although it does not expressly appear in  the evidence, yet it is an inference entirely fair from the record, and against which nothing whatever can be urged, that the barometer in the possession of the agents of the defendant also dropped with the same rapidity.  In all human  probability  this could not be otherwise in  view of  the rapid and decisive fall of  the barometer on board  the Texas, only 10 miles away, and the fact that the typhoon broke over both places equally.  At the same time, and more  pronounced a little later, every symptom which men who have to deal with the sea could and would readily observe, and which the captain of the  <em>Ton Yek<\/em> did observe as a matter of fact, indicated the approach  of a  heavy storm.  These evidences  were heeded  by the captain of the  Ton Yek, who, early on the morning of the 6th, without waiting for the appearance of a storm signal at the observatory, sent a  messenger to the observatory for the purpose of ascertaining with more accuracy what was going to happen.  In spite of all of these things, most of which occurred on the afternoon or evening of the day preceding the storm, the agents of the defendant did absolutely nothing to inform  themselves as to  the  prospective weather conditions or as to whether or not a <em>baguio<\/em> was approaching, and did absolutely nothing to preserve or protect the property which they had placed in so exposed and dangerous a place.<\/p>\n<p>(6)  The morning of the 5th arrived.   As we have already stated, all of the signs which men  who have to do with the sea so readily read  indicated unquestionably and decisively the approach of the storm which the advices received  by  the observatory at 2  o'clock on the afternoon before told the inhabitants of that locality was probably coming. Still the  agents  of  the defendant did nothing. The captain of the <em>Ton Yek<\/em>, although his vessel was a steam vessel and was able to take casre of itself by reason of its machinery, judging these signs  and portents, found it advisable to consult with the observatory early on the morning of the 5th.  The approach of a storm was apparent to him and he took precautions accordingly.   Yet the agents of the defendant did nothing.  Although the <em>lorcha<\/em> on which they had put the property of the plaintiff was, <em>according to their own admissions,<\/em> utterly unprotected, and although P14,000 worth of goods intrusted to their care was in great  danger of being lost,  still they  did absolutely  nothing, either  by anticipation or otherwise, to protect that property  therefrom.<\/p>\n<p>(7)  On the morning of the 5th at about 8.20 or 8.30 o'clock the observatory ran up the first danger signal.  Still the agents of  the  defendant noted  nothing, did nothing. They paid absolutely no attention to it, as they had paid no attention whatever to  the other indications.  They left the <em>lorcha <\/em>to its fate without lifting a finger to  save it.  At 9 o'clock the  wind had risen and the waves had commenced to roll.   Still nothing  was done.  At 9.30 the winds were still stronger and the waves higher.  Still nothing was done. At 10.30 the increase  in  the strength of the wind and of the height of the waves continued.  And yet the agents of the defendant did nothing. It was well toward 11 o'clock before they began to move.  At  that time it was too late. The wind and waves were so high  that,  with the means at hand, the lorcha could  not be moved from the exposed posi- tion in which it was, even if it be conceded that there was any safer place within those waters.   The <em>lorcha<\/em> was pre- vented from dashing itself immediately upon the rocks only by virtue of its anchor.   At between 10.30 and 11 o'clock the captain of the <em>lorcha<\/em> came ashore to secure additional anchors.  At that time, however, as we  have observed, it was too late to unload  the goods and too late  to remove the torcha to a  safe place  within the mouth of the river, even if that were possible.  The agents of the defendant, having done absolutely nothing up to this time,  now found,  after they had awakened  from their lethargy, that it  was too late to do more than stand by and see the property, which had been instrusted to their care and for the carrying of which they had been paid, dashed to pieces on the rock and swallowed up by the sea.<\/p>\n<p>(8) For nearly eighteen hours prior to the disaster the information that the disaster was coming lay under the very noses of the agents of the defendant.  For nearly eighteen hours the barometer had been dropping steadily, so much so that their own vessel dared not leave a port only  10 miles distant <em>on the afternoon before<\/em>.  For eighteen hours every warning which nature could give,  indicating the disaster which subsequently came, had been repeatedly thrust upon them.  Yet they did nothing.   Having placed the goods of the plaintiff in an exposed and dangerous position, in waters open  to the winds and waves of the Pacific  Ocean,  at the height of the typhoon season, in a vessel which had no motive power of its own, and having  sent  away that which they themselves substantially admit  was its only protection, the agents of the  defendant exercised no care  or precaution whatever to the end that they might protect the goods which they themselves had so recklessly exposed.<\/p>\n<p>Yet this court, under such circumstances, holds  that the defendant may go in peace arid that  the plaintiff is the one who must bear the burden of such negligence. With that decision I can not agree.<\/p>\n<p>An act of God can not be urged for the protection of a person who has been guilty of gross negligence in not trying to avert its results.  One who has accepted  responsibility for pay can not weakly fold his hands  and say that he was prevented from meeting that responsibility  by an  act of God, when the exercise of ordinary care  and prudence would have averted the results flowing from that act. One who has placed the property of another, instructed  to his care,in an unseaworthy craft, upon dangerous waters, cannot absolve himself by crying, \"an act of God,\" when every effect which a  typhoon  produced upon that property could have been avoided by the exercise of common care and prudence. When the negligence of the carrier concurs with an act of God in producing a loss, the carrier is not exempted from liability by showing that the immediate cause of the damage was the act of God; or, as it has been expressed, \"when the loss is caused by the act  of God, if the negligence  of the carrier mingles with it as an  active and cooperative cause, he is still  liable.\"  The loss and damage to perishable articles  in consequence of the  weather  will not excuse the carrier if  it could have been prevented  by due care and diligence.  The carrier must not only show  that it did all that was usual, but <em>all that was necessary to be done under the circumstances.<\/em>  (Wing <em>vs.<\/em> New York, etc.,  Ry.  Co., Hilt.  (N. Y.), 235; Philleo <em>vs.<\/em> Sanford, 17 Tex., 228.) be exempt from liability for loss because of an act of God, the common  carrier must  be  free from any previous negligence or  misconduct by which that loss  or damage may have  been occasioned.   For,  although the  immediate or proximate  cause of a loss  in any given instance may have been what is termed an act of God, yet if the carrier unnecessarily exposed the  property to such accident by any culpable act or omission of his own, he is not excused.   (McGraw <em>vs.<\/em> Baltimore and Ohio Ry. Co., 41 Am. Rep., 696.) In the case of Wolf vs. American Express Co., 43 Mo., 421, Wagner, J., said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The act of God which excuses the carrier must not only be the proximate cause of the loss, but the better opinion is that it must be the sole cause.   And where the loss is caused by the 'act of God,' if the negligence of the carrier mingles with it as an active and cooperative cause, he is still responsible.   (Amies vs. Stevens, 1 Stra., 128.)\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Where perishable property,  such as potatoes, is  received by a common carrier at a season when a very low temperature may reasonably be apprehended, great diligence should be used in forwarding  such property with  dispatch and haste;  and where, by a delay of two or three days, the property is damaged  by freezing, the carrier may be held liable for the damage.  (Hewett <em>vs.<\/em> The Chicago, B. &amp; Q. Ry. Co.,  63  Ia.,  611.)  A carrier is  bound to  provide a vessel in all respects adequate to the purpose, with a cap- tain and crew  of requisite skill or ability; and, failing in these particulars, though the loss be occasioned by an act of God, the carrier may not set up a providential calamity to protect himself against what may have arisen from his own folly.   (Hart <em>vs.<\/em> Allen and Grant, 2 Watts (Pa.), 114.)<\/p>\n<p>This doctrine is fully supported by the Spanish authorities on the subject.<\/p>\n<p>Manresa in his, commentaries to section 1105 of the Civil Code of Spain, volume 8,  page 91, says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Elucidation of article  1105 and the idea of accident is interesting  under the  following aspects: Relation between it and the blame; enumeration of the requisites that must be present; proof of the event  and characterization thereof; and the consequences it produces.  Let us examine them.<\/p>\n<p>\"Even when  the distinction is simple and reasonable between blame for some exempting circumstance (because it may not be serious enough to involve such blame, under the law or  the obligation) and accident,  since the former admits an imputation which the latter excludes, even when the 'former may not be the basis for legal responsibility, and therefore it  can not be said that where no responsible blame exists  there the accident  commences, yet the latter is undeniably characterized by unexpectedness and inevitability, circumstances susceptible  of relative interpretation, and so whatever relates  to the blame must be taken into account, because, as  we  shall see, it is in a certain sense, especially in practical application, connected with the matter under consideration.<\/p>\n<p>\"Aside from this statement of ideas, there may be another of consequences, for in the complexity of facts, in the same obligation, there  may be present blame enough to involve such and  also  accident.  When both causes are present, with separation of time and effects, for partial breach due to one of them may be possible and then  the other may operate to aggravate or complete these consequences, the distinction is easy and to each cause may be assigned its own effect for the  corresponding  result,  as neither exemption, on account of accident, can be extended to what may be imputed nor to what in any way depends upon  it by basing responsibility arising from blame on  the fact that the damage is the result thereof.<\/p>\n<p>\"The  problem becomes  more difficult when both causes concur to produce the same  effect or when,  even  though the effect may be  due to accident, the obligor has  not exercised necessary diligence,  however blameless he was for the results arising from the breach.  In the first of the last two suppositions, the solution is plain, because when the obligor incurs  the blame of actually producing the result, even when it is not the only cause, or even the principal one, there is still sufficient  connection between it and the consequences to cause them to be imputed  to him and,  as a voluntary element exists in the causes, there is lacking the circumstance indispensable to ^exemption  on  account of accident.   The second  supposition presents a very difficult problem of proof, which rests upon  the obligor,  and calls for a careful analysis of the origin of the breach.   The difficulty in this  case  consists in that  the blame, in addition to  its subjective aspect for  imputing  the consequences  to  the obligor,  has  an objective aspect, to wit,  that  these consequences may arise, that the damage which must be repaired is caused, in such manner that due diligence may be lacking and yet not extend to the point of  involving  responsibility, because  it produces  no results.   Now then, if  an accident occurs under these conditions,  absolutely independent of the negligence that may have existed, it may have  occurred with or  without negligence and  therefore any derivation of consequences was lacking,  then  it can not be said that responsibility arises therefrom; but to reach this conclusion there first rests with the obligor proof so difficult that,  in addition  to overcoming the presumption of existence  of blame, it involves the very fine distinction of the origin  of the breach  and perfectly  reveals  the occurrence of the accident,  joined by  their  coexistence, and  demonstrating absolute  lack of consequences  and  influence  of blame.<\/p>\n<p>\"In connection with this question, a judgment of November 22, 1904, declares that there are some events which, independent of the  will of the obligor, hinder the fulfillment of the obligation, and yet do  not constitute cases of <em>force majeure <\/em>for the purposes of such fulfillment, because the possibility that they would occur could have been foreseen, articles 1101 and 1104 being applicable and not article 1105, since negligence or blame is  also present from not informing the obligee, either  at first or  later on, of the state of affairs and  the situation, so as to avoid the consequent damage.  This was the case of a bull fight that could not be held because the ring was not completed in time for reasons beyond the  control of  the contractor,  but the fact that the contract did not  state that the ring was  unconstructed and the possibility that it would not be at the time specified,  reveals, in the opinion of the court, the lack of foresight  or the negligence which makes article  1105 inapplicable.<\/p>\n<p>\"In an  essentially analogous way, judgments were pronounced on June 12, 1899 (<em>Tribunal  contenoioso  administrativo<\/em>), and on October 27, 1905  (<em>Sola tercera<\/em>), against the company leasing the tobacco monopoly, for lasses caused by theft and fire.  It was further  decided in these cases that the company and not the State must  bear the losses, for while accidental fire in a tobacco  factory and theft of stamped goods stored in a branch house may constitute accidents, yet they do not deserve this characterization when they occur through omission, neglect or lack of care which imply breach of the  contract.<\/p>\n<p>\"According to the text of article 1105,  which agrees with the rational idea of accident, it is sufficient for  the event to constitute such that it have any of the two characteristics enumerated; if it is foreseen, it is of little import that it be unavoidable; and if it is unavoidable it does not matter that it may have been foreseen.  The first supposition requires some explanation:  an  event  may be wholly  unforeseen, but, after it has occurred, be very slow in producing effects, and in such case, although it could not have been foreseen, as there is time before it produces its effects, the latter must be considered.<\/p>\n<p>\"Besides this special supposition, in which, if carefully considered, the two characteristics do not concur, since the idea of unexpectedness, as is  seen, is relative, it will be sufficient that one or the other be present.   The possibility of foresight must be weighed rationally with consideration of all the circumstances, but this general rule has, strictly speaking: an exception when the event, although in a general  way very difficult, almost impossible to be foreseen, should for some reason be known to the obligor in due time.<\/p>\n<p>\"The condition of inevitability can not be understood in so absolute a sense that it should take away the character of accident from many  that are strictly such, because they are undoubtedly  causes, however powerful  they  may  be, whose injurious effects might have been avoided by exercising a number of precautions, so exaggerated and so out of proportion to the importance  of  the trouble anticipated, that they would be unreasonable and  not required in law. In such cases, if the means which can and must rationally be, employed are not effective,  it will  be held to have been unavoidable. t So we see  demonstrated how the  idea of diligence is related, somewhat  in the nature of limitation, to the accident.<\/p>\n<p>\"Such was the doctrine established  in our ancient law   regarding the obligor; the reasons whereof are theoretically set forth  further on; and as a written provision,  law  20, title 13, partida 5, which expressly laid down this principle in connection with pawn-broking contracts, and.which was, by analogy, made the basis for extending a similar provision to the remaining cases.<\/p>\n<p>\"That the Civil Code is inspired by the same idea is clearly expressed in article 1183 thereof, the commentary on which should be consulted.  Still  such solution  depends upon the nature of the proof and of the accident,  since its existence as an abnormal event hindering the fulfillment of the obligation must be proved  and not presumed, and the burden of this  proof  rests upon the obligor, and not upon the obligee, whose proof would have to be negative.   Moreover since an accident is the basis  for exemption from responsibility, it must be proved by him who will benefit thereby and who  objects to the requirement that he fulfill his obligations.  To these reasons are joined those above set forth in connection with the proof of contractual blame, since they are, according to the same article, 1183, above cited, closely related questions, so much .so that they  become two phases of one question - presumption against the existence of accident and of what tends to establish presumption of blame, in the absence of proof to overcome it.<\/p>\n<p>\"Proof of accident must include these points: the occurrence of the event,  the bearing it has upon breach of the obligation, and the concurrence of unexpectedness and inevitability.   In connection  with the first two points,  the proof resting1 upon the obligor must be specific and exact; but as for the last, although it may be admitted as a general proposition that, in  addition to proving the event, he must also demonstrate that it involves the condition required to make it an accident, there are some of such magnitude and, by their nature, of almost impossible prevision, that proof of  their occurrence demonstrates  their condition.  Undoubtedly,  and differently from proof of the accident,  the exceptional circumstance  that the event  (which should as a  general  proposition  be regarded  as  unforeseen)  was known  to  the obligor  for  some  special  reason,  must  be proven  by the obligee who asserts it,  since the obligation of proof resting upon the former is fulfilled in this  regard by demonstrating that the event ought rationally to be held to have been unforeseen.<\/p>\n<p>\"Since proof of the accident is related to  proof  of  the blame, it is evident that the obligor must also prove, so  far as he is concerned, that he is not to blame for breach of the obligation.    <\/p>\n<p>\"Exemption  from responsibility in accidents established by article 1105 has, according to  its text, two exceptions, whereby an event may be plainly proven, and be unforeseen and unavoidable and still  not produce such exemption, viz, when the exception is either stipulated in the obligation or is expressly mentioned by the law.  The basis for these exceptions rests, according  to the  cases, either  upon the freedom of contracts, which is opposed to prohibition of a compact, wherein, without immorality,  there is merely an emphasized stipulation, which  is meant to  guarantee in every case an interest and indirectly to secure  careful and special diligence in the fulfillment of the obligation; or upon the nature of the obligations when risk is an essential element therein; or finally upon cases whose circumstances, as happens with that provided for by the last  paragraph of article 1096, justify the special strictness of the law.<\/p>\n<p>\"In conclusion, we shall point out  that in order to relieve the obligor from his obligation, it must be remembered that the occurrence of the event does not suffice, but that the impossibility of fulfilling the obligation must be the direct consequence of the accident,  so that  when it can be fulfilled it will subsist, even if only in part, and therefore, in order to see whether or not the accident produces this result the nature of the obligation must be considered, and according to whether it be specific or general, etc., it will or will not be extinguished.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>To hold the carrier responsible in the case at bar, it is not necessary to go so far as the authorities just  cited.  The negligence  is so clear  that  it is not necessary to  strain doctrines or even press them to their limits.<\/p>\n<p>I do not here argue the assertion of the  plaintiff denied by the defendant, that, at any time before nine o'clock of the day of the destruction  of the lorcha, the  defendant's agents could have placed the lorcha in the mouth of the river out of harm's way.   I believe that  a fair preponderance of the evidence shows that this could have been done.  The defendant denies this, asserting that the water was too shallow.  Nevertheless, fourteen  days after  the storm, the foundered lorcha, water-logged and undoubtedly containing water, was \"poled\" by its crew from the place where it went on the rocks to a place of safety inside the mouth of the river.  It is  more  than  probable that this could have been done at any time before the storm became too high.  At least common  prudence would have  required the unloading of the lorcha, which could easily have been accomplished before the storm if the agents of the defendant had  awakened themselves to their duty.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

PIO CAJUIGAN ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This case comes before us on appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Tarlac, the Honorable Julio Llorente presiding, condemning the defendants, the first as principal and the other three as sureties, to pay the plaintiff the sum of P1,855, together with penalties, interest, and costs.<br\/><br\/>The municipality of Moncada and the defendant, Pio Cajuigan, entered into a contract of lease whereby the plaintiff leased to this defendant certain fish ponds situated within the jurisdiction of that municipality for the term embracing July 1, 1908, to June 30, 1909, for which this defendant agreed to pay P3,710, in quarterly installments. By virtue of this lease, the fish ponds were duly delivered into the possession of the defendant Cajuigan by the plaintiff, and he forthwith began placing therein nets, corrals, and other accessories necessary for the conduct of a fishery. The lessee failing to meet his payments as provided in the contract of lease, petitioned for and received an extension, first until October 1, 1908, and second until November 30 of the same year.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Cajuigan claims that on this last-mentioned date he tendered to the municipal treasurer the sum of P1,855, but was told to return on December 2 as he, the treasurer, was then very busy; that he returned on said date and again tendered this money, which was refused. The plaintiff denies that either of these tenders was ever made by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The lease was declared rescinded by the municipal council on November 30, 1908, and on or about the sixth day of the following month the plaintiff, through its officials, entered the property and ejected the defendant and his tenants. Subsequently thereto and on February 15, 1910, this complaint was filed by the plaintiff, wherein judgment was asked against the defendant Pio Cajuigan as principal, and Florentino Sugui, Juan Isla, and Antero Alegado as sureties, for the sum of P3,710, together with penalties, interest, and costs. The plaintiff further asked the court to declare that the property of the sureties described in the complaint be sold to satisfy the judgment thus asked in case it was not satisfied otherwise. The defendants, after specifically denying all the allegations in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the complaint, alleged as a special defense that the failure to pay the rents as stipulated in the lease was not due to the fault of the defendant, but to that of the plaintiff, inasmuch as the plaintiff, through its treasurer, agreed to accept on December 2 the amount then due, but that when the tender was made, said treasurer refused to comply with this agreement. The defendants asked by way of cross-complaint damages in the sum of P9,800 against the plaintiff for forcibly taking possession of the leased premises and for the value of certain nets, corrals, etc., left in the fish ponds and seized by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The lower court awarded P1,855 in favor of the plaintiff, this being the amount of rent for the fish ponds for the period from July 1, 1908, to December 31, 1908, together with the penalties, legal interest, and costs of the cause. Recovery on the cross-complaint was denied.<br\/><br\/>The defendants appealed and made the following assignment of errors:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. The lower court erred in holding that the noncompliance with the terms of the contract in question was due to the fault or failure of Pio Cajuigan.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The lower court erred in holding that defendant Pio Cajuigan did not pay the first trimonthly payment due.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The lower court erred in holding that Pio Cajuigan owed P1,855, or any amount to plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>\"4. The lower court erred in not giving judgment against plaintiff and in favor of defendants or of Pio Cajuigan on their cross-complaint.<br\/><br\/>\"5. The lower court erred in deciding against defendants or either of them and in favor of plaintiff.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The first, second, and third assignments of error raise questions of fact and can be decided together.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, after presenting Exhibits A, B, C, and D, which were admitted without opposition, called Aguedo Ibarra, who, after being duly sworn, testified that he was municipal treasurer of Moncada during the year 1908 and up to May, 1909; that the lessee, Pio Cajuigan, during that time paid nothing on the lease, notwithstanding the fact that he had been requested to do so at various times and that the municipality was very anxious to collect this amount. This witness further testified that the lessee never at any time attempted or offered to pay any amount; and that he did not see the said lessee, either on the 30th of November or the 2d of December.<br\/><br\/>The first witness presented by the defense was Balbino Fabian, a subtenant of the lessee. This witness testified that he, together with Antero Alegado, one of the lessee's bondsmen, accompanied the lessee to the office of the municipal treasurer on the 30th of November and was present when the lessee offered to pay the municipal treasurer all that he, the lessee, was due to pay up to that time; that the municipal treasurer declined to receive this money, giving as an excuse that he was very busy, and told them to return on the 2d of December; that they did return on the 2d of December, the lessee carrying the money with him, and that they were then told by the treasurer that the lessee could not pay the amount due for the reason that the municipality had rescinded the lease. This witness also testified that as subtenant he had bought four hundred bamboos at P20 per hundred and made a fish corral and placed the same in the fish ponds, paying for the making of this corral P30.<br\/><br\/>Antero Alegado, the second witness, corroborated the testimony of the first witness with reference to what occurred in the municipal treasury on the 30th of November and the 2d of December.<br\/><br\/>The lessee, Pio Cajuigan, testified that not being able to pay either the first or the second quarterly payments when due, asked twice for an extension of time, which requests were granted, the last extension including the 30th of November; that on that day, the 30th of November, he, in company with Balbino Fabian and Antero Alegado, went to the municipal treasury, taking with him a sufficient amount of money to pay for both quarters; that on arriving there and saying to the treasurer that he had come for this purpose, the treasurer told him that he, the treasurer, was very busy, and for him to return on the 2d day of December; that he returned on this date and was then informed by the treasurer that he could not make the payment as the municipality had already rescinded the lease; that he never paid anything at any time on this contract except P186, which he had deposited as a guaranty of good faith before he took possession of the leased premises; that on being notified that the municipality had rescinded the lease on the 30th of November and after he had been forcibly evicted by the said municipality on or about the 6th of December, he filed a protest with the provincial board; that the provincial board notified him that his relief should be sought through the courts; that he had spent P100 in making nets, etc., which he had placed in the fish ponds; that all of these nets and other materials which he and his subtenant had placed upon the leased premises were appropriated at the time the municipality evicted him by means of force; and that it is true, according to the conditions of the lease, that if he failed to make the payments as required therein, the contract would be rescinded and he would lose the amount deposited.<br\/><br\/>The lessee testified as to the profits which he might reasonably expect if he had continued in possession of the premises until the expiration of the time stipulated in the contract. He also called witnesses who corroborated his testimony on this point.<br\/><br\/>As to whether or not the lessee did on the 30th of November and the 2d of December try to pay the amount which he then owed, the trial court accepted as true the testimony of the municipal treasurer, and found as a fact that the lessee never did at any time offer to make any payment. This finding of fact, we think, is supported by the preponderance of the evidence. The testimony of the municipal treasurer is clear, direct, positive, and convincing. This witness, as well as the municipality, was anxious that the lessee comply with the contract and make the payments. This is shown by the fact that the municipality, at the request of the lessee, gave two extensions of time in which these payments might be made. It was to the interest of the municipality that the lessee comply with his part of the contract. On the other hand, we have the testimony of the lessee, his subtenant, and one of his bondsmen, all of whom testified that the lessee did offer the treasurer the money. If the lessee had gone there with this money on the 30th of November, the treasurer would have unquestionably accepted it, or, even if the treasurer had refused to accept it under the pretense that he was busy, the lessee could have notified the municipal president, whose office was in the same building, and demanded that the treasurer be required to accept the money. Again, when the lessee filed his protest with the provincial board against the action of the municipal council in rescinding the contract, he said nothing about his offering to pay this money on the 30th of November and on the 2d of December, If he had made such an offer, this fact would have formed the very basis of his protest filed with the provincial board. By preponderance of evidence is not necessarily meant the greater number of witnesses. (Union Pac. Ry. Co. vs. Estes, 16 Pac, 131, 134, 37 Kan., 715; Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. vs. Retford, 18 Kan., 245, 251; McCarthy vs. Birmingham, 89 N. W., 1003, 2 Neb. (Unof.), 724; San Antonio &amp; A. P. Ry. Co. vs. Manning, 50 S. W., 177, 179, 20 Tex. Civ. App., 504; Pelitier vs. Chicago, St. P. M. &amp; O. R. Co., 60 N. W., 250, 251, 88 Wis., 521; North Chicago St. Ry. Co. vs. Fitzgibbons, 54 N. E., 483, 180 111., 466; Turner vs. Overall, 72 S. W. 644, 649, 172 Mo., 271.)<br\/><br\/>\"It is well settled that by the term 'preponderance of evidence,' is not meant the mere numerical array of witnesses, but it means the weight, credit, and value of the aggregate evidence on either side.\" (Coles vs. Anderson, 2 Tenn. (Lea) Rep., 14; Hills vs. Goodyear, 72 Tenn. (4 Lea), 233, 243, 40 Am. Rep., 5.)<br\/><br\/>The preponderance of evidence may be determined, under certain conditions, by the number of witnesses testifying to a particular fact or state of facts. For instance, one or two witnesses may testify to a given state of facts, and six or seven witnesses of equal candor, fairness, intelligence, and truthfulness, and equally well corroborated by all the remaining evidence, who have no greater interest in the result of the suit, testify against such state of facts. Then the preponderance of evidence is determined by the number of witnesses. (Wilcox vs. Hines, 100 Tenn. 524, 66 Am. St. Rep., 761.)<br\/><br\/>\"In determining the value and credibility of evidence, the witnesses are to be weighed, not numbered.\" (Foulke vs. Thalmessinger, 28 N. Y. Supp., 684, 685.) A preponderance of evidence means that the testimony adduced by one side is more credible and conclusive than that of the other. (Clayton vs. Keeler, 42 N. Y., Supp., 1051, 1056; Button vs. Metcalf, 80 Wis., 193.)<br\/><br\/>The lessee, Pio Cajuigan, testified that he had not paid at any time any amount on this contract of lease except P186 which he deposited as before stated. This testimony settles the second assignment of error.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for defendants says in his printed brief that plaintiff admitted having received from the defendant P1,484. Counsel is in error on this point. He has made an unintentional mistake. It is true that according to the fifth paragraph of the complaint as printed in the bill of exceptions the plaintiff made this admission. The fifth and sixth paragraphs of said complaint are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"5. The lessee has broken this obligation (that of paying the rent), and notwithstanding various extensions of time, has paid only P1,484.<br\/><br\/>\"6. The said lessee has been requested on various occasions by the municipal treasurer to pay the remainder of the rental charges, which amounts to P2,226, but up to the date of this complaint he has not done so.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>These same paragraphs, in the original complaint, which is signed by the attorney for the plaintiff, read as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"5. The lessee has broken this obligation (that of paying the rent), and notwithstanding various extensions of time, has paid nothing on his obligation.<br\/><br\/>\"6. The said lessee has been requested on various occasions by the municipal treasurer to pay the price of the concession, which is P3,710, but up to the date of this complaint he has not done so.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the prayer of the complaint as it appears in the bill of exceptions, the plaintiff asks judgment against the lessee as principal and the other defendants as sureties for the sum of P2,226, together with legal interest on this amount from the first day of December, 1908, and for the costs of the cause, while in the original complaint the plaintiff asked judgment against the lessee as principal and the other defendants as sureties for the sum of P3,710, together with 20 per cent penalties, legal interest, and costs. There is no explanation in the record as to how these mistakes were made in the bill of exceptions, which was approved by the trial court. That they are mistakes can not be questioned. The case was tried upon the theory that the lessee had made no payments whatever.<br\/><br\/>In support of the fourth and fifth assignments of error, counsel for the defendants says:<br\/><blockquote>\"There is but one way to oust an intruder who is in peaceable possession of the property in question. That is the legal way, by means of the court. A municipal corporation has more right than a private individual to constitute itself a judge and executioner and take the law into its own hands to enforce what it believes to be a civil grievance.<br\/><br\/><center>*******<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"The wrongful act of plaintiff is established beyond the peradventure of a doubt.<br\/><br\/>\"It was doubly wrongful as far as the bondsmen were concerned. Even if the defendant Cajuigan were delinquent (which we in no way admit) the bondsmen would not be liable under the terms of their mortgage unless Cajuigan failed to pay by the end of June of 1909.<br\/><br\/><center>*******<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"That Cajuigan has been injured by plaintiff's wrongful acts can in no sense be termed a doubtful issue. It is a certainty.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Counsel then endeavors to show that the fish ponds for the remainder of the year would have netted the lessee a profit of at least P9,500; that the lessee has been damaged in this amount; and that he, the lessee, is entitled to judgment accordingly.<br\/><br\/>In the contract of lease there are three principal conditions: First, the lessee obligated himself to pay the rents quarterly in advance, that is, on or before the tenth day of each quarter; second, if the lessee should fail to make the payments within the time specified, it was agreed that the plaintiff would be entitled to collect the same penalties as are imposed upon delinquent taxpayers; and third, if the lessee failed to make his payments during any quarter, the contract would or could be rescinded, the defendants would be responsible to the plaintiff for all damages caused by the breach of the contract, and the lessee would forfeit his deposit.<br\/><br\/>The bondsmen guaranteed not only the payment of the P8,710, but also interest and penalties in case the lessee failed to comply with his part of the contract.<br\/><br\/>The parties knew and understood all the conditions in these contracts and were bound by them. The contracts, being legitimate ones, were the law between the contracting parties. The lessee having failed to comply with the plain provisions of his contract by not making the payments as required therein, the plaintiff had a right to have the contract rescinded, collect the penalties, and confiscate the deposit as agreed upon between the contracting parties in said contract. (Arts. 1101, 1555, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>If the plaintiff had gone into court and prayed for a rescission of the contract, it could have no doubt obtained not only this relief but also a judgment for the amount of the rents during the time the lessee occupied the premises, together with penalties, interest, costs, and for the forfeiture of the deposit. The plaintiff did not, however, apply to the courts for this redress, but attempted itself to rescind the contract, and did forcibly eject the lessee, who was in peaceable and quiet possession; but the lessee did not obtain nor seek a reentry of the premises. Consequently, the plaintiff must be held responsible in damages for its illegal acts in forcibly ejecting the lessee, but such damages must be limited to the simple trespass. (Smith vs. Wunderlich, 70 111, 426, wherein the following cases and authorities are cited: Case vs. Shepard, 2 Johns. Cases, 27; 1 Ld. Raym., 692; 6 Salk., 639; 2 Ld. Raym., 974; 1 Leon., 302, 319; 13 Coke, 600; Menvil's Case, 3 Blac. Com., 210; Co, Litt., 257; Holmes vs. Seely, 19 Wend., 507; Rowland vs. Rowland, 8 (Ham.) Ohio R., 40; Shields vs. Henderson, 1 Lit. (Ky.) R., 239.) The lease not expiring until months after the ouster, the lessee is not, upon the principle of the authorities above cited, entitled to recover mesne profits from the ouster to the end of his term, but the damages must be confined to the ouster itself or the simple trespass. He is, however, entitled to recover for all the necessary and natural consequences of plaintiff's illegal act, which in this case. according to the proof, amounts to P210, this being the value of the corrals, etc., placed upon the leased premises by the lessee and appropriated by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The lessee was, as we have said, evicted about December 6. The trial court allowed recovery for the month of December, We think this was error. The ouster relieved the lessee from the payment of rent accruing after his possession ceased, but rent already accrued and overdue is not forfeited by the eviction. The rule that eviction suspends the payment of rent results from the meaning of the term \"rent\" and from the obligations of the relation between landlord and tenant. Rent is compensation for the use of land, and what the tenant pays rent for is quiet possession, or beneficial enjoyment. When, therefore, the use or possession ceases, the consideration for the payment ceases. (Grommes vs. St. Paul Trust Company, 147 111, 634, reported in 37 Am. St. Rep., 248; 1 Taylor's Land, and Ten. (eighth ed.), secs. 377, 378; 2 Wood's Landlord and Tenant (second ed.) sec. 477; 12 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law, 743; Morris vs. Tillson, 81 111., 607; Hall vs. Gould, 13 N. Y., 127; Home Life Insurance Company vs. Sherman, 46 N. Y., 370.) Consequently, the plaintiff is entitled to recover rent for five instead of six months.<br\/><br\/>The lessor and lessee agreed that in case the lessee failed to comply with the contract the lessor would be entitled to recover the same penalties as those imposed upon delinquent taxpayers, and also that the lessee would forfeit his deposit. There is nothing illegal or improper in this agreement, and there exists no reason why it should not be held valid. It was a material part of the contract, and is the law between the contracting parties.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendants appears to be of the opinion that under no circumstances can a judgment be entered against the lessee's bondsmen in this case for the reason that said bondsmen obligated themselves to pay the rents in case the lessee failed to pay by the end of the term of the lease, and for the further reason that the lessee was evicted before the said term expired. In reference to this point, it is sufficient to say that this action was not instituted until long after the full term of the lease had expired.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is hereby modified by allowing the plaintiff to recover for five months' rent, together with 20 per cent penalties thereon, and by deducting from this amount P210, the amount of the actual damages caused by the plaintiff's trespass. As thus modified, said judgment is affirmed with costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<\/div>",

But we are of  opinion that  the extenuating  circumstance set out in subsection 7 of article 9 should have been taken into consideration, and  that the prescribed penalty should have been imposed in its minimum degree.  Subsection 7 of article 9 is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The following are extenuating circumstances:<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">*       *       *       *      *      *      *<\/p>\n<p>\"That of having acted upon an impulse so powerful as naturally to have produced passion and obfuscation.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The evidence  clearly discloses that the convict, in the heat of passion, killed the deceased, who had theretofore been his <em>querida <\/em>(concubine or lover) upon discovering her <em>in  flagrante<\/em>  in  carnal  communication  with  a  mutual acquaintance.  We think that under the circumstances the convict  was entitled to have this fact taken into consideration in  extenuation of his offense under the provisions of the above-cited article. This was the view taken by the supreme court of Spain upon a similar state of facts as set forth in its sentence of July 4,  1892,  which  is summarized by Viada  (p. 69, in question 19, art. 9 of vol. 6) as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Shall he who kills a woman with whom he is living in concubinage for having caught her in her underclothes with another party and afterwards shoots himself, inflicting a serious  wound, be responsible for that  crime with the extenuating circumstance of having acted with violent passion and obfuscation?  The Audiencia of Santiago de Cuba did not so hold and its judgment was reversed by the supreme court for improper disregard of article 9, number 8, of the Penal Code for Cuba and Puerto Rico: 'The facts held to be true by  the trial court, and which were the immediate cause of the crime by producing in the accused strong  emotion which impelled him to the criminal act and even to attempt his own life, were a sufficient impulse in the natural and ordinary course to produce the violent passion and obfuscation which the law regards as a special reason for extenuation, and as the judgment did not take into consideration the 8th circumstance of article 9 of the code, the Audiencia rendering it seems to have violated this legal provision.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It is  true that in the  case of  U. S. vs. Hicks (14 Phil. Rep., 217), we held that the \"causes which mitigate the criminal responsibility for the loss of self-control are such as originate from legitimate feelings, not those which arise from vicious, unworthy, and immoral passions,\" and declined to give the benefit of the provisions of this article to the convict in that  case on the ground that the alleged causes for his loss of self-control did not \"originate from legitimate feelings.\"   But  in that case we found as facts that :<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"All the foregoing circumstances conclusively prove that the accused, deliberately and after due reflection  had resolved to kill the woman who had left him for another man, and in order to  accomplish his  perverse intention  with safety, notwithstanding  the fact that he was already provided  with a clean and  well-prepared weapon  and carried other loaded cartridges besides those already in his revolver, he  entered the  house, greeting everyone  courteously and conversed with his victim, in what appeared to be a proper manner,  disguising his  intention  and calming her by his apparent repose and tranquility, doubtless in order to successfully accomplish his  criminal design, behaving himself properly as he had planned to do beforehand.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the former case the cause of the alleged \"passion and obf uscation\" of the aggressor was the convict's vexation, disappointment and deliberate anger engendered by the refusal of the woman to continue to live in illicit relations with him, which she  had a perfect right to do; his reason for killing her being merely that he had elected to leave him and with his full knowledge to go and live with another man.   In the present case however, the impulse upon which  defendant acted and which naturally \"produced passion and obfuscation\" was not that the woman declined to have illicit  relations with  him,  but the sudden revelation that she was untrue to him, and his discovery of her <em>in flagrante<\/em> in the arms of another. As said by  the supreme court of Spain in the above  cited decision, this was a  \"sufficient impulse\" in the ordinary and natural course of things to produce the passion and  obf uscation which the law  declares to be one of the extenuating circumstances to be taken into consideration by the  court.<\/p>\n<p>Modified by a finding that the commission of the crime was marked with the extenuating circumstance set out in subsection 7 of article 9, and by the reduction of the penalty of fourteen years eight months and one  day of <em>reclusion temporal<\/em> to twelve years and one day of <em>reclusion temporal<\/em>, the judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial court should be and are hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p>\n<em>Arellano, C.

The\u00a0 facts seem to be as\u00a0 follows:<\/p><p> First. That on the 13th of November, 1910, the defendant was\u00a0 vice-president of the municipality of Taburan in the Province of Cebu.<\/p><p> Second.\u00a0 That\u00a0 Anastacio Bragat was a\u00a0 policeman in the said municipality on said date.<\/p><p> Third. That on said date one Eduardo Mendoza was the president of the municipality of Taburan.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>Fourth. That on the said 13th of November, 1910, a complaint was presented to the president of said municipality, signed by Visitacion Esmero, charging the said Anastacio Bragat with the crime of larceny of nine pieces of jewelry. This complainant alleged that she believed that the jewelry was then in the trunk of the said Anastacio Bragat in his house.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Fifth. That by reason of the\u00a0 parentage or relationship which existed between the president of the said municipality and the complainant,\u00a0 Visitacion Esmero, the former referred the complaint to the vice-president, the defendant herein, of said municipality, for action.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Sixth. That immediately\u00a0 upon\u00a0 receiving the\u00a0 order of the president, the vice-president ordered\u00a0 the\u00a0 said Anastacio Bragat, the policeman, detained\u00a0 in the municipal building. The vice-president also ordered the\u00a0 justice of\u00a0 the\u00a0 peace to issue a search warrant for the\u00a0 purpose of searching the house of\u00a0 said policeman.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Seventh. It appears further that\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the morning of the\u00a0 14th of November, 1910,\u00a0 the said Visitacion Esmero appeared in the office of the president of the said pueblo and withdrew her complaint, upon the ground that she had found the jewelry which she\u00a0 believed Anastacio Bragat had stolen.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>Eighth. Upon the presentation of the said written statement of Visitacion Esmero, the defendant\u00a0 herein\u00a0 directed that further proceedings against Anastacio Bragat be dispensed with.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>During the trial of the cause Anastacio Bragat attempted to show that he had been illegally and arbitrarily deprived of his liberty from early in the morning\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 13th\u00a0 of November, 1910, until sometime in the morning of the 14th of November, 1910; that the period\u00a0 of his illegal detention was something less\u00a0 than twenty-four\u00a0 hours.\u00a0\u00a0 Anastacio Bragat attempted to\u00a0 show that\u00a0 he had been\u00a0 detained\u00a0 in <em>\"incomunicado<\/em>\"\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant, as\u00a0 well as the justice of the peace of said pueblo, declared as witnesses and attempted to show that the detention of the said Anastacio Bragat was not in \"<em>incomunicado<\/em>;\" that he was detained in the municipal building simply, until the officials of said pueblo could make an investigation of the charges preferred against him.\u00a0\u00a0 We think\u00a0 that the evidence shows that he was de- tained in the municipal\u00a0 building,\u00a0 but that\u00a0 he was not detained in <em>\"incomunicado<\/em>.\"\u00a0 The evidence\u00a0 shows that his querida slept with him\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 municipal building on the night of the 13th of November.<\/p><p> Article 200 of the Penal Code provides that any public officer who arrests a person without authority of law or by virtue of some regulation of a general character in force in the Philippines, <em>except it be for the commission\u00a0 of a crime,<\/em> shall\u00a0 be punished by a\u00a0 fine of\u00a0 not less than 325 and not more than 3,250\u00a0 pesetas,\u00a0 if the detention shall not\u00a0 have exceeded three days, etc.<\/p><p> In the present case the complaint presented by Visitacion Esmero charged the said Anastacio Bragat with the crime of larceny.\u00a0\u00a0 This complaint was referred by the president of the pueblo to the vice-president, the defendant herein, for action.\u00a0 While it may not have been necessary to\u00a0 have ordered the detention of the said Anastacio Bragat, under the circumstances, and while, as a matter of fact, his detention was not authorized at all in the manner in which it was done, and under the circumstances, yet, nevertheless, it does not seem to us that the defendant herein detained the said Anastacio Bragat arbitrarily.\u00a0\u00a0 Visitacion Esmero alleged that Anastacio Bragat had\u00a0 stolen her jewelry; that the same\u00a0 was in his trunk in his house.\u00a0 It may have been that the vice-president,\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 herein,\u00a0 believing\u00a0 the charges of the said Visitacion Esmero, ordered the defendant at once to remain in the municipal building for the purpose of preventing his removing the said jewelry from his trunk. At all events, and taking into consideration all\u00a0 of the circumstances surrounding\u00a0 the alleged detention of Anastacio Bragat, we are of the opinion that the evidence does not show\u00a0 that Jose Figueroa, the defendant herein, did\u00a0 maliciously, criminally and without motive, arbitrarily detain Anastacio Bragat in the manner described in the complaint.<\/p><p> This court has held in the case of U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Gonzaga\u00a0 (4 Phil. Rep., 364) that\u00a0 article 200 of the Penal Code has no application to a case where the person arrested is charged with a crime and is arrested on account thereof.\u00a0 (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Gonzaga, 3 Phil. Rep., 135.)\u00a0\u00a0 Had there been no charges preferred against the said Anastacio Bragat, charging him with a crime, then perhaps his detention\u00a0 would have been arbitrary and illegal.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Agravante, 10 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 46;\u00a0 U. S. <em>vs.<\/em>\u00a0 Braganza, 10 Phil. Rep., 79;\u00a0 U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Gellada, 15 Phil. Rep., 120:)<\/p><p> For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that the sentence of the lower\u00a0 court should\u00a0 be\u00a0 reversed, the complaint dismissed and the defendant discharged from the custody of the law.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

Therefore the subject matter of this action can only be this coSwnership, if it exists, in which the hereditary estate was left, and, if it does so exist,  the partition of the property among the four  lawful  coowners, the  heirs of Lucio Agtarap, and withdrawal of Silverio's  portion in order to transfer it to his intestate estate.<\/p>\n<p>According to law,  one-fourth of this property belongs to Silverio Agtarap.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the court below directs:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That one-fourth  part of this property be delivered to the administrator of the intestate estate of the late Silverio Agtarap, as his legacy,  so that, after proper proceedings, their respective portions may be adjudicated to the  widow and other heirs of the said Silverio; without special finding as to costs.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This judgment is entirely in accordance with law. The plaintiff also asked for the portion of the products of the coownership corresponding to Silverio Agtarap, but the trial court ignored this  request, as well as that for some cattle included in  the complaint, and the plaintiff has not appealed with  regard to this omission,  so it need  not be considered here. The judgment rightly says that after the proper proceed- ings under the law, there may be adjudicated to the  widow and other heirs of Silverio Agtarap, in due -proportion, the fourth part which the  defendants should  deliver  to  the administrator of the intestate estate  of the said Silverio Agtarap; but not in  this action.  The necessary procedure will be  the special proceedings in the intestate estate of Silverio Agtarap, in which may properly be presented the claim of the administrator  of the said intestate estate on behalf of Juana Domingo for her \"legal portion as widow,\" as well as the proceedings for proving that Eugenia Agtarap is a legitimate daughter in  order to have her declared the sole heir of the whole of the said fourth part of the property which corresponds to him whom  she calls her legitimate father.  In  the trial held for such purpose it will  be de- termined who are the heirs  of the intestate estate  of  Silerio Agtarap; whether she who calls herself his legitimate daughter, Eugenia Agtarap; or his brothers Cornelio and Nicolas and his nephew  Melecio, all surnamed Agtarap.<\/p>\n<p>The lawful usufruct pertaining to the widow will depend upon whether  the alleged daughter  or  the  brothers and nephew of the  deceased are entitled to the inheritance, for if she who  claims to  be  the daughter, Eugenia Agtarap, be declared the sole heir of the deceased  Silverio Agtarap, the widow's share would be different from what it would if the defendants in this case, as brothers and nephew  of  the deceased Silverio  Agtarap,  are  declared  to be  the  sole heirs - in  accordance with  the  various  provisions  of  the Civil Code in this respect.<\/p>\n<p>Only in such special proceedings, wherein the necessary orders can be issued and executed, can findings be made as to who are the heirs and what portions belong to them,  the nature  of their titles, and  in case of usufruct wjiat part pertains to each.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants.<\/p>\n<em>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<div align=\"center\"><br\/>\n<em>DISSENTING<\/em><\/div>\n<p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The real, estate which constitutes the subject matter of this action descended, on the death  of Lucio Agtarap, to four heirs, Silverio, Cornelio, Nicolas and Melecio,  whose interests are here in litigation.  Later Silverio died, leaving, it is claimed, a wife and child.  There were no debts.   No one was in any sense interested in the property save the heirs.   The property was never divided among the heirs,<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Therefore the sole basis of the action is this joint ownership,  if it exists, in  which the estate was left and, if it is true, the division of the property among the four joint legal  owners, heirs of Lucio Agtarap, setting apart the portion belonging to Silverio for his estate.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The judgment of the court below; as stated by this court, was: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That one-fourth part of this property (real estate)  be delivered to the administrator of the intestate estate of the late Silverio Agtarap as heir, so that, upon proper proceedings, there may be adjudicated to the widow and heirs of the said Silverio their respective portions.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>As to this judgment of the  trial court, this court in  its opinion says: \"This judgment is entirely in accordance with law.\"<\/p>\n<p>We have here, then, the principle asserted that an administrator has power to commence and prosecute an action of partition of real estate among the heirs of  the decedent. In this case, we have the administrator of one heir suing the other three heirs for a one-quarter interest;  and  the judgment of the trial court, affirmed by this  court, giving the administrator the one-fourth part sued for and ordering its  delivery by the defendants.  This court says that this is not a suit in ejectment  to  recover all of  the  premises pending a settlement  of the estate.  Nor, says the court, is it an action  to obtain possession  of  a one-fourth part already  set off.  The ownership of the heirs is  that  of tenants in common.   The property, has never  been  divided. Neither  is it, under the holding of  this court, an action to compel the  defendants to permit participation of the other heir in the possession in common.  The decision  of this court indisputably negatives such a theory.  The court clearly holds the action to be one of partition.<\/p>\n<p>I repeat, then, that this court,  by the opinion I am criticising, asserts the proposition that an administrator of an estate may commence  and prosecute an action of par- tition and compel a division of the real estate of his decedent among the heirs., So  far as my researches go, this is the first time that such a proposition has.been asserted by any court.   Even among the States  which have, by statute, gone to extremes |n giving administrators control over real estate, no legislature or court has ever given such power or right except those of Louisiana, and  then only in specified cases.

The persons and the only persons authorized to bring such an action are those  mentioned in section 181 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  It reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Partition of  real estate.  A person having or holding real estate with others, in any  form of joint tenancy, or tenancy in  common, may compel partition thereof in the manner hereinafter prescribed.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>From  the provisions  of  the  Code of  Civil  Procedure relating to the partition of real estate it is apparent that partition on the petition  of  an administrator was never contemplated.<\/p>\n<p>Article 1052 of the Civil Code reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Every coheir having the  free administration and  dis- posal of his property may at  any time request the division of the estate.<\/p>\n<p>\"The legal representatives  of incapacitated persons  and absentees must request the division in their name.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Articles 1058 and 1059 are  as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Should the testator not have made any division,  nor intrusted this power to another, if the  heirs should be of age and should have the free  administration of their prop- erty,  they may distribute the estate  in the manner they may see fit.<\/p>\n<p>\"If the heirs of age should not agree as to  the manner of making the division, they shall be free to enforce their rights in the manner prescribed in the law of civil procedure.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The Civil Code does not authorize such  an action as  the present.<\/p>\n<p>It is evident, then, that the present action of partition was instituted without authority of law, was not begun by the real party in interest, and was  commenced and carried on without the consent of some of the real parties in interest. A judgment in a partition action in which one of the real persons in interest is not a party is substantially fruitless. (59 L. R. A., 748.)<\/p>\n<p>But, to me, this is not the strangest part of this decision. It seems to me to hold finally,  in effect, that this action and the judgment therein is of no significance anyway; that, after  the action has  been begun, the parties and witnesses in court, the  cause  tried, and the judgment  rendered, nothing of any  consequence  has been  accomplished.   It either holds this, or else  it holds something, to  me, more incomprehensible, to which I shall call attention as my third and last objection to  the decision as it stands.   The court says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"After<\/em> the proper proceedings under the law, let there be adjudicated to the widow and the heirs of Silverio Agtarap, in proper portions, the fourth part which the defendants should deliver to the  administrator of the intestate estate of said  Silverio  Agtarap;  but not in this  action (<em>sic<\/em>). The necessary prior proceedings will occur in the special proceedings of the  intestate estate of  Silverio Agtarap in which will be proper  the claim made by the administrator of the said estate  on behalf of Juana  Domingo for her 'legal portion,' and  also the  proceedings for the filiation of Eugenia  Agtarap and to have  her declared the universal heir of the whole of the said fourth part which corresponds to the person she calls her  legitimate  father.  Therein it will be determined,  on the hearing of that matter, who are the  heirs of the intestate estate of Silverio Agtarap,  and whether  the person denominated the legitimate daughter, Eugenia  Agtarap,  is  the heir,  or whether  the brothers of Silverio Agtarap,  namely,  Cornelio, Nicolas and his nephew Melecio, all  of the surname Agtarap, are the heirs. And when it is shown whether the said pretended daughter, or the brother arid nephew of the deceased, are entitled to the property,  then the lawful usufruct of the widow will appear.   If the alleged daughter were declared the universal heir of the  deceased Silverio Agtarap,  a certain portion would go to the widow, while her share would be different  if the defendants, as brothers  and nephew of Silverio, are declared to be the universal heirs - in accordance with the various provisions of the Civil Code.   Only in such Special proceedings can the necessary orders be given and carried out and the  conclusions  be  reached as to the heirs and their  shares and what part corresponds to each.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>From this quotation  it is clear that, notwithstanding this solemn adjudication, no one knows what is going to happen until further proceedings are had in the probate court, for, says the opinion:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Only  in such  special proceedings can the necessary orders be given and carried out <em>and the conclusions be reached as to the heirs and their shares and what part cor- responds  to each.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>If this is so, what was the use of bringing the present action and what part does the formal judgment of this court play in the matter ?  If there must be \"further proceedings\" in a different court to determine who the heirs are, how many  there are, and  what their shares are,  can any one explain what possible consequence can be attached to this action and to the judgment of this or the trial court therein? If the  trial  court  was incompetent to  determine in this action the very thing for which the  action was brought, and  the decision of this and the trial  court expressly says that only the  probate court can  determine it, what was the purpose in bringing this  action? Of  what efficacy is the decision of the trial court therein and  what is the purpose of the solemn judgment of this  court in the premises?   If the whole essence of the case must still go to the probate court to be determined, as the decision says it must, what useless labor have we incurred and what fatuous judgment have we rendered ?  If what the court  says in its own decision is true, then its own  decision is without effect or consequence.<\/p>\n<p>But  even this is  not the strangest part of this decision, as it appears to me.  If it has any force or effect whatever, then we have this court holding  that an action partitioning real  estate1 may be begun in one court and terminated in another; that while one court directs the proceedings and finds the facts, another declares  the judgment on what may be altogether  different facts; that while the probate court is ordered to  take  the evidence and determine therefrom the facts  and the  law applicable thereto, such proceeding is without result because this court has already found the facts, applied the law and prejudged the case.<\/p>\n<p>In demonstration of the foregoing I present again the quotation  above, made from the decision of this court.  The decision says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The judgment in the court below is: 'That <em>one-fourth part<\/em> of this property be delivered to the administrator of the intestate estate of the late Silverio Agtarap as heir, so that, upon proper proceedings, there may be adjudicated to the widow  and heirs  of said Silverio their respective portions.  Without finding  as to costs.'  This  judgment is entirely in accordance with law.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It is  evident that  this court,  then, <em>adjudicates to the, alleged widow and  heir of Silverio<\/em>,  as well as the administrator in this case, <em>one-fourth of the land in question,<\/em> and this although the alleged widow and heir are not, so  far as appears in the decision, parties to the action.  The  court then states that the probate court is the only court which is competent to determine whether or not the woman who claims to be the wife of Silverio is really such  and whether the  person who claims to be the heir of  Silverio is in fact his  heir, saying that such court  is the only tribunal in which \"the  conclusions can be reached as to the heirs and their shares and what part corresponds to each.\"  It further states that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"When it is shown whether the said pretended daughter, or the brothers and the nephew of the deceased, are entitled to the property,<\/em> then the lawful usufruct of the widow will appear.   If the alleged daughter were declared the universal heir of the deceased  Silverio  Agtarap, a certain portion would go to the widow, while her share would be different if the defendants, as brothers and nephew of the said Silverio, are declared to be the universal heirs   *  *  *.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Observe the situation.   This court asserts, in the quoted part of this decision, (1) that neither it nor the trial court has any power to determine in this action, or in any other, who are the heirs of Silverio, and yet <em>it has decreed a one-fourth interest to  the  widow and heir of Silverio.<\/em>  It also holds (2) that the probate court is  the only court which can determine who the heirs are and what their shares are, it being the only court which has jurisdiction  or power to make a declaration of heirship; <em>and yet this court has found and declared the heirs and made an adjudication as to their shares.<\/em>   It holds that this court has no power to  do  anything\" in  this action and  yet  does  everything which any court could possibly do.  All power to act in the premises is, by the opinion, turned over to the probate court, and yet this court forecloses its action by making an adjudication in the shape of a final judgment stating who the heirs are and awarding them their  shares.  So that no matter what the probate court finds, as to the facts or the law, it has no power to act, as the prior judgment of this  court finding the heirs and adjudicating the shares is conclusive upon it.  To illustrate: The probate court is ordered by this court to take evidence  an($ determine whether the alleged heir of Sllverio is really such or not.   Now, if the pretended heir is found to be illegitimate, that fact may demonstrate also that the deceased  and the alleged widow were never married and that  she is, therefore, not his widow. But if there  is neither widow nor child, then the brothers and nephew of Silverio are entitled  to the whole property,   But this court, affirming the decision  of the  court below, <em>has already decreed that Silverio's  alleged widow and child are entitled to a one-fourth share in said lands and has decreed its delivery to the administrator for them.<\/em> If that decision is effective, then the probate court is bound by it, and his proceeding for the declaration of heirship and the adjudication of the shares to the heirs is a farce, as, no matter what he may find, he can adjudicate nothing different from  what this court has already determined by final judgment.  No matter if the probate court found that the alleged widow was no widow and the alleged heir no heir and that, therefore, Cornelio, Nicolas and Melecio were  entitled to all of the property, such court is utterly  powerless to grant them all of the  property, for there stares him in the face always the final judgment of this court <em>awarding them only three-quarters.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In its decision the trial court found:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That Eugenia Agtarap is the legitimate daughter of the lawful marriage of Silverio Agtarap and Juana Domingo, such fact appearing in the baptismal record made in the year 1892 and  not attacked by anybody from that day to'this; and whose force and effect cannot be destroyed by the testimony of the witnesses for the defense to the effect that said Eugenia is not the daughter of said spouses but  of  other persons.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The trial court further says that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"With the death of Lucio Agtarap the following persons became heirs in equal parts of his property: Cornelio and Nicolas, being sons, by their own right,  and Melecio and Eugenia by representation, they being grandchildren.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Then follows the judgment of the court ordering the delivery of a one-fourth part of t]ae lands to the administrator, not to Eugenia.   This court in the judgment of affirmance says, as we have already seen,  that  the  one-fourth part is turned  over to the administrator for the  purpose of having the probate court, which,  says this court, is the only court competent for that purpose, proceed  and determine whether Juana  Domingo was the lawful wife of Silverio, a fact already determined by the court below in this case and  affirmed by this court, and  whether Eugenia  is his lawful child, a fact also already determined in this very case by the court below and affirmed by this court.   The proceeding in the probate court is ordered to the end that the rights of the parties in the property may be determined and their respective shares adjudicated to each, things already done by two courts.   Two  courts have  already adjudicated a one-fourth part of the lands to the administrator for the use of  Eugenia and the widow, and ordered its  delivery to the administrator.  How  can the  probate court possibly effect these two decisions, especially the final judgment  of this court, even though he find that  Juana and Silverio were never married, that their relations  were adulterous,  scandalous and criminal, and that Eugenia is  illegitimate, and neither the  one nor the other has the slightest interest in the lands of Silverio, but that such lands belong wholly  to  Cornelio, Nicolas and  Melecio?   How can  he reverse the final judgment  of  this court which definitely holds and  adjudicates, in terms, that Cornelio, Nicolas and Melecio are entitled to only three-quarters, Eugenia taking the other quarter?<\/p>\n<p>The proposition laid down in this decision relative to the probate  court being the only court competent to declare heirship (a proposition which, by the way, reestablishes the old system of the declaration of heirship), that is,  to determine in a given case who the heirs are and what their shares in property are, is, in my  judgment,  untenable.<\/p>\n<p>It is evident that there  appears in this case no reason whatever why  an administrator should  have been appointed.  As I liave said, there was not a debt outstanding against the estate and the estate held no claim against anyone.  No one was interested in the real estate except the heirs.  An action of partition between the heirs themselves, or an action by  one heir against the others to compel participation in possession, would have been the proper proceeding.  The appointment of an administrator under such circumstances was without authority  of law, was  unnecessary, entailed a useless expense,  and served no  purpose. The cases which come before this court demonstrate to my satisfaction that the power of the court to appoint  administrators is made use of far too often.  An administrator should never be appointed unless there is some third person to whom the estate is indebted  or who is indebted to the estate; and even in such  case the appointment should be made only  after every effort has been made to adjust the matter without such appointment  Under the law an administrator should not be appointed just because some one asks for the  appointment.  Where there is no controversy except among the heirs themselves, an administrator should not  be appointed.  Heirs  who  do not  agree have  their remedy, one  against the other, in the ordinary actions or proceedings provided by law.   Where the appointment of an administrator is asked for  under such circumstances, it is  the duty of the court to  deny the application and advise the applicant that he has a  remedy entirely adequate under other provisions of the law.   An administrator is not the representative  of  one set  of heirs as against another nor of the heirs as a  whole.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Among his heirs he left a son named Pedro Pena.\u00a0 When the estate of Clemente Pena was divided, Pedro Pena had already died and his daughter, named Francisca Pena, received his portion of the inheritance.\u00a0\u00a0 She was\u00a0 then a minor\u00a0 and a guardian, Ramon Ortiz, was appointed, and the latter\u00a0 took over and administered the property that had come to Francisca Pena, through her father, from the estate of the aforesaid Clemente Pena.\u00a0 Francisca Pena married Eulogio\u00a0 Tria and died March 2, 1902.<p> After the death of Francisca Pena, her surviving husband, Eulogio Tria, made application,\u00a0 on January 13, 1903, for the appointment of a judicial administrator\u00a0 for the intestate estate of his late wife,\u00a0 and was himself\u00a0 appointed.\u00a0\u00a0 He presented an inventory of the\u00a0 property of the deceased, which inventory\u00a0 included seven parcels of\u00a0 land.\u00a0 But commissioners of appraisal\u00a0 were\u00a0 appointed\u00a0 and\u00a0 appraised thirty-four parcels, and there the proceedings of that administration terminated.<\/p><p> On January 18, 1907, Gavina Fernandez also made special application for the appointment of an administration for the property which Pedro Pefia had left at his decease, by a will executed and\u00a0 probated under the late sovereignty. and the petitioner herself, Gavina Fernandez, widow of the said Pedro Pena, was appointed.\u00a0 In the same instrument she asked for the partition of the estate of Pedro Pena, and there the proceedings terminated.<\/p><p> Later, on July 23, 1908, Gavina Fernandez, as such judicial administratrix, instituted the present suit praying for judgment in her favor and\u00a0 against the defendant for the ownership and possession\u00a0 of the property set forth in the complaint, for P2,000 damages and the costs.<\/p><p> The material facts of the complaint are: the third, wherein it\u00a0 is averred that the hereditary succession of the deceased Pedro Pena is the owner and is entitled to ownership and possession of the property which is then described, to wit,\u00a0 according to the fourth fact, seven parcels of rural land,\u00a0 and five horses, the condition of the\u00a0 latter being a matter of surmise (B. of e., 2 and 3);\u00a0 and\u00a0 the fifth, in which it is averred\u00a0 that\u00a0 the defendant Eulogio Tria,\u00a0 as judicial administrator of the property left by the deceased Francisca Pena (second fact) illegally retains, in his possession the property described in the complaint and claims to have rights therein adverse to those of the plaintiff.<\/p><p> In his reply the defendant confines himself to a generaldenial.<\/p><p> From the evidence adduced, the Court of First Instance of Ambos Camarines, which tried the case, decided it \"in favor of the plaintiff\u00a0 in her capacity as administratrix for the deceased Pedro Pena, declaring that\u00a0 she\u00a0 was entitled\u00a0 to possession during the probate proceedings with reference to the real property described in the complaint and ordering the defendant to deliver it to her.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (B. of e., 8 and 9).<\/p><p> The defendant prepared a bill of exceptions and appealed to this court, submitting the following assignments of error:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><ol><li>In\u00a0 having declared\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff-administratrix owner of the land sought.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <li>\u00a0In\u00a0 denying the\u00a0 request for a new trial on the ground that the judgment is not\u00a0 sustained by the evidence.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 <\/li><\/ol><p> With reference\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 first assignment, the trial court made no declaration\u00a0 of ownership.\u00a0 It merely stated the conclusion that the plaintiff, as administratrix of the estate of Pedro Pena, was entitled\u00a0 to possession of the property described in the complaint so that she might act as <em>administratrix during <\/em>the probate proceedings\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 estate of Pedro Pena, and that\u00a0 when the debts had been paid, if any existed, and said proceedings\u00a0 were terminated, the property remaining should be divided among the heirs;

that,\u00a0 although the\u00a0 complaint alleges that\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant administrator is in possession of the lands, that allegation\u00a0 is denied by the answer, and there is no legal proof in the evidence showing the possession alleged.\u00a0\u00a0 The only witness who testified for the plaintiff on\u00a0 that subject was Emilio\u00a0 Fuentebella who said\u00a0 that he <em>supposed or concluded<\/em> that the\u00a0 possession was by\u00a0 Eulogio as adminstrator <em>simply because\u00a0 he was administrator<\/em>.\u00a0 On the contrary, all\u00a0 the\u00a0 facts\u00a0 and circumstances show that Eulogio\u00a0 Tria and his\u00a0 minor son\u00a0 are\u00a0 in\u00a0 possession of the lands in question as heirs and owners and have been since the death of the wife and\u00a0 mother in 1902.\u00a0 In fact, this court finds as a fact that the administration of the estate of Francisca by her husband,\u00a0 Eulogio,\u00a0 as\u00a0 administrator, <em>terminated in 1903<\/em>.\u00a0 The court says:<\/p><blockquote><p> \"After the death of Francisca Pena, her widower Eulogio Tria made application, on\u00a0 January\u00a0 13, 1903, for the appointment of a judicial administrator for the\u00a0 intestate estate of his late wife, and\u00a0 was himself appointed.\u00a0 He presented an inventory of\u00a0 the\u00a0 property of the deceased, which inventory\u00a0 included\u00a0 seven\u00a0 parcels\u00a0 of land.\u00a0 But commissioners of\u00a0 appraisal were\u00a0 appointed\u00a0 and appraised thirty-four parcels, and there the proceedings of that

of Eulogio Tria and his son,\u00a0 Buenaventura, from the possession\u00a0 of the land in dispute.\u00a0 Moreover,\u00a0 if\u00a0 the defendant administrator is the representative of the\u00a0 heirs,\u00a0 then his expulsion from possession is equivalent, legally, to the expulsion of the heirsthemselves.\u00a0\u00a0 I therefore treat the matter from the point of view of the heirs

the Islands\u00a0 the\u00a0 theory of the court\u00a0 being that, when heirs or devisees differ over their respective rights in real estate, such real estate should. by means of\u00a0 the appointment of an administrator, be <em>taken away from all<\/em>.\u00a0 This ignores the rights of owners of lands to settle their disputes' between themselves or by appealing to the court\u00a0 in person.\u00a0 It is the forcible appointment of a guardian for every\u00a0 person who happens to be an heir and does not agree with his coheirs.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>\u00a0 Because 4 it lays\u00a0 down\u00a0 the proposition, and lays\u00a0 it down as the policy of the law of administration in this country, that one can\u00a0 do\u00a0 by indirection what he cannot do by direction.\u00a0 Gavina Fernandez\u00a0 being\u00a0 the\u00a0 owner of an undivided half of the real estate in question, and that is all she claims, and Eulogio and Buenaventura being the owners of the other undivided\u00a0 half, it is a principle unquestioned anywhere that Gavina could not dispossess them by any action or proceeding known to the law.\u00a0 One tenant in common cannot <em>legally\u00a0 dispossess<\/em> his\u00a0 fellow\u00a0 tenant in common.\u00a0 Their rights are equal, and equal rights cannot in law or justice produce unequal results.\u00a0\u00a0 Both are entitled to possession, but not one alone.\u00a0 Not being able,\u00a0 then, to dispossess the defendants by direct attack, Gavina astutely takes the path of indirection.\u00a0 She procures the appointment of an administrator; and lo,\u00a0 a miracle is wrought, a right which\u00a0 never\u00a0 existed before\u00a0 was\u00a0 born, namely\u00a0 the\u00a0 right to drive from possession those whose rights in the premises from which they are expelled <em>are\u00a0 inferior\u00a0 to those\u00a0 of no man<\/em>.\u00a0\u00a0 Prior\u00a0 to speaking the mysterious\u00a0 and portentous words which created the administration, all the powers of the estate\u00a0 could\u00a0 not have\u00a0 dispossessed them.\u00a0 There were no rights greater than theirs.\u00a0 There was no justice that they did not share.\u00a0 There was no one who could drive them from their home.\u00a0 In spite of all this, the administratrix passes her\u00a0 magic wand over this legal vacuum, this\u00a0 receptacle, this space in which there is nothing,\u00a0 and behold, it\u00a0 is peopled with powers.\u00a0 Where there was\u00a0 nothing before, there is something now.\u00a0\u00a0 Where, before, there was nothing which could expel a person from land which he owned (and had\u00a0 possessed for seventeen years\u00a0 without\u00a0 challenge), now there is a strange creature of the law which, without ownership, dispossesses the owner,\u00a0 without right overcomes the rightful, and with nothing takes all.\u00a0 By the utterance of a single word, \"appointed,\" the king becomes the beggar. Where direction\u00a0 is unsuccessful, the devious ways of indirection meet success.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>\u00a0 Because, while giving miraculous\u00a0 virtues to the appointment\u00a0 of an administrator in one case, it gives none whatever to such appointment in another.\u00a0 If the appointment of Gavina Fernandez as administratrix of the estate of Pedro Pena produces such miraculous results, why does not the appointment of\u00a0 Eulogio Tria\u00a0 as administrator\u00a0 of the estate of Francisca Pena produce results equally miraculous ? It is certain that Francisca Pena was just as much the owner of her real estate as Pedro Pena was of his; and therefore if the administrator\u00a0 of Pedro Pena can take his real estate away from everybody regardless of owners' rights, of law, equity, justice and everything else, why cannot the administrator of Francisca Pena do the same\u00a0 thing with the real estate which she left?\u00a0 If the administratrix of Pedro is an irresistible force as to the\u00a0 real\u00a0 property of Pedro, why is not the administrator of Francisca an irresistible force as to the real estate of Francisca?\u00a0\u00a0 This court, as well as the court below,\u00a0 found the ownership of Francisca with the same force and effect as it found the ownership\u00a0 of Pedro. Why, then, should the administrator\u00a0 of Francisca give way to the\u00a0 administratrix of Pedro?\u00a0 If one can claim miraculous attributes, why cannot the other, and for\u00a0 the same reason?\u00a0 If one can succeed\u00a0 with\u00a0 nothing, why\u00a0 cannot the other?\u00a0 When two irresistible\u00a0 forces come together\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in opposition, the result is necessarily nil.\u00a0 If the administratrix of Pedro claims that she\u00a0 must take the real estate which\u00a0 he owned to\u00a0 administer\u00a0 it, the administrator\u00a0 of Francisca makes the same claim\u00a0 relative to the real estate which\u00a0 Francisca\u00a0 owned.\u00a0 If the administratrix of Pedro asserts that she must hold the real estate of Pedro during administration, so asserts the administrator of Francisca. Simply because Pedro Pena died first and Francisca's property came from him does not under the facts of this case give his administratrix superior powers over the administrator of Francisca.\u00a0 In reality there never was, in effect, an estate of Pedro\u00a0 Pena.\u00a0 The appointment seventeen years after\u00a0 his death was abortive.\u00a0\u00a0 The estate, if one ever came into existence, ceased to exist\u00a0 on the distribution of the\u00a0 property. (Sections 596, 597, Code of Civil Procedure; McMicking <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Sy Conbieng, 21 Phil. Rep., 211.)\u00a0\u00a0 The appointment in 1907 could not give life to something which,\u00a0 if it was ever born, died in 1890; nor can it destroy a status created by the division of the estate and a delivery of the property in 1890, which status obtained in 1907 when the futile\u00a0 appointment of plaintiff was made.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li> Because it deprives the owners of their rights of property without any\u00a0 beneficial result whatever.\u00a0\u00a0 What is the administratrix to do with this property?\u00a0 What can she do with it?\u00a0 Absolutely nothing.\u00a0 If\u00a0 it\u00a0 be said that the administratrix took it to divide between\u00a0 the devisees\u00a0 (a power attributed to an administrator which I deny, particularly relative to tenants in common, such proceedings being properly of partition under section 181 of\u00a0 the Code\u00a0 of\u00a0 Civil Procedure), <em>I reply that we do not knoxu\u00a0 that the devisees want to divide\u00a0 it<\/em>.\u00a0 There\u00a0 is not a particle\u00a0 of\u00a0 evidence in\u00a0 the record showing such a desire. <em>Indeed, the devisees are not even parties<\/em>.\u00a0 Surely the court will not divide real property among owners without their consent!\u00a0 If it be urged that the administratrix took it to ascertain who the owners are, I reply that the administratrix admits the ownership of Eulogio and Buenaventura.\u00a0 But, even\u00a0 if it be conceded that the administratrix took the property,\u00a0 and properly so, for the purposes mentioned,\u00a0 that does not in any sense or to any degree justify the dispossession of the owners.\u00a0\u00a0 Both of those ends could be attained just as well by leaving them in possession while the questions were being determined.\u00a0 And being the unquestioned owners of an undivided one-half interest\u00a0 and having been in unchallenged possession for more than seventeen years, are they not entitled, under every principle of justice and\u00a0 equity,\u00a0 to remain in possession until superior rights are shown?\u00a0\u00a0 I again put the question, Why should\u00a0 the administratrix take this property?\u00a0 The only possible answer is, \"Just to give it back again after she has fattened her fees at the expense of\u00a0 rights which should never have been disturbed.\"\u00a0 It is the old refrain of marching up the hill and marching\u00a0 down again.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li> Because so far as this\u00a0 action is concerned, it destroys the owners' rights in the property in question depriving them\u00a0 of legal\u00a0 virtue and effect and making them go for nought.\u00a0\u00a0 Their admitted\u00a0 ownership of an undivided half, their undisturbed possession for seventeen years, are given no effect, are accorded no legal virtue and go for nothing. In spite of these conceded rights, this decision strips them as naked as the veriest squatter.\u00a0 While such deprivation of rights may be limited in time, it is nevertheless a deprivation.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li> Because the only evidence\u00a0 presented in the case by the plaintiff to show the right\u00a0 which she asserts is the\u00a0 order appointing her administratrix.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no other evidence in the\u00a0 case\u00a0 on\u00a0 that subject.\u00a0\u00a0 The only proof which the administratrix offers to sustain her alleged rights is her naked appointment.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li> Because it lays down the doctrine, which I regard as a most unfortunate one, that the right of an administrator to the\u00a0 possession of the real estate of a decedent is <em>general and absolute<\/em> and not special and relative; and this\u00a0 court by this decision now and for the future drives absolute and conceded owners from the possession\u00a0 of their lands <em>on the mere proof of\u00a0 the appointment of an administrator,<\/em> without showing the\u00a0 existence of the special conditions\u00a0 upon which, in my judgment, the\u00a0 rights of an administrator in\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 real estate depend.\u00a0 This doctrine, enunciated so generally in this case, and,no other interpretation can be given to the decision, is not founded in the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure\u00a0 and is\u00a0 not\u00a0 supported, so far as I can ascertain,\u00a0 by a single Anglo-Saxon authority.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>Because it makes the administrator the representative of one heir as against another, thereby seriously misapprehending the\u00a0 nature\u00a0 and\u00a0 purpose of administration and\u00a0 the functions of\u00a0 an\u00a0 administrator.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>Because the decision holds that before anyone has any title or right to property whatever\u00a0 under the law of these Islands it must go to the administrator and be administered by him, and then passed through the court in the proceedings for division; <em>that\u00a0 before property belongs to an heir or devisee and before he has any right to it whatever, <\/em>it must go through the weary and expensive length of administration; that, although his ownership is admitted by\u00a0 everybody, and\u00a0 although\u00a0 there\u00a0 are no claims\u00a0 for\u00a0 or against the estate and no reason exists\u00a0 why an administrator should be appointed, yet the property is, nevertheless, taken\u00a0 from him, he is dispossessed of the use and occupation thereof, it\u00a0 is placed in a useless administration, and it is\u00a0 returned to him,\u00a0 after\u00a0 perhaps years, reduced\u00a0 by useless expense and the fees of the administrator.\u00a0 During all this time the administrator is promoting litigation.\u00a0 If the heir in possession believes that, in justice, he\u00a0 ought not to be driven out except\u00a0 by\u00a0 superior rights, and accordingly refuses to vacate, there must be a suit to put him out. Then there must be another to determine whether he is the son of his father or not and whether his father and mother were\u00a0 married.\u00a0 There\u00a0 must\u00a0 be still\u00a0 another\u00a0 hearing\u00a0 to ascertain what his share in the property\u00a0 is.\u00a0\u00a0 And all this, although every one of these facts thus determined may\u00a0 be and generally is admitted by everybody.\u00a0\u00a0 In this very case no one questions the rights of\u00a0 Eulogio and his son.\u00a0 Yet out they go.\u00a0\u00a0 The court says:<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 \"Until this time comes (until an administrator has been appointed,\u00a0 the property taken away from the real owners, placed in court, the\u00a0 heirs and their shares determined, and final order made for distribution), therefore, it cannot be determined which is the property or which the part thereof that belongs to the intestate estate of Francisca Pena, and until such time there is no property <em>belonging <\/em>to Francisca Pena or to Gavina Fernandez, but only property <em>belonging<\/em> to the intestate estate of Pedro Pena.<\/li><\/ol><blockquote><p> \"To assert rights of ownership and possession in favor of Francisca Pena before determining what the property, is which <em>may<\/em> fall to her from the estate\u00a0 of Pedro\u00a0 Pena seems to be a plain absurdity that does not require demonstration, just as there is no need for demonstrating that an effect cannot precede its\u00a0 cause.\u00a0 Francisca\u00a0 Pena\u00a0 and Gavina Fernandez\u00a0 are\u00a0 the successors in interest of the estate of Pedro Pena, their predecessor\u00a0 in interest,\u00a0 and Francisca Pena can hardly have private\u00a0 property derived\u00a0 from Pedro\u00a0 Pena's\u00a0 estate before such estate has been divided and before Francisca Pena and Gavina Fernandez have been legally assigned their respective portions.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> The\u00a0 opinion also\u00a0 says:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"In conformity\u00a0 with these provisions\u00a0 and in accordance with general principles of law, the plaintiff, Gavina\u00a0 Fernandez, as administratrix of the estate of Pedro Pena, has been able to say justly in her complaint that the hereditary succession of this deceased is the owner and is entitled to ownership and possession\u00a0 of the property,\u00a0 which\u00a0 is withheld by the defendant, Eulogio\u00a0 Tria.\u00a0 *\u00a0 * *.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> I regard the\u00a0 doctrine laid\u00a0 down\u00a0 in these quotations to be\u00a0 contrary to\u00a0 the\u00a0 proposition as already established\u00a0 by this court in several decisions.\u00a0\u00a0 I am of the opinion also that it is\u00a0 contrary to the\u00a0 provisions of the\u00a0 Civil Code and the decisions of\u00a0 the\u00a0 supreme court of Spain.\u00a0 Articles 657, 658 and 661 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Civil\u00a0 Code read as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p> \"The rights to the succession of a person are transmitted from the\u00a0 moment of his\u00a0 death.<\/p><p> \"Succession is granted\u00a0 either by the will of the man as expressed in a will or, in\u00a0 its absence,\u00a0 by provision of law.<\/p><p> \"The first is called testamentary the second legal succession.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0\"It may also be bestowed partly by will of man and partly by provision of\u00a0 law.<\/p><p> \"Heirs succeed the deceased in all\u00a0 his rights, and obligations\u00a0 by the mere fact of his death.\"<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 In a decision of the supreme court of Spain dated November 23, 1903, the court said:<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\"As has\u00a0 been\u00a0 repeatedly decided by this supreme court, the heir, as the\u00a0 successor of the deceased in\u00a0 all his rights and,obligations, has\u00a0 the\u00a0 power\u00a0 and\u00a0 the.right\u00a0 to\u00a0 demand what\u00a0 pertains to his interest, without reference to his co-heirs, whenever it is not to their prejudice and\u00a0 provided that he conforms to the laws regulating community of property.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> In another decision dated December 11 of the same year the court said:<\/p><blockquote><p> \"It is an ancient rule of our law, confirmed by article 661 of the Civil Code, that the heirs succeed by the mere fact of the death of\u00a0 their predecessor in\u00a0 interest.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> In\u00a0 the case of Pascual <em>vs.<\/em>\u00a0 Angeles (4 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 604) the court said: <\/p><blockquote><p>\"If the juridical

not\u00a0 extinguished by\u00a0 her death,\u00a0 he succeeded,\u00a0 then there is no doubt that the plaintiff, as testamentary successor of his deceased sister Ciriaca, as\u00a0 appears\u00a0 from the will on page 17 of the\u00a0 bill of exceptions, had a right to.oust the defendant,\u00a0 Angeles,\u00a0 for failure to pay the stipulated rent.

Frondosa (17 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 321), this court said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Under the provisions of the Civil\u00a0 Code (arts. 657-661), the rights\u00a0 to the succession of\u00a0 a person are transmitted from\u00a0 the moment of his\u00a0 death; in other words, the heirs succeeded immediately to all of the property of the deceased ancestor.\u00a0\u00a0 The property belongs to the heirs at the moment of the death of the ancestor as completely as if the ancestor had executed\u00a0 and delivered to them a deed for the same before his\u00a0 death.\u00a0 In the absence of debts existing against the estate, the heirs may enter upon the\u00a0 administration of the said property immediately.\u00a0 If they desire to administer it jointly,\u00a0 they\u00a0 may do\u00a0 so.\u00a0 If they desire\u00a0 to partition\u00a0 it among themselves\u00a0 and can do this\u00a0 by mutual\u00a0 agreement, they also have that privilege.\u00a0 The Code of Procedure in Civil Actions\u00a0 provides how\u00a0 an estate may\u00a0 be\u00a0 divided\u00a0 by a petition for\u00a0 partition in case they can not mutually agree in the division.\u00a0\u00a0 When there are no debts existing against the estate, there is certainly no occasion for the intervention of an administrator in the settlement and partition of the estate among\u00a0 the heirs.\u00a0 When\u00a0 the\u00a0 heirs are all\u00a0 of lawful age and there are no debts, there is no reason why the estate should\u00a0 be burdened with the costs and expenses of an\u00a0 administrator.\u00a0 The\u00a0 property belonging absolutely to the heirs, in the absence of existing debts against the estate, the administrator has no\u00a0 right\u00a0 to intervene in any way whatever\u00a0 in the division of the\u00a0 estate among the\u00a0 heirs. *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 If there are any heirs of the estate who have not received\u00a0 their participation,\u00a0 they have\u00a0 their remedy\u00a0 by petition for partition of\u00a0 the said estate.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> In the case\u00a0 of Malahacan, as administrator, <em>vs<\/em>.\u00a0 Ignacio and others (19\u00a0 Phil.

At the same time he told him to assume the responsibility for the theft of the said animal, of which he, Briones, and Carrido were accused, and to testify before the court that although he had designated one Estanislao as the thief, nevertheless he did not know the latter party and that the said Estanislao was not Estanislao Carrido, his codefendant. The result of this interview was that, on the hearing of the case half an hour afterwards, Fausto Briones repeated the previous statements that he had made in the preliminary investigation and testified that the animal in question was delivered to him by his coaccused, Estanislao Carrido; adding that although he received the said ten pesos from Jose Laserna for the accomplishment of the purpose desired by the latter, he had not, however, promised Laserna that he would denj his, witness's, previous testimony against Carrido.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons, the provincial fiscal, on November 26 of that year, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Tayabas, wherein he charged Jose Laserna with the crime of subornation of perjury. The cause being instituted, the court, in view of the evidence adduced, rendered judgment, on December 5 following, sentencing Jose Laserna to the penalty of three months' imprisonment and to the payment of a fine of P50, and, in case of insolvency, to twenty days' subsidiary imprisonment, to disqualification from holding public office for a period of two years and for an equal term, from giving testimony before the courts of these Islands, except in cases where the defendant should be one of the parties; the costs were assessed against him, and the P10 seized were ordered confiscated.<br\/><br\/>The charge which gave rise to the institution of these proceedings consists in that Jose Laserna specially advised and attempted to induce Fausto Briones, the codefendant of Estanislao Carrido, both coperpetrators of the crime of the theft of a cow, delivering to him the sum of P10, to assume the responsibility for the crime by testifying at the hearing of the case in the Court of First Instance of Tayabas that the party named Estanislao, of whom he had made mention in his testimony given in the preliminary investigation, was not Estanislao Carrido, his codefendant, and that he did not know the man Estanislao whom he had previously designated.<br\/><br\/>Laserna being interested in favor of Estanislao Carrido, who was a protege of his, and to secure the acquittal of the latter of the charge of theft pending against him, and also against Fausto Briones, endeavored to have Briones abstain from incriminating Estanislao Carrido in the hearing of the case in the Court of First Instance, although Briones had testified in the preliminary investigation that Carrido did participate in the crime.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding Jose Laserna's proposal, advice, or inducement to Fausto Briones, together with the gift of P10, the latter corroborated his previous testimony wherein he affirmed that the animal that he was accused of stealing was delivered to him by his codefendant Estanislao Carrido. In the course of his testimony, he stated that, despite Laserna's proposal that he should bear false testimony in behalf of Carrido by retracting that which he had previously given in the preliminary investigation, and although he had received the said P10 from Laserna, he had not promised the latter to deny his previous testimony against Carrido, but that, on the contrary, he ratified the same, and he repeated it in the hearing of the case.<br\/><br\/>From all the foregoing facts, it is concluded that, if a proposal or an inducement was made by Laserna to persuade Briones to commit perjury, the former's purpose was not attained, inasmuch as Briones, corroborating his previous testimony, testified in the same manner as formerly, by averring that the stolen animal which he received had come from Estanislao Carrido, whom Laserna endeavored to save from conviction by means of the false testimony which Briones did not give, for the latter did not wish to testify falsely and to commit perjury.<br\/><br\/>The issue raised is as to whether the punishable act of subornation of perjury may be deemed to have been performed, even though the crime of perjury was not committed; that is, as to whether the instigation or persuasion, with which one impels another to commit some crime, is in itself a punishable act entirely apart from the accomplishment of the crime that is the subject of the instigation or inducement.<br\/><br\/>Act No. 1697, section 3, provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any person who, having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the Philippine Islands authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury, and shall be punished by a fine of not more than two thousand pesos and by imprisonment for not more than five years; and shall, moreover, thereafter be incapable of holding any public office or of giving testimony in any court of the Philippine Islands until such time as the judgment against him is reversed.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Section 4 of the same Act prescribes:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any person who causes or procures another person to commit perjury as defined in the preceding section is guilty of subornation of perjury and shall be punished as in said section prescribed.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The defendant in this case availed himself of all the means that were calculated to accomplish his criminal purpose. He endeavored, by the payment of P10, to cause or procure Fausto Briones to retract his previous sworn statements at the preliminary investigation and to give other different testimony, for the purpose of favoring his coaccused, Estanislao Carrido; but, notwithstanding that Briones received the sum delivered to him by the suborner, he did not accommodate Laserna, but ratified his previous testimony and sustained the charge or incrimination that he had previously made against Carrido.<br\/><br\/>So Laserna's criminal purpose to induce Fausto Briones to commit perjury was frustrated, as the latter testified to the truth by sustaining his previous testimony.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with the provisions of the Penal Code, only acts performed which directly tend to the commission of a crime are punishable. The proposal made to a person to commit a criminal act is no more than a criminal proposition to the person who is to carry it out, and, according to the system adopted in the said code, a proposal, as a general rule, is not punishable except in such cases where the law specially penalizes it.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with article 13 of the said code, principals are deemed to be, among others, those who directly force or induce others to commit a crime. The inducement is sometimes made by command or express mandate; at others, by agreement or covenant; and at times by any other act that constitutes a real excitation or instigation efficaciously and purposely made to secure the commission of a crime. The suborner is punishable in the same manner as the person who is induced to actually commit the crime, in case the crime is perpetrated. In the Act aforecited, the person who procures or causes another to commit perjury is punished by the same penalty as that provided for the perjurer.<br\/><br\/>However, if the perjury was not committed, if the party prevailed upon did not venture to commit it, it is in consonance with sound logic to hold that the suborner has not incurred any penalty, for the reason that the mere inducement to commit perjury does not constitute in itself a crime, if the party so persuaded did not carry into execution the criminal act, the sole object of the inducement, inasmuch as, from the terms and sense of the preinserted section 4 of Act No. 1697, it is inferred that it is necessary that, through inducement, the actual commission of the perjury should have been effected, for, according to the English text of the section cited, the words <i>causes or procures<\/i> must be understood to mean that the criminal purpose of the suborner to commit perjury was attained, secured or accomplished by the person so induced having testified falsely, contrary to his oath. Such is the interpretation given to the text of section 4 of Act No. 1121, which contains the same word3, in the case of U. S. vs. Oruga (6 Phil. Rep., 351).<br\/><br\/>It is, then, indispensable for the punishment of the suborner that the person suborned should have testified falsely and committed the crime of perjury, and this was set up as a legal principle in the case of U. S. vs. Ballena (18 Phil. Rep., 382); and in view of the fact that Fausto Briones did not testify falsely and contrary to his previous testimony, notwithstanding the subornation and the efforts exerted by Jose Laserna to cause him to do so, for the purpose of favoring Laserna's protege, Estanislao Carrido, the law affords no means whereby such party, accused of subornation of perjury, may be punished, for, the crime of perjury not having been committed, the subornation can not be understood as consummated and punishable.<br\/><br\/>Such a construction of Act No. 1697 is correct and just and is in harmony with the provisions of the Penal Code, article 4 of which prescribes that \"a conspiracy and proposition to commit a crime are punishable only in the cases in which the law specially makes them so,\" and perjury does not figure among such cases. An inducement to commit a crime is a reprehensible act from the viewpoint of social ethics; it may be a sin, but it does not constitute an act penalized by law if the crime which was the principal and sole object of the inducement was not committed.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, it is proper, in our opinion, with a reversal of the judgment appealed from, to absolve and we hereby absolve Jose Laserna from the charge of subornation of perjury. The costs of both instances shall be <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<\/div>",

This fact effectively  sustains the finding in the judgment appealed from as to the defendant's guilt.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel  for the defense  alleges that  the trial  court obliged the defendant to stand trial without the assistance of an attorney,  and refused to allow his request for time to procure such counsel for his defense; this,  he  alleges, is an error  that affects the  essential rights of  the defendant.<\/p>\n<p>The facts  in no manner support this allegation.  Nowhere in the record does it  appear  that any  postponement was requested by  the defendant for securing counsel. That part of the  record in  which reference  is made to this  point reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The  above-mentioned  case  was called  for hearing on this  date,  September 29,  1910, there being present the defendant, not represented by counsel, and the \"fiscal  representing the United  States.  On the defendant's being asked whether  he could afford to  employ a lawyer, he replied in the affirmative, but said that he had been unable  to come to an agreement with one as to the  amount he should pay  him for  his services.   This  court being of the opinion that the defendant is not entitled to the appointment of  counsel de oficio, and, declining to recognize the fact  of his not having reached an agreement  with his attorney in the matter of his fees  as a proper excuse for postponing the hearing  of this case, orders the  reading of the complaint.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The reason of the court for not postponing the hearing is set forth  in  another part of the  record  and is as  follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The bond given by the defendant in this case was first forfeited; later, the forfeiture was canceled.   Another date was set for the hearing, at least two days in advance. The court sees no  reason whatever for  postponing this case, and still less  for  showing any consideration to  the defendant because he is not represented by counsel, since he does not belong to  the class of  poor  people who  are entitled to the appointment of counsel de oficio.  If he  can not come to an agreement with Mr. Sotto as to the amount of the  latter's fees for defending him, the court is  not called upon  to  take the matter into consideration as a ground for postponement and other similar delays.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>By order of the court the complaint was duly read to the defendant: the latter acknowledged notification thereof and  replied by pleading not  guilty.   Neither on  that occasion, nor before, nor afterwards, nor, in short, at any time during the progress of  the trial, did the defendant request the postponement or suspension of the same or raise any objection or protest  of any sort against the continuance of the trial.  Far from so  doing, the record shows that during the presentation of the evidence he cross-examined the witnesses for the prosecution and afterwards  testified himself as a witness, notwithstanding that he was advised by  the court of his right not to testify unless he  desired to do so of his own free will and consent.<\/p>\n<p>These being the facts, the  assignment of error contained in the brief filed by defendant's counsel is absolutely devoid of foundation.   Accused persons are  undoubtedly entitled to appoint an attorney to defend them at trial, or to have one  appointed de oficio, should they  ask  for one and not possess the necessary means to employ an attorney of their own.  But it devolves exclusively upon them to avail themselves of this right.  It is one which they are perfectly entitled to waive and they may defend themselves in person.   The law expressly authorizes them,  as it  could not but do, to defend themselves in person, without the assistance of counsel.  (Sec. 15, General Orders, No. 58.)   It is understood, of course, that they  waive their right to  be assisted by counsel when they not  only  do not  appoint  or request one, but voluntarily submit to trial, and especially when they  actually exercise therein the right  of  defense by cross-examining the witnesses for  the prosecution and by introducing evidence in their own  behalf,  as was done in the present case.  It is evident that the defendant herein preferred to defend himself personally in the Court of First Instance and, therefore, he can not be heard to complain that he was not  assisted by any attorney in the proceedings there had.  When  an  accused  person in a criminal  case chooses to defend himself in person, none of his rights are infringed by the fact that the  action was prosecuted without the intervention of an attorney  in  his behalf.   In such a case the attendance  of the latter is in no wise necessary for the  legality and perfect propriety of the proceedings.<\/p>\n<p>In consideration of the circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion that a fine  of  P300 is a sufficient  penalty for the crime committed by the accused.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed  from is  therefore modified  in the sense that the  defendant is sentenced only  to pay the fine of P300, or, in case of insolvency, to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment  at  the rate of one day for each P2.50 which  he may  fail to pay, and the costs  in this instance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

They disobeyed this order or citation, and the justice of the peace, after giving them a hearing, found them  guilty of  contempt, and sentenced each to pay a  fine of P3 and to subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency or failure to pay these fines.  The fines not being paid, the justice of  the peace directed  that  the petitioners be confined in the municipal jail for a period of twenty-four hours.  Immediately upon their being placed in confinement, they filed a petition in the Court of First Instance alleging that they were illegally deprived  of their liberty, and requesting  that they  be released on a  writ of habeas corpus.  The writ was duly issued and the case tried by the Court of First Instance  before the expiration of  the twenty-four hours.   Judgment was rendered in these habeas corpus proceedings declaring that the petitioners  were  illegally confined and ordering their release forthwith. The lower court was of the opinion  that under the provisions of section 65 of Act No. 190 as amended by section 12 of Act No. 1627, a justice of the peace has no authority or power to thus impose upon a  person  a  fine  or imprisonment  for disobeying a subpoena issued by him.<\/p>\n<p>The office of justice of the peace is  one both ancient and honorable, and came to America  from the common law.  The duties imposed upon this officer by the common law and  by statute  were of a varied and  complex nature.  While   in America the name  and the office have been retained,  his duties  are  by no means as numerous  as they were   in England.  In America his jurisdiction is fixed by the constitution and the statutes of his state.  He is there recognized as an officer clothed with limited judicial powers, and such powers cannot be extended by construction.  His functions and duties being defined and limited by the constitution and statutes, the powers thereby conferred must be strictly construed.   These same rules are applicable in the Philippine Islands, as the powers and duties of a justice of the peace in this country are defined by statute.   These statutes clothe that officer with judicial powers, but such powers are limited.  In the Organic Act, No. 136, his jurisdiction was fixed.   His civil jurisdiction  as fixed by section 68 of said Act has been extended  by subsequent legislation, until he now has jurisdiction to adjudicate title to  real estate where the value of the property does not exceed a certain amount, and also to issue, under certain circumstances,  preliminary injunctions (Act No. 2041).  His criminal jurisdiction remains about the same.   By thus extending his jurisdiction, the justice of the peace has  become an important judicial officer.  Yet, the power to fine or imprison for contempt for willfully disobeying a subpoena is not inherent in the court of a justice of the peace.  If this court has such power,  it must be conferred upon it by a statute.   The first inquiry is whether the justice of the peace had the  power, under the statutes, to adjudge the contempt, and make the order of commitment.  It will be remembered that they  had the power to issue the subpoenas  and that the petitioners willfully  disobeyed this process with which they were served. The justice of the peace was a judicial officer, acting in the discharge of  his official duties, and, as such, a contempt of his authority or orders, within the scope of his powers, was punishable.  It was the duty  of the petitioners  to obey the mandate which they received. In refusing this obedience, they defied the law and were  in contempt  of its authority. They could not  determine  for themselves  whether or not they should appear as directed, and thus set at defiance the proceedings and orders of the justice of the peace.  Now, what  were the powers of the justice  of the peace in the premises?<\/p>\n<p>In the Organic Act (No.  136)  nothing whatever is said in reference to the power of a  justice of the peace to. punish for contempt.  We will examine the various provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (Act No. 190) for the purpose of ascertaining what powers in reference to contempt have been  conferred  upon  justices, of the peace.  \"Incidental powers of courts: Every court shall have power (and this includes courts  of justices of the peace) to preserve and enforce order in its immediate presence;  *  *   *  to compel obedience to its judgments, orders, and process.\"   (Sec. 11.)  Process, as here used, include subpoenas.  Chapter 15 provides the manner of summoning a' defendant in a civil action.  This part of that chapter applies to the justice of the peace courts.  (Sec. 51.)   After the commencement of an  action, a justice  of the peace may issue a subpoena directed to any witness whose testimony may be desired, requiring his attendance at a time and place specified therein. (Sec. 68.)   He  is also authorized to take depositions (sec. 361), and for this purpose may issue subpoenas and compel the attendance of witnesses (sees. 403 and 410).<\/p>\n<p>Contempt:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A justice of the peace may summarily impose a fine  not exceeding ten pesos, or sentence to imprisonment  for a period  not  exceeding  one day,  or  impose both  of such punishments; upon a person guilty of misbehavior in  the presence of or so near the justice of the peace as to obstruct him in the performance of his judicial duties.\"   (Sec. 65.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Sections 231 to 240, inclusive, deal with the power of Courts of First  Instance and judges of such courts in reference to contempts.  These  provisions do  not apply to courts of justices of  the peace.  Under section 65 (supra), a justice of the peace was given power to summarily fine or imprison (and this means  without a hearing)  any person guilty of misbehavior in his  presence or so  near  as to obstruct him in the performance  of his  judicial  duties. The power herein conferred was confined strictly to disturbances or misconduct in or near  the place where the justice of the peace was performing his duties as such, and did not extend to the acts or conduct of parties not in the presence of or near the justice of the peace.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If the  witness fails to appear  at  the  time and  place specified in the subpoena, the justice may issue a warrant upon which he may be seized and brought before the justice and compelled to testify, and the  costs of such  warrant and seizure  of  the witness shall be paid  by the witness if the justice shall determine that his failure to answer the subpoena was willful or without just excuse.\"   (Sec. 68.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Contempt  in the presence of or so near the justice of the peace as to obstruct him in the performance of his judicial duties and the compelling of witnesses to attend and testify are herein  treated as two subjects and by different sections. The willful disobedience on the part  of a witness of a lawful subpoena isued by a  justice of the  peace is a contempt of this officer's authority and of the law.   The punishment for this contempt is fixed in section 68 by charging him with the costs of his  arrest; but before he can be thus punished he is entitled to a hearing,  but not to an  appeal.  The provisions  of section 68 are only applicable in cases wherein there is an action either civil or criminal  pending before the justice, and  do not apply when this judicial officer is performing other judicial  duties.  When he is performing other judicial duties,  such as  taking depositions or testimony, his  power to arrest and compel attendance of witnesses is found in section 410, which  power is the same as that conferred by section 68.  Section 408 confers the power upon justices of the peace to punish as a contempt a  witness  who disobeys a subpoena, refuses to  be  sworn, to answer questions,  or to subscribe  to an  affidavit  or deposition.  This applies when the justice is performing the duty of  taking testimony or depositions and not  to the trial of cases.  The power conferred upon  justices  of the peace  by said section 408 is  limited by the provisions of the last  part of the last paragraph of section 403.  That is, such power must  be exercised in the same  manner  as if the witness had been directed to appear before the justice in  an action pending in his court.  The result so far is that the justice of  the  peace was  empowered by  these provisions to carry  on his  judicial  duties in an  orderly manner, to punish by fine, or imprisonment any person who misbehaved in or near his presence  so as to obstruct the performance of such judicial duties,  to compel the attendance of witnesses, and to punish them for the willful disobedience  of his  subpoenas by charging them  with  the costs of their arrest.  As to whether or not a justice of the peace could fine or commit under the power conferred upon him by section  65, a person  who willfully refused to testify, to answer questions, or to obey the lawful verbal orders given by the justice himself, is not specifically stated in terms.  Again, it  was thought that a  person adjudged guilty of contempt by a justice of the peace and punished as provided in section 65 should be entitled to an appeal, as such punishment could be imposed summarily without a hearing.  Therefore,  section 65 was amended by section 12 of Act No. 1627 so as to read as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A justice of the  peace may summarily impose a fine of not more than ten pesos or a term of imprisonment not exceeding one day, or both, upon any one guilty of misconduct in the presence of the justice or  so near as to interrupt the proceedings of his court or in open defiance of his authority;  but the party adjudged in  contempt may appeal from such sentence  and the same shall be stayed as in ordinary criminal cases.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the section as thus amended,  the words \"misconduct\" and \"interrupt the proceedings of his court\" have been substituted in lieu of \"misbehavior\" and \"obstruct him in the performance of his judicial duties.\"  There has also  been added the phrase \"or in open defiance of his authority,\" and the right to appeal.  The mere substitution of the word \"misconduct\" for \"misbehavior\" cannot operate to  change in effect the former  section. The phrase \"interrupt the proceedings of his court\" as used  in  the  amended  section must  be given the same meaning  as  the phrase \"obstruct him in the performance of his judicial duties;\" otherwise, we might have a justice of the peace with full power while actually engaged in the performance of his judicial duties as judge of his court to punish for misconduct committed in or near his court, and without that power when he was performing other duties, such as the taking of depositions. Sections 68 and 410 remain unchanged.<\/p>\n<p>In  respect to Courts of First Instance and the judges thereof, the Code of Civil Procedure recognizes two kinds or classes of contempt, viz, direct and constructive.  The first is treated of in section 231, and the second in section 232 et seq.  Where the contempt is direct\u2014that is, in the presence of or so near the court  or judge as to obstruct  the administration of justice\u2014summary punishment may be inflicted, without a complaint or order ta show cause or other process.   Formal entry showing the judgment constitutes the full record.  From  such a judgment no appeal will lie. In the proceedings to punish for constructive contempts\u2014that is, contempts committed. out  of the presence of  the court\u2014a charge in writing must be filed with the clerk and an opportunity given the accused to be heard.   (Sec.  233.) From a  judgment thus entered,  the  convicted person is entitled to appeal to the Supreme  Court.  If the witness, after having been duly cited, willfully disobeys a subpoena issued out of the Court  of First Instance, such witness may be arrested and brought before the court, and if he fails to give a satisfactory  excuse  for  his conduct, he may be taxed with the costs of such arrest, but this does not take away the power of the  court to punish him for constructive contempt.  Section 65  only confers upon justices of  the peace power to punish for direct  contempts, that is, misbehavior committed in the presence of or so near the justice of the peace as to obstruct him in the performance of his judicial duties.  This same power is retained in the section as amended.   Under either form of the section, the justice could summarily impose  the  penalty,  that is,  without a hearing.   The adding of the clause \"or in open defiance of his authority\"  in the section  as amended can not be construed  to  include  constructive contempts for the reason that for a violation of this provision the  punishment may be summarily imposed, whereas, if said provision included constructive contempts, the person accused  of  violating the same would necessarily be entitled to  a ,hearing before conviction.  But we can not say that this provision was added without a purpose.  The purpose  was to complete the power of the justice of the peace to punish for all cases of direct contempts such as the refusal of a witness to be sworn,  to answer questions, etc.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

In support of his allegations, the defendant administrator introduced in\u00a0 evidence an\u00a0 admittedly\u00a0 genuine document which purports to be a deed of sale of\u00a0 a tract of\u00a0 land including the parcel of land described in the complaint, from Juan Manzano to Nicolas Jalandoni, dated April 30, 1872.<\/p><p>In support of their respective claims\u00a0 of ownership in the land in question, both the plaintiff and the intervener rely, substantially upon their contention that the evidence of record\u00a0 sustains a\u00a0 finding that both\u00a0 Juan Manzano and Nicolas Jalandoni were tenants of their common predecessors\u00a0 in interest to whom they paid rent for\u00a0 the\u00a0 land in dispute in this action.\u00a0\u00a0 Of course if the evidence sustains a\u00a0 finding that Nicolas Jalandoni, deceased, took possession of, and held, the land merely as the tenant of the predecessors\u00a0 in\u00a0 interest of the t plaintiff\u00a0 and the intervener,\u00a0 the defendant,\u00a0 wl)o\u00a0 claims\u00a0 possession merely as Jalandoni's administrator,\u00a0 would\u00a0 be estopped from\u00a0 denying\u00a0 title\u00a0 in the landlord, and judgment against him for the possession of the land would, necessarily follow in favor of either the plaintiff\u00a0 or the intervener or both.\u00a0 We are of opinion, however, that the evidence does not sustain such a\u00a0 finding, and that the judgment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 lower court against the defendant\u00a0 must therefore be reversed.<\/p><p>The evidence on which counsel\u00a0 for the plaintiff and the intervener rely\u00a0 in\u00a0 support of the alleged relationship of landlord\u00a0 and tenant consists, first, of vague, indefinite and uncertain oral testimony of several witnesses touching certain alleged\u00a0 payments of a\u00a0 small annual rental by Juan Manzano and Nicolas Jalandoni, deceased, and,\u00a0 second, an alleged admission of the relationship of landlord and tenant by Juan\u00a0 Manzano, said to be set forth in the deed of sale from\u00a0 him to Nicolas Jalandoni.<\/p><p>In our opinion the\u00a0 oral testimony fails utterly to establish affirmatively the fact that Nicolas Jalandoni made, at any time, any payments whatever of rent for or on account of the land in question.\u00a0 There is no evidence which even tends to\u00a0 maintain a finding that any such payments were\u00a0 made since 1882, and we think that the testimony as to some alleged payments made on account of this land prior to that date, is too uncertain and vague to sustain an affirmative finding that Jalandoni made any such payments.\u00a0 This testimony undoubtedly tends to establish the fact that some payments were made many years ago\u00a0 on account of this land, but the most that can be said affirmatively as to the exact date when these payments were made\u00a0 is that it appears from the testimony that some such\u00a0 payments were made by Juan Manzano prior to April 30,\u00a0 1872, the date when he executed the deed of sale to Nicolas Jalandoni.<\/p><p>The alleged admissions contained in the deed of April 30. 1872, are found in the following excerpt therefrom.\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"It must\u00a0 be noted that the heirs of the native Esteban Gregorio\u00a0 (<em>alias <\/em>Goyong),\u00a0 have\u00a0 informed Messrs.\u00a0 Looney &amp; Co.\u00a0 that although the titles which they, the heirs, have to the land\u00a0 on which is erected the building belonging to their predecessor in interest do not prove such ownership, yet from pure benevolence and as a philanthropic act they have paid the latter an annual rental of twenty pesos; furthermore the undersigned in his own behalf declares that for his part the payment of said rental ceases and thus the building, as well as the land sold, is free from any gravamen, either\u00a0 intrinsic or extrinsic*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 questions,\u00a0 usages, customs, rights, and incumbrances, without reservation, and free from all <em>gravamen<\/em>, though subject to the statement regarding the alleged rental above mentioned\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>But\u00a0 these statements of the vendor amount at most to an admission that he had, at some time prior to the sale, paid a small annual rental for the land in question. And they clearly establish the fact that\u00a0 at that date the\u00a0 vendor asserted a claim of absolute ownership in the land;\u00a0 denied that such payments as he had made on account of the land were made under any rental contract, claiming that they were made rather for the sake of peace and to avoid litigation ; and that in selling the land to Nicolas Jalandoni he undertook to convey the title thereto, free and unencumbered.<\/p><p>We think it is very clear\u00a0 that these statements in the document, so far as\u00a0 they have any probative value, while they appear to corroborate the claims and the testimony of the plaintiff and intervener that Manzano at one time paid rent for\u00a0 the land in question, at the\u00a0 same\u00a0 time tend to sustain the contention\u00a0 of\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 that, whatever Manzano\u00a0 may have done prior to the date of\u00a0 the execution of the deed of sale,\u00a0 Jalandoni\u00a0 and the Jalandoni estate have been in continuous possession of the land in question since April 30, 1872\u00a0 (more than thirty years prior to the institution of this action),\u00a0 occupying1 it\u00a0 under a claim of ownership based on the deed of sale from\u00a0 Manzano, who, himself, claimed\u00a0 the\u00a0 absolute title to the land at the time when he\u00a0 executed the deed.<\/p><p>But whatever the truth may be as to the alleged payments by Jalandoni, we are\u00a0 of opinion, and so hold; first, that the evidence of record does\u00a0 not sustain an affirmative finding that any such payments were made by Jalandoni, as alleged by the plaintiff and\u00a0 the intervener; and second, that\u00a0 the evidence does not sustain an affirmative finding negativing the allegations of the defendant that throughout the entire period of\u00a0 more than\u00a0 thirty\u00a0 years during which Jalandoni, deceased,\u00a0 and his estate, have been in possession of the land in\u00a0 question,\u00a0 it has been\u00a0 held under a\u00a0 claim of absolute ownership.<\/p><p>This being an\u00a0 action of ejectment the burden of proof is, of\u00a0 course, upon those seeking to dispossess the actual occupant,\u00a0 and their failure to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence,\u00a0 their contention that\u00a0 the\u00a0 occupancy\u00a0 for more than thirty\u00a0 years or any part thereof by Jalandoni and his estate has been under and\u00a0 by virtue of a rental contract, and not as claimed by the defendant under a claim of ownership, makes it clear that judgment should not have been rendered against the defendant in\u00a0 favor of either\u00a0 the plaintiff or the intervener.<\/p><p>The trial judge appears to have been of opinion that the judgment\u00a0 to be rendered in this case is controlled by our decision in the case of Jalandoni <em>vs<\/em>. Lizarraga Hermanos\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6 Phil. Rep., 471), wherein the meaning and proper construction of the abovecited deed of sale of April 30,\u00a0 1872, were drawn in question.<\/p><p>In that case the plaintiff,\u00a0 who is\u00a0 the defendant in this action sought to recover possession from the defendant, who is the intervener in this action, of a\u00a0 certain parcel of land which was included within the tract described in\u00a0 the deed of sale.\u00a0\u00a0 But the parcel of land in question in this action is wholly different from that in the former action, and the only material fact found in the former action which was put at issue\u00a0 in this action and could in any event be held to be conclusive\u00a0 as\u00a0 between these\u00a0 parties is\u00a0 the fact that the citation in the deed set out above discloses that Manzano, prior to the date of the execution of the deed of April 30, 1872, paid rent for the land in question.\u00a0\u00a0 As we have shown, however, proof of that fact alone is not sufficient to sustain a\u00a0 finding that Jalandoni ever made such payments; and in the absence of proof to the contrary, this excerpt from the old deed tends also to sustain the contentions of the defendant that for the last 38 years Jalandoni and the Jalandoni estate have been\u00a0 holding the land in question in this action under a\u00a0 claim of absolute ownership.<\/p><p>The parcels of land in question in\u00a0 these two actions are different sections of the larger tract\u00a0 described in the deed of April 30, 1872.\u00a0 The evidence introduced at the trial of both\u00a0 actions was very similar in character, as are\u00a0 the contentions\u00a0 of the parties in support of their respective claims. there is\u00a0 however this vital difference between the two cases. The defendant in this action was the plaintiff in the former action, and whereas in\u00a0 this action he is in\u00a0 possession, and his possession and\u00a0 that\u00a0 of Nicolas\u00a0 Jalandoni appear to have extended over a period of considerably more than thirty years; in the former action, as appears from the\u00a0 decision above referred to, it did not appear that he had ever\u00a0 been in possession, his claim being based strictly and exclusively on the terms of his deed from Manzano.\u00a0\u00a0 As a result, in the former case the burden was upon him to establish\u00a0 his title and that of Manzano by a preponderance of the evidence, while in this\u00a0 case the burden oi;\u00a0 proof of their title rests upon his opponents.\u00a0 As appears\u00a0 from our remarks in the decision in the former case, the evidence adduced at the trial was not very satisfactory, and judgment for possession was denied for lack of satisfactory proof by the claimant; and as we have shown, the evidence in this case is so vague, uncertain and indefinite, that we cannot say that the claimants have satisfactorily established their contentions, and judgment for possession in their favor\u00a0 cannot, therefore, be sustained.\u00a0 In an action to recover possession of real estate the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to\u00a0 show that\u00a0 he has a better right to the possession than the defendant; and the universal\u00a0 rule in actions of ejectment, where plaintiff seeks to recover possession, and establish title to the land in controversy, is that he must rely on the strength of his own and not upon the weakness of defendant's title.<\/p><p>Actual\u00a0 possession\u00a0 of\u00a0 real\u00a0 estate for more\u00a0 than\u00a0 thirty years, under a bona fide claim of ownership, establishes a perfect title, and such a title should not be permitted to be put\u00a0 in doubt by\u00a0 an allegation\u00a0 that the possession was not held under a claim of ownership, supported merely\u00a0 by the\u00a0 introduction\u00a0 of vague,\u00a0 indefinite\u00a0 and uncertain oral testimony as to payments of small sums alleged to have been payments\u00a0 of rent many years prior to the institution of\u00a0 an action to\u00a0 recover possession.\u00a0 Testimony as to such payments is of course competent and relevant, but in the absence of satisfactory corroborative evidence and of a satisfactory explanation of the long delay in instituting proceedings for the recovery of possession after the alleged payments have ceased, vague, indefinite and uncertain oral testimony\u00a0 of this kind\u00a0 should\u00a0 be and will be\u00a0 received doubtingly, and scrutinized with\u00a0 care, and\u00a0 will rarely be' held to be sufficient to maintain an affirmative finding as to\u00a0 the relation of landlord and tenant on which a\u00a0 judgment in favor of the plaintiff in an action of ejectment\u00a0 may securely rest.<\/p><p>The judgment of the court below in favor of the plaintiff and intervener should be and is hereby reversed without costs in this\u00a0 instance,\u00a0 and the complaint of the\u00a0 original plaintiff and the amended complaint of the intervener should be and are dismissed without delay.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

That the attachment of the chattels above1 mentioned by  the defendant Antonino Babasa, and the deprivation of  their use by  the firm of Arguelles and Syyap, from the date the attachment was served, has caused the plaintiff, as a member of the  said partnership, losses and damages to the amount of P50,000 Philippine currency.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>And the petition in the complaint is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Therefore, the plaintiff prays the court to render  judgment  by  finding  that  the defendant  Silvino Lim  only acquired, by virtue of the sale of the said personal  property effected by the defendant Antonino  Babasa,  as sheriff  of the Province  of Batangas, the  right or share therein which belonged to the defendant  Pedro Syyap, and that the plaintiff is now the owner of an undivided part of the aforesaid personal property equivalent  to the share he had  as a capitalist partner in the firm of Arguelles and Syyap; that it determine  the  present  value of the said  property, and sentence the  defendant  Silvino Lim to pay to the plaintiff the proportionate part of such value as corresponds to him, or, in case the said Lim should be unwilling to make such payment, that the  court order the  sale of the aforementioned personal property and the distribution of the proceeds thereof proportionally between the plaintiff and the defendant Silvino Lim; that it furthermore  sentence, severally, the defendant Silvino Lim and the defendant Antonino  Babasa  to pay P50,000  Philippine currency to the plaintiff for losses and damages caused him  by the illegal attachment of the said  personal property in the manner described in  this complaint, with the costs.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The defendant Antonino  Babasa answered  the complaint by denying some of the facts alleged therein, alleging others as a special defense  and praying that he be absolved from the said complaint, with the costs of the trial against the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>The other two defendants, Silvino Lim and Pedro Syyap, filed a demurrer to the complaint, on the following grounds: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A. That the plaintiff lacks  the legal personality requisite for the prosecution of this action.<\/p>\n<p>\"B. That there is  a  confusion of  parties  defendant in the complaint.<\/p>\n<p>\"C. That the complaint is ambiguous and  therefore unintelligible.<\/p>\n<p>\"D. That the court lacks jurisdiction to try this case.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>By  order of February 1, 1911, the court  sustained the demurrer upon  the  first of the grounds alleged therein, declaring the  others  to be  unfounded; and,  by virtue  of such ruling, allowed the plaintiff a period of fifteen days in which to amend his complaint.  The plaintiff  duly excepted to this  order  and, by a  written petition  of  February 11, stated to the court that  in his opinion the complaint was not susceptible of amendment and requested  that the case be finally decided on  its  merits.  The court,  therefore, on January 6, finally dismissed the case, with the costs against the plaintiff,  which  judgment  was duly  and opportunely excepted to by the latter.<\/p>\n<p>The legal grounds of the order sustaining the demurrer, are summarized in the following excerpt therefrom, which, copied literally, reads thus :<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In accordance with  these allegations, there existed a partnership  of a purely civil character, formed  by two capitalist partners only, who were the plaintiff, Jose Arguelles, and the defendant Pedro Syyap, and the purpose of which was the repair or construction of the highway from Batangas to  San Jose in this province.  The said partnership acquired and legitimately became the owner of certain personal property which afterwards the  defendant, Antonino Babasa, as sheriff of the Province of Batangas and in compliance with a writ of execution issued by the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, against the defendant Pedro Syyap and on the asseveration of the other defendant, Silvino Lim,  the judgment creditor, that this property belonged to the said judgment  debtor, attached the same and sold it at public auction, adjudicating it to the judgment creditor, the said partnership being thus deprived  of the use thereof, on which account it is alleged that damages and losses were occasioned in the amount demanded in the complaint.  If the said partnership, whose existence must be presumed as continuing, because there is no allegation in the complaint to the contrary, was that which was dispossessed of the personal property in question, obviously it is the partnership itself,  and not any of  its members in his character as such, which  should demand the same and the recovery of possession  thereof, because the partnership is a  juridical entity completely distinct from the personality of the members constituting it.  Therefore, the plaintiff who demands the said property,  not as the representative of the said partnership, but in his character of a member  thereof, has no legal personality  whereupon to sustain his claim.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>We  do not believe this  conclusion of  the judgment appealed from to be well founded.  The question of the personality of a  plaintiff refers, and  can only refer, to the qualifications necessary in order  that he may appear in a trial, or to the character or representation under which the suit is brought.  It is not necessary to treat of this  last point in the present case, inasmuch as the plaintiff does not file the complaint in representation of another person, but in his own name.  It  is true that in the body of the complaint the plaintiff speaks of the partnership formed between himself and the defendant Pedro Syyap, of the acquisition by the said partnership, and with its own funds, of the property which afterwards was attached and sold by the sheriff of the Province of Batangas as exclusively  belonging to the said Syyap, and of  the fact of the aforementioned partnership being deprived of the use of the property in question, in consequence of that sale; but said plaintiff does not  in fact exercise any action in the name of the partnership before mentioned, nor does he ask for anything in its behalf.  The partnership is not the plaintiff,  nor does it appear as such in this suit; its  name  does  not figure in  the title  of  the case, neither does the complaint contain any petition whatsoever in favor or benefit of such partnership.   All that the plaintiff asks, he asks for himself; he brings an action of his  own and demands a right which he considers to be a personal right of his own and the payment of sums which in his opinion were  owing to him personally, also.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That the court find that the  <em>plaintiff <\/em>is now the owner of an  undivided part of the property mentioned  in  the complaint  *   *  *;   that it sentence the defendant, Silvino Lim, to pay to the <em>plaintiff <\/em>the proportional part <em>corresponding to him<\/em> of the value of said property  *  *  *; that it further sentence,  jointly,  the defendant,  Silvino Lim, and  the defendant Antonino Babasa  to  the payment of P50,000, Philippine  currency, for  losses and damages caused to  the <em>plaintiff<\/em>   *  *  *.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Such are the fundamental petitions made  in the complaint and all of them, as  is  seen, in the plaintiff's own name and for the plaintiff himself.   Accordingly, the plaintiff brought the action  in the exercise of the direct and personal right he had to appear  in  a  trial, and, therefore, the  whole question, in deciding whether he had or had not the requisite personality to bring such an action, is reduced to determining whether he was or was not in the full possession of his civil rights, which is the only condition required to enable a party to prosecute an action  or a personal  right as  a plaintiff with full and perfect personality.  And there is no allegation in the complaint from which it may be concluded, either directly or indirectly, that the plaintiff was not in the enjoyment of the  full possession of  his civil rights; consequently,  the  demurrer founded  on the alleged  lack  of personality on  the part of the plaintiff should have been overruled.<\/p>\n<p>That, as held in the judgment of the trial court,  the dispossession alleged in the complaint may have been committed against the partnership formed between the plaintiff and Pedro Syyap,  and that this same partnership, and  not the plaintiff  as a  member thereof, is  the one  entitled to demand the property of which it was  dispossessed, or its equivalent value, as Well as an indemnity for the losses and damages caused by such dispossession,  does  not affect  the personality of the plaintiff, but,his right to ask for what he claims in the complaint.   He may not have such a right, he may lack the right of action under the complaint; but the lack of a  right of action is one  thing, and the  lack  of personality is another thing entirely different: they are two juridical conceptions  which must not be confounded, and they produce different  effects in law.  Personality affects the form; and the right of action, the substance.  Lack of personality cannot be predicated  upon the lack  of right of action.<\/p>\n<p>With a reversal of the order appealed from, the demurrer interposed by the defendants Silvino Lim and Pedro Syyap is overruled and they are granted a  period of ten days in which to answer the complaint.  No express finding is made of the costs in this instance.  So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,  Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

I., in violation of law.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> Immediately after the prosecuting attorney had\u00a0 closed the presentation of his proof, the attorney for the defendants Timoteo\u00a0 Romero and Esteban Caramat, presented a motion\u00a0 in the lower\u00a0 court asking that the cause of action against them be dismissed and that they be discharged from the custody of the law,\u00a0 for the reason that the proof presented by the prosecuting attorney was insufficient to show that they were guilty of the crime\u00a0 charged.\u00a0\u00a0 (See\u00a0 record. page 81.)<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 After a consideration\u00a0 of this motion by the Honorable George N. Hurd, the same was granted with\u00a0 reference to the defendant Esteban Caramat and denied as to the defendant Timoteo Romero.\u00a0 The lower court found that the evidence was insufficient to support the charges against the defendant Esteban\u00a0 Caramat\u00a0 and dismissed 'the\u00a0 complaint against him and discharged him\u00a0 from the custody of the law.\u00a0\u00a0 The trial\u00a0 of\u00a0 the cause then proceeded against the other defendants.<\/p><p> At the close of the trial the Honorable George N. Hurd, judge, found that the evidence showed, beyond\u00a0 a reasonable doubt, that the defendants, Timoteo Romero, Anastacio Balut, and Mariano Antonio, were guilty of the crime charged in the complaint and sentenced them to be imprisoned for a period\u00a0 of six years ten months and one day of <em>presidio mayor,<\/em> and\u00a0 to jointly and\u00a0 severally indemnify\u00a0 the\u00a0 said Braulio\u00a0 Carbonel in the sum of P50 and to pay the costs.<\/p><p> The lower, court found that there existed in\u00a0 the commission\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime\u00a0 the aggravating\u00a0 circumstance\u00a0 of\u00a0 nocturnity.\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p> From that sentence the defendant Timoteo\u00a0 Romero appealed and made several assignments\u00a0 of error, in this court, as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><p> \"1. In overruling the motion for dismissal with respect to the defendant Timoteo Romero for lack of\u00a0 evidence.\u00a0 <\/p><p> \"2. In finding the appellant guilty of the crime of <em>robo en cuudrilla<\/em> as a principal and direct\u00a0 participant.\u00a0 <\/p><p> \"3. In finding that the crime charged was committed with the circumstances qualifying criminal responsibility of <em>cuadrilla<\/em> and nocturnity, with sentence to the penalty of six years ten months and one\u00a0 day of <em>arresto mayor<\/em>, and the accessories specified in the judgment appealed from.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> With reference to the\u00a0 first\u00a0 assignment of error, to wit, that the lower court committed an error in refusing to dismiss the complaint against the defendant at the close of the testimony of the prosecution, it may be said that it was not an error for the lower court to refuse to deny said motion. The\u00a0 lower court evidently believed and was convinced, at the time of the presentation of said motion, that a prima facie case\u00a0 had been presented, sufficient at least to show that the defendant and appellant was guilty of the crime charged.\u00a0\u00a0 The lower court, in view of the evidence admitted, had a right\u00a0 to deny\u00a0 said motion.\u00a0\u00a0 In the\u00a0 case\u00a0 of United States <em>vs<\/em>. Abaroa (3\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 116), this court expressed its disapproval of the practice of dismissing a criminal case on motion\u00a0 of the attorney for\u00a0 the accused,\u00a0 when the fiscal announced that he had no more testimony'to offer.\u00a0 The court said\u00a0 that this practice should not be allowed, for the following reasons:<\/p><p> (1)\u00a0 If this court should not agree with the conclusion reached by the court below, it would be authorized to reverse the judgment\u00a0 (sentence) and\u00a0 enter judgment\u00a0 (sentence) convicting\u00a0 the accused upon the facts proved by the prosecution,\u00a0 thus\u00a0 depriving the accused of making\u00a0 a\u00a0 defense below, if he\u00a0 had\u00a0 a defense; and<\/p><p> (2)\u00a0 If this court, on disapproval of the judgment of the court below,\u00a0 should order a new trial, the result would be that the prosecution would be obliged to place the defendant on trial twice, when\u00a0 all the evidence could have been obtained in one trial, and the defendant would have the benefit of delay and the possible death or disappearance\u00a0 of\u00a0 witnesses for\u00a0 the prosecution.<\/p><p> The court\u00a0 announced the doctrine, in that case that the better practice is to\u00a0 require\u00a0 the defendant to\u00a0 make\u00a0 his defense, if he desires to offer\u00a0 evidence in his own behalf, and not to dismiss the case on motion, until both\u00a0 parties have presented their\u00a0 evidence.<\/p><p> It will be remembered, however, at the time of the decision of U. S.<em> vs<\/em>. Abaroa {<em>supra<\/em>)\u00a0\u00a0 (December\u00a0 29, 1903), that the prosecuting attorney, in case he did not agree with the conclusions of the lower court,\u00a0 had a right to appeal to the Supreme Court from\u00a0 the decision of the lower court. It having\u00a0 been decided in\u00a0 the case\u00a0 of U.S.\u00a0 <em>vs.<\/em> Kepner (1 Phil. Rep., 397; 195 U. S., 100; 11 Phil. Rep., 669), that the prosecuting attorney can not appeal from a decision of the lower court when that decision is based upon the merits of the case, there seems now\u00a0 to be no reason for putting the defendant to the necessity of presenting his proof, if, at the time of the\u00a0 close of the proof of the prosecution, there is not sufficient evidence to convince the lower court that the defendant is guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the crime charged in the complaint\u00a0 Whether or not the evidence presented by the prosecuting attorney, at the time he rests his cause, is Sufficient to convince the court that the defendant is guilty, beyond a reasonable\u00a0 doubt, of the crime\u00a0 charged, rests entirely\u00a0 within\u00a0 the\u00a0 sound discretion and judgment of the lower court.\u00a0 Whether he committed an error in denying the motion to dismiss, for insufficiency of proof, can only be determined upon appeal, and then not because\u00a0 he committed\u00a0 an error, as such, but because the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause\u00a0 was not sufficient to\u00a0 show that the defendant was guilty\u00a0 of the crimd charged.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 Notwithstanding the decision of this court in the case of U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Abaroa (<em>supra<\/em>), we see no reason now, after the doctrine announced in the Kepner case, for denying the right of the lower court to dismiss a case at the close of the presentation of the testimony by the\u00a0 prosecuting attorney, if at that time there is not sufficient\u00a0 evidence to make out a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prima\u00a0 facie<\/span> case against the defendant\u00a0\u00a0 If,\u00a0 however, the lower court, at that time, in the course of the trial, refuses to dismiss the defendant,\u00a0 his\u00a0 dismissal can not be made the basis of an appeal for the purpose of reversing the\u00a0 sentence of\u00a0 the lower court<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 With reference to the second\u00a0 assignment of error, to wit: That the lower court committed\u00a0 an\u00a0 error in finding the defendant guilty of the crime of <em>robo en cuadrilla<\/em>, it\u00a0 will be noted\u00a0 that two of the original defendants, Apolonio de\u00a0 la Cruz and Felix Camacho, testified as witnesses\u00a0 for the prosecution.\u00a0 They each testified that on\u00a0 or about the 28th of December, 1910, in the nighttime, eight or ten persons, each. of them with a <em>carreton<\/em>, armed with bolos, went to the field of Braulio Oarbonel, where the latter had a quantity of rice under the charge and care of\u00a0 one Prudencio\u00a0 Carpio,\u00a0 and after manacling the latter and blindfolding him, took\u00a0 and carried away a quantity of said rice, and later on, the same night, deposited the same in the granary of Timoteo Romero.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>It will be noted also that during the trial of\u00a0 the cause, Timoteo Romero testified in his own behalf.\u00a0 He admitted the rice found in his granary soon after the 28th\u00a0 of December, 1910, was the rice of Braulio Carbonel.\u00a0 He testified, however, that at about midnight on a certain night in\u00a0 December, 1910, his cousin, Anastacio\u00a0 Balut, brought the rice to his house while he was sleeping and awoke him and asked permission to place the rice in his\u00a0 granary.\u00a0 This fact is denied in part by Anastacio Balut.\u00a0 Anastacio Balut admits that he brought a part of the rice to the house of Timoteo Romero at about midnight of one of the nights of December,\u00a0 1910.\u00a0 He testified, however,\u00a0 that the rice did not be- long to him,\u00a0 but belonged to one\u00a0 of the other defendants. He, Anastacio Balut, admits that he, together with eight or ten other persons, with <em>carretones<\/em>, armed with bolos, went to a certain place at nighttime and secured a quantity of rice, and\u00a0 took the\u00a0 same to the house\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant, Timoteo Romero.\u00a0\u00a0 It will\u00a0 also be remembered that Anastacio Balut is one of the defendants; that he was\u00a0 sentenced by the lower court to\u00a0 be\u00a0 imprisoned\u00a0 for a period of\u00a0 six years ten months\u00a0 and one\u00a0 day of <em>presidio mayor<\/em> and that he did\u00a0 not appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 We have then the positive declaration of two witnesses who had\u00a0 been originally charged, jointly with the present defendants, that in the nighttime\u00a0 on or about the 28th of December, 1910, they, together with Timoteo Romero and seven or eight other persons, went to the fields of Braulio Carbonel,\u00a0 and\u00a0 there by force and violence, being armed with bolos, took and carried away a quantity of rice and deposited the same in\u00a0 the granary of the said Timoteo Romero.<\/p><p> For the\u00a0 defense another\u00a0 one of the defendants admitted that he, together with seven or eight others, armed\u00a0 with bolos, went to a certain place, with carretones, and obtained a quantity\u00a0 of rice and deposited the same in the granary of Timoteo Romero.\u00a0 Timoteo Romero testified that the latter\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 witness, Anastacio Balut, was his cousin, and that he, Anastacio\u00a0 Balut, brought a quantity of\u00a0 rice to his house and asked permission to deposit the same in his granary, which permission was granted.\u00a0 It thus appears that the declaration of Timoteo Romero, to the effect that his cousin, Anastacio Balut, brought the rice in question\u00a0 to his house and secured permission to deposit the\u00a0 same in his granary, is absolutely false.\u00a0\u00a0 Anastacio Balut swore positively that the rice did\u00a0 not belong to him and denied\u00a0 also\u00a0 that\u00a0 he had obtained permission from Timoteo Romero to deposit\u00a0 the same\u00a0 in\u00a0 the latter's granary.<\/p><p> In view of these contradictory statements of Timoteo Romero and Anastacio Balut, we are driven to the conclusion that the declarations\u00a0 of Apolonio de la Cruz and\u00a0 Felix Camacho were in\u00a0 accordance\u00a0 with the facts and that\u00a0 the declarations of these two witnesses show\u00a0 beyond a\u00a0 reasonable doubt, that the defendant, Timoteo Romero,\u00a0 took a direct part in the\u00a0 commission of the robbery described in the complaint presented in the\u00a0 present cause, if he were not even the leader of said band of\u00a0 robbers.<\/p><p> With reference to the third\u00a0 assignment of error,\u00a0 to wit: that the lower court committed\u00a0 an error\u00a0 in qualifying\u00a0 the crime as that of robo en cuadrilla,\u00a0 with the aggravating circumstance of\u00a0 nocturnity, we are of the opinion,\u00a0 after a careful\u00a0 examination of the evidence,\u00a0 that the crime\u00a0 was properly qualified as that of <em>robo en cuadrilla<\/em>.\u00a0\u00a0 The evidence shows that it was committed at nighttime, in an uninhabited place.\u00a0 It will be remembered that\u00a0 Prudencio Carpio,\u00a0 the person in charge of the rice stolen and who was manacled and blindfolded at that time, testified that he cried\u00a0 out for help; that there were no persons living near the place where he\u00a0 was guarding the rice; that some\u00a0 fishermen who happened to be in the vicinity soon after the robbers left the place, heard his cries\u00a0 and came to his assistance and unmanacled him.\u00a0\u00a0 We think that the\u00a0 proof clearly shows that the place where the crime was committed was an uninhabited place.<\/p><p> The Attorney-General, the Honorable\u00a0 Ignacio\u00a0 Villamor, after a careful analysis of the evidence, makes the recommendation that the defendant and appellant should be sentenced to be imprisoned\u00a0 in\u00a0 the maximum degree of that provided for by paragraph 5 of article 503 in connection with\u00a0 articles 504 and\u00a0 505 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 With this recommendation\u00a0 we fully agree.\u00a0 A man who organizes a band\u00a0 for the purpose of robbing his neighbors of\u00a0 the just fruits of their labors, should receive but little mercy at the hands of the courts.\u00a0 Therefore, the sentence of the lower court\u00a0 is hereby reversed, and it is hereby ordered that the defendant and appellant, Timoteo Romero, be sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of nine years of <em>presidio mayor,<\/em> with\u00a0 the accessory\u00a0 penalties of the law, to indemnify the said Braulio Carbonel in the sum of P70, the value of the rice stolen\u00a0 and. not recovered,\u00a0 and to\u00a0 pay the costs.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><em>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

From this order an appeal has been taken by the Attorney-General.<\/p>\n<p>Virtually, it is stated in the order appealed from that the defendant grossly disobeyed the order  of the  justice of the peace court (Exhibits B and C) to deliver the land in question to Sabino Vayson; that such disobedience, were it punishable,  would fall within the sanction of sections 232 and 236 of Act No. 190  (Code of Procedure in Civil Actions), and not of article 252 of the Penal Code, which latter, in the opinion of the court, was repealed by the two former, in so far as it be incompatible therewith; and that, inasmuch as the said sections of Act No, 190 punish the disobedience to judicial orders only when these latter are legal, and that the order herein concerned  of the  justice of the peace is manifestly  illegal,  the  result follows as a necessary conclusion, according to the trial judge, that the disobedience charged to the defendant in the complaint does not constitute a penally actionable  matter, pursuant to the law.  And it is said in the  same order appealed from that the aforementioned order of the justice  of the  peace is illegal for the reason that it was issued in an action brought for the recovery of  possession of land, which could  not validly be heard by a justice of the peace court, as such classes of actions come exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Courts of First Instance.<\/p>\n<p>Section 232 of Act No, 190, cited in the order appealed from, provides, in part, as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"SEC. 232. <em>What other acts  are  contempts of court<\/em>.\u2014A person guilty of any of the following acts may be punished as for contempt:<\/p>\n<p>\"(a)  Disobedience of, or resistance to, a lawful writ, process, order, judgment, or command of a court, or injunction granted by a court or judge;<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">*       *      *       *       *      *       *\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Section 236 penalizes such acts of contempt with a fine that shall not exceed  one thousand pesos, or  imprisonment of not more than six months,  or both, in the discretion of the court.<\/p>\n<p>Article 252 of the Penal Code, cited in the complaint and which the trial court held to be repealed by the said sections of the Code of  Civil Procedure, is as follows: \"Art. 252. The persons who, without being included in article 249, should resist the authorities, or their agents, or should  grossly  disobey them  in the performance of the duties of their office, shall be punished with the penalties of arresto mayor and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 pesetas.\"<\/p>\n<p>The Attorney-General alleges as a ground for his appeal that the trial court erred in holding that  disobedience of judicial orders is not comprised within article 252 of the Penal Code and  that this  article was repealed by sections 232 and 236 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in so far as it was incompatible therewith.<\/p>\n<p>In view of the opinion we have formed of the facts alleged in the complaint, it becomes unnecessary for us to decide the aforementioned  questions set up in the Attorney-General's brief.  We  do  not  think that  the defendant  disobeyed any judicial order whatever.  The order issued by the justice of the peace  (Exhibit C) and alleged to have been disobeyed, is a writ of execution and addressed, as was natural and proper, to the competent sheriff, and not to the defendant,  In it the sheriff is commanded to place the plaintiff, Sabino Vayson, who had won in the suit against the herein defendant for the recovery of the property, in possession of the said disputed land.   Such command is  made solely and exclusively  to the  sheriff, and not tb  the defendant. Absolutely no order whatsoever is made to the latter; nothing is demanded of him and he is not restrained from doing anything, neither is  he required to do anything; he is not told to perform,  or not to perform, any act whatsoever; in a word, the writ or order in question in  no wise refers to him.   Nor could this process, indeed, be addressed to the defendant, for the reason that it wholly concerns the execution of a judgment, the serving of which is specially and exclusively incumbent upon the sheriff.  And  it is superfluous to add that the defendant  could hardly disobey an order that in no wise concerned him.  The order itself leaves this to be clearly understood by warning the sheriff, and no  one else, that he shall be liable to the penalties of the law in case of noncompliancc.  \"Failure to comply with this order,\" it says literally, \"will subject you,\" the sheriff, \"to the penalties of the law.5'  The  warning  is solely for the sheriff, because the writ must be served by him, and he alone it was who could fail to comply with or  disobey it<\/p>\n<p>But, while the defendant did  not  disobey the said writ of execution, may it be said that he disobeyed the sentence of the justice o^ the peace who ordered that he restore the disputed land to  the  plaintiff, Vayson?  It is contended by the Attorney-General in his brief  that he did.   He says that the act performed by the defendant in setting forth in Exhibit C-2 thai he was not  willing to deliver the land to Vayson was one of disobedience to the said sentence.   This may be  true, and undoubtedly is,  in a certain sense,\u2014in the same sense that it may be said  that he who  infringes or violates any law passed by the legislative power disobeys its  authority; or that the defendant who refuses to surrender himself voluntarily and of  his own free accord to the prison authorities for the purpose of serving his sentence disobeys the sentence that imposes imprisonment upon him. But this is not the disobedience that is punished as a crime by article 252 of the Penal Code.  The juridical conception of this  crime consists in a failure to comply with orders directly issued by the authorities in the exercise  of their official duties, and not with legal provisions of a general character, nor with judicial decisions merely declaratory of rights or obligations, such as those proper to be rendered in a civil suit relative to property or the possession of land, like that which gave rise to the present controversy.  Nor even  do the violations of prohibitory  decisions,  although undoubtedly of  a more serious  character,  constitute the crime of disobedience to the  authorities provided  for and punished by the aforecited article  of the Penal Code, for they give rise only to a civil action.   (Decisions of the supreme court of Spain of September  25  and October 4, 1889, and June  30, 1893.)<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the justice of the peace which is supposed to have been disobeyed, orders, it is true, the herein defendant to return the land, the subject of the suit, to the plaintiff,  Vayson, but it does not order him, nor could it legally order him, to effect the return himself.  As hereinbefore stated, this is the duty of the sheriff, to whom the law entrusts the execution of judgments.<\/p>\n<p>The Code of Civil Procedure contains the following provisions with respect to writs of execution :<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"SEC. 443.  <em>When execution may  issue<\/em>.\u2014The  party in whose favor judgment is given, may,  at any time  within five years after the entry thereof have a writ of execution issued for its  enforcement, as hereinafter provided.<\/p>\n<p>\"SEC. 444. <em>Issuance, form, and requisites of execution<\/em>.\u2014The execution must be issued in the name  of the United States of  America, Philippine Islands, sealed with the seal of the court, and subscribed by the judge, or clerk thereof, and be directed to the governor of the  province,  or any of his deputies, and must intelligibly refer to  the judgment, stating the court, and the province where the record of the judgment is  *  *  *,  and must  direct the governor or his deputy,  substantially as follows:<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * * * * * *<\/p>\n<p>\"(e)  If it be for the delivery of the possession  of real or personal property, it  must  require  the governor, or  his deputy, to deliver the possession of the  same, describing it, to the party entitled thereto.   *  *   *\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>According to  these sections, it is exclusively  incumbent upon the sheriff to execute, to carry out the mandates of the judgment  in question, and, in fact, it was he himself, and he alone,  who was ordered by the justice of  the peace who rendered  that judgment, to place the plaintiff, Vayson, in possession of the land.  The defendant in this  case had nothing to do  with that delivery of possession, and, consequently, his statements expressing his refusal or unwillingness to  effect  the same, are entirely  officious and impertinent and therefore could not hinder, and much less prevent, the delivery being made, had  the  sheriff known how to             comply with his duty.  It was  solely due to the latter's fault, and not to the alleged disobedience of the defendant, that the judgment was not duly executed.  For that purpose the sheriff could even have availed  himself  of the public force, had it been necessary to resort thereto.<\/p>\n<p>The Attorney-General brings up still another aspect of the case.  He states in his brief that the defendant grossly disobeyed an agent of the authorities, such as is the sheriff, by not delivering the land to Vayson, as he was ordered to do  by the said  sheriff.  In accordance with article  252 of the Penal Code, disobedience to the agents of the authorities is punishable only when they are in the exercise of the duties  that particularly pertain to their officef  As aforesaid, the duty of the sheriff in the present case  was to place Vayson in possession of the land.  Instead  of  so doing, he limited his action to telling or ordering the defendant to deliver the land to the  said Vayson.  In acting in this wise, not only did he fail duly to discharge his official duty, but he openly neglected to  perform the same. He had no right whatever to  require that the defendant should perform a duty which he himself ought to have performed: to do so, would  be tantamount  to  imposing one's own  duties upon another, which,  evidently, would be illegal   and  unjust. Under such circumstances, the defendant's  disobedience, if any there  were, does not constitute  the crime  aforementioned.<\/p>\n<p>Upon  the  foregoing grounds we hold  that  the facts alleged in the complaint do not  constitute a crime;  we, therefore; affirm the order appealed from, with the costs <em>de oficio.<\/em><\/p>\n<em>Arellano, C.

I think it proper, however, to indicate that as I understand it, the majority opinion  is not  to be  construed as holding that defendant would  not have been guilty of the offense defined and penalized in article 252 of the Penal Code had he refused to surrender possession of the property to the sheriff himself, upon demand therefor, in order that the sheriff himself might give possession to the person entitled thereto as indicated in the writ.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

As a rule, when it appears, as it does in this case, that the judge  has exercised care and diligence in selecting the guardian, and has given due consideration to the reasons for and against his action which are urged by the interested parties, his action should not be  disturbed unless  it is  made very clear that he has fallen into grievous error.<\/p>\n<p>In the  case  at bar, we  do not think that appellant has made such a showing and we do not believe therefore, that we would be justified in interfering with  the  appointment made by the experienced judge from whom this appeal has been taken.

He appealed, basing his whole case here upon the proposition that the evidence does not warrant the conviction.<\/p>\n<p>It appears that on the 19th day of January, 1911, one Severino Resume was engaged in painting telephone poles located  along the highway between  Jaro and Iloilo.  On that day he was killed by being run over  by an automobile driven by the defendant.  The highway at the point where Severino met his death was straight, of considerable width, and in  good  condition.   The telephone pole  upon  which Severino was at work at the time of the accident was outside of the beaten portion of the highway and located about 2 feet into the grass at  the side.   Between it and the edge of the road was a pathway used by people traveling on foot. The machine which  caused the death of the deceased is a large  passenger  automobile, seating 35  passengers, and having upon  each  side and extending about 2 feet  out beyond the wheels a rack or other contrivance for the carrying of parcels, baggage, and freight.  It is used solely for the purpose of carrying  passengers back and forth between Iloilo  and Jaro.<\/p>\n<p>The accident happened at about 10 o'clock in the morning. The automobile was  then engaged in making its third trip from  Iloilo to Jaro, and  was loaded to its fullest capacity. There were several  people  who  claim to have witnessed the accident.   One of them, the principal witness for the prosecution, and its  only witness who saw the occurrence, named Pablo Tayson, is alleged to have been standing within a few feet  of the deceased, talking with him, at the time he was run down.  Another person, who was near by at the time of the accident, was  Basilio Severaldo, who was engaged in the same work as the deceased but, just prior to the passage of the automobile, had gone away from the locality where the  accident occurred and saw nothing of what happened.  Two other persons, who have been  produced as witnesses for the defendant, allege that they were present and saw the whole occurrence.<\/p>\n<p>Pablo Tayson, who, as we have said, is the only witness for the  prosecution testifying  directly to the facts  and substantially the only witness upon  whom the prosecution relies  for  a  conviction, testified that at the time of the accident he and the deceased were located on the left-hand side of the highway going from Iloilo to Jaro; that he was standing a few feet  from the deceased who was also on the same side of the highway; that the deceased was  standing  up painting the  side of  the telephone  pole toward Jaro; that the telephone pole was, therefore, between the deceased and Iloilo, the direction from which the automobile was coming;  that the road on that day was very dusty and the automobile, as he saw it coming from Iloilo toward him and the deceased, was raising  a cloud  of dust which  was drifting to the side of the road upon which he and the deceased were located.  This witness further asserted that he saw the automobile when it was within about 1,200 feet of the place where he stood; that it was  coming at  a rate of speed variously termed by him \"very fast\" and \"at full speed;\" that,  on observing the machine as it approached, he saw that the driver, the accused, was turning the  steering wheel first in one direction  and then in the other, as if uncertain what course he was going to pursue; that the machine, as a consequence, was darting first to one side of the road and then to the  other, thus zigzagging back  and forth across the traveled portion of the highway; that just before reaching the place where deceased was painting the telephone pole it crossed to the side of the road opposite to him and then suddenly started back across the road,  striking the deceased as he stood painting; that by the impact the deceased  was thrown  upon  the  ground somewhat toward the front of the machine, which was going so fast that, although the accused was not within the reach of  its wheels, nevertheless, the \"suction,\" as the witness called it, created  by  the swift  passage of the machine drew the deceased  under  its  wheels  where he was  run over and crushed.<\/p>\n<p>From the testimony of this witness it does not  appear that the  deceased moved or stirred in any  way until  he was hit by the automobile.<\/p>\n<p>The accused testified, and produced several witnesses to support his  testimony, that  at the time of the accident he was driving the machine, which  was loaded to its fullest capacity  with passengers and baggage, at about 10 to  15 miles an hour; that he was driving in or near the center of the road; that there was no person in the highway and no vehicle or other obstruction which required him to leave the center of the  road and pass to either  side; that the machine was under full control and was going steadily and smoothly without deviating to the right or to the left; that on approaching the place where the witness Pablo Tayson stood he saw him turn his back toward the road and place his cap  over his face in such a way as to cover his nose, mouth and eyes, evidently to  protect  them from the cloud of dust  which was rolling from behind the machine over toward the  side of  the road  on  which he  was; that the deceased,  as the machine approached,  probably seeing the cloud of dust which  it was raising and which would inevitably drift in his  direction, and observing his companion, Pablo Tayson,  under the necessity of protecting himself from the dust in the manner described, just before the machine reached a point opposite him, started to cross the road to the other side, evidently to escape the dust; that he  misjudged the distance  and started  too late; that in attempting to cross he placed himself squarely in front of the machine; that his movement was so sudden and unexpected and,  when  he reached  the road, he was so close to the machine that  it was impossible to stop it in time to avert the catastrophe; that  he did  everything that was possible to be done to avoid the  accident; that he put on both brakes as hard as possible and turned the machine as much as could be done under the circumstances; that in proof thereof he  shows that only the front wheel of the machine passed over the body  of the deceased, it having been turned by  him  sufficiently  so that the hind  wheel missed him, and that the machine was stopped a very few feet beyond the point  where the accident occurred.   The accused testified, and his evidence in this regard is uncontradicted,  that he was thoroughly qualified as a  driver, having served his  apprenticeship on this very road and this very machine before being employed.<\/p>\n<p>The accused denies  absolutely that portion of the story told by Pablo Tayson in which he alleges that the accused was driving at a, high rate of speed; that he was zigzagging from one side of the road to the other; and that he struck the deceased while he stood painting the telephone pole.<\/p>\n<p>We are satisfied that  the  evidence  is  not  sufficient to convict.   On the contrary, we believe that, under all of the facts and circumstances of the case, the fair preponderance of the evidence indicates that the deceased met his death in substantially the manner described by the accused.  In the first place, the testimony of Pablo Tayson is affected by an attack made upon his credibility during the progress of the trial.  It was shown that, on the preliminary investigation had by the justice of the peace, this witness testified, precisely as  the accused asserted in his evidence, that just as the machine was  arriving at a point in the highway opposite him, he, desiring to  avoid the unpleasantness of the dust, turned his back toward the road and covered his face with his cap, thereby excluding the dust from his mouth, eyes, and nostrils.  That he so testified on the preliminary investigation,  according to the record thereof, is admitted.  In his  testimony on the trial  of this case he stated, at first, that he turned his right side  to the road and placed his hand over the side of his face, leaving his eyes uncovered, so that he was able to see and did  see the deceased at the  time  he was run down.  Upon  cross-examination  he changed  this testimony to the extent of saying that he covered the right side of his face with his cap instead of his hand, maintaining, however, that he did not cover his eyes and that he was able to see the deceased and  all that transpired.  When confronted with the  evidence which he gave on the preliminary examination, he sought to explain the difference between his  two declarations by stating that the testimony before the justice of the peace, which was reduced to writing and signed by him, was in a different language from that which he  was able to speak and that it was not translated so that he knew what he was signing.<\/p>\n<p>In  the second place, the  testimony of  this witness is unreasonable.   It is improbable that a  machine as large as the one in question, going at the rate of speed described by Pablo Tayson, could zigzag from one side of the highway to  the other in  the manner described by the witness. It is  still more  improbable  that this machine could have dodged from the right-hand side of the road to the left and, in some unknown manner,  picked the deceased out from behind the telephone pole, dragged him  into the highway and there run over him.  It  is not clear how an automobile can run over a  man when it is admitted that he  is  on the opposite  side of a  telephone post from the machine which runs him down,  with  only a portion  of his body extending beyond it.   Even  if the machine had started toward him in the manner  described he would undoubtedly have  seen it quickly enough to have passed  around  the other side of the post and  save himself from being touched. This is  especially evident when  we observe that it  is  admitted that the deceased  stood  facing the automobile all the time and could see it  plainly and its every movement. It is difficult to believe that  a machine  of the size of  the one in question,  driven at the high rate of speed alleged by the witness, could have turned suddenly, darted toward  the ditch, and struck the deceased while located partly on  the opposite  side of a post from the machine  without having collided with the post  or gone into the ditch, it being remembered that the post was not more than 6 feet from the ditch.<\/p>\n<p>From  the description given  of the machine it appears, as we have  already seen, that there were certain portions of the body  of the machine extending over and beyond the wheels,  which were used as receptacles for  the baggage and  bundles of passengers.   This projection, under the theory of the prosecution, would necessarily have been the portion of the machine to hit the  deceased for the reason that no  other  part of the machine could  have come in contact with him without the projection referred to striking the  telephone pole.  If this projection is that which struck the deceased first, then he would have  been thrown into the  ditch  away from the machine and not into the highway under the machine.   This  is what would necessarily have happened when we remember that at the time the deceased was struck  the machine  was going  at full speed toward  the ditch.  It  was apparently to avoid the contradiction of  his previous  testimony inherent in this necessary result that the witness testified that the force which  prevented the deceased from  going into the  ditch and drew him under the machine was the \"suction\" created by its rapid passage along the highway.<\/p>\n<p>It is the undisputed evidence of the case that that portion of the  machine which struck the  deceased first was the mudguard over the left wheel.   This fact alone shows the impossibility of the machine having hit  the deceased while standing at the  post, as it is admitted  that no part of the automobile collided with the post.  If  the deceased had  been at the post,  as  described by  Tayson, the guard could not possibly have struck him without the extended portions  above  described having struck the post itself.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand,  the story told by the  accused and supported by some of the passengers who saw the accident is entirely reasonable, accords with common sense and ordinary experience.   It was  clearly told, in a manner frank        and  straightforward,  was free from contradictions  and needs no explanation or excuses.<\/p>\n<p>We have read with detention the opinion upon  which the judgment of conviction is  based.  In spite  of careful study,  we  are unable to  discover anything therein  that alters our views in relation to the merits.  As between the two theories, the one of the prosecution and the other of the defense, we cannot have, under the evidence and record, any hesitation in choosing.  The evidence presented by the prosecution itself, and it is upon that evidence  alone  that the conviction must stand, every other fact in  the record being conspicuously  in exculpation of the accused,  shows the deceased standing upon  the  east side of a telephone pole facing an automobile coming toward him from the west, about half of his body extending beyond the pole toward the highway on his left.   On his right  was the highway drainage ditch.  The pole was outside of the traveled  portion  of the highway so far that a footpath lay  between  it and  said  traveled portion.  The automobile was coming toward  him  at  a high rate  of speed, to judge from the evidence of this witness, at least 40 miles an hour, possibly more.  The machine was not proceeding in a straight line but it was going from one side of the road to the  other. Just before arriving opposite the deceased it darted  to the right-hand side of the road  and then, turning, it started toward the left-hand side directly at  the deceased.   All of these things the deceased saw, yet  he  did not move or attempt to save himself in any way.  On the contrary, he stood still  and permitted  the machine to strike him upon his left side.  Having collided with him, the machine turned back toward the center of the highway, carrying the deceased with it, depositing him within the traveled portion of the highway, where it ran over him.  On the other hand, the evidence of the defendant shows that he was driving the machine at a moderate rate of speed within  the usually traveled portion of the highway, guiding  it in  a substantially straight line  and handling it in the usual and ordinary manner.  The machine, one of extraordinary size and capable of carrying 35 passengers with their baggage and effects,  was incapable of running at the rate of speed described by the prosecution.  Arriving at a point in the highway just in front of the deceased, the latter, to avoid the cloud of dust which was drifting to his side of the  road, started to cross the road to the other side.  He miscalculated the time and distance and as a  result was struck by the automobile and run over.   His action in starting across the  road  was  so  sudden  and unexpected  and, when  he reached the road,  he was. so close to the automobile, that it was impossible to stop the machine in time to save him. The body was picked up within the traveled portion of the highway.<\/p>\n<p>Which of these two stories is the most reasonable?  We have no hesitation in  answering.   The story of the prosecution  presents so many things that are unreasonable and incredible and for which there exists in the record no explanation whatever,  and concerning which no reasonable explanation  can be given, that it must necessarily be rejected.   Even if, going at such  a high rate of speed, the accused could have driven the automobile from one side of the road to the other as alleged, what could possibly be his reason for so doing?  It was market  day at Jaro; this was  his  third trip; the machine was loaded to its  utmost capacity, both with passengers and with  baggage; he was doubtless running according to a schedule and would have no time to waste  in  going from one  side of the road to the other; no  reason is suggested and  none can be  supplied why a driver should handle his machine in the manner described by the only  witness for the prosecution who saw the whole occurrence.   Instead of keeping to the traveled portion of the highway, which was admittedly in fine condition, why should the accused go outside of it, across a footpath used by  pedestrians, and skim alongside of the telephone  poles located on that side?   What object could he have had in thus exposing  himself,  his passengers,  and his machine to the risks and dangers of plunging into  the drainage  ditch or driving against the telephone poles or of meeting the other disasters and dangers which might be encountered outside of the usually traveled portion of the highway?  No explanation of such extraordinary conduct is given in the record and none can be conceived.  He was not engaged in taking a party of hilarious companions on a \"joy\"  ride, nor in giving an exhibition  of his skill in handling an  automobile of that  size and class.   It does  not  appear  that he was drunk or foolish.   He was engaged in a business enterprise, employed by a business man for business purposes. What could possibly have been his purpose when, on arriving at a point in front of the deceased, he turned his automobile across the road  and  started  squarely  toward the telephone pole and the deceased?  That he saw the deceased and that the deceased saw him is admitted.  What spirit or purpose could have animated him  in driving his automobile outside of the highway directly toward not only a telephone  post but the  drainage ditch itself in order to run down an unoffending person?  What motive can be assigned  by the prosecution, when  it  asserts  that the accused did this  unaccountable thing?   What purpose does the prosecution allege the accused sought to subserve when, by this conduct,  he placed the safety of his passengers and of his machine, as well as of himself, at stake in thus driving directly toward  a place of great danger?  Above all, why  did  the  deceased stand still,  instead of stepping around behind the post,  and  permit himself to be crushed to death by  the machine  which  he clearly saw  bearing down upon him?  These unreasonable and unaccountable things must be satisfactorily explained by the prosecution when it  is confronted  by the statement  of  the  accused, supported by a number of  disinterested  witnesses, that none  of  those things ever  occurred.  We have  already pointed out that, giving the  story as told  by  the  prosecution credence, it would have been little short of an impossibility for the body of the deceased to have found itself in the traveled portion  of the highway after the accident. He would inevitably have been driven further away from the highway and toward the ditch by the blow from the machine going in the direction in which it was alleged by the prosecution to have been going.<\/p>\n<p>Turning to the story of the event  as given by the defendant and his witnesses, we meet nothing that requires explanation.   There can, therefore, be no hesitation on our part  in  accepting the  truth of the story told by the defendant.<\/p>\n<p>Although we have held in a recent case (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Reyes, 10 Off. Gaz., 1045), a criminal action for homicide by <em>imprudencia, temeraria,<\/em> that  contributory negligence on the part of the person killed  is no defense, provided the driver of the automobile himself was negligent and that negligence was the proximate cause of the death,  nevertheless, that doctrine does not in  any way inveigh against the proposition which we here assert that, where death is due to the negligence of the decedent  himself and not  to the  negligence of the  driver of the automobile, the latter cannot be held for homicide.  In  this case the death of the deceased was due entirely to his own negligence.   There  is  not sufficient reliable proof in  the  record to establish  negligence on the  part of the accused.  There being no  negligence, he is not  responsible, no matter what the result of the accident may have  been.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of conviction is reversed and the accused acquitted.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

The third contention of appellant is that the ordinance by its terms does not author or prescribe a fee for\" the testing of the meters on account of which the action is brought. Counsel\u00a0 insist that section 23 of ordinance No. 68 o city of Manila, which provides fees for the official tests of meters has reference only to tests made under the provisions of\u00a0 the next preceding section (22), which relates to tests made when there is a new installation electric lights, and not to tests made under authority of section 5,\u00a0 which relates\u00a0 to tests\u00a0 made of meters disconnected for repairs. The fees for which this action was brought were for tests of this\u00a0 latter class.<\/p><p>We think it is very clear, however, that the scale of fees set out\u00a0 in s 23 was clearly intended to apply\u00a0 to\u00a0 all cases wherein tests of meters made under authority of the ordinance.\u00a0 The section provides that \"The f for each inspection and test herein provided shall\u00a0 be as follows.\" We t that the words \"inspection\u00a0 and test herein provided\" clearly refer to a inspections and tests provided in the ordinance.\u00a0\u00a0 The mere fact that section 23 immediately succeeds section 22, and that the scale of fees provided section\u00a0 23 was undoubtedly intended to have application to cases arising under section 22 by no means justifies the conclusion\u00a0 that this\u00a0 scale has no reference to tests authorized under any other section of the ordinance.\u00a0\u00a0 If the scale of fees set forth\u00a0 in section 23 applied\u00a0 only cases arising\u00a0 under section 22, it would seem that instead of using gen language,\u00a0 which is applicable to\u00a0 all tests made\u00a0 by authority of the ordinance, it would have limited the\u00a0 collection of fees\u00a0 to cases arising section 22 by specifically referring to tests\u00a0 provided \"in section 22\" next preceding section.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, if the scale of fees were intended\u00a0 to apply only to section 22, its logical place\u00a0 in the ordinance would be w the body of that\u00a0 section\u00a0 itself. Moreover, looking at the purpose and object sought to\u00a0 be attained by establishing a scale\u00a0 of fees for the testing of meters,\u00a0 it would seem not less reasonable and proper that fees should\u00a0 be charged\u00a0 for tests made in cases where re-installations are be made of old and defective meters removed for the purpose of making repairs, than that they should be charged in\u00a0 cases where new meters are tested.<\/p><p>The judgment of the\u00a0 court below should be and is hereby affirmed.<\/p><p><em>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

In this month of April, 1909, while the latter was one day going to her cousin's to get some rice, she saw the carabao in a river, in the <i>sitio<\/i> of Hinubigon, about 5 or 6 kilometers distant from that of Cabasan where she resided, but as it was late she determined to return the next day to see it again, which she did, in company with Andres Llorna and Daniel Barola, and they found the animal in the same place. Leoncio Marte told her that Policarpo Cerna was the party who had the carabao. Leoncio Marte, in fact, testified that he saw Policarpo Cerna catch the carabao in the month of January, 1903, in Hinubigon, the animal being loose at the time, and when asked why he had caught it, the latter replied that it was his <i>share<\/i>, that Policarpo Cerna had not ceased to possess it since then, and that witness was aware of these facts as they were neighbors. The carabao was branded L T, the initials of Sabina Merenguel's husband, but over the old brand there had been marked the initials M C, which appear to be those of Modesto Cerna, whose branding iron, however, did not fit these last letters.<br\/><br\/>Policarpo Cerna testified that the carabao belonged to his elder brother, Valeriano Cerna, and the latter swore on the stand that the animal in question had been given to him by his brother, Modesto Cerna, in exchange for another carabao of his own which Modesto had borrowed from him. Santiago Cerna claimed and maintained that the carabao in controversy belonged to his father, Modesto, and said that they might bring suit to recover the animal, if they wished, but that he would not deliver it.<br\/><br\/>The Court of First Instance of Leyte, before which the case was heard, found the defendants guilty of theft, as defined in paragraph 1 of article 517 of the Penal Code and therefore sentenced them to four months and one day of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>, to restore the stolen carabao to Sabina Merenguel or, if its restitution was impossible, to pay her its value, the sum of P110; to suffer, in case of insolvency, the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>From the letter transmitting the case to this court, it appears that only Policarpo Cerna appealed from the judgment, as shown by his notification; however, the record does not show that Valeriano Cerna failed to appeal and submitted to the judgment.<br\/><br\/>What is certain is that the party who was required by the clerk of this court to defend himself, in this second instance, was Valeriano Cerna, and the attorney who made the defense <i>de oficio<\/i> presented his brief in the name of the two defendants, Policarpo and Valeriano Cerna.<br\/><br\/>In this manner the appeal was heard.<br\/><br\/>This court can not affirm the application to the case at bar of paragraph 1 of article 517 of the Penal Code, because, in accordance with this provision, \"those who, with intent of gain and without violence or intimidation against the person or force against things, shall <i>take<\/i> another's personal property without the owner's consent,\" are guilty of theft; and, in the present case, the accused did not <i>take<\/i>, but found, the carabao in question, which, according to the woman who claims to be its owner, had been lost by her, and, as testified by the witness, Leoncio Marte, was caught by Policarpo Cerna in Hinubigon, distant 5 or 6 kilometers from Cabasan, the place of residence of the said woman, Sabina Merenguel, who began her testimony by saying that \"when that carabao was lost it followed other carabaos of Julian Nay re toward Hinubigon, where the latter took his animals to his mother's house, and, after passing through the <i>sitio<\/i> of Panamgan, it separated from Nayre's animals.\" It is an elementary principle that theft consists essentially in taking another's personal property <i>from the 'place where it is held by its legitimate owner<\/i>. (Viada, art. 530, Penal Code of Spain.)<br\/><blockquote> \"It stands to reason and is confirmed by established principles of law\u2014says Manresa\u2014that the word <i>take<\/i>, as employed in paragraph 1 of article 530 of the Penal Code (517 of that of the Philippines), must be rationally interpreted as the act of taking a thing from the <i>possession<\/i> of its owner and bringing it into the possession of the guilty party. The thing abandoned, the thing lost, is not in the possession of its owner, is not at the place where it should be at the disposal of such owner, but is, on the contrary, at the disposal of anyone. * * * In principle, it may be affirmed\u2014so he concludes\u2014without hesitation or doubt, that the case to which we refer is not comprised within paragraph 1 of article 530. It was so understood by the legislators since, in amending the Penal Code of 1850, they added the paragraph No. 2 as something new and special not included in paragraph No. 1.\" (5 Manresa, Civil Code, 47.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Paragraph 2 of article 530 of the code of Spain, identical with article 517 of that of the Philippines, reads thus:<br\/><blockquote> \"The following are guilty of theft: * * *<br\/><br\/>\"2. Those who, finding something lost and knowing who its owner is, appropriate it with the intent of profit.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Continuing his commentary, the learned jurist also takes up the question as to whether paragraph 2 of article 530 (517 of the Philippines) may be applied to the case in hand, and he arrives at this conclusion:<br\/><blockquote>\"Neither may it be applied, because, when the owner is not known, there is lacking an essential requisite, for the constitution of the crime referred to. Only in the case where the person who found the thing should come to know who was the owner of it and should continue to keep it, might it be said that theft was committed.\" (<i>Id<\/i>., 48.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The defendants knew that Sabina Merenguel claimed to be the owner of the carabao, in April, 1909, six years and four months after she had lost it, in December, 1902. This being so, could they be guilty of theft under paragraph 2 of the afore-cited article 517, because they continued to keep the carabao, notwithstanding that Sabina Merenguel had informed them that she was its owner? To claim to be the owner does not make one the owner. For this reason, in the present status of the case, the courts must decide who is the owner. The defendants can not now, after the lapse of six years from the finding of the carabao, which was without owner and at large, be deemed guilty, of the crime of theft. This is a new phase of the case at bar, which brings it within the prescriptions of the civil law and withdraws it from the sphere of action of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>Should a person appear to claim a domestic animal six years after it was found roaming at large, its owner being unknown, it may not be taken for granted that such person is the owner thereof and that he who found it should be considered guilty of theft.<br\/><br\/>The fourteenth provision of the Law of Bases provided that taking possession should be defined as one of the means of acquisition; that rights should be regulated over domestic animals, accidental finding of treasure and appropriation of abandoned personal property. The Civil Code, in its articles 111, 112 and 113 [611-613], treats of the loss and acquisition of wild and tamed animals. With respect to tame or domestic animals, as well as all other abandoned chattels, the only article applicable is article 116 [615], which prescribes as follows:<br\/><blockquote> \"A person finding any personal property, which is not treasure, must return it to its former possessor. Should the latter be unknown, he must deliver it immediately to the mayor of the town where the find was made,\"<br\/><br\/>\"Is the act of appropriating personal property found a lawful act? The finder of the thing must return it to its owner, if the latter is known, or, if he is unknown, deposit it with the mayor. If he does not do so, prescription is required to enable the finder or a third person to acquire title to the find; and the former, as a general rule, must have possessed it for the extraordinary term of six years, on account of the lack of good faith and because, for the same reason, his possession is not equivalent to a title, with the exception however of the provisions of article 1956. * * *. (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Id.<\/span>, 46.)<br\/><br\/>\"The possession of personal property, acquired in good faith, is equivalent to a title thereto.\" (Civil Code, 464.)<br\/><br\/>\"The ownership of personal property prescribes by uninterrupted possession in good faith for a period of three years.\" (Civ. Code, art. 1955, par. 1.)<br\/><br\/>\"The ownership of personal property also prescribes by uninterrupted possession for six years, without the necessity of any other condition.\" (<i>Id.<\/i>, par. 2.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Leoncio Marte, a witness for the prosecution, certified to Policarpo Cerna's uninterrupted possession from January 1, 1903, to April, 1909; and his affirmation is in no wise contradicted, but rather is confirmed by all the witnesses for the prosecution, and by Sabina Merenguel herself, who demands the recovery of her ownership and premises the possession of the Cernas since 1903 in order that she may be enabled to demand the possession from the latter; only she has chosen for the purpose a criminal action, taking it for granted that, first, she is the owner; and second, that, notwithstanding the loss of the animal for more than six years, she is still the owner thereof: while, on the contrary, these premises may not be discussed except in a civil suit.<br\/><br\/>With respect to this criminal action, the conclusions are:<br\/><br\/>1. That the defendants can not be guilty of theft under paragraph 2, of article 517 of the Penal Code, since, from January 1, 1903, when they took possession of the animal, to April, 1909, they did not know who was the owner thereof; and, in order that liability may attach for theft, pursuant to the provision just above cited, it is necessary that the appropriation, with intent of gain, of the thing lost, be made, \"knowing who is its owner.\"<br\/><br\/>2. That when the defendants learned, in April, 1909, who claimed to be the owner of the carabao, they had already possessed the lost animal for an uninterrupted period of six years; and the ownership of personal property prescribes by uninterrupted possession for six years, without the necessity of any other condition.<br\/><br\/>3. That if, on January 1, 1903, they had known who was the owner of the animal, they then would have committed the crime of theft as defined in the afore-cited provision, and would not then have been able to gain by prescription the ownership of the said carabao, except through the prescription of the crime or its penalty and the action demanding civil damages as a result of the crime (Civil Code, 1956); but this provision is not applicable to the present case, because the defendants are not guilty of theft,, nor was the carabao stolen, as established by facts perfectly proven.<br\/><br\/>4. That, the owner of a thing found being unknown, its appropriation does not constitute theft, although the finding may or may not constitute a title of acquisition for the finder, and may or may not be a reason for the loss of the ownership by the original owner: all this is a matter for ventilation in a civil action.<br\/><br\/>5. As to whether the finding could or could not result in the loss of ownership for the one and the title of acquisition for the other, there is involved the question whether the thing found was or was not delivered into the custody of the mayor and as to what civil effects are derived from a failure to make such a deliverance. It is certain, however, that this failure to deliver into the custody of the mayor does not constitute a crime, nor does it add any element whatever to the crime defined in paragraph 2 of article 517 of the Penal Code, and is not, therefore, an act or omission penalized by law.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the judgment whereby the defendants were found guilty of theft does not appear to be in accord with the merits of the case.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is reversed, the complaint is dismissed and the costs are assessed <i>de oficio<\/i>,<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Moreland, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<\/div>",

that, of the defendants, Benita Gatchalian is a widow, Petrona, Emeteria and Leoncia, single, and Gabriela, the wife of the said Panong; that Benita Gatchalian, by order of July 27, was appointed administratrix, conjointly with the plaintiff, of the estate of the said deceased, the required letters of administra tion having been issued to her, although, by a writing of the date of August 6, Gatchalian tendered her resignation as administratrix, which was accepted by the court, wherefore the plaintiff was the sole party upon whom it was incumbent by law to fulfill the said office; that the defendants Petrona, Emeteria, Leoncia and Gabriela were then in charge of a part of the estate of the deceased and were under the care and direction of the defendant Gatchalian; that the deceased, Dionisio Fulgencio, legally married, in second wedlock, the defendant Benita Gatchalian, with whom he did not have, during the time they were married, any surviving or posthumous child, and left only one legitimate son, by his first marriage, named Fernando Fulgencio, who was living with the plaintiff; that Dionisio Fulgencio, on marrying Gatchalian, brought the sum of 2,500 pesos Mexican currency as his own private property; that the conjugal partnership of the deceased Fulgencio with the said Gatchalian, and the aforementioned sum, produced, up to the time of the husband's death, several thousand pesos, all the property of the said partnership consisting of the following:<br\/><blockquote><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr valign=\"top\"> <td width=\"5%\"><div align=\"left\">A. <\/div><\/td> <td width=\"80%\"><div align=\"justify\">A house of mixed material, constructed on land belonging to a third party and situated on calle Rizal of the pueblo of Bautista, assessed at <\/div><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\" width=\"15%\">P400.00<\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><br\/><\/td> <td><br\/><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\"><br\/><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><div align=\"left\">B.<\/div><\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\">A lot containing a warehouse, built of strong materials and with four doors, on the same street and in the same pueblo, assessed at <\/div><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\">602.90<\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><br\/><\/td> <td><br\/><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\"><br\/><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><div align=\"left\">C.<\/div><\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\">A bakery, called \"El Porvenir,\" with all its accessories and stock, and a cigar and cigarette stand, installed in the house previously described, the reasonable value of all of which is<\/div><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\">600.00<\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><br\/><\/td> <td><br\/><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\"><br\/><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><div align=\"left\">D.<\/div><\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\">A bazar of foreign and domestic articles and a shop for the sale of cloth, installed in the said warehouse and reasonably worth <\/div><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\">1,000.00<\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><br\/><\/td> <td><br\/><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\"><br\/><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><div align=\"left\">E. <\/div><\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\">A share of stock in a cockpit in the municipality of Bautista, worth<\/div><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\">650.00<\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><br\/><\/td> <td><br\/><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\"><br\/><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><div align=\"left\">F.<\/div><\/td> <td> <div align=\"justify\">Three carabaos, reasonably worth, altogether<\/div><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\">120.00<\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><br\/><\/td> <td><br\/><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\"><br\/><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><div align=\"left\">G. <\/div><\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\">Various articles of household furniture, reasonably worth, altogether <\/div><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\">100.00<\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><br\/><\/td> <td><br\/><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\"><br\/><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><div align=\"left\">H.<\/div><\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\">Four shops for the sale of cloth, situated in the market of Bautista, worth altogether, at a reasonable valuation<\/div><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\">1,000.00<\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><div align=\"justify\"><\/div><\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\"><\/div><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\">-------------<\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td><br\/><\/td> <td><div align=\"justify\">Total<\/div><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: right;\">4,472.90<\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table> <\/blockquote>That all the property afore-described belonged exclusively to the conjugal partnership of the deceased Dionisio Fulgencio and the defendant Benita Gatchalian, with the exception of the said sum of 2,500 pesos Mexican currency; that the property described in the first seven paragraphs above was under the control and in the legal possession of the defendants Benita Gatchalian, Petrona Clavo, Emeteria Cristobal, Leoncia Belen and Gabriela Lopez, and that the defendant Gatchalian was, with the exception of such property, insolvent; that a demand having repeatedly been made upon the defendants for the friendly delivery by them of the said property, they categorically refused to deliver the same, and that such property was liable to disappear and suffer material damage unless a receiver were appointed for its preservation and administration during the pendency of the suit, as indeed a part of the property in question had already disappeared.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff asked that a person, whose name was not expressed, be appointed as receiver of the property described in the 8th paragraph of her complaint, and that the court order that, after taking oath and giving bond, the defendants deliver, to the receiver appointed,the property aforementioned; that in due season judgment be rendered declaring that Dionisio Fulgencio, on marrying Benita Gatchalian, brought to the marriage the sum of 2,500 pesos, which should be deducted from the community property; that the other property enumerated belongs exclusively to the conjugal partnership; that the plaintiff has a perfect right to ask for the appointment of a receiver who shall be entitled to the possession of the said property for the purpose of preserving and administering it, and that judgment be rendered in her behalf, against the defendants.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendants, answering the preceding complaint, set forth: that the defendants Petrona Clavo, Emeteria Cristobal, Leoncia Belen, and Gabriela Lopez, instead of the erroneous names under which the last three appear to have been designated, denied absolutely each and all of the facts alleged against them in the complaint; and that the defendant Benita Gatchalian admitted the facts related in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, but specifically denied those referred to in paragraphs 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, of the same.<br\/><br\/>As a special defense, Gatchalian added that her deceased husband, Dionisio Fulgencio, on his marriage with her, brought as property of his own only a few articles from his drug store, amounting to the sum of 100 pesos; that the defendant Gatchalian, on her marriage with the said deceased, brought 9,000 pesos in cash and 3,000 pesos in goods; that the profits obtained by the widow Gatchalian, in the business in which she engaged with the said sum, as well as with the 100 pesos brought in by her deceased husband, were squandered by the latter in his lifetime in gambling, and that consequently, the capital brought to the marriage by Gatchalian, far from increasing, was considerably diminished; that all the property designated under the letters A to G, paragraph 8 of the complaint, was acquired by the defendant Gatchalian with her own funds, except the effects mentioned under letters C and D, which were the subject matter of current accounts, yet unsettled, with various commercial houses in Manila; that the receivership for the property in litigation, as adjudged by the court, was unnecessary for the reasons already stated, and as shown by the affidavits attached, and that the defendant Gatchalian would suffer considerable and irreparable loss and detriment were an order not issued directing the discharge of the receiver; and she further petitioned the court for the discontinuance of the receivership of the property in question and the discharge of the said receiver from his office, in accordance with section 180 of Act No. 190, and offered to give bond, should the court so require, as security for the property in litigation and for any loss and damages which might be found in behalf of the plaintiff, and finally, asked that all the defendants be absolved from the complaint, stating that the property specified under letters A, B, C, D, E, F, and G did not belong to the conjugal partnership, but exclusively to the defendant, Benita Gatchalian, and asked that the plaintiff be sentenced to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>The guardian of the minor Fernando Fulgencio, by a writing of October 10, 1908, set forth that the latter was the legitimate son of the deceased spouses Dionisio Fulgencio and Tecla Monzon who died intestate, the former in Calasiao on June 30, 1908, and the latter in the city of Manila on June 4, 1897; that the deceased Monzon was the first wife of Fulgencio, and left as her sole heir by operation of law the said minor, with property in Manila consisting of a native dry-goods store, which property was sold unconditionally by her deceased husband on December 30, 1897, for 3,000 pesos Mexican currency, half of which sum, or 1,500 pesos, belonged to the minor, Fernando Fulgencio, as the heir by force of law of the deceased Tecla Monzon, but remained in the control of his father Fulgencio during the latter's lifetime and was brought by him upon his marriage, in second wedlock, with the defendant Benita Gatchalian and included in the estate left by the deceased Dionisio Fulgencio, which estate was being illegally held by the defendant; that the said sum of 1,500 pesos should bear legal interest at six per cent per annum from December 30, 1897, until it should be delivered to the minor, its owner, who several times demanded of the plaintiff, Josefa Fulgencio, and of the defendants, the delivery to him of the said sum, with interest, in Philippine currency; that they refused to accede to the claim of the said minor, who thereby suffered damage to the amount of 100 pesos; therefore, the guardian prayed that judgment be rendered sentencing the defendants Benita Gatchalian, Petrona Clavo, Emeteria Cristobal, Leoncia Belen and Gabriela Lopez to deliver to the said minor the said sum of 1,500 pesos Mexican currency, or its equivalent in Philippine currency, together with legal interest thereon, secured by the property of the intestate estate of the deceased Dionisio Fulgencio, to the payment of 100 pesos for loss and damage, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendants, in answer to the complaint of the intervener, Fernando Fulgencio, made a specific and general denial of each and all of the allegations of each and all of the paragraphs of the said complaint.<br\/><br\/>As a special defense, they all set up the same allegations of the special defense contained in the written answer to the complaint of the administratrix, Josefa Fulgencio.<br\/><br\/>On motion for dismissal, they set forth: That the claim of the intervener has for its purpose the collection of money from the intestate estate of Dionisio Fulgencio, wherefore the said claim should, be dismissed in accordance with section 119, in connection with sections 669, 686, 700, and 703, of the Code of Civil Procedure; that the intervener, as the son and heir of the deceased Dionisio Fulgencio, is not entitled to sue the defendant administratrix until his share of the estate shall have been adjudicated to him, pursuant to section 704 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and therefore they asked for the absolution of the defendants from the dismissal of this case with respect to the intervener, with the costs against the former.<br\/><br\/>After the trial and the introduction of evidence adduced by the parties, the court, on December 29, 1908, rendered judgment absolving the defendant, Gabriela Lopez, from the complaint, and sentencing the defendants, Benita Gatchalian, Petrona Clavo, Emeteria Cristobal, and Leoncia Belen, to deliver to the plaintiff the property of the estate of the deceased Dionisio Fulgencio, which they were retaining in their possession, and to pay the costs, dismissed the other petitions of the complaint and answer as well as the claim of the intervener, Fernando Fulgencio, and discharged the receiver, Aproniano Santos, canceling the bond executed by the latter. To this judgment the defendants excepted and moved for a rehearing on the grounds that the evidence did not sufficiently support the judgment and that the latter was contrary to law, equity and justice, and announced their intention to appeal, which motion was overruled by an order of November 11, 1909. Exception thereto was taken by the defendants, and, the proper bill of exceptions being presented, the same was approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>It is sought in this litigation to have the judicial administratrix of the intestate succession of the deceased Dionisio Fulgencio given possession of the property of different kinds, which constitute the estate of the said deceased and are now under the control of the latter's widow, Benita Gatchalian, and the other defendants.<br\/><br\/>The said widow was appointed administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband, jointly with the plaintiff, Josef a Fulgencio, a sister of the latter; but the widow, Benita Gatchalian, expressly renounced the appointment, and Josef a Fulgencio remained the sole administratrix of the intestate estate and, in the fulfillment of the duties of her office, among other things asked that there be restored to her the possession of the property left by the deceased, consisting chiefly of conjugal partnership property, in order that she might preserve and administer the same as belonging to the estate of which she was the administratrix.<br\/><br\/>The defendants denied the allegations of the complaint, and one of them, the said widow, Benita Gatchalian alleged: that her deceased husband only brought, when they were married, certain drugstore effects which were worth about one hundred pesos, while she brought to the conjugal partnership 9,000 pesos in cash and goods to the value of 3,000 pesos, and acquired by use of her funds the property described in the complaint, expecting a portion thereof which was the subject matter of accounts current, yet unsettled, with various commercial firms of Manila; she therefore prayed that they be absolved from the complaint, and that the property described in the complaint be held to be the private exclusive property of the widow, Benita Gatchalian, and not conjugal partnership property.<br\/><br\/>It is a fact, proved by the record, that the conjugal partnership formed between Dionisio Fulgencio, during his lifetime, and Benita Gatchalian and dissolved by the husband's death, owed several large debts and the testamentary executrix, in the fulfillment of her duty, has a right to claim the possession of all the property belonging to the estate of which she is the judicial administratrix, in order that, pursuant to law, she may make the required inventory and proceed, with the authorization of the court, to pay the debts duly presented to the commissioners of appraisal appointed in the special proceedings. It is an incontrovertible principle of law that, before proceeding with the division among the heirs, of the property left to them by the deceased, it is first necessary to settle the debts of said deceased predecessor in interest, without prejudice to the rights of the surviving widow, in relation to her own property which does not form a part of the conjugal partnership property nor is liable for the payment of the obligations existing against the conjugal partnership.<br\/><br\/>Evidence was introduced to prove that the widow, Benita Gatchalian, on contracting marriage with the now deceased Dionisio Fulgencio, brought to the conjugal partnership, property worth about twelve thousand pesos, being paraphernalia of the wife's exclusive ownership; but once included among the property of the conjugal partnership, a demand for its exclusion on the part of its legitimate owner could properly be made only after the formation of the inventory of the property that constitutes the estate of her deceased husband.<br\/><br\/>If the widow Benita Gatchalian now held the office of testamentary executrix, it would be her duty to make the inventory of the property belonging to the marriage dissolved by the death of her husband, and she would settle the claims which in any and all matters might be addressed to her against the intestate succession of her deceased husband; however, the duties of the office of testamentary executor being performed by another person, and there being debts of considerable amount to settle, the judicial administratrix is entitled to demand that she be placed in possession of the property that forms the assets of the intestate estate, in order that she may proceed to inventory the same and to pay the legitimate debts duly claimed in the special intestate proceedings, exception being made of and without prejudice to the rights of the widow with respect to her paraphernal property, which is not liable for the debts of the conjugal partnership.<br\/><br\/>At the beginning of the hearing of this case, the attorneys for both parties agreed that the following facts should be considered as proven:<br\/><blockquote> \"1.

ROXAS, OPPONENT AND APPELLANT.\n  <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"><p>This  appeal involves only a right of way claimed  by the appellant Pedro P. Roxas, the owner of the dominant  estate, across parcel L, the property of  the appellee, to Calle Tejeron, a distance of about 100 meters.   The  servient estate is bounded on  the north by an estero; on the west  by the dominant estate; on the southwest by Calle Tejeron; and on the west by lands of Francisco Managan.  The eastern line, which  joins the dominant estate, is 265 meters long.  The appellant claims a right of way starting across parcel L at a point 198 meters from the southern extremity of this line. During the trial of this case  in the court below the parties entered into the following agreement:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is admitted as a question of fact that the road between the Hacienda de San Pedro Macati and Calle Tejeron, which, according to the witness  Leopoldo Areopaguita, was formerly  a meter and a half or two meters wide,  although at present it has a greater width, has been used from time immemorial by the tenants of the Hacienda de San Pedro Macati for the passage of carts entering and leaving the Hacienda.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the admitted facts as above set forth, the testimony shows  that the road in question is now some  4 meters wide; that since time out of mind there has existed upon lot L near the middle,  and also very near this rpad, a small church; that the faithful use  said road in  going to this place of worship and that said road is not only used by the tenants of the appellant but also' by the people living in the <em>sitio<\/em> of Suavoy.<\/p>\n<p>It is  admitted  by both parties that the tenants of  the dominant estate have used the road in question since time immemorial for  carts, both  for  entering and leaving  the hacienda.  It is also an established fact that  the  said  hacienda  (the dominant estate)  is partly bounded on the south by Calle Tejeron.  The point where it js claimed that this right of way  starts across lot L is only 198.25  meters from the  said street.  So the claim of the appellant cannot be that the right of way exists by necessity growing out of the . peculiar location  of his property, but  simply that  it  arises by prescription, founded alone upon immemorial use by  his tenants.<\/p>\n<p>The result is that the road which the appellant  seeks to have declared a right of way for the benefit of his hacienda has been used for a great number of years by the members of the appellee's church to go to and from the ermita, and also by the appellant's tenants, and by other people.   And furthermore, while it is true that the appellant's  tenants have used this road for carts as above  stated, yet it has not been shown that such use was absolutely necessary in order to cultivate the dominant  estate,  but, on the  contrary, it clearly appears that the  said  tenants crossed lot L merely on account of convenience, as they could  have  reached the public highway by going in other directions, especially south, only 198 meters.   Therefore, the admitted and established facts show (1) that the use of the road by the tenants of the appellant in this manner and under these circumstances has not been such as to create an easement by prescription or in any other manner; and (2) that the use of said road by all has been by permission or tolerance of the appellee.<\/p>\n<p>Where a tract of land, as in the case at bar, attached to a public meeting house\u2014such as the <em>ermita<\/em>\u2014is designedly left open and uninclosed for the convenience of the members or worshippers of that church, the mere passage of persons over  it in common with those  for whose,  use it was  appropriated is to be regarded as permissive and under  an implied license, arid  not adverse.  Such  a use is not inconsistent with  the only use which the proprietor thought fit to make of the land, and until the appellee thinks proper to inclose it, such use is not adverse and will not preclude it from enclosing the land when other views  of its interests render it proper to do so.  And though an adjacent  proprietor may make such use of the open land more frequently than another, yet the same rule will apply  unless there  be some decisive act indicating a <em>separate <\/em>and exclusive use under a claim of right  A different doctrine would have a tendency to destroy all neighborhood accommodations in the way of travel; for  if it were once understood that a man, by allowing his neighbor to pass through his farm without objection over the pass-way which he  used  himself, would thereby, after the  lapse of time, confer  a right on such neighbor to require the pass-way to be kept open for his benefit and enjoyment, a prohibition against all such travel would  immediately ensue.  And again, it  must be remembered that a right of way, like the one sought to be established  in the  case at bar, is a charge  imposed upon real property for the benefit of another estate  belonging to a different owner.  Such a right of way is  a privilege or advantage in land existing distinct from the ownership of the soil; and because it is a permanent interest in  another's land with a right to enter at all times  and enjoy  it, it  can only be founded upon an  agreement or upon prescription. And when the latter is relied upon in those cases where the right of way is not essential for the beneficial enjoyment of the dominant estate, the proof showing adverse use\u2014which is an  affirmative claim\u2014must  be sufficiently strong and convincing to overcome the  presumption of permissive use or license,  as such a right  of way is never implied because it is convenient. For these reasons, the judgment appealed from denying the appellant's claim  to a right  of  way  across lot  L is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em> Carson, J.,<\/em> concurs.<\/p>\n<em>Johnson <\/em>and<em> Moreland,  JJ.,<\/em> concur in the result.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<div align=\"center\"><br\/>\n<em>CONCURRING<\/em><\/div>\n<p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think that the decision should be affirmed in so far as it  orders the registration of the land,  but  with  express recognition of the right of way or road across the land, to this extent reversing the portion overruling the objection.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Nowhere, in\u00a0 any part of his declaration,\u00a0 does\u00a0 he swear positively that Victor Dula and Isaac Gramonte came to his house and manacled Mariano Vicente and carried him away in the year 1898.\u00a0 The\u00a0 prosecuting attorney\u00a0 of the Province of Pampanga was constantly putting\u00a0 into the mouth of the witness the\u00a0 year 1898.\u00a0 It would be difficult to find a case where the rule, that leading questions\u00a0 should not be permitted, was more frequently violated than in the present case, in the examination of\u00a0 the witnesses for the prosecution by the prosecuting attorney.\u00a0 For example, we find the following questions, presented by the fiscal, which demonstrate how the prosecuting attorney\u00a0 was constantly leading the witness\u00a0 with\u00a0 reference to\u00a0 the\u00a0 time\u00a0 when the crime was committed:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Fiscal. Do you remember in one\u00a0 of\u00a0 the months\u00a0 of the year 1898 to have seen a certain Mariano Vicente?\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Fiscal. At\u00a0 that time, that is, in the\u00a0 year 1898, do you know in what barrio Mariano Vicente lived?\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Fiscal. Do you\u00a0 know\u00a0 where Mariano Vicente's house was in the year 1898?\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Fiscal. In what way were you acquainted with Mariano. Vicente back there in the year 1898 when that affair happened?\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Nowhere, from one end of the declaration to the other of the witness Hermogenes Gramonte, does he state, except as the words are put into his mouth, that the crime was committed in the year 1898.<\/p><p>Another illustration showing how the prosecuting attorney violated the rule that leading questions are not permissible is as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Fiscal. What are\u00a0 the names of those two persons who went into your house at the time when Mariano Vicente also was there?\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Prior\u00a0 to this question there had been no\u00a0 intimation by question or answer or otherwise that two persons\u00a0 or any other number of persons had entered the house of Hermogenes Gramonte on the occasion when Mariano Vicente was manacled and carried away.\u00a0\u00a0 The prosecuting attorney did not seem willing to allow the witnesses\u00a0 to relate\u00a0 the facts as they occurred, nor did he seem to have patience to wait until the witnesses could recall the facts and relate them as they occurred.\u00a0 He seemed to be anxious\u00a0 constantly to lead\u00a0 the witnesses and to place in their mouths the facts which\u00a0 he desired to have appear of record.\u00a0\u00a0 As\u00a0 was said above,\u00a0 it would be difficult to find a case where the witness was more directly led into giving declarations such as the prosecuting attorney\u00a0 desired him to make\u00a0 than\u00a0 in\u00a0 the present case.<\/p><p>It\u00a0 will\u00a0 be noted also that the errors\u00a0 committed\u00a0 by\u00a0 the use of leading and direct\u00a0 questions on the part\u00a0 of\u00a0 the prosecuting attorney were but little corrected on behalf of the attorney for the defense.\u00a0\u00a0 He seems\u00a0 to have fallen into exactly the same error.\u00a0 It will be impossible for the courts to arrive at the real facts in any case and to be able to do justice if leading questions such as were permitted in\u00a0 the present case shall be tolerated.<\/p><p>We find in the declaration of Esteban de los Santos, the second witness called for the prosecution, that practically the same errors were committed.\u00a0 The prosecuting attorney here again is constantly placing in the mouth of the witness the fact that the crime was committed in\u00a0 the year\u00a0 1898, without giving the\u00a0 witness, who claims\u00a0 to have been an eyewitness\u00a0 of the acts complained\u00a0 of, an\u00a0 opportunity to relate the facts as he saw them and as he remembered them. The prosecuting attorney did not give this witness (Esteban de los Santos) an opportunity to relate what he saw and give the place and time of the occurrence of what he saw, but insisted upon putting into the witness's mouth the year 1898. We have the following questions which illustrate this\u00a0 fact:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Fiscal. Do you remember in what barrio you were living in the year 1898?\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Fiscal. Do you remember in that year 1898, in one of the months thereof, to have seen a certain Mariano Vicente in some part of that barrio Malabu ?\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In no part of the declaration of this\u00a0 witness does\u00a0 he declare that Mariano Vicente was killed in\u00a0 the year 1898, except\u00a0 as that year is\u00a0 placed\u00a0 in\u00a0 his\u00a0 mouth by leading questions.\u00a0\u00a0 Finally and after the witness had stated positively that Mariano Vicente\u00a0 had been\u00a0 killed by the defendants and\u00a0 others in the year 1898, by\u00a0 reason of the prosecuting\u00a0 attorney having placed in his mouth the year 1898, <em>the said prosecuting attorney asked\u00a0 him the question directly if he\u00a0 remembered the year in which occurred the facts which\u00a0 he had referred to and\u00a0 the witness said: <\/em>\"I've forgotten because a long time has now elapsed.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Record, p. 42.)\u00a0 Which answer clearly indicates that he was unconsciously swearing to\u00a0 the fact that the crime was committed in the year\u00a0 1898.\u00a0 Moreover, except for the admissions of the defendant and his\u00a0 witnessses, we find no proof in the record showing that Mariano Vicente was killed at all.\u00a0 The only proof adduced by the prosecuting attorney relating to the charges\u00a0 contained in the complaint in\u00a0 effect is the fact that some time the defendant, Victor Dula, and Isaac\u00a0 Gramonte came to the house of Hermogenes\u00a0 Gramonte where Mariano Vicente\u00a0 was and manacled him\u00a0 and\u00a0 carried him away\u00a0 and that thereafter\u00a0 Vicente\u00a0 had never been seen.<\/p><p>The defendant himself and\u00a0 his witnesses admit that Mariano Vicente was manacled and carried away and killed; they attempt to\u00a0 prove that\u00a0 the murder took place in the year 1899; they attempt to show that Mariano Vicente was a spy; that he was constantly reporting, to the enemies of the\u00a0 revolutionists, facts which they claimed to be\u00a0 to their prejudice and that the chief of the insurrectos ordered that Mariano\u00a0 Vicente\u00a0 be\u00a0 killed for\u00a0 the\u00a0 reason\u00a0 that he was a spy.<\/p><p>We believe that no one can read the record in the present case without being convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that whether or not Mariano Vicente was a spy, he was killed by the defendant and others for the reason that the latter believed that he was\u00a0 a spy.\u00a0 Hermogenes\u00a0 Gramonte,\u00a0 the leading witness for the prosecution, admitted that Mariano Vicente had no profession;\u00a0 that he did not know where Mariano Vicente lived; that he was found at different times in different parts\u00a0 of the province, without apparently any means of support whatever during the time of the revolution.\u00a0 The witness Esteban de\" los Santos also testified that while he knew Mariano Vicente, he did not\u00a0 know what his occupation was at that time.<\/p><p>It seems clear, from a careful examination of the record, that Mariano Vicente was killed as the result of an internal political\u00a0 feud or.\u00a0 dissension\u00a0 existing among the Filipino people themselves, growing out of an insurrection which existed in the Philippine Islands during the years 1898 and 1899, and that, therefore, the defendant is\u00a0 entitled to the benefit of the Amnesty Proclamation issued by Theodore Roosevelt, then President of the United States, on\u00a0 the 4th of July, 1902.<\/p><p>The sentence of the lower court is therefore hereby\u00a0 reversed, the complaint against the defendant is hereby\u00a0 ordered dismissed and the defendant is hereby discharged from the custody of the law, with costs <em>de oficio<\/em>.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em> Mapa, Carson <\/em>and <em>Trent, JJ<\/em>., concur.<br\/><em>Arellano, C.

satisfaction of the judgment, was a lot belonging to Jose Lim, situated on Concepcion street of the municipality\u00a0 of Iloilo, containing an area of 2,534.24 square meters and bounded\u00a0 on the north, west, and south by a\u00a0 lot owned hy Dona Valeria Ledesma, and on the east by a lot belonging to\u00a0 Don Vicente Gay.<p>A portion\u00a0 of this lot of\u00a0 Jose Lim, to wit, 449.30 square meters toward the west, or in the part bordering on the lot of Dona Valeria Ledesma,\u00a0 is at present the subject matter of litigation.<\/p><p>Jose\u00a0 Lim's entire\u00a0 lot,\u00a0 having the aforesaid\u00a0 area\u00a0 of 2,534.24 square\u00a0 meters, levied\u00a0 upon\u00a0 as stated pursuant to the writ of execution\u00a0 issued, was\u00a0 by\u00a0 Jose Lim himself sold to Angel Javellana, on October\u00a0 26, 1908, at a price equal to the total amount of the judgment.\u00a0\u00a0 The sale\u00a0 was effected through an instrument executed for the purpose, attested by a notary and recorded in the property registry of Iloilo on May 5, 1910.<\/p><p>It appears, as shown by an instrument also attested\u00a0 by a\u00a0 notary, that Jose Lim had,\u00a0 on June 23, 1905, sold the portion of land aforementioned, the 449 square meters and 30 square centimeters, to Domiciano\u00a0 Gonzaga for the price of P650, in currency, and that this instrument was likewise recorded in the property registry of Iloilo, on December 15, 1909.<\/p><p>Through\u00a0 another instrument of the same\u00a0 date, it was agreed by the vendor and the vendee that Gonzaga would not require a house of light material which stood on the land and belonged\u00a0 to Lim to be removed therefrom\u00a0 for a period of twenty years or until it should fall down through some accident, and that, in compensation, Lim\u00a0 would pay the land tax levied against the said lot.<\/p><p>On May 21, 1910, Gonzaga brought suit against Angel Javellana for the ownership of the said parcel of land consisting of the 449 square meters and 30 square centimeters, the identification of\u00a0 which is a fact agreed\u00a0 upon at the trial, requested that he be declared the owner thereof and that the defendant\u00a0 be compelled to recognize the said parcel to be of the plaintiff's\u00a0 exclusive and legitimate owner- ship,\u00a0 and that the\u00a0 latter be placed in possession thereof.<\/p><p>The defendant, after denying all the facts set forth in the complaint, impugned the purchase alleged by the plaintiff and claimed that it was fictitious.<\/p><p>The Court of First Instance of Iloilo decided\u00a0 the suit in behalf of the plaintiff.\u00a0 The defendant appealed from that judgment and forwarded his appeal to this court through the means of a bill of exceptions.<\/p><p>An examination of the appeal\u00a0 and the allegations therein made by the appellant discloses\u00a0 that the latter claims that the trial court erred: (1) Because it was not held that the sale made by Jose Lim to Domiciano Gonzaga was a simulated\u00a0 one; (2)\u00a0 because it was\u00a0 decided\u00a0 that the plaintiff's right had preference over\u00a0 the defendant's, with regard to the land in question; and (3) because the suit was decided in the\u00a0 plaintiff's favor.<\/p><p>As concerns the first assignment of error,\u00a0 the appellant insists that\u00a0 the sale made to the plaintiff was a simulated one: (1)\u00a0 Because it was averred to be such by the witness, Eugenio D.\u00a0 Gonzaga, who testified that he was\u00a0 present at the execution of the sale and, notwithstanding, knew, as he was so told\u00a0 by the vendor\u00a0 himself, Lim, that nothing was paid because, according to\u00a0 a statement made by the latter\u00a0 the next day, the sale was fictitious;\u00a0 (2) because, as testified by Donato Lim, a witness for the plaintiff, it was agreed between the vendor and the vendee that the former should apply for a Torrens\u00a0 ownership title\u00a0 for all the land, and it appears that the application signed\u00a0 by\u00a0 Jose Lim bears the date of May 28, 1905, twenty-five days prior to that of the contract of sale, which\u00a0 is dated June 23, 1905; (3) because in April, 1908, Jose Lim had the disposal of all the land\u00a0 and executed a lease of the entire tract; (4) because Jose Lim, three days\u00a0 prior to his death, caused to be delivered\u00a0 to the defendant all the documents pertaining to the land; (5) because the defendant raised no\u00a0 objection at the time\u00a0 the land was attached by virtue of the writ of execution issued; and, finally, because it was not the plaintiff, but Jose Lim himself, who signed\u00a0 the\u00a0 declaration for the purposes of the land tax.<\/p><p>The first\u00a0 assignment of error was duly considered by the trial judge\u00a0 and his finding in the matter must stand, as it is not erroneous.\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"There is no doubt - he says - that the deed made in 1905 by Jose Lim to this plaintiff was made\u00a0 for a valuable consideration.\u00a0 This is shown by the deed itself, and the testimony of Donato Lim shows that\u00a0 the consideration was actually paid,\u00a0 and his testimony is much more reliable and better testimony than that of Eugenio Gonzaga, who says there was no consideration to the deed.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>In another part of the judgment he says:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"There is no question about the signatures of Lopez Vito and Yamson;\u00a0 all of the witnesses swear to .their genuineness - even the witness put upon the stand to testify for the defendant that Jose\u00a0 Lim's signature\u00a0 was\u00a0 not genuine\u00a0 on the contract (the private one).\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>We find corroboration of the conclusions of the lower court in the testimony of the notary who\u00a0 legalized the plaintiff's deed of purchase, who attested at the trial his own signature and those of the witnesses to the instrument, the attorneys Manuel\u00a0 Fernandez Yamson\u00a0 and\u00a0 Jose Lopez Vito,\u00a0 and averred that the maker of the deed was the first mentioned of these attorneys, who afterwards read it to Jose Lim who stated that he agreed to its contents.\u00a0 This proceeding was had in\u00a0 the office of the newspaper \"El\u00a0 Tiempo.\"<\/p><p>It is\u00a0 not, however, to\u00a0 be\u00a0 concluded that\u00a0 proof of\u00a0 the genuineness of a document is\u00a0 likewise proof of the truth of its contents, for the instrument might very well be clothed with all the external legal forms and\u00a0 formalities and yet in itself attest a simulated contract.\u00a0 What the trial court virtually concludes is that when the instrument itself states the consideration of the contract, and the witnesses thereto, including the\u00a0 notary who attested the authentication of the contract, affirm\u00a0 the contents of the same, such documentary proof cannot\u00a0 be destroyed simply by the statement of one witness who denies, in support of the\u00a0 charge made in\u00a0 the complaint that such contract\u00a0 is simulated, the existence of a\u00a0 consideration, that is, the\u00a0 truth of the payment of the price of the sale.<\/p><p>The other facts alleged as proof\u00a0 of the simulation\u00a0 do not, either singly or jointly, destroy the truth of the first contract of sale.<\/p><p>If, according\u00a0 to the clerk in charge of\u00a0 the\u00a0 record books of the\u00a0 property registry of\u00a0 Iloilo,\u00a0 the application for a Torrens title presented by Jose Lim, appears of record only as of November 18, 1905, the circumstance of this application's bearing a date anterior to that\u00a0 of the\u00a0 sale does not destroy the testimony of the\u00a0 witness Donato Lim that it was agreed upon between\u00a0 the vendee and\u00a0 the vendor that the latter should procure a Torrens\u00a0 title for all of the land, for what this witness perhaps meant was not proved,\u00a0 to wit,\u00a0 that it was\u00a0 useless to agree, on June\u00a0 23, 1905, to do a thing which was already done\u00a0 or was supposed to have been done on the 28th of the preceding month of May.<\/p><p>If it\u00a0 was agreed between\u00a0 Lim\u00a0 and Gonzaga\u00a0 that the former\u00a0 should continue paying\u00a0 the\u00a0 land tax,\u00a0 its\u00a0 payment for the\u00a0 entire\u00a0 lot argues nothing against the sale of a part of the lot.<\/p><p>If, in accordance with the contract,\u00a0 the\u00a0 vendor might continue to have a house on the lot, and a building, belonging to the other purchaser, extending in its main part to and covering the greater portion of the lot, it can not be concluded that\u00a0 the lease made,\u00a0 as late as 1908,\u00a0 of\u00a0 the building and of the entire lot, is an argument against the truth of the purchase of a parcel of the lot, considering the adhesion of a building to the ground it occupies.<\/p><p>The delivery made by the vendor, three days before his death, of all the papers concerning the lot\u00a0 to the second purchaser, does not make\u00a0 the conclusion inevitable\u00a0 that there could not\u00a0 have been a sale of a part of the lot to a previous purchaser.<\/p><p>And the sale\u00a0 of the entire\u00a0 lot having been made to the second purchaser on the 26th of October, 1908, when it was scarcely the 2d\u00a0 of the same month that\u00a0 it had been levied upon,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the\u00a0 record not disclosing\u00a0 whether\u00a0 publicity was given to this judicial proceeding so\u00a0 that the first\u00a0 purchaser, a resident\u00a0 of and usually in\u00a0 Negros at the time, might have cognizance thereof, the passiveness and inaction of that first purchaser against whom no proof was presented to show that he knew of the\u00a0 second sale of the entire lot, are not an argument disproving the\u00a0 sale previously made of a part of the said lot.<\/p><p>As there was\u00a0 not sufficient evidence of the simulation of the contract of\u00a0 sale on which the complaint is based,\u00a0 the court rightly concluded that the sale was a true, valid and effective one.<\/p><p>It appears that the parcel of land concerned in this suit was sold twice to different purchasers: to the plaintiff, on June 23, 1905, and the sale was inscribed in the\u00a0 property registry on\u00a0 December 15, 1909; and\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant, on October 26,\u00a0 1908, and this sale was likewise entered in the said registry on May 5, 1910.<\/p><p>The appellant argues that\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment rendered\u00a0 is erroneous because the court gave\u00a0 preference to\u00a0 the right claimed by the appellee, the first purchaser,\u00a0 instead of to that still maintained,\u00a0 in this appeal,\u00a0 by the second purchaser.\u00a0\u00a0 The grounds of this second assignment of error are that delivery of the thing sold had not been made to the first purchaser\u00a0 and the latter had not entered into the possession thereof.<\/p><p>The second paragraph of article 1462 of the Civil Code provides that when the sale is made by means of a public instrument,\u00a0 the execution thereof shall be equivalent to the delivery of the thing which is the subject of the contract, if from said instrument the contrary does not appear or may be clearlv inferred.\u00a0\u00a0 Pursuant to this provision, delivery of\u00a0 the\u00a0 thing sold was made to\u00a0 both purchasers,\u00a0 the litigants in\u00a0 this suit, through the means of the execution of the\u00a0 respective public instruments of\u00a0 sale produced in evidence by each party.<\/p><p>As regards possession, the\u00a0 vendor\u00a0 explicitly declared in the first instrument of sale that \"he renounced in behalf of Domiciano Gonzaga, his heirs and successors-in-interest the right of property, possession, ownership and easements of the said\u00a0 lot\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *,\" and in the\u00a0 second instrument, in favor of Angel Javellana, that if, on the 24th of October, 1908, the price of the sale with right of repurchase had not been returned, such sale should be irrevocably consummated and the purchaser\u00a0 should be the absolute owner of the lot sold.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 evident that possession was legally conveyed to the first purchaser on\u00a0 June 23, 1905,\u00a0 and to the second, on October 24, 1908; but actual possession, as proven at the trial, was taken only by the\u00a0 second purchaser, who holds the lot in question at the present time.<\/p><p>The rules of preference provided by the Civil Code for deciding between the claims of different purchasers of one and the same thing, when it\u00a0 is a real\u00a0 property, are: that it shall belong to the person acquiring it who first recorded it in the registry; second, should there be no entry, it shall belong to the person who\u00a0 first took possession; and third, in the\u00a0 absence\u00a0 thereof, to the person who presents\u00a0 the oldest title,\u00a0 provided there is good faith.\u00a0 (Art. 1473, pars. 2 and 3.)<\/p><p>In\u00a0 the judgment, good faith is supposed on the part of both purchasers, and\u00a0 it is not argued in this appeal that either of them showed bad faith.<\/p><p>The first purchaser, therefore, has\u00a0 in\u00a0 his favor priority of title and priority of entry in the property registry; and it is this priority of registration that is the positive reason for deciding on this appeal that - <\/p><blockquote><p>\"If\u00a0 the\u00a0 thing be real property, ownership\u00a0 thereof shall belong to the person acquiring it who first recorded it in the registry.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Therefore, as the judgment appealed\u00a0 from is in accord with this legal provision and the merits of the proceedings, the same is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p><p><em> Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

In obedience to this\u00a0 order the policemen Felix Cambonga, Cesareo Ordeliza, and Fau'sto Oatisan, together with their corporal, Cesareo Padayao, started to discharge their\u00a0 duty at 3\u00a0 o'clock\u00a0 in the\u00a0 afternoon of that same day, and, at about\u00a0 7 o'clock in the evening, went in front\u00a0 of the house of Santiago, Feliciano,\u00a0 and\u00a0 Ciriaco Ginosolongo.\u00a0 After wishing them good-evening, the officers stated to them the purpose\u00a0 of their presence there, whereupon\u00a0 they\u00a0 were invited by\u00a0 the owners of the\u00a0 house\u00a0 to come inside.\u00a0 Only the corporal, Cesareo Padayao, provided solely with a small whip,\u00a0 accordingly entered the house,\u00a0 the three other policemen,\u00a0 who carried bladed\u00a0 weapons, remaining in the yard below.\u00a0 When the corporal Padayao, asked the said men for their\u00a0 <em>cedulas<\/em> or registration certificates, one of\u00a0 them replied that he would show them to him at once, offering him at the same time a cigar, and while they were getting the <em>cedulas<\/em> from some place in the house, Santiago Ginosolongo put out the light and with a <em>pinuti<\/em>, a long pointed bolo,\u00a0 pierced\u00a0 corporal\u00a0 Padayao through\u00a0 the\u00a0 body, the weapon entering below the left armpit and the point of the blade coming out at the right side; thereupon the wounded man shrieked and called to the other policemen for help and rushed precipitately toward the yard, but on the stairs he was wounded again by another blow on the right leg.\u00a0 At the first shriek of the victim, the three policemen who\u00a0 were in the yard below responded, but were met by the defendants who were also coming down the stairs in pursuit of the corporal, and then a\u00a0 struggle ensued between the former and the policeman, Felix\u00a0 Cambonga, the\u00a0 only one\u00a0 of the officers who made resistance, for the\u00a0 other two policemen, his companions, took\u00a0 to flight.\u00a0 As\u00a0 a result of the fight, Antonio Ginosolongo, the\u00a0 defendants' father,\u00a0 and Petra Ginosolongo, their sister, were killed\u00a0 in the yard, and the policeman, Cambonga, received three wounds, inflicted by the said Santiago Ginosolongo, in the forehead, in the left side and in the chest or waist.<\/p><p>The aforesaid facts were brought\u00a0 to the notice\u00a0 of the justice of the peace court of Dumanjug, on October 21,1904, by Corporal Padayao's widow, and, a preliminary investigation having been made on August 28, 1911, a complaint was accordingly filed\u00a0 by the provincial fiscal in the Court of First\u00a0 Instance of Cebu, charging the said\u00a0 Santiago,\u00a0 Feliciano, and Ciriaco Ginosolongo with the crime of homicide, and this case having been instituted, the court,\u00a0 after due consideration of the evidence, rendered judgment on November\u00a0 7, 1911, sentencing each\u00a0 of the defendants to the penalty of twelve years and one day of <em>reclusion temporal<\/em> and to pay one-third of the costs.\u00a0 From this judgment, the defendants appealed.<\/p><p>From the facts aforerelated, duly proven in this case, it appears that,\u00a0 in the\u00a0 evening\u00a0 of\u00a0 October 19, 1904, on an occasion when four policemen, complying with their duties as agents of the authorities, were carrying out an\u00a0 order from the municipal president of Dumanjug, and as soon as their corporal, Cesareo Padayao, entered the house, upon the invitation\u00a0 of some one of its inmates, to which\u00a0 latter he announced the object of his visit, he was offered a cigar to smoke, the said inmates agreeing to show him the cedulas which he desired to see; that thereupon, without warning, Padayao was assaulted by Santiago Ginosolongo who stabbed him with a long, pointed bolo which pierced him through the body, the weapon entering below the left armpit and its point coming out at the right side; that, when the wounded man was running down from the house to the yard below, he was still pursued\u00a0 by his assailant,\u00a0 who\u00a0 inflicted upon him two other wounds as a result of which he immediately fell at full\u00a0 length\u00a0 and died at a place about. 10 meters distant from the house; that as the policeman, Felix Cambonga, at the shrieks of the unfortunate assaulted corporal, approached to\u00a0 render aid, he was also set upon by Santiago Ginosolongo, who inflicted upon him three serious wounds, and, as a\u00a0 consequence of\u00a0 the struggle\u00a0 between Cambonga and the defendant just above mentioned, the latter's father and sister, Antonio and Petra Ginosolongo, were also killed, they having approached the said\u00a0 combatants, and whether they came near the latter to separate them or to take a hand in the fight by assisting their son and brother, is a fact not satisfactorily shown by the record.<\/p><p>The acts committed by Santiago Ginosolongo, besides constituting\u00a0 unlawful resistance to agents of the authorities while they were performing the duties\u00a0 of their office, are characteristic of the crime of murder, perpetrated against the corporal, Padayao, on account of\u00a0 the\u00a0 roughness and suddenness of the attack made by the aggressor at a moment when the assaulted party\u00a0 was unsuspicious of danger and unarmed\u00a0 and was\u00a0 waiting to be shown the <em>cedulas<\/em> which he had\u00a0 demanded, far from suspecting that he was to be assaulted in that manner after he had been invited to enter the house\u00a0 and\u00a0 had\u00a0 been accorded a\u00a0 friendly\u00a0 reception therein.\u00a0 JJut, as the complaint only charges the accused with the crime of homicide, it would not be lawful to convict them of the more serious crime of murder, and,\u00a0 therefore, this case must be decided in accordance with the classification\u00a0 made of the crime under prosecution.<\/p><p>The crime of homicide is provided for and punished by article 404 of the Penal\u00a0 Code; and it is\u00a0 an unquestionable fact that the police corporal, Cesareo Padayao, met a violent death at the hands of his assailant, Santiago Ginosolongo, and,\u00a0 therefore,\u00a0 it is beyond peradventure that this defendant is the sole proved perpetrator by direct participation confessed and convicted of the said crime, classified in the complaint as simple\u00a0 homicide, instead\u00a0 of murder,\u00a0 as\u00a0 it should have been, since it was committed with treachery.<\/p><p>In view of the fact that in the complaint itself the crime of attempt\u00a0 against the\u00a0 agents of the\u00a0 authorities,\u00a0 is not charged, this crime may not, lawfully, be considered in this decision, which must deal exclusively with that of homicide.<\/p><p>With\u00a0 respect to the allegation made by Santiago Ginosolongo, that,\u00a0 in attacking\u00a0 Corporal Padayao,\u00a0 he acted in his own\u00a0 defense and in that of his father and sister, the\u00a0 record of this case does not show that the four policemen went into the defendant's house, nor that they committed any abuse or insult against the inmates thereof.\u00a0 Neither is there proof that\u00a0 when this defendant, Santiago, assaulted Padayao and pierced him\u00a0 through the body with a deadly weapon, he himself had previously been\u00a0 attacked, and his father, Antonio Ginosolongo, was already wounded; for the appellant's own brothers, Feliciano and Ciriaco, not only did not corroborate his unfounded allegation,\u00a0 but testified differently and contradicted him.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the facts were perfectly proven that the corporal, Padayao, was the only one\u00a0 of the\u00a0 officers who\u00a0 entered the house;\u00a0 that, after he had been seriously wounded and when he was leaving it, yelling for help, he was still being pursued by his assailant, Santiago Ginosolongo, for the latter succeeded in inflicting upon him two other wounds, one\u00a0 in the leg, while Padayao was still on the stairs in the act of leaving the house, and the other, in the yard below; that the struggle between this defendant and the policeman, Felix Cambonga, the only person\u00a0 who attempted to aid the corporal, took place in the yard, when Padayao was\u00a0 already lying\u00a0 stretched out on\u00a0 the ground dying, on which occasion Felix also received three wounds from the said\u00a0 Santiago, and so it is true that the struggle did not take place in the upper part of the house, but in the yard below, that\u00a0 the assailant's father\u00a0 and sister\u00a0 were killed in the yard\u00a0 and\u00a0 not\u00a0 inside the house, upon\u00a0 their approaching the combatants, Santiago and Felix, for when Padayao,\u00a0 the assaulted party, ran below,\u00a0 pursued\u00a0 by the former, all\u00a0 of\u00a0 Santiago's family came out of the house; therefore, there are\u00a0 absolutely\u00a0 no\u00a0 grounds\u00a0 whatever to support the defense maintained\u00a0 by this defendant, to the effect that there was a\u00a0 prior assault on the part of the policemen, against his said father and sister.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding that\u00a0 Felix Cambonga testified that the other defendants,\u00a0 Ciriaco and Feliciano Ginosolongo,\u00a0 also took part in the assault made upon him, by throwing stones at\u00a0 him\u00a0 from\u00a0 a distance, while he\u00a0 was\u00a0 struggling\u00a0 and defending himself against their brother, Santiago Ginosolongo, yet this statement\u00a0 does not appear to be corroborated by\u00a0 any other\u00a0 evidence,\u00a0 even\u00a0 circumstantial, tending to prove their guilt beyond\u00a0 all reasonable doubt; therefore, in the absence of proof that they actually\u00a0 participated in the crime of homicide\u00a0 under prosecution, and though we deem their innocence doubtful,\u00a0 they must be acquitted.<\/p><p>In the commission of this crime of homicide, no consideration\u00a0 is to be had\u00a0 of the attendance\u00a0 of the special circumstance specified in article 11 of the Penal Code, for the reason that it does not\u00a0 appear\u00a0 to have been proved that the defendant, Santiago, was entirely uneducated, though unusual perversity is noticeable\u00a0 in his conduct, since he\u00a0\u00a0 assaulted, suddenly, unexpectedly and without provocation, an agent of the authorities who was complying with his duties, after the defendant had\u00a0 promised to exhibit his eedula and had inspired confidence in the officer by inviting him to come into the house, and offering him a cigar.\u00a0 On the other hand, account ought to be taken of the concurrence of the circumstance of treachery attending the commission of the criminal act, for the reason that when this circumstance qualifies the crime of homicide the latter is thereby converted into murder.\u00a0 However, since only the crime of homicide was charged in the complaint and the case was prosecuted and decided in accordance with that charge, it is not permissible nor\u00a0 would it be lawful to try and convict the accused for the crime\u00a0 of\u00a0 murder,\u00a0 yet\u00a0 strict justice requires that the element of treachery which attended the commission of the crime charged, must be taken into account in the present case, as\u00a0 a mere aggravating circumstance.<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to\u00a0 the judgment appealed from are deemed\u00a0 to have been refuted, we are\u00a0 of the opinion\u00a0 that we should,\u00a0 as we do hereby, sentence Santiago\u00a0 Ginosolongo to the penalty of seventeen years four months and one day\u00a0 of <em>reclusion temporal,<\/em> to the accessories provided by article 59, to indemnify the widow and heirs\u00a0 of Cesareo Padayao in the sum of P1,000, and to pay one-third of the costs of both instances; and, further, that we should, as\u00a0 we do hereby, acquit Feliciano and Ciriaco Ginosolongo, with two-thirds of the costs of both instances de oficio, thus affirming the judgment appealed from in so far\u00a0 as it is in agreement herewith\u00a0 and reversing it in so far as it is not.\u00a0\u00a0 Let an order be issued to the Director of Prisons for the immediate release of the two last-mentioned defendants, if they are not held on any other charge.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

The only question in this case which it is necessary for us to determine is\u00a0 whether\u00a0 or not the respondent\u00a0 judge had jurisdiction, under the provisions of section 27 of the Election Law, as amended by Act No.\u00a0 2170, to\u00a0 declare that no one was legally elected president of Imus on June 4, 1912. In other words, have the Courts\u00a0 of First\u00a0 Instance jurisdiction, under the above provisions of law, to determine the eligibility\u00a0 of candidates for office? It\u00a0 is admitted by all that the contest\u00a0 under\u00a0 consideration was instituted in the Court of First Instance of Cavite under those provisions and that the\u00a0 only\u00a0 question raised\u00a0 or\u00a0 which could have\u00a0 been raised by the pleadings in the proceedings in the court below was whether or not\u00a0 Topacio was eligible to be elected and to\u00a0 hold the office of municipal president.\u00a0 Section 27 of Act No. 1582 as\u00a0 originally enacted\u00a0 reads:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Sec. 27. <em>Election contests.<\/em> - The Assembly shall be the judge of\u00a0 the\u00a0 elections, returns, and\u00a0 qualifications of its members.\u00a0 Contests\u00a0 in\u00a0 all elections for the determination of which\u00a0 provision has not\u00a0 been made otherwise shall be heard by the Court\u00a0 of\u00a0 First Instance having\u00a0 jurisdiction in the judicial district in which the election\u00a0 was held, upon motion by any\u00a0 candidate voted for at\u00a0 such\u00a0 election, which motion must be made within two weeks after the election, and such\u00a0 court shall have exclusive and final jurisdiction and shall forthwith cause the registry lists\u00a0 and all ballots used at such election to be brought before it and examined, and to appoint the necessary officers therefor and to fix their compensation, which shall\u00a0 be payable in the first instance out of the provincial treasury,\u00a0 and to issue its mandamus\u00a0 directed to the boards of canvassers to correct its canvass in accordance with the facts\u00a0 as\u00a0 found.\u00a0\u00a0 If in any case the court\u00a0 shall determine that no person was lawfully elected it shall forthwith so certify to the Governor-General, who shall order a special election to fill the office or offices in question as hereinbefore provided.<\/p><p>\"Before the\u00a0 court shall entertain any such\u00a0 motion the party making it shall give a bond in an amount to be fixed by the court with two sureties satisfactory to it, conditioned that he\u00a0 will pay\u00a0 all expenses and costs incident to such motion, or shall deposit cash in court\u00a0 in lieu of such bond.

If\u00a0 in any case the\u00a0 court shall determine that no person was lawfully elected it shall forthwith so certify to the Governor-General who shall \"order a special election to fill the office or offices\u00a0 in\u00a0 question as hereinbefore provided: <em> Provided, however,<\/em>\u00a0 That\u00a0 an\u00a0 appeal\u00a0 may\u00a0 be taken to the Supreme\u00a0 Court,\u00a0 within ten days, from any final decision rendered by\u00a0 the Court of\u00a0 First Instance on contests of elections for provincial governors, for the review, amendment, repeal, or confirmation of such decision, and the procedure thereon shall be the same as in\u00a0 a criminal cause.<\/p><p>\"Before the court shall entertain any\u00a0 such motion or admit an appeal, the\u00a0 party making the motion or\u00a0 filing the appeal shall give bond in an amount fixed by the court with two sureties satisfactory to it, conditioned that he will pay all\u00a0 expenses\u00a0 and costs\u00a0 incident to such motion or appeal, or shall deposit cash in court in lieu of such bond.\u00a0 If the party paying such expenses and\u00a0 costs shall be successful they shall be taxed by the court and entered\u00a0 and be collectible as a judgment against the defeated party.<\/p><p>\"All proceedings under\u00a0 this section shall be upon motion with notice of not to exceed twenty days to all candidates voted for and not upon pleadings or by action, and shall be heard and determined by the court in the judicial district in which the election was\u00a0 held regardless\u00a0 of whether\u00a0 said\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 court be at the time holding a\u00a0 regular or stated term.

In all other essential respects, the section remains the same. Consequently, if the courts did\u00a0 not have jurisdiction under the original section to determine, in election contests, the question of the eligibility\u00a0 or legal qualifications of candidates, the amendment does not confer upon them that jurisdictional power.\u00a0 The construction placed upon the original section by this court is perfectly applicable to the\u00a0 new.<\/p><p>The method provided in the above-quoted section for the determination of election contests is purely a statutory one. The proceedings are not\u00a0 ordinary suits.\u00a0\u00a0 The statute expressly declares that the \"proceedings\" shall not be \"upon pleadings or by\u00a0 action.\"\u00a0\u00a0 This statute was especially enacted to give the Courts of First Instance the power to try contested election cases and it defines the powers of the court and the rules of procedure\u00a0 in the trial thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 The statute prescribes a special mode of procedure and the\u00a0 court is compelled to conform\u00a0 to it. It provides a speedy\u00a0 remedy. It prescribes within what time the motion shall be\u00a0 filed and requires the court to decide the contest as speedily as possible,\u00a0 giving preference over all other cases, if practicable, and also defines to a great extent how the court shall reach its conclusions.\u00a0\u00a0 These facts clearly show that the\u00a0 court is made a special tribunal to try contested election cases.\u00a0 The jurisdiction of such tribunals,\u00a0 although courts of general jurisdiction in all other matters, is strictly confined within the provisions of the statute creating them for this purpose.<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The court can take no additional power from its general jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 In the exercise of such special powers it is precisely limited to those plainly delegated.\u00a0 Nothing is to be presumed which is not expressly given.\"\u00a0 (Sutherland, Stat.

Barry,\u00a0 24 Cal., 449.)<\/p><p>That the proceedings authorized by those provisions were intended by\u00a0 the legislature to be\u00a0 summary' in the highest degree cannot be doubted.\u00a0 The requirements that the hearing, as we have said, is to be had on motion and not upon pleadings or by action;\u00a0 that\u00a0 the motion must be\u00a0 made within\u00a0 a very\u00a0 limited time; that notice of the motion shall not\u00a0 exceed twenty days; and\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 court shall\u00a0 decide the\u00a0 contest as soon as possible, and issue its mandamus forthwith to the canvassers; all show the summary,\u00a0 expeditious, and\u00a0 informal character of the proceedings.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is a\u00a0 special authorization to the court to do\u00a0 certain things in a particular way, and it is not to be construed as conferring power to do anything not\u00a0 expressly\u00a0 authorized. The fact that the person selected to inquire into such contests happens to be a judge is a mere incident, and does not authorize the inference that the power possessed with reference to\u00a0 <em>actions<\/em>\u00a0 is possessed with respect to these proceedings,\u00a0 which are\u00a0 expressly declared\u00a0 not to\u00a0 be actions.

As a legal proposition, this is not true.\u00a0 The provisions of law on this point and those giving the Governor-General power to remove ineligible provincial and municipal officers who are holding office are as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"*\u00a0 *\u00a0 * The Governor-General may refuse to confirm the\u00a0 election of\u00a0 any elective provincial officer if there is reasonable ground to suspect his loyalty to the constituted authorities, or if there is,\u00a0 in the opinion of the Governor-General, reasonable\u00a0 ground to believe that such person is morally unfit to\u00a0 hold public office, or in case, in the opinion of the Governor-General, such person has a bad reputation for morality, honesty, and uprightness in the community in which he\u00a0 lives.\u00a0 In\u00a0 case of refusal to confirm the election of\u00a0 any provincial officer the Governor-General, with the advice and consent of the Philippine Commission,\u00a0 may appoint a\u00a0 suitable person to fill the vacancy for the full term and until\u00a0 the election and qualification of a successor or, in his discretion, may call a special election to fill the\u00a0 office as provided in section four hereof, and at such special election a person whose confirmation was so refused shall be ineligible and no vote shall be counted or canvassed for him.

No construction is required to reach this result.\u00a0\u00a0 But the paragraph does have to be examined in order to ascertain the intent of the legislature as to <em>when<\/em> the power is to be exercised;\u00a0 that\u00a0 is, whether it is operative before or after the person assumes office.\u00a0\u00a0 To determine this question, the paragraph must be construed in connection\u00a0 with other provisions of the same act and subsequent legislation in <em>pari materia<\/em>.\u00a0 It cannot be segregated. If it stood alone,\u00a0 some difficulty would\u00a0 be encountered, as the word \"officer\" is not followed by the word \"elect\" as in paragraph eight.\u00a0\u00a0 This might be said to indicate that it was the intention of the legislature that the power should be exercised after the person had entered upon the duties of the office; that the oath of office is a condition precedent to the exercise of the power therein conferred. But when this paragraph is read in connection with paragraph eight\u00a0 of the same section, and section 2 of Act No. 1726, the intent is manifest.\u00a0 This latter section\u00a0 provides that the Governor-General, upon receipt of proof\u00a0 satisfactory to him, that an ineligible person <em>is holding any provincial or\u00a0 municipal office or employment<\/em>, he may summarily remove such person.\u00a0 That the\u00a0 Governor-General cannot exercise the\u00a0 power herein conferred until after the person has assumed office is specifically stated.\u00a0 He\u00a0 can\u00a0 only remove persons<em> holding <\/em>office.\u00a0 Here the entire field is covered and includes all provincial and municipal officers\u00a0 and employees. It can hardly be said that the legislature\u00a0 intended to invest the same power with reference to the removal of ineligible\u00a0 persons holding municipal\u00a0 offices\u00a0 in\u00a0 both the Governor-General\u00a0 and the municipal\u00a0 council.\u00a0 The\u00a0 legislature very wisely withheld\u00a0 from\u00a0 municipal\u00a0 councils the power to\u00a0 remove persons\u00a0 holding municipal\u00a0 offices and placed this power in\u00a0 the highest\u00a0 executive officer of the Government.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 therefore clear that the powers conferred upon municipal councils by paragraph nine of section 12\u00a0 (supra), cannot be exercised after the municipal officers enter upon their duties as such.\u00a0 The\u00a0 result\u00a0 is that there exists\u00a0 a complete administrative\u00a0 remedy\u00a0 for\u00a0 preventing ineligible provincial and municipal officers elect from entering upon the\u00a0 duties of such offices.\u00a0 A like remedy exists for the summary removal of such\u00a0 officers after they have taken charge.<\/p><p>Secondly, counsel\u00a0 for respondents argue\u00a0 that section 27 confers upon the Courts of First Instance the power to pass upon the eligibility of candidates for an elective office, in the exercise of the special powers thereby granted.<\/p><p>We premise that if the Courts of First Instance cannot finally and conclusively determine any election dispute under the powers granted them by section 27,\u00a0 such dispute cannot properly be considered justiciable under those powers at all, inasmuch as the legislature\u00a0 has expressly provided that all decisions of such tribunals in the exercise of\u00a0 these special powers shall be final and conclusive (with the\u00a0 exception, of course, in the case of\u00a0 provincial governors, that an appeal may be taken within ten days).\u00a0 The qualifications and disqualifications\u00a0 of elective provincial and municipal officers are set forth in the following provisions:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Provincial governors\u00a0 and\u00a0 third members of provincial boards must be at the\u00a0 time of the election qualified electors in the province;

or it may find that the manner of holding the\u00a0 election and the returns are so tainted with fraud or illegality that it cannot be\u00a0 determined who received\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a plurality of the legally cast ballots.\u00a0 In the latter case, no question as to the correctness of the returns or the manner of casting and\u00a0 counting\u00a0 the ballots is before the deciding power, and generally the\u00a0 only result can be that the election fails entirely.\u00a0 In the former, we have a contest in the strict sense of the word, because opposing parties are striving for supremacy.\u00a0 If it\u00a0 be found\u00a0 that the successful candidate (according to the board of canvassers) obtained a plurality in an\u00a0 illegal manner, and that another candidate was the <em>real victor<\/em>, the former must retire in favor of the latter. In the other case, there is not, strictly speaking, a contest, as the wreath of victory cannot be transferred\u00a0 from\u00a0 an ineligible candidate to any other candidate when the sole question is the eligibility\u00a0 of the one receiving a plurality of the legally cast ballots.\u00a0\u00a0 In the one case the question is as to who received a plurality of the legally cast ballots; in the other, the question\u00a0 is confined to the personal character and circumstances of a single individual.<\/p><p>Applying the familiar principle\u00a0 of <em>ejusdem generis<\/em>, we hold that jurisdiction under this section is limited to those matters\u00a0 which\u00a0 may be\u00a0 decided by an\u00a0 inspection of\u00a0 the registry list\u00a0 and\u00a0 of the\u00a0 ballots\u00a0 and\u00a0 their <em> res gestae<\/em>.

Rep., 468),\u00a0 Vicente Sotto received six hundred and fifty votes and Martin LIorente four hundred\u00a0 and eighty-three votes for municipal president\u00a0 of Cebu.\u00a0 Llorente protested\u00a0 the election upon the sole ground that\u00a0 Sotto\u00a0 was ineligible to be elected to the office of municipal president in that he was then under a sentence\u00a0 of four years and two months\u00a0 of <em>prision correccional<\/em>\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime of abduction.\u00a0 This was (by\u00a0 Sotto himself) a nonremovable disqualification which not\u00a0 only rendered him ineligible to be elected, but also\u00a0 ineligible to hold the office.\u00a0 The question squarely presented to the court below was\u00a0 whether or not it had the power, under section 27 of the Election Law to pass upon the eligibility of Sotto, who had received a\u00a0 plurality\u00a0 of\u00a0 the legally\u00a0 cast\u00a0 ballots, In disposing of the case, this court said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"In\u00a0 the\u00a0 present case the court below had nothing\u00a0 to decide\u00a0 in\u00a0 the matter of the scrutiny of the\u00a0 ballots, and nothing was\u00a0 asked for in the\u00a0 motion with respect to\u00a0 the operations showing the true and lawful result of the election\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for the office of\u00a0 municipal president qf Cebu; in proof thereof, the\u00a0 contending parties admit that the result of the scrutiny was\u00a0 lawful and correct; so that it is not a matter of rectifying the examination of the ballots so as to accord\u00a0 with the facts resulting from the proofs\u00a0 offered at the trial held by virtue\u00a0 of the protest, nor is it a case of a void election\u00a0 that should be referred to the Governor-General.<\/p><p>\"The whole of the question submitted to the court below is the status\u00a0 of the party\u00a0 who obtained the\u00a0 majority of votes, that is, whether the\u00a0 election of a person sentenced to four years of <em>prision correccional<\/em> should be confirmed or not, and by\u00a0 none of the sections of the Election Law is this question\u00a0 submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance.\" In a republican form of\u00a0 government, where a considerable number of\u00a0 the\u00a0 public servants\u00a0 received their appointments directly\u00a0 from the people\u00a0 in what\u00a0 are technically termed elections, it\u00a0 is only\u00a0 natural that controversies over who has thus been\u00a0 appointed to a\u00a0 particular\u00a0 office should arise with more\u00a0 frequency than\u00a0 they do in more centralized forms of government, and are more difficult to dispose of. Obviously,\u00a0 it is\u00a0 highly\u00a0 inexpedient\u00a0 and expensive to refer such question to the appointing power (the people),\u00a0 and they must, if possible, be decided by some more expeditious and economical\u00a0 method.\u00a0 To provide the means of\u00a0 disposing of these controversies\u00a0 quickly and cheaply,\u00a0 and in a way that will be reasonably certain to discover and\u00a0 declare the sacred will\u00a0 of the majority, is\u00a0 the task of legislators. In meeting these exacting requirements,\u00a0 the\u00a0 Philippine Legislature has\u00a0 covered the field by enacting appropriate legislation.\u00a0 It has\u00a0 established\u00a0 special tribunals with exclusive and final jurisdiction, by which the most vexatious controversies, those\u00a0 relating to\u00a0 the manner of casting\u00a0 and counting the ballots, may be expeditiously settled.\u00a0 It\u00a0 has provided for the\u00a0 further elimination of unnecessary\u00a0 and tiresome delays\u00a0 by\u00a0 clothing administrative\u00a0 officers of the\u00a0 government with power to remove for ineligibility candidates elect during the same\u00a0 interval of time.\u00a0 Confusion and uncertainty as to the results of an election are thus reduced to a minimum,\u00a0 and the return to political repose, so necessary to economic progress, is hastened.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The findings of the\u00a0 special tribunals above mentioned, acting within their jurisdictional powers, are final and conclusive.\u00a0 The returns of the canvassing board as corrected in accordance with the findings of these special tribunals are final and conclusive upon all\u00a0 departments of the government and upon all interested\u00a0 parties,<em> as to who received a plurality of\u00a0 the\u00a0 legally\u00a0 cast\u00a0 ballots. <\/em>\u00a0 But those administrative proceedings, authorized by law\u00a0 for the determination of the eligibility of candidates elect, while conclusive upon the administrative branch of the\u00a0 government, are not exclusive as to the\u00a0 courts.\u00a0 They do not abridge the right to the remedy of <em>quo warranto<\/em>.<\/p><p>For the foregoing reasons,\u00a0 we are of the opinion and so hold that the respondent judge exceeded his jurisdiction in declaring <em>in those proceedings<\/em> that no one was elect municipal president of the municipality of Imus at the last general election; and that said order and all subsequent proceedings based thereon\u00a0 are null\u00a0 and void\u00a0 and\u00a0 of\u00a0 no effect; and, although this decision is rendered on respondents' answer to the order to show cause, unless respondents raised some new and additional issues, let judgment be entered accordingly in 5 days, without costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano,\u00a0 C.\u00a0 J., Torres,\u00a0 Mapa, <\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ.<\/em>, concur.<\/p><\/div>",

This new evidence consists, substantially,  of a deposition of the master of the steamship <em>Kaloma <\/em>touching the destruction and loss of  her cargo as a result  of the sinking of the  ship in  the  harbor of Singapore for the purpose of extinguishing a dangerous fire which had broken out in the case-oil section of the cargo.<\/p>\n<p>Ruling upon  this motion was reserved  pending the submission of the  appeal, and  it  now becomes our duty  to determine its admissibility in the light of the facts developed by the whole record and the  argument of counsel upon the whole case.<\/p>\n<p>Upon a review of the whole record we are satisfied that if it be held  that a new  trial should not be granted for the purpose of admitting the above-mentioned deposition, then the judgment of the lower court must be affirmed; but that if a new trial should be granted, and this deposition is offered in evidence on  this new trial,  it is \"of such a character\" that in  all probability it would change the result.  If the deposition of the master of the Kaloma is to be believed, and there is nothing at present in the record to put it in doubt, the fire which broke out in her cargo at Singapore was not \"caused by the  design or neglect\" of the owners  or  of any of their employees, and the loss of the goods of the plaintiff which was occasioned thereby gave him no cause of action against the defendant,  in view of the express provisions  of the bill of lading, and of section 4282 of the Revised Statutes of the United States.<\/p>\n<p>The question  as to the right of the defendant to have a new trial on the ground that the  evidence in question is newly discovered presents some difficulty.   We recognize the difficulty which, in the ordinary course of events,  would be encountered in securing the testimony of the responsible officers of an ocean-going ship as to tfre facts and circumstances attendant upon a fire aboard ship which occurred in a foreign port, many months prior to the institution of an action in our courts wherein the truth as to such facts and circumstances may  be found to be of vital importance.   At the same time we can not lose  sight of the fact that the master  of the <em>Kaloma<\/em>  continued  in  the employ of the defendant after the fire took place and up to the time when his deposition was actually taken, so that, in these days of cables and rapid transportation, there  would not seem to have  been an absolutely insuperable difficulty  in  securing from him such information supported by affidavits as would doubtless have secured the necessary continuance in the court below to give opportunity for the taking and submission of the deposition before the entry of judgment in first instance.<\/p>\n<p>Having in mind, however, the amount involved and all the circumstances of the case, we think that under the provisions of subsection 2 of section 497 of the Code of Civil Procedure we should grant a  new trial upon the payment by defendant and appellant of all the costs accrued in both instances  up to the date of the  entry of judgment in  this court, and upon  the further  condition that plaintiff  will be permitted, if he elects so to do, to dismiss his complaint at any time within thirty  days from  the return of the record to the court below, without further special condemnation of costs.<\/p>\n<p>Twenty days after notification of this decision to counsel for appellant,  let judgment be entered affirming the judgment of the court below  with  the costs  of this instance in favor of  appellee, unless prior thereto the defendant-appellant shall have filed with the clerk of this  court a written acceptance of the conditions provided for the allowance of a new trial, in which event judgment will be entered reversing the judgment of the court below without costs in this instance  and directing a new trial,  wherein such further and additional  evidence will be admitted as either of the parties desire to submit touching the loss of the goods of the plaintiff in the  harbor at Singapore.

In March, 1910, the same plaintiff began another action against the same defendant for the recovery of P12,318.57; this case was known as No. 7719 in said court. Subsequent to the beginning of the above actions, and on or about the 30th day of April, 1910, the members of the company of Oria Hermanos &amp; Co., on account of the expiration of the time stated in their agreement of copartnership, dissolved their relations and entered into liquidation. On the 1st day of June, 1910, Tomas Oria y Balbas, as managing partner in liquidation, acting for himself and on behalf of his other coowners Casimiro Oria y Balbas and Adolfo Fuster Robles, entered into a contract with the plaintiff in this case, Manuel Oria Gonzalez, which said contract was for the purpose of selling and transferring to the plaintiff in this action all of the property of which the said Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. was owner. Said instrument contained the following clauses:<br\/><blockquote>\"5. I, Tomas Oria y Balbas, do further state and declare that I have agreed with the other party hereto, Don Manuel Oria y Gonzalez, to sell all the property I have mentioned, which is specified more in detail in the general inventory of Oria Hermanos &amp; Co., for the price and under the conditions hereinafter expressed; and in order to carry into effect such agreement made by me with the said Don Manuel Oria y Gonzalez, in my own right and also in representation of my partners, Don Casimiro Oria and Don Adolfo Fuster, I do hereby stipulate and agree:<br\/><br\/>\"6.

I, Manuel Oria y Gonzalez, being informed of the foregoing action and contract executed by Don Tomas Oria y Balbas, do on my part stipulate and agree: that I accept the sale, cession and transfer hereby made by him in my favor and engage and undertake to pay to Oria Hermanos &amp; Co., either in liquidation, or if necessary to the partners of Oria Hermanos &amp; Co., the price of said sale, cession and transfer, that is, the sum of P274,000, within a period of 12 years, in the manner and under the conditions set forth by him in the preceding section, and especially engage not to sell, alienate, transfer or mortgage the property involved in this sale which is specified in paragraph (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">d<\/span>) of the preceding section, without the previous written authorization of the vendor, Oria Hermanos &amp; Co., such property being so exempted as a guaranty for the payment of the purchase price of this sale.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Among the goods transferred by this instrument was the steamship <i>Serantes<\/i>, which is the subject of this litigation.<br\/><br\/>On the 17th day of September, 1910, case No. 7719, above referred to, was resolved by the Court of First Instance in favor of Gutierrez Hermanos and against Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. for the sum demanded in the complaint. The cause was appealed to the Supreme Court and, the judgment therein having been affirmed,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> execution was issued thereon and placed in the hands of the sheriff of Manila. The sheriff immediately demanded that Tomas Oria y Balbas, as liquidator of the firm of Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. make payment of the said judgment, to which he replied that there were no funds with which to pay the same. Thereupon the sheriff levied upon the said steamer <i>Serantes<\/i>, took possession of the same, and announced it for sale at public auction on the 21st day of October, 1910. On the 18th day of October, 1910, three days before the sale, the plaintiff in this action presented to the sheriff a written statement claiming to be the owner of the said steamship, and to have the right of possession of the same by reason of the sale to him by Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. of all of the property belonging to said company, including the said steamer <i>Serantes<\/i>, as shown by the instrument above referred to and quoted. The sheriff thereupon required Gutierrez Hermanos to present a bond for his protection, which having been done, the sheriff proceeded to the sale of the said steamship. At the sale Gutierrez Hermanos became the purchaser, said company being the highest bidder, and the sum which it paid being the highest sum bidden for the same.<br\/><br\/>On the 19th day of October, 1911, the plaintiff began the present action, which has for its object, as shown by the prayer of the complaint: First, the issuance of a preliminary injunction to prevent the sale of said steamship; and, second, the declaration that the plaintiff is the owner of said steamship and is entitled to the possession of the same, and that the defendant be required to restore the same to the plaintiff and to pay P10,000 damages for its detention.<br\/><br\/>Upon the trial judgment was found in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff, and the complaint was dismissed upon the merits with costs. From that judgment this appeal is taken.<br\/><br\/>The substantial question presented for our consideration is the validity of the sale from Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. to Manuel Oria y Gonzalez as against the creditors of said company. It is the contention of Gutierrez Hermanos that said sale is fraudulent as against the creditors of Oria Hermanos &amp; Co., and that the transfer thereby consummated of the steamship in question was void as to said creditors and as to Gutierrez Hermanos in particular.<br\/><br\/>There is some contention on the part of the plaintiffs that aside from the property included in the sale referred to, Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. had sufficient other property to pay the judgment of Gutierrez Hermanos. The trial court found, however, against the plaintiff in this regard. A careful examination of the record fails to disclose any sufficient reason for the reversal of this finding. While the evidence is somewhat conflicting, we are of the opinion that there is sufficient to sustain the findings made.<br\/><br\/>In determining whether or not the sale in question was fraudulent as against creditors, these facts must be kept in mind:<br\/><br\/>1. At the time of said sale the value of the assets of Oria Hermanos &amp; Co., as stated by the partners themselves, was P274,000.<br\/><br\/>2. That at the time of said sale actions were pending against said company by one single creditor for sums aggregating in amount nearly P160,000.<br\/><br\/>3. The vendee of said sale was a son of Tomas Oria y Balbas and a nephew of the other two persons heretofore mentioned which said three brothers together constituted all of the members of said company.<br\/><br\/>4. Nothing of value seems to have been delivered by the plaintiff in consideration of said sale and no security whatever was given for the payments therein provided for.<br\/><br\/>5. The plaintiff is a young man twenty-five years of age. There is no pretense whatever that he owned any property or had any business at the time of the sale. On the contrary it appears without contradiction that, when the sale took place, he was merely a student without assets and without gainful occupation.<br\/><br\/>6. Plaintiff, at the time of the sale, was fully aware of the two suits that had already been begun against the company whose assets he was purchasing and well knew that if said suits should terminate in favor of the plaintiffs therein the judgments in which they terminated would have to be paid out of the property which he was then taking over or they would not be paid at all.<br\/><br\/>7. Under all the circumstances the sale in question was, so far as the creditors were concerned, without consideration. To turn over a business worth P274,000 to an \"impecunious and vocationless youth\" who knew absolutely nothing about the business he received, and whose adaptability to the management of that business was entirely unknown, without a penny being paid down, without any security whatever, is a proceeding so unusual, so devoid of care and caution, and so wholly outside of the well defined lines of ordinary business transactions, as to startle any person interested in the concern.<br\/><br\/>8. It is certain that the members of the company of Oria Hermanos &amp; Co. would never have made a similar contract or executed a similar instrument with a stranger.<br\/><br\/>9. The prohibition in the contract against the sale of certain portions of the property by the plaintiff offers no protection whatever to the creditors. Such prohibition is not security. The parties who made the original transfer can waive and release it at pleasure. Such restriction is of no value to the creditors of the company. They can not utilize it for the reduction of their claims or in any other beneficial way.<br\/><br\/>In determining whether or not a certain conveyance is fraudulent the question in every case is whether the conveyance was a bona fide transaction or a trick and contrivance to defeat creditors, or whether it conserves to the debtor a special right. It is not sufficient that it is founded on good consideration or is made with bona fide intent: it must have both elements. If defective in either of these particulars, although good between the parties, it is voidable as to creditors. The rule is universal both at law and in equity that whatever fraud creates justice will destroy. The test as to whether or not a conveyance is fraudulent is, does it prejudice the rights of creditors?<br\/><br\/>In the consideration of whether or not certain transfers were fraudulent, courts have laid down certain rules by which the fraudulent character of the transaction may be determined. The following are some of the circumstances attending sales which have been denominated by the courts badges of fraud:<br\/><br\/>1. The fact that the consideration of the conveyance is fictitious or is inadequate.<br\/><br\/>2. A transfer made by a debtor after suit has been begun while it is pending against him.<br\/><br\/>3. A sale upon credit by an insolvent debtor.<br\/><br\/>4. Evidence of large indebtedness or complete insolvency.<br\/><br\/>5. The transfer of all or nearly all of his property by a debtor, especially when he is insolvent or greatly embarrassed financially.<br\/><br\/>6. The fact that the transfer is made between father and son, when there are present other of the above circumstances.<br\/><br\/>7. The failure of the vendee to take exclusive possession of all the property.<br\/><br\/>The case at bar presents every one of the badges of fraud above enumerated. Tested by the inquiry, does the sale prejudice the rights of creditors, the result is clear. The sale in the form in which it was made leaves the creditors substantially without recourse. The property of the company is gone, its income is gone, the business itself is likely to fail, the property is being dissipated, and is depreciating in value. As a result, even if the claims of the creditors should live twelve years and the creditors themselves wait that long, it is more than likely that nothing would be found to satisfy their claims at the end of the long wait. (Regalado vs. Luchsinger &amp; Co., 5 Phil. Rep., 625; art. 1297, Civil Code, par. 1; Manresa's Commentaries, vol. 8, pp. 713-719.)<br\/><br\/>Since the record shows that there was no property with which the judgment in question could be paid, the defendants were obliged to resort to and levy upon the steamer in suit. The court below was correct in finding the sale fraudulent and void as to Gutierrez Hermanos <i>in so far as was necessary to permit the collection of its judgment<\/i>. As a corollary, the court below found that the evidence failed to show that the plaintiff was the owner or entitled to the possession of the steamer in question at the time of the levy and sale complained of, or that he was damaged thereby. Defendant had the right to make the levy and test the validity of the sale in that way, without first resorting to a direct action to annul the sale. The creditor may attack the sale by ignoring it and seizing under his execution the property, or any necessary portion thereof, which is the subject of the sale.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the judgment is affirmed, without special finding as to costs. So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

ANTONINO DE ASIS,  DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.\n  <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"><p>This is an appeal from  the action of  the court below in declining under section 689 of the  Code of Civil Procedure to extend, in the exercise of its discretion, the time allowed for the presentation of a claim by appellant to the committee appointed for the examination and allowance of such claims, in the matter of the estate of Luis Rafael Yangco, deceased; and in declining further to provide for the submission of. this claim as  a contingent claim  before a committee appointed for that purpose under the provisions of sections 746, 747, 748,  and 749 of the Code  bf Civil Procedure.<\/p>\n<p>It appears that before the death of Luis Rafael Yangco, the appellant instituted an action against him to  recover the fair value of certain medical services, alleged to amount to some P8,713 Philippine currency; and that the following judgment was entered in that action:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This case this day came on for trial upon the complaint, answer, cross-complaint and proof, and while the plaintiff was on the witness stand,  pending his examination, he stated that he was losing too much time here in the trial of the case and that he wished to dismiss his complaint and make the defendant a present of his services: It is therefore.<\/p>\n<p>\"Ordered and adjudged by the court that this case be and the same is hereby dismissed, and that defendant,  Luis R. Yangco, recover of the plaintiff, Antonino de Asis, the cost of this case for which  execution may issue.<\/p>\n<p>\"Dated, Manila, P. I., September 11, 1905.<\/p>\n<p align=\"right\"> \"J. C. SWEENEY, <em>Judge.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Since the date of that judgment Luis R. Yangco died, and in the  course of the administration of his estate a committee was appointed under the provisions of section  686 of the Code of Civil Procedure to appraise the estate and to allow claims as therein provided.   The time limited by the court for the presentation of claims has lapsed and the committee's report has been filed.   The  object of the petition of the appellant in this  proceeding, who failed or neglected to present his claim to the committee within the time allowed therefor, is to secure the extension of the time given to the original committee, or the appointment of a new committee, in order to submit to the committee thus authorized  to hear it, a claim against the estate of the deceased, Luis R. Yangco, for the medical services which were the subject  of the litigation in which the above set out judgment dismissing the complaint was entered.<\/p>\n<p>The  contention of the claimant and appellant is that Luis R. Yangco,  deceased, not having accepted during his lifetime the gift of the value of these services to which reference is made in the above set  out judgment, he, the claimant and appellant, is entitled to recover the value of these services from Yangco's estate. The court below held otherwise, and declined to make provision for the submission of this claim.<\/p>\n<p>Without discussing or considering the grounds upon which claimant bases his cause of action against the estate of the deceased, we are of opinion that upon his own showing as to the facts, the action of the lower court in refusing to extend the time within which the original committee might examine this claim, or to appoint a new committee for its examination, must be sustained.   The judgment of  dismissal above set out finally,  conclusively and definitely  determined the right of claimant and appellant to recover fcfr the services in question.   The dismissal of the complaint in the former action with  costs to the defendant is a complete bar to another action for the same cause.<\/p>\n<p>Claimant and appellant seems to be under the impression that the dismissal having been had at his  own suggestion and request, he is not barred  from instituting new  proceedings. Section 127 of the Code of Civil  Procedure is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Dismissal of actions<\/em>.\u2014An action may be  dismissed, with costs to the defendant, in the following cases:<\/p>\n<p>\" (a) By the plaintiff himself, by written request to the clerk filed among the papers in the case, at any time before trial, upon payment of the costs; provided  a counterclaim has not been made or affirmative relief sought by the  cross complaint or answer of the defendant, or provided the judge shall not decide that the defendant has made such preparation for trial that it would be unjust to permit a dismissal without a trial on the merits.<\/p>\n<p>\"(b) By the court) when the plaintiff fails to appear at the time of  trial, and the defendant appears and  asks for the dismissal.<\/p>\n<p>\"(c) By the court, when the plaintiff fails, for an unreasonable length of time, to prosecute his action.<\/p>\n<p>\"In either  of these three cases a dismissal of the action shall not be a bar to another action for the  same cause.<\/p>\n<p>\" (d) The court may also, in its discretion, allow a plaintiff to dismiss the action on payment of the costs after the trial has begun and at any time before Anal judgment,  if the interests of justice so require, and in this case the dismissal shall not be a bar to another action for the same cause.  The dismissal shall be entered on the docket of the court and  shall be effective,  when  so entered, to end the action.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It will readily be seen that the dismissal of the former action does not fall under any of these heads;  It is quite clear that  the  dismissal  of that action was a  dismissal \"without day.\"  It was a dismissal by the court after complaint, answer and cross complaint had been filed and the case called for trial, and the trial judge did  not exercise his discretion \"in the interests of justice\" to allow the plaintiff to dismiss  the  action and to  reserve the right  to institute a new action if he so desired.   On the contrary, the ground of the dismissal was that the plaintiff in that action wished \"to make a present of his services to the defendant,\" and thus bring  an  end to  the litigation.  Judgment  was rendered against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendant on the sole ground that plaintiff did not desire  to proceed with the case, and not only was there no suggestion that plaintiff desired the court to exercise its discretion to permit him to institute another action for the services in question,  but on the contrary it was expressly stated  that such was not the case.   Manifestly the plaintiff in that  action has lost his right to recover for the alleged services, if indeed,  he ever had a right so to do.<\/p>\n<p>The orders of the trial court declining to  provide for the submission of the claim in question to a committee should be and are hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The record discloses that an irregular unregistered commercial partnership doing business under the firm name of Strachan &amp; MacMurray sold to the defendant a traction  engine and various accessories; that the members of this partnership were William MacMurray and John Young; and that there is still due and unpaid on this engine the sum of P3,878.50.  Judgment was rendered in favor of William MacMurray and John Young, the individual members of the complaining partnership,  for the amount due the firm, together  with the  costs of the action.  The cause is now before this court upon a duly approved bill of exceptions.<\/p>\n<p>The allegation of the complaint that the firm  of Strachan &amp; MacMurray is a duly registered partnership under the laws in force in the Philippine Islands is not supported by the evidence.  One of the partners,  William  MacMurray, admits that it was not so registered, and it does not appear that the partnership ever was organized in due  form.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for appellant insists that the plaintiff  in this action being an irregular, unregistered commercial partnership doing  business  under  the firm name of  Strachan &amp; MacMurray, was without juridical personality  to institute or maintain this action.  It appears from the record, however,  that the defendant had a number of business transactions with this irregular  unregistered commercial partnership doing business under the firm name of  Strachan &amp; MacMurray, covering a period of several years.   It further appears that Messrs. MacMurray, Strachan, and Young were at one time associated together in business, with offices at Iloilo.   But the court below,  upon  the pleadings and  the evidence,  found that William MacMurray  and John Young were the actual parties doing business under the firm name of Strachan &amp; MacMurray at the time when the  transaction in question was had, and that they were the real plaintiffs in this action, and entitled to recover judgment upon  the proof adduced at the trial; we must assume, therefore, that although the complaint was not formally  amended, it was taken to be amended  so as to show these parties the real plaintiffs before judgment was actually entered.<\/p>\n<p>If the question of the juridical personality of the plaintiffs  had  been duly  raised  by demurrer or answer, the complaint might have been and doubtless would have been amended,  and such an amendment would properly have been allowed at the couclusion of the trial had a formal motion for that purpose been filed by the real parties plaintiff, who <em>de facto<\/em>  maintained the action in the court below. If the failure to order a formal amendment was error, it was at most error not prejudicial to the real rights of the defendant, and we do not believe that the judgment should be reversed for a mere technical defect which did not reach the issues, involved, and in  no wise prejudiced the rights of the appellant.<\/p>\n<p>We have frequently held that while an irregular unregistered commercial partnership has no juridical personality as such to maintain a suit and recover judgment in the partnership name, nevertheless the individual members of such a firm may maintain a suit  jointly, and persons dealing with the partnership are estopped from denying the right of the members of the partnership .so to do.   (Prautch &amp; Scholes <em>vs.<\/em> Jones, 8 Phil. Rep., 1; Yu Bunuan <em>vs.<\/em> Marcaida, 10 Phil. Rep., 265; Ang Seng Quen <em>vs.<\/em> Te Chico, 12 Phil. Rep., 547.)<\/p>\n<p>Upon full consideration of the whole case, we find no error prejudicial to the rights  of the appellant,  and hold that the defect in  the complaint assigned as error  by the  appellant was cured by  the proceedings and judgment in  the court below.   The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with the costs of tlie appeal in this instance against the appellant.

Said land was appraised at the last assessment for payment of the land tax; and there is no encumbrance on  it, nor any third person who has any right  or share therein, with the exception of Gabriel Enrico, who  claims  to  be the owner thereof.  The applicants acquired the land by inheritance from their deceased father, Bernardo Tobias, and it is now held by the said Gabriel Enrico.<\/p>\n<p>After service of the required  notices and advertisement in the newspapers, Gabriel  Enrico y Custodio,  in his own behalf and  in representation of his brothers and sisters, Hermenegildo, Apolonio, Primo,  Valentina and Paulina, all surnamed Enrico y Custodio, opposed the registration applied for, alleging that the land belongs to them by inheritance from their deceased parents, Marcelo Enrico and Celedonia Custodio, who acquired it by purchase from another person, through just title and in good faith, more than 16 years ago,  and thereafter held it in quiet  and peaceable possession as owners, which possession was continued by the opponents without being disturbed by anyone. Therefore, he asked that the decree of registration be issued  in the name of the opponents, and in support of his petition exhibited a possessory information title or certificate of possessory proceedings, inscribed in the  registry, and receipts for the payment of the land tax.<\/p>\n<p>After  the hearing of the case and the introduction of testimony by the parties, the court, on July 20,1910, decided the case by dismissing the claim presented by the opponents and  holding that, after entry of general default, the applicants  aforementioned were the owners of the land <em>pro indiviso,<\/em> with the exception of the undivided share  of the applicant Serapion  Tobias which was encumbered  by  a mortgage held by the opponents, and  ordered the said land inscribed in the  registry  in the  name  of  the  seven applicants; and, in view of the fact that an exact survey had not been made of the land, which is agricultural, although the applicants were  entitled to the benefits  of Chapter VI of Act No. 926, he ordered that the clerk forward a copy of the plan and specifications of the land, together with a certified copy of the resolution of the court, to the Director of Lands for the purpose of the procedure provided by section 66 of the said Act;  and that, as soon as this resolution should become final, the necessary decree, orders, and  certificates be issued, with the  costs against the applicants.<\/p>\n<p>Serapion Tobias, one of the applicants, asked by written motion for  an amendment to  the judgment  in the part thereof concerning him, stating that the private instrument of mortgage had not been registered under the Mortgage Law, and therefore  did not affect the property, according to article 1875 of the Civil Code, as the said mortgage was not validly constituted, and that the  opponents could only institute a personal action.<\/p>\n<p>A hearing having been  had  on this motion, the judge, by an order of  August 8, 1910, held that the opponent, Gabriel Enrico, should have an opportunity to prove more extensively the nature of  the instrument and to present the same, if possible, and accordingly allowed him to adduce further evidence, fixing a day and hour in the court-room therefor.<\/p>\n<p>After such further proceedings, the court,  by  an order of January 17, 1911, overruled the applicants' motion and directed that the decree be issued them, with record therein of the P50 mortgage held by the opponents upon the part of the land belonging to the applicant Serapion Tobias.<\/p>\n<p>On the 24th of the same month of January, counsel for the opponents  excepted  to the  aforesaid judgment and asked for a rehearing on the grounds stated and for the further reason of the discovery of new evidence in their behalf.  The court,  after consideration of the motion, reversed its former judgment by an  order of February 4, 1911, and ordered  a new  trial, and, in view  of the new evidence adduced, found,  on February 13, 1911, that the applicants, Andres, Serapion,  Leoncio,  Crispin,  Monico, Maxima and Regino, all surnamed Tobias y Sandoval, were the owners in fee simple of the land in question; wherefore, in accordance with the previous judgment (pp. 96 to 99 of the record), he ordered the inscription or registration of the said land <em>pro indiviso<\/em> in the  name of the applicants, with  Serapion Tobias'  portion  subject to the mortgage hereinbefore discussed, and after survey  of  the  land, in accordance with section 66 of  Act No.  926,  issuance of the required decrees, orders  and certificates, with costs against the applicants.  Counsel for the opponents excepted to this judgment, and presented the proper bill of  exceptions, which was approved and  forwarded to the clerk of this court.<\/p>\n<p>This case concerns the registration in the Court of Land Registration of a tract of land situated  in the  barrio of Santo Angel of the  pueblo of Santa Cruz, Province  of Laguna, alleged to belong to the  seven applicants, who  inherited the property, .which is still undivided, from their deceased  father, Bernardo Tobias,  the original  owner of the land.<\/p>\n<p>Gabriel Enrico opposed the registration sought, alleging that Serapion Tobias, one of the applicants,  had sold the land in question to his father,  Marcelo Enrico,  and that, therefore, the opponent Gabriel Enrico and his five brothers and sisters were the present owners o$ the  property, as they had inherited the  same from  the vendee, Marcelo Enrico, their deceased father; but Serapion Tobias stated in an affidavit (p. 41 of the record) that in fact he  did mortgage the  said land for the  sum of  50 pesos, which was lent him by the spouses Marcelo Enrico and Celedonia Custodio who, as his creditors, were to receive one-half of the fruits  produced on the land, but he denied  that  he had sold the property to them, as they alleged, for on  various occasions  he had endeavored to redeem it, but  had been thwarted in his  purpose through certain pretexts made by Gabriel Enrico.  The deponent, Tobias, added that the land was mortgaged without the knowledge of his six brothers and sisters.<\/p>\n<p>During the trial the  opponents exhibited  a certificate issued  by the registrar of property of  Laguna on October 1, 1896, attesting the inscription in the registry of a record of possessory proceedings, prosecuted  by Marcelo  Enrico in the Court of First Instance, relative to the land in question, which  record was  approved  on June 19, 1896.   The said certificate recites that the possessory  information proceedings were had in order to attest his  possession for about two years of the land he had purchased from Serapion Tobias for 60 pesos. But notwithstanding the contents of the said certificate the judge of  the  Court of  Land  Registration held that only the part pro indiviso of the land in question belonging to Serapion Tobias was encumbered  or mortgaged,  since the latter was not the owner  of the whole of the land nor 6ould he  dispose of the whole of it without the knowledge and consent of his six coheirs, who took no  part whatever in the act executed  by him in  encumbering the  land of joint ownership without the consent of his coheirs and  to their prejudice.   With regard  to  the form of acquisition  of the land entered in the registrar's certificate, it is  merely the  statement of the  interested party, which the registrar recorded  in his memorandum of registration, but without certifying to the truth of such statement of the interested party, Marcelo Enrico, that is, of the sale alleged in the document,  for the sole purpose of the document was to certify the inscription in the property registry of  a record of possessory proceedings had before the Court of First Instance with reference to  the land in question.<\/p>\n<p>In the judgment appealed from it is held that the part of the property  pertaining to Serapion Tobias is subject to the said mortgage, and, though the writer hereof believes that it is improper to consider a mortgage established which has not been constituted in  a public instrument nor inscribed in the property registry, in  accordance with  the provisions of article 1875  of the  Civil Code, yet the fact is that no appeal  whatever against this finding of the judgment was taken by the applicant  Serapion  Tobias, who is affected thereby.<\/p>\n<p>Accepting in all other respects the grounds of the judgment appealed from and taking account of the fact that counsel for the opponents  has not requested a new trial, wherefore it  would be improper to proceed with an examination and review of  the evidence taken at the trial,  the case must be  decided in conformity with the facts contained in such judgment.<\/p>\n<p>For  the foregoing reasons,  whereby the errors assigned by the appellants are deemed to have been refuted, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should.be, as it is hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Upon arresting the delinquents and taking them to the city hall, the accused was in the habit of receiving from them various sums of money wherewith to pay their cedula taxes, issuing receipts to\u00a0 the persons who thus delivered money to him.\u00a0 Once\u00a0 he turned into the\u00a0 treasury P50, which he received in the manner before stated, with a list of the persons to whom cedulas were to be issued in exchange for the receipts issued\u00a0 by him.<\/p><p> \"One Claro Rentoria,\u00a0 who was arrested in the barrio of Guinlajon for\u00a0 not\u00a0 having\u00a0 a\u00a0 cedula, upon\u00a0 being\u00a0 taken to the house of the lieutenant of the barrio,\u00a0 there delivered to the accused the sum of two pesos wherewith to get a cedula for the year 1909, which said Rentoria had not yet bought, the latter promising\u00a0 to\u00a0 deliver later on two\u00a0 more\u00a0 pesos, for he was obliged to\u00a0 pay\u00a0 the penalty for\u00a0 delinquency.

No. 6286, March 26, 1912<\/h2>\n<h3>GAVINA FERNANDEZ, AS JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE ESTATE OF THE  DECEASED PEDRO  PENA,  PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE,  VS. EULOGIO TRIA, AS  JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED FRANCISCA PENA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.\n  <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"><p>Clemente Pena at the time of his death was the owner of some  real  estate,  cattle, and other  personal  property. Among his heirs he left a son named Pedro Pena.  When the estate of Clemente Pena was divided, Pedro Pena had already died and his daughter, named Francisca Pena, received his portion of the inheritance.   She was  then a minor  and a guardian, Ramon Ortiz, was appointed, and the latter  took over and administered the property that had come to Francisca Pena, through her father, from the estate of the afore-said Clemente Pena.  Francisca Pena married Eulogio  Tria and died March 2, 1902.<\/p>\n<p>After the death of Francisca Pena, her surviving husband, Eulogio Tria, made application,  on January 13, 1903, for the appointment of a judicial administrator  for the intestate estate of his late wife,  and was himself  appointed.   He presented an inventory of the  property of the deceased, which inventory  included seven parcels of  land.  But commissioners of appraisal  were  appointed  and  appraised thirty-four parcels, and there the proceedings of that administration terminated.<\/p>\n<p>On January 18, 1907, Gavina Fernandez also made special application for the appointment of an administration for the property which Pedro Pefia had left at his decease, by a will executed and  probated under the late sovereignty. and the petitioner herself, Gavina Fernandez, widow of the said Pedro Pena, was appointed.  In the same instrument she asked for the partition of the estate of Pedro Pena, and there the proceedings terminated.<\/p>\n<p>Later, on July 23, 1908, Gavina Fernandez, as such judicial administratrix, instituted the present suit praying for judgment in her favor and  against the defendant for the ownership and possession  of the property set forth in the complaint, for P2,000 damages and the costs.<\/p>\n<p>The material facts of the complaint are: the third, wherein it  is averred that the hereditary succession of the deceased Pedro Pena is the owner and is entitled to ownership and possession of the property which is then described, to wit,  according to the fourth fact, seven parcels of rural land,  and five horses, the condition of the  latter being a matter of surmise (B. of e., 2 and 3);  and  the fifth, in which it is averred  that  the defendant Eulogio Tria,  as judicial administrator of the property left by the deceased Francisca Pena (second fact) illegally retains, in his possession the property described in the complaint and claims to have rights therein adverse to those of the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>In his reply the defendant confines himself to a generaldenial.<\/p>\n<p>From the evidence adduced, the Court of First Instance of Ambos Camarines, which tried the case, decided it \"in favor of the plaintiff  in her capacity as administratrix for the deceased Pedro Pena, declaring that  she  was entitled  to possession during the probate proceedings with reference to the real property described in the complaint and ordering the defendant to deliver it to her.\"   (B. of e., 8 and 9).<\/p>\n<p>The defendant prepared a bill of exceptions and appealed to this court, submitting the following assignments of error:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li> In  having declared  the  plaintiff-administratrix owner of the land sought.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> In  denying the  request for a new trial on the ground that the judgment is not  sustained by the evidence.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>With reference  to  the  first assignment, the trial court made no declaration  of ownership.  It merely stated the conclusion that the plaintiff, as administratrix of the estate of Pedro Pena, was entitled  to possession of the property described in the complaint so that she might act as <em>administratrix during<\/em> the probate proceedings  of  the  estate of Pedro Pena, and that  when the debts had been paid, if any existed, and said proceedings  were terminated, the property remaining should be divided among the heirs; and judgment was rendered to this effect.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the second, no error was incurred in denying the request for a new trial, for the evidence adduced sufficiently sustains the conclusions in the judgment.<\/p>\n<p>The trial court held the following facts to be proven:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li> That Pedro Pena was the son of Clemente Pena,  and that the latter died before the former.  A fact admitted by the defendant.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> That the land described in  the complaint belonged to Clemente Pena and, according to his will, said land belonged to Pedro Pena as heir, and for this reason it was  delivered first to Ramon Ortiz  as guardian of Francisca  Pena  and later to her, aided  by her husband Eulogio Tria,  in whose possession it now is as judicial administrator of the intestate estate of Francisca Pena.  A fact not refuted by the defendant.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> That, according to the will of the deceased Pedro Pena, his  widow  Gavina  Fernandez and his legitimate  daughter Francisca Pena are his heirs.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The clause in the will of Pedro Pena wherein this testamentary disposition of his is made reads thus:  \"<em>Item<\/em>.\u2014I affirm that  I have been married three times: The first time to Dona Maria Ramirez, by whom I had six children, all now dead; the second  time to Dona  Petrona  Fernandez, also dead,  from  which marriage  we  have a minor  daughter named Francisca; and the third time to Dona Gavina Fernandez, by  whom I have another  son, named  Ambrosio, <em>to whom I leave, as heirs by force of law,<\/em> one-half of all my property to my daughter <em>Francisca<\/em>, and the other <em>half<\/em> to my wife Gavina Fernandez and son Ambrosio.\"<\/p>\n<p>This son Ambrosio died after his father,  and his rights of inheritance passed by operation of law  to  his mother Gavina Fernandez, a fact that does not appear to be contradicted by the oral evidence adduced.<\/p>\n<p>That  the  property described in the  complaint is  the same which  appears in the  inventory,  presented by  the appellant as  remaining at the death of his wife Francisca Peiia,  when  he asked for the judicial  administration of her intestate estate (Exhibit  A of the plaintiff), the same which,  together  with other property, was enumerated in the  inventory made by  the  commissioners of appraisal in said  proceedings  in the intestate  succession of Francisca Pena (Exhibit B  of  the plaintiff), and  finally  the same which, together with other property, appears to have been turned over by the guardian of  Francisca Peiia,  Ramon Ortiz, to the attorney  in fact  of the married couple, Eulogio  Tria  and  Francisca Pena  (Exhibit   C  of  the plaintiff).<\/p>\n<p>Therefore  there  is no  justification for the request  for a  new trial on the ground  that the judgment  is not sustained  by the evidence.<\/p>\n<p>It is. clearly  established  that Francisca  Pena,  instead of her father Pedro Pena,  received all  the  property that the latter's father had left  him, and that  this property did not all belong  to Francisca Pena, but only a  half of it, according  to  the express  disposition  of Pedro Pena. The other half belonged to Gavina Fernandez, and in order to secure  it,  she instituted special proceedings wherein she was  appointed  judicial administratrix  of  the estate of her  deceased husband, Pedro  Pena,  with  the object and for  the  purpose the law  fixes, in order to transmit the inheritance  from the hands of him  who leaves  it at his death to those who, according to his wish or according to the  provisions of law,.are  entitled to  receive it.<\/p>\n<p>The  law provides  that, when a  will  has been  proved and  allowed,  the court shall  issue  letters testamentary thereon to the person  named  as executor therein,  if he accepts the trust and gives the bond required by law.  The term \"executor\"  in this Act shall include  an administrator with the will annexed.   (Code of Civ. Proc, sec. 641.)<\/p>\n<p>If no executor  is named'in the will, or if a person dies intestate, the  administration shall first be  granted to the surviving husband or wife.  (Ibid., 642.)<\/p>\n<p>In appointing  as administratrix for the estate of the deceased, Pedro  Pefia  his  widow Gavina  Fernandez the court acted in conformity  with these legal provisions.<\/p>\n<p>The law further provides that \"every executor or administrator, unless he is residuary  legatee and has given the bond prescribed  for the residuary  legatee, shall, within three months  after his appointment, return  to the  court a true inventory  of the real  estate and  all the  gootls, chattels, rights and  credits of  the  deceased which  come into his possession or knowledge.  (Ibid.,  668.)<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"An  executor  or administrator may commence,  prosecute, or defend, in the right of the deceased, actions which survive to such executor or administrator,  and are necessary  for the  recovery  and protection of  the property or rights of the  deceased, and may prosecute or defend such actions or suits commenced in the lifetime of the deceased. (Ibid., 702.)<\/p>\n<p>\"Actions to recover the title or possession of real estate, buildings, or any  interest therein, actions to recover  damages for an injury to person or property, real or personal, and actions to recover  the  possession of specific articles of personal property, shall survive, and may be commenced and prosecuted by or against the executor or administrator.\"   (Ibid.,  703.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In  conformity with  these provisions and in accordance with  general principles  of  law,  the plaintiff Gavina Fernandez, as  administratrix  of  the estate  of Pedro Pena has  been  able to say  justly in  her complaint that the hereditary succession of this deceased is the owner and is         entitled to ownership and possession of the property, which is withheld by the defendant, Eulogio Tria, in his capacity  as administrator of the intestate estate of  Francisca Pena, property the identity of which, according to the copy of the inventories made of said intestate estate, is set forth by the trial judge,  against which statement and finding this Supreme Court finds no error to have been committed, and property which, as  was properly asked in the  complaint and  as  ordered in  the  judgment  appealed from, should be in the possession and under the administration of the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>Once in possession, there should be applied the principle which this  Supreme Court  has laid down in interpreting the  law:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"By section 641, when a  will is  proved it is obligatory upon the court to appoint  an executor  or administrator. By  virtue of  other  provisions of the code this  executor or administrator has, under the direction of the court, the full  administration and control of the deceased's property, real and personal,  until  a final decree is made in accordance with section  753.  During the period  of  administration  the heirs, devisees, and legatees have no  right to interfere with  the administrator or executor  in the.discharge of his duties.   They have  no right,  without his consent, to  the possession of any part of the  estate, real or personal.  The  theory of the present  system  is that the  property  is all <em>in the  hands<\/em> of the court, and must stay there until the affairs  of the  deceased are  adjusted and  liquidated, and  then the  net balance  is turned  over to the persons by law  entitled to it.   *  *  *   After the estate is fully settled,  and all the debts and  expenses of administration are paid, the law contemplates that there shall be  a hearing  or trial in this proceeding in the Court of First Instance for the purpose of determining  who the parties are that are entitled to the  estate in the  hands of the executor or administrator for distribution, and after such hearing or trial it is made the duty of the  court to enter a decree or final judgment, in which decree, according to section 753, the court 'shall assign the  residue of the estate to the persons entitled to the same,  and in its order the court shall  name  the  persons  and proportions or parts to  which each  is entitled\/ \"  (Pimentel <em> vs.<\/em> Palanca, 5 Phil. Rep., 439, 440.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Until this  time comes, therefore, it can not be determined which is the property or, which is the part thereof that belongs to the intestate estate of Francisca Pena, and until such time there is no property <em>belonging<\/em> to Francisca Pena or to Gavina Fernandez, but only  property <em>belonging to<\/em> the intestate estate of Pedro Pena.<\/p>\n<p>To assert  rights of  ownership and  possession in favor of Francisca Pena, before determining what the property is which may fall to her from the estate of Pedro Pena, seems to be a plain absurdity that does not require demonstration,  just as there is no  need for demonstrating that an effect can not precede its cause.  Francisca  Pena and Gavina Fernandez are the  successors  in interest  of the estate of Pedro Pena, their predecessor in interest, and Francisca Pena can hardly have private property derived from Pedro  Pena's estate before  such estate  has been divided and  before Francisca Pena  and Gavina Fernandez have been legally assigned their respective portions.<\/p>\n<p>So the  judgment  appealed from  could  not  be  more in accordance with law,  with strict justice  and  with the dictates of reason, and it is therefore hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p>\n<em>Torres, Mapa,<\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<div align=\"center\"><br\/>\n<em>DISSENTING<\/em><\/div>\n<p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This  is an action of ejectment begun by Gavina  Fernandez, as administratrix of the estate of Pedro Pena, deceased,  against Eulogio Tria,  as  administrator of the estate of  Francisca Pena, deceased.<\/p>\n<p>The land in suit is owned,  according to the undisputed facts in  this case, and as found  by the decision of this court, as, follows:<\/p>\n<p>Gavina  Fernandez,  personally, an undivided  one-half interest.<\/p>\n<p>Eulogio Tria,  personally,  and his  only child,  Buenaventura, a minor, together own the other undivided  one-half part, as heirs of Francisca  Pefia, deceased, who,  prior to her death, owned said undivided  one-half part as tenant in  common with said Gavina Fernandez.<\/p>\n<p>So that Gavina Fernandez, representing a half  interest, and Eulogio Tria and his child, together representing the other half, are concededly owners and tenants in  common of the land in suit in this  case.<\/p>\n<p>The land  in question  was  originally  owned  by Pedro Pena, who concededly died in November, 1890.  He left a will divising an undivided  one-half  of  said  land to his widow,  Gavina Fernandez, and the  other undivided  one-half to his  daughter,  Francisca Pena.  Francisca Pena, immediately  on the death of her father,  Pedro Pena,  took possession of all  of said  lands and retained them till her death, which occurred on the 2d day  of March,  1902. She left, her surviving, as her only heirs at law, her husband, Eulogio  Tria,  and an only child, a son, Buenaventura, born on the 14th day of July, 1899.  These two  heirs  took possession  of the property left  by the wife and. mother and continue in the same at  present.<\/p>\n<p>During all the years from 1890 no one has ever questioned or challenged the ownership or the possession of  Francisca or her successors in interest.<\/p>\n<p>It will be noticed that  the only apparent parties to this action are <em>administrators.  Not one of the conceded owners of the land is a party.<\/em>   Neither Gavina Fernandez,  Eulogio Tria nor his  minor son is a party.<\/p>\n<p>It will also be noticed that,  although the  complaint alleges that  the  defendant administrator is in possession of the lands, that allegation  is denied by the answer, and there is no legal proof in the evidence showing the possession alleged.   The only witness who testified for the plaintiff on  that subject was Emilio  Fuentebella who said  that he <em>supposed or concluded<\/em> that the  possession was by  Eulogio as adminstrator <em>simply because  he was administrator<\/em>.  On the contrary, all  the  facts  and circumstances show that Eulogio  Tria and his  minor son  are  in  possession of the lands in question as heirs and owners and have been since the death of the wife and  mother in 1902.  In fact, this court finds as a fact that the administration of the estate of Francisca by her husband,  Eulogio,  as  administrator, <em>terminated in 1903.<\/em>  The court says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"After the death of Francisca Pena, her widower Eulogio Tria made application, on  January  13, 1903, for the appointment of a judicial administrator for the  intestate estate of his late wife, and  was himself appointed.  He presented an inventory of  the  property of the deceased, which inventory  included  seven  parcels  of land.  But commissioners of  appraisal were  appointed  and appraised thirty-four parcels, and there the proceedings of that administration  terminated.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In view  of this  positive  declaration  I do not  stop  to discuss the character and effect of certain  accounts introduced in evidence by the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>The result is that, if the  decision of this court  amounts to anything in the end,  it will  terminate in the exclusion of Eulogio Tria and his son,  Buenaventura, from the possession  of the land in dispute.  Moreover,  if  the defendant administrator is the representative of the  heirs,  then his expulsion from possession is equivalent, legally, to the expulsion of the heirs-themselves.   I therefore treat the matter from the point of view of the heirs themselves,<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, I dissent from this decision:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li> Because it recognizes  and  approves the wisdom and policy as well  as  the  validity of the  appointment of an administrator with the  will annexed <em>seventeen years after the death of  the person for  whose estate  the administrator was appointed<\/em> (Pedro Pena having died in 1890), when, at the time  of the appointment, there were  no  claims for or against the  estate,  when there  was no  personal property left by the deceased in  existence,  and when the real property left by the decedent had been continuously in the undisputed and unchallenged possession of his only child and devisee and her heirs for <em>seventeen<\/em> years.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> Because it sanctions and approves such appointment when, in my humble judgment, there was no legal or practical reason  justifying such appointment.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> Because it sanctions such appointment upon a  theory which, in my opinion,  misconstrues the object and purpose of administration under the law of the Islands\u2014the  theory of the court  being that, when heirs or devisees differ over their respective rights in real estate, such real estate should. by means of  the appointment of an administrator, be <em>taken away from all.<\/em>  This ignores the rights of owners of lands to settle their disputes' between themselves or by appealing to the court  in person.  It is the forcible appointment of a guardian for every  person who happens to be an heir and does not agree with his coheirs.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> Because 4 it lays  down  the proposition, and lays  it down as the policy of the law of administration in this country, that one can  do  by indirection what he cannot do by direction.  Gavina Fernandez  being  the  owner of an undivided half of the real estate in question, and that is all she claims, and Eulogio and Buenaventura being the owners of the other undivided  half, it is a principle unquestioned anywhere that Gavina could not dispossess them by any action or proceeding known to the law.  One tenant in common cannot <em>legally  dispossess<\/em> his  fellow  tenant in common.  Their rights are equal, and equal rights cannot in law or justice produce unequal results.   Both are entitled to possession, but not one alone.  Not being able,  then, to dispossess the defendants by direct attack, Gavina astutely takes the path of indirection.  She procures the appointment of an administrator; and lo,  a miracle is wrought, a right which  never  existed before  was  born, namely  the  right to drive from possession those whose rights in the premises from which they are expelled <em>are  inferior  to those  of no man<\/em>.   Prior  to speaking the mysterious  and portentous words which created the administration, all the powers of the estate  could  not have  dispossessed them.  There were no rights greater than theirs.  There was no justice that they did not share.  There was no one who could drive them from their home.  In spite of all this, the administratrix passes her  magic wand over this legal vacuum, this  receptacle, this space in which there is nothing,  and behold, it  is peopled with powers.  Where there was  nothing before, there is something now.   Where, before, there was nothing which could expel a person from land which he owned (and had  possessed for seventeen years  without  challenge), now there is a strange creature of the law which, without ownership, dispossesses the owner,  without right overcomes the rightful, and with nothing takes all.  By the utterance of a single word, \"appointed,\" the king becomes the beggar. Where direction  is unsuccessful, the devious ways of indirection meet success.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> Because, while giving miraculous  virtues to the appointment  of an administrator in one case, it gives none whatever to such appointment in another.  If the appointment of Gavina Fernandez as administratrix of the estate of Pedro Pena produces such miraculous results, why does not the appointment of  Eulogio Tria  as administrator  of the estate of Francisca Pena produce results equally miraculous ? It is certain that Francisca Pena was just as much the owner of her real estate as Pedro Pena was of his; and therefore if the administrator  of Pedro Pena can take his real estate away from everybody regardless of owners' rights, of law, equity, justice and everything else, why cannot the administrator of Francisca Pena do the same  thing with the real estate which she left?  If the administratrix of Pedro is an irresistible force as to the  real  property of Pedro, why is not the administrator of Francisca an irresistible force as to the real estate of Francisca?   This court, as well as the court below,  found the ownership of Francisca with the same force and effect as it found the ownership  of Pedro. Why, then, should the administrator  of Francisca give way to the  administratrix of Pedro?  If one can claim miraculous attributes, why cannot the other, and for  the same reason?  If one can succeed  with  nothing, why  cannot the other?  When two irresistible  forces come together     in opposition, the result is necessarily nil.  If the administratrix of Pedro claims that she  must take the real estate which  he owned to  administer  it, the administrator  of Francisca makes the same claim  relative to the real estate which  Francisca  owned.  If the administratrix of Pedro asserts that she must hold the real estate of Pedro during administration, so asserts the administrator of Francisca. Simply because Pedro Pena died first and Francisca's property came from him does not under the facts of this case give his administratrix superior powers over the administrator of Francisca.  In reality there never was, in effect, an estate of Pedro  Pena.  The appointment seventeen years after  his death was abortive.   The estate, if one ever came into existence, ceased to exist  on the distribution of the  property. (Sections 596, 597, Code of Civil Procedure; McMicking <em>vs.<\/em> Sy Conbieng, 21 Phil. Rep., 211.)   The appointment in 1907 could not give life to something which,  if it was ever born, died in 1890; nor can it destroy a status created by the division of the estate and a delivery of the property in 1890, which status obtained in 1907 when the futile  appointment of plaintiff was made.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> Because it deprives the owners of their rights of property without any  beneficial result whatever.   What is the administratrix to do with this property?  What <em>can<\/em> she do with it?  Absolutely nothing.  If  it  be said that the administratrix took it to divide between  the devisees  (a power attributed to an administrator which I deny, particularly relative to tenants in common, such proceedings being properly of partition under section 181 of  the Code  of  Civil Procedure), <em>I reply that we do not knoxu  that the devisees want to divide  it<\/em>.  There  is not a particle  of  evidence in  the record showing such a desire.  <em>Indeed, the devisees are not even parties<\/em>.  Surely the court will not divide real property among owners without their consent!  If it be urged that the administratrix took it to ascertain who the owners are, I reply that the administratrix admits the ownership of Eulogio and Buenaventura.  But, even  if it be conceded that the administratrix took the property,  and properly so, for the purposes mentioned,  that does not in any sense or to any degree justify the dispossession of the owners.   Both of those ends could be attained just as well by leaving them in possession while the questions were being determined.  And being the unquestioned owners of an undivided one-half interest  and having been in unchallenged possession for more than seventeen years, are they not entitled, under every principle of justice and  equity,  to remain in possession until superior rights are shown?   I again put the question, Why should  the administratrix take this property?  The only possible answer is, \"Just to give it back again after she has fattened her fees at the expense of  rights which should never have been disturbed.\"  It is the old refrain of marching up the hill and marching  down again.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> Because so far as this  action is concerned, it destroys the owners' rights in the property in question depriving them  of legal  virtue and effect and making them go for nought.   Their admitted  ownership of an undivided half, their undisturbed possession for seventeen years, are given no effect, are accorded no legal virtue and go for nothing. In spite of these conceded rights, this decision strips them as naked as the veriest squatter.  While such deprivation of rights may be limited in time, it is nevertheless a deprivation.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> Because the only evidence  presented in the case by the plaintiff to show the right  which she asserts is the  order appointing her administratrix.   There is no other evidence in the  case  on  that subject.   The only proof which the administratrix offers to sustain her alleged rights is her naked appointment.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> Because it lays down the doctrine, which I regard as a most unfortunate one, that the right of an administrator to the  possession of the real estate of a decedent is <em>general and absolute<\/em> and not special and relative; and this  court by this decision now and for the future drives absolute and conceded owners from the possession  of their lands <em>on the mere proof of  the appointment of an administrator,<\/em>  without showing the  existence of the special conditions  upon which, in my judgment, the  rights of an administrator in      real estate depend.  This doctrine, enunciated so generally in this case, and,no other interpretation can be given to the decision, is not founded in the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure  and is  not  supported, so far as I can ascertain,  by a single Anglo-Saxon authority.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> Because it makes the administrator the representative of one heir as against another, thereby seriously misapprehending the  nature  and  purpose of administration and  the functions of  an  administrator.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li>.  Because the decision holds that before anyone has any title or right to property whatever  under the law of these Islands it must go to the administrator and be administered by him, and then passed through the court in the proceedings for division; <em>that  before property belongs to an heir or devisee and before he has any right to it whatever,<\/em> it must go through the weary and expensive length of administration; that, although his ownership is admitted by  everybody, and  although  there  are no claims  for  or against the estate and no reason exists  why an administrator should be appointed, yet the property is, nevertheless, taken  from him, he is dispossessed of the use and occupation thereof, it  is placed in a useless administration, and it is  returned to him,  after  perhaps years, reduced  by useless expense and the fees of the administrator.  During all this time the administrator is promoting litigation.  If the heir in possession believes that, in justice, he  ought not to be driven out except  by  superior rights, and accordingly refuses to vacate, there must be a suit to put him out. Then there must be another to determine whether he is the son of his father or not and whether his father and mother were  married.  There  must  be still  another  hearing  to ascertain what his share in the property  is.   And all this, although every one of these facts thus determined may  be and generally is admitted by everybody.   In this very case no one questions the rights of  Eulogio and his son.  Yet out they go.   The court says:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Until this time comes (until an administrator has been appointed,  the property taken away from the real owners, placed in court, the  heirs and their shares determined, and final order made for distribution), therefore, it cannot be determined which is the property or which the part thereof that belongs to the intestate estate of Francisca Pena, and until such time there is no property <em>belonging <\/em>to Francisca Pena or to Gavina Fernandez, but only property <em>belonging<\/em> to the intestate estate of Pedro Pena.<\/p>\n<p>\"To assert rights of ownership and possession in favor of Francisca Pena before determining what the property, is which  <em>may<\/em> fall to her from the estate  of Pedro  Pena seems to be a plain absurdity that does not require demonstration, just as there is no need for demonstrating that an effect cannot precede its  cause.  Francisca  Pena  and Gavina Fernandez  are  the successors in interest of the estate of Pedro Pena, their predecessor  in interest,  and Francisca Pena can hardly have private  property derived  from Pedro  Pena's  estate before such estate has been divided and before Francisca Pena and Gavina Fernandez have been legally assigned their respective portions.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The  opinion also  says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In conformity  with these provisions  and in accordance with general principles of law, the plaintiff, Gavina  Fernandez, as administratrix of the estate of Pedro Pena, has been able to say justly in her complaint that the hereditary succession of this deceased is the owner and is entitled to ownership and possession  of the property,  which  is withheld by the defendant, Eulogio  Tria.  *  * *.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I regard the  doctrine laid  down  in these quotations to be  contrary to  the  proposition as already established  by this court in several decisions.   I am of the opinion also that it is  contrary to the  provisions of the  Civil Code and the decisions of  the  supreme court of Spain.  Articles 657, 658 and 661 of  the  Civil  Code read as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The rights to the succession of a person are transmitted from the  moment of his  death.<\/p>\n<p>\"Succession is granted  either by the will of the man as expressed in a will or, in  its absence,  by provision of law.<\/p>\n<p>\"The first is called testamentary^ the second legal succession.<\/p>\n<p>\"It may also be bestowed partly by will of man and partly by provision of  law.<\/p>\n<p>\"Heirs succeed the deceased in all  his rights, and obligations  by the mere fact of his death.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In a decision of the supreme court of Spain dated November 23, 1903, the court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"As has  been  repeatedly decided by this supreme court, the heir, as the  successor of the deceased in  all his rights and,obligations, has  the  power  and  the.right  to  demand what  pertains to his interest, without reference to his co-heirs, whenever it is not to their prejudice and  provided that he conforms to the laws regulating community of property.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In another decision dated December 11 of the same year the court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is an ancient rule of our law, confirmed by article 661 of the Civil Code, that the heirs succeed by the mere fact of the death of  their predecessor in  interest.\"<\/p>\n<p>In  the case of Pascual <em>vs.<\/em>  Angeles (4 Phil.  Rep., 604) the court said: <br\/>\n<br\/>\n  \"If the juridical personality of the deceased  testatrix is transmitted to the heir and the latter  is considered as identified with his devisor, to whose rights, actions,  and obligations,  not  extinguished by  her death,  he succeeded,  then there is no doubt that the plaintiff, as testamentary successor of his deceased sister Ciriaca, as  appears  from the will on page 17 of the  bill of exceptions, had a right to.oust the defendant,  Angeles,  for failure to pay the stipulated rent. (Art. 659 of the Civil Code; judgments of the supreme court of Spain of February 10, 1879; September 13, 1882; and January 28, 1892.)\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the case of Ilustre, as administrator, <em>vs.<\/em> Frondosa (17 Phil.  Rep., 321), this court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Under the provisions of the Civil  Code (arts. 657-661), the rights  to the succession of  a person are transmitted from  the moment of his  death; in other words, the heirs succeeded immediately to all of the property of the deceased ancestor.   The property belongs to the heirs at the moment of the death of the ancestor as completely as if the ancestor had executed  and delivered to them a deed for the same before his  death.  In the absence of debts existing against the estate, the heirs may enter upon the  administration of the said property immediately.  If they desire to administer it jointly,  they  may do  so.  If they desire  to partition  it among themselves  and can do this  by mutual  agreement, they also have that privilege.  The Code of Procedure in Civil Actions  provides how  an estate may  be  divided  by a petition for  partition in case they can not mutually agree in the division.   When there are no debts existing against the estate, there is certainly no occasion for the intervention of an administrator in the settlement and partition of the estate among  the heirs.  When  the  heirs are all  of lawful age and there are no debts, there is no reason why the estate should  be burdened with the costs and expenses of an  administrator.  The  property belonging absolutely to the heirs, in the absence of existing debts against the estate, the administrator has no  right  to intervene in any way whatever  in the division of the  estate among the  heirs. *  *  *   If there are any heirs of the estate who have not received  their participation,  they have  their remedy  by petition for partition of  the said estate.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the case  of Malahacan, as administrator, <em>vs.<\/em> Ignacio and others (19  Phil. Rep., 434), this  court  cited with approval the case just quoted from and said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The action is brought by Simon Malahacan as administrator of the goods, chattels, and credits of Guillerma Martinez, deceased,  against the  defendants, the  only  heirs  at law of the said  deceased, to recover possession of the real estate of which the said Guillerma Martinez died  seized, which said real estate the defendants had been occupying for some years  before the  commencement of this action.<\/p>\n<p>\"Under the  provisions of the Civil Code the  ownership of real estate passes to the heirs of the owner instantly on his death.  Guillerma  Martinez, having died seized of  the lands  involved  in this suit,  leaving the  defendants  as her  only heirs at law, it follows that said  heirs instantly became the  owners  and were entitled to  the  immediate possession thereof.  It is not alleged  in the complaint nor does it appear from the record or the evidence in this case that there were debts outstanding against Guillerma Martinez at the time of her death.   The only ground upon which an administrator  can demand of the heirs  at law possession of the real  estate of which his  intestate  died seized is that such land will be required to be sold to pay the debts of the deceased.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>To the same effect is the case of  Irlanda vs. Pitargue (22 Phil. Rep., 383).<\/p>\n<p>In the case of McMicking <em>vs.<\/em> Sy Conbieng  (21 Phil. Rep., 211), this  court held:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is the undisputed policy of every people which maintains the  principle of private  ownership of property that he who owns property shall  not be deprived  of its  immediate possession and use except for urgent and imperative  reasons; and then only so long and to such extent as is necessary to make the  opposing rights  which  underlie those reasons effective.  This being so, said sections, which have for their object the prompt possession and use of property by the  persons who  really own it, should  be given liberal construction.   They  should  not  be  unreasonably straitened or narrowed in  their extent, but, rather, should be given that wideness and fullness of application without which they cannot produce their most beneficial effects.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In relation to sections 596 and 597 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court  held in  said case:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The purpose of these sections being, also, to avoid the trouble, loss of time,  expense, and other undesirable  concomitants of administration,  such construction  should  be given as will  best conserve this purpose.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li> Because  the  administrator  against   whom it  is rendered was not in possession of the land in dispute when the judgment was rendered and  has never been  in possession.  On the contrary it is the inevitable conclusion from the whole case that Eulogio Tria and his minor son are in possession as heirs of Francisca Pena and have been without dispute  or challenge since 1902.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> Because the court found as a fact in another part of the same decision that the  administration proceedings  on the estate of Francisca Pena, wife of Eulogio, terminated in 1903.   This being so, the administrator of that estate could  not have  been  in  possession when  this action was commenced, and cannot be now.   Therefore the basic allegation in ejectment, viz, the  possession of the  defendant, is unproved in this case.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> Because the actual owners of the land in suit, two of whom were also in actual  possession when this action was commenced and are now in possession, are not parties in  this action.  Not  one of the actual  owners is a party to  this suit although  two of them  and  their  predecessors in interest have been continuously in possession since 1890.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> Because no steps were taken by  the court below  or by this court to  protect the interests of a  minor in actual possession of the real estate in litigation in this suit.   If the  judgment  rendered  by this  court  in this case  is not fruitless,  it will  dispossess  Eulogio and his minor  son by excluding Eulogio as administrator,  the court having found that he is in partial possession as  such.  It is undoubted that the court below will, on the judgment of this court,  at once order the plaintiff put in possession to the exclusion  of everybody else.  This will dispossess  the minor  son with his father, when it is indisputable  that  they  together are the real possessors and not the administrator.  Under such conditions the  court should  take measures to. protect the minor. <br\/>\n<br\/>\n<\/li>\n<li> Because  the evidence  produced  by the plaintiff  is <em>legally worthless<\/em> for any  purpose except to strengthen the defendants' case  and the decision has,  therefore, nothing to sustain it.  The possession of the father and son  is <em>not<\/em> illegal  or  unlawful.  It is not subordinate  to  anyone else.       Their rights are not inferior  to those of any other person, especially the  plaintiff.  No  one in  the world,  so  far  as this  record  shows, has higher or more perfect legal  rights than they.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>",

FLORA CHOCO Y REYES ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On January 31, 1906, Flora Choco and her sister Severina applied to the Court of Land Registration for the registration of and issuance of title to a parcel of land situated in the district of Tondo. <p>The owners of the conterminous lands were, among others, cited to appear. One of these was Clemente Manotoc, who did not enter an appearance on the date of the hearing and did not file any objection.<\/p> <p>On the 30th of June following, the adjudication and registration of the property was decreed in behalf of the applicants.<\/p> <p>Nothing further was done until December 5, 1908, when the applicants filed a petition to have the court surveyor verify the land in accordance with the plan they had presented, in order to determine its true boundaries on the side adjoining the lot of Clemente Manotoc; they further prayed that the sheriff place them in possession of the surveyed land, cleared of all the buildings thereon belonging to others, \"for it is made of record,\" the applicants say, \"that the said buildings already stood in the place where they now are, even before the commencement of these proceedings, and if the owners thereof have not been included as occupants in the summons, it is due to the fact that the applicants did not then know how far the true and correct boundaries of their land extended on the side adjacent to the property of Clemente Manotoc.\"<\/p> <p>The Court of Land Registration at once granted all the requests made in the aforesaid petition.<\/p> <p>On January 6, 1909, the surveyor of the Land Court, without serving notice on anyone, verified and marked the land by placing monuments.<\/p> <p>On the same day, January 6, 1909, Clemente Manotoc came into court and moved that the applicants be cited to appear and that the execution of judgment be suspended for the purpose of correcting the boundaries of both properties, as a part of his land had been included therein. This motion was denied, because it was made out of time and not, as prescribed by section 38 of Act No. 496, within the period of one year.<\/p> <p>After the termination of the proceedings and after Clemente Manotoc had been deprived of a part of his land and even of a part of his <em>bodega<\/em> or warehouse, as a result of the survey made two years subsequent to the entry of the decree of registration, he brought an action in the Court of First Instance of Manila to recover damages for loss of his ownership. This is the question to be decided now, in this new action. It did not come up in the case before the Court of Land Registration; that case was already terminated.<\/p> <p>These proceedings were brought against the applicants, Flora and Severina Choco, and subsidiarily against the Insular Treasurer for recovery from the assurance fund provided for in the Land Registration Act; but the plaintiff subsequently withdrew his action against the Insular Treasurer and continued it solely against the applicants, who are now the only defendants in this suit.<\/p> <p>This action is brought to recover the value of three parcels of land that were taken away from Clemente Manotoc; parcels that were well determined by an expert surveyor, without contradiction, and are: (<em>a<\/em>) a strip measuring 49.27 sq. meters; (<em>b<\/em>) another of 10.88 square meters; and (<em>c<\/em>) another of 13.92 square meters, valued, all together, at P1,500. The action also includes the values of several light material buildings that stood on the parcels (<em>a<\/em>) and (<em>c<\/em>) and which are worth P137.<\/p> <p>It appears that the parcel (<em>b<\/em>), of 10.84 square meters, is within, and forms a part of the floor of a rubble-stone <em>bodega<\/em> belonging to Clemente Manotoc. The part of the building that covers this parcel (<em>b<\/em>) is valued at P183, and the land itself, (<em>b<\/em>), at P21.76<\/p> <p>The conclusions of the lower court are:<\/p> <p>First. With respect to the portions (<em>a<\/em>) and (<em>c<\/em>), that the applicants did not act fraudulently in including them in their plan and having them included in their title. The court therefore disallowed that part of the complaint.<\/p> <p>Second. With respect to parcel (<em>b<\/em>) covered by a part of Clemente Manotoc's said warehouse, that the applicants did act fraudulently. The trial court said:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"Flora Choco herself, a widow 40 years of age, admits that that <em>bodega,<\/em> as it now stands and was seen by the court when he made the ocular inspection on the 30th of last July (1910) belonged, and does now belong to Clemente Manotoc, and has been in his possession ever since she can remember, and that, if she included the land occupied by a part of that bodega, it was simply because during the last few days just prior to having the plan of her lot made, she was told by certain persons, whom she does not even name, that the boundaries of the lot that had belonged to her parents extended that far. She had no other reason whatever for including that portion and she made it notwithstanding her personal knowledge that, ever since she was able to remember, Clemente Manotoc had been in the quiet possession of the said land, and that, in the absence of other muniments of title, such possession was sufficient to constitute for him an unquestionable mode of acquisition of the property by prescription.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>Third. That the applicants did not act fraudulently with respect to the light-material buildings either. The court therefore disallowed that part of the complaint.<\/p> <p>It therefore appears that the court in his judgment allows damages only for the appropriation of parcel (<em>b<\/em>), and he ordered the defendants to pay to the plaintiff P204.76, with legal interest thereon from the date of the filing of the complaint, without special finding as to the costs.<\/p> <p>Both parties appealed from the judgment.<\/p> <p>The defendants, Flora and Severina Choco, on appeal to this court, make but one assignment of error. They allege that the court erred in finding that the inclusion in their application for registration, of a portion of land 10.88 square meters in area, together with the part of the <em>bodega<\/em> standing thereon, was fraudulent, and that consequently it was error to order them to pay P204.76 as damages, together with legal interest thereon from the date of the filing of the complaint. (Brief, p. 2.)<\/p> <p>The following facts are relevant to this question:<\/p> <ol><li>That parcel (<em>b<\/em>), comprising nearly one-third of the area of Clemente Manotoc's lot and warehouse, and which, as stated in the judgment, was included in the property title obtained by the appellants, is older than its present owner, Clemente Manotoc, who is 66 years of age, for the reason that he inherited it from his father. This fact is confirmed by the appellant Flora Choco, who testified that she was 40 years old and that she had known that the said lot and warehouse belonged to Clemente Manotoc ever since she could remember. <p><\/p><\/li><li>The petition of the Choco sisters in no manner includes the warehouse or building on that parcel (<em>b<\/em>), and at first sight it would hardly be noticed that it includes one-third of the lot on which the warehouse stands. Only after the proceedings were terminated and when the Choco sisters requested that their land be surveyed, did landmarks appear as bounding that one-third of the lot and warehouse of Clemente Manotoc as though it ought to have been included in the application, and only then was Clemente Manotoc able to make his objection.<p><\/p> <p><\/p><\/li><li>According to unchallenged testimony of the expert surveyor, Tomas Arguelles, it was impossible by an inspection of the plan which the applicants attached to their application to ascertain that it was intended to include that part of the lot and warehouse belonging to Clement Manotoc. This witness said: \"Here nothing is seen but lines, and Manotoc's warehouse is shown. Nothing but lines; it does not say whether there is a wall or not.\" The plaintiff, Manotoc, testified that he did not appear at the hearing before the Court of Land Registration, because he did not believe that the applicants could go beyond the walls which bounded his land.<p><\/p> <p><\/p><\/li><li>According to the same expert witness, the entire area of the warehouse floor is 35.64 square meters. So that the 10.88 square meters included within the landmarks located after the award of the decree of registration, form nearly a third of the warehouse floor, as stated in the judgment appealed from.<p><\/p> <p><\/p><\/li><li>The 10.88 square meters of ground are valued at P21.76, and the part of the warehouse covering these 10.88 square meters is valued at P183.<\/li><\/ol><p><\/p> <p>From these facts it appears:<\/p> <p>First. That, if the application does not in any way include that part of the building which is on parcel (<em>b<\/em>), neither is it included in the title; and, therefore, it cannot be said that the plaintiff, Manotoc, has lost any part of his warehouse or building; consequently, not having lost it, he cannot claim damages for such supposed loss; for the law does not permit such relief except to the \"person aggrieved by the decree of registration.\" (Act No. 496, sec. 38.)<\/p> <p>Second. That the appellants say in their brief on appeal, that \"the trial judge himself admits in his judgment that the defendants performed no act tending to demolish that nearly one-third part of Clemente Manotoc's warehouse, which covers an area of 10.88 square meters, no visible alteration having been made therein, the whole of it (the warehouse) being reserved for the enjoyment of the said Manotoc.\" To which the court adds: \"And even without the said sisters having taken any steps, or made any demand upon Clemente Manotoc, with regard to vacating the said parcel of the lot occupied by nearly one-third of his warehouse.\" (B. of Ex., p. 26.) But defendants could not, in law or in justice, demand that plaintiff vacate that parcel, nor that he demolish any part of his warehouse, even in the event that any part of the building had been comprised within the boundaries fixed by the said surveyor, as Manotoc did not in bad faith build on another's land, for Flora Choco admitted that, ever since she could remember, she had known that the land in question belonged to Clemente Manotoc. It ceased to be his only by the irrevocable force of the decree of adjudication of the Court of Land Registration, although it was illegally lost to its legitimate owner by reason of it having been included in the applicants' title in the manner stated in the recital of the facts.<\/p> <p>Third. That if, by the placing of landmarks to include a part of the warehouse floor, plaintiff has not lost any part of his warehouse, since he has a right to maintain his building entire on the part of the ground that he has now recently lost and that has passed into the applicants' possession in an unlawful manner, as he falls within the provisions of article 361 of the Civil Code, it is not yet proper and it would be out of place prematurely to decree that the defendant-appellants must pay to the plaintiff-appellee P153 as damages, as if the former, by the irrevocable force of the decree of adjudication of the Court of Land Registration, had become the owners of a part of Clemente Manotoc's building or warehouse, merely because they had become the owners of the ground on which that building or warehouse stands.<\/p> <ol type=\"A\"><li>By virtue of the foregoing facts the judgment appealed from is reversed in so far as it sentences the defendants, Flora and Severina Choco, to pay to Clemente Manotoc <em>P183,<\/em> the value of nearly one-third of the warehouse, which is the plaintiff's exclusive property. <p><\/p><\/li><li>The judgment appealed from is affirmed in so far as it sentences the defendants, Flora and Severina Choco, to pay to Clemente Manotoc, <em>P21.76,<\/em> the value, at the rate of P2 a square meter, of the 10.88 square meters of ground occupied by the said part of the warehouse, with legal interest on this amount from the date of the filing of the complaint; without special finding as to the costs of first instance.<p><\/p> <p>The conclusions of law upon which these pronouncements are based, are the following:<\/p> <p>First. If it had clearly appeared in the plan which accompanied the application filed with the Court of Land Registration, that the 10.88 square meters of ground situated within the walls of Clemente Manotoc's warehouse were included in the land applied for, plaintiff, by his failure to appear and object to such inclusion, would now have no right of action for damages for the loss of that portion of his property. Section 101 of Act No. 496 grants such right of action to \"any person who, without negligence on his part, is wrongfully deprived of any land * * * by the registration of any other person as the owner of such land;\" and, on this hypothesis, Manotoc would have been deprived of that part of his land by the fact of Flora and Severina Choco having been registered as the owners thereof, and he would have no right to any indemnity, because, through his negligence in failing to appear at the trial, he failed to see that his property was manifestly being taken from him.<\/p> <p>Second. But, as the said inclusion does not plainly appear on the plan, according to the testimony of the expert, Tomas Arguelles, for nothing but lines are to be seen therein and none of the warehouse walls are shown, even though plaintiff had appeared at the hearing, he would not have been able to understand that the said part of his property was being taken from him, nor would he have filed an opposition; only upon the making of the survey by the aforesaid surveyor, would he have noticed, as only then he did notice, that landmarks were being placed and that these took in 10.88 square meters of his land which were protected by the walls of his warehouse; then of course an occasion and opportunity would have been offered him to appear before the Court of Land Registration in defense of his property that was being improperly included in the survey, had the survey been made within the year following the date of the decree of registration in accordance with the provisions of section 38 of the said Act No. 496. But the decree of registration was issued, as aforestated, on January 30, 1906, and applicants' petition for the survey of their land was not made until December 5, <em>1908<\/em>. No notification of this petition was served on Clemente Manotoc, notwithstanding that the motion recited that its purpose was \"to determine the true boundaries of the same in the part thereof lying adjacent to the land of Clemente Manotoc.\" After the year had elapsed, Manotoc could not effectively appear in the proceedings before the Court of Land Registration \"to pray for the review thereof,\" as authorized by said section 38; but he did appear, in order that it might not be claimed that he was negligent, and that which was bound to occur, occurred, to wit, the year having elapsed, his petition for review could not be allowed, and it was not allowed. The case was completely terminated; the inclusion of that part of Clemente Manotoc's lot was consummated without negligence whatsoever on his part and without his being notified of the survey. No motion for this purpose was made by the applicants until they had allowed two years and a half to elapse, and now in this action one of them admits that, ever since she could remember, she knew that that lot belonged to Clemente Manotoc.<\/p> <p>Third. It is possible that, in view of our conclusions, the applicants may not desire to take advantage of the efficacy and irrevocable nature of their registered title, by virtue whereof they have gained the ownership of the 10.88 square meters of land occupied by a part of appellee's warehouse. On page 6 of their brief, they say: \"Plaintiff, then, not having been deprived of the enjoyment and possession of his land and building, we see no reason why he should be awarded damages.\" Construing these words in their legal sense, to wit, that the plaintiff has not actually been deprived of his land and building by the title secured by applicants from the Court of Land Registration, and as this statement was made during the trial, it is obvious that there is no reason why plaintiff should be awarded damages; the reason for indemnity of this sort is the unjust loss of property by an effective and irrevocable entry in the property registry, and if the property has not been lost, the judgment awarding the indemnity should be reversed. But if these words are to be understood in the sense that appellants, in spite of this effective and irrevocable entry in the registry, do not intend to molest appellee in the enjoyment and possession of his property, then the judgment appealed from ought not to be reversed, as such an intention is not a judicial act; and, it having been decided in the proceedings in the Court of Land Registration that the strip of land, indicated by the landmarks which take in 10.88 square meters of the ground on which appellee's warehouse stands, is now the property of the appellants on account of its being included, though improperly, but irremediably, in their property title, the judgment awarding the said indemnity is in harmony with the provisions of section 101 of Act No. 496; however, by private agreement, the right and the obligation, likewise established in other judicial decisions, may be left unexercised and unfulfilled.<\/p> <p>As regards the two parcels (<em>a<\/em>) and (<em>c<\/em>), of 49.27 and 13.92 square meters in area, respectively, the facts relating thereto are those given above and in addition, the following:<\/p> <ol><li>That a part of the evidence presented by plaintiff consists of a rough sketch which defendants attached to their declaration relative to the assessment of the land in question. Therein the parcel (<em>a<\/em>) is shown to have an area of only 39.08 square meters, and the parcel (<em>c<\/em>), that of only 8.36 square meters. So that both of them together, totalling 47.44 square meters, do not even equal the actual area of the parcel (<em>a<\/em>), which is 49.27 square meters. <p><\/p><\/li><li>That in the petitioners' first plan, the land for which they obtained title had a total measurement of 1,777.299 square meters; but an amendment of that plan having been ordered, the land was found to contain 1,772.189 square meters, and this will be the fixed area which will appear in the title, if no further rectification has been made. But in the possessory information title presented by applicants, the larger parcel is shown to contain 873.41 square meters, and the lesser one, according to its title, 73.35 square meters, or a total area of 946.76 square meters for both parcels.

However, the said expert surveyor, Tomas Arguelles, found that the landmarks placed by the Court of Land Registration taking in 74.07 square meters of Manotoc's property were outside of those walls; that the parcel (<em>a<\/em>) as aforesaid, contains 49.27 square meters and is worth P2 per meter, and the parcel (<em>c<\/em>), 13.92 square meters, is worth P4 per meter.

And, notwithstanding that the petitioners did not know these boundaries at the time of the trial yet, two years and a half after the termination of the case they obtained those parcels (<em>a<\/em>) and (<em>c<\/em>) and ejected therefrom the tenants who, for those buildings, paid rental to Clemente Manotoc, and petitioners had themselves registered as the owners of the said two parcels (<em>a<\/em>) and (<em>c<\/em>).<\/p> <p>The judgment appealed from is modified and the record will be returned to the lower court with instructions to render a new judgment in conformity with this decision.

The complaint is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The  undersigned, husband of Maria Asuncion, accuses the said  Maria Asuncion  of the crime  of adultery,  committed as follows: <\/p>\n<p>\"That on  or about or between October 23,1910, and October 27, 1910,  in the city of Manila,  Philippine Islands, the said Maria  Asuncion, being the lawful  wife of the  complainant, Carlos de  Lalinde,  did  willfully,  illegally, and                 criminally, lie with a man who is not her husband, to wit, with one R. L, Larson, who lay with her not knowing that she was a married woman.   In violation of law.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>To this complaint counsel for the defendant filed  a demurrer on the ground that it was fatally defective under the provisions of article 434 of the Penal  Code, in that  it did not  include the wife's paramour as a party defendant together with the wife.<\/p>\n<p>The trial  court overruled  the demurrer  and but two witnesses were called,  the  husband of the accused and  a policeman.  The defense offered no evidence and declined to cross-examine the witnesses  for  the prosecution, there having been an  agreement of counsel whereby  only such evidence was  offered by the prosecution  as was necessary to  prove the  essential  facts charged  in  the  complaint, it being understood that the real  question sought to be raised by the defense was the one of law presented by the demurrer.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of U. S.  <em>vs.<\/em> Bacas (14  Phil. Rep., 308), we held that Act No. 1773 does not repeal  the  provisions of article 434.   That  article is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"No penalty shall be imposed for the crime of adultery, except upon a complaint  filed  by the  injured husband.<\/p>\n<p>\"The husband can not institute a  prosecution without including therein both the guilty parties,  if they are  both alive, nor in  any case, if he shall have  consented  to the adultery or pardoned either  of the adulterers.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The contention of the prosecution is that  while  article 434  has  not  been  repealed  and is  still in force with the modification that the crime  of adultery has  been made a public  crime instead of a private one, and can no  longer be pardoned or condoned by the offended party as provided in article 434 of the code;  nevertheless the provisions of article 434 are not applicable to a case where the paramour did not know  the woman to be married.   It  is contended that since the  paramour is not  guilty of the crime of adultery under the provisions of article 433 unless it is  shown that he knew  the woman to  be married, it could not have been the intention of the lawmaker to require the injured husband to file a complaint against the paramour in a case where the paramour did not know of the existence of the marriage, and was not  therefore guilty  of  the crime of adultery.<\/p>\n<p>Reading all these articles and their amendments together, however, we conclude  that the intention of the lawmaker was to deny to the husband the right to prefer a complaint against either the wife or her paramour without including the other therein.  To hold  otherwise would  be to give to the husband the right or  at any rate the power in all cases to condone the offense of the paramour and at the same time to secure tije conviction of his wife; for to secure this end it would only be necessary for the husband to omit from his complaint an allegation that  the paramour knew  of the existence of his marriage with the woman, or,  as in the case at bar, to insert an allegation that the paramour did not know of the existence of the marriage, in order to relieve him from liability  of conviction and punishment, It is not  for the husband to  determine the question of  the guilt or innocence of the paramour of the crime of adultery; that question must be left to the court.  It may be that the complaint having been duly filed, and the control of the proceedings having thereby been placed in the hand3 of the prosecuting officer, he  might move for a dismissal of the complaint as to the paramour if  he were satisfied that he could  not establish guilty  knowledge  on  his part.  But however this may be, we think that the language of article 434 of the code  clearly contemplates the inclusion by the husband of both the wife and her paramour,  if they are both alive, in  the  complaint  upon which he institutes a prosecution for the crime  of  adultery.<\/p>\n<p>The jurisdiction of the court below to hear and determine; a charge of this nature being dependent upon the filing oi a  complaint  by the husband, and  the husband being expressly prohibited  from  the  filing of  such a  complaint against one of the parties without including therein the other,  we  are  of opinion that the demurrer filed in the court below should have been sustained.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of conviction and sentence imposed by the trial court are reversed, with the costs of both  instances <em>de oficio<\/em>.  The appellant will be set at liberty forthwith and the complaint dismissed.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

The complaint alleged:<br\/><blockquote>\"That on or about May 13, 1911, in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, the said Lio Team did, willfully, illegally, and criminally, smoke and take opium into his own body, not for medicinal purposes nor by prescription of a duly licensed practicing physician.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable Richard Campbell, judge, in his decision, made the following statement:<br\/><blockquote>\"Excluding from all consideration in connection with that case, the testimony of Dr. Goff, who appeared for the prosecution, I am of the opinion that the confession of the accused made to Mr. Armstrong, of the Internal Revenue Bureau, on the night in question, immediately after the arrest, taken together with the other proofs relative to the character of the house where the arrest took place and which was raided on the night in question, is sufficient to convict the accused of the crime charged.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>And upon these facts he sentenced the defendant to be imprisoned for a period of four months and to pay the costs. The lower court ordered that the apparatus seized at the time of the arrest of the defendant be forfeited.<br\/><br\/>From that sentence the defendant appealed and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote> \"I. The court erred in holding that the alleged statements made to the internal revenue agent, Mr. Armstrong, were made as a confession.<br\/><br\/>\"II. The court erred in holding that the evidence was sufficient to prove a confession.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>With reference to the first assignment of error, the question is presented whether or not the statements made by the defendant to the witness Armstrong, amounted to a confession of guilt of the crime charged against him. The witness Armstrong testified that he had a conversation with the defendant at or about the time of the arrest. That conversation was as follows:<br\/><blockquote> \"I asked him if it was true that he was there smoking opium, and he said it was. I asked him if it was true that he was smoking opium when I commenced to knock on the door, and he said it was. I asked him where the opium was and he laughed and said, 'Find it you will never find it if you look a week.' I asked him if he knew where it was hidden, and he said he did not; that the only people who knew, were the people in charge of the den. I asked him if he did not smoke when I was beating on the door and he said yes. He said, when we knocked, all the people came downstairs, and the people in charge of the place hid the opium and the pipes.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The witness Armstrong testified that no force whatever was used against the defendant and that no promises of reward of any character were made to him.<br\/><br\/>The defendant was charged with the crime of smoking and using opium. The evidence shows that the place in which the defendant and the others were arrested was a place frequented by Chinamen for the purpose of smoking opium. In view of the crime charged in the complaint and the statements made by the defendant to the witness Armstrong, the question is, Did such statements amount to a confession of the crime charged? A confession may be defined as an acknowledgment in express words, by the accused in a criminal case, of the truth of the main fact charged, or of some essential part thereof. (Wigmore on Evidence, vol 1, sec. 821.) The complaint charged that the defendant smoked opium. The statement of the defendant to the witness Armstrong, was that he had been smoking opium. It would seem, therefore, that the confession or statement made by the defendant falls clearly within the general definition of what a confession is. The statements made by the defendant, amounting to a confession, were they sufficient upon which to base a conviction, under the law? We think they were.<br\/><br\/>Where a crime has been committed, the admissions of a party charged with the crime, deliberately made, are always admissible for the purpose of showing the guilt of the accused. (Andrews vs. People, 117 111., 195; U. S. vs. Castillo et al., 2 Phil. Rep., 17; U. S. vs. De la Cruz et al., 2 Phil. Rep., 148; U. S. vs. Pascual et al.1, 2 Phil. Rep., 457.)<br\/><br\/>It appears that the statements made by the defendant with reference to his smoking opium, had been made freely.and not under the influence of fear or other improper inducements.<br\/><br\/>The appellant in this court alleges that the statements made by him to the officer Armstrong were made in jest-that he was joking. The appellant took the witness stand in his own behalf in the court below. He then denied that he made any statements at all to the officer relating to the fact that he had been smoking opium. No pretense was made in the lower court that his statements were made in jest.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the statements made by the defendant to the officer at the time of the arrest, the record fairly bristles with indications showing that the defendant and his companions, at the time and place of the arrest, had been smoking opium. There were twelve or fifteen Chinamen in the house where the defendant was arrested. The house in which the defendant and his companions were was thoroughly barricaded. The front door leading to the house was a heavy door, composed of two or three thicknesses of board, covered inside and out with sheet iron. Through this door there were a number of peep-holes, the larger ones being covered by a small piece or slide on the inside. The house was wired with electric bells, so that a person, inside the room barricaded by that heavy door, might, by push-buttons, give the alarm to the persons about the house. Each of the witnesses testified, that, when they entered the room, after gaining admission with much difficulty, they found that the air in the.room was laden with a very strong smell of opium smoke. A small portion of opium was found upon the table. An opium lamp was also found in the room.<br\/><br\/>Confessions of guilt should always be scrutinized carefully. Courts should be slow to accept them. They should be weighed with the greatest care in relation to all of the facts and circumstances presented in the evidence. In the present case we have no hesitation whatever, in view of all of the facts contained in the record, in finding the defendant guilty of the crime charged, in view of his confession. The sentence of the lower court is, therefore, hereby affirmed, with costs. So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur. <\/div>",

In other words, the judge is required to restate the facts and exceptions where there is an actual controversy between the parties and when he is required to decide what actually iook place during the trial.<p> It is said that the judge declined to approve the proposed bill of exceptions in this case on the ground that the transcript of the stenographer's notes was not united with the said bill.\u00a0 On examination of the order above copied it will &amp; noted that the bill was disapproved on the ground that it did not contain a correct copy of the judgment or findings of fact.\u00a0 This is specifically stated in the first paragraph of the order.\u00a0 It is true that it is\u00a0 stated\u00a0 in the second paragraph that no transcript of the testimony accompanied the alleged bill of exceptions, and of course this would not be a sufficient reason to justify the respondent in failing to approve the proposed bill.\u00a0 But the respondent in his answer states that he has\u00a0 at all\u00a0 times been ready and willing to certify the bill of exceptions whenever it contained a correct copy of the judgment and orders. Counsel for the petitioner states that it was impossible for\u00a0 him to present a correct copy of the judgment for the reason that it had not been translated into the Spanish language, but he does not state that he\u00a0 requested the court to direct its officials to furnish him a translation of this judgment.\u00a0 Had he done so, no doubt the respondent would have immediately directed a translation made.\u00a0 When the bill of exceptions\u00a0 is presented to the\u00a0 respondent in due form, it will no doubt be signed ; but the\u00a0 respondent was perfectly\u00a0 justified in refusin to approve the proposed bill of exceptions presented,\" on\u00a0 the ground that it did not\u00a0 contain a correct copy of the judgement.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>For the foregoing reasons, judgment is rendered in favor of the respondent, dismissing the petition, with costs against the petitioner.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><em>Arellano, C, J., Towes, Mapa, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ. <\/em>concur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

Cruz; on the south by a road from the barrio of San Miguel; and on the west by the land of Eugenia de Jesus. It has an area of 222,871.23 square meters.<br\/><br\/>Parcel B, bounded on the north by the road from the barrio of San Miguel; on the east by the land of Victoria A. Cruz; on the south by the Rio Grande de Calumpit; and on the west by the land of Eugenia de Jesus. It has an area of 14,130.67 square meters. The estate described, composed of two parcels of land, was appraised, for the purposes of the last assessment, together with the buildings thereon constructed.<br\/><br\/>The petitioners alleged that there was no encumbrance on the property, nor any person entitled to any right or share therein, according to their best knowledge and belief; that they acquired this land by inheritance from their deceased parents, Jose Arnedo Cruz and Maria Santos Espiritu; and that, in the unlikely event of its being impossible to grant their application in accordance with the Land Registration Act, they would rely upon the benefits of chapter 6 of Act No. 926, inasmuch as they had been in possession of the said lands for more than fifty years, during which period they were used for the cultivation of rice, being surrounded by <i>pilapiles<\/i>, or earthen dikes.<br\/><br\/>Upon a hearing of the case, on February 20, 1908, the court, by an order of the same date and after the issuance of a decree of general default, decreed the adjudication and registration of the two aforedescribed properties in the names of the sisters Gregoria Arnedo Cruz, Manuela Arnedo Cruz, Maria Conception Arnedo Cruz and Juana Arnedo Cruz.<br\/><br\/>By a written petition of the date of December 15, 1908, Toribio de Leon, Agustin Catanghal, Fulgencio Clarin, Clara de Leon, Antonio Mundo, Julian de Leon, Joaquin de Leon, Domingo de Leon, Eernardo Reyes, Ambrosio Carlos, Pedro de Leon, Florentina Ramos, Monica Laderas, Juana Martinez, Francisco de Torres, and Mariano Valladar, stated to the court that they were the owners and possessors of certain building lots which formed a part of the two parcels of land concerned in this case, and that, notwithstanding the fact that the applicants knew that the said lots were held by the petitioners as owners thereof. they nevertheless included the same as their property and in their application for registration maliciously made no mention of the petitioners as the occupants of such portions of the said parcels of land, in this manner fraudulently obtaining the judgment in their favor by the Land Court on February 20, 1908; and that, because of such fraudulent procedure the petitioners had no opportunity to appear before the court at the hearing of the case to defend their rights in the portions of land which they respectively occupied. They therefore petitioned that the previous judgment of February 20 be reconsidered and reversed, after due procedure, in so far as their respective lots were concerned.<br\/><br\/>After a hearing on this motion the court, with the acquiescence of the applicants, ordered, on January 7, 1909, that the case should be reheard.<br\/><br\/>In consequence thereof, briefs were filed by the opponents and Domingo de Leon alleged: that for about eight years past he had been in possession as owner of a building lot, containing banana plants, situate in the barrio of Frances, Calumpit, Bulacan, bounded on the north by the barrio road, on the east by the property of the heirs of Antonia de Leon, on the south by the Rio Grande de la Pampanga, and on the west by the property of Toribio de Leon, containing 2,522 square meters; and that this lot was acquired by inheritance from his deceased parents, Cayetano and Fernanda Catanghal, who had possessed it as owners for a period of about forty years.<br\/><br\/>Bernardo Reyes alleged that he was in possession as owner, and had so possessed for some twenty-eight years, a building lot, containing banana plants, situate in the barrio of Frances, bounded on the north by the barrio road, on the east by the property of Toribio de Leon, on the south by the Rio Grande de la Pampanga, and on the west by the property of Isidro N. Baltazar, which lot has an area of 2,590 square meters and was acquired by him by purchase from the spouses Rafael Laderas and Aleja Mata who during their lifetime had held it as owners for more than twenty years.<br\/><br\/>Raymunda, Bernarda and Jose, all surnamed del Rosario, alleged that they were coowners of a lot situate in the barrio of Frances, bounded on the north by the property of Maria Santos, on the east by that of Pedro del Rosario, on the south by that of Florentina Reyes, and on the west by that of Pedro del Rosario, containing an area of two balitas, which lot was acquired by them through inheritance from their deceased parents, Pedro and Felipa Reyes, who had held it as owners for more than sixteen years.<br\/><br\/>Florentina Ramos alleged: that for about two years she had been in possession as owner of a lot situate in the said barrio, bounded on the north by the property of Gregoria Arnedo Cruz, on the east by that of Agustin Catanghal, on the south by the barrio road, and on the west by the property of Francisco Torres, and measuring 1,033 square meters, which lot he inherited from his deceased parents, Juan and Josefa Mundo, who themselves had inherited it from Mariano Ramos and had held it as owners for more than sixty years.<br\/><br\/>Patricio and Felisa Lumabas and Juana, Fernanda and Andres Catanghal, the three latter being minors attended by a curator <i>ad litem<\/i>, alleged that they were the coowners of two lots, one in the barrio of Frances and bounded on the north by the barrio road, on the east by the property of Julian de Leon, on the south by the Rio Grande, and on the west by the property of Mariano Valladar, containing 19 ares and 76 centares, and the other in the same barrio, bounded on the north by the property of Gregoria Arnedo Cruz, on the east by that of Victoria A.

possession as owner, and had been for more than twenty years, of a lot containing banana plants, situate in the said barrio and bounded on the north by the property of Gregoria Arnedo Cruz, on the east by that of Maria Catanghal, on the south by the barrio road, and on the west by the property of Florentina Ramos, with an area of 7 ares and 92 centares which was acquired by him through inheritance from his parents, Lucas and Adriana Hilario, who during their lifetime had held it as owners for more than thirty years.<br\/><br\/>Joaquin de Leon alleged that he was in possession as

Grande de la Pampanga, and on the west by the property of Julian de Leon, having an area of 5 ares and 31 centares, which lot he acquired by purchase from Gabriela Francisco, Mauricio and Magdalena Yambao and Isidra Torres, who themselves inherited it from their deceased parents, Feliciano and Segunda Arcillas; and that the two latter had possessed it for more than thirty years.<br\/><br\/>Ambrosio Carlos alleged that he was in possession, and had been for more than five years, of a piece of land situate in the said barrio, bounded on the north by the property of Gregoria Arnedo Cruz, on the east by that of Calixto Ramos, on the south by the barrio road, and on the west by the property of Gregoria Arnedo Cruz, and that it contains 756 square meters and was acquired by him through inheritance from his deceased mother, Antonia Ramos, who had obtained it from Marciano Ramos, and these two had possessed it during their lifetime for more than forty years.<br\/><br\/>Andres de Leon alleged that he was in possession, and had been for more than twenty years past, of a lot in the same barrio bounded on the north by the barrio road, on the east by the property of Clara de Leon, on the south by the Rio Grande, and on the west by the property of the heirs of Antonio de Leon, which lot has an area of 396 square meters and was inherited by him from his parents, Florentino and Juana Payabyab, who during their lifetime had possessed it for more than forty years.<br\/><br\/>Ignacio and Urbana Ramos, attended by a curator <i>ad litem<\/i>, on account of their being minors, alleged that they were the owners and possessors of a lot in the same barrio, bounded on the north by the property of Gregoria Arnedo Cruz, on the east by that of Florentina Ramos, on the south by the barrio road, and on the west by the property of Ambrosio Carlos, having an area of 636 square meters, which was acquired by them through inheritance from their

years.<br\/><br\/>Monica Laderas stated that she was in possession as owner, and had been for some twenty years past, of a lot in the barrio of Frances, bounded on the north by the barrio road, on the east by the property of Bernardo Reyes, on the south by the Rio Grande de la Pampanga, and on the west by the property of Pedro del Rosario, with an area of 1,625 square meters, which was inherited by

lots were acquired by him through inheritance from his parents who during their lifetime had possessed them as owners for more than thirty years.<br\/><br\/>Gabina, Inocencia, Liceria, Pio and Vicenta, all surnamed Clarin, attended by a curator, alleged that they were, and had been for more than six years, in joint possession of a building lot in the said barrio, bounded on the north by the barrio road, on the east by the property of Andres de Leon, on the south by the Rio Grande de la Pampanga, and on the west by the property of Domingo de Leon, with an area of 396 square meters, which was acquired by them through inheritance from their deceased mother, Antonia de Leon, and by the latter from her parents who had possessed it for more than forty years.<br\/><br\/>Pedro de Leon claimed to be in possession, and to have been since 1907, of a lot bounded on the north by the Frances Barrio road, on the east by another belonging to him, on the south by the Rio Grande, and on the west by the property of Joaquin de Leon, which lot measures 375 square meters and was acquired by him through purchase from Luis Manocab who himself inherited it from his parents who during their lifetime had possessed it as owners for more than forty years.<br\/><br\/>Francisco de Torres set forth that he was the owner of a lot in the said barrio, bounded on the north by the property of Gregoria Arnedo Cruz, on the east by that of Florentina Ramos, on the south by the barrio road, and on the west by the property of the heirs of Calixto Ramos, which lot had an area of 626.40 square meters and was acquired by him by purchase from Domingo de Leon, who had obtained it from Bruno Salamante and the latter from I\u00f1igo Ramos, and that Ramos inherited it from his parents, Vicente and Felipa Carlos, who had possessed it as owners during a period of about forty years.<br\/><br\/>Eugenia Catanghal alleged that she was in possession as owner, and had been for more than twenty years past, of a lot in the barrio of Frances, bounded on the north by the property of Gregoria Arnedo Cruz, on the east by that o\u00a3 Toribio de Leon, on the south by the barrio road, and on the west by the property of Agustin Catanghal, which lot, 1,332 square meters in area, was acquired by her through inheritance from her parents, Lucas and Adriana Hilario, who, during their lifetime, had possessed it as owners for more than thirty years.<br\/><br\/>Mariano Valladar declared that she was the owner of a lot in the said barrio, bounded on the north by the barrio road, on the east by the property of Agustin Catanghal, on the south by the Rio Grande de la Pampanga, and on the west by the property of Clara de Leon, which lot, 945 square meters in area, was purchased by him, through a public instrument of February 6, 1907, from Domingo de Leon who, by a private instrument of February 1, 1905, had bought it from the spouses Feliciano and Teresa Mercado.<br\/><br\/>Julian de Leon alleged that he was in possession as owner, and had been for more than eighteen years, of a lot in the same barrio, bounded on the north by the barrio road, on the east by the property of Joaquin de Leon, on the south by the Rio Grande de la Pampanga, and on the west by the property of Agustin Catanghal, which lot, 11 ares and 56 centares in area, was acquired by him more than 20 years before, by gift from Estefania Torres who during her lifetime had possessed it as owner for more than thirty years.<br\/><br\/>Clara de Leon alleged that she was in possession as owner, and had been for more than twenty years, of a building lot in the said barrio, bounded on the north by the barrio road, on the east by the property of Mariano Valladar, on the south by the Rio Grande de la Pampanga, and on the west by the property of Andres de Leon, which lot, containing an area of 792 square meters, was acquired by her through inheritance from her parents, Florentino and Juana Payabyab, who during their lifetime had possessed it as owners for more than thirty years.<br\/><br\/>All the aforementioned opponents alleged that their respective lots were within the perimeter of the parcels of land registered in the name of the applicants by the decree of February 20, 1908, and therefore asked for the annulment of the same, in so far as it affected their above-described respective lots, and that the costs be assessed against the applicants.<br\/><br\/>A rehearing in this case having been had, with the production of evidence adduced by the parties, the court, on August 16, 1910, upon the facts established, found against the oppositions presented and ordered the registration of the two parcels of land, described in the application and plans accompanying the record of the case, in the names.of the sisters Gregoria Arnedo Cruz, Manuela Arnedo Cruz, Maria Concepcion Arnedo Cruz and Juana Arnedo Cruz. From this order counsel for the opponents excepted and by written motion asked for a rehearing on the ground that the evidence did not justify the judgment and that the latter was contrary to law. This motion was denied by order of September 2, 1910, from which order exception was taken by counsel for the opponents who announced their intention to appeal, by bill of exceptions, which, when filed, was certified and forwarded with the record of the case to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The issue herein involved is one of the registration, in the Court of Land Registration, of two parcels of land claimed to belong to the applicants Gregoria, Manuela, Maria Concepcion, and Juana, all surnamed Arnedo Cruz, which two rural properties are described in the plan presented by the appellants as Exhibit A.<br\/><br\/>It is unquestionable that the said four sisters are the owners and are in possession of the two said parcels of land, used for the cultivation of rice and sugar cane and situate in the barrio of San Miguel, of the pueblo of Calumpit, Bulacan.<br\/><br\/>The question to be decided, in view of the oppositions presented by about thirty individuals who possess various lots apparently comprised within the application and plan of the said two parcels of land, is whether it is or is not proper to register the aforementioned two parcels of land with the inclusion of the lots that are the subject of those oppositions.<br\/><br\/>The opponents have furnished proof that they, as well also as their predecessors in interest, have been in possession, as owners, of their respective lots, all of them for much more than ten years, and the applicants, on the unestablished allegation that the opponents are mere usurpers of certain portions of the properties in dispute, have not proved that the said opponents occupy these portions of land by virtue of any permission, nor by the mere tolerance of the owners of the two parcels before mentioned, nor have they shown how and in what manner the opponents succeeded in entering thereon.<br\/><br\/>Although the documentary and other evidence produced by the applicants has shown conclusively that they are the legitimate owners and possessors of the two aforementioned parcels of land, yet they have not duly established the fact that they are the owners of the portions now in the possession of the opponents, and whether these lots are comprised within the perimeter and boundaries of the two said parcels of land designated on the plan under the letters A and B. The question presented of first importance is one of metes and bounds, or of area.<br\/><br\/>Santiago V. Cruz, an agent of Teodoro Tiongson, who was formerly a lessee of the said two parcels of land during three years prior to 1882, testified that, as such agent, he had not collected any land rent for the lots, occupied by many houses, which were within the land that formed the barrio called Frances; that the lands leased by Tiongson from the applicants' mother were used for the cultivation of rice and sugar cane; that, at the expiration of Tiongson's lease, the latter were taken over by Victoria Arnedo; and that several tenants on shares lived in their houses built on the leased lands.<br\/><br\/>Victoria Arnedo Cruz testified that she had leased the said two parcels of land, used for the cultivation of rice and sugar cane; that in the barrio of Frances there were houses, about fifteen or twenty in number, built on the lots which adjoined the lands of Gregoria Arnedo Cruz, some of which lots are situate on the bank of the river; that in the contract of lease executed by the witness and the applicants' mother, the said lots are not included, for the land leased by the former only extended to the fences of the said lots, and this she also had been told by Teodoro Tiongson, the preceding lessee, who himself had been so informed by the owner of the lands, the applicants' mother; that witness did not know whether the latter, during her lifetime, collected rent for the said lots, for witness, as lessee, did not collect such rent for them; that she did not believe that these lots were comprised within the lands leased by her, and, finally, that some of them, occupied by residents of that barrio, formed a part of the land owned by her, adjacent to the lands of the applicants, while others were a part of the lands of the latter.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing testimony it is concluded that, in the successive leases of the said two parcels of land, there were not included lots which appear to have been occupied by various residents of the locality, apparently the opponents, and, inasmuch as the latter were long prior to 1882 in material possession of the lots which they occupied, without having made any acknowledgment of the applicants' alleged ownership, nor of that of their predecessor in interest; and, further, since there is no evidence to show how and in what manner the opponents and their predecessors in interest began to occupy the lots in question and that they entered upon the same through the tolerance of their alleged owners, and also that the said lots formed a part of the two parcels of land sought to be registered, it would be improper to hold that the disputed lots should be included in the registration.<br\/><br\/>As for all other aspects of the case, let it be borne in mind that by abandonment, negligence or carelessness, owners provided with the most perfect titles may be deprived and dispossessed of their properties by usurpers who, by the lapse of the time specified by law, acquire the same by prescription.

San Antonio and Atanasi Mapa to bear false testimony in the proceedings had\u00a0 against Hilario and Eladio Siguenza, according to the testimony given by Juan Carrascoso, Atanasia Mapa, Sotero Buquiron, Victoriano San Antonio, Silvina Morandar and Rosendo Alcantara, a complaint\u00a0 was filed by the provincial fiscal, January\u00a0 14, 1911, after a preliminary investigation\u00a0 had been held as t of an accusation\u00a0 made by the said Rosendo Alcantara before the justice of the peace of Buhi, charging Pascual Morandarte with the crime\u00a0 of subornation of perjury, and,\u00a0 this case having been instituted,\u00a0 the jud aforementioned was rendered therein.<\/p><p>This case concerns the crime of subornation of perjury, provided for and punished by Act No. 1697, sections 3 and 4 of which read as follows:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Sec. 3.\u00a0 Any person who, having\u00a0 taken an\u00a0 oath\u00a0 before a competent tribunal, officer,\u00a0 or\u00a0 person, in any case in which a\u00a0 law of the Phili Islands authorizes an oath to be administered, that he\u00a0 will testify, de depose, or certify truly, or that any written\u00a0 testimony,\u00a0 declaration, deposition,\u00a0 or certificate by him subscribed is true, willfully and con such oath states or subscribes any material matter which\u00a0 he does not be to be true,\u00a0 is guilty of perjury,\u00a0 and shall be punished by a fine of more than two thousand pesos and by imprisonment for not more than five years;\u00a0 and shall, moreover, thereafter be incapable of holding any publ office or of giving testimony in any court of the\u00a0 Philippine Islands un time as\u00a0 the judgment against him is reversed.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"Sec. 4.\u00a0 Any person\u00a0 who causes\u00a0 or\u00a0 procures another person to commit perjury as defined in the preceding section is guilty of subornation of and shall be punished as in said section prescribed.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>It is undeniable that, in the preliminary investigation made by\u00a0 the jus the peace of the pueblo of Buhi, by virtue of the accusation presented b Pascual\u00a0 Morandarte charging Eladio, Hilario and Santiago Siguenza with having stolen from him money and jewelry which he had in his house, Victoriano San Antonio and Atanasia Mapa testified as witnesses in suppo of the said accusation and in their testimony\u00a0 swore that they\u00a0 had seen Eladio carry\u00a0 away money and jewelry in a bundle on the date the theft was alleged to have been committed; in their subsequent testimony, they retracted their former sworn statements, asserting that they had\u00a0 previo testified falsely, through the inducement of\u00a0 Pascual\u00a0 Morandarte,\u00a0 in that\u00a0 their first false testimony might be presented against the accused surnamed Siguenza.<\/p><p>Had it not\u00a0 been for\u00a0 that retraction by the witnesses San Antonio and Mapa,\u00a0 perhaps the\u00a0 crime imputed to the accused would\u00a0 have been deemed true and been\u00a0 proved; wherefore\u00a0 it is\u00a0 unquestionable that the false testimony of the said two witnesses presented by the accuser, was conducive to proving important and essential facts which, duly proved, would\u00a0 have determined the\u00a0 conviction and\u00a0 sentencing\u00a0 of the\u00a0 accused for\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime of\u00a0 theft, for\u00a0 these witnesses stated that the latter, Siguenza, was seen, on the occasion in\u00a0 question,\u00a0 carrying a bundle containing money and jewelry.<\/p><p>When the two said witnesses retracted their former declarations,\u00a0 alleg that what\u00a0 they had stated therein was false, they added that they\u00a0 had knowingly violated\u00a0 their oath, being induced so to do by the said Morandarte.\u00a0 It is, therefore, unquestionable that the defendant incurr responsibility and was guilty of the crime of subornation of perjury, i as being\u00a0 well aware\u00a0 that the two witnesses,\u00a0 Atanasia Mapa and Victorino San\u00a0 Antonio, knew nothing of the act\u00a0 charged against the Siguenza brothers and\u00a0 did not see one of the latter,\u00a0 Eladio, carrying bundle containing money and jewelry; nevertheless he induced, procured influenced the said witnesses to testify to an act imagined by him, whi they did to accommodate him, although afterwards, impelled by the dictates of\u00a0 conscience, they retracted their\u00a0 former false declaration told the\u00a0 truth before the judge who\u00a0 for this purpose had put them und oath.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is evident, therefore, that the defendant is guilty\u00a0 of the subornation of perjury and,\u00a0 consequently, has\u00a0 incurred\u00a0 the penalty specified in section 3 of the Act aforecited.<\/p><p>The defendant denied the charge and pleaded not guilty; but, notwithstanding his exculpatory allegations, the record furnishes concl proof of his guilt as the proved perpetrator,\u00a0 beyond all doubt,\u00a0 of\u00a0 t crime of subornation of perjury under prosecution, for the\u00a0 contents of judgment, certified to this\u00a0 court and rendered by\u00a0 the judge of the Co of First Instance jn the case prosecuted against the perjured witnesses Atanasia Mapa an$ Victoriano San Antonio, constitute due\u00a0 proof of the criminal act and the responsibility of the accused.<\/p><p>Even though it be established, as was done by the trial court in its judgment, that, in accordance with the sense and spirit of the law, the witnesses Atanasia Mapa\u00a0 and Victoriano San Antonio, convicted of the crime of perjury, are incompetent, and are disqualified from testifying case, nevertheless\u00a0 the act of subornation of perjury and the guilt of defendant, Pascual Morandarte, the sole person responsible therefor, ha been proven by the testimony of the justice of the peace,\u00a0 Juan Carrascoso, before whom the said two witnesses, convicted as perjurers, made their respective false declarations and,\u00a0 before the same justice, retracted them during the preliminary investigation conducted\u00a0 with ref to\u00a0 a crime of theft in which the defendant, Morandarte, was the complainant.<\/p><p>The said act of subornation of perjury, committed by Morandarte, is als proved by the\u00a0 testimony of the witness Sotero Buquiron, who was\u00a0 prese and heard the defendant induce and\u00a0 oblige the witness, Atanasia Mapa, to testify in the said investigation in accordance with the instruction her.\u00a0 Silvina Morandarte, a sister of the\u00a0 defendant and wife of the ot perjured witness, Victoriano San Antonio\u00a0 and\u00a0 Roseritio Alcantara, wit contradiction,\u00a0 between themselves, testified to the certainty of the defendant's\u00a0 having\u00a0 suborned the said San Antonio to\u00a0 commit perjury, and that\u00a0 in so\u00a0 doing Morandarte gave\u00a0 the latter specific instruction regard to what was to be his testimony in that investigation, and a pap containing a memorandum of the\u00a0 same.\u00a0 Therefore, even taking no account of the testimony of the said perjured witnesses, because of the disqualification, the defendant's\u00a0 guilt is well proved, because it is unquestionably shown that he did commit the crime charged by inducing those two witnesses to testify in corroborate of the facts alleged\u00a0 in accusation, although they afterwards retracted their testimony and told truth, wherefore, an action for perjury having been instituted against they were sentenced in accordance with the law.<\/p><p>With respect to\u00a0 the error\u00a0 assigned to the trial judge, for not having stricken out of the record the testimony of the witness, the justice of peace Juan Carrascoso, inasmuch as the best proof, as averred by the defense, relative to the\u00a0 statements made by the\u00a0 witnesses\u00a0 Mapa\u00a0 and San Antonio, who subsequently retracted the same, is the written memorandum made by the said justice of the peace and containing a brief statement of their\u00a0 testimony, it suffices to say that, in accordance w provisions of section 13 of Act\u00a0 No. 1627, which is amendatory of\u00a0 Act 194, it is not necessary for the testimony of a witness in a preliminar investigation to be set down in writing; when it is essential that the testimony\u00a0 given by a\u00a0 witness\u00a0 before\u00a0 a justice of the peace appear o record in a cause, the latter must state under oath\u00a0 all\u00a0 that the witn testified,\u00a0 as he did do in the present case, it is not necessary\u00a0 that memorandum made by him of such\u00a0 testimony be exhibited and attached to the record, yas this is\u00a0 not required by law.<\/p><p>For the foregoing\u00a0 reasons,\u00a0 whereby the\u00a0 errors assigned to the\u00a0 judgm appealed from have been\u00a0 refuted, and holding that the latter is in accordance with the law and the merits of the case, it is our opinion t the same should be and\u00a0 it is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

But appellant prays the reinstatement of his\u00a0 appeal, on the ground that his failure to prosecute his appeal as required by the rules was due to his excusable negligence, in that he mistakenly believed that his case was in the hands of competent attorneys, and that everything was being done by them on his behalf in conformity with the law and in strict compliance with the rules of court.\u00a0 He declares that, being an ignorant man, with no knowledge as to the mode in which he should proceed, he requested two friends in whom he had confidence to act on his behalf and to employ counsel\u00a0 to look after his case; that for that purpose he gave them over eight hundred pesos to cover their\u00a0 expenses to Manila and to pay the court costs and\u00a0 counsels' fees;\u00a0 that they went to Manila and on their return informed him that in fulfilment of their mission\u00a0 they\u00a0 had\u00a0 employed eminent\u00a0 and competent counsel, who had sent him a message that he need not trouble his head further in\u00a0 the matter as\u00a0 it was now in the hands of his counsel, who would do everything necessary to guard his interests; that not until some time after his case had been dismissed did he discover that his trusted friends had betrayed his trust,\u00a0 had misappropriated\u00a0 the greater part of the money, and had failed to secure\u00a0 the services of counsel; that on discovering the facts as to\u00a0 the dismissal of his appeal, and the reason therefor, he promptly submitted his motion for the reinstatement of his appeal, with a full explanation of his apparent neglect and\u00a0 failure to prosecute it to effect as required\u00a0 by the rules of court.<\/p><p>We are inclined to believe\u00a0 that\u00a0 the truth of his statements\u00a0 is substantially corroborated by the affidavits\u00a0 and other documentary evidence filed with his motion for reinstatement,\u00a0 and we would be strongly inclined\u00a0 to reinstate his\u00a0 appeal, but for\u00a0 the\u00a0 fact that a\u00a0 careful\u00a0 examination of the whole record, including the\u00a0 bill of\u00a0 exceptions and the evidence taken in the court below, satisfies us that the original appeal was without merit;\u00a0 so\u00a0 that even if the\u00a0 appeal were reinstated and\u00a0 thereafter\u00a0 prosecuted to effect,\u00a0 the proceedings would necessarily terminate in\u00a0 a judgment affirming the judgment of the trial court,\u00a0 with the costs against the defendant and appellant.<\/p><p>The whole case in the court below turned upon the validity and true meaning or interpretation of a certain document, which the trial court held to be a \"<em>venta con pacto de retro<\/em>\"\u00a0 (conditional sale).\u00a0 The defendant insisted that this document should be construed as a <em>hipoteca<\/em> (mortgage instrument) and\u00a0 not\u00a0 as a <em>venta con pacto de\u00a0 retro;<\/em>\u00a0 and that if its terms do not admit of such a construction, then that it should be declared illegal and invalid on the ground that\u00a0 plaintiff had procured its execution\u00a0 by\u00a0 fraud\u00a0 and deceit.<\/p><p>Examining the instrument itself there can be no question that, in accord with the uniform doctrine laid down by this court in a long\u00a0 line of decisions construing instrumenis of like tenor and import, the trial court properly construed the terms of the contract therein set\u00a0 forth as a\u00a0 <em>venta\u00a0 con<\/em> <em>pacto de retro<\/em>.\u00a0 And examining the evidence of record, we agree with \"the trial court that defendant's witnesses failed utterly to establish his allegations\u00a0 of fraud or deceit'in the execution of the instrument in question.\u00a0\u00a0 Whatever may have been the truth in this regard, and whatever may have been the real understanding between the parties, the vague and uncertain testimony of the witnesses for the defendant was\u00a0 wholly insufficient to maintain his charges of fraud and deceit,\u00a0 or to put in doubt the legal execution and validity of the instrument.\u00a0 In the absence of at least a preponderance of proof that the instrument was fraudulently executed and that it does not truthfully set forth the agreement between the parties,\u00a0 the trial\u00a0 court\u00a0 correctly adjudicated the contention of the parties in conformity with the terms of this instrument.<\/p><p>It\u00a0 is clear, therefore, that the reinstatement of defendant's appeal would not result in a reversal\u00a0 or modification of the judgment entered in the\u00a0 court below.\u00a0\u00a0 We are fully satisfied, therefore, that it would only result in\u00a0 additional delay and expense to the litigants, and could serve no useful purpose.<\/p><p>Where,\u00a0 as in\u00a0 this\u00a0 case, a party seeks\u00a0 relief from\u00a0 the effect of an order or judgment entered against him\u00a0 because\u00a0 of\u00a0 his\u00a0 failure to comply with prescribed rules of procedure, and\u00a0 bases his prayer for relief on the ground that his failure so to do was due to his excusable\u00a0 negligence,\u00a0 such\u00a0 relief may properly be denied him in\u00a0 any case wherein it does not\u00a0 appear that to deny\u00a0 the\u00a0 relief would have the effect of shutting out a meritorious\u00a0 claim or defense, or wherein\u00a0 it appears that to grant the\u00a0 relief would have no other effect than uselessly to prolong the litigation without affecting the final result of the litigation.<\/p><p>The following citations sufficiently illustrate the manner in which this doctrine has been applied in\u00a0 the United States and support the rule just laid down:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Relief will not be granted upon\u00a0 a motion to\u00a0 vacate an order dismissing an appeal for the nonfiling return to the appeal within the\u00a0 prescribed time, if the\u00a0 appeal is without merits, and the\u00a0 party would not be\u00a0 benefitted by its\u00a0 restoration.\u00a0\u00a0 (Supt.\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Poor <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> Bostwick,\u00a0 4\u00a0 Alb.

the\u00a0 daughter of a\u00a0 sister of\u00a0 full blood of the same defendant, named\u00a0 Alfonsa, like deceased; and a daughter\u00a0 of a half-brother of\u00a0 the said\u00a0 Urbano Castillo, named Estefano Libingting,\u00a0 also deceased.\u00a0 The descendants of these three family branches claim to be entitled to share with Urbano Ca the ownership\u00a0 of the land in question, as being the only property Simon Madlangbayan had left at her death.\u00a0 Hence, the demand for\u00a0 a division, which is the object of this suit, although Alfonsa Castillo's daughter f a defendant therein merely by default.<p>The defendant Urbano\u00a0 Castillo, as the\u00a0 sole possessor of the land, endeavored to\u00a0 prove\u00a0 that\u00a0 his\u00a0 mother, Simona Madlangbayan, had other property which during her life-time she disposed of to the benefit of so of the plaintiffs; but the lower\u00a0 court held that this allegation had no proven, and such conclusion must be affirmed as it is well-founded and i wise erroneous.<\/p><p>In the judgment rendered the claim made by the plaintiffs was recognized be valid and the property of joint-owner- ship was\u00a0 ordered\u00a0 to\u00a0 be divided into four parts: One, for Macaria Castillo and her nephews\u00a0 and nieces,\u00a0 Juan, Clemente,\u00a0 Pedro,\u00a0 Lope, Tomasa, and\u00a0 Maria, all\u00a0 surname Cadano; another, for Juliana Libingting; another, for Maria Quizon; and fourth, for the defendant Urbano Castillo.<\/p><p>The latter entered an exception to this judgment, moved for a rehearing, excepted to the ruling denying the same, and filed a bill of exceptions, however, was held on file until the conclusion of the trial and during t progress of the proceedings had for the division, award of shares and liquidation of fruits, which\u00a0 operations\u00a0 were all effected through commissioners and as a result thereof the court ordered:\u00a0 (1) That each coparcener be delivered the part of the property shown on the rough sket made by the commissioners, to\u00a0 belong\u00a0 to him or her;\u00a0 (2) that Urbano Castillo pay to each coparcener, as reimbursement of fruits, P78.18; and that the expense of partition be borne <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pro rata<\/span> by all the interested parties.<\/p><p>When, after all this procedure, the case was\u00a0 brought before us\u00a0 on appe through the proper bill of exceptions, the judgment was\u00a0 not impugned oh account of the form of division therein ordered, but merely because of t following assignments of error:\u00a0 <\/p><ol><li>Because\u00a0 the\u00a0 personality of the plaintiffs was recognized, and the amendment of the answer, impugning\u00a0 such personality, was disallowed.\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>Because\u00a0 the instrument of gift was held\u00a0 to\u00a0 be false, and the gift and void.<br\/><\/li>\u00a0 <li>Because\u00a0 an indemnity\u00a0 for\u00a0 the fruits was awarded.<\/li><\/ol><p>With respect to the first assignment of error,\u00a0 it is not a\u00a0 principle by law that heirs\u00a0 of legal\u00a0 age\u00a0 may not demand the division of a real property, left\u00a0 them by their predecessor-in-interest and\u00a0 held by\u00a0 a co without first initiating special intestate proceedings\u00a0 during which a administrator is to be appointed, who alone is vested with the personality claim the property that belongs to the succession.\u00a0 On the contrary, such are expressly authorized\u00a0 to\u00a0 do so,\u00a0 unless, for the reason of there\u00a0 b unpaid\u00a0 debts, judicial intervention\u00a0 becomes necessary, which was\u00a0 not alleged as a special defense in this suit.<\/p><p>As much\u00a0 for the preceding reasons as because there was not included in bill of\u00a0 exceptions the question relative to the opportune or inopportune motion\u00a0 presented for an amendment of the answer to the complaint, and which was denied by the lower court, such assignment of error, alleged i instance, can\u00a0 neither be considered nor decided.<\/p><p>With reference to the second alleged error, the document declared in\u00a0 the judgment appealed from to\u00a0 be false,\u00a0 null and\u00a0 void, is one of\u00a0 gift which the appellant\u00a0 avers\u00a0 was executed in\u00a0 his behalf by his predecessor-in- interest\u00a0 The finding of falsity,\u00a0 contained in the judgment of the lower court and based on various\u00a0 facts discussed by him in detail, can not be brought up in this appeal except\u00a0 as a\u00a0 question of fact, with regard to which n new matter may be introduced inasmuch as no\u00a0 error of fact was alleged t have been committed\u00a0 in\u00a0 weighing the evidence; and the\u00a0 cogent presumption of law, which can not easily be destroyed\u00a0 except by strong contrary evidence - the only reason advanced by the\u00a0 appellant - reenforces the old public instruments executed in conformity with the Notarial Law, repealed) before a notary public, by reason of their insertion in the pr or notarial registry and the\u00a0 personal attestation made by that official the proceedings and the contents of the\u00a0 instrument - characteristic features not enjoyed\u00a0 by a private instrument which, executed on one date, like t one in question (January 20,1902), appears to have been ratified on another (November 15, 1905), before a notary, but with no further authorization the part of this official other than such act of affirmation.<\/p><p>And even though the said\u00a0 instrument were not false, the trial court\u00a0 declared it to be void\u00a0 and ineffective.\u00a0 The alleged gift was in fact null and v according to the provisions of articles 629\u00a0 and\u00a0 633 of\u00a0 the Civil Code its acceptance by the donee was\u00a0 in no manner expressed in the instrument nor was the pretended gift consummated pursuant to the provision contain in article 623 of the same code.<\/p><p>The appellant\u00a0 argues that the acceptance in writing of the gift in ques was not necessary, as it was made for a valuable consideration, and should be subject to the legal provisions governing contracts.\u00a0 If\u00a0 this allege was really made,\u00a0 it was one of those mentioned in article 619 of the aforecited\u00a0 code, as being a gift \"which imposes upon the donee a burden inferior\u00a0 to the value of the gift,\" for Simona Madlangbayan apparently stated in the said instrument that she delivered the land to Urbano Cast order that he defray the expenses\u00a0 of her subsistence and burial, \"and i perchance anything\u00a0 should remain from the price of the land, the surplus the said expenses (?)<em> is granted<\/em> to him by me.\"\u00a0 A gift of this k not in fact a gift for a valuable consideration, but is\u00a0 remuneratory or compensatory, made\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose\u00a0 of remunerating or compensating a charge, burden or condition imposed upon the donee, inferior to the value of the gift which,\u00a0 therefore, may very properly be termed to\u00a0 be conditional, and article 622, invoked by the appellant himself, very clearly prescribes that\u00a0 \"gifts for valuable consideration shall\u00a0 be governed by provisions of <em>this<\/em> title with regard to the part exceeding the va the\u00a0 charge imposed,\" to say nothing of the finding of the trial court t the said instrument was false as shown by the evidence and in accordance with which the defendant did\u00a0 not fulfill the conditions mentioned, sinc did not defray the expenses\u00a0 for the subsistence and burial\u00a0 of Simona Madlangbayan.<\/p><p>With regard to the third assignment of error, the appellant contends that reimbursement of fruits should have been awarded the plaintiffs, as no demand for the\u00a0 same was made in the complaint and he was unable to prepare evidence in the matter.\u00a0 The procedure had after the plaintiffs found to be entitled to the right of co-ownership, was in all respects in accord with the provisions of\u00a0 section 191 of the Code of Civil Procedure and so well\u00a0 prepared was the appellant in the second part of the trial, the presentation of evidence,\u00a0 that\u00a0 he stated\u00a0 himself \"I do\u00a0 not even to cross-examine\"\u00a0 (his brief, p. 10).<\/p><p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with\u00a0 the\u00a0 costs of this\u00a0 instance against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Torres, Mapa,\u00a0 Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and\u00a0 <em>Trent, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><\/div>",

On  said date  Barretto &amp; Co.  executed,  in favor of the appellee, a twenty-year lease on the six-eighths interest referred to, said lease containing the following clause;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Should the said Barretto &amp; Co. sell the said lots herein leased said company shall  require  the purchaser  of said premises to respect this lease, and the lessee shall have the preference in the purchase of said lots at the same price and under the same conditions.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Said  lease also contained the following provision:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If during the life of this lease the lessee, Lim Tuico, or his heirs should desire to sell the building and his interest in the land in question, Barretto &amp; Co.  shall have the same preference on the same conditions, and in case a third person should be the purchaser he shall himself assume all the obligations and the acquired benefits of this lease.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>After the execution of this lease the appellee, as coowner and lessee, constructed a building thereon for storage purposes.<\/p>\n<p>On the 21st of December, 1909, the lessor, Barretto &amp; Co,, without notifying the appellee, sold and conveyed its interest in said lots to the defendant Cu-Unjieng, setting out in the deed the lease above referred to and the rights of the lessee to purchase the property as  in said lease  expressed.  The amount named in said  deed as the purchase price of said lots was P60,000.  On the day following, December 22,1909, Mr. Barretto, who was acting for the firm of Barretto &amp; Co., reported the sale to his brother in Madrid by cable in which he said, \"I have sold Rosario P40,000.\"  On the same date Barretto paid to the broker Gonzalez  his commission of 1 per cent on the purchase price of P40,000, in proof of which the latter's receipt was produced  by Mr. Barretto.  On December 27, 1909, a  deed of donation in the sum of P20,000 was executed by Barretto &amp; Co.  to the defendant before a notary public, who was a different notary public than the one before whom the deed heretofore referred to was  executed, reciting as a consideration therefor that the title to the property conveyed to the defendant on the 21st was defective.  In that instrument  no mention  was made of the  obligation under which Barretto &amp; Co. lay by virtue of its warranty in the deed of sale of the  lots  in question.   Instead of said instrument relieving said company from the burden of said warranty, a second warranty was therein set out in the form of an agreement to  return the balance of the purchase price P40,000, if the appellant failed to secure a title within one year.<\/p>\n<p>On January  3, 1910,  one week after executing the  deed of donation just referred to,  Barretto  wrote a letter to the appellant  in which  he inclosed a notice directed to the appellee notifying him of the sale  to the appellant and that he could pay him rent in the future under the lease.  Nothing, however, was said about the  appellee's right to buy the property as set forth in the lease  between him and Barretto &amp; Co.  On the 11th day of January, the last day but one before the expiration of the period of the nine days after notice prescribed by article 1524 of the Civil Code relative to the exercise of the right of redemption in such cases, the appellee purchased the property from the appellant, paying therefor the sum of P60,000, which amount the appellant represented by recital in said deed as having been paid to Barretto &amp; Co. as the purchase price of said property.<\/p>\n<p>The appellee, the plaintiff in the court below, having soon thereafter discovered, as he believed, \u00a6 that  under the law and by virtue of his agreement he was in reality obligated to pay only P40,000, and believing that he had consequently been unjustly and illegally deprived of P20,000, began this action for the recovery  of that amount.  The court  below after  trial found  in favor of the plaintiff and gave him  a judgment against the defendant for  P20,000, interest and costs.   This appeal is from that judgment.<\/p>\n<p>We are  of  the  opinion that the judgment of the court below must be affirmed.  The court below found as a fact:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That on the  3d  day of January, 1910, Mr. Barretto notified the plaintiff of the sale which he had made of Barretto &amp; Co.'s interest in  the land and to whom the sale was made, and on  the  same day notified the defendant that the plaintiff had been notified  of the  sale and that he  could arrange with him  about the payment of the rent;<\/p>\n<p>\"That on the following day the plaintiff went to the defendant to ascertain  what price he had paid for Barretto &amp; Co.'s interest in the land, and was  told by the defendant that it was the sum of P60,000, and thereafter and on January 11, 1910, the defendant and the plaintiff went before a notary public  and a deed of transfer of the three-fourths interest was made by the defendant to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff paid  the  defendant the sum of P60,000, and the deed recited that the purchase price of the interest was the sum of P60,000;<\/p>\n<p>\"That in the deed from Barretto &amp; Co. to the defendant the preference right of the plaintiff  to purchase the interest of Barretto &amp; Co. was specifically set forth, and the defendant had full knowledge of the fact that the plaintiff had the right of purchase or redemption from such sale;<\/p>\n<p>\"That shortly after the plaintiff made the purchase,  as before stated he learned that the true purchase price which the defendant paid was the sum of P40,000, and he thereupon demanded the return of the P20,000 overpaid.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>As to the question which was before the court for determination the trial court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The only question for determination is, Was the actual purchase price when the defendant purchased from Barretto &amp; Co, the sum of P60,000 or P40,000?\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It is the claim on the part of the defendant in this case that after having purchased the property from Mr. Barretto for the agreed price of P60,000 he discovered that the title thereto was defective  in that it was not subject to registration under the Torrens Law of the Philippine Islands, and that, thereupon, Barretto reduced the purchase price to P40,000; that, therefore, the real purchase price was P40,000 and not P60,000.  The defendant in this case, in negotiating the purchase in question, was represented by one Edilberto Calixto.  Concerning the transaction Mr. Barretto testified:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. At  the time you  received  this check for P60,000, what documents or papers, if any, did you deliver to Edilberto Calixto?\u2014A. I gave him an I O U for P20,000, because the agreement  was to sell the property for P40,000, but the deal was made for P60,000 because they wanted to have it for a bigger price, as they said it would facilitate matters in case they wanted  to get  some money on the property under mortgage.  The sale was practically done for P40,000, and they paid P60,000 and got my provisional I O U for P20,000.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. To whom did you deliver that provisional I O U for P20,000?\u2014A. To Mr.  Calixto, who was representing Cu-Unjieng.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Do  you know where that I O U  is  now?\u2014A. That was destroyed,<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. It was destroyed?\u2014A. Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q,  What was the occasion for its destruction, Mr. Barretto?\u2014A. When  I  signed  the  second deed and returned him the P20,000, he gave me back the IOU and I destroyed it, and that finished the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q.  By the second deed, do you mean the deed of donation executed  in  favor  of  the  defendant  Cu-Unjieng  for P20,000?\u2014 A. Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">*       *       *       *      *        *       *<\/p>\n<p>\"Q.  Did you pay  Mr.  Gonzalez any commission  for the sale of this Rosario property?\u2014A. Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q.  On what amount did you pay  him a commission?\u2014A.P40,000.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q.  Did you  take his receipt  for  the  payment  of that commission ?\u2014A. Yes, sir; I have the voucher.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">*        *\t\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*<\/p>\n<p>\"Q.  I  call your attention to  receipt marked plaintiff's Exhibit B, to your deposition, and ask you to state whether that is the receipt issued by the broker, Mr. Gonzalez, to you in acknowledgment of the commission?\u2014 A. Yes, sir; though he does not mention in the receipt  on what amount it  is based,  you can easily see\u20141 per cent; P400, which is on P40,000.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q.  I  call your attention to the erasure of the words, 'Mil dos  cientos,' and the insertion of the words, 'cuatrocientos,'  and ask you how that  occurred?\u2014A,  He  wanted to collect 3 per cent  on the sale; but I told him I could not pay  but 1 per cent.  That is his agreement; he came to me and  offered to sell; so  I cut his commission from three to one.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The  broker  Gonzalez,  who acted  for  Barretto  &amp; Co., testified,  in part, as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I went to Cu-Unjieng and offered to sell him the Barraca house and told him  I was also selling the house on Calle Rosario, and asked him if he wanted to buy it, and the highest offer  I could get was P87,500 for the two properties, if I remember correctly, and Mr. Barretto accepted  it.   There was afterward some difficulty because Cu-Unjieng wished that the price should be placed at P60,000 for the property on Calle Rosario and P27,500 for the property on Calle Barraca.  Mr. Barretto refused both propositions, because the property on Calle Barraca was his own property and that on Calle Rosario of Barretto &amp; Co.   At last he accepted it, putting P60,000 for the property on Calle Rosario, on the condition that he would only receive P40,000 and P27,500 for the property on Calle Barraca.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Q.  How was the deal managed so as to make it appear that the vendor received P60,000, as stated by you, whereas, as a matter of fact, he only received \u00a5=40,000 for the Calle Rosario property?\u2014A, On making  the payment Barretto gave him a receipt for P20,000.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The fact that the sale was in reality made for P40,000 is corroborated by a cablegram which Mr. Barretto sent to Madrid, Spain, in which he stated, as heretofore mentioned, that the Rosario property had  been sold for P40,000.<\/p>\n<p>It being remembered that the  defendant alleges as one of the reasons why Barretto was  willing to  reduce the purchase price from P60,000 to P40,000 was that he  was desirous of immediately leaving this  country for Spain and did not want to leave any unsettled matters behind him; it is significant to note that at the time Mr. Barretto  sold the  Calle Rosario  property  he  was not  contemplating a journey to Europe, \"because,\" as he said, \"I was then manager of 'La Insular,' and expected to remain in Manila for a long time.\"<\/p>\n<p>It being apparent to us from all the facts that the selling price was P40,000 and that the dealings between the parties relative to the P60,000 were for the purpose of covering up the realities of the case as to the plaintiff, we find the judgment of the court below well founded.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment  is affirmed, it being  understood  that the judgment of the  court below is the sum of P20,000, with interest thereon at six per centum per annum  from the 4th day of April, 1910, down to the  date of that judgment, to which sum, principal and interest, shall be added interest at 6 per cent per annum from the date of that judgment to the date of the final judgment of this court.<\/p>\n<em>Arellano, C.

The defendant testified thai he had been assigned certain work in the mine on the day in. question; that Santiago\u00a0 Espa\u00f1a had requested him to assist him in certain other work; that he refused to render such assistance for the\u00a0 reason that he had his own\u00a0 work to perform; that Santiago Espa\u00f1a had insulted him by the use of\u00a0 certain indecent language and had struck\u00a0 him with a club; that a fight ensued\u00a0 between them, during which,\u00a0 while Santiago Espa\u00f1a had hold of his\u00a0 throat, the fingers of Santiago Espa\u00f1a were thrust into his mouth and that he,\u00a0 in order to protect himself, bit the\u00a0 fingers of Santiago Espa\u00f1a; that during the fight the said American arrived and separated them.\u00a0 The fact that the fingers of Santiago Espa\u00f1a had been bitten by the defendant is, therefore, an admitted fact. As a result of the injury thus received, certain of the fingers on the hand\u00a0 of Santiago Espa\u00f1a were rendered useless.<\/p><p>The appellant attempts to\u00a0 show that the fingers of Santiago Espa\u00f1a were\u00a0 rendered useless by reason of the fact that he failed to promptly secure medical assistance; that the permanent injury was .due to the negligence or lack of proper care on the part of Santiago Espa\u00f1a, and that the injuries in the first instance were not sufficient of themselves to have produced the permanent injury.\u00a0 The evidence does show that\u00a0 Santiago Espa\u00f1a delayed for\u00a0 a few days\u00a0 to secure medical\u00a0 assistance.\u00a0 There is,\u00a0 however, nothing in the record\u00a0 which\u00a0 shows, more than a mere presumption, that prompt medical attendance would have avoided the result from\u00a0 which\u00a0 Santiago Espa\u00f1a is now\u00a0 suffering.\u00a0 It certainly was the duty of Santiago Espa\u00f1a to have taken all the precaution possible to have avoided any result from the injuries which did not necessarily and directly flow from the original cause.<\/p><p>The defendant\u00a0 testified\u00a0 that\u00a0 Andres\u00a0 Quebral was\u00a0 not present at the time of the fight between him and Santiago Espa\u00f1a.\u00a0 Andres Quebral testified that he was present and that he saw all that took place.\u00a0 His statement of the fight and the cause leading thereto is substantiated\u00a0 practically by the declaration\u00a0 of both the defendant and the injured person.\u00a0 The lower court found that\u00a0 Andres Quebral was present and that he was an intelligent and credible witness. There seems to have been no reason why Andres Quebral should have testified to other than the truth.<\/p><p>It appears that at the time\u00a0 of the trial the defendant was 19 years of age.\u00a0 The trial took place eleven months after the facts occurred.\u00a0 The court found that he was eighteen years of age at the time the\u00a0 facts complained of occurred. No point is made in the record that he was\u00a0 under 18 years of age at the time he committed the alleged crime.<\/p><p>The record shows that Santiago Espa\u00f1a was disabled for a\u00a0 period of about\u00a0 eight months\u00a0 as a result\u00a0 of the injuries and that the fingers of his hand have been rendered more or less useless.<\/p><p>The lower court, within his discretion, gave the defendant the benefit of article 11 of the Penal Code, on account of his age, and thereby reduced the penalty to the minimum of the medium degree of <em>prision correctional,<\/em> which is two years four months and one day.\u00a0 There were neither aggravating nor extenuating circumstances proved.\u00a0 The lower court required the defendant to indemnify Santiago Espa\u00f1a in the sum of P200.\u00a0 There seems to be little proof in the record to\u00a0 support that conclusion,\u00a0 except the fact\u00a0 that\u00a0 the defendant was receiving a daily wage while working in the mine, and that he was rendered unable to pursue his\u00a0 usual occupation for a period of about eight months.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which shows that he had been working each day or that he might have had employment had he not been injured.\u00a0 However the appellant makes no objection to that part of the sentence of the lower court.<\/p><p>Taking into consideration the proof as we find it in the record and the findings of the lower court from such record, and the fact that the lower court\u00a0 saw and heard the witnesses, we are of the opinion that the sentence of the lower court should be affirmed, with costs.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

On the 16th of April, 1902, one Engracio Palanca was appointed administrator with the will annexed of the estate of the said Margarita Jose, deceased, by the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, and Mariano Ocampo Lao Sempco and Dy Cunyao became his sureties and qualified as such in the sum of P60,000. After the execution of this bond the said Palanca, as such administrator, took possession of all the property of said Margarita Jose, amounting in all to $58,820.29 Hongkong currency. On the 22d of April, 1904, the said Mariano Ocampo Lao Sempco died in the city of Manila, testate. The fact of his death was brought to the attention of the Court of First Instance of said city on the 2d of November, 1904, by ah application made by one of the legatees of said Margarita Jose, deceased, for an order directing said administrator to furnish a new bond. Pursuant to this application the court, on the 10th of November, 1904, made an order directing the said Palanca to furnish a bond in the sum of P60,000 to take the place of the undertaking upon which said Mariano Ocampo, deceased, and Dy Cunyao were sureties. The bond thus required was duly filed on the 22d of November, 1904, the sureties thereon being Juan Fernandez, Luis Saenz de Vismanos and Alejandro Palanca. On the 11th of May, 1904, one Doroteo Velasco was appointed administrator with the will annexed of said Mariano Ocampo Lao Sempco, deceased, and on July 7 following Mariano Velasco and Pio de la Guardia Barretto qualified as sureties of the said administrator in the sum of P30,000. Said Mariano Ocampo Lao Sempco left him surviving as his only heirs at law and devisees and legatees one daughter, to whom he devised two-thirds of his estate, and three sons in China, to Whom he devised the remaining one-third. On the 27th of July, 1904, said Doroteo Velasco, as such administrator, filed with the court a complete report and inventory of the property of the deceased, together with a statement of all his debts and liabilities. As a part of this report and inventory said administrator filed an instrument signed by all of the persons interested in the estate of the said Mariano Ocampo agreeing to the partition of the estate among themselves without proceedings in court, at the same time assuming the payment of all obligations against the estate. This agreement of partition was drawn and executed under sections 596 and 597 of the Code of Civil Procedure for the purposes and to attain the ends therein mentioned. On the 28th of July, 1904, the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, upon the request of the administrator with the will annexed and of all parties interested in the estate of the said Mariano Ocampo, deceased, entered an order affirming and approving the partition as set forth in said agreement. Pursuant to such agreement and order of the court approving the same, and after all of the liabilities under which said estate lay had been fully paid and satisfied, the said Doroteo Velasco, as said administrator, delivered to the devisees and legatees of the said Mariano Ocampo, deceased, all of the property of said decedent pursuant to the terms of said agreement of partition, leaving in the hands of said administrator no property or thing of value whatever belonging to said estate. From that time forward said administrator has not had in his possession or control any of the assets of the said estate and has not had any participation in the management thereof. At the time the agreement for partition was made and signed and at the time of the distribution of the property of the estate pursuant thereto, no committee had been appointed to hear claims against the estate of the said Mariano Ocampo, deceased, and no notice had been published to creditors of the said deceased to present their claims against the said estate in the manner prescribed by law.<br\/><br\/>On the 30th of March, 1908, by virtue of an order made by the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, upon application of all parties interested, the said Engracio Palanca was removed from office as administrator of the estate of said Margarita Jose, deceased, and the plaintiff herein, Jose McMicking, was appointed in his stead. The said Palanca was removed from office by reason of the fact that he failed and refused to render an account of the property and funds of the estate of the said Margarita Jose, deceased, which had come into his possession as such administrator, and failed and refused, on order of the court, to deliver said property and funds or any portion thereof to the court or to the said Jose McMicking, his successor. Instead of so doing, he retained possession of said property and funds, absconded with the same, and never returned to the Philippine Islands. At the time of his removal he was indebted to the estate in the sum of P41,960.15, no part of which has ever been received by the estate or by its representative.<br\/><br\/>On the 30th of June, 1909, Jose McMicking, as administrator, made an application to the court for the appointment of commissioners of the estate of said Mariano Ocampo for the purpose of hearing claims against his estate. The commission having been appointed and qualified, a claim was presented to it by the plaintiff based upon the defalcation of said Engracio Palanca, as administrator with the will annexed of Margarita Jose, deceased, which claim was allowed by said commission and later approved by the court, which directed that said claim be paid by Doroteo Velasco, if he had sufficient funds to make such payment. No part of the sum thus found to be due by the commission has been paid to the representative of the estate of said Margarita Jose, deceased.<br\/><br\/>On the 3d of November, 1905, Pio de la Guardia Barretto, who, it will be remembered, was one of the sureties on the undertaking of Doroteo Velasco, as administrator with the will annexed of Mariano Ocampo, deceased, died in the city of Manila, leaving an estate consisting of real and personal property located in said city. Said deceased left a will which was admitted to probate by the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila on the 3rd day of February, 1906, and letters of administration with the will annexed were issued to Benito Sy Conbieng, the defendant in this case. On the 4th of June, 1909, upon the application of the plaintiff in this case, a committee was appointed by the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila to appraise the estate of the said Pio de la Guardia Barretto, deceased, and to hear claims presented against his estate. Thereafter and within the time prescribed by law the plaintiff herein presented to said committee a claim for the sum of P30,000 \"based upon the fact that a claim for a larger amount had been allowed in favor of the estate of said Margarita Jose, deceased, against the estate of the said Mariano Ocampo Lao Sempco, deceased;\" and based upon the further fact \"that the Court of First Instance had ordered the said Doroteo Velasco, as administrator of the estate of said Mariano Ocampo Lao Sempco, deceased, to pay the said claim if there were funds sufficient to make such payment, but that it has not been paid by the said Doroteo Velasco, or any part thereof.\" The claim so presented against the estate of Pio de la Guardia Barretto, deceased, was disallowed by the committee thereof. The plaintiff herein within the time allowed by law appealed to the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila from the order of the committee disallowing said claim.<br\/><br\/>It is undisputed in the case that all of the claims against the estate of Mariano Ocampo were fully paid and satisfied at the time of the partition of said estate, with the exception of the alleged claim arising by virtue of his having been a surety of the defaulting Palanca. It nowhere appears in the evidence or the record exactly when this claim arose except it may be inferred from the time of presentation in 1909, and we have no means of determining whether the defalcation represented by the said claim occurred before or after the substitution of sureties heretofore referred to.<br\/><br\/>Upon these facts it was contended by counsel for plaintiff that judgment should be rendered in his favor for the sum of P30,000, with costs, while counsel for defendant contended that upon said facts judgment should be rendered in favor of defendant, dismissing the complaint, with costs. The court, having heard the evidence and the arguments of counsel, rendered judgment in favor of defendant and against plaintiff, dismissing the complaint upon the merits, without costs. This appeal is from that judgment.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that the judgment must be affirmed. We base our affirmance upon the ground that Doroteo Velasco, for whom the deceased Pio de la Guardia Barretto was surety, would not have been liable himself had this action been commenced against him. If the principal is not liable upon the obligation, the surety cannot be.<br\/><br\/>At the head of the law of administration of the Philippine Islands stand sections 596 and 597 of the Code of Civil Procedure. They are as follows:<br\/><blockquote> \"SEC. 596. <i>Settlement of intestate estates, without legal proceedings, in certain cases<\/i>.\u2014Whenever all the heirs of a deceased person are of lawful age and legal capacity, and there are no debts due from the intestate estate, or all the debts have been paid by the heirs, the heirs may, by a family council as known under Spanish law, or by agreement between themselves, duly executed in writing, apportion and divide the estate among themselves, as they may see fit, without proceedings in court.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 597. <i>In such case distributees liable for debts<\/i>.\u2014 But if it shall appear, at any time within two years after such settlement and distribution of the estate, that there are debts outstanding against the estate which have not been paid, any creditor may compel the settlement of the estate in the courts in the manner hereinafter provided, unless his debt shall be paid, with interest; and the administrator appointed by the court may recover the assets of the estate from those who have received them, for the purpose of paying the debts; and the real estate belonging to the deceased shall remain charged with the liability to creditors for the full period of two years after such distribution, notwithstanding any transfers thereof that may have been made.\"<\/blockquote>These sections provide for the voluntary division of the whole property of the decedent without proceedings in court. The provisions which they contain are extremely important. The wisdom which underlies them is apparent. It is the undisputed policy of every people which maintains the principle of private ownership of property that he who owns a thing shall not be deprived of its possession or use except for the most urgent and imperative reasons and then only so long as is necessary to make the rights which underlie those reasons effective. It is a principle of universal acceptance which declares that one has the instant right to occupy and use that which he owns, and it is only in the presence of reasons of the strongest and most urgent nature that that principle is prevented from accomplishing the purpose which underlies it. The force which gave birth to this stern and imperious principle is the same force which destroyed the feudal despotism and created the democracy of private owners.<br\/><br\/>These provisions should, therefore, be given the most liberal construction so that the intent of the framers may be fully carried out. They should not be straitened or narrowed but should rather be given that wideness and fullness of application without which they cannot produce their most beneficial effects.<br\/><br\/>Standing, as we have said, at the head of the law of administration of these Islands, they are the first provisions to which our attention is directed in seeking a legal method for the division and distribution of the property of deceased persons. They are thus made prominent. And justly so. The purpose which underlies them, as we have already intimated, is to put into one's hands the property which belongs to him not only at the earliest possible moment but also with the least possible expense. By permitting the partition and division without proceedings in court no time is lost and substantially all expense and waste are saved. This is as it should be. The State fails wretchedly in its duty to its citizens if the machinery furnished by it for the division and distribution of the property of a decedent is so cumbersome, unwieldy and expensive that a considerable portion of the estate is absorbed in the process of such division. Where administration is necessary, it ought to be accomplished quickly and at very small expense; and a system which consumes any considerable portion of the property which it was designed to distribute is a failure. It being undoubted that the removal of property from the possession of its owner and its deposit in the hands of another for administration is a suspension of some of his most important rights of property and is attended with an expense sometimes entirely useless and unnecessary, such procedure should be avoided whenever and wherever possible.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar we are of the opinion that, under the broad and liberal policy which we must adopt in the interpretation and application of the provisions referred to, the division of the property of Mariano Ocampo, deceased, in the form, in the manner and for the purposes expressed, falls within the provisions of said sections and may be termed, therefore, and we hold it to be, a partition of the property of a decedent without legal proceedings within the meaning of those sections. The fact of the prior appointment of an administrator and the filing of an inventory before such partition is of no consequence so far as the right of the owners to partition is concerned. The only requisite for such petition prescribed by the law is that \"there are no debts * * * or all the debts have been paid by the heirs.\" When this condition is fulfilled the partition can take place, no matter what stage the administration may have reached. By this it is, of course, not meant that the partition after the appointment of an administrator will interfere with the rights acquired by third persons dealing with said administrator within the limits of his authority and prior to the partition; nor that the administrator can be deprived of the property of which he is legally in possession without proper proceedings and the consent of the court.<br\/><br\/>As we have already indicated, the basis of the liability of a surety on an administrator's bond is the fault or failure of the principal The liability of the principal precedes that of the surety. If Velasco incurred no liability, then his surety incurred none. The question that naturally suggests itself is, then, In what was Velasco at fault or in what did he fail? When the persons interested in the estate of Mariano Ocampo agreed voluntarily upon a partition and division of the property of said estate and the actual partition followed, the matter passed out of the hands of Velasco as administrator. The parties to the partition stood invoking their rights under sections 596 and 597. Velasco was helpless. He was powerless to prevent the parties from taking the property to which they were entitled under the agreement, it being conceded that they were actually entitled thereto in law. Those sections were applicable to the situation and there was nothing that Velasco could do to prevent the estate from being divided according to their provisions. In giving his consent to the partition and in assisting the parties to obtain the approval of the court thereto he did no wrong. He simply aided,in carrying out the provisions of the sections referred to. It is a universal principle that one who follows a law commits no fault, incurs no failure and wounds no rights. If one obeys the law he is free not only in person but in property. Observance of the law discharges obligations; it does not create them; and an obligation once discharged cannot be re-created by the act of others in which the person as to whom it was discharged takes no part. The proceedings under the sections referred to were, after the partition was actually made and the property duly turned over by the administrator under the proper proceedings, a complete settlement of the estate of Mariano Ocampo, deceased, as it then stood, so far as the administrator was concerned. Nothing further needed to be done. Every duty which Velasco owed up to the time of the partition had been met. All debts presented or known had been paid. The court had given its approbation to the delivery of the property by the administrator to the partitioning parties. Every obligation which lay upon him had been removed. Nor could there arise against him any obligation in the future in relation to the same property. The instant that the partition occurred, in the form and manner stated, he stood stripped of all responsibility to the estate, to its creditors, to the heirs and to the court. He stood divested of every official duty and obligation, as fully as before his appointment\u2014as completely as if he had not been appointed at all. In law, therefore, he was no longer administrator with the will annexed of the estate of Mariano Ocampo, deceased. He was in effect, discharged. As to him the estate had been wiped out as a legal entity. It had ceased to exist. And, while at any time within two years after the partition the property, or a portion thereof, then in the possession of the partitioning persons could have been placed in administration upon the happening of certain events, it would not have been the same estate that had been represented by Velasco, nor would Velasco have been the administrator of the new estate by virtue of his appointment in the old. It would have been necessary for the court, upon the proper application setting forth the conditions prescribed by the sections, to appoint another administrator for the purposes specified therein. It might have been Velasco, if he would have accepted the appointment, or it might have been another. The point is <i>that it would have been necessary to appoint a new administrator<\/i> just as if one had not been named before. The new administrator would have had new duties, some of which would have been quite different from those of the administrator appointed originally. He would have had different sureties, who would have bound themselves to different obligations.<br\/><br\/>That on the partition under said sections the estate was, in this case, completely wiped out and the administrator as completely discharged cannot be doubted for the following reasons:<br\/><br\/>1. The whole estate was, by virtue of these sections, taken from the administrator and turned over to the partitioning persons. No security was required or given for its safekeeping or return.<br\/><br\/>2. The persons to whom the estate was thus turned over became absolute owners of the same, subject to be divested, wholly or only partly, on the happening of certain events and the taking of certain proceedings thereon. But even such divestiture could have been avoided by the payment by the parties, or any of them, of the debt which was the moving cause thereof.<br\/><br\/>From these premises it is the merest conclusion to say that the decedent's estate was merged in the partitioning parties; and this no matter whether the partition occurred before or after the appointment of an administrator. When one has been named to perform certain acts in relation to a given thing, and before said acts have been begun, or, having been begun, are completed, the appointing power has placed the thing upon which those acts were to operate wholly beyond the possession, jurisdiction and control of the one so appointed, there is a complete revocation of such appointment, so far as all subsequent acts are concerned. An administrator cannot be held to any accountability for property over which he has absolutely no power or jurisdiction and in which he has not the slightest legal interest. The thing on which he was appointed to operate having been withdrawn wholly beyond his ken by the very power (the law) which appointed him, there is a complete revocation of the original appointment.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, the sureties of an administrator so appointed can not be held liable for property which by force of law has been taken from the principal and its ownership and control turned over to others. Their obligation is that their principal shall obey the law in the handling and distribution of the estate. Their obligation is discharged when the estate is legally turned over to those entitled thereto. The law requires the principal to turn it over to those who bring themselves within the provisions of section 596. Having turned over the whole estate under the compelling power of the law, his obligation ceased. The responsibility of the sureties ceased at the same time. Without their consent another obligation could not be imposed upon them in relation to the same principal, and the same property, or a part thereof, especially after the lapse of two years. Their undertaking was that their principal should discharge one obligation, not two.<br\/><br\/>It requires no argument to demonstrate that the duties and obligations imposed upon an administrator appointed under section 597 might and probably would be different in many respects from those of an administrator appointed in the first instance; and that, therefore, the obligation of his sureties would not be the same as that of the sureties of the administrator appointed originally. The administration contemplated by section 597 is a new administration and one entirely apart from any other administration theretofore had. This section requires the appointment of a new administrator, with a new undertaking. The administration under that section is distinct and separate from any administration which may have been in progress at the time of the partition and division under section 596. This is clear for the following reasons:<br\/><br\/>After the partition and division provided for in sections 596 and 597 have been fully consummated, no further administration of the estate can be had unless there occur the following requisites:<br\/><br\/>1. There must have been discovered a claim against the estate \"within two years after such settlement and distribution of the estate.\"<br\/><br\/>2. The creditor holding the claim must be the person who moves the court for the appointment of an administrator.<br\/><br\/>If those requisites are lacking, there can be no administration. When one fails the right to such administration does not arise and any person interested in the estate may oppose any effort to administer under such circumstances. These requisites combined are that and that alone which give to the administrator when appointed the right to recover the assets from the persons who received them on the partition. Indeed, if these requisites are lacking <i>no administrator can lawfully be appointed<\/i>, and, if improperly appointed, he fails of legal power to maintain an action to recover the assets in the hands of those among whom they have been partitioned; in other words, he is powerless to administer. If these requisites fail, then the real estate in the hands either of the persons among whom it has been partitioned or of their assignees is free from the lien created by section 597 and any attempt to enforce such lien can be successfully opposed by any person interested in such property. The appointment of an administrator without the concurrence of these requisites is without warrant of law and the appointee is powerless to perform any act of administration. The statute must be strictly complied with in every essential before it operates. Every essential requirement must be fulfilled before it will be permitted that a partition which has the clear sanction of the law and which is strictly in accord with public policy of the state shall be set aside and destroyed with all the evil consequences thereby entailed.<br\/><br\/>It is a necessary deduction from the provisions of the sections mentioned that the appointment of an administrator ought not to be permitted, even when the requisites above mentioned concur, unless the heirs or the persons among whom the property was partitioned have been given an opportunity to be heard on that application. It would be extremely unusual to proceed to the appointment of an administrator under section 597, by virtue of a debt which had been discovered after the partition and division, without giving the heirs an opportunity to avoid such administration by the payment of the debt, it being kept in view that the object of the law in originally giving the right to pay the debts and have partition without proceedings in court was to avoid that very administration. Such a proceeding would be unusual and irrational. Such a course would be in direct opposition to the purposes which animated the provisions authorizing the original partition.<br\/><br\/>(1) In the case at bar no debt was discovered during the prescribed period. It was nearly four years after the partition of the estate and the taking possession by the heirs of their respective portions before it was even discovered that Palanca had been guilty of converting the property of the estate to his own use; and, so far as the record shows, it was nearly five years before the alleged claim against the estate of Mariano Ocampo was fixed.<br\/><br\/>(2) No creditor made his application. The requirements of section 597 not having been met, there could be no administration under said section. Therefore, the appointment of commissioners for the hearing of the claim against the estate of Mariano Ocampo presented by the plaintiff in this case was an appointment without warrant or authority of law. It was an appointment in respect to an estate <i>that did not exist<\/i> and in relation to an administration <i>that had never been inaugurated<\/i>. Under section 597 the commencement of the administration is the application of the creditor and the appointment of the administrator pursuant to such application. Without such appointment there is no administration. As we have before stated, when the property was partitioned as described heretofore, the estate, as such, ceased to exist and the administration thereof by Doroteo Velasco was wiped out. There was no administrator to carry on an administration. By operation of law the estate had been passed on to the heirs who had become the absolute owners of it. They were not subject to the orders of the old administrator and they held rights inferior to no one. To be sure, as we have already stated, those rights might be modified to a certain extent by the happening of subsequent events; but until those events transpired their rights were absolute. Those conditions never having been met, a fact admitted by both parties in the case at bar, there was absolutely no estate at all, much less one in the process of administration, at the time the commissioners were appointed to hear the claim for P30,000 presented against the estate of Mariano Ocampo, deceased, by the plaintiff herein. Add to this the fact that there was no administrator of said estate in existence at the time, and we have before us the absurdity of the appointment of the commissioners to report on a claim against an estate which did not exist and under the direction of an administrator that had never been appointed.<br\/><br\/>The necessary conclusion is that the appointment of commissioners to hear the claim above referred to was beyond the powers of the court and was without jurisdiction. The finding of the commissioners had no force or effect. It gave no rights against the estate and none against the so-called administrator.<br\/><br\/>It must be remembered that it is only debts discovered within the prescribed period that can be made the reason for an administration of the estate subsequent to its partition. The' necessary result is that a debt not discovered within that period cannot be made the reason for an administration of the estate. The debt in the case at bar having first been discovered more than four years after the partition of the estate of Mariano Ocampo, deceased, an administrator, even though appointed under section 597, would have no authority in law, over the objection of one interested, to pay the debt in question or to maintain an action or other proceeding for the recovery of property for that purpose. This section creates a statute of limitations which deprives all debts which are not discovered within the prescribed time of the power of requiring an administration of the estate. The administration of the estate after the partition under the law has been accomplished depends upon the discovery of the debt \"at any time within two years after such settlement and distribution of the estate.\" The law does not operate unless that discovery is made within the time prescribed.<br\/><br\/>We have not overlooked the contention that at the time this partition took place there was a contingent claim against the estate partitioned, namely, the claim which would arise on the contingency that the administrator for whom Mariano Ocampo was surety might default or other wise fail to perform his duties thus rendering Mariano Ocampo liable on his bond; and that said contingent claim, being one expressly recognized by sections 746 to 749 of the Code of Civil Procedure as a claim entirely proper to present, no partition of this estate under section 596 and 597 was legally possible until such claim was provided for by the partitioning parties. This contention goes upon the assumption that a partition under the sections of the Code of Civil Procedure so often referred to is void unless every debt is paid or provided for by the partitioning parties, and may therefore be entirely disregarded by the creditor holding a claim either unpaid or unprovided for. We do not believe that this assumption is warranted. In the first place, we must remember that the partition proceedings in question are proceedings out of court Consequently there is no prescribed method of ascertaining and settling claims. The appointment of commissioners, the publication of notice to creditors, and all the other proceedings necessary in cases of administration <i>in court<\/i> are not required in partition <i>out of court<\/i>. The law is silent as to how the claims are to be ascertained, presented and determined. We must assume, therefore, that the method of ascertaining them and determining their validity was left to the good sense and sound judgment of the persons concerned. Usually no difficulty will be experienced in solving the problem presented by this conclusion. It is obvious that creditors always know who owes them and that debtors generally know whom they owe. It is equally obvious that, generally speaking, a creditor is one of the first to learn of the death of his debtor, and that heirs of the latter are the first to begin to calculate how much of his property they are to receive. This cannot be known until the debts are determined. The heirs know they cannot escape payment of the debts. A surreptitious division behind the backs of the creditors would not avail as the latter have two years thereafter in which to throw at least a portion of the estate into administration and thereby nullify the attempt to overreach them. Even the transfer by the partitioning persons of the property received on the partition to third persons would not profit them, inasmuch as the consideration received on such transfer would, if necessary, be subject to seizure to pay the debt presented and the real estate would go into the hands of the vendees charged with the lien of said debt.<br\/><br\/>The method of ascertaining claims against the decedent's estate not being prescribed, it is apparent that no objection to a partition can be urged by a creditor whose claim has not been paid, due to the faulty method adopted by the partitioning parties to ascertain claims, or, even, the absence of any effort at all to ascertain them.<br\/><br\/>In the second place, it must be observed that express provision is made by sections 596 and 597 for the payment of a claim discovered by them or presented <i>after the partition<\/i>. That is one of the main provisions. It is a necessary deduction, therefore, that it was not the intention of the law to pronounce the partition void or of no effect simply because not all of the debts were, paid before the partition was made. The fact of nonpayment cannot, then, be used by the creditor as a reason for attacking the partition <i>directly<\/i>; that is, by asserting that, inasmuch as a payment of all the debts is a condition precedent to the right of partition, such partition cannot legally and validly take place while a debt is outstanding. While a partition manifestly fraudulent in inception and result might possibly be attacked directly by an action to set aside, a question which we do not discuss or decide, the manner of attacking the partition prescribed by law is the one, generally speaking, preferably to be followed; and that is to throw into administration so much of the estate as is necessary to pay the outstanding claim. The method, though <i>indirect<\/i>, accomplishes a better result than a <i>direct<\/i> attack. The latter, by destroying the validity of the partition, would throw the whole situation into confusion and uncertainty, something always to be avoided. The former does not produce that result. Where there is no fraud, and possibly where there is, a direct attack on the partition is impossible under the provisions under discussion. A claim discovered and presented within the two years serves not to destroy, primarily, the partition. It does not even permit the whole estate to be thrown into administration. Only such portion as is necessary to pay the discovered debt can be administered. This is apparent when it is observed that on such administration the administrator is authorized to recover <i>only the amount of property necessary to pay the debt presented<\/i>, leaving the partitioning parties in undisturbed possession of the remainder. Moreover, the partitioning parties may still pay the debt and preserve undisturbed the partition in all its parts and thus assure and maintain the rights of the parties thereunder. The mere fact, therefore, that a creditor was not paid before the partition took place furnishes no ground for a revocation of the partition. It simply provides a fact which he may urge as a reason for the appointment of an administrator and the consequent administration of so much of the estate as may be necessary to pay the debt discovered.<br\/><br\/>But, as already seen, in order that it be a reason for such appointment and administration, <i>the claim must be presented within two years<\/i> from the date of the partition and distribution.<br\/><br\/>Summarizing, we have seen that lack of opportunity, either by want of notice or otherwise, and the consequent failure to present a claim before partition, is, under the sections we are discussing, of no consequence whatever in so far as the <i>validity<\/i> of the partition is concerned.<br\/><br\/>We have also seen that the fact that there were debts outstanding and unpaid at the time the partition took place is of no importance so far as the <i>validity<\/i> of the partition is concerned, leaving out of account the question of fraud to which we have already adverted and left undecided.<br\/><br\/>We have also seen that the fact that such claim exists and is valid and subsistent against the estate is of no consequence whatever with respect to the right of its holder to require an administration of the estate <i>unless such claim is discovered and presented within two years<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The fact that the claim in the case at bar was, during a certain period, a contingent one is of no importance. The sections under discussion make no distinction between claims.<br\/><br\/>The creditor himself is not without duties. In the case at bar it was five years after the partition before the alleged creditor made any attempt whatever to \"discover\" or present his claim. He knew of the death of Ocampo very soon after it occurred. He knew that it was among the possibilities that Ocampo's estate might be called upon to respond for the failure of Palanca to perform his duty as administrator. It was his duty to see to it that he would be protected in that event. Nevertheless he permitted the estate of Ocampo to be partitioned and distributed without protest and without the presentation of his contingent claim, and sat quiet and passive for nearly five years thereafter knowing that it was very probable that the property of the estate was being consumed, incumbered, and transferred by the persons among whom it had been distributed.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa<\/i>, and <i>Johnson, JJ.<\/i>, concur. <i> <br\/>Carson<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur as to the dispositive part.<\/div>",

The debt was to be paid three months  after it had been assumed  by the new debtor, Potenciano Roxas, which was on June 4,  1907.<\/p>\n<p>The Manila commercial firm of Hidalgo, Cuyugan &amp; Co. was the creditor of Potenciano Roxas and by entering suit in the Court of First Instance of Manila  obtained judgment for the payment of its  bill amounting to P724.98, with interest at 6 per cent per annum from January 10, 1908, and the costs.   This judgment was rendered on February 20 and execution ordered May  21, 1908.<\/p>\n<p>Manuel E.  Cuyugan also secured judgments against Potenciano Roxas in the justice of the peace court of Manila in four suits, three for P500 and one for P340 with interest at 6 per cent per annum from January 9,  1908, and the costs. These judgments were  rendered January 17 and  execution ordered May  21, 1908.<\/p>\n<p>On May 27, 1908, the sheriff of the Province of Bulacan levied upon  (<em>a<\/em>) a steam engine and rice mill, and (<em>b<\/em>) a house of  mixed materials  and an  iron-roofed warehouse beside it, and other equipment for cleaning rice.<\/p>\n<p>The Manila firm of Castle Bros-Wolf &amp; Sons laid claim to all the  machinery specified under (<em>a<\/em>)  and the creditors Hidalgo, Cuyugan  &amp; Co., and Manuel E. Cuyugan admitted this claim.<\/p>\n<p>On June 26, 1908, the said property was sold at public auction  by the sheriff of Bulacan and  adjudicated in  payment: The machinery under  (a)  to Castle Bros-Wolf &amp; Sons, and the house, warehouse and other equipment under (b) to the judgment creditors Hidalgo,  Cuyugan &amp; Co,, and Manuel  E. Cuyugan, for the  amounts of their respective judgments.<\/p>\n<p>On June 27, 1908, the day after the auction, the sheriff issued to the respective  bidders, who had bought the property, the corresponding  bills  of sale.<\/p>\n<p>The first time that Maria Esguerra  appears is on June 25, 1908, when she claims preference in payment over the bills  of  Hidalgo, Cuyugan &amp; Co., and Manuel E.  Cuyugan, no mention being made of Castle Bros-Wolf &amp; Sons, asking the sheriff to keep  in his possession the proceeds of the sale of said property and then to pay her bill of P1,612, with legal interest and costs, in preference to Hidalgo, Cuyugan &amp; Co., and Manuel  E.  Cuyugan.<\/p>\n<p>The sheriff  was not notified or enjoined until June 29, 1908, when the sale had already been consummated and the corresponding bills of sale issued to the vendees.<\/p>\n<p>The Court of First Instance of Bulacan rendered judgment absolving Mariano Tecson Roxas and the  sheriff of the Province of Bulacan from the complaint and sentencing Potenciano Roxas  to pay to  Maria Esguerra P1,612  with legal interest from the date of the filing  of the complaint and declaring the plaintiff's bill to have preference over the bills of the defendants  Hidalgo,  Cuyugan &amp; Co., and Manuel E. Cuyugan, against  the defendant Potenciano Roxas.<\/p>\n<p>As not  only the  warehouse in question but also a house of mixed materials and other property, described under  the letter (b), was adjudicated to Messrs. Hidalgo, Cuyugan &amp; Co. and Manuel E. Cuyugan, only for the sum of Pl,564.98, less than the plaintiff's bill of P1,612, they were sentenced to turn over to the plaintiff enough from  the price of  the warehouse to satisfy the bill ordered paid to her, or otherwise the warehouse itself, with  the costs of the case, in equal parts, against Potenciano Roxas, Hidalgo, Cuyugan &amp; Co., and Manuel E. Cuyugan.   (B. of E.)<\/p>\n<p>This judgment was appealed from by the plaintiff as well as by the  defendants Hidalgo, Cuyugan &amp; Co., and Manuel E.  Cuyugan, both parties filing  bills of exceptions.  The plaintiff asked that the defendants mentioned be compelled to deliver to her P1,612, which was in  their possession as part of the price of said property,  without the option of turning over to her the warehouse  dealt with in the judgment.  The defendants asked that the judgment be annulled in so far as it granted to the plaintiff preference in payment of her bill against the property already adjudicated through public auction, or against the price secured at the auction or a portion thereof.<\/p>\n<p>In deciding both appeals, it  is necessary  to observe:<\/p>\n<p>First, When on June 29,1908, the sheriff was notified and enjoined to retain  in his possession  the price he might secure from the auction, it was then impossible to do so, for it had been collected and paid to the  judgment creditors on  the 27th  preceding.  Accordingly, the  complaint was wholly inoperative and the court could not definitely order  the sheriff to hold in his possession what had already in a just and legal manner, by payment of an execution, passed into the hands of the judgment creditors.<\/p>\n<p>Second.  After the proceeds  of the execution are in their possession  by virtue of final judgment,  execution, auction, and payment, there is no valid reason why they  should  not keep what they have justly collected or be obliged to return what they have received in payment of their bill.<\/p>\n<p>Third. Still less  can they be obliged to turn over to any one the piece of real property  which they bought at a legal and valid  public auction, after they have received the bill of sale, through which they have acquired all the  right, interest, title, and  rights  of  action  which  the judgment debtor had over the same (Code of Civil Procedure,  sec. 463),  and  which have not been overthrown  in any suit for nullifying  or rescinding the sale at public auction by which they acquired them.<\/p>\n<p>Fourth.  Even admitting that the plaintiff's bill should really  have preference over that  of the defendants,  such preference can not afford  legal ground for annulling judgments and executions  already  terminated,  as  though  the petition of a less preferred creditor in his own right signified nothing in the eyes of the law,  when it is  a  well-known maxim that vigilanti prospiciunt jura; that is, that the  law protects him who is watchful of his rights.<\/p>\n<p>Fifth. It is wholly improper, in such a state of affairs and accomplished  facts,  to  permit discussion of  the preference of claims, which would  have been in order before judgment and payment.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, the findings  of the judgment  appealed from by the defendants,  which  declare the plaintiff's claim to have preference in payment and which order them to turn over to the plaintiff either  enough of the  price of the warehouse  to pay the bill adjudicated to her, or  the warehouse itself,  are  hereby reversed, without  special  findings as to costs in this second instance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent,  JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Exhibit A is an order of the justice\u00a0 of the peace of said pueblo transferring the hearing of the cause against Austria from the 12th to the 16th of October, 1908.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the facts contained in Exhibits A and B presented by the defense, Benigno Lucero and Esteban Larbsa deny positively that such complaint\u00a0 was ever\u00a0 presented against Francisco Austria.\u00a0 Francisco Austria's name also appears upon the different orders found in Exhibits A and B made by the justice of the peace.<\/p><p> The defendant herein testified, and the fact is not denied, that flrior to the time of the trial of the cause commenced, against Francisco Austria, certain charges had\u00a0 been preferred against\u00a0 him (the defendant) for administrative investigation and for that reason he had directed his auxiliary justice of the peace to take charge of\u00a0 and conduct all proceedings pending\u00a0 in the office\u00a0 of the\u00a0 justice\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 peace of said pueblo.<\/p><p> The appellant alleges that Francisco Austria,\u00a0 whom he had dismissed as his clerk or escribiente, had\u00a0 willfully and maliciously instituted not only the present action, pending against him, but all of the charges which had been presented for administrative investigation.<\/p><p> In view of the fact that the prosecuting witnesses in the present action, Benigno Lucero and Esteban\u00a0 Larosa, had, nearly a year prior to the commencement of the present action, caused a complaint to be presented against Francisco Austria, charging him with the same crime which now they impute to the defendant, we are inclined to believe that the allegations in the\u00a0 complaint in the'present action are not true and that the theory of the defendant that the present proceedings were brought solely for the purpose of annoying and prejudicing him, is true.<\/p><p> Without discussing the assignments of error presented here by the appellant, and in view of the proof contained in Exhibits A and B of the\u00a0 defense, we are of the opinion that the defendant is not guilty of the crime\u00a0 charged and that the complaint against him should be dismissed and that he should be discharged from the custody of the law, with costs <em>de oficio<\/em>.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

appeal from a judgment of conviction rendered by the Honorable Simplicio del Rosario, judge.<p>About half past 7 o'clock\u00a0 in the morning\u00a0 of July 30, 1910,\u00a0 while the unmarried girl, Ana Arasigan,\u00a0 a\u00a0 minor 14 years\u00a0 of age, was walking along\u00a0 San\u00a0 Sebastian street, on her way from Sampaloc to the millinery store named \"Chic Parisien,\" situated in this city on\u00a0 the Escolta, where she worked as a seamstress, Valentin Bernabe, who was accompanying her, advised her, on the pretext that it was very late, to take a vehicle in order that she might get to the store quickly.\u00a0 The\u00a0 girl,\u00a0 therefore,\u00a0 hailed\u00a0 a <em>carromata<\/em> which was going by and immediately got into it; but when the vehicle\u00a0 had gone a\u00a0 short way, Bernabe suddenly entered the <em>carromata<\/em> also, sat down beside her and\u00a0 immediately ordered\u00a0 the driver to go toward San Miguel\u00a0 and the Ayala Bridge,\u00a0 and, notwithstanding that the girl tried to have\u00a0 the\u00a0 vehicle stopped in order\u00a0 thak she might get out of it, as it was not being driven to\u00a0 the\u00a0 Escolta,\u00a0 the driver, by order of Valentin Bernabe, continued to go on until they arrived\u00a0 at the pueblo of Pasig.\u00a0\u00a0 On the way the girl\u00a0 made no\u00a0 outcries,\u00a0 through\u00a0 the fear of creating a scene, and her abductor assured her that upon their arrival at Pasig they should be married, to which she replied that she was unwilling.\u00a0 As\u00a0 soon as they\u00a0 arrived at the said pueblo, the defendant had the <em>carromata<\/em> stopped in front of a house into which he endeavored to\u00a0 make her enter,\u00a0 and as the girl refused to get out of the vehicle Bernabe\u00a0 caught her by\u00a0 the hand\u00a0 and pulled her, compelling her by\u00a0 the use of violence to get out\u00a0 of the\u00a0 <em>carromata,<\/em> for\u00a0 one of her slippers\u00a0 fell to the ground.\u00a0 At this moment the\u00a0 girl began to cry, on which account, before the abducted party had entered the said house and while she was near the stairs in view\u00a0 of\u00a0 a woman who\u00a0 was looking\u00a0 at them from a window\u00a0 above, a\u00a0 neighbor,\u00a0 who\u00a0 had\u00a0 seen\u00a0 what had\u00a0 occurred, called the policeman Esteban Santos, who conducted both the girl and\u00a0 her abductor to the municipal building of Pasig, and as there were many\u00a0 people in the justice of the peace court, he took the girl thence to the house of a physician where she remained until 7 o'clock that evening, when her mother,\u00a0 Tomasa Garcia, who had been searching for her daughter,\u00a0 came there and took charge of her.<\/p><p>For the foregoing\u00a0 reasons, and in\u00a0 view of the\u00a0 preliminary investigations made at the request of the abducted girl's\u00a0 mother, an\u00a0 information was filed\u00a0 in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, by the provincial fiscal, charging Valentin Bernabe with the crime of abduction,\u00a0 and,\u00a0 this cause haying\u00a0 been\u00a0 tried, the court, on January\u00a0 27, 1911, pronounced judgment therein by sentencing the defendant to the penalty of one year eight\u00a0 months and\u00a0 twenty-one days of <em>prision correccional,<\/em> to the accessory penalties and to payment of the costs, from which judgment the defendant appealed.<\/p><p>The acts\u00a0 aforestated\u00a0 are\u00a0 in\u00a0 fact characteristic of the crime of abduction, provided for and\u00a0 punished by article 446 of the Penal Code, committed with\u00a0 the offended party's assent and with unchaste\u00a0 designs, inasmuch as the girl, Ana Arasigan, notwithstanding that she stated to her abductor that she was not willing to\u00a0 marry him, from the moment that the accused ordered that the vehicle be driven from Quiapo Square toward the pueblo of Pasig, without having\u00a0 heeded the\u00a0 desires\u00a0 and requests of the offended party that it be stopped so that she might get out, as it was\u00a0 not going toward the store on the Escolta, and being informed of the defendant's determination, did not protest, made no effort whatever to free herself from her abductor, and\u00a0 did not cry out to\u00a0 the passers by\u00a0 for help, while the vehicle was still being driven through such populous places as Quiapo\u00a0 Square and\u00a0 Echague and San\u00a0 Miguel streets, she giving her assent and keeping\u00a0 silent during so long a trip to Pasig when she could have attracted the notice, on the way, of some policeman\u00a0 or any passer-by, had she wished to beg help\u00a0 against the wrong\u00a0 that might be done her.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore it\u00a0 must be held that\u00a0 the girl was\u00a0 taken to Pasig with her assent, notwithstanding that she would not consent\u00a0 to\u00a0 the marriage suggested\u00a0 to her on the way by the accused.<\/p><p>The said article of the code does not expressly require that the circumstance of unchaste designs must be present in the\u00a0 commission\u00a0\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 crime\u00a0 of abduction punished thereby, since, according to the decision of the supreme court of Spain, rendered on November 30,1875, the doctrine was\u00a0 established, in\u00a0 treating\u00a0 of\u00a0 the application and\u00a0 fulfilment of the corresponding\u00a0 article in the\u00a0 Penal Code\u00a0 of Spain, that the purpose of the same was to provide punishment, not for the\u00a0 violence against the party\u00a0 abducted, especially when her assent\u00a0 is assumed,\u00a0 but for\u00a0 the insult to her family and the alarm caused to it by the disappearance\u00a0 of\u00a0 one of its\u00a0 members who, as well on account\u00a0 of her age as because of her sex, is more exposed to seduction and deceit;\u00a0 it being immaterial\u00a0 where the\u00a0 abduction\u00a0 is committed, the Penal Code makes no reference\u00a0 thereto.<\/p><p>On the hypothesis that, according to the rules in practice observed\u00a0 by the\u00a0 courts,\u00a0 abduction\u00a0 with assent must be accompanied by\u00a0 unchaste designs, it is therefore proper to affirm that the abduction under\u00a0 prosecution\u00a0 was committed with\u00a0 unchaste purposes and designs,\u00a0 inasmuch as the defendant, upon his arrival in Pasig with the offended party, instead of\u00a0 going to the court of\u00a0 the justice of the peace and presenting himself to that officer, who, he said, was an acquaintance of his, for the purpose of the celebration of the marriage promised the abducted\u00a0 girl,\u00a0 he conducted her to a house where he said an aunt of his lived, with\u00a0 the intention of lodging\u00a0 there\u00a0 and, undoubtedly, of carrying out his unchaste designs\u00a0 or purposes.<\/p><p>Had the defendant certainly entertained good and honest intentions toward the offended party, notwithstanding that, according to the latter, he was a mere acquaintance of hers, was not\u00a0 her suitor,\u00a0 and had never entered her house, the correct procedure for him would\u00a0 have been,\u00a0 after having obtained the girl's consent,\u00a0 to have spoken to her\u00a0 mother who, to judge from her\u00a0 testimony, perhaps would not have refused to consent to the marriage of the defendant with her daughter.\u00a0 Were it true that the sole intention of the accused in effecting\u00a0 the abduction was thus to enable him to be married by\u00a0 a\u00a0 duly authorized authority or minister of the gospel, he could\u00a0 very well\u00a0 have found\u00a0 such in this city, where ministers of\u00a0 different religious sects abound, without the need of\u00a0 taking the abducted girl to the pueblo of Pasig with the\u00a0 unlawful intent of\u00a0 placing\u00a0 her\u00a0 in\u00a0 a private house.\u00a0 The unchaste designs, which the accused undoubtedly had, were not manifested on account of the opportune intervention of a\u00a0 policeman as a\u00a0 result of a notice given him by a neighbor who saw the offended party crying and refusing to enter the said house in Pasig in which, had she done so, she would without doubt have been the victim of an unchaste attempt.<\/p><p>The defendant's guilt as the sole\u00a0 proved perpetrator of the\u00a0 crime under prosecution is very\u00a0 manifest, for notwithstanding his plea\u00a0 of not guilty,\u00a0 still the record of the case furnishes decisive and\u00a0 conclusive proof,\u00a0 which produces\u00a0 full conviction in the mind, that he did\u00a0 commit the crime\u00a0 charged; and the\u00a0 incriminating evidence\u00a0 adduced at the trial\u00a0 was not overcome\u00a0 nor weakened\u00a0 by his unproven exculpatory allegations.<\/p><p>In the commission of the crime, no extenuating\u00a0 or aggravating circumstance is to be considered; wherefore the penalty provided by law must be\u00a0 imposed upon\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 in the\u00a0 medium degree,\u00a0 as\u00a0 it was in the judgment appealed from.<\/p><p>With respect to the question of competency and\u00a0 jurisdiction, referred to in the first assignment of error alleged against the\u00a0 trial judge by the defendant's counsel, it must be taken into account that both the judges of the Courts of First Instance of Manila and of Rizal have jurisdiction and are competent to take cognizance of the crime of abduction. It is true that the abduction\u00a0 herein\u00a0 prosecuted was commenced in this city, but it may\u00a0 well be\u00a0 said it\u00a0 was consummated in Pasig, of the\u00a0 Province of Rizal, where the defendant was\u00a0 to carry out or intended to execute the unchaste\u00a0 designs, which\u00a0 his counsel ignored.\u00a0 The question of a judge's competency or incompetency is the first one that should opportunely be raised, in order to avoid the submission of the pase to a judge who, in the opinion of the\u00a0 defense, is incompetent\u00a0 and without jurisdiction\u00a0 to try the same.\u00a0 The fact is that such exception of incompetency was not taken in the first instance and the defendant submitted to the authority of the judge of the\u00a0 court of Rizal during the prosecution of the case, and only alleged it as an\u00a0 error\u00a0 incurred by the lower court in its judgment upon appeal in this second instance, wherefore\u00a0 it is improper because it was not made at the right time.<\/p><p>For the foregoing\u00a0 reasons, whereby the other errors assigned\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 appealed from are\u00a0 deemed to have been refuted, and holding\u00a0 that said judgment\u00a0 is in conformity with the law and the merits of the case, it\u00a0 is our\u00a0 opinion\u00a0 that the same\u00a0 should be,\u00a0 as it is hereby, affirmed, with\u00a0 the,costs of this instance against the appellant, who, in\u00a0 the\u00a0 imposition\u00a0 6f the penalty, shall be allowed credit for one-half of the time of imprisonment suffered by him while awaiting trial.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

In the case of the United States <em>vs<\/em>. Rodriguez (1 Phil. Rep., 107), this\u00a0 court,\u00a0 speaking through Mr. Justice Mapa, said:<\/p><p>The unchaste\u00a0 designs\u00a0 constitute one of the\u00a0 essential elements that characterize the crime of abduction, as well when\u00a0 committed\u00a0 with violence against the will of the woman as when carried out with her consent in case of her minority.\u00a0 This is precisely\u00a0 the point which constitutes one of the\u00a0 principal differences which distinguish\u00a0 this crime\u00a0 from crimes against personal liberty and\u00a0 security. If the removal of a woman from her house, although she be a virgin under the age of 23 years, is committed for the purpose of murdering her or demanding a ransom, or holding her a prisoner somewhere, it would undoubtedly constitute a crime but would by no mean fall under the provisions of the sections of the Penal\u00a0 Code which define and punish the crime of abduction, but\u00a0 of other section's quite distinct, although there exists in such case the material fact of the\u00a0 stealing away of a woman.\u00a0 This consideration demonstrates that the\u00a0 unchaste\u00a0 purpose\u00a0 is essential\u00a0 in all cases to the crime\u00a0 of abduction, and\u00a0 this same conclusion is deduced from the fact that the crime is classified\u00a0 in the code among the crimes against chastity.\"<\/p><p>That unchaste designs\u00a0 are a necessary or essential element in the\u00a0 crime of abduction has long since been definitely settled by this court.\u00a0 The question is no longer an open one, and this court, in now holding otherwise, is in direct\u00a0 conflict with every decision upon thev question\u00a0 that this court has rendered.\u00a0 Consequently, if the record in the case at bar fails to disclose that the\u00a0 appellant accompanied the offended\u00a0 party from the city of Manila to Pasig with unchaste designs, then he is not guilty of abduction.<\/p><p>The\u00a0 real question presented\u00a0 is one of fact; that is: Did the defendant take the offended party to Pasig for unchaste designs?\u00a0 In determining this\u00a0 question the court\u00a0 was not merely passing upon the credibility of witnesses, but it was necessary to pass on the reasonableness of the story told by the offended party.\u00a0\u00a0 Is her story, under the admitted facts, to be unreservedly accepted as true?\u00a0 The offended party admits\u00a0 and so testified\u00a0 that\u00a0 she entered the <em>carromata<\/em> voluntarily.\u00a0\u00a0 She also admits and so\u00a0 testified that she made no outcry nor any resistance whatever from the time she entered the <em>carromata<\/em> until the\u00a0 arrival of the couple in Pasig, and that there was nothing offensive in the conduct of the appellant during: this time.<\/p><p>The statement of facts adopted by the majority opinion is taken practically <em>in toto<\/em> from the\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 of Ana Arasigan, in the most part wholly unsupported by any other witness, interested or disinterested, and in great part flatly contradicted by the defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 The testimony of the latter is corroborated by apparently\u00a0 two disinterested witnesses who\u00a0 saw\u00a0 the\u00a0 couple enter\u00a0 the <em>carromata<\/em> on Calle San Sebastian, by the <em>cochero<\/em> who drove them to Pasig, also apparently disinterested,\u00a0 and by the woman of the\u00a0 house in Pasig where\u00a0 the defendant and his companion were arrested by the\u00a0 policeman.\u00a0 This woman is also an\u00a0 apparently\u00a0\u00a0 disinterested\u00a0\u00a0 witness.\u00a0 Ana\u00a0 Arasigan\u00a0 herself further made several admissions which tend to corroborate the testimony\u00a0 presented\u00a0 by the defense,\u00a0 and which also tend\u00a0 to\u00a0 seriously\u00a0 affect the\u00a0 credibility of\u00a0 her own story. It is simply a precaution against the miscarriage of justice to require\u00a0 that where the\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 of one witness\u00a0 is adopted\u00a0 as against that of several others, especially\u00a0 when those witnesses whose testimony\u00a0 is\u00a0 discountenanced\u00a0 by that of the single opposing witness are disinterested, to require that the latter give a\u00a0 consistent and reasonable account of the matter before the court, free from material contradictions.<\/p><p>In refutation of the statement of the girl that she was going to work\u00a0 on the morning in question, we have the testimony of the\u00a0 defendant that the preceding night they had planned to go to Pasig on the following\u00a0 day to get married\u00a0 and were to meet early on the morning of July 30th near\u00a0 the Sampaloc church for that\u00a0 purpose.\u00a0\u00a0 With reference to the entrance of the\u00a0 couple into a public <em>carromata<\/em>, the defendant\u00a0 states that he called the\u00a0 carromata. This statement is\u00a0 supported\u00a0 by the driver of the vehicle, Manuel Gomez,\u00a0 and Julian Tumali, a printer on his\u00a0 way to work, who\u00a0 knew the defendant, and who, on the trial,\u00a0 identified the girl.\u00a0 The defendant and these two witnesses, together with one\u00a0 Teodoro Alquiros,\u00a0 a laundryman,\u00a0 also on his way to work and who likewise\u00a0 knew the defendant and\u00a0 identified the\u00a0 girl\u00a0 at the trial,\u00a0 state that the\u00a0 two entered the <em>carromata<\/em> together.\u00a0 The\u00a0 driver of the <em>carromata<\/em> testified that on the way to Pasig\u00a0 the two in conversation\u00a0 talked of going to the house of the defendant's aunt to get married.\u00a0 He testified that the\u00a0 defendant made absolutely no threats\u00a0 and used\u00a0 no force while en route from Manila to Pasig.\u00a0 This testimony is, of\u00a0 course, corroborated by that of the defendant himself.\u00a0 The woman, Petra Loreto, testified\u00a0 that\u00a0 she was.\u00a0 a\u00a0 relative of the\u00a0 defendant's aunt but no relation of his.\u00a0\u00a0 She testified that she saw the <em>carromata<\/em>\u00a0 containing the\u00a0 couple\u00a0 arrive in front of\u00a0 her house; that the defendant informed her that\u00a0 they were looking for his aunt to accompany them to the <em>juzgado <\/em>as they were going to get married. She, in company with the <em>cochero<\/em>,\u00a0 testified that there\u00a0 was absolutely no force used on the part of the defendant to induce the girl Ana to alight and that the girl alighted first.\u00a0\u00a0 Petra. Loreto further testified that the girl alighted on the side nearest her house while the defendant alighted on the other side; that, after paying the driver of the <em>carromata<\/em>, the two\u00a0 ascended as far as the landing at the top of the stairs; that she would not permit them to\u00a0 enter her house because she did not\u00a0 know them; that just at that moment the policeman came and took both away with him.\u00a0 As to\u00a0 the slipper\u00a0 of the girl which the defendant had in his hand when the policeman arrived on the scene, this witness testified that\u00a0 in her haste to alight from the <em>carromata<\/em> the girl had left it within and that after reaching the stairway the defendant returned to the <em>carromata<\/em> to get the slipper.\u00a0 The statement in the opinion of the court that the girl refused to get out of the <em>carromata<\/em> and that thereupon this defendant caught her by the hand and compelled her to alight by the use of force and that one of her slippers fell to the ground during the struggle, is entirely dependent upon\u00a0 the statement of the\u00a0 girl herself. On the other hand, we have the testimony of the <em>cochero.<\/em>\u00a0 Gomez, and of the woman,\u00a0 Loreto, that the girl alighted unassisted and of her own free will.\u00a0 I submit that here is another\u00a0 highly improbable statement on the\u00a0 part of the girl, Ana.\u00a0 They stopped at\u00a0 the house in Pasig at about 8 o'clock in the morning.\u00a0 That both the defendant and the girl alighted is admitted.\u00a0 The driver of the <em>carromata<\/em> was certainly a witness to this scene.\u00a0 Is it probable that the defendant would\u00a0 have attempted anything so foolhardy in broad daylight in a populous town?\u00a0\u00a0 If he\u00a0 did use force, how much resistance did the\u00a0 girl offer?\u00a0 It is true that the attention of a neighbor was\u00a0 attracted to the pair and that he notified a policeman.\u00a0 But the latter states that when he arrived he saw no \"scandal.\" It is admitted that the girl reached\u00a0 the landing at the top of the stairway and that she was\u00a0 crying after alighting from\u00a0 the<em> carromata<\/em>.\u00a0 The mere fact that she was crying, and that she was a stranger in the neighborhood,\u00a0 would have been sufficient to arouse the suspicions of this neighbor.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the declaration of the girl,\u00a0 Ana, on the witness stand that she did not go to Pasig with this appellant of her own free will, this court has found as a fact that such was the case.\u00a0 As\u00a0 its\u00a0 reason for so holding, the court states that had she of a certainty not desired to accompany the accused to Pasig, she could very easily have called for assistance\u00a0 \"while\u00a0 the\u00a0 vehicle\u00a0 was still\u00a0 being driven through such populous places as Quiapo Square and Echague and San\u00a0 Miguel streets.\"\u00a0\u00a0 In this I agree.\u00a0 But the court holds that although she did accompany the accused voluntarily, she would n6t accept\u00a0 the defendant's proposals of marriage.\u00a0 What purpose had she then in riding with him? According to her story, she was leaving her work and traveling with\u00a0 a casual\u00a0 male acquaintance, who was importuning her with offers of marriage\u00a0 which were not agreeable to her, and\u00a0 yet,\u00a0 so the court holds,\u00a0 she went willingly.\u00a0 Such a hypothesis of the attitude of this young lady toward the appellant is untenable.\u00a0\u00a0 It is too\u00a0 inconsistent with feminine chastity and modesty, and I am not at all disposed to impute a want of these attributes to this young lady.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact that she accompanied him voluntarily and listened to his overtures of marriage, renders highly improbable her assertions that the defendant was merely a slight acquaintance, that she was going to work on the morning in question, and that on the way to Pasig she\u00a0 refused to entertain his\u00a0 offers of marriage.\u00a0 On the other hand, this fact fits in exactly with the testimony of the defendant to\u00a0 the\u00a0 effect that on\u00a0 the preceding night\u00a0 it was agreed between himself and this girl to go to Pasig and get married there, and that they went there with that object in view.\u00a0 The girl, Ana, further testified in her direct examination that she did\u00a0 not know\u00a0 the driver of the <em>carromata<\/em>.\u00a0\u00a0 On being recalled, she stated that she did remember the driver of the\u00a0 vehicle and on Manuel Gomez being presented, she testified that he was\u00a0 not that person.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is presumed that she meant by this\u00a0 that\u00a0 she remembered the <em>cochero<\/em>'<em>s <\/em>face but\u00a0 not his name.\u00a0 I have carefully noted the testimony of the witness Manuel Gomez. There is not a single contradiction in his declarations, and his story agrees\u00a0 in all material points with that of the other witnesses for the defense.\u00a0 As set\u00a0 forth\u00a0 above, the girl, Ana, in my opinion, mixed falsehood with fact in her direct testimony.\u00a0 Having\u00a0 so far departed from the truth, it is quite\u00a0 possible that she would go a little further and testify untruthfully about a matter in which she was almost sure to escape detection.\u00a0 Or adopting the most charitable view of the matter possible, her simple denial that Gomez was not the driver, in the face of the Iatter's statements, should be subject to the rule of\u00a0 positive and negative testimony, because the identity of the\u00a0 <em>cochero <\/em>was a matter about which she cannot be presumed to have made any careful observations.<\/p><p>Designs such\u00a0 as are imputed to\u00a0 the accused are vastly more\u00a0 easy to carry out at night when the danger of being discovered is reduced to a minimum; and an examination of the cases will show that\u00a0 abductors are prone\u00a0 to take advantage of the nighttime.\u00a0 The accused took this girl to Pasig about eight o'clock in the morning in\u00a0 an open <em>carromata<\/em>.\u00a0 According to the girl's own story, he\u00a0 took\u00a0 no\u00a0 in decent liberties with her in any way whatever. Is it safe for a court of justice to speculate\u00a0 on\u00a0 what the intentions of the defendant were on such a basis as the facts of this case\u00a0 present?\u00a0 On the one hand we have\u00a0 the practically uncorroborated testimony of the girl, Ana, which is inherently improbable in many\u00a0 important\u00a0 particulars.\u00a0\u00a0 Every point in her testimony which\u00a0 is essential\u00a0 to\u00a0 proving\u00a0 an immoral purpose on the part of the defendant is\u00a0 contradicted by apparently reliable and disinterested witnesses, and it\u00a0 is these\u00a0 very accusations of dishonorable conduct which are inherently improbable.\u00a0 By what rules for weighing evidence can the conclusion be reached that such a story is true, when it\u00a0 deviates so\u00a0 far from ordinary\u00a0 human conduct, and when it is opposed by a number of witnesses who gave sane and reasonable accounts\u00a0 of\u00a0 what they saw and did, which, when pieced together, produce a statement of facts which is consistent and\u00a0 in harmony\u00a0 with ordinary human\u00a0 conduct?<\/p><p>It\u00a0 is\u00a0 conceded that\u00a0 it is\u00a0 not necessary to prove sexual intercourse in order to obtain a conviction under article 446 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 The mere intent to seduce the girl is sufficient.\u00a0\u00a0 But it is submitted that in the absence of overt acts, very cogent proof is needed\u00a0 to establish a man's intentions.<\/p><p>Were there any overt acts on the part of the defendant in the case at bar which were inconsistent with honorable purpose?\u00a0 In\u00a0 the\u00a0 case\u00a0 decided by\u00a0 the supreme\u00a0 court\u00a0 of Spain on November 30,1875\u00a0 (cited in the majority opinion), the defendant took the girl to an inn and kept her there two days, during which time he\u00a0 had carnal relations with her. The court here had something\u00a0 more than mere intentions upon which to base its judgment of conviction.\u00a0 Tracing the acts of the defendant in the case at bar from the time\u00a0 he and the girl Ana entered the <em>carromata<\/em> until the policeman arrested the two in Pasig, is there anything in the outward\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 demeanor of the said defendant which can be called improper?\u00a0 In United States <em>vs<\/em>. Alvarez (1 Phil, Rep., 351), the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 had the abducted girl\u00a0 in\u00a0 his house for a period of ten days.\u00a0 The\u00a0 intimacy between the two\u00a0 had existed for several months notwithstanding that the defendant was already married.\u00a0 Here was another clear\u00a0 case in which the court was not obliged to rely upon the unexpressed intentions of the defendant.\u00a0 In United States <em>vs<\/em>. Meneses (14\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 151), the defendant induced\u00a0 the\u00a0 girl to accompany him in a earromata on the promise that he would take her before an\u00a0 officer and\u00a0 marry her.\u00a0 After riding around the streets of Manila for some time, he stated that it being Saturday afternoon he could get no one to perform the ceremony, and about\u00a0 9 o'clock that night took her to a room\u00a0 where he had sexual intercourse with her. Another clear case of overt acts, or rather fulfilled intentions.\u00a0 In United States <em>vs<\/em>. Padua\u00a0 (7 Phil. Rep., 399), the defendant took the girl from a town\u00a0 called Candon to a town called San Ildefonso, and on arrival at the Jatter place took her to the convent for the purpose of asking the parish priest\u00a0 to marry them.\u00a0 The court\u00a0 reversed the lower tribunal and set the defendant at liberty.\u00a0 It seems to me that the reasons back of this decision were (1) that the defendant committed\u00a0 no overt acts showing\u00a0 unchaste designs, and (2) the facts of the case did not sufficiently show that his intentions were unchaste in taking the girl away from home. In the United States <em>vs<\/em>. Ysip (6 Phil. Rep., 26), the defendant was a peddler.\u00a0\u00a0 On arriving at the town of Bacon, he made the acquaintance of the girl and obtained her consent as well as her mother's to a marriage, the record not disclosing why he\u00a0 did\u00a0 not ask for the consent of the girl's father.\u00a0 While the father was absent in a neighboring town, the girl, accompanied by her mother and two little brothers, started with the defendant for his native province with the intention of marrying him.\u00a0\u00a0 After\u00a0 being on the road two days, her father overtook the party\u00a0 and a charge of abduction\u00a0 was filed against the accused, which was sustained in the lower court.\u00a0\u00a0 This court\u00a0 set the defendant at liberty. The court said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"We think, however, that the premises do not justify the conclusion (of\u00a0 the trial court\u00a0 that in taking1 the girl to his native province without previously marrying her the presumption of improper motives\u00a0 was created), and we are confirmed in this opinion by the fact that the accused burdened himself in his flight with the impedimenta of a prospective mother-in-law and her two minor children, and also by the exemplary conduct of the young\u00a0 couple on\u00a0 their journey as far as they succeeded in making it, for it was conclusively proven that during their flight the\u00a0 girl never\u00a0 left her mother's side.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Here, again,\u00a0 there were no\u00a0 overt acts on the part of the defendant, and his avowed\u00a0 design of marrying the young lady was completely frustrated, leaving the court to\u00a0 speculate as\u00a0 freely\u00a0 upon what might have been his\u00a0 real intentions in\u00a0 the matter as in the case at bar.\u00a0 Yet the\u00a0 court did not consider the\u00a0 evidence sufficient to show unchaste designs.\u00a0 In all the cases\u00a0 I have\u00a0 had the opportunity of examining, wherein a conviction was obtained under article 446 of the Penal Code, there were sexual relations between the defendant and the abducted girl.\u00a0 On the other hand, in all those cases which have reached this court\u00a0 wherein the defendant had been sentenced in the lower court <em>for his intentions only,<\/em> the judgment was reversed.\u00a0 I believe it is therefore safe\u00a0 to assert that\u00a0 if there be any adjudicated case wherein the defendant has been convicted under article 446 solely on his intentions, there must have been potent facts which showed his manifest designs\u00a0 too strongly for any reasonable doubt.\u00a0\u00a0 It is not impossible, under this article, as stated above, to\u00a0 convict a defendant on his clearly expressed intentions.\u00a0\u00a0 Such a result would obtain if, for example, in the present case the defendant had been already married; or if he had\u00a0 taken\u00a0 any indecent liberties\u00a0 with her.\u00a0\u00a0 Such facts would have sufficiently shown his unchaste design.\u00a0\u00a0 But, as I have said, there were no overt acts on the part of the defendant in the case at bar, and the court must rely upon the intentions\u00a0 of the defendant as far as they can be ascertained from his conduct up to the time he was arrested by the policeman.\u00a0 Speaking of the defendant's\u00a0\u00a0 intentions, the\u00a0 court says:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Were it true that the sole\u00a0 intention of the accused in effecting the abduction, was\u00a0 thus\u00a0 to\u00a0 enable him\u00a0 to be married by a duly authorized authority or minister\u00a0 of the gospel, he could very well have\u00a0 found such in\u00a0 this city, where ministers of\u00a0 the different religious\u00a0 sects abound, without the need of taking the\u00a0 abducted girl to the pueblo of Pasig with the unlawful intent of placing her in a private house.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Here the court in effect attempts to outline the correct procedure for a couple who have eloped with the intention of getting married.\u00a0 If the couple do not go to the nearest minister or official competent to perform the ceremony, the would be husband may\u00a0 be\u00a0 convicted\u00a0 of\u00a0 abduction\u00a0 under article 446 of the\u00a0 Penal Code.\u00a0 The temptation to indulge in levity presents itself in considering any such restrictions upon the\u00a0 methods adopted by\u00a0 couples who elope for the purpose of getting married.\u00a0\u00a0 But\u00a0 in\u00a0 all seriousness, the liberty and innocence of a citizen\u00a0 is at stake.\u00a0 He is facing a term of nearly two years in the penitentiary..\u00a0 In the\u00a0 case of United States <em>vs<\/em>. Ysip\u00a0 (<em>supra<\/em>), the couple were going from one province into another, requiring a trip of several days.\u00a0 Yet this court rejected the idea that the defendant in that case had unchaste designs because he did not marry the young lady in\u00a0 her own town.\u00a0 Also,\u00a0 in\u00a0 the case of the United States <em>vs<\/em>. Padua\u00a0 (<em>supra<\/em>), it was doubtless unnecessary for the defendant to take his loved one to another town to have the marriage ceremony\u00a0 performed.\u00a0\u00a0 It appears\u00a0 that the persons concerned in these two cases had sacrificed\u00a0 convenience for the sake of 8ome other unascertained purpose in connection with their desire to get married.\u00a0 Parties frequently travel\u00a0 a long way to have the marriage\u00a0 ceremony performed by a particular personage, in a particular place, or for some other particular reason.\u00a0 This court is going far into the realm of uncertain speculation in attributing improper motives to the defendant in the case at bar because he took his bride-to-be to Pasig to have the ceremony performed instead of having it done in Manila.\u00a0 In reference to taking the girl to the house where he supposed his aunt lived instead of taking her to the justice of the peace court, the\u00a0 court\u00a0 draws another inference\u00a0 of unchaste designs, saying: <\/p><p>\"The unchaste designs, which the accused undoubtedly had,\u00a0 were\u00a0 not manifested\u00a0 on account of\u00a0 the opportune intervention of a policeman\u00a0 as a result of\u00a0 a notice given him by a neighbor who saw the offended party crying and refusing to enter the said house in Pasig in which, had she done so, she would without doubt have been the victim of an unchaste attempt.\"<\/p><p>Yet the only testimony in the record on the point is that of the woman of that house, who states that she refused entrance to the\u00a0 two.\u00a0 It\u00a0 further appears\u00a0 that defendant's aunt was not there, and that the woman of the house did not know either the defendant or the girl Ana.\u00a0\u00a0 Is it possible that the defendant, with the immoral purpose attributed to him by the court, would have taken the girl to a house where he was\u00a0 not known?\u00a0 To my mind, such a purpose calls for connivance and conspiracy on the part of the owner\u00a0 of the house.\u00a0 There is not that certainty of acquiescence on the part of an unknown person in such an immoral purpose as would induce an abductor to apply for the use of his house to aid in its fulfilment.\u00a0 I think the court Ijere goes further into the realm of speculation\u00a0 as to what the defendant's intentions were.\u00a0 It is also admitted that the girl was crying when the policeman arrived\u00a0 and that she then and\u00a0 thereafter madestatements-inconsistent with any desire to marry the defendant,\u00a0 If judicial notice may be taken of so tender a subject,\u00a0 it may be\u00a0 said that it is not uncommon to see adult women of the best families crying\u00a0 just previous to the marriage ceremony, when they are surrounded by their\u00a0\u00a0 relatives and friends\u00a0 and everything is being done in the most orthodox\u00a0 fashion.\u00a0 It may even\u00a0 be insinuated that there have been\u00a0 instances of the\u00a0 bride-to-be refusing to fulfil her part of the contract at the last moment.\u00a0\u00a0 How much more, then, may we expect to see this young girl, 14 years of age, poor and unediicated, who had left her home under such circumstances, adopting such tactics?<\/p><p>Viewing the\u00a0 abortive\u00a0 attempt of the defendant in the light of the evidence adduced, it is clear that whatever his plans were, he\u00a0 failed to\u00a0 carry any of them to completion except that of getting the girl, Ana, to the town of Pasig. The recorded account of that journey is such that the defendant could have proceeded in an\u00a0 honorable manner to the fulfilment of his stated design of marrying the girl had not the guardians of the peace prevented him from doing so. It is elementary when a\u00a0 special\u00a0 intent is required to make an act an\u00a0 offense, that the doing of the act does not\u00a0 raise a presumption\u00a0 that it was done with\u00a0 the specific intent.

Having obtained his freedom he entered upon a career which, from about the year 1902 until the 24th of July, 1910, when he was again captured, made his name a fear and  a dread among the  peaceful inhabitants  of an  extensive territory. The band, of which he was the head, wrought havoc among the peaceful pueblos of the provinces named for more than seven years.  In June, 1902, this band, composed of from two to three hundred people,  at least partly armed, attacked the barrio  of  Santa Rita, pueblo of  Cabiao, Province of Nueva Ecija, shouting as their battle cry \"Viva Santa Iglesia.\"  In this  assault they  captured five residents of the pueblo and carried them  away as prisoners.  On the 19th of June, 1903, this same band attacked the pueblo  of San Juan de Guimba, Province of Nueva Ecija, taking from the local police their arms and ammunition.   In the same month and year the same band, composed of about fifty persons, most of them armed with guns or revolvers, having disguised themselves  as  Constabulary  and  announcing themselves as such,  raided the pueblo of Jaen, Nueva Ecija.  They attacked the principal municipal building, stole several guns and revolvers, with ammunition, and captured the municipal president, a person named Apolinario Gimenez, and  three municipal policemen.  On the 2d day of July, 1903, ten members of the Philippine  Constabulary located in the barrio of San Miguel, pueblo  of Concepcidn, Province of Tarlac, were poisoned by members of this band, by direct order of the accused, for the purpose of obtaining the arms and ammunition which  they  carried.  During the  same month the said band, composed of about one hundred persons, armed with revolvers and bolos,  entered the pueblo of Mabalacat, Province of Pampanga, and assaulted the Constabulary quarters  in said town, crying \"Viva Santa Iglesia,\" capturing six Springfield rifles, three guns, six revolvers, with ammunition, and three pair of shoes belonging to the soldiers.  In this  attack they killed a Constabulary soldier called Anacleto Galang and captured another named Benito Galang.  On the 1st day of  February, 1903, this band, composed of about two hundred men, armed  with bolos, daggers, and clubs entered the pueblo of San  Jose, Nueva Ecija, and assaulted the quarters of the Constabulary, stealing nine guns, with cartridges and ammunition, and wounding two of the Constabulary.   On the 15th of September, 1908, the same band,  composed of about three hundred persons, armed  with thirty guns, a second time assaulted  the  pueblo of San Jose,  Nueva Ecija, with the battle-cry of \"Viva Felipe Salvador,\" attacked the  Constabulary quarters, killed a Constabulary soldier, and  stole two guns and some accouterments.   This action  was directed by Felipe Salvador, who, not desiring to expose himself personally to the danger involved in the attack, remained at Malapad na Bato near by.   In September, 1903, the band, at that time containing about one hundred and fifty .men, armed with bolos and clubs, raided the barrio of San Vicente, Province of Nueva Ecija, and captured about one hundred persons, including women  and children.  In the month of January or February of the year 1906 the accused, Felipe  Salvador,  as chief of the  said band  of brigands known as \"Santa Iglesia,\" issued a circular  letter calling on the people of Hagonoy and Calunapit in the Province of Bulacan to assemble at  Mount Arayat for the purpose of attacking the Constabulary quarters at Malolos, capital of the Province of  Bulacan.  Many  of the residents of these places complied  with the order  and made their  way to Mount Arayat, where they were met by the  accused.  As a result of this gathering a new band was formed  bearing the same name.  On the night of the 15th of April, 1906, armed with guns, revolvers, daggers, and bolos, they entered the pueblo of Malolos aforesaid, crying \"Viva Felipe Salvador\u2014Viva Santa Iglesia\u2014Viva Apong Ipi,\" and assaulted the Constabulary quarters, killing three Constabulary privates  and wounding four others,  stealing  twenty  guns, seventeen belts, each one containing fifty cartridges.  They captured  Juan Palomo,  who  was  held  as  a prisoner on Mount Sinucuan  or  Mount Arayat nearly six weeks.  On the 9th day of July, 1906, this same band, composed of about fifty-three persons, armed with thirty-seven guns and other arms, and following the  orders of the accused in this case, fought a battle  with a company of Constabulary soldiers in  'the pueblo of Hagonoy,  Bulacan,  in  which one Constabulary soldier was killed and four members of the attacking band met their death.  In the month of March,  1910, this band of outlaws, led personally by the accused, Felipe Salvador, assembled to the number of about three hundred persons at Mount Arayat,  Province of Pampanga,  for the purpose of raiding the pueblo of Santa Ana and of assaulting and capturing the quarters of the Constabulary  at said place.  This  purpose was  not accomplished,  however,  by reason of the action of the authorities, which prevented its success.  Notwithstanding this fact, however, in the month of April, the band, armed, and directed personally  by the accused, entered the pueblo of Arayat, in the Province of Pampanga, and there on the following night fought a battle with the Constabulary in which one of the band was killed.<\/p>\n<p>This is in synthesis the history of the operations  of this notorious band and its still more notorious leader.  During        the seven or eight years  to  which we have referred the Government was almost continually sending out expeditions for the destruction or capture of the band.   During this time the Government apprehended and punished more than a score of its' members.  The sums of money paid out by the Government in expeditions senj out against said  band, together with the  value of the property which said band captured and destroyed during its operations, amounted probably to nearly  one million pesos.<\/p>\n<p>The  accused,  in  his  testimony  upon the trial, admitted having been the founder and the supreme chief of the band known  as  \"Santa  Iglesia;\"  that it  had been organized through his efforts  during the revolution against Spain and had continued until the time of his capture.  He asserted, however, that such  band was not a band of brigands or desperadoes but was  composed  of law-abiding  citizens, and that the sole end and purpose of the organization was to \"pray to God for mercy.\"   In  the face of the overwhelming proofs in this case, such assertion does not even reach the dignity of an excuse.  The object and purpose of an organization  are best  demonstrated by its  acts or its results. It matters not what may be its constitution or  what may be the objects set down on paper.  If such organization dedicates itself to pillage and murder,  to nightly attacks on unoffending  citizens, to the destruction of homes and of property, to the capture of innocent men and women, it is a band of robbers and murderers, no matter what may be its objects as set down on paper or those proclaimed by its leader.  All these things this band did; and while it was doing them the  accused was  their chief, maintaining the organization by his  force of character,  using his genius for leadership to'make  it effective, and sending it forth under the cover of night with instructions to attack and kill.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the  accused  rests the argument which he presents upon two bases.  The first one is that the accused was not personally  present  at the time when  the raids of this band took place and, therefore, should not be held responsible for them  and the acts committed in the course           thereof.  The second is that, even if the accused were personally present, the penalty which he should suffer should be imposed under Act  No.  2036 of the Philippine Legislature, lately enacted, which deals with the crime of <em>bandolerismo<\/em>  and notably modifies the severity of the penalties prescribed  by the Act which was in force at the time of the commission of the  crimes alleged.<\/p>\n<p>As to the first point little need be said.  It is of no consequence,  legally speaking, whether or not Felipe Salvador was  present  during  the raids of his band.   If they were under his  leadership,  if  they   did  the things  which  he commanded, if he planned  their campaigns of pillage and violence,  and gave the orders  which they executed it is immaterial  whether he  was personally  present or not.<\/p>\n<p>That.the defendant was at Mount Arayat while his band was  at Malolos is not  a controlling factor under  all  the circumstances of  this case.   Although  absent from many of the raids, including this one, nevertheless his genius had obtained  the men, had  organized them,  had laid the plans and directed the attacks.  Although miles away, his spirit and personality animated his men and were incarnated in the battle cry of \"Viva Felipe Salvador, \" \"Viva Apong Ipi.\" Although absent,  their  faith in him filled them with an exultant courage; for was he not to them always, \"Felipe, Salvador del Mundo?\"<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, should ignorance and superstition be punished when the intelligence and ability which  take advantage of them go free?  Is not the one whose ambition, intelligence, and genius  welds  into a weapon of offense the ignorance, prejudice; religious fervor and, mayhap, patriotic sentiment of others and hurls it into the midst of peaceful communities  with the  injunction to  destroy and  kill, fully as guilty as they whose   sentiments and  passions he  has aroused to attain his sinister purposes?   Is he whose ambitions, intelligence,  and  genius have worked upon the untrained faculties of others less responsible for the results than  the poor, deceived,  and  overwrought men upon whom liis genius  has  imposed?  But  for the baneful influence   of the accused at bar, but for his gift for organization, his genius for command, and an ambition which hesitated at no scruple, halted at no deed, and which drove everything before it, the members of his band, many of whom are now convicts  or outlaws,  would have followed the vocations of peace,  much valuable property would have been saved, and the years during which he operated would have  been, for many,  years of security and plenty instead of fear and want. We  do not believe  that the ignorant victims should be punished, while the one whose skill and cunning victimized them goes free.<\/p>\n<p>As to  the second  point.   The  attorney for the accused asserts the proposition, under proper conditions well recognized in  Spanish law,  that a subsequent law punishing a crime less severely than a law previously enacted shall have retroactive effect and the penalty imposed for  crime, even though committed prior to the passage of the latter, shall be governed by the terms of the milder Act.  He, therefore, contends that Act No. 2036 of the Philippine Legislature, although a later Act,  should apply to this case.   In this contention counsel forgets that portion of the Act in question which  relates to the  condition which is  presented when, at the time  the crime of bcmdolerismp is committed,  there are committed other crimes of a graver and higher nature.   In other words, he failed to take into consideration that portion which provides that,  if during the commission of the crime of <em>bandolerismo <\/em> the band should also commit the crime of murder,  for example, the members of the band, although at the  time engaged in the crime of <em>bandolerismo<\/em>, might also be prosecuted for the  crime of murder.  In the case at bar several murders were committed by this band  and there were several  robberies with homicide.  We have already held in the case of U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> De Guzman  (19 Phil., Rep., 350)  that where the information contains facts sufficient to constitute the crime of murder or the crime of robbery with homicide, the accused may be convicted of such crime even though the caption  of the information charges <em>bandolerismo<\/em>.   In  that case we said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The facts alleged in the information fully, clearly and distinctly charge  the  crime of robbery with homicide,  as defined and penalized in article 502, paragraph 1,  of the Penal Code, as well as  the  crime  of <em>bandolerismo<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">*       *       *       * * * * <\/p>\n<p>\"The crime of <em>bandolerismo<\/em>, as set out in the above information,  includes the crime of robbery with homicide. We have repeatedly held that  an accused may, the  proofs warranting it, be convicted of  any crime described  and charged by  the facts set out in  the information  irrespective of  the  characterization  of  the crime made by  the prosecuting officer.  The situation of the  accused  would not be  improved  by a conviction  of robbery with homicide rather than <em>bandolerismo<\/em>.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It is alleged in the information in this case  that  said band, under the immediate  orders  and directions of the accused in this case, \"on the night of  the 15th of  April, 1906, entered the municipality of Malolos, Bulacan, attacked the quarters of the Constabulary at that place and killed three of its guards, wounded various soldiers,  captured a musician, Juan Palomo,  and stole twenty-three guns,  two revolvers, one thousand cartridges and a musical instrument, the property of said Constabulary and of the Insular Goverment.\"  The facts alleged in  this information  were fully supported by the evidence  in  the  case.  Together they demonstrate beyond question or doubt that the accused and his band  are  guilty of the murder of the three soldiers referred to.   This fact makes it  unnecessary to determine the question presented by counsel for the reason  that that Act provides for the very case  in hand.<\/p>\n<p><em> The judgment of the court below  is founded in the facts and  is supported by the law and must be and is hereby affirmed, without special  finding as to costs.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano,  C, J,, Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and  <em>Trent,  JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>",

DIONISIO BARROGA ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This appeal was taken by the five defendants, from the judgment of conviction rendered in this cause by the Honorable Judge Dionisio Chanco.<br\/><br\/>Between 7 and 8 o'clock of the evening of March 27, 1910, four men assaulted the house of the spouses Basilio Longino and Leona Fontano, situate in the pueblo of Vigan, the capital of the Province of Ilocos Sur, when the owners of the house were absent and the only occupants thereof were Ruperta Longino, a girl 13 years of age, a daughter of the said couple, and her grandmother, Benita Manuel, who was in the kitchen. On appearing at the house, the robbers asked for some water to drink and when Ruperta gave it to them, one of the men threw it into the fireplace and the others immediately put out the light. As the grandmother Benita Manuel reprehended them for their conduct, they ill-treated her and some of them struck her with a stick while the others choked the girl and blindfolded her. The said men then seized a trunk belonging to Leona Fontano; it was locked and its owner had the key. They carried the trunk outside, where it was afterwards found, on the same night of the robbery, in a vegetable garden at a place east of the said house. It had been broken open and P42 in cash, jewelry and wearing apparel worth about a hundred pesos, were missing. As a result of the ill-treatment to which the old lady, Benita Manuel, was subjected, her left forearm was broken, her chest was bruised and her head swollen. She testified that she was ill for more than a month and was unable to work for thirty days.<br\/><br\/>Subsequently a complaint was filed in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur, charging the said five defendants with the crime of <i>robo en cuadrilla<\/i>, and the court, in view of the evidence adduced, sentenced each of the accused to the penalty of eight years and one day of <i>presidio mayor<\/i>, to the accessory penalties, to pay an indemnity of three pesos to Benita Manuel, to restore the articles recovered, or to pay the value of the property not recovered, and to pay the costs. From that judgment the defendants appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>The facts related, fully proved in this case, show the crime to be that of robbery, provided for and penalized in articles 502 and 503, No. 5, of the Penal Code, inasmuch as in the evening of March 27, 1910, five individuals assaulted the house of Basilio Longino and Leona Fontano, during their absence, and, after having maltreated their daughter, Ruperta Longino, and said Ruperta's grandmother, Benita Manuel, seized and carried away a trunk belonging to the said couple, which was afterwards found broken open, at a place some distance from the house and in a vegetable garden, and from which were missing P42 in cash, some jewelry and wearing apparel, the latter valued altogether at about P100.<br\/><br\/>The criminal act should not be classified as robbery <i>en cuadrilla<\/i>, for the reason that the record does not show that the four persons who committed the crime were all armed; one of them, only, was seen to carry a stick, and article 505 of the code requires that four or more armed persons unite in the robbery. Neither may the crime be held to be comprised within paragraph 4 of the said article 503, for the injury inflicted upon Benita Manuel can only be classified as <i>menos grave<\/i>; the physician who attended her from the beginning so classified the wounds and testified that after he had set the fractured bone and had treated her two or three times, she returned home and he did not see her again, though he believed that she could not have engaged in her habitual labors during a period of thirty days. Therefore these wounds must be classified simply as <i>lesiones menos graves<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the denial of the defendants Lucas Villaros, Proceso Ramos and Dionisio Barroga, and that these defendants pleaded not guilty, yet withal the case furnishes decisive and conclusive evidence of their guilt as principals, by direct participation, in the crime of robbery under prosecution. The record shows that Lucas Villaros and Proceso Ramos, while inside the assaulted house, were identified by the girl Ruperta Longino, though Benita Manuel did not succeed in recognizing any of them, for the reason, she said, that on account of old age her sight was very poor. Besides this identification, the said two defendants, Villaros and Ramos, while they were held under arrest as alleged principals in the robbery in question, of their own free will and accord confessed, before the municipal president of the pueblo, Jose Villanueva, and the chief of police, Alejandro Quirolgico, their participation in the said crime, as testified by these latter; and counsel for these defendants did not prove that the confessions, made before the officials mentioned, were obtained by any maltreatment or intimidation on the part of the policeman Jose Parel; the defendant Ramos did not deny nor disprove the testimony of the aforementioned municipal president and chief of police concerning the confessions; it was not shown that Villaros received the slightest injury in consequence of any maltreatment such as the defense alleged was inflicted upon him by the policeman Jose Parel, who denied that he ill-treated this defendant; and, in view of the fact that these defendants neither complained of such maltreatment to the chief of police or to the municipal president, before whom they made the confessions aforementioned, nor reported the same to the justice of the peace during the preliminary investigation in the case, it is concluded that these defendants did confess to the municipal president and the chief of police of the <i>pueblo<\/i> that they took part in the robbery in question, and that they so confessed voluntarily, there being no coercion, violence, or maltreatment employed, as they afterwards maliciously alleged for the sole purpose of destroying the evidence of the prosecution and saving themselves from conviction. And if to these facts it be added that certain wearing apparel, which was identified by the offended party as being among the articles robbed from the said trunk, was found in the possession of Lucas Villaros, considering the other evidence of the prosecution of record, the mind is convinced of the guilt of the said defendants, Lucas Villaros and Proceso Ramos, as principals in the robbery under prosecution.<br\/><br\/>With respect to Dionisio Barroga, the evidence shows that he also confessed before the municipal president, Jose Villanueva, and the chief of police, Alejandro Quirolgico, to being one of the malefactors who committed the said robbery and that he had in his possession some of the jewelry; these facts were corroborated by the said president and chief of police, who both testified that Barroga confessed the crime of his own free will and that some jewelry was found in his possession which was afterwards identified by the offended party, Leona Fontano, as belonging to her and being a part of the jewelry taken from her trunk which had been broken open by the robbers.<br\/><br\/>This defendant's counsel alleged that his client confessed to having taken part in the crime because the said chief of police maltreated and threatened him; but, in the investigation made in this matter, Barroga testified that he had not suffered any injury or bodily harm whatever, which would be incredible were it true that he had been maltreated as he stated. Moreover, on making the said confession before the municipal president, and afterwards in testifying before the justice of the peace, he made no complaint of such maltreatment nor did he report the violence to which he had been subjected for the purpose of compelling him to confess his participation in the crime, were it true that any violence was exercised upon him.<br\/><br\/>As regards Barroga's allegation that the jewelry found in his possession belonged to his wife Estefania Manzano, notwithstanding that it was identified as being a part of that taken from the offended party Fontano, the record shows that the defendant's wife denied that a certain ring was hers and she also stated that she doubted whether a pair of earrings belonged to her, both of which were among the articles seized in her house. All this furnishes conclusive proof of the guilt of this defendant as a principal in the said crime, not only by his confession made before the municipal president and the chief of police, but also by the seizure in his possession of some of the jewelry stolen.<br\/><br\/>Against the other defendants, Pedro Alisias and Lucas Barroga, the record does not contain sufficient evidence, even circumstantial, to show that they participated in the robbery.<br\/><br\/>Pedro Alisias was arrested because he was under suspicion and was living in the neighborhood of the house robbed, and though, according to the policeman Jose Parel, Alisias confessed the crime to him and said that he had hidden in a sugar-cane field the three pesos that were his share, and told him that his companions were Siso Ramos, Dionisio Barroga and one named Lucas, yet the said Alisias testified that he was led to confess and implicate the parties mentioned by the said policeman, and that the P3 which he pretended to have recovered from the sugar-cane land as being a part of the stolen property, were his own and came from his pocket. If this defendant had taken part in the crime, he would have been identified by the offended parties, especially by the girl Ruperta Longino, who identified two of the malefactors, since Pedro Alisias lived in a house near that in which the crime was perpetrated, frequented the latter and, according to this girl, is a cousin of her mother; this witness, therefore, would have seen him, had he been among the robbers in the house.<br\/><br\/>The only evidence implicating Lucas Barroga is the testimony of the municipal president, who stated that this defendant, when arrested, confessed to him that he had taken part in the commission of the crime, and although the threats which Barroga averred had been made to him were not proved, yet the record does not show that any of the stolen articles were found in his possession, nor that he was recognized as one of the robbers.<br\/><br\/>A defendant in a criminal action shall be presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved, and, in case of a reasonable doubt that his guilt is satisfactorily shown, he shall be entitled to an acquittal. (Sec. 57, General Orders, No. 58.)<br\/><br\/>In accordance with this legal principle, the two defendants last mentioned, Lucas Barroga arid Pedro Alisias, should be acquitted, since the record does not disclose conclusive and satisfactory proof that they took part in the robbery in question, and even were their innocence doubtful, no legal reason exists for their conviction and they must be acquitted.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the robbery in question, account must be taken of the attendance of the aggravating circumstances of its having been perpetrated at night and in the dwelling of the offended parties, with no extenuating circumstances to offset the same; therefore, the penalty must be imposed upon the convicted principals in the maximum degree of that specified in paragraph 5 of the aforesaid article 503 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the first of the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from, it was not proven at trial that the confessions made before the local authorities by the three convicted defendants were obtained through intimidation, violence, threats or promises, and therefore it is held that they were freely and voluntarily made and must be accepted as proof of the crime charged and of the guilt of its perpetrators. (Sec. 4, Act No. 619.)<br\/><br\/>The act of displaying before an offended party, for his identification, articles seized in the possession of the alleged perpetrators of a robbery or theft, is lawful and is not prohibited by the law of procedure, and questions leading to the identification of the said articles may be asked such offended party; therefore the trial court, in proceeding in the manner stated, did not err.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, and concluding that thereby the other errors assigned to the judgment appealed from are refuted, we hereby sentence the defendants Proceso Ramos, Lucas Villaros and Dionisio Barroga to the penalty of eight years and one day of <i>presidio mayor<\/i>, to the accessory penalties, to restore the unrecovered articles robbed or to pay their value, jointly and severally, in the sum of P42 and also to pay, jointly and severally, the sum of P7.50 as indemnity, to the injured party Benita Manuel, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, in view of the nature of the penalty; they shall also each of them pay one-third of the costs of both instances. The other defendants, Pedro Alisias and Lucas Barroga, are acquitted, with their share of the costs <i>de oficio<\/i>. The judgment appealed from is thus affirmed, in so far as it is consistent with this decision, and in so far as it is not, it is reversed. The defendants Pedro Alisias and Lucas Barroga shall immediately be set at liberty by an order of release addressed to the Director of Prisons, should they not be held for any other cause.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

They\u00a0 well knew that, without to prepare, a trial was\u00a0\u00a0 a mockery and a farce.\u00a0 They were fully informer that if they left that question to\u00a0 the discretion of the court, the trial would be\u00a0 rather\u00a0 a matter of favor than\u00a0 of right.\u00a0\u00a0 It has never been t policy of constitutions or of statutes to permit the inalienable right of be left to the discretion of any man.\u00a0 The makers\u00a0 of\u00a0 laws and of constitutions clearly foresaw the unbearable conditions which would ultimatum prevail if the right\u00a0 to a\u00a0 hearing should depend upon the discretion of judge\u00a0 or of the court.\u00a0\u00a0 The precedent\u00a0 sent out from this court that, u the Code of Criminal Procedure of these Islands, the right to prepare for depended upon the discretion of the court, would disrupt established practice would leave every person charged with crime in doubt as to\u00a0 rights of which no one\u00a0 can constitutionally deprive him.\u00a0 It is true\u00a0 that the trial\u00a0 co these Islands,\u00a0 following their usual custom of protecting the rights of persons before them, would use that discretion\u00a0 with care and would\u00a0 never intentionally deprive any person of those privileges necessary to his com defense.\u00a0 But that is\u00a0 not\u00a0 quite the point.\u00a0\u00a0 The danger\u00a0 lies in this, the court should, in the exercise of that\u00a0 discretion, deprive the defend a hearing, his only remedy would be by appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 He would not be\u00a0 able to take advantage of that quick and speedy remedy by habeas corpus which is the refuge of every\u00a0 man who\u00a0 is\u00a0 denied\u00a0 the\u00a0 right of\u00a0 hearing.\u00a0\u00a0 He would be\u00a0 relegated to that slower and more tedious\u00a0 process of appeal, with the corresponding loss of freedom.<\/p><p>There is\u00a0 no\u00a0 procedure known to the Philippine Islands wherein a defendant refused time to prepare for trial. There is no practice by which he is deprived of it.\u00a0 There is no law\u00a0 under which he\u00a0 can\u00a0 be\u00a0 denied it On the contrary, the only procedure known to us\u00a0 is one embodied in the\u00a0 imperative law wherein\u00a0 the accused is\u00a0 expressly given two days in\u00a0 which to prepare for trial.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 only practice known\u00a0 is that which grants\u00a0 him\u00a0 the time referred to.\u00a0\u00a0 But the recognized practice and\u00a0 procedure of a country is due process of law\u00a0 of that country.\u00a0 It is because of that fact that the relative\u00a0 to time in which to prepare for trial was made specific and imperative. Under that law no court has discretion.\u00a0 It cannot exercise judgment It cannot\u00a0 interpret or construe. It\u00a0 can only obey.\u00a0 To obey that law only way of giving the defendant a trial.\u00a0 His rights\u00a0 are not\u00a0 satisfied the exercise of a discretion upon the\u00a0 question;\u00a0 he is entitled to the t<\/p><p>We are well aware that, if the court had been given the power to\u00a0 determine, upon facts, whether the time in question should be granted or\u00a0 not, that the court had been given discretion in the matter, a very different quest would have been presented.\u00a0 In such case due process of\u00a0 law would\u00a0 have been conserved\u00a0 whichever way\u00a0 the judgment of the court might have gone; for,\u00a0 in that event, the requirements of due process of law would have be satisfied with a decision either\u00a0 way.\u00a0 Due process of law includes a decision either way in a\u00a0 case where discretion is lodged with the court.<\/p><p>While there is no case at\u00a0 hand\u00a0 precisely in point, there are many\u00a0 anal It was held in the case of\u00a0 Callan <em> vs.<\/em>\u00a0 Wilson (127 U. ,S.,\u00a0 540) trial of a defendant without a jury violates the\u00a0 due\u00a0 process clause of Constitution of the\u00a0 United States,\u00a0 and,\u00a0 if\u00a0 convicted,\u00a0 he\u00a0 is entitle the\u00a0 benefit of the writ\u00a0 of habeas corpus.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that is just as much\u00a0 a failure of due process of law to\u00a0 deprive\u00a0 a\u00a0 defendant an opportunity\u00a0 to\u00a0 prepare for a trial as it is to\u00a0 deprive him of the r to be tried before a jury.\u00a0 To deprive one wholly of time to prepare for is\u00a0 to\u00a0 deny him a trial altogether as that trial is defined by the law o land.<\/p><p>In the case of Windsor <em>vs.<\/em>\u00a0 McVeigh\u00a0 (93\u00a0 U.\u00a0 S.,\u00a0 274), which was action for condemnation based\u00a0 on an alleged forfeiture, a summons\u00a0 was issued\u00a0 for the defendant and he was brought\u00a0 into\u00a0 court; but\u00a0 the appearance of the owner, when made, was stricken out and his right to appear was denied.\u00a0\u00a0 In that case the court said, quoting Mr. Justice Swayne in 11 Wall, 267:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"The order in effect denied the respondent a hearing.\u00a0 It is alleged\u00a0 he in the position\u00a0 of an alien enemy,\u00a0 and could have no <em>locus standi<\/em>\u00a0 that forum.\u00a0\u00a0 If assailed there, he could defend there.\u00a0 The liability\u00a0 a are inseparable.\u00a0\u00a0 A different result would be\u00a0 a blot upon\u00a0 our jurisprudence and\u00a0 civilization.\u00a0\u00a0 We cannot\u00a0 hesitate\u00a0 or doubt\u00a0 on the subject.\u00a0\u00a0 It be contrary to the first principles\u00a0 of\u00a0 the social compact, and of the right administration of justice.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Continuing the court said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"Wherever one is assailed in his person or his property, there he may def for the liability\u00a0 and the right\u00a0 are inseparable.\u00a0\u00a0 This is a principle justice, recognized as such by the common intelligence and\u00a0 conscience of nations.\u00a0 A sentence of a court pronounced against a party <em>without hearing him, or giving him an opportunity to be heard,<\/em> is not a judicial determination of his rights, and is not entitled to respect in any other\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"That there must\u00a0 be notice to a party of some kind, actual or constructive to a\u00a0 valid judgment affecting his rights, is admitted.\u00a0 Until notice\u00a0 is the court\u00a0 has no jurisdiction in any case to proceed to\u00a0 judgment,\u00a0 what its authority may be, by the\u00a0 law of its organization, over the subject m But notice is only for the purpose of affording the party an <em>opportunity being\u00a0 heard<\/em> upon the claim or the\u00a0 charges made; it is a summons to to appear and speak,\u00a0 if he has\u00a0 anything to say, why the judgment sought\u00a0 should not\u00a0 be rendered.\u00a0 A\u00a0 denial to a party, of the benefit of notice would be in effect to deny that\u00a0 he is entitled to notice at all, the\u00a0 sham and deceptive proceeding had better be omitted altogether.

the assurance he demands his trial, \"You shall, not have an opportunity\u00a0 to pr for trial or to produce your witnesses.\"\u00a0 It goes without\u00a0 saying that the right to a trial without any opportunity to prepare for it is an idle, a fatuous thing.<br\/><\/p><p>The argument for the motion, however, does not\u00a0 discuss this\u00a0 question. follows substantially the\u00a0 lines\u00a0 of\u00a0 the dissenting opinion filed in the o and makes substantially the same points against the prevailing decision. the argument of counsel on the motion and that found in the dissenting opinion lose sight, in our\u00a0 opinion, of the real ground upon which the court based decision.\u00a0 That being the case,\u00a0 the arguments, from one point of view, are necessity beside the point.<\/p><p>The argument of counsel on the motion,\u00a0 as well as that contained in\u00a0 the dissenting opinion, seizes upon the fact of the initial jurisdiction of the First Instance, that is, the jurisdiction of the court over the person of t defendant and the subject matter of the action at the beginning of the tr and makes it decisive of\u00a0 the case at bar.\u00a0 Indeed, the contention is made where a court has once acquired jurisdiction of the person of the defendant and of the subject matter of the motion, habeas corpus can never issue.\u00a0 Says the dissenting opinion: , \"Where an inferior court has jurisdiction of the the person in a criminal suit, and no writ of error lies in this court, it habeas corpus, review\u00a0 the legality of the proceedings.\"<\/p><p>Says the brief of counsel on the motion:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p>\"One authority\u00a0 after another was quoted in the original argument in this case to show that the commission of error by a\u00a0 court of final and exclusive jurisdiction\u00a0 cannot be reviewed\u00a0 or corrected in habeas corpus proceeding\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"The true principle of law is\u00a0 that errors committed by a trial\u00a0 court h final appellate jurisdiction\u00a0 of a criminal case\u00a0 do\u00a0 not\u00a0 deprive the could jurisdiction, and habeas corpus\u00a0 will not lie to review\u00a0 or correct the ac such court.\u00a0 <\/p><p>\"It is only upon the theory that the Court of First Instance had no\u00a0 jur over the defendant in the trial of said case,\u00a0 or over the subject matter case, that this court could have granted the writ of habeas corpus.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The whole burden of these arguments is\u00a0 that the Court of First Instance jurisdiction over the person of the defendant\u00a0 and the subject matter of t action when the trial\u00a0 began.\u00a0\u00a0 No attempt whatever is\u00a0 made\u00a0 to determine whether the court had jurisdiction at the close.\u00a0 That, which is the very the whole\u00a0 case,\u00a0 is\u00a0 taken entirely for granted.\u00a0 No discussion has\u00a0 been presented\u00a0 or argument made as to whether or not the court had authority t enter the judgment which it did enter or to enforce it after it was entered in so\u00a0 far as the initial jurisdiction may be considered as such authority attempt is made to determine whether the defendant\u00a0 was deprived of a constitutional right, or what effect such deprivation, if any,\u00a0 has upon t The fact of the original\u00a0 jurisdiction is seized\u00a0 upon as the only point in the case worthy of consideration and upon it are based all of the contentions made against the original decision.<\/p><p>Nobody\u00a0 has denied the initial jurisdiction of the trial court.\u00a0 It\u00a0 has been discussed or even\u00a0 questioned in this court.\u00a0 That jurisdiction has always been freely conceded.\u00a0 The decision\u00a0 of this court rested\u00a0 upon\u00a0 something which occurred\u00a0 after the\u00a0 jurisdiction referred to had attached and after trial had begun.\u00a0 It rested upon the proposition that, while the trial court jurisdiction in the first place,\u00a0 it either lost that jurisdiction during t the trial, or so transcended its powers as to\u00a0 render its judgment void.\u00a0 B a person had a peso in\u00a0 his pocket last week the\u00a0 conclusion does not necessarily follow that he has\u00a0 that peso in his pocket this\u00a0 week.\u00a0 Likewise fact that the trial court had jurisdiction at the time the trial began does necessitate the conclusion that it\u00a0 had jurisdiction when\u00a0 the trial\u00a0 court that it had authority or power to enter a particular judgment or to enforce after it was entered.\u00a0 There are many ways in which a court may lose jurisdiction between the beginning of\u00a0 the trial and the close thereof; and there are ma instances in\u00a0 the books where a court has, by its own acts, deprived the re of all legal efficacy\u00a0 and its judgment based thereon of all legal virtue.<\/p><p>This is what occurred in the case at bar.\u00a0 Having been brought before the bar of the court the defendant was driven to trial upon the moment in disregard of his demand for two days to prepare\u00a0 for trial made under section 30 of General Orders, No. 58, which provides that \"after his plea the defendant shall\u00a0 be entitled, on demand, to at least two days in which to prepare for trial.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The denial of the right to prepare for trial and the consequence forcing of the defendant to his defense without any time whatever for preparation is, under the provisions of our law, equivalent, in our judgment the refusal of a legal hearing.\u00a0 It amounts, in effect, to a complete denial trial.\u00a0 It was an abrogation of that due process of law which is the embodied procedure of the land, and without which a defendant has, in law, no trial all.<\/p><p>We stated in our former decision that habeas corpus would lie in certain where constitutional rights were denied to the defendant, even though the had jurisdiction at the beginning of the cause, or jurisdiction even to decide very question the decision of which destroyed completely the power of the court to enter a judgment of conviction or to enforce it, if

FRANCISCO CALLAPAG, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">In this case Juan Queja, Lino Barbaran, Eduardo Casta\u00f1eda, Melecio Antonio, and Francisco Callapag were charged by the fiscal of Isabela Province with having assassinated one Geronimo Canmayo.<br\/><br\/>Before pleading to the complaint and on motion of the fiscal the charge was dismissed as to Eduardo Casta\u00f1eda and Melecio Antonio for lack of evidence against them. After pleading to the complaint and before entering upon the trial, the fiscal entered a motion to dismiss the case against Juan Queja and Lino Barbaran, in order that they might be used as witnesses for the prosecution. This motion was granted by the court, and of the five defendants originally accused of this murder only Francisco Callapag was actually placed on trial. He was found guilty as accessory after the fact (<i>encubridor<\/i>), and was sentenced to twelve years and one day of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i> and to the payment of the costs of the proceedings. From this judgment of conviction he has now appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>It appears that Geronimo Canmayo on July 1, 1910, was appointed a corporal of police of the municipality of San Pablo, Isabela Province, and that he was killed by wounds inflicted upon him with cutting instruments on the night of July 5, 1910. The motive for the crime, suggested, but not quite satisfactorily established, was jealousy and enmity between the deceased and the accused, who were policemen in that municipality.<br\/><br\/>The prosecution introduced four witnesses, two of whom were the above-mentioned Juan Queja and Lino Barbaran, former co-defendants of the appellant. A careful examination of the testimony of these witnesses satisfies us that the appellant, jointly with these two witnesses, and perhaps others, attacked and killed the deceased on the night of the 5th of July, 1910. The statements of these witnesses are not wholly consistent. Each of them was manifestly influenced in making his statement by an anxious desire to minimize his own guilt, and to make his participation in the commission of the crime appear as slight as possible. As a result there are some contradictions in their evidence, and some inconsistencies in the statements of each. But reading all of their testimony together, and keeping in mind the admissions of the accused himself, we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused joined with them in unlawfully doing the deceased to death.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge, although he appears to have been morally convinced of the guilt of the accused, held that the defendant could not be found guilty upon the uncorroborated testimony of his accomplices; the more so, that their statements are somewhat contradictory and in some respects inconsistent.\u00a0 He found that the defendant was not proven guilty as principal. He, however, found him guilty as an accessory after the fact (<i>encubridor<\/i>) and sentenced him to twelve years and one day of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">reclusion temporal<\/span>, basing his conclusions strictly upon the admissions of the appellant that he knew of the commission of the crime, was present immediately after it had been committed, and did not report it to the authorities.<br\/><br\/>The Attorney-General does not take issue with the judge of the lower court in his finding that the evidence was not sufficient to convict the defendant as principal, the testimony of the accomplices not having been corroborated; nor does he question the finding of the trial judge that the defendant should have been convicted as an accessory after the fact (<i>encubridor<\/i>). But he suggests that the penalty of twelve years and one day of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i> is not the penalty prescribed by law for an accessory after the fact, and asks that it be reduced to two years eleven months and twelve days of <i>prision correccional<\/i>. In this recommendation the fiscal is manifestly correct if the defendant was properly convicted as an accessory after the fact. This court has on a number of occasions, however, decided that the mere silence of one knowing of the commission of a crime is not an offense under the Penal Code and does not in itself make the person an accessory after the fact. In the case of the United States vs. Romulo (15 Phil. Rep., 408) we considered at some length this precise question. In the case of the United States vs. Caballeros (4 Phil. Rep., 350) we stated that it was not an offense punishable under the Penal Code to refrain from reporting an offense to the proper authorities.\u00a0 We held in the case of U. S. vs. Romulo (<i>supra<\/i>) that if a party actually and actively deceives the authorities with reference to the commission of the crime of murder, or offers assistance to the perpetrators of the crime, enabling1 them to escape the vigilance of the authorities, then such a person is an accessory after the fact, but as we have before observed there is a distinction between such conduct as this and mere silence and nothing more. Adhering to the doctrine previously established and followed by this court, we do not think that the defendant could be held as an accessory after the fact merely because he did not report the offense to the proper authorities.<br\/><br\/>As we have said, however, we are of opinion that the evidence is sufficient to establish defendant's guilt as principal. This court has frequently discussed the question of the admissibility of the testimony of accomplices and the relative weight to be given to their testimony, and while we have announced that the testimony of an accomplice should be received with great caution and weighed with scrupulous care we have nevertheless definitely held that it is competent and admissible. (U. S. vs. Ocampo, 4 Phil. Rep., 400.) This case was again before the court upon a motion for a rehearing.\u00a0 (See U. S. vs. Ocampo, 5 Phil. Rep., 339.) In our decision upon this motion the court said: \"It is contended, however, that the evidence in this case rests on the uncorroborated testimony of accomplices, and this court is requested to lay down the rule that a finding of guilt can not be sustained upon such evidence. We are of opinion, however, that the lack of corroboration merely affects the credibility of the witness, and in no wise affects his competence, and that if his testimony satisfies the court as to the guilt of the accused, beyond a reasonable doubt, it is sufficient.\"<br\/><br\/>In the present case, the testimony of the witnesses Lino Barbaran and Juan Queja, together with the admissions made by the defendant himself and the statements of Dominga Bulan, satisfy us, beyond any reasonable doubt, of the guilt of the accused.<br\/><br\/>The defendant acknowledges that he was in the neighborhood of the crime; he claims that he left his house and followed Lino Barbaran and Juan Queja down to the river bank when they came and reported that \"the thing had been terminated;\" he offers no satisfactory explanation of his conduct in this connection. He was present when the body was disposed of and had full knowledge of the whole affair. Upon a consideration of the whole case and of the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution, we conclude that he acted as a principal jointly with others, was present when the crime was committed, and took part therein, and we so find.\u00a0 We do not undertake, however, to lay down the precise conditions under which the crime was committed, nor to hold that there were any qualifying circumstances other than that of nocturnity.<br\/><br\/>We therefore convict the defendant of the crime of homicide, with the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity, and, reversing the judgment and sentence of the court below, we impose upon him the penalty of seventeen years four months and one day of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i>, together with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, and the costs in both instances.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

while robbery with violence against persons m committed in an uninhabited place <em>or<\/em> in a\u00a0 gang.\u00a0 The Penal Code Spain says for both cases:\u00a0 \"In an uninhabited place and in a gang.\"\u00a0 The generic aggravating circumstance is expressed in the same way: \"To commit the\u00a0 crime at night or in an uninhabited place and in a gang,\" but not so the\u00a0 Philippine Code, which says: \"To commit it at night or in an uninhabited place or in a gang.\"\u00a0 But notwithstanding that wording of the Penal Code Spain, in a judgment of November\u00a0 6, 1880,\u00a0 the supreme court laid\u00a0 down the principle that if the acts of committing the crime by night or in an uninhabited place <em>and<\/em> in a\u00a0 gang\u00a0 constitute aggravating circumstance cannot be\u00a0 doubted that the three phrases\u00a0 which this\u00a0 clause\u00a0 grammatical contains refer to three different cases with the same legal force, to wit either the nighttime\u00a0 or an uninhabited place or a gang\u00a0 was selected for committing the crime.\u00a0 It is quite unreasonable that in robbery with force things it be necessary, in order to be qualified, that it be committed in uninhabited place and in a gang together, and that\u00a0 for robbery with violence\u00a0 against persons\u00a0 it be sufficient that it\u00a0 be committed in an uninhabited place or\u00a0 in\u00a0 a gang separately.<\/p><p>In the present case this interpretation tending to establish a precedent practically of no\u00a0 importance,\u00a0 on the\u00a0 supposition that article 509 prov that the penalty should be imposed\u00a0 in\u00a0 its maximum degree for qualified robbery, since the\u00a0 maximum degree\u00a0 (six years and one day)\u00a0 has been imposed\u00a0 upon the appellant Gil Revilla,\u00a0 although as guilty\u00a0 of\u00a0 simple robbery with three aggravating\u00a0 circumstances\u00a0 nocturnity, gang, and vagrancy.<\/p><p>What this court thinks\u00a0 improper is that he be punished, according to the opinion of the prosecution in this instance, with ten years\u00a0 of\u00a0 <em>presidio mayor<\/em> under No.\u00a0 5 of article 503,\u00a0 in connection with articles 504 and 505 because\u00a0 it is evidently not a question of robbery with violence against persons to which No. 5 of article\u00a0 503 refers.<\/p><p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this\u00a0 instance against the appellant Gil\u00a0 Revilla, except the proportional part of the c corresponding to Isidoro A.

After duly excepting to the ruling of  the  court, the defendant filed his answer  upon the 22d of January, 1910.<\/p>\n<p>It appears that upon the 26th of April, 1910,  the cause was set down  for  trial.

On the said 10th day of October, 1903, the defendant, Francisco Gutierrez Repide,  by means subsequently found  and adjudged to have  been fraudulent, obtained possession of said shares and thereafter alleged to be the owner thereof.  On the 12th day of January, 1904, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant in the  Court of First Instance of the city of Manila (case No. 2365) asking that the fraudulent sale by means of which the  defendant obtained possession of the said shares be declared null and void and that they be returned to her.  On the 29th of April, 1904, the Court of First  Instance of the city of Manila rendered its decision, finding in part as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Upon the facts stated, the court holds that the sale of thatee shares was made without the authority of Mrs. Strong, that she never ratified the sale but repudiated it as soon as she learned of it, that this sale was induced by fraud on the part of the defendant, and therefore was a fraudulent sale.<\/p>\n<p>\"The court, therefore, declares that the purchase of these shares of stock by the defendant is fraudulent and void, and it is ordered by the court that the same be set aside and for nothing held.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This judgment fixed the value of the shares at P38,352.71, awarding judgment in this amount to the plaintiff and directing that the said judgment might be satisfied by defendant's delivering to the plaintiff the said shares,  in which event the plaintiff should pay to the defendant $16,000 Mexican currency, or its equivalent in Philippine currency.  This judgment was, on appeal to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, reversed, and plaintiff's complaint dismissed on the merits.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> Thereupon plaintiff prosecuted an  appeal to the Supreme Court of the United  States, which court, on the 3d of May, 1909, rendered its judgment, reversing the decision of the Supreme  Court of the Philippine Islands and affirming the judgment of the trial court.  On the  27th of July,  1909, the said judgment  of April 29,  1904, was satisfied by defendant's returning to the plaintiff 800 shares of stock of said company, evidenced by certificates Nos. 1621, 1623,  1624, 1625, 1626, 1628, 1629, and 1630, and the payment by the plaintiff to the defendant of P14,159.29 Philippine  currency, equivalent to  $16,000 \"Mexican currency. Said satisfaction was effected by means of a stipulation or agreement entered into between the attorneys for the plaintiff and the  defendant, in which  the satisfaction  of the judgment was acknowledged by both  parties.  From the 10th day of  October, 1903, the  date of the said fraudulent purchase by the defendant, until the 27th day of July, 1909, the defendant retained said shares in his possession or under his  control  and after the rendition of said  judgment  of April 29,1904, collected the dividends earned by said shares for the years 1905, 1906, 1907, and  1908 at the rate  of 6 per cent per annum, amounting to a total of P19,200, which sum the defendant retained and refused'to pay over to the plaintiff.  After demand upon and refusal by the defendant, the plaintiff began this action for the recovery of said sum. On the 24th of March, 1911, the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the said sum of \u00a319,200, with interest  thereon  at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from  the date of the filing of the complaint, allowing to the  defendant as an  offset interest on P14,159.29 at 6 per cent per annum from October 10, 1903, to July 27, 1909, being the dates, respectively, of the purchase of the stock by the defendant and the satisfaction of the judgment in case No.  2365.  Both parties excepted  to this judgment and filed motions for a new trial, and the court upon the hearings modified its judgment by allowing defendant to offset against plaintiff's judgment interest on P14,159.29 at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the  10th day of October, 1903, to the  12th day of January, 1904, the latter date being that of plaintiff's tender of repayment to defendant.  From said judgment as modified the defendant prosecutes this appeal.  The plaintiff is satisfied.<\/p>\n<p>The appellant in this case relies for the success of this appeal upon the form of the judgment of  the court below in said action No. 2365.   He asserts that that judgment is for a sum of money and not for the rescission of a contract and the return of shares of stock.  This being so, he maintains that the payment of the sum named in the judgment, whether by money or by shares of stock, was a complete satisfaction of the judgment in that case.  The mere fact that it was paid in shares of stock did not indicate that the judgment of the trial court was for shares of stock but said  judgment was, on the contrary, in reality and in legal effect for a sum of money which could be paid in shares of stock as well as in coin of the realm.   Basing himself upon this contention appellant asserts that that judgment having been satisfied by the payment of the sum adjudged to be  due, a subsequent action for dividends on said stock is in effect an action for interest on .the said sum found to be due, that  it affects the subject  matter of a judgment already paid and discharged.<\/p>\n<p>We do not  believe  that  the contention of the  appellant is sound.   The action begun in the trial court was to set aside a  sale made  by the plaintiff to the  defendant and for the return of the shares of stock which were the subject of that sale.   The basis of that action was  the claim that the plaintiff had been deprived of the shares of stock in question by false and fraudulent representations and fraudulent concealment on the part of the defendant, or of his agents, and that thereby she had been induced to part with those shares without just compensation and, in reality, without her legal consent.  The trial court  found  in favor of the  plaintiff, declaring the sale of the  stock  to  have  been fraudulently obtained and setting aside the sale absolutely, as is indicated by that portion of its opinion heretofore quoted.  On the appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States the fraudulent character of the representations by which the plaintiff had  been induced to part with her stock was fully affirmed after a  thorough consideration of the  facts and  circumstances of the case  and the judgment of  the trial court setting aside the sale on the ground of fraud was affirmed in every particular.  It is a  necessary  conclusion, therefore, that the action was in reality for the  return of the stock itself, with appropriate damages in case the return was not made by the  defendant.  The finding of the court that the value of the  stock was P138,352.71 was not made for the purpose of declaring the  nature of the action to be one for the recovery  of money, but rather, for the purpose of giving to the plaintiff her alternative remedy in case the stock itself should not be returned.  That the same identical shares of stock obtained by the defendant were not, as a matter of fact, returned to plaintiff is not controlling. They were identical in everything except  their numbers and  were tendered and received in fulfillment of the provisions of the  judgment.  All  of the stock of said company was  of the same  kind and paid the same dividend.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment  of  the trial court, as affirmed by  the Supreme Court of  the United  States,  set aside the  sale as fraudulent, and, therefore, by necessary result,  the title to the shares  of stock in question passed to the plaintiff if it be conceded that the title ever legally passed from her.  The delivery of those  shares to  her by the defendant under that judgment was an admission of her title as declared by the court and was a delivery of possession in pursuance of that declaration of ownership.  Under the decisions referred to, as between the parties thereto, the plaintiff  was legally the owner of said stock from the time when she was fraudulently deprived of it until the time it was returned to her as fully and  as completely as she was after the  adjudication of the title  and return  of  the  stock  itself.  Whoever, therefore, during that period collected the dividends upon the said stock took from the plaintiff something which belonged to her. While the defendant asserts that he was at no time the owner of said stock, the finding of the trial court and the finding of the Supreme Court of the United States on appeal were to the effect that the defendant was the real purchaser of the stock from the plaintiff under the fraudulent sale, although the negotiations leading up to the sale were carried on by other persons.  The fraudulent sale having been made to him, it is unquestionable  that he became responsible to the plaintiff from that  moment forward.   So  far as the responsibility of the defendant was concerned, it is of no consequence who actually collected and  retained the dividends. The plaintiff had a  right to look to the defendant and to him alone.<\/p>\n<p>Unless, therefore, the plaintiff has, by some act subsequent to obtaining the  judgment referred to, released her rights to recover of the defendant  the income of the stock during the time he held it, that right still subsists.   The consideration of this question  brings us to the other contention of the appellant.  It is to the effect that when the judgment in question was paid a stipulation or agreement was entered into between him and the plaintiff by virtue of .which the plaintiff released him  from  all responsibility in connection with the transaction relating to the stock.  That agreement, translated, reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I,  W.  H. Lawrence, lawyer,  with full authority  from the plaintiff in the  above-entitled action for the purpose of this instrument; and I, Eduardo  Gutierrez Repide, lawyer, and being also fully authorized  and empowered hereto by the defendant  in said action, now, for  the purpose of satisfying the judgment rendered therein,  I, W. H.  Lawrence, hereby deliver to Eduardo  Gutierrez Pl4,159.29, and L Eduardo Gutierrez, on my  part deliver to said  W. H. Lawrence the costs of this  action and eight certificates of stock of the Philippine Sugar  Estates Development Company, each certificate representing 100 shares, which certificates are of the par value of P10,000 each, and are numbered 1621,1628,1624,1625,1626,1628,1629, and 1630.  Wherefore, both parties agree and stipulate that, by reason of the said payments hereby mutually made, the judgment in the above-entitled action is entirely paid and the action is finally settled and terminated, together  with all the legal results flowing from said judgment.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>We see nothing  in this written discharge which  could properly be given the legal effects which the appellant in this case assigns  to  it.   It is a discharge of a judgment and nothing more.  Being such, it reaches no further than the terms of the judgment itself.  It  is to be presumed that an instrument satisfying a debt or obligation  manifested in another instrument extends no further than the terms of the instrument which manifests the obligation to be discharged, unless, from the terms of that instrument, it is clear that the parties  intended something more.  So far as the record discloses, at the time this satisfaction was executed nothing whatever occurred  between the parties relative to the dividends on the stock  which formed  the subject-matter of that judgment, nor did anything transpire as to any other relations between the, parties than those embraced within the judgment itself.   There  was nothing in the conduct of the parties, or in their relations or attitudes, from which it could be implied or inferred that they were dealing with aught else than the judgment  itself.  There is no basis, then, for the contention of the appellant  unless  it be found in the wording of that instrument itself.  As we have already  indicated, however, there is nothing in the  phraseology of that  document which in the  remotest way touches  the rights of the parties  as to ths dividends upon the stock  or which embraces any other matter between the parties than the subject matter of the judgment itself.  The words employed ih such an instrument should not be extended beyond the consideration upon which the instrument was executed as otherwise the courts would  be making for the parties a release which they never intended or contemplated.<\/p>\n<p>Relative  to the scope  and extent of the satisfaction referred to the trial court  said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"While it may appear from the stipulation entered into when  the judgment  was satisfied between the parties interchanging the shares of stock and money, as before stated, that the plaintiff had no further, claim against the defendant, because at that time the plaintiff paid the defendant a large sum of money without making claim, it also appears that the plaintiff was  not aware that the  defendant had collected the dividends before referred to.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In arguing this question plaintiff's counsel devotes himself at some length to sustaining this finding of fact, and asserts that \"even had she been aware of this fact it would make no difference for the reason that the matter of dividends was not and could not have been involved in the original suit.\"   It is true that the dividends  were not included in the  cause of action set forth in the complaint in cause No. 2365 and were hot, therefore, a subject of adjudication in that action.  We are of the opinion, however, that  they might have been, at least in part.  The  plaintiff in suing for the recovery of shares  illegally  taken from her by the defendant had, the right to demand  their  return and with them whatever damages she had sustained by reason of their retention, which  would be in this case the dividends which had been collected on them  by the defendant while they were  in his possession.  That is, strictly speaking, what the  plaintiff should have demanded in her complaint.  Generally speaking, it  is not permitted that a plaintiff sue for the recovery of property which is illegally detained by another, and, after recovering that  property, sue in  a separate  action for the damages sustained by that illegal detention.  The law seeks to prevent multiplicity of actions, and it is the duty  of every person  suing to join in one action every cause of action which  he  has against the defendant, to the end  that all questions between the parties be litigated in one suit, and multiplicity  of actions and resulting  expenses prevented This is  a question, however, which could  have been raised in the  court  below by the defendant.  He did not do so. Neither has he  raised the question in this court directly. We, therefore, do not pass upon it or base any finding upon it.  The purpose which we have in referring to it at all is to indicate  that the real question arising from the controversy between the parties relative  to  this  particular assignment  of error really resolves itself into  one of multiplicity of actions, that is, of the duty of the plaintiff to join all her causes of action against the defendant  in one complaint, and  not  the  one  presented by  the appellant in his argument relative to the reach which should be given to the document of satisfaction.  We, therefore, disapprove of the contention of the appellant  that the  satisfaction  of  the judgment reaches further than the terms of the judgment itself.   It does not embrace any other relations  between the parties  than those embraced  in the plain wording of  the judgment.  While the dividends might, in part,  have been included in the cause of action set  forth in the complaint in that action and, as far as possible, should have been incorporated therein, nevertheless  they were not so made and, therefore, formed no part of the  judgment in which that action terminated.  When, therefore, after the satisfaction of that judgment, plaintiff began a separate action to recover the dividends, the only defense available to the  defendant was the plea of multiplicity.  That plea not having been made, no question relating  thereto is  presented on this appeal.<\/p>\n<p>It is true that plaintiff could have included in her action and recovered at the most only those dividends which were due at  the  time judgment in her favor was  entered.   It happens in  this case that most of the dividends became payable  after  the  plaintiff  had  secured  her judgment. That being so,  they  could not have been included  by  her in the original complaint, nor could they have been incorporated within  the judgment in that action.  This, then, furnishes another reason why the contention of the appellant in  this regard cannot be sustained.  tJnder  such  circumstances  a plea of multiplicity, even if made,  would  not have been available as  to those dividends which became payable  after the  judgment was entered in that action.<\/p>\n<p>The remaining  question presented by  appellant relates to the interest  which he was entitled to recover or the amount due him from the plaintiff.  As  we have already seen, the judgment of the court in the first place  gave him the interest on said amount from the 10th day of October, 1903, to the 27th day of July, 1909.  On motion made by the plaintiff the court amended that judgment by giving the defendant interest on said sum from the 10th day of October, 1903, to the 12th  day of  January,  1904.   The reason for the amendment  was the  fact,  as  disclosed by the proofs, that on the  latter  date the plaintiff tendered to the defendant said sum of money  and the defendant at that time refused  to  accept the same.  Under such  circumstances, the court properly  held that  the  tender of the sum and its refusal by the defendant stopped  the running of interest in  favor of the latter and  he  was  not, therefore, entitled to recover interest from that day  forward.  The appellant  argues in this connection  that he should not be blamed or  punished for the  refusal to accept the tender of the plaintiff for the reason that he  was not the owner of  the stock  at  the time of such tender  and,  therefore, could not accept  it.   As we have already  seen in touching another question  raised on  this appeal,  the court, in a judgment now final,  found that the sale  of stock afterwards declared fraudulent was executed  between the plaintiff and the defendant.  As to this there can be no question.  As  a necessary result  the plaintiff need  look for her redress no further than the defendant himself  and she could produce all  of the legal  effects  possible in  her favor by dealing directly with him, as she did when  she made the  tender in question.<br\/>\n  For these reasons the judgment appealed from is affirmed, without special finding as to costs.  So ordered.<\/p>\n<em>Torres,  Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 6 Phil.

The stipulation  is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"1.  That the plaintiff was  appointed election inspector of the precinct of Daraga, municipality of Albay, on the 13th day of September, 1909, and did qualify and act as such election inspector in the general elections held in this province on November 2, 1909.<\/p>\n<p>\"2.  That on  February 26,  1910, the plaintiff presented to the municipal council of Albay his written  resignation from the office of election  inspector.<\/p>\n<p>\"3.  That the municipal council  of  Albay, at its  session of March  7, 1910, accepted  the resignation  tendered  by the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>\"4.  That on March 21, 1910, at the session held by the municipal council of  Albay, the municipal president of the said municipality appointed the plaintiff lieutenant of police of Albay, which appointment was unanimously approved by the council; and on the  following day, March 22, 1910, the municipal president issued to  the  said  plaintiff  the proper certificate of appointment.<\/p>\n<p>\"5.  That on March 22, 1910, the plaintiff legally qualified for, and took possession of, the office of lieutenant of police of the municipality of Albay.<\/p>\n<p>\"6,  That on March 26,  1910, the  municipal  president of Albay,  acting in pursuance of an  order received from the provincial governor, suspended the plaintiff's appointment  and  summoned  the latter  to appear before the provincial board  of Albay on the  29th of March,  1910,  for the purpose of deciding upon the legality of his appointment  as such lieutenant of police, in view of his having discharged the  duties  of  election  inspector in  the  last election.<\/p>\n<p>\"7.  That on March 29, 1910, the plaintiff, through  his attorney, appeared before  the  provincial board  and  demanded  that  it abstain from passing any resolution with respect to the legality  of  the  said  appointment, alleging that the said board lacked both the power and the jurisdiction so  to  do; but that the board did, notwithstanding, disapprove the resolution passed by the  municipal council of Albay on March 21, 1910.<\/p>\n<p>\"8.  That on March  26, 1910, the plaintiff, ceased to discharge the duties  of  the office of lieutenant  of  police of Albay, and, by the aforecited  resolution of the provincial board, is prevented from  holding  the said office in  the future.<\/p>\n<p>\"9. That the municipal  council of  Albay resolved  not to  appeal, and  did not appeal, administratively to  the Honorable  Governor-General  from  the resolution of  the provincial  board, and  the  said council  does not permit nor will  it permit the plaintiff to occupy or again to take possession  of  the said  office.<\/p>\n<p>\"10. That the  provincial  board is  disposed to carry out its resolution disapproving the appointment of the plaintiff, and to prevent the latter from continuing in the discharge of the  duties of the office of lieutenant of police.<\/p>\n<p>\"11. Both  parties  agree,  furthermore, that the  court admit  and  consider  the  following  documents,  attached hereto and marked as Exhibits A, B,  C, D, E, F, G, H, and I.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Section 15  of the Election  Law  (Act  No. 1582)  contains the provision for the appointment of inspectors of elections, among other things.  Said section also provides that:<\/p>\n<p>\"Said inspectors shall  be ineligible to be elected or appointed to any other office during their term of office.\"<\/p>\n<p>Said section further provides that the \"inspectors of elections  *   *   *  shall hold office for two years,\" from the date of their appointment.<\/p>\n<p>From the stipulated facts  above quoted,  it will be  seen that  the  plaintiff was appointed as election  inspector on the 13th  of September, 1909, and  resigned  on the 26th of February, 1910, and was appointed by the municipal president  as <em>\"teniente de policia\"<\/em> on the 21st of March,  1910, which appointment was approved by the municipal council on the 22d of March, 1910.  It will thus be seen that the plaintiff accepted  an appointive position within the period of two years  from the date of  his appointment as election inspector.  The provincial  board, upon  receiving notice of the appointment as \"<em>teniente de policia<\/em>,\" immediately ordered the municipal  council to revoke the appointment, relying upon the provisions of section  15 above referred to. Immediately upon the revocation of said appointment, the plaintiff  presented a  petition  for  a  writ  of prohibition against the provincial board as well as the municipal council, to prevent them from carrying into effect  the said revocation.  The  lower  court  issued  said  writ.   From  that order the  defendants appealed to this court.<\/p>\n<p>Several questions are presented by the brief filed by the Attorney-General.   The plaintiff presented no brief.<\/p>\n<p>In  our  opinion  the  only  question which it  is necessary to discuss in the present  case is whether or not that provision of  section 15 which  provides that \"said inspectors shall be ineligible  to be elected  or  appointed to any other office during their term of office,\" renders ineligible an inspector of elections from accepting an appointive office after the acceptance of his resignation and  within his \"term of office\" (two years).   Of course what is said here with reference to the acceptance of an appointive  office will also be applicable to the acceptance of an elective office.<\/p>\n<p>The lower court reached the conclusion that said provision did not apply after the resignation of the inspector, and cited  in  support of that conclusion the case of Barnum <em>vs.<\/em> Gilman  (27 Minn., 466, decided March 29, 1881).  The constitution of the State of Minnesota, among other things, provides that - <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"No senator or representative (state)  shall, during the time for which he is elected, hold any office, under the authority of the United States, or the State of Minnesota, except that of postmaster.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In  that case (Barnum <em>vs.<\/em> Gilman)  the respondent was elected as lieutenant-governor of the State of Minnesota in the year 1879, for the term commencing January 1, 188O at the time of his nomination he was  holding  the office of representative in the legislature, under an election for the term  extending to the 1st of January, 1881; but prior to the said state election he resigned his office as representative and his resignation was duly accepted.   Mr. Justice Cornell, in writing the opinion in that case ;for the majority of the court, said;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When he ceases to be such (senator or representative) whether by the lapse of time, resignation or otherwise, the disability terminates.  The  clause, 'during the time  for which he is elected can not  properly be construed as enlarging the scope of the prohibition so  as to include persons not in fact members of the legislature.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This case (Barnum <em>vs.<\/em> Gilman) has  been cited in support of the proposition that after the resignation of officers in- cluded in the provisions of the constitution, and the resignation is accepted, such persons are no longer  bound by such provisions.   We find, however, that this same question came before the  supreme court of the State of Minnesota again in the case of State vs. Sutton  (63  Minn., 147, decided December 12, 1895).  The supreme court of Minnesota, referring to the case of Barnum vs. Gilman, said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"We must regard what was there said in reference to the constitutional provision here under consideration as mere obiter.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the case of State <em>vs.<\/em> Sutton, <em>supra<\/em>, the supreme court (of Minnesota) held that under this constitutional provision, the disability of a member of the legislature to hold office does not cease <em>until the expiration of the full period of time for which he was elected.<\/em><br\/>\n<br\/>\nEven granting  that the decision in the case  of Barnum <em>vs.<\/em> Gilman decided that a senator or representative might be relieved from thje operation of,the constitutional provision by resigning, the same is expressly overruled in the case of State vs.  Sutton, supra.  In the latter case Mr.  Sutton was elected to the  office of  representative  on the 6th of November, 1894, for  the term commencing on the first Monday of January, 1895, and ending on the first Monday of January, 1897.  Pursuant to his election he.duly qualified and entered upon the discharge of his duties as such member and served until the 2d of May, 1895.  On the 4th of May, 1895, Mr. Sutton was appointed to the public office of inspector of boilers for the fourth congressional district, and qualified and entered upon the  performance of the duties of that office. Proceedings were  commenced to  oust him of his office and the court in deciding the case said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We are of the opinion that the respondent, in holding the office of inspector of boilers, as charged in the writ of quo warranto, <em>comes within  the prohibition of the constitution (art.  4,  sec. 9),  and it is therefore adjudged that  said respondent, John B.  Sutton, is guilty of unlawfully  holding and exercising the  office of inspector of boilers for the fourth congressional district  in this state.  And it  is further ordered and adjudged that  said John B.  Sutton be ousted and excluded from said office of inspector of boilers and that judgment be entered accordingly.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The question which we are discussing here came before the supreme court of the State of Michigan in the case of Ellis <em>vs.<\/em> Lennon (86 Mich., 468, decided June term, 1891). In Michigan the general law for the incorporation of cities contains the following provision:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"No alderman shall be elected or appointed to any other office in the city <em>during the term for which he was  elected as alderman,<\/em> nor appointed to any other office in the city within one year thereafter.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The constitution of the State of Michigan also provides the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"No person elected a member of the legislature snail receive  any civil appointment within this State, or to  the Senate of the United States, from the governor, the governor and senate, from the legislature, or any other State authority, <em>during the term for which he is elected.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the said case of Ellis <em>vs.<\/em> Lennon supra, a member of the city council resigned his position and was appointed chief of police.   <em>Quo warranto<\/em>  proceedings were  commenced against him.  The supreme  court decided that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"An alderman,   *  *  *,  can not, by resigning his office prior to the expiration of the term for which he was elected, render himself eligible to receive the appointment of chief of police.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the case of Waldo vs. Wallace (12 Ind., 569)  it appears that Wallace was mayor of the city of Indianapolis and that during the continuance of his term of office as such he resigned, became a candidate and received the highest number of votes for the office of sheriff of his county.  His right to hold the office of sheriff was presented  to the courts.  The court held that he could not exercise the duties of the office of sheriff,  for the reason that his election to the latter office occurred during the  continuance of his term  as mayor. (See also Gulick <em>vs.<\/em> New, 14 Ind.,  93.)<\/p>\n<p>Provisions similar  to that contained in said  section  15 of Act No. 1582 are found in the constitutions of many of the States of the United States.   It is a common provision of municipal charters.  The purpose of such provision is to guard against trafficking in office and the further purpose is to remove from the incumbent of the office any inducement for causing a vacancy.   (Ellis <em>vs.<\/em> Lennon, 86 Mich., 468; Waldo <em>vs.<\/em> Wallace, 12 Ind., 569; Shelby <em>vs.<\/em> Alcorn, 36 Miss., 273; Sublett <em>vs.<\/em> Bedwell, 47 Miss., 266; Smith <em>vs.<\/em> Moore, 90 Ind.,  294; Story on Constitutional Law, sections 867-869.)<\/p>\n<p>Another purpose for the existence of such constitutional or statutory provisions is to prevent officers  from using their official positions in the creation of offices for themselves, or for the appointment of themselves to other more lucrative positions.  The law of course  recognizes  the right of an official to resign under certain circumstances, but the policy of the law as announced in said section 15 of Act No. 1582 is to take away from public officials all inducements to  the vacation of their  office.   The  provision of said section 15 seems to be clear.  It says that  \"said  inspectors  shall be ineligible to be elected or appointed during their term of office.\"   The time included within the phrase <em>\"during their term  of office\"<\/em> is  easy to compute.   Laws should be given their  natural interpretation.   Had the legislature intended that said inspectors  should  be ineligible  to be elected or appointed simply during the time  which they held the office of an inspector, the language of the  statute would have been  different.  The statute  naturally would  have read: \"During the time they  continue  to  hold  the  office of  inspector.\" The statute, however,  is broader.  It used  the phrase  <em>\"during their term of office.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>\"<\/em>  In reading said section  it will be noted that inspectors  of elections  are appointed for  a term of two  years.   Statutes should be construed so as to give  every word and  phrase  used its common and approved meaning.  If it had been the intention of the Legislature  to limit the prohibition to the term of actual service, or simply to make  inspectors of elections ineligible to other offices  during the term of  actual service, the phrase \"during their term of office\" would  have been substituted  by  the phrase  \"during  the term  of  actual service.\"<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons we are  fully persuaded that inspectors of  elections are ineligible  to be elected or  appointed to any other office during their term of office, and this prohibition is not limited to their term of actual service.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the lower court  is therefore  hereby reversed and the defendants are absolved from any liability under the petition presented in the lower court for the writ of prohibition, with costs against the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<em>Arellano,  C.

It appears that the\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 was duly\u00a0 elected president\u00a0 of the\u00a0 municipality\u00a0 of Lingayen, Province\u00a0 of\u00a0 Pangasinan. After his election the defendant protested that election upon two grounds:<p>First.\u00a0 That the plaintiff\u00a0 was ineligible to\u00a0 hold the office of municipal president\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the ground that he had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.<\/p><p>Second. That\u00a0 ballots had been\u00a0 counted\u00a0 in\u00a0 favor of the plaintiff\u00a0 which,\u00a0 as a matter of fact,\u00a0 should not\u00a0 have been counted\u00a0 for\u00a0 him and which\u00a0 were sufficient\u00a0 to\u00a0 reduce the number\u00a0\u00a0 of\u00a0 votes which he\u00a0 actually\u00a0 received below that received by\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant.<\/p><p>The court heard the protest and decided in favor of the defendant upon the ground last mentioned, declining the consideration of the eligibility of the plaintiff to such office.<\/p><p>This action was begun upon the sole theory and founded upon the single ground that the decision of the court in the protest mentioned was\u00a0 null\u00a0 and void for the reason that not all of the candidates voted for for that office had been notified of the\u00a0 protest as required\u00a0 by law and that, therefore, the court\u00a0 was without jurisdiction or power to enter the judgment which it did enter in favor of the defendant. It is the contention that\u00a0 the court being entirely without jurisdiction\u00a0 and, therefore, its judgment in\u00a0 favor\u00a0 of the defendant being null and void, the defendant is usurping the office and unlawfully excluding the plaintiff therefrom.<\/p><p>While this is an action of <em>quo warranto<\/em>, we have so far treated it in the nature of a\u00a0 certiorari as to require the elevation to this court of the record made in the court below relative to said protest.\u00a0 From that record it appears that the very question of the notice to all of the candidates voted for at said\u00a0 election for the office, of municipal president was raised before the court below and fully considered and decided by it.\u00a0 After the entry of the judgment in favor of the defendant, a motion\u00a0 was made by the plaintiff to vacate and\u00a0 set aside\u00a0 said\u00a0 judgment and to\u00a0 dismiss the whole\u00a0 proceeding upon\u00a0 the ground\u00a0 that not all\u00a0 of said candidates had been notified of the protest as required\u00a0 by law.\u00a0 The motion was heard.\u00a0 The question was litigated. The evidence\u00a0 was discussed and\u00a0 considered.\u00a0 The\u00a0 arguments\u00a0 of\u00a0 counsel were\u00a0 presented.\u00a0 The court found from the evidence that all of the candidates had\u00a0 been\u00a0 notified of the protest\u00a0 and that the notice was\u00a0 in the form and served in\u00a0 the manner and within the time required by the statute.\u00a0 That question having been raised before the court below and passed upon there, we are unable to see\u00a0 at this moment how an action of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">quo warranto<\/span> can be maintained, based upon the theory that such notice was lacking.\u00a0 That question having been determined\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 court below, and the decision\u00a0 never\u00a0 having\u00a0 been\u00a0 questioned\u00a0 in the\u00a0 only manner in which such a decision\u00a0 can be, we must hold it conclusive in this action, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">quo warranto<\/span> not being a method by\u00a0 which that decision can be reviewed.\u00a0 We are,\u00a0 therefore, of the opinion that the action must be dismissed.<\/p><p>The complaint is hereby dismissed.\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano,\u00a0 C.\u00a0 J.,\u00a0 Torres,\u00a0 Mapa,\u00a0 Johnson, Carson,<\/em>\u00a0 and <em>Trent, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p><p><br\/><\/p><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><p align=\"center\"> <br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 <strong>ON REHEARING<\/strong><\/p><p align=\"right\"> JANUARY\u00a0 22, 1913.<\/p><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><p>A motion for permission\u00a0 to proceed with the action of <em>quo warranto<\/em> and to take testimony relative to the question whether all the candidates voted for at the election referred to in these proceedings had been regularly notified of the initiation of the protest.<\/p><p>We have to say, in\u00a0 amplification of our former opinion on this question, that the general rule is that, where the jurisdiction\u00a0 of the court depends\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the existence of facts, and the court\u00a0 judicially considers and\u00a0 adjudicates the question of its jurisdiction, and decides that the facts exist which are necessary to give it jurisdiction of the case, the finding is conclusive and\u00a0 cannot be\u00a0 controverted in a collateral\u00a0 proceeding.\u00a0\u00a0 (Phelps\u00a0 <em>vs.<\/em>\u00a0 The\u00a0 Mutual\u00a0 Reserve Fund, 112 Fed., 453;\u00a0 S.

Each was also sentenced to the accessory penalties provided by law, and to the payment of\u00a0 one-half of the costs of the cause.\u00a0 Both appealed and make the following assignment of errors.\u00a0 <blockquote><p> \"l. The\u00a0 court erred in finding the accused guilty\u00a0 under the complaint\u00a0 presented in this case, because of not having acquired\u00a0 jurisdiction.\u00a0 <\/p><p> \"2. The\u00a0 court erred in\u00a0 declaring\u00a0 the accused guilty because the proofs do not show that the alleged crime was committed within the jurisdiction of the court.\u00a0 <\/p><p> \"3. The\u00a0 judge erred\u00a0 in\u00a0 declaring\u00a0 the accused guilty because the proofs do not show their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 <\/p><p> \"4. The\u00a0 court\u00a0 erred in finding the\u00a0 concurrence of the aggravating circumstance that the\u00a0 crime had been\u00a0 committed in the house of the offended party.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> The first and\u00a0 second assignments of error relate to the jurisdiction of the court, and can be\u00a0 considered together. The complaint in this case,\u00a0 presented\u00a0 on\u00a0 the 24th of February, 1911, and which\u00a0 was signed and\u00a0 sworn to by the offended\u00a0 party,\u00a0 did not contain any\u00a0 allegation that the crime was committed within the city of Manila.\u00a0\u00a0 The case was called for hearing on March 1 of that year.\u00a0 By agreement, the hearing was transferred until the 9th.\u00a0 The prosecuting attorney, immediately after it was agreed that the case should be transferred, filed a motion asking permission to amend the complaint by inserting the words \"in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The two accused and their attorney were present\u00a0 when\u00a0 this motion\u00a0 was\u00a0 made and offered no\u00a0 objection. The correction\u00a0 was granted by the court,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the complaint so amended.\u00a0 On March 9th the defendants pleaded not guilty and the case went to\u00a0 trial. No objection was made to the sufficiency of the complaint by demurrer or otherwise in the court below.\u00a0 In the sylabus to Serra <em>vs.<\/em> Mortiga, 204 U. S.,\u00a0 470\u00a0 (reported in\u00a0 11 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 762), it\u00a0 is said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p> \"While a complaint on a charge of adultery\u00a0 under the Penal Code of the Philippine Islands may be fatally defective for lack of essential averments as to\u00a0 place and knowledge on the part of the man that the woman was married, objections of that nature must be taken at\u00a0 the trial, and if not taken, and the omitted averments are supplied by competent proof, it is not error for the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands to refuse to sustain such objections on appeal.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> In the case of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Estrana (16 Phil. Rep., 520), this court said:\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p> \"No objections to the sufficiency of the\u00a0 complaint\u00a0 were made in the court below, and it is now well settled that it is not error for this court to refuse to sustain such objections taken for the first\u00a0 time on appeal when the fatal defects in the complaint are <em>supplied<\/em> by competent proof.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> So it is clear that the question raised in this court for the first time with\u00a0 reference to the sufficiency of the\u00a0 complaint\u00a0 is not well founded.\u00a0 But it is said\u00a0 that the proofs do not show that the crime was committed within the jurisdiction of the lower\u00a0 court.\u00a0 If the appellants had illicit relations, the acts were committed in the house of the offended husband, Arcadio de la\u00a0 Ysla.\u00a0 The latter testified that\u00a0 he lived at No. 300 Calle Herran, city of Manila, Philippine Islands.\u00a0 He did not see the actual crime\u00a0 committed, but says that he did see the appellants hugging and\u00a0 kissing in his house on Calle Herran.\u00a0\u00a0 The witness Vicente Binapasoc testified that he saw the appellants cohabiting in a room in the house of the injured husband at No. 300 Calle Herran. He did not state that this\u00a0 house was situated in Manila, but he did state, as we have said, that the acts were committed in the house of the offended party.\u00a0 Other witnesses testified to the same effect as Binapasoc.\u00a0 The testimony of all these witnesses read and considered as\u00a0 a whole, as it should be, shows as clearly that the acts complained of were committed within the city of Manila as if it had been specifically stated by each that the house of the\u00a0 offended party was located in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands.<\/p><p> The third assignment of error raises a question of fact. All admit, that Arcadio de la Ysla and the appellant Genoveva Destrito are husband and wife and that for some eight or nine months prior to February 3, 1911, the other appellant Gerardo de Ocampo, lived with this married couple in their house, and that both the appellants left this house on that date and have not returned.\u00a0\u00a0 According to the testimony of Ysla, he saw his wife and Ocampo on the second of February riding\u00a0 in\u00a0 a <em>carromata,<\/em>\u00a0 Ocampo\u00a0 with his arm around Genoveva's waist, and Genoveva with her\" head lying on Ocampo's shoulder,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that on the following day on entering his house he saw Ocampo and his wife hugging and kissing in a corner of the room; that he then immediately ordered Ocampo to leave the house and told his\u00a0 wife to follow him; and that they both left.<\/p><p> The wife testified that when her husband entered\u00a0 the house on\u00a0 that\u00a0 day, the 3d\u00a0 of February, he immediately demanded\u00a0 of her\u00a0 forty pesos which he claimed she had received from certain\u00a0 parties,\u00a0 and that as\u00a0 she\u00a0 could\u00a0 not produce the money,\u00a0 not having\u00a0 received\u00a0 it, he began\u00a0 to abuse\u00a0 and insult\u00a0 her,\u00a0 and drove her\u00a0 from her home. Ocampo testified that on that date he requested the offended party to render an account\u00a0 of a certain business in which they were both interested, as Ysla was the treasurer of the company,\u00a0 and that on making this demand Ysla became very angry and ordered him to leave.\u00a0 Ysla, sometime prior to the time this trouble arose, attempted to organize a small company for the purchase and sale of the products of the country.\u00a0 It appears that Ocampo prepared\u00a0 the by-laws and constitution of this company, and on\u00a0 account of being somewhat versed in these matters, he received an invitation from Ysla and his wife to make his home with them and become director-general of the company.\u00a0 But he at no time placed any money in the concern, nor rendered it any services of value.\u00a0 In fact, practically all the assets of the com- pany existed on paper.\u00a0 The company was a failure and there was no reason for demanding an accounting of Ysla because there was nothing to account\u00a0 for.\u00a0 Ysla\u00a0 did have and was running a small <em>tienda<\/em> near\u00a0 his house.\u00a0\u00a0 So it is quite strange that Ocampo should have demanded an\u00a0 accounting of Ysla at any time, and especially at the time he and his wife had\u00a0 quarrelled\u00a0 and she as a result had left the house.\u00a0\u00a0 As a matter of fact, there is nothing to support the contention of the latter that her husband brought on the quarrel on account of the forty\u00a0 pesos. The offended husband had his suspicions\u00a0 aroused on the 2d when he saw the two appellants riding\u00a0 in a <em>carromata<\/em>\u00a0 and\u00a0 had decided to watch their conduct.\u00a0\u00a0 Both the appellants admit that they were riding in a <em>carromata<\/em>,\u00a0 but deny that they were in that compromising position.\u00a0 Aside from the testimony of the offended husband, there appears in the record the testimony of at least three witnesses, all of whom testified that they saw the two appellants in the act of cohabitation prior to February 3, 1911, and that these\u00a0 illicit\u00a0 relations took place in the house of the offended party, No. 300 Calle Herran.\u00a0 There\u00a0 is nothing in the record\u00a0 which shows or even tends to show that these three witnesses were not telling the truth.\u00a0 They lived in the\u00a0 immediate vicinity, and in fact one of them was living in the house of the offended husband when he surprised the appellants\u00a0 committing this unlawful act.\u00a0 The trial court believed that these witnesses testified the truth and found the appellants guilty\u00a0 of the crime of adultery.\u00a0 This finding of fact is fully supported by the testimony of record.<\/p><p> The trial court found and applied the aggravating circumstance of <em>morada,<\/em> and also, with reference to Ocampo, the aggravating circumstance of abuse of confidence.\u00a0 It is true that the crime was committed in the house of the offended husband, but it is likewise true that this\u00a0 same house was the home of both\u00a0 the appellants.\u00a0 Genoveva and Ocampo had a right to be in the house, the former because she was the wife of Ysla,\u00a0 and the latter because that was then his place of residence, he having gone there to live on the joint invitation of Ysla\u00a0 and his wife.\u00a0 Under these facts\u00a0 it was error to apply the aggravating circumstance\u00a0 of morada. (Decision supreme court of Spain, November 16, 1871, published in Official Gazette, January 9,1872.)\u00a0\u00a0 The trial court committed no error in applying the aggravating circumstance of abuse of confidence in imposing the penalty upon Ocampo, inasmuch as\u00a0 the record\u00a0 clearly shows that the offended husband\u00a0 took Ocampo into his home, furnished him with food and lodging without charge, and treated him like a son.<\/p><p> With\u00a0 reference to Genoveva, there being no aggravating and no\u00a0 extenuating circumstances,\u00a0 the penalty should\u00a0 be imposed in its medium degree.\u00a0 This was done by the court.<\/p><p> With reference to Gerardo de Ocampo, there being presents pne aggravating circumstance and no extenuating circumstances, the sentence should be imposed in\u00a0 its maximum degree.\u00a0 This\u00a0 was likewise done by the\u00a0 court.<\/p><p> With\u00a0 the modifications as above set forth, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellants. So ordered,<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson, <\/em> and <em>Carson, JJ<\/em>., concur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

Lozano accompanied the defendant as requested, with his carabao, believing that it was necessary.<\/p><p> After the defendants and Lozano had left the house of the latter a short distance, the\u00a0 defendants by force and violence took possession of the carabao and ran away.\u00a0 It may be true that there was no force or violence exercised by the defendant and his companions in the first instance, but\u00a0 certainly it is\u00a0 true that at the time\u00a0 he and\u00a0 his companions took possession of the carabao they exercised violence and\u00a0 intimidation\u00a0 against Lozano.\u00a0 The robbery took place at that moment.\u00a0 While Lozano voluntarily left the house with\u00a0 the defendant, leading his carabao, later he was deprived of its possession\u00a0 by violence and intimidation.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant struck Lozano with his bolo, at the same time\u00a0 snatching from his hands the rope with which Lozano was leading his carabao.\u00a0 The defendants by deceit induced the owner of the carabao to take the same from the corral\u00a0 and conduct it\u00a0 in the direction of the municipality, under the plea that it was necessary for him to take\u00a0 his carabao to the\u00a0 municipality.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendants evidently used deceit in the first\u00a0 instance for the purpose of enticing the owner of the carabao to a point where they might more effectively commit the crime of robbery without the fear of apprehension.\u00a0 The defendants made Lozano believe, through their deceit, that it was necessary for him to show his carabao in the municipality.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant represented to Lozano that he and his companions were members of the Constabulary;\u00a0 that they had authority to require him to deliver to them\u00a0 his documents and to\u00a0 take his carabao to the municipality.\u00a0\u00a0 This misrepresentation, it is true, was made more by the manner and conduct of the defendant and his companions than by anything which was said, but it was none the less effective.\u00a0 A people who for a long period have been accustomed to obey implicitly the commands of the official\u00a0 class and\u00a0 to\u00a0 be\u00a0 punished severely for refusing so to do, are very likely to obey even a suggestion of command.\u00a0\u00a0 Of course if Lozano had delivered his carabao\u00a0 without\u00a0 protest or without\u00a0 violence or intimidation, the crime would\u00a0 not have been robbery, but this he did not do.\u00a0 He was willing to obey the orders of the\u00a0 alleged officers of the law\u00a0 and he did this\u00a0 without requiring them to show their authority.\u00a0 It will be noted, however, that\u00a0 he did not deliver to\u00a0 them his carabao.\u00a0 It was taken from him by force and violence.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>The attorney for the appellant, in support of his contention that the acts done did not constitute the crime of robbery, cites a decision of the supreme court of Spain of the 21st of February, 1873, published in the Official Gazette on the 25th of March of the same\u00a0 year.\u00a0 (3 Viada, 340, Question 4.)\u00a0 The question in that case as Viada puts it is as follows:<\/p><blockquote>\"Question IV. - When one demands of another the delivery of a thing, of a horse, for example, offering to give him a receipt therefor, which, after being drawn up, he refuses to sign, and notwithstanding this refusal enters the stable and\u00a0 takes the horse, against the owner's will: which crime does he thereby commit, theft or robbery?\"\u00a0 <\/blockquote><p>The attorney for the appellant evidently did not read all that Viada said with reference to this question, nor note carefully the decision of the supreme court of Spain.\u00a0 The supreme court\u00a0 of Spain held that, under the facts put in said question, the defendant was guilty of the crime of robbery and not of larceny.\u00a0\u00a0 The attorney for the appellant also\u00a0 cites a decision of the supreme\u00a0 court of Spain of the 10th of May, 1879, published in the Official Gazette on the 8th of August of the same year.\u00a0\u00a0 (3 Viada,\u00a0 342, Question 7.)\u00a0\u00a0 The facts\u00a0 in the latter case were stated by Viada as follows:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><blockquote><p> \"Question VII. - Did he who came up to a man who was lying in a public road and who he thought was asleep, though apparently he was\u00a0 not, and with a knife cut off his\u00a0 belt, which contained a small sum of money, a medal and a rosary, and took it away, but was pursued and caught through the outcry raised by the victim, who had previously remained silent from fear, commit the crime of robbery or the crime of theft?\"\u00a0 <\/p><\/blockquote><p> It is true, in this latter case that the supreme court of Spain\u00a0 held that the crime was larceny and not robbery, but a mere casual reading of the facts shows clearly that there was no force or intimidation used.<\/p><p> It is scarcely necessary to discuss the question that in case of robbery there must be force and intimidation.\u00a0 These constitute the very essentials of the crime of robbery.\u00a0\u00a0 Putting one in fear of bodily injury or threats of arrest is suf- ficient\u00a0 to\u00a0 constitute\u00a0 force\u00a0 and intimidation.\u00a0 (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Smith,\u00a0 3 Phil. Rep., 20; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Barot, 15 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 463; U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Osorio, 21 Phil. Rep., 237; U. S. <em>vs<\/em>.\u00a0 Flores, 19 Phil. Rep., 178.)<\/p><p> With reference to the second assignment of error,\u00a0 that the\u00a0 facts\u00a0 are\u00a0 insufficient to show that the defendant\u00a0 is guilty\u00a0 of the crime charged, upon a careful\u00a0 examination of the evidence, we find that the facts stated in\u00a0 the sentence of the lower court are fully sustained and that the defendant and his companions committed the act complained of in the complaint.<\/p><p> With reference to the third assignment of error, to\u00a0 wit: That the lower court committed an error in\u00a0 considering the deceit practiced by the defendant and his companions as an aggravating\u00a0 circumstance, it is sufficient to say, without deciding whether or not deceit in a case of robbery may or may not, under certain circumstances,\u00a0 constitute an aggravating circumstance, we are of the opinion that in the present case it can in no way affect the sentence of the lower court,\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 reason that there existed one aggravating circumstance and\u00a0 no extenuating circumstances, and the penalty must, therefore, be in the maximum degree provided bylaw.<\/p><p> After a full consideration of\u00a0 the evidence\u00a0 and the errors complained of by the appellant, we are of the opinion that the sentence\u00a0 of the\u00a0 lower court should\u00a0 be\u00a0 affirmed,\u00a0 with costs.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<\/p><p><em>Arellano, C.

The complaint alleged that, on August 18, 1903, in the pueblo of Santa Cruz  of the said province, the  plaintiff  Razlag made with the defendant Balantacbo a contract of lease of a lot, described in the instrument, for  a term of ten years, from January 1, 1905, to January 1,  1915, with the right on the part  of the lessee to sublet the said lot to any other person, and that the plaintiff  did sublet it to the provincial treasurer, Mr.  C. H. Lamb,  although this  contract was  canceled and the said lot  was sublet by the  plaintiff to the provincial board  of Laguna,  which last sublease became ineffective on December 31,   1909;  that the  defendant, Balantacbo, without previously rescinding the contract between himself and the plaintiff and having no right to rescind the same, maliciously and unlawfully occupied the said lot, on December 31, and  performed acts of  possession and ownership over the leased property, thereby violating the stipulations of the contract and causing great damage to  the plaintiff, Razlag; and that, therefore, the latter's first cause of action was such noncompliance with the contract.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to the second cause of action, to wit, that relative to an indemnity for loss and damage, each and all of the allegations  set forth as grounds for the first cause of action were reproduced, and it was further alleged:  That the plaintiff, beginning  with the date of the lease of the lot, planted trees thereon, graded, filled, and fenced it, spending in such improvements about ^=8,000; that it was his intention to establish a sanitarium on the said lot, as soon as the acacia, mango, gum,  and rubber trees,  etc., planted in rows, to form avenues for the purposes of shade, recreation, and hygiene  should be sufficiently grown;  that the plaintiff  Razlag, undertook  a voyage from Amoy, China, where he resided, to Santa Cruz, Laguna, with the intention of taking the necessary measures and preparing the plans for  the erection of a sanitarium  on the leased lot, which  was the principal purpose  for which the  lease was executed  between  himself  and the  defendant;  that, with such object in view, he did in fact visit the lot about the 15th of May,  1910, and then found that a number of trees, from six to eight years  old and of  the necessary height and of  sufficient foliage for the  purposes  had in view  by the plaintiff upon his planting them, had  been cut near the ground and torn up by the roots; that forty-one of such trees were dead and their trunks left on the ground, and holes of several meters  in depth and width were  dug; that such damage was done  to  the  plantings and to the surface of the ground that the aspect,  and condition of the lot, as well as the principal object of the lease, were transformed, to the prejudice of the interests of the plaintiff, who had employed considerable money in the planting and grading of the lot; that, for the  reasons stated, it became materially impossible for the plaintiff to build a sanitarium and contract for the erection of a hotel on the said lot, or to lease the latter for the purpose of the construction thereon of any other building for the conduct of any kind of business, for which the site was suitable owing to the fact that it was in front of the provincial government building, the schools and other accessory buildings belonging to the province; that the plaintiff was obliged to find attorneys and sign a contract with  them in order that they might represent and defend him in this  case, and to pay them  the sum of P600,  which  was made an integral part of the damages occasioned to him; that the acts  performed by the defendant caused the plaintiff losses in the sum of \u00a32,000, through the injuries to the lot and trees, and also  damages calculated at  P3,000, a  sum less than what the said lot might have yielded  him; and that, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs  1, 2 and 3 of  section 164 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the plaintiff petitioned for the issuance of a preliminary injunction against the defendant,  his family,  agent, servant and attorneys, restraining them from performing the acts therein specified.<\/p>\n<p>The  plaintiff,  therefore,  asked: (1)  That the said  contract of lease be declared to be subsistent, effective  and in force; (2) that the acts performed by the defendant be held  to be violations of the said contract; (3)  that the plaintiff be declared to be entitled  to an indemnity for losses and damages in the total  sum of P5,600;  and,  (4) that the defendant be sentenced to pay  the costs, and, in a proper case,  his prosecution ordered for the crime of estafa,  if the evidence should so warrant.<\/p>\n<p>The writ of preliminary injunction was issued, under a bond  of P500.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant, in answer to the foregoing complaint, set forth:  That he admitted paragraphs 1, 2,  and  3 thereof, relative to the causes of action for noncompliance with the contract; that he denied generally and  specifically all the other allegations that were not explicitly admitted in the special  defense;  that, for  the  purposes of  the  latter,  he alleged  that all the rights,  actions,  obligations, and  privileges  which  the plaintiff had  in the land  that was  the subject of the contract  of lease between the plaintiff and the defendant, were by the former transferred to the provincial  board  of  Laguna; that the  defendant  treated with the said board in regard to all matters pertaining to the land  herein  concerned, in the  belief that such provincial  board  was, by reason of the transfer aforementioned,  subrogated, had acquired  the  rights of the plaintiff in the lease of the property,  and that the defendant in good faith  so believed and continued to believe; that the plaintiff, by contemporaneous and subsequent acts, had evidenced his  having, transferred  all  his  rights, actions, obligations, and privileges in the land in, question, for the reason that, since he made the said transfer, he had had no dealings .whatsoever with the defendant concerning such land; and the defendant, in turn, believing that the plaintiff lessee was no longer in any manner concerned  in the land in question, likewise dealt no further with the plaintiff in regard thereto, but with the provincial board, from whom he directly collected the rent; that, by virtue of the letter dated December 18, 1909, which  the defendant received from the provincial treasurer, an official  who, in representation of the provincial board, acquired all the rights, obligations, and privileges derived from the transfer  made by the first to the  second party just above  mentioned, the defendant took possession  of  the  said land, an act that rescinded the contract  of lease, performed by consent of the parties under clause 4 of the original contract of lease; that the improvements, consisting  of acacia trees planted on the  land by the plaintiff,  were sold  to the provincial board by the plaintiff, upon his effecting the said transfer of his rights, obligations, and privileges; and that the plaintiff violated the terms  of  the  contract by  planting acacia trees on the said land, thus rendering the same useless for other plantings.<\/p>\n<p>In counterclaim the defendant alleged  that the plaintiff, Razlag, ordered the bamboo, which was growing on the land, to be cut and did not give to the defendant the part thereof which belonged to him; and that,  in accordance with  an amendment requested by the defendant, on account of the violation of the said contract on the part of the plaintiff and by reason of the issuance of the writ of prohibition, losses and damages were occasioned to the defendant, Balantacbo, in the amount of \u00a3=1,000; the latter, therefore, prayed that he be absolved  from the complaint and that Adolfo Razlag, the  defendant in the cross  complaint, be sentenced to pay the  sum of P1,000, the amount of the losses and damages occasioned by the violation of the contract of lease, and that said contract be declared rescinded.<\/p>\n<p>After the hearing, and the introduction of testimony by both parties, the exhibits being attached to the record, the court, on March 24, 1911, rendered judgment holding that the  contract of  lease of the lot in question  should subsist until the lapse of the term stipulated by the parties thereto, and absolving the defendant, Sancho Balantacbo, from the demand made by the plaintiff  for an  indemnity for losses and damages. The counterclaim presented by the defendant was disallowed, and the costs were assessed against the plaintiff.  From this judgment counsel for the plaintiff excepted  and, by  a  written motion,  asked for a rehearing, which was denied; exception was taken to the ruling and, the  proper  bill  of  exceptions  having  been presented, the same was certified, approved and forwarded, together with the exhibits and a transcript of the evidence, to the clerk of this court.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the plaintiff demands an indemnity for losses and  damages on account of the defendant's alleged violation of the terms of the contract of lease executed on August 21, 1901, and amended on the  18th of the same month of 1903.<\/p>\n<p>The lessee, now the plaintiff, availing himself of the right accorded him in the said contract, sublet the  land,  the subject  of that instrument, to the provincial government of Laguna, according to the notarial document executed by and between the lessee  and the provincial treasurer  of  Laguna, on July 20, 1907.  It was stipulated in this last sublease that the provincial government of Laguna should pay  to the lessee, Adolfo Razlag, in a single payment, the sum of P200 as  complete satisfaction for the expenses incurred by Razlag in the embellishment of the land sublet, and  thereby the  government, the sublessee, acquired, from the date of the sublease, all the rights, actions, privileges and obligations which Razlag had and could have with respect to the said land by virtue of the contract of lease between him and the owner of the same, Sancho Balantacbo, in accordance with the instruments executed on August 21, 1901, and August 18, 1903.  This  sublease between  the plaintiff and  the provincial government was to continue until the  expiration of the original  lease aforementioned, though  the latter retained the right to terminate such sublease at will.<\/p>\n<p>The existence of these contracts of lease and  sublease of the land in question being premised,  the first question that arises is  whether the first or  original  contract of lease, which went into  effect on  January 1, 1905, and should expire on the same day  of the month of January, 1915, still subsists.<\/p>\n<p>A  letter addressed  to  the owner of the  land, Sancho Balantacbo, by the provincial treasurer of Laguna, Exhibit No. 1, states that, whereas by reason of the payment made by the provincial board to Dr.  Adolfo Razlag for the improvements made by the latter on the land  in question, all the rights and actions of the lessee under the original contract of lease were transferred to the province, the rescission of the contract of sublease, decided upon by the provincial board, would be considered as rescinding the said original contract.  Nevertheless, as the defendant acquiesced in the judgment of the lower court, which  held that the aforementioned contract  of lease should  subsist until the  expiration of the term of ten years  fixed by the parties thereto, counting from the 1st of January, 1905, it is not possible to discuss this point, to wit, whether the contract of lease still exists or not, for it was decided affirmatively by the trial judge, and the defendant owner of the  land has accepted that decision.<\/p>\n<p>There alone remains to  be determined whether the lessee Razlag  still holds a right in  the improvements which he made on the leased land, after  having conveyed  such improwments to the provincial board of Laguna, together with all his rights, actions and privileges derived from the contract of lease, and collected the sum of P200 as a consideration for such conveyance.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff, Razlag, by the said  conveyance of all his rights and privileges in the improvements made on  the leased land, transferred all his rights to the provincial board in exchange for the said sum; it is, therefore, unquestionable that he has no right whatever in the said improvements, and if afterwards the said board saw fit to rescind the contract of sublease, in accordance with the stipulations made, and to return the land to its owner,  when nearly all  the improvements sold to the sublessee had already ceased to exist, it would neither be reasonable, just nor lawful to sentence such  owner who received the  return pf his property, not from the original lessee, but from the sublessee, to pay an indemnity for losses and damages to the plaintiff, who ceased to be the owner of the said improvements, the destruction of which,  the  plaintiff claims, constitutes the  losses and damages in question.   The provincial board, the transferee of the improvements, would alone be  entitled to  demand such an indemnity, if losses and damages there really were. The original contract provided,  among other things, that the lessee might erect a building on the leased land and execute other works, provided  he paid a rental of 100 pesos Mexican currency at the end of each year counting from the day  when the sanitarium that Razlag intended to build, should be opened  to  the public; and  in the instrument amending the said original contract it was further stipulated that Razlag should be liable for the payment of all land taxes levied upon the leased lot, and that the latter should be at his free disposal with the right on his part to sublet the same to any person, without being required to erect thereon the said sanitarium.   So that the lessee, Razlag, must have abandoned his chief purpose, since,  on Juty 20, 1907, or four years after the  amendment or modification  of the original contract, the  plaintiff sublet the land to the provincial government of Laguna, converted his interests into cash and abandoned  this country to reside in Amoy, China, and it was set forth in the notarial instru* ment, executed by the contracting parties for the purpose of the sublease just above indicated, that the said provincial government should pay  to  the sublessor, Razlag, in one single payment, the, sum of P200 Philippine  currency, in full satisfaction of the expenses incurred by the said sublessor in the embellishment  of the land;  that the sublessee should pay to the sublessor  a rental of \u00a3100 at the end of each year, beginning with January 1, 1907, until the expiration  of the contract, which should expire on  the date of the termination of the original contract between Razlag and the owner of the land; that, from the date of the sublease, the government of the province, as sublessee, should acquire all the rights, actions, privileges, and obligations which the plaintiff Razlag, the sublessor, had or might have over the  land in question by reason  of the original contract of lease  between himself and the owner or proprietor of the land, Sancho Balantacbo, but that the sublease should become  inoperative and  have  no further force and effect whenever its  annulment should be desired  and demanded by the provincial government of Laguna.<\/p>\n<p>By resolution of the provincial board  of December 13, 1909, adopted in view of the fact that there were no longer any carabaos to be herded on the said land, which had been used as  a corral and  for various  other purposes of the provincial government, and in  obedience to  measures of economy made necessary by the financial condition of the province, the  said board saw fit to  provide that the aforementioned contract of lease of the land in question should be rescinded on the 31st of December, 1909, and the resolution  Was communicated  to  the sublessor, Adolfo Razlag. By an  official letter of the 18th of December of the same year, 1909, the provincial treasurer also apprised the owner of the land that the contract of sublease would be rescinded on the aforementioned date  of December 31; in this letter notice was given that, in consideration of the payment made by the province to Doctor  Razlag for the improvements effected by him on the land in question, the said Razlag had conveyed to the provincial board all his rights and actions under the  original contract of lease,  and that,  therefore, the rescission of the contract of sublease  should be considered as the rescission of the said original contract.<\/p>\n<p>The said land was converted into a stock corral by order of the  sublessee,  then  used for horses  belonging  to. the Army, and afterwards  placed  by the provincial board at the disposal of the teachers for the use of the school children as a playground, so it is impossible that the trees planted by the plaintiff, Razlag, and the improvements made on the said land, could have been maintained intact, since,  as a result of the sublease to the provincial board the property was  put to the different uses  aforementioned, uses which are far from being such as would make for the conservation of improved grounds.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover; it is proved by the record that the government of the province, as well  as the municipal president, ordered the removal of several acacia trees planted on the land and transplanted  them in different places  in the town,  and if afterwards the defendant owner of the land exercised acts of ownership upon the property after it had been returned to him by the provincial board with the official letter, Exhibit  1  (in  which the  provincial treasurer informed him that the contract of sublease would be rescinded on December 31, 1909, and that all the rights and actions  under the original contract of lease had been transferred to the province in consideration of  the payment made by the provincial board to the sublessor, Razlag,  for the improvements made by the latter on the land in litigation, and that the original contract  was considered rescinded by the rescission  of the contract  of sublease), it can not be held that the owner of the land resumed possession in bad faith, knowing that Razlag, then absent from these Islands and in China, had not returned to that province  to take any steps  whatever in defense of any rights he possessed in the  disputed land, after the lapse of more than four years of abandonment and when, at his  own  suggestion  and with his consent, the provincial government, from the beginning of the sublease, treated directly with the defendant, the owner of the property, in all matters relative thereto  and paid to him  the stipulated rentals.<\/p>\n<p>He who gives  up and conveys his  rights in a parcel of leased land, to a sublessee for the sum of P200 paid to him by the latter for  the improvements made thereon, may  not afterwards demand an indemnity for losses and  damages from the owner of the property, for the disappearance of the said improvements which ceased to belong to him who made such renunciation.<\/p>\n<p>If the plaintiff believed that, notwithstanding such conveyance or sale, he still held any right in the improvements or embellishments of the said land, he should also have filed claim against the provincial board, after he was informed by the  latter of  its resolution to rescind  the contract  of sublease and to deliver the land to  its legitimate owner, pursuant to the stipulations contained in  the contract  of sublease.<\/p>\n<p>It is not credible that improvements on land were maintained  after it  had  been  converted into a corral and subsequently into a playground; and  if, therefore, the improvements and embellishments of the land disappeared, it was  not by the defendant's fault, but through that  of  the plaintiff who sublet it to the provincial board which needed it for a  carabao corral and for other purposes very different from those stated by the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, it must be borne in mind that it  does not follow as a logical consequence from the statement made by the court in  the judgment appealed from,  that  losses and damages were occasioned to the plaintiff and that an  indemnity therefor, claimed by him, should be awarded,  unless it should appear  satisfactorily  proven that the  defendant failed to comply  with  his obligations  toward  the plaintiff and that it was by the former's fault that the latter suffered such losses and damages.<\/p>\n<p>Article 1101 of the Civil Code prescribes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Those who in fulfilling their obligations are guilty of fraud, negligence, or delay, arid those who in  any mariner whatsoever act in contravention of the stipulations of the same, shall  be subject to indemnity for the  losses and damages caused thereby.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It is not shown to have been duly proven in this case that the defendant, in performing the  obligations arising from the said contract of lease, acted fraudulently, negligently or caused delay, or that he in any  manner failed to comply with the terms of the contract; and, therefore, there exists no legal or just reason to oblige the  defendant  to pay the indemnity demanded.<\/p>\n<p>With  respect to the first assignment of error, the appellant must understand that, the original contract having been declared to subsist, the injunction is to be considered as maintained, for the reason that the owner of the property is obliged to respect the decision  of the court,  unless the tenant should  violate the said contract and give  rise to ejectment  proceedings.  If ejectment be decreed  by the court, the injunction will be dissolved,  even without express judicial declaration to such effect.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from have been refuted, it is our opinion that  the latter must be, and it is hereby, affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

HACHAW, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.\n  <br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"><p>The defendant in  this case was  convicted of the crime of having: opium in his possession without authority of law. His appeal is based  solely upon  the  proposition  that the evidence is not sufficient  to support  the conviction.<\/p>\n<p>The conviction is based upon the evidence of three witnesses  of  the prosecution, namely, Jose Mendoza, Alejo Hilario, and Antonio Aquino.  They assert in substance that while they were on a certain street iri the town of Cavite they noticed  the accused, a Chinaman,  who  was  passing along the street, acting very suspiciously.  They called  to him to stop,  but, instead of doing so, he  started  to  run. They  thereupon pursued and overtook him and c\u00a7mpelled him to go  with them to the presidencies  Arriving there they compelled him to take everything out of  his pockets. Among the things  brought forth was, they claim,  a small quantity of opium done up in paper.<\/p>\n<p>The accused denies  absolutely  the story told by these witnesses.  He asserts that he never used opium in  any way;  that  he did not deal in  the  drug; that  at the time of his arrest he had  no opium  in his possession;  that the opium, if any, found on him in the presidencia was placed in his pocket by the witnesses above named and then taken therefrom on the search.  In support of this story he presented the testimony of three persons, members of the Constabulary, one a sergeant, another a corporal, and the third a private.  They were at the time dressed in civilian clothes and were engaged under the orders of their officers in making a quiet search for criminals in that locality.  They assert that while  standing  upon  the  street  on which the accused was arrested Jose Mendoza came to them and asked them if they did not want to make  some money; that they asked him in what way he. proposed  that the money should  be made; that he replied that he had some opium and that they should take it and put it in the pocket of some Chinaman, whereupon he would arrest the Chinaman; that in all probability the Chinaman would thereupon try to bribe them and then would  come their opportunity to make the money; that he showed them the  opium and  the paper  in which it  was wrapped.   These  witnesses further  assert that after they had rejected the proposition Mendoza took the opium and put it in his pocket.  They stood there together for a short time afterwards, when they saw a policeman, Ale jo Hilario, coming down the street.  Mendoza ordered Hilario to arrest the accused,  alleging as a reason therefor that  he might show some \"forbidden thing\" in his possession.  When the accused came along Mendoza ordered Hilario to stop him, which he did.  Thereupon  Mendoza approached the accused, took from  his pocket the  opium he had previously shown the witnesses and surreptitiously inserted it in the pocket of the accused.  These witnesses testified that they followed Mendoza and his companions when they took the accused to the  presidencia.   They saw the accused  when  he  was searched and saw the opium when it was produced at that time.  They declared unhesitatingly that the opium was the same that  had been shown them  by Mendoza  and  was wrapped in the identical paper in which it was then  inclosed. While  the  witnesses for  the  prosecution assert  that the Chinaman thereupon offered them three 20-peso bills if they would let him go and say nothing about  his possession of the opium, the Constabulary soldiers testified that no such thing happened.<\/p>\n<p>Mendoza does not deny that he was on the street at the place and time  alleged by the Constabulary soldiers and admits that they were also present at the presidencia when the Chinaman was searched.   He does not directly deny the story told by the Constabulary soldiers.   The denial results by inference from the contradictory stories told by the two sets of witnesses.<\/p>\n<p>The trial court  based its rejection of the testimony of the Constabulary soldiers upon the ground that it was unreasonable that Mendoza should have tried to induce them to enter into a conspiracy to defraud the Chinaman, asserting that if Mendoza had thought of doing any  such thing he would have kept it to himself instead of inviting others to participate with him.  This is correct  without doubt to a certain extent, but we do not regard it as controlling.  If Mendoza had carried out the scheme according to the theory of the trial court, while he would not have exposed himself to the mercy of the Constabulary soldiers, he would,  nevertheless, have been met with the proposition on the trial that he had placed the opium in the pocket of the accused, and he would have had his testimony alone agairst the testimony of the Chinaman; whereas, if he had succeeded  in inducing the Constabulary soldiers to enter the conspiracy with him, his testimony  against the Chinaman would have  been supported by that of three other persons.  From the record, we regard the story told by the Constabulary soldiers fully as reasonable as  that told by Mendoza.<\/p>\n<p>Mendoza presents as the only reason why he  ordered the arrest of the Chinaman that he was acting suspiciously.  He did not say in what way he was acting suspiciously or what was the particular  act or circumstance which aroused his curiosity.   He said in that connection:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I told Alejo Hilario I had  suspicions of the Chinaman. I had suspicions that he had some prohibited thing which he carried on his person.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>When asked to tell what prohibited thing1 he suspected, he said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"There are  many  things which are prohibited which might be used to assault a person with, or a pointed instrument which might be used to strike with or with which a crime might be done against the government or robbery in some house, or opium on his person.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In another place he said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I just said to Ale jo Hilario that I had suspicions of this Chinaman, without saying what my suspicions were.\"'<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Further on he said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Yes,  I followed along behind Hilario and  the  accused to the police station.  I wanted  to see if he had committed a  crime  *   *  *.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This testimony of the  witness does not present any clear reason why he arrested the Chinaman. He arrested him because, as he said, \"I wanted to see if he had committed a crime.\"  Among free men and under constitutional and statutory guaranties of personal liberty, this furnishes no reason whatever why a person  should be arrested.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that the testimony of these three witnesses for the defendant, given as it is by persons whose reputation\" is apparently good  and whose allegations have not been discredited  in any way, is strong evidence in the case and sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. The trial court itself in no way impeached the credibility of those witnesses  except to say that  their story was  unreasonable.  We do not believe it to be so unreasonable that it  ought to be rejected entirely.  We regard it as reasonable as the story told by Mendoza and as likely to have been  the true history of the occurrence as  that given by the witnesses for the prosecution.<\/p>\n<p>For these reasons the judgment of conviction is reversed and the defendant acquitted.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

I., did willfully, unlawfully and criminally, and for the sake of gain, take possession of 4,500 bundles of <i>zacate<\/i>, valued at P8.50, the property of Tomas Sandoval, Miguel Pagkalinawan, Valentin Cruz, Antonio Cruz&gt; Jose Pagtakhan, Ciriaco Bonifacio, Juanita Clemente, Lucio Espiritu, Demetrio Dumagat, and Hugo Cruz, using violence and intimidation against persons and employing force upon things: an act committed in violation of law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>During the trial of the cause, the prosecuting attorney asked that the complaint against the defendants, Isidoro Santos, Jose S. Pedro, Rufino Mamonong, and Fermin Dionisio be dismissed, and that they be discharged from the custody of the law, for the reason that there was not sufficient proof to sustain the charge against them; which petition was granted by the lower court and the case proceeded against the defendant Silverio Mamonong.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable Simplicio del Rosario, judge, found the defendant guilty of the crime of robbery, under article 502 of the Penal Code, and because of the fact that the property stolen did not exceed in value 65 pesetas, the penalty imposed was that provided for under article 513 of said code.<br\/><br\/>The lower court found that there were no modifying circumstances attending the commission of the crime, and imposed upon the defendant the penalty of three months and eleven days of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>, together with the restitution of the sum of P8.50 to Mariano Clemente, and to pay one-fifth part of the costs.<br\/><br\/>From that sentence the defendant appealed to this court. In this court the contention made by the defendant and appellant, is that the proof adduced during the trial of the cause was not sufficient to show that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged.<br\/><br\/>During the trial of the cause the prosecuting attorney attempted to show that the defendant was cutting and carrying away <i>zacate<\/i> of spontaneous growth, from the lands of one Silvestre Espiritu. The lands upon which said <i>zacate<\/i> was cut were not very clearly defined by the testimony. The defendant claims that the place where he was cutting the <i>zacate<\/i> was not on lands belonging to the said Espiritu. The defendant presented several witnesses, among whom was one Graciano Uta, who swore positively that the lands upon which the defendant was cutting <i>zacate<\/i> belonged to him and that he had given the defendant such permission.<br\/><br\/>We have then the declaration of Silvestre Espiritu, who swore that the lands upon which the defendant was cutting <i>zacate<\/i> belonged to him and the just as positive declaration, under oath, of Graciano Uta that the lands in question belonged to him. No maps or plans were presented showing the limits of the respective parcels of land claimed by Espiritu and Uta.<br\/><br\/>Moreover the complaint charges that the <i>zacate<\/i> stolen was the property of Tomaa Sandoval, Miguel Pagkalinawan, Valentin Cruz, Antonio Cruz, Jose Pagtakhan, Ciriaco Bonifacio, Juanita Clemente, Lucio Espiritu, Demetrio Dumagat, and Hugo Cruz. During the trial there was not a word of testimony offered that these persons were the owners of the <i>zacate<\/i> in question. The proof related solely to the ownership of the land upon which the <i>zacate<\/i> of spontaneous growth was cut. Without discussing the question whether or not the crime of robbery may be committed by cutting <i>zacate<\/i> of spontaneous growth, we are of the opinion that, in view of the contradictory statements with reference to the identity of the lands upon which the <i>zacate<\/i> was cut, the recommendation of the Attorney-General that the decision of the lower court be reversed, the complaint be dismissed and the defendant discharged from the custody of the law, should be accepted, for the reason that the proof is not sufficiently clear and positive to show the guilt of the defendant, beyond a reasonable doubt.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, it is hereby ordered that sentence of the lower court be reversed, the complaint be dismissed, and the defendant discharged from the custody of the law, with costs <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.
