and to this effect she testified under oath before the said officer and recounted the particulars of said robbery in Tagalog, because she was unable to speak Spanish.\u00a0 Her testimony was translated into Spanish by the fiscal himself and typewritten by Lucio Velasquez, a copyist to whom it was dictated while the exponent was testifying.\u00a0 At the termination of the testimony the copyist read it to Valeria de Chaves in Tagalog, and as the latter found it correct she put a cross between her name and surname.<br\/><br\/>It was stated in the testimony that on the night in question the complainant had seen the three accused steal from her house, situated\u00a0 in the town of San Jose, Batangas, a trunk that belonged to her and which contained jewelry and money, and that she offered no opposition nor uttered any cries because one of the thieves threatened to kill her with the bolo that he carried if she called out for help.\u00a0 However, at the trial of the case on the 5th of January, 1909, Valeria de Chaves in her testimony stated that on the said night she did not see any of the accused commit the robbery, but that it was her daughter, a girl about 6 to 7 years old, who awoke her and informed her that the three accused persons had stolen the said trunk, and that one of them had threatened her with a bolo if she cried out.<br\/><br\/>A complaint was therefore presented by the provincial fiscal on the 5th of January, charging Valeria de Chaves with committing the crime of perjury, in violation of section 3 of Act No. 1697.\u00a0 Proceedings were instituted, and the trial judge sentenced her, on the 16th of January last, to the penalty of one year's imprisonment and a fine of P100, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and costs.\u00a0 From this judgment the representative of the accused has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The matter involved herein is the crime of perjury dealt with in Act No. 1697, section 3 of which provides that\u2014<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Any person who, having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the Philippine Islands authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury, and shall be punished by a fine of not more than two thousand pesos and by imprisonment for riot more than five years; and shall, moreover, thereafter be incapable of holding any public office or of giving testimony in any court of the Philippine Islands until such time as the judgment against him is reversed.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The accused, Valeria de Chaves, declared under oath before the provincial fiscal of Batangas that she was robbed late at night on the 27th of February, 1908, and in spite of the fact that, according to the complaint, the informant when testifying in the case instituted for said crime contradicted her previous declaration and denied that she had seen the thieves at the time of the stealing of the trunk containing money and jewelry, as was stated by the fiscal in the record of the investigation held at his office, and alleged that it was her daughter of 6 or 7 years of age who woke up and witnessed the robbery and was threatened by one of the robbers, and the one who, after the robbers were gone, called her and informed her of what had occurred, giving her the names of persons involved; it is nevertheless true and unquestionable that the said crime of attempt against the property was committed, for which reason it can not be held that a criminal act was falsely imputed to a third person or persons that did not take place, because the robbery was committed and the injured parties have not recovered the money and jewels which the robbers took away, notwithstanding the fact that one of them, Marcelo Remo, promised to return them in consequence of the efforts made by the husband of the accused.\u00a0 The crime of perjury is alleged to have been committed because of the declaration\u00a0 and subsequent denial that Valeria de Chaves had witnessed the act of robbery, as affirmed by her before the fiscal of Batangas.<br\/><br\/>There is no satisfactory proof in the record that the accused knowingly and intentionally testified in the case anything that she believed to be in violation of her oath when she declared before the said fiscal of Batangas, inasmuch as she averred that she was the victim of a robbery, which is true and incontrovertible.\u00a0 If in her subsequent declaration she stated that she had not seen the thieves and only became aware of the fact by the information she received from her daughter who recognized them and witnessed the robbery, upon which last statement she strenuously insisted, it is to be presumed that because she did not understand Spanish, or through error or by misunderstanding the questions put to her, the accused said that she had seen the robbery herself and knew of it from her own knowledge; it did not occur to her to state that she was informed by her daughter who was an eyewitness of the robbery.<br\/><br\/>The accused being the person who suffered by reason of the said robbery, in insistently affirming in her declaration in connection with said crime that, when her daughter woke her, the thieves were no longer in the house, her statement must have been her true and conscientious opinion, and no reason appears that might have induced\u00a0 her to change her first declaration before the fiscal; it must therefore be assumed that she made the statement by mistake, owing to her ignorance of the Spanish language, and to the fact that she did not fully understand the questions put to her.<br\/><br\/>A mere contradiction, not of the principal fact, which in this case is the robbery, but with respect to certain details of more or less importance, is not necessarily indicative of falsehood in the declarations of Valeria de Chaves, because, in view of their tenor and the lack of proof that there was an intent to pervert the truth, it is not possible to state in which of the two declarations the error or inexactitude occurred, or whether it was committed voluntarily or involuntarily; in view of the doubt, it is proper to hold that she stated the truth before the trial court and the error or mistake was committed when she testified before the fiscal.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, and because of the lack of proof of the crime of perjury, punished by the aforesaid Act, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed and the accused Valeria de Chaves acquitted, and we hereby acquit her with the costs of both instances <i>de oficio<\/i>.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<\/div>",

Miguel Pascual filed with the Court of Land Registration an application for the registration, pursuant to the provisions of the Land Registration Act, of a piece of land belonging exclusively to him.\u00a0 Said land consists of four parcels, was inscribed in the old registry, and is located in the barrio of San Roque, within the municipality of Navotas; it is bounded on the north by lands belonging to Producio Suarez, Brigida Tengco, Saturnina Bunda, Macario Angeles, and Damaso Oliveros; on the east by the Navotas River; on the south by property of Faustino Pascual, and on the west by the Manila Bay, as will be seen on the map accompanying said petition and submitted as Exhibit A.\u00a0 That part of the land in question which is classed as city property has an area of 18,474 square meters and 55 square decimeters, while that part classed as rural property measures 34,164 square meters and 75 square decimeters.\u00a0 A dwelling house and a storehouse of strong materials and corrugated iron roof, the property of the petitioner, are erected thereon.\u00a0 According to the application the said four parcels of land composing the property above mentioned, inscribed in the old registry as already said, and having the foregoing limits, were acquired by the applicant as heir of his mother Crisanta Gonzalez, as appears from Exhibit B which is a certificate issued by the register of deeds of this city.\u00a0 For the purposes of the payment of the land tax the four parcels in question were assessed jointly in the sum of P4,520, as shown by Exhibit C.\u00a0 Said property is free from all incumbrances and, so far as petitioner is aware, no person claims any right or interest in said land except Alejandro Santos, Quiteria Florindo, Marcos Naval, Andrea Soriano, Pedro Pascual, Teodoro Pascual, Felipe Pascual, Angelo Pascual, Miguel Sia\u00f1o, Marcelo Jiongco, Graciano Alcantara, Pantaleon Bautista, Laureana Gonzalez, Aniceto Santos, Quintin Naval, Esperanza Naval, Fausto Perez, Carlota Naval, Alejandro Senson, Damaso Oliveros and Macario Angeles, all residents of said barrio and pueblo.\u00a0 These persons claim a right or interest in the portion of land occupied by each of them within the property above described, mention being made of the names of the tenants of the part of the land classed as city property as well of the lessees on shares of the part of the land classed as rural property.<br\/><br\/>At the hearing of this application, Marcelo Jiongco, by his writing of March 12, 1907, appeared and entered a general and specific denial of all and every one of the facts alleged in the application, and by way of special defense he set forth:\u00a0 that there is pending before the Court of First Instance of Rizal civil case No. 210 brought by the same Miguel Pascual, petitioner, against the respondent Marcelo Jiongco and others, concerning the ownership of the land in question; that by another action, No. 99, before the same court and between the applicant and the objector as parties litigant, the issue in regard to the possession of this same land was decided by the court in favor of the present objector; that within parcel B, as seen on map A, he owns a lot with a house erected thereon, the boundaries of which are, on the north, the Calle Real of Navotas; on the south, cultivated land, on the east, the lands of Miguel and Agustin Sianguio and Graciano Alcantara, and on the west, the lands of Angelo Angeles and Pedro Burgos; its area being 2,318.70 square meters; that he and his predecessors in interest have held the land as owners for a period of more than fifty years, possessing the same peacefully, quietly, and publicly; that he had never known the applicant as owner of the said land, nor asked his permission to build and erect a house nor to sow the land, for which reason he prayed the court to deny said application, and in case it be granted by the court, that a provision be inserted in the decree excluding the parcel of land the subject of his opposition, with the costs against the applicant.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>Opposition was also filed by Macario Angeles, who, by his writing of the same date, entered a general and specific denial of all and every one of the facts set forth in the application, and by way of special defense stated that between the applicant and himself there is pending before the Court of First Instance of Rizal civil case No. 211 for recovery of possession, the land which is the subject of his opposition being also in controversy in said case; that in that part of the land indicated on the map by the letter A, in the direction of the bay, the objector has a parcel of 1,623 square meters, with a house and a storehouse erected thereon, its boundaries being, on the north, the property of Damaso Oliveros; on the south, that of Gil Pascual; on the east, the field indicated in green ink, and on the west, the shore of Manila Bay; that the applicant obtained possession of a strip of this land, measuring 15 <i>varas<\/i> in length and 15<i> varas<\/i> in width on the side bounded by the property of Gil Pascual, through ejectment proceedings instituted in said court, for which reason his opposition will not affect said strip of land; that the objector has been in quiet and peaceful possession, as owner of the parcel which is the subject of his opposition for a period of over thirty years; that he had never regarded the applicant as owner of the land, because, in former times, said property was shore land which by his work he converted into land fit for cultivation and building purposes and on which he has planted for a long time past trees such as mangoes, <i>lomboy<\/i>, tamarind (<i>sampaloc<\/i>), <i>casuy<\/i>, almond, <i>camanchile<\/i>, guava, cane, etc.; for which reason he prayed the court to deny the application, and in case it be granted, that a provision be inserted in the decree of the court excluding therefrom the parcel which is the subject of his opposition, with the costs against the applicant.<br\/><br\/>After the trial, and in view of the evidence submitted by both sides, and the documents presented having been made part of the record, the court, on April 30, 1908, rendered judgment in said case dismissing the oppositions filed by Marcelo Jiongco and Macario Angeles, concerning the respective parcels of land mentioned by them, and an order of default having been previously made against any other objector, the court decreed the adjudication and registration of the parcels in question in favor of the applicant Miguel Pascual.\u00a0 The objectors, Jiongco and Angeles, filed an exception to said decree and also moved for the reopening and rehearing of the case on the ground that the findings of fact of said judgment are openly and plainly contrary to the weight of the evidence, and because the judgment is not supported by the evidence and is contrary to law.\u00a0 The court, by an order dated May 15, 1908, denied said motion, to which they excepted, wherefore the corresponding bills of exceptions, duly approved, were forwarded to the office of the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>This is an application for the registration of property originally consisting of four parcels of land, of which two small ones are devoted to building and residential purposes, and the other two, of much greater area, are used as fields for plantation purposes.\u00a0 Said four parcels were inscribed under different numbers in the old registry of property.<br\/><br\/>The opposition filed by the Attorney-General to the registration of the agricultural parcels of land was afterwards withdrawn in view of the data obtained by the Government and the outcome of the case and because the Government had no interest in said two parcels of agricultural land.<br\/><br\/>Let us now consider the opposition entered by Marcelo Jiongco and Macario Angeles, the former alleging possession of a lot and a building thereon erected within parcel \"B\" and the latter claiming possession of another lot within parcel C, as appears on the map, Exhibit \"A,\"<br\/><br\/>The possession as owner for a period of over fifty years, which includes the time of the possession of his predecessors in interest, which Jiongco alleges to have over a land of 2,318.70 square meters, is by no means supported by the evidence.\u00a0 His alleged right of ownership and possession of the land does not appear from the text of the judgment of September 12, 1903, a certified copy of which forms part of the record of this case.\u00a0 Said judgment was rendered by the judge of the Fifth Judicial District in action No. 99 commenced by the applicant Pascual against the objector Jiongco for the recovery of possession, and held that the plaintiff therein was not entitled to the recovery of possession of the land occupied by the defendant, and located in the sitio of Uaua in the pueblo of Navotas, Province of Rizal.\u00a0 The defendant Jiongco was absolved from the complaint inasmuch as, the judgment says, it has not been established that Miguel Pascual had succeeded his sister Ciriaca Pascual in the rights and actions of the latter, in whose behalf the plaintiff entered into a lease contract with defendant Jiongco, and because it does not appear that the defendant, who is regarded as the lessee, has acknowledged the plaintiff as the lessor by virtue of said contract, and moreover it has not been proved that the land in question formed part of the estate left to him by Ciriaca Pascual.<br\/><br\/>It is an indisputable fact that Marcelo Jiongco has been in the possession of the lot which is the subject of the opposition filed by him, by virtue of a lease contract entered into on January 2,1886, between himself and the applicant, the latter in his capacity of attorney-in-fact of said Ciriaca Pascual.\u00a0 This contract was drafted in Tagalog and signed by said objector, the attorney-in-fact of the landowner, and two witnesses.\u00a0 He can not, therefore, be regarded as owner, and his acts, as possessor, performed in his capacity of mere tenant and by permission of the lessor and pursuant to the stipulations of the contract will not help him to establish his possession.\u00a0 (Art. 1942, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The applicant, Miguel Pascual, is the absolute owner of the four parcels of land in question now constituting a single property, they having been acquired by him as heir of his mother Crisanta Gonzalez, as appears from the documents he submitted, and for this reason, as the right of ownership of the land in question, alleged by the objector, has not been established, there is no legal ground to deny the registration prayed for.<br\/><br\/>The objector Jiongco, having signed the contract for the lease of said lot, can not now, without repudiating his own acts, deny in an action the rights of the applicant, nor impugn the lawfulness and reality of the contract by virtue of which he, as a mere lessee, has been occupying said land.<br\/><br\/>Touching the parcel which is the subject of his opposition, as forming part of lot B, its identity appears fully proven in the record not only by the contract of lease but by paragraph 2 of his own writing of opposition, in which it is stated that the above-mentioned parcel was at issue in the action brought before the Court of First Instance of Rizal, so that in denying that the parcel of land belonged to the applicant, and by averring that he had possessed the same as owner for over fifty years, it becomes clear that both parties agree as to the fact that the parcel claimed by the objector as his own is the same one which he is occupying as lessee and forms part of parcel B, and besides the other larger parcels, is owned solely by the applicant.<br\/><br\/>The opposition of Macario Angeles is chiefly based on the contention that the parcel of 1,623 square meters which he possesses as owner, was formerly shore land, and through his labor he has converted it into profitable soil; the land, however, was sandy, and the sea water in high tide inundated more than one-third of the ground and at times totally covered it.\u00a0 He alleges that the decree of the court ordering the registration of the land in question is contrary to the Law of Ports of May, 1880, because the lands within the maritime zone are of public domain and use, and the accessions and other enlargments of said zone are also of public domain, and that article 366 of the Civil Code concerning the accretions which owners of banks of rivers may receive, is not applicable to the parcel of the objector, which is on the seashore.<br\/><br\/>It is fully established by the records that the land which is the subject of the opposition filed by Macario Angeles forms part of parcel C, the sole property of the applicant, as is proven by the documents submitted by the latter.\u00a0 By the decision of this court in the ejectment proceedings instituted in the Court of First Instance of Rizal by the applicant Pascual against the objector Angeles, it was held that the defendant had likewise been in the possession of said land by virtue of a lease contract, wherefore, notwithstanding his unproven allegation that he was the owner thereof for a period of over thirty years, this court affirmed the action of the lower court and ordered that he be ejected from the land seized by him, and to pay the rents due and the costs.\u00a0 In executing the judgment rendered, therefor the land was not totally released, for there were left thereon a storehouse and a small dwelling house of the defendant, the objector herein, for which reason the applicant Pascual protested at once against such partial execution of the judgment.<br\/><br\/>Deducting from the parcel of land in question a strip of land 15 <i>varas<\/i> square, which Angeles himself acknowledges as belonging to the applicant, the former contends that the remainder of the land belongs to him in spite of the fact that it is included in parcel C which, as indicated above, is owned solely by the applicant.\u00a0 The objector, however, failed to prove his right of dominion thereon, or at least his possession as owner over the remainder of said land; he, by a final judgment, has been classed as a mere tenant who has been occupying the land by permission of the owner and by virtue of a contract, and he has not presented better evidence than that which he submitted in the former proceedings for ejectment.<br\/><br\/>The fact that the land is sandy and that at high tide it is more or less covered by the sea water does not show that the land in question is not the property of the applicant, nor that it belongs to the maritime zone or that it was formed by accession or accretion.\u00a0 The registration thereof was decreed by the court, in spite of the untenable opposition of Angeles, because the right of the applicant is fully supported by the evidence.\u00a0 No provision of the Law of Ports of May 7, 1880, has been violated, because said law has not been made applicable to these Islands, nor of the Law of Waters of August 3, 1866, because it has no bearing on this case, much less of article 366 of the Civil Code which deals with accessions of lands situated on the banks of rivers but not on the seashore.<br\/><br\/>The greater or lesser extent of the leased parcel, as shown by the litigation in which the dominion of the lessor is in controversy, does not affect the rights of the latter, more especially if the possessor of a portion thereof has failed to prove that he owned it and that he possessed it as such owner.<br\/><br\/>It appears proven in the records that the applicant acquired the four parcels of land, including that which is the subject of the opposition, from the estate of his deceased mother; thus his right of ownership of the land in question is uncontrovertible, in spite of the opposition filed by Macario Angeles, who failed to establish his right to the lot which he is occupying as a mere tenant, according to the said decision rendered in the proceedings for ejectment determined on July 26, 1905, in favor of the applicant and against the objector.<br\/><br\/>For the above considerations we are of the opinion that the judgment appealed from, being in accordance with the law, should be and is hereby affirmed with the costs against the objectors, Marcelo Jiongco and Macario Angeles.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Ceballos y Mu\u00f1oz, on the 12th day of May, 1903, appointed the commissioners provided for by the law to appraise the said estate and to consider claims presented against it, and notice was given of the appointment of said commission and of the time and place when said commission would meet and consider claims against the said estate.\u00a0 On the 18th day of May, 1905, the said commissioners made a report to the lower court relating to the appraisement of the property of said estate and to the claims that had been\u00a0 presented.<br\/><br\/>On the 2d day of October, 1905, and by virtue of the provisions of sections 689 and 690 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, the lower court extended the time for two months within which the said commissioners might consider further claims against said estate.\u00a0 The reason given for said extension, as was said by the lower court, was that the said report had not been made in due form.\u00a0 Notice of this extension was duly published in a newspaper of general circulation, known as \"Libertas,\" and in the issues of said paper, for three consecutive weeks, upon the 2d, 8th, and 14th days of November, 1905.\u00a0 Upon the 25th day of January, 1906, said commission rendered its final account to the court, which was accepted and approved.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the first above assignment of error, section 689 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides that the court shall allow such time as the circumstances of the case require for the creditors to present their claims to the committee for examination and allowance, which time in the first instance shall not exceed twelve months, nor shall be less than six months, and which time shall be communicated to the said commission.\u00a0 Said section further provides that the time allowed in the first instance for the presentation of claims, etc., may be extended, as the circumstance may require, but that such time shall not be extended so that the whole time allowed for the presentation of claims, etc., shall exceed eighteen months.<br\/><br\/>Section 690 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides for a further extension of time upon the application of a creditor who has failed to present his claim for a period of six months.\u00a0 Section 690 further provides that if the committee fails to give the notice required by law, and an application is made by a creditor after the final settlement of the estate, the court may, for good cause shown, and on such terms as are equitable, renew the commission and allow further time, not exceeding one month for the committee to grant such claim.\u00a0 The appellant claims here that the notice which was published as above indicated in the \"Libertas\" was not sufficient for the reason that the same was not published for three successive weeks.\u00a0 As was stated above, the same was published in the issues of said newspaper upon the 2d, 8th, and 14th of the month of November.<br\/><br\/>Section 687 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides that the committee for the appraisement and allowance of claims shall appoint convenient times and places for the examination and allowance of claims, shall post a notice in four public places in the province stating the time and places of meetings, and the time limited for creditors to present their claims, and shall also publish the said notice three weeks successively in a newspaper of general circulation in the province, and shall give such further notice as the court may direct.\u00a0 It will\u00a0 be noted that one of the requirements is that the notice shall be published \"three weeks successively\" in a newspaper.\u00a0 This requirement simply means that the notice shall be published in three successive weeks, and further that three full weeks shall elapse between the time of the\u00a0 first notice and the time when the said commission commence the consideration of claims presented against an estate.\u00a0 (Ricketts <i>vs<\/i>. The Village of Hyde Park, 85 III, 110; The Savings and Loan Society <i>vs<\/i>. Thompson, 32 Cal., 347; Early <i>vs<\/i>. Doe, 16 How., 609.)<br\/><br\/>By reference to the calendar for the year 1905, it will be seen that the second, eighth and the fourteenth days of said month were days in three successive weeks.\u00a0 Of this fact the courts can take judicial notice.\u00a0 (Sec. 275, Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.)<br\/><br\/>Our conclusion is, therefore, that the notice given by the said commission complied with the requirements of the law.<br\/><br\/>The petition therefore of the plaintiff to have.the commission renewed or a new commission appointed for the purpose of considering claims based upon the ground that said commission did not give the notice required by law was properly denied by the lower court.<br\/><br\/>Section 695 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides that where a person having a claim against a deceased person does not, after the publication, exhibit his claim to the commission as provided for by law, he shall be barred from recovering such claim.\u00a0\u00a0 The petitioner did not present his claim in accordance with the provisions of the law and the lower court was justified in invoking the provisions of said section 695 and denying the petition of the\u00a0 claimant.\u00a0 Therefore the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

seem to be clearly established;<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That in the year 1871, Jose Garcia Suarez, a Spaniard, died in the municipality of Guinobatan, leaving a considerable amount of property.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That soon thereafter (the exact date does not appear), one Candido Dominguez was duly appointed (supposedly by <i>el Juzgado de bienes de difuntos<\/i>) as judicial administrator of said estate.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 That in the year 1873 (the exact date not appearing),the said Candido Dominguez died.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 That soon thereafter (the exact date not appearing of record), one Mateo Roco was duly appointed (supposedly <i>por el Juzgado de bienes de difuntos<\/i>) as administrator of said estate.<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 That the said Mateo Roco continued in possession of said estate, administering it until at least the year 1884 (the exact date not appearing in the record).<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 That after the said Mateo Roco ceased to actually administer the said estate it appears that Juliana Olino (the wife of the said Candido Dominguez) and her second husband, Tomas Gallegos, entered upon the administration of said estate (the record does not show by what authority) and continued administering the said estate, including the property mentioned in paragraphs <i>a, b, c, d, e<\/i>, and <i>f<\/i> of the complaint filed in the present cause, until the year 1901 or 1902.<br\/><br\/>Seventh.\u00a0 That in the latter part of 1901, or in the first part of\u00a0 1902, by an order of the provincial governor of the Province of Albay, the defendant municipality took possession of the property mentioned in said paragraphs <i>a, b, c, d, e<\/i>, and <i>f<\/i>, and has continued in the possession of said property ever since.<br\/><br\/>Eighth.\u00a0 That upon the 28th day of March, 1904, the plaintiff herein, at the petition of one Andrea Suarez, who pretended to be an heir of the said Jose Garcia Suarez, was appointed as administrator of the said estate.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, in an effort to settle the estate of the said Jose Garcia Suarez, and believing1 that the property described in said paragraphs <i>a, b, c, d, e<\/i>, and <i>f<\/i>, belonged to said estate, made a demand upon the defendant municipality for the possession of the same, which demand was refused, whereupon on the fourth day of January, 1906, the plaintiff brought the present action.\u00a0 The plaintiff alleged that the property mentioned in said paragraphs belonged to the estate of the deceased and that he, as administrator of said estate, was entitled to the possession of the same for the purposes of administering said estate.<br\/><br\/>To the petition of the plaintiff the defendant filed a general and a special denial.\u00a0 The special denial was simply the defense of prescription.\u00a0 The lower court, after hearing the evidence in said cause, found that the statutes of prescription had defeated the right of the plaintiff to recover, and also that the plaintiff had no interest whatever in the recovery of the possession of the property in question.<br\/><br\/>This was <i>not<\/i> an action brought for the purpose of declaring whether or not the said Jose Garcia Suarez had left any heirs.\u00a0 Neither is there any question raised with reference to the appointment of the plaintiff as administrator of said estate.\u00a0 And\u00a0 in view of the fact, which is clearly proven, that the said.\u00a0 Suarez died leaving a large estate in said province, and in view of the fact that said property was judicially administered from the time of his death up to and including the time when the defendant took possession of said property, it is difficult to see by what right or upon what basis-the defendant can claim the right to retain the possession of the property upon the theory of prescription.\u00a0 The record contains no\u00a0 proof whatever justifying the defendant in having taken possession of the property and certainly there is no proof to justify the defendant in continuing in the possession of the property to the exclusion of the plaintiff as administrator of said estate.<br\/><br\/>During the trial of the cause in the lower court a letter was introduced as evidence, written by the said Mateo Roco on the 4th day of January, 1899.\u00a0 From this letter the court drew the conclusion that the estate of the said Jose Garcia Suarez had been settled and that the property had been sold and disposed of.\u00a0 There is a statement in the said letter (Exhibit No. 2) from which\u00a0 this inference might be drawn, but the letter contains further statements which fully refute this idea and fully show that all of the property of said estate had not been sold.\u00a0 In said letter Mateo Roco said, after a statement of what had been done in the settlement of the estate:<br\/><br\/><blockquote><i>\"This property rather belongs to me by prescription<\/i> of ten years in my favor.\u00a0 I have been in lawful possession thereof as depositary for over 25 years, and, counting from the death of Suarez, more than 28 years, without interruption, profiting thereby quietly, peacefully, and without molestation.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The above-quoted statement shows clearly that all of the property of said estate had not been sold and that the administration of the estate had not been fully concluded.<br\/><br\/>From a record of the <i>Juzgado de bienes de difuntos<\/i>, which may be found in the archives of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, the fact appears that the estate of Jose Garcia Suarez was being administered under the direction of the said court from a time soon after the death of the said Suarez, and we respectfully call the attention of the plaintiff, the present administrator of the said estate, to this record in order that he may fully know just to what extent said estate had been administered by said court.<br\/><br\/>From all of the foregoing facts we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of the property mentioned in said paragraphs <i>a, b, c, d, e<\/i>, and <i>f<\/i>, for the purpose of administering the same, and without any special finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

JESUALDO GANA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 3d of February, 1906, Rufina Yatco brought these proceedings against Jesualdo Gana for the recovery of two parcels of arable land and one building lot situated in the municipality of Cabuyao, Province of La Laguna, a description of which is contained in the complaint.\u00a0 She prayed therein that the said lands be returned to her, that the defendant be sentenced to pay her P850 for losses and damages, that said defendant lose the crops existing thereon at the present time as well as the fruits of said lands, and that he pay the costs.\u00a0 Besides a general denial of all the facts alleged in the complaint, the defendant, on his part set up the following as special defense:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That he is the sole and exclusive owner of the building lot and the two parcels of land referred to in the complaint, he having acquired them from Eugenio Andal by a contract of purchase and sale on the 16th of October, 1894.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That he has been in the quiet and peaceful possession of the said property as owner for more than 11 years, to wit, since the aforesaid 16th day of October, 1894; and he asked to be absolved of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>At the hearing it was stipulated between the\u00a0 parties that the two parcels of unirrigated lands situated on the east and west side of the road from Calamba to Cabuyao, as well as the building lot concerning which the\u00a0 defendant had offered evidence, are the same as those claimed by the plaintiff.\u00a0 Documentary and oral evidence were presented by both parties to the suit, and the Court of First\u00a0 Instance of La Laguna in deciding the case absolved the defendant, Jesualdo Gana, of the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff Rufina Yatco.\u00a0 After moving for a new trial the plaintiff has appealed to this court from the said judgment by means of the corresponding bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>On appeal, and from the brief of the appellant and the evidence adduced by the parties, it appears that the court below drew the following conclusions of fact:<br\/><ol><li>That the plaintiff, as heir to her father, Isidro Yatco, among other properties, received the lands in controversy.<\/li><li>That in consequence of\u00a0 proceedings in execution brought in July, 1894, by the late Yatco against the spouses Eugenio Andal and Gregoria Faciolco, the said lands were attached on the 23d of March, 1895, and as no bidders appeared at the public auction, they were adjudicated in payment to the execution creditor by an order of the lower court dated April 15, 1898.\u00a0 The corresponding instrument of sale was not executed nor was the execution creditor put in possession of the property until the 26th and 27th of August, 1902, in compliance with an order dated February 21 of the same year, issued upon request of the said creditor.<\/li><li>That the credit of the execution creditor, Yatco, is not recorded in the registry of property, nor were the attached properties charged\u00a0 with the payment of any debts, or entered in the register; that the defendant debtor, Andal, had informed the officer who was sent to enforce the order of attachment, that the property now in question had already been sold by him to the defendant, Jesualdo Gana, prior to the date of the attachment.<\/li><li>That on the 16th of October, 1894, the defendant, Gana, acquired the said lands from Eugenio Andal by means of a public instrument of purchase and sale executed in the presence of Higinio Benitez, the late notary public of La Laguna; the said instrument was lost during the late insurrection, but appears on the index of the notarial acts executed in La Laguna, on file at the office of the clerk of the Supreme\u00a0 Court.<\/li><li>That since the said 16th day of October, 1894, the defendant has been in possession of the said properties and has held them as owner until the present day, with the exception of the years 1900 to 1904 when the tillage was suspended on account of public calamities, although the laborers continued to live there except during the reconcentration period in\u00a0 1902, when they were compelled by force to leave the said lands.<\/li><li>That the defendant was not required by the sheriff to deliver the possession of the lands to the representative of the late Yatco, and notwithstanding the proceedings in compliance with the order of February 21, 1902, already cited, the said defendant has continued up to the present day in the possession and enjoyment of the said lands.<br\/><\/li><\/ol>The court below found for the defendant, considering that it had been fully proven that the lands in controversy were sold to the principal of the plaintiff and to the defendant, and deciding the question as to which of the purchasers had acquired the ownership and dominion over the purchased thing in accordance with article 1473 of the Civil Code, the court also considered the fact that there was no entry in the register, and that besides being the first in possession the defendant had an older title, which circumstances the law assumes were accompanied by good faith, as the contrary has not been shown by the plaintiff.\u00a0 In addition thereto the court below considered that the action for recovery brought in this case lacked foundation because, although the deceased father of the plaintiff obtained the adjudication of the lands in question, there was no delivery, either real or symbolical, at the public sale in which the adjudication took place, and he could not have acquired any real right, from which an action for recovery, such as that brought in this case, might arise; that the debt which gave rise to the proceedings in execution was purely personal, it was not entered in the registry of property, nor had the lands in question any specific incumbrance; for these reasons the said property could be and was validly sold by its owner, Eugenio Andal, to the defendant Gana, notwithstanding the fact that Andal was a debtor of the late Yatco, father of the plaintiff; and finally, the fact that the defendant Gana did not intervene in the said proceedings in execution could not prejudice him as he could at any time avail himself of his title of ownership to the thing sold; nor could the adjudication of the property made in said proceedings operate against him because the property was not delivered to the execution creditor and he could not have acquired a title in re thereto.\u00a0 As the defendant had not lost his right of possession over the property under execution, he had no need to bring any action whatever, even though the sheriff of La Laguna had placed the representative of the plaintiff in possession in August, 1902, without notice to the defendant.\u00a0 The latter did not then lose his possession, nor was such present possession compatible, as a matter of fact, with that which the court, without the knowledge of the defendant, granted the plaintiff by a simple order, one which always implies the clause \"without prejudice to a third person having a better title.\"<br\/><br\/>Against the foregoing conclusions of fact and of law the appellant has submitted to this court the following statement of errors:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 In that the court below considered it proven that the defendant, Gana, had acquired the lands in question from Eugenio Andal on the 16th of October, 1894, by means of a public instrument of purchase and sale executed in the presence of Higinio Benitez, late notary public of La Laguna.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 In that the court below found that from that date the defendant has been in possession of the said lands, and has held them uninterruptedly until the present day, with the sole exception of the years specified in the judgment.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 In not holding that the purchase and sale above alluded to, if it was executed, was a purchase and sale in bad faith, and that the possession\u00a0 that the defendant invoked is uncertain.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 In conceding greater value and efficacy to a private contract than to the proceedings instituted and perfected by a court of competent jurisdiction, and in allowing the testimony of interested witnesses to prevail as against certified copies of proceedings conducted by authorized judicial officers with regard to acts that have been the subject of their mission.<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 In finding that the silence of the defendant in the face of the proceedings for the attachment, adjudication and possession of the claimed property does not prejudice him in any way.<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 In considering that the action exercised by the plaintiff is purely an action for recovery and one which she had no right to institute.<br\/><br\/>Seventh.\u00a0 In denying to the plaintiff the relief prayed for by her in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>As to the first, second, and fourth errors assigned, it must be taken into account that the lower court found that the defendant had acquired the lands in controversy by purchase, as shown by the testimony of Eugenio Andal, Jesualdo Gana, Saturnina Andal, and Ruperto Monterrey, and the written evidence brought from the register of the old <i>Audiencia Territorial<\/i> of these Islands where an index of the public instruments executed in the presence of the notaries throughout the Philippine Islands was kept.\u00a0 According to the foregoing it was considered that on the 23d of March, 1895, the time of levying upon the property of the spouses Eugenio Andal and Gregoria Faciolco, the former, in answer to questions put to him, stated that at that time he was a very poor man; that he had already sold to Jesualdo Gana the lands subject to the credit sued for by Isidro Yatco; that the instrument of sale had been drawn up and executed at the <i>tribunal<\/i> of Cabuyao in the presence of the municipal president who was then authorized by law to act as notary <i>ex officio<\/i>, and that the said proceedings were submitted to the notary of the province who incorporated the same in his protocol and reported it in the form\u00a0 of an index to the said <i>Audiencia Territorial<\/i>.\u00a0 The said provincial notary issued the original copy which the defendant said he possessed as title of his acquisition and which was burnt on August 28, 1904, at the fire that occurred in Bi\u00f1an, the town wherein he resided.\u00a0 These facts having been found by the court below and since no law is cited as having been violated, and while\u00a0 on the other hand the. finding is not contrary to the facts considered as proven, there is no reason for this Supreme Court to\u00a0 consider\u00a0 that\u00a0 any error was committed in the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>The same is true with regard to the length of time that the trial court found that the defendant has been in possession of the lands in question.\u00a0 This finding was based on the uniform testimony presented on the subject, and acts which evidence such possession on the part of the defendant; no other facts were alleged to overcome the same, or to show that any law was violated.<br\/><br\/>There is no error whatever in attributing greater value to a private contract than to the proceedings brought and completed before a court of competent jurisdiction, when such private contract sets out a consummated sale which transfers the ownership of the thing sold from the former owner, the vendor, to the present owner who purchased it, and where the judicial proceedings\u00a0 express nothing further than the adjudication made by the court of the said thing sold at public auction to another person, such court hot having required the owner to produce his title of ownership and to execute the instrument of sale in favor of the <i>adjudicataire<\/i> (the purchaser) for the actual transmission of the ownership to said person as the law provides.\u00a0 No preference was given by the court below in its judgment to the statements of the witnesses who testified as to the private contract over those of the judicial officers who in judicial proceedings certified to the fact of the public auction and the adjudication of the property to a particular person; it has given equal consideration to both and that which prevails is the value and efficiency of a consummated contract of sale in favor of one person, over a mere contract of sale in favor of another who did not take possession of the thing adjudicated to him at public auction, nor receive the deed of conveyance, or have it recorded in the registry of property as adjudicated to him.<br\/><br\/>As to the third assignment of error, it is impossible to admit the asseveration in the brief of the appellant, that the possession\u00a0 invoked by the defendant, adverse to the vendor himself, to the <i>adjudicataire<\/i>, and to all persons is a precarious possession when it is really, and in the most effective manner a possession under a title based upon a consideration, acquired, maintained, and held as a personal right arising out of a consummated contract.\u00a0 Neither could the judge find that there was bad faith on the part of the purchaser even though it be supposed such existed on the part of the vendor, because it has not been shown in any manner that the purchaser was aware of any impediment to the vendor's lawfully effecting the sale of a thing that belonged to him, and that had not ceased to be his, notwithstanding the fact that it was under judicial attachment, so long as said attachment was not recorded in the registry of property.<br\/><br\/>As to the fifth assignment of error, it must be held that the silence of the defendant in the face of the attachment proceedings, the adjudication and possession of the property claimed certainly does not prejudice him in any way, as was held by the trial judge; firstly, because it has not been shown that all of these proceedings were notoriously of public knowledge or that they should have been known to the defendant; and secondly, because even if they were so and if he positively knew of them he could not be prejudiced by failing to appear as a third party in the said proceedings in execution.\u00a0 With good reason did the court below apply in this case the provisions of article 1515 of the Law of <i>Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i> which was in force at the time the proceedings in execution were instituted, according to which \"actions to enforce the claims of third persons could be instituted at any stage of the proceedings in execution, but they could not be admitted after the execution of the instrument or consummation of the sale of the property to which the same referred, or after the adjudication of the property in payment and the delivery thereof to the judgment creditor; the right of the third person was reserved to bring such action as was proper against the proper parties.\"<br\/><br\/>As the commentator rightly says\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"None of these words are idle or superfluous.\u00a0 According to the Civil Code, and before its enactment, it was already common doctrine, that a contract of purchase and sale is perfected by the consent of the parties thereto as to the thing and the price, and is consummated upon the payment of the price and the delivery of the thing.\u00a0 There might be a question as to which of these acts would authorize intervention in accordance with the principles of law, and the law has preferred to fix the act of consummation, considering, no doubt, that until this is realized the property is at the disposition of the court having jurisdiction of the question of dominion, and which may deliver the property to the proper party, thus avoiding new complications and expenses.\u00a0 But even outside of the said term, or after the limit fixed by law, when the state of the proceedings in execution no longer permitted an intervention, and it was therefore the duty of the judge to reject the same by an order of dismissal, if the action was one for dominion, the right of the third party was reserved to\u00a0 institute an action against the proper person and as it might be proper, as provided in paragraph 2 of the said article, in order that there may be no doubt as to his being entitled to bring an action against the person who acquired the property.\"\u00a0 (Manresa, Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil, 641, 642 and 647.) <\/blockquote> Thus the right of action of the third party who was prejudiced by the judicial sale as to his intervention, could only be exercised while the proceedings in execution were pending and before the consummation of the judicial sale by any of the acts fixed in article 1515 of that law which was in force at the time, that is to say, before the execution of the public instrument of sale, or before the delivery of the thing sold adjudicated in payment; but' with respect to an\u00a0 action for recovery, the same may be exercised at any time so long as the right has not expired by limitation.\u00a0 Hence, the silence of the defendant in the face of the proceedings in connection with the attachment, adjudication, and possession of the property claimed, did not prejudice him in any way.<br\/><br\/>The stage reached by the proceedings in execution brought by the appellant's predecessor in the years 1894\u00a0 to 1898, did not go beyond that of adjudication in payment, that is,a mere perfecting of the purchase and sale which was not followed by the delivery of the thing, to-wit, by the actual delivery nor by the execution of the public instrument which would have been the symbolical transfer; and in view of the fact that the <i>jus in re<\/i> or right of dominion, the real meaning; of which\u00a0 is\u00a0 an action for recovery, is not transmitted except by the delivery or consummation of the purchase and sale, not by the mere perfecting thereof in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 609, and articles 1450 and 1462 of the Civil Code, it follows that the position taken by the trial court in denying the appellant's right to exercise said action when neither she nor her predecessor had yet acquired the right of dominion over the adjudicated lands which are now claimed, is in accordance with the law.\u00a0 The right of dominion could not be obtained by the judicial possession given to her predecessor on the 26th and 27th of August, 1902, as it referred to lands that were then in the possession of a third person, the defendant who was not a party in said proceedings in execution and not in that of the person who had been levied upon in the proceedings in execution in connection with which the decree of February 21 of said year was issued; neither did the extra-judicial demand made by the same appellant in 1905 upon the appellee herein, have any effect, because she was under the obligation to demand possession by means of this action against the present appellee.\u00a0 It was held in the decisions, in cassation of January 19, 1898 June 1, 1900, and March 8, 1901, that in proceedings in execution, the sale of the property, the adjudication thereof, and, in a word, a judicial auction sale, are nothing more than a perfect contract which is not consummated, however, until the due delivery of the thing has been made, notwithstanding the principle of the irrevocability of the sale after the same was held under the provisions of article 1480 of the <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i>; an irrevocability which evidently refers only to the contracting parties, with the\u00a0 exclusion, therefore, of third persons.\u00a0 Hence, the court below has not erred, as assigned in paragraphs, 6 and 7 of the bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as the main point is the legitimacy of the sale made by Eugenio Andal to Jesualdo Gana, and in view of the fact that this contract was executed even before the lands that were sold had been judicially attached, the trial court has not committed any error by declaring that Eugenio Andal could validly sell them to Jesualdo Gana; and the circumstance that they were subject to the credit of Isidro Yatco against the spouses Andal and Faciolco was not an obstacle to the validity of the sale because they were not subject to the security of the credit as by a real right formally attached to the said lands, but by the mere delivery of the title deeds that the debtors made to the creditors.<br\/><br\/>For all of the above reasons the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

W. Prising, plaintiff and appellee.<br\/><br\/>These claims, numbered three and four in the report of the commissioners, were reported upon by them as follows:<br\/><blockquote><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>\"Claim No. 3.-F. W. Prising, claimant.<\/i><br\/><\/div><br\/>\"This is a claim amounting to P7,443.91 composed of various items of cash advanced personally to the deceased and bills paid for his account as shown by claims attached.\u00a0 These various items are supported by the signature of the deceased as to part of them and as to the remainder by vouchers which seem to be genuine and unquestionable.\u00a0 (See vouchers attached to claim.)\u00a0 Your commissioners, therefore, allow the claim of F. W. Prising for P7,443.91, subject to offset hereinafter mentioned.<br\/><br\/>\"Mr. M, E. Springer, the executor of this estate, presents to your commissioners as an offset to the claim of F. W. Prising last above allowed, two claims in favor of the estate and against said F. W. Prising as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"The first claim is a promissory note payable to John Kernan, signed by F. W. Prising at Manila, March 19, 1906, for the sum of P7,278.85, with legal interest after maturity, due one year after date-interest thereon amounting to P266.89, or a total due the estate of P7,545.74.\u00a0 The genuineness of this note is admitted.\u00a0 There are two indorsements appearing on the note of payments thereon-one under date of March 29, 1906, for 4,490.64, which your commissioners find to be the identical sum composed of the first three items of the account presented by Mr. Prising against the estate, and one credit indorsement under date of April 20, 1906, of P350 which your commissioners find to be the identical sum constituting the fourth item of Mr. Prising's claim against the estate.\u00a0 Your commissioners, therefore, ignore said two credit indorsements, and allow the estate on said promissory note P7,545.74 against said Prising as an offset against the claim presented by him and allowed in his favor in this report.\u00a0 (See note, Exhibit A.)<br\/><br\/>\"The second claim exhibited and presented by the executor against said Prising is a claim for a shortage in property, moneys and credits of the firm of Prising &amp; Kernan and amounts to P13,315.41-one-half of which, or P6,657.70 is due the above estate.\u00a0 This claim arises from the following circumstances:<br\/><br\/>\"The deceased, Kernan, and claimant Prising are partners in an unregistered partnership, having for its\u00a0 object the carrying on of live-stock business.\u00a0 On March 16, 1906, a balance sheet was made and signed by both partners.\u00a0 (See Exhibit B.)\u00a0 This balance sheet showed stock on hand, cash and bills receivable aggregating a considerable sum.\u00a0 On March 20, 1907, Mr. Prising rendered a statement to the executor (Exhibit C), which statement showed a reduction in stock, cash on hand and bills receivable of P13,315.41 as shown in detail by statement of differences (Exhibit D).\u00a0 This shortage is unexplained.\u00a0 We, therefore, charge one-half thereof, or P6,657.70 against said Prising and allow the claim of the estate as an offset for said amount.<br\/><br\/>\"In order to make clear the findings of the commissioners as to the Prising claim and offsets, we make the following-<br\/><br\/><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan=\"2\"><div align=\"center\">\"RESUME'. <\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td width=\"73%\">\u00a0<\/td> <td width=\"27%\">\u00a0<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\"><p>First offset presented by executor, promissory note Prising to Kernan, Exhibit A, allowed<\/p><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"right\">P7,545.74<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">Second offset exhibited by executor, shortage in assets Prising-Kernan, Exhibits B, C, and D, allowed<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"right\">6,657.70<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">Total claims of estate allowed against Prising<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><div align=\"right\">14,103.44<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">Less claim of F.

W. Prising, claimant<\/i><br\/><\/div><br\/>\"This claim consists of a draft drawn by J. Kernan\u00a0 on F. W. Prising in favor of Said Hashim, dated October 17, 1904, for the sum of P4,000.\u00a0 It is evident to your commissioners that this is not a valid claim.\u00a0 In the first\u00a0 place, from 1904 down to the date of his death, Mr. Kernan was in affluent circumstances, engaged in extensive business in Manila and during said time usually had a considerable amount of ready money\u00a0 on hand.\u00a0 Again, Mr. Kernan, during said period, invested the sum of P22,847.78 of capital in the firm of Prising &amp; Kernan (see Exhibit B), to which firm it does not appear that Prising contributed any capital whatever.\u00a0 Further it appears from Exhibit B, that on March 19, 1906, a balance was struck between Mr. Prising and Mr. Kernan, and the sum of P7,278.85 was found to be due Mr. Kernan, for which sum Prising gave his promissory note, Exhibit A.\u00a0 Where was Mr. Prising's draft for P4,000 at the time he gave said note?\u00a0 Why, if the draft remained unpaid, was it not offset against the amount shown to be due Mr. Kernan by said balance of account?\u00a0 The commissioners answer these two questions for themselves by finding that the draft had been paid.\u00a0 More than this, the will of the deceased Kernan, dated March 15, 1906, states that there has been a complete settlement between the deceased and Prising.\u00a0 It is true that the draft was found in the possession of claimant, but this fact is easily explainable in several ways.\u00a0 It is probable that the\u00a0 draft was drawn against Mr. Prising to be paid out of funds of Mr. Kernan in the Prising-Kernan partnership, and that it was as a matter of fact so paid and probably constituted a part of the charge of P15,568.93 shown against the deceased in the settlement of March 16, 1906 (Exhibit B).\u00a0 Again, the draft may have been paid by Mr: Kernan and taken into his possession and left by him among his other papers and effects in the possession of Mr. Prising when the deceased left Manila in 1906-Mr. Prising being left in charge of his affairs under power of attorney.\u00a0 The mere fact of the possession of the instrument by the claimant being explainable upon several probable and reasonable grounds, your commissioners can not permit such mere fact of possession to outweigh the other facts and circumstances related which to our minds demonstrate conclusively the payment of the draft, and, therefore, the claim of F. W. Prising for P4,000 is disallowed.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">(Signed)\u00a0 \"HENRY M. JONES,<br\/>(Signed)\u00a0 \"S. FELDSTEIN,<br\/><br\/><i>\"Committee.\"<\/i><\/div><\/blockquote>The claimant Prising appealed from the findings of the commissioners to the Court of First Instance, and obtained a judgment for P4,165.06, the balance which the court found due the plaintiff after deducting the amount of plaintiff's promissory note in favor of the deceased from the aggregate amount of the payment which the commissioners found had been made to Kernan by Prising after the date of the settlement referred to in the commissioners' report together with the amount of the draft for P4,000, as to which the trial court reversed the findings of the commissioners.<br\/><br\/>In the course of the proceedings in the Court of First Instance, the defendant executor waived his claim to a set-off on account of the alleged shortage of partnership property, reserving the right to institute a separate action for\u00a0 any balance which may be found due the estate after a liquidation of the accounts, and the winding up of the affairs of the partnership; defendant executor insisted, however, that without relying upon the set-off allowed by the commissioners on account of the alleged unexplained shortage in the partnership assets, judgment should be rendered against the plaintiff for the sum of P101.63, that being the difference between the aggregate amount of the claims of F. W. Prising allowed against the estate by the commissioners, on account of payments made Kernan and his estate, and the amount of Prising's promissory note in favor of the deceased, together with interest from its date until the date of the commissioners' report.\u00a0 The trial court declined to allow the interest claimed upon Prising's promissory note, which was made payable one year after its date and without interest until maturity, it appearing that before the note arrived at maturity, the plaintiff had paid to the deceased various sums amounting to P7,443.91, which the court held to have been an overpayment of the amount of the note, by the sum of P165.06, which plaintiff is entitled to recover from\u00a0 the estate.\u00a0 On appeal to this court from the decision of the court below the defendant executor assigns no error based on the action of the court in this regard, and limits himself to a discussion of his assignment of error based upon the action of the court in reversing the findings of the commissioners as to the claim evidenced by the draft for P4,000.<br\/><br\/>The trial court was of opinion that the presumption of nonpayment by Kernan of the amount advanced upon the draft, which is raised by the fact that the draft in question was in the possession of the plaintiff and by him produced before the commissioners, was not overcome by the evidence of payment relied upon by the commissioners nor by the evidence of payment introduced at the trial.\u00a0 We can not agree with this finding, and in the language of the commissioners, \"we can not permit such mere fact of possession to outweigh the other facts and circumstances\" established by the evidence of record, \"which to our minds, demonstrate conclusively the payment of the draft.\"<br\/><br\/>The draft was drawn in Manila on the 17th day of October, 1904.\u00a0 At the time of the drawing of the draft, and for some time previous thereto, Prising and Kernan had been engaged as partners, under the firm name of \"F. W. Prising\", in the importation of cattle into Manila.\u00a0 Kernan furnished all\" the capital, some 22,000 odd pesos, Prising as industrial partner receiving one-half the profits.\u00a0 In 1906, Kernan having been stricken with what proved to be a fatal illness, was compelled to go to Europe for treatment.\u00a0 Both Kernan and Prising realizing the gravity of the sick man's condition, prepared a statement of accounts, a short time before Kernan's departure, dated March 16, 1906, from which it appears that, in accordance with the agreement under which they were operating, there had been returned to Kernan; P15,568.93 of the original capital of P22,847.78 advanced by him, leaving a balance still due of P7,278.85, payment of which it was agreed would place him and his partner on an equal basis as joint partners and owners of the business.\u00a0 On the 19th of March, Prising executed and delivered to Kernan his promissory note of P7,278.85 to cover the balance thus shown to be due to Kernan, and at the same time, Kernan made the following notation at the foot of the balance sheet:\u00a0 \"Balance due John Kernan as per above account is covered by promissory note of F. W. Prising of this date, March 19, 1906.\u00a0 (Signed) J. Kernan.\"\u00a0 From the date of the execution of this promissory note until the death of the testator, which occurred some months later, Prising paid out certain sums on behalf of Kernan in Manila, and forwarded to him certain other sums while in Europe, aggregating in all a little more than sufficient to cancel the note.\u00a0 Before leaving Manila, Kernan executed his last will and testament; and on or about the same date, he executed a general power of attorney in favor of Prising giving him full power and authority to represent him during his absence from the Philippines in all his business and other interests.<br\/><br\/>The first question which presents itself is whether the draft was drawn on F. W. Prising, personally, or upon the partnership, operating under the firm name of F. W. Prising, and aside from the testimony of the plaintiff himself on his examination in chief, and the vague, indefinite, and uncertain testimony of his witnesses, A. T. Hashim and Said Hashim, and the fact that the name of the drawee appears in the draft as F. W. Prising, esq., all the other evidence of record strongly points to the conclusion that it was drawn upon and paid by the partnership, operating under the firm name of F. W. Prising.<br\/><br\/>The addition of the somewhat unusual title, esq., is explained by the testimony of the plaintiff's witness, A. T. Hashim, an East Indian, who states that Kernan had no knowledge of business methods, and asked the witness to prepare the draft.\u00a0 Hashim being accustomed to English methods, added the title esq. to the name of the drawee, and it must be admitted that the use of this title in the draft tends to support the claimant's contention that the draft was drawn on him personally; andthat this inference is strengthened by the testimony of both the Hashims who testified that at the time of the execution of the draft Kernan informed him that he proposed to borrow money from Prising to invest in the business of Said Hashim.\u00a0 But in the light of the other evidence of record, we are not disposed to give much weight to the testimony of the Hashims; not merely because it is vague, unsatisfactory, and indefinite, but because it is very clear from their testimony that they knew nothing of the business relations existing between Kernan and Prising; and granting that they were endeavoring truthfully to relate their recollection of Kernan's statements in regard to the draft, it may be that, not being aware that the firm of Prising &amp; Kernan operated under the firm name of F. W. Prising, and learning from Kernan that he expected to have the money he needed advanced by his partner, Prising, they erroneously inferred that Kernan's intention was to borrow that money from Prising, personally.\u00a0 Kernan, who appears to have known\u00a0 little or nothing as to the proper mode of executing a draft, may well be supposed to have attached no special significance to the insertion of the title after Prising's name; and in any event, in view of the loose and irregular methods under which the partnership business and the mutual transaction of the partners appear to have been conducted, the addition of the title would not necessarily prevent Prising from paying the draft out of the partnership funds, and can not be considered by any means decisive as to whether the draft was or was not thus paid, which is the real question at issue.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff himself, whose testimony was admitted without objection, testified that the draft was drawn upon him personally and\u00a0 paid by him out of his personal funds, and that it had nothing whatever to do with the partnership transactions between himself and Kernan.\u00a0 He was called upon to produce the books and other records of the partnership, for the purpose of verifying his\u00a0 statements, but this he said he could not do, because Kernan when he left the Philippines carried with him \"all his documents.\"\u00a0 This explanation of his refusal to produce the books and records of the partnership business is, to our minds, wholly unsatisfactory.\u00a0 It will be noticed that the claimant did not expressly testify that Kernan carried away the books of the partnership, but limited himself to the mere statement that \"he took all his documents with him,\" so that, even were this testimony true, it\u00a0 would not afford a satisfactory excuse for plaintiff's failure to produce the books of the partnership in open court when called upon so to do.\u00a0 And if it be admitted that the term \"documents,\" as used by the witness, is wide enough to include all the books and records of the partnership, we think this testimony must be rejected as manifestly false in the light of the other facts in evidence.\u00a0 The witness himself apparently recognizing how incredible and improbable was the story he told, used the following language in this connection:\u00a0 \"Strange to say, although John Kernan left me a power of attorney, he took all his documents with him; at least I never could find any of them after he left.\"\u00a0 It would indeed be strange if Kernan had carried away the books and records of the partnership business.\u00a0 In the first place, Prising was the managing partner, and as such the partner under whose control and in whose\u00a0 keeping we would naturally expect to find the books and records of the company.\u00a0 In the second place, Kernan was leaving the Islands suffering from a fatal illness which Prising, at least, well knew rendered it improbable that he should ever return; before leaving he made a general settlement of the affairs of the business with his partner, and together they signed the balance of accounts struck at that time, and formally reduced to writing the agreed status of the business as they then understood it; no reason has been suggested, nor are we able to imagine one which could have induced Kernan to carry off the books and records of the business under such circumstances, and we refuse to believe that, had he attempted to do so, the managing partner would have permitted it, without protest; being responsible for the continuance of the business, it would appear to have been absolutely essential that he should retain in his hands the books and papers pertaining thereto, and indeed it was clearly his duty so to do.\u00a0 Finally, if the facts already set out were not sufficient to render wholly incredible the testimony of the plaintiff as to the whereabouts of these books and records, the further consideration that Kernan executed a general power of attorney in favor of the plaintiff, whereby he placed in plaintiff's hands not merely the partnership interests which they held in common, but also all his personal affairs in these Islands, including stock in other companies, and various parcels of real estate, renders plaintiff's story so improbable that in the light of all the evidence of record we do not hesitate to stamp it as false, and manifestly fabulated for the purpose of defeating the efforts of the executor of his deceased friend and partner from ascertaining the true status of the partnership transactions.\u00a0 Under these circumstances, we are forced to the conclusion that plaintiff having declined to produce the books and records in his possession or which should be in his possession, willfully suppressed them; and that, if they had been produced, their contents would have been adverse to his claim, and would establish the fact that the draft in question was drawn upon and accepted by the partnership operating under the firm name of F. W. Prising and paid out of partnership funds.\u00a0 (Code of Civil Procedure, sec. 334, subsec. 5.)<br\/><br\/>We are confirmed in this conclusion by an examination of the circumstances under which the draft was drawn, as they appear from the record.\u00a0 At that time Prising was the working and managing member of the firm of Prising &amp; Kernan, the latter having advanced all the capital, and in accordance with the agreement under which they operated, the business was to return to Kernan the capital advanced by him as rapidly as it could be spared.\u00a0 It appears that during the existence of the partnership a considerable sum, amounting to P15,568.93 was returned to Kernan, and in the ordinary course of business, and in the absence of proof to the contrary, we would expect to find that part of the money thus paid was evidenced by the draft.\u00a0 Plaintiff tells a highly improbable story of his transactions with Kernan in connection with this draft, and claims and pretends that Kernan offered him extraordinary inducements to make the loan, agreeing to\u00a0 give plaintiff a share in his interest in Hashim's business which would seem to be out of all proportion to the amount of the draft.\u00a0 No reason has been suggested nor does any appear why Kernan should have felt himself under such urgent necessity to borrow this money from his partner personally, at a time when his partner was under an obligation, as manager of their joint business, to pay over the profits of the business as rapidly as they could be spared; and while it is not impossible that Prising might have had his own private capital from which he could have paid the draft, the evidence tends to indicate that he had no capital of his own, and that such money as he had in his control came from the business in\u00a0 which he and his partner were engaged.\u00a0 Furthermore, if Kernan, as alleged by plaintiff, had borrowed this money from his partner personally, and obligated himself to pay such exceptional remuneration for the accommodation, and if the alleged loan had been made by means of a draft, it is hardly credible that the parties would have let the matter stand without any other memorandum as to the terms of the transaction for nearly two years and until Kernan left the Islands without any definite expectation of returning.\u00a0 That it would be left in that condition, notwithstanding the settlement of accounts by the partners before Kernan's departure, and the execution of the note by Prising for the balance\u00a0 found due on that account, is wholly incredible and beyond belief.<br\/><br\/>We are convinced that the draft was drawn upon the partnership operating under the firm name of F. W. Prising and paid out of partnership funds, and that being a fact, there can be no reasonable doubt that the amount paid thereon was included in the credit of Pl 5,568.93 allowed Prising in the statement of accounts signed by the partners just prior to Kernan's departure.\u00a0 The execution and delivery by Prising to Kernan of the note for P7,278.85, the balance due as shown by that statement of accounts,\u00a0 is prima facie evidence of the settlement and adjustment of all demands existing at that time between the parties arising out of their partnership transactions.\u00a0 Without some satisfactory\u00a0 explanation of the omission of the amount of the draft from the account stated, either by fraud, mistake, express agreement, or the like, the mere fact that the draft was found in the hands of the plaintiff at the time when he presented his claim is not sufficient to overcome this presumption.\u00a0 (Perry <i>vs<\/i>.

Sanford, 36\u00a0 Ala., 703; Daniel on Negotiable Instruments, Vol. I, sec. 71, and cases cited); and this especially in view of the fact that the possession of the draft by Prising, notwithstanding the fact that he had received credit therefor as managing partner of the firm of Prising &amp; Kernan, is explainable either on the ground that as such manager, he retained it with the partnership records, which were in his charge, as a voucher evidencing its payment from partnership funds, or that having taken over all Kernan's effects under his power of attorney, the draft, if it had been delivered to Kernan at the time of the settlement of accounts, thus fell into Prising's hands.<br\/><br\/>No satisfactory explanation of the alleged fact that the amount of the draft was not included in the final statement of accounts between the partners was offered by the plaintiff, and indeed it is difficult to conceive of any reason which could have induced the parties to have omitted it, unless it were by mistake or inadvertence, and plaintiff swore that he spoke of the draft to Kernan on several occasions before he left, and thus impliedly admitted that, its alleged omission was not due to an oversight.\u00a0 Plaintiff attempted to explain the omission by claiming that the account was limited to partnership transactions and that the draft evidencing a personal loan was not included for that reason.\u00a0 As we have said, we are convinced that the draft represented a payment from partnership funds and not a personal loan; but we might add that, even on the assumption that the draft did represent a personal loan, plaintiff's claim that this loan has never been paid, and that ft was not included in the final settlement with Kernan is in the highest degree improbable and incredible.\u00a0 That Prising would and did execute the note in favor of Kernan for P7,278,85, in settlement of a balance due on the purchase price of an interest in the partnership, without reducing the amount of the note by the amount due him on the loan, would be difficult to believe in the absence of proof of mistake or oversight, and his testimony to the effect that, although the loan\u00a0 was still outstanding, he did not insist or even ask for such reduction, is wholly incredible.\u00a0 At the time when the note was executed, Kernan was about to leave the Islands, probably never to return.\u00a0 Prising held no written evidence of the alleged loan or of the conditions under which it was made other than the draft itself, which was nearly eighteen months old, and the reasons which induced the partners to make a final settlement of the partnership transactions and which led to the execution of the note for the balance shown due under that settlement, would seem to preclude the possibility that they would have neglected to include the alleged personal loan in the final settlement of their mutual transactions.<br\/><br\/>After twenty days let judgment be entered reversing the judgment of the trial court without costs in this instance, the costs in first instance to be against the plaintiff, and let judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff for P165.06, and ten days thereafter let the record be returned to the court from whence it came.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Gaz., 1433)<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>, the qualification of a crime is not confined to the qualification given by the fiscal in the first part of his complaint.\u00a0 The crime must be qualified by the description of the offense given in the body of the complaint and if the evidence supports the\u00a0 facts alleged in the body of the complaint, the parties should be punished in accordance with the real offense described and not in accordance with the qualification given by the fiscal.\u00a0 The aggressors were accused of the act generically qualified as <i>lesiones<\/i>.\u00a0 The greater or less gravity of the wounds does not change its juridical nature; a <i>lesion<\/i> is a wound light compared with a more serious one, and only influences the degree of punishment fixed by law, so that the premature qualification of the offense as <i>menos grave<\/i> in the fiscal's complaint, does not prejudge the result of the evidence, during the hearing of which the offender was present and of the import of which he was well aware.<br\/><br\/>In the present case the body of the complaint contains allegations sufficient to justify the conclusion that the offense committed by the appellant was <i>lesiones graves<\/i> and not <i>lesiones menos graves<\/i> as denominated by the fiscal and the proof fully sustains the allegations in the body of the complaint.\u00a0 Therefore, under the allegations and the proof adduced during the trial in the present case, we are of the opinion and so hold that the judgment of the lower court should be reversed and that the penalty imposed by the lower court in accordance with article 418 of the Penal Code, should have been in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph 2 of paragraph 4 of article 416.\u00a0 Said subparagraph of paragraph 4 of article 416 provides that if the acts should be committed against any of the persons specified in article 402 or with any of the attendant circumstances specified in article 403 of said code, and the party injured should be disabled from pursuing his usual occupation for a period lasting more than thirty days, the punishment shall be that of <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum and medium degrees.\u00a0 In the present case the fact that the other two defendants captured the person injured upon the highway and manacled him and carried him to the house of the appellant herein and there held him while the appellant beat him with his cane, in our opinion constitutes the attendant circumstance specified in paragraph 1 of article 403, and therefore the appellant should be punished with the penalty of <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum and medium degrees.\u00a0 There being no aggravating or extenuating circumstances attending the commission of the offense, in accordance with the provision of paragraph 2 of article 80, the minimum penalty of that prescribed should be imposed.\u00a0 Therefore, the sentence of the lower court, imposing the penalty of five months upon the appellant, is hereby\u00a0 revoked, and it is hereby directed that the appellant be sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of one year, eight months, and twenty-one days of <i>prision correccional<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Yllarde, the offended party, testified that he was a night watchman and that he received P15 per month; that he was disabled from pursuing his usual occupation for a period of two months; that he earned each year, outside of his salary, about P140.\u00a0 His loss of salary for two months then would be P30.\u00a0 The proportional\u00a0 loss of P140 for two months we find to be about P24.\u00a0 The loss, therefore, which the injured party suffered during the period during which he was disabled by the unlawful acts of the defendant, was about P54.<br\/><br\/>Upon the foregoing facts, in our opinion, the sentence of the lower court should be modified with reference to the indemnity imposed.\u00a0 The sentence of the lower court should be revoked.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the defendant, Ponciano Treyes, is hereby sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of one year eight months and twenty-one days of<i> prision correccional<\/i>, to pay one-third of the costs of the lower court and to pay the costs of this court, and to indemnify the injured party, Juan Yllarde, in the sum of P54, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of the law.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Bates, judge of the Ninth Judicial District.\" <\/blockquote> <br\/>From this sentence the plaintiff appealed.<br\/><br\/>No motion was made for a new trial in the court below.\u00a0 The plaintiff excepted only to the judgment of the lower court, basing his objection upon the ground that the sentence of the lower court\u00a0 was contrary to the provisions of said article 582, and in this court insists that he has a right under said provisions of the Civil Code to have said windows closed and to have the defendant prohibited from making openings in the side of the house overlooking his yard except those openings provided for under said article.<br\/><br\/>Article 581 of the Civil Code is as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"ART.\u00a0 581.\u00a0 The owner of a wall which is not a party wall, adjoining another's estate, may make in it windows or openings to admit light, at the height of the ceiling joists or immediately under the ceiling, of the dimensions of thirty centimeters square, and, in any case, with an iron grate embedded in the wall and a wire screen.<br\/><br\/>\"However, the owner of the house or estate adjoining the wall in which the openings are made may close them, if he acquires the part ownership of the wall and should there be no agreement to the contrary.<br\/><br\/>\"He may also obstruct them by building on his land or raising a wall adjacent\u00a0 to that having\u00a0 such opening or window.\" <\/blockquote> Article 582 of the Civil Code provides as follows :<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"ART.\u00a0 582.\u00a0 Windows with direct views, or balconies or any similar openings\u00a0 projecting\u00a0 over the estate of the neighbor, can not be made if there is not a distance of, at least, two meters between the wall in which they are built and said estate.<br\/><br\/>\"Neither can side nor oblique views be opened over said property, unless there is a distance of sixty centimeters.\" <\/blockquote> <br\/>The foregoing provisions of the Civil Code enumerate the conditions under which an adjoining lot owner may enjoy the easement of light and view.\u00a0 These provisions are positive and persons attempting to exercise easement of light and view upon property of adjoining landowners are governed by its provisions.\u00a0 Said article 582 absolutely prohibits the construction of windows with direct views, or balconies or any similar openings projecting over adjoining property, unless there is a distance of at least 2 meters between the wall in which they are built and the adjoining property.\u00a0 The evidence adduced during the trial in the court below was not brought here.\u00a0 Therefore, we are governed as to the facts by the findings of the lower court.\u00a0 The lower court found that the distance between the wall of the house of the defendant and the dividing line between the two lots was only 71 centimeters.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant, therefore, has violated the provisions of said article 582 by building his house nearer the line of the property of the plaintiff than a distance of 2 meters.<br\/><br\/>Said article 581 provides the character of windows or openings in a wall adjoining the property of another when such wall is constructed nearer the dividing line of the two properties than 2 meters.\u00a0 In the present case the defendant constructed his house so that the wall looking upon the property of the plaintiff was less than 2 meters from the dividing line.\u00a0 He can, therefore, only construct such windows as are provided for in said article 581.<br\/><br\/>The lower court bases his conclusions largely upon the fact that the\u00a0 plaintiff had stood by and permitted the defendant to construct, or partially construct, his house without having made any objections, as well as the further fact that the plaintiff had received no damages whatever except purely sentimental damages.\u00a0 The first ground would seem to imply that the lower court was of the opinion that the plaintiff was estopped from insisting upon his rights under the law, he having permitted the defendant to partially construct the house in the manner above described.\u00a0 There is nothing in the decision of the lower court which shows that the plaintiff at any time before the commencement of the present action knew that the house of the defendant was being constructed in violation of the provisions of said above-quoted articles.\u00a0 It was the duty of the defendant to construct his house in accordance with the provisions of the law.\u00a0 The plaintiff was not obliged to stand by for the purpose of seeing that the defendant had not violated the law.\u00a0 There\u00a0 are many cases where the doctrine of estoppel may be invoked against one who claims a right where he has stood by and either expressly or tacitly given his consent to a violation of his right by another.\u00a0 This doctrine, however, can not be invoked where the law imposes an express duty upon the other person and prohibits him from the exercise of certain acts in a\u00a0 certain way.\u00a0 The defendant only can blame himself for not constructing his house in the manner provided for by law under the facts in the present case.\u00a0 (See decision of the supreme court of Spain, June 6,1892; 4 Manresa, 734, 735, 736-739; 9 Alcubilla, 541.)<br\/><br\/>Under all of the facts and the law presented in the present case, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the defendant is not <i>entitled to the easement of light and view which the windows and openings<\/i>, which he has made in the house\u00a0 in question, <i>give him<\/i>, and, because of the fact that he has constructed his house nearer than 2 meters to the dividing line between his property and the property of the plaintiff, he is only entitled to the easement of light and view provided for in said article 581 above quoted.\u00a0 Therefore, let a judgment be entered reversing the judgment of the lower court\u00a0 with costs, and directing the defendants, within a period of thirty days from the receipt of the notice of this decision, to close the said openings and windows, in the said house, looking directly upon the property of the plaintiff.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Rocha &amp; Co. was made defendant in this action, because soon after plaintiff's retirement from Carman &amp; Co., and prior to the institution of these proceedings, Rocha &amp; Co. took over the business of Carman &amp; Co., arid expressly assumed all its debts and obligations. Judgment was rendered in the lower court in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P44,969.90, and from that judgment defendant company appealed, and brings the case here by its duly certified bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>There is no serious dispute as to the material facts in the case, the solution of the questions involved resting largely upon the proper construction of the articles of partnership under which Carman &amp; Co. was organized.<br\/><br\/>On December 5,1898, a partnership known as a \"sociedad mercantil en comandita\" was organized under the firm name of \"Carman y Compa\u00f1ia\" of which the <i>socios colectivos y gerentes<\/i> (directing partners) were Dickerson M.

Co. paying the vendor, in addition to the price set upon its vessels, a further sum of 20,000 pesos for the good will of its business.\u00a0 The business for which the company was organized was carried on at a large profit by Carman &amp; Co., until it was taken over by the defendant company on or about the 14th of February, 1904, the new company as suming all the obligations of the old.\u00a0 New vessels were purchased during this period, and extensive repairs and improvements were placed on the old vessels purchased of Dominguez &amp; Co., and at the close of each semester the accounts of the company were balanced, and profits distributed among the partners, by crediting their respective shares to their individual accounts.<br\/><br\/>On January 25 and 29, 1904, plaintiff gave notice in writing of his intention and desire to avail, himself of the privilege of retiring from the company as authorized in the sixth clause of the articles of partnership; and on February 4, 1904, in reply to a letter received from Carman &amp; Co., he agreed to accept payment of the amount due him on severing his connection with the company in four equal installments, the first payable on the first day of the following July, the remaining installments at intervals of six months thereafter, the total amount to bear interest at the rate of 6 per cent until paid, on condition that his separation from the company be agreed to have taken effect as of January 31, 1904, and that he be relieved of all responsibility for the operations of the company thereafter; the company to make an inventory as of that date for the determination of the amount which he was entitled to withdraw.\u00a0 To this proposition the company acceded, and this action has its origin in the dispute which thereafter arose as to the amount which plaintiff was entitled to receive on the date of his withdrawal.<br\/><br\/>On March 29,1904, Carman &amp;

16,158.03 pesos, the amount of his share of the earnings of the company as shown by the statement; 363.94 pesos, the amount to the credit of his account-current and further his proportionate share of the amounts which appear in the statement as \"reserve fund\" and \"amortization of material\" fund.<br\/><br\/>Defendant company denies the claim of plaintiff to any share in the \"reserve fund\" or the \"amortization of material\" fund, and contends that plaintiff was entitled to withdraw no more than the amount of his capital, profits, and credit on account-current, as shown in the statement, after deducting therefrom his proportionate share of the amounts which appear in the list of assets as \"premium on business (good will)\" and \"amortization of shares.\"<br\/><br\/>The evidence of record discloses that the item of 123,444.46 pesos against the words \"lighterage plant\" includes the original cost price (with a small percentage added by agreement of the parties) of the lighterage vessels purchased from Dominguez &amp; Co., to which is added the cost price of various vessels purchased since that date and the cost price of improvements put upon these vessels; that the item of 20,000 pesos against the words \"premium on business (good will)\" is the amount paid by the company to Dominguez &amp; Co. for the good will of their business; that the item 21,500 pesos against the words \"amortization of shares\" is the amount paid by the company out of funds of the company for certain shares of some of the original partners who withdrew from the company; that the items set out after the names of the various partners, with the words \"account-current (as directing partner)\" added, represent the amount of capital originally invested in the company by the respective partners; that the items set out after the names of the partners, with the word \"earnings\" added, represent the estimated earnings which the respective partners were entitled to have credited to their accounts on the 31st of January, 1904; that the item of 50,630.73 pesos against the words \"amortization of material\" represents the estimated accumulations in the amortization fund provided for in clause 10 of the articles of agreement; and that the item of 31,700 pesos against the words \"reserve fund\" represents the estimated accumulations in that fund provided for in clause 9.\u00a0 The other items contained in the statement explain themselves and need not be examined separately.<br\/><br\/>With this explanation of the various items contained in the statement, its meaning may be expressed in language stripped of its bookkeeping form, as follows:\u00a0 The sum total of earnings of the company for distribution on the 31st of January, 1904 (which is the sum total of the various items on the list of liabilities set against the names of the various partners with the word \"earnings\" annexed), is the result obtained by deducting the total amount of the other so-called liabilities (consisting of debts due by the company represented by bills payable or on current account; the capital originally invested in the company, which was applied to the purchase of original plant and good will; and the estimated amount which under the articles of partnership it was agreed should be placed in the reserve fund and the fund for amortization of plant) from the total amount of the so-called assets (consisting of cash on hand and on deposit; debts due the company; the cost price of plant on hand at organization and of plant acquired since organization; the cost price of good will; and the cost price of stock of the company bought with the funds of the company).<br\/><br\/>Except as to one or two items, which need not be considered for the present, there is no genuine dispute as to the correctness of the amounts set out in the statement under the various subheads, and both parties appear to accept it as a full and complete statement of the condition of the company, upon which their respective claims may be adjudicated.\u00a0 It will be seen, however, that it does not furnish all the necessary information from which the real earnings of the company can be ascertained, because the value of plant and good will is shown at its cost price, notwithstanding the fact that in the very nature of things the real value of vessels and other plant used in a lighterage business and of the good will of such a business must, year after year, vary widely from the cost price.\u00a0 But in view of the acquiescence of the parties; and since the statement was furnished in the usual way by the company as a basis for the settlement of plaintiff's, claims at the request of plaintiff, who himself had been a member of the <i>junta directiva<\/i> (directing board) and well knew the method adopted by the company in preparing such statements; and since depreciation in the value of the property of the company appears to have been anticipated and provided for by the clauses of the articles of partnership directing the setting aside of a reserve fund and a fund for the amortization of materials; we are of opinion that for the purpose of estimating the amount of earnings of the company to which the plaintiff was entitled on severing his connection with the company, the entry of the property of the company upon the statement at its cost price may be regarded as the method agreed upon by the parties under the terms of the articles of agreement.\u00a0 We shall, therefore, confine ourselves strictly to an examination of the respective contentions of the parties as to the propriety of entering certain specified items among the assets and liabilities of the company, in an inventory prepared for the purpose of ascertaining the profits available for distribution among the partners at the date of the preparation of the inventory.<br\/><br\/>The defendant company insists that the items entered in the list of assets under the head of <i>prima de negocio<\/i> (good will) and \"amortization of shares\" should be stricken out, because, as it is alleged, they represent imaginary and fictitious assets.<br\/><br\/>We can not agree with this contention.\u00a0 The \"good will\" of a business is frequently one of its most valuable assets.\u00a0 The business men who organized Carman &amp; Co. did not hesitate to pay 20,000 pesos for the good will of the business they took over, and the magnificent return which that company was able to make on the money invested by its organizers conclusively demonstrated that the business which they bought was a most valuable one, and that far from being a loss, or an investment in an \"imaginary and fictitious asset,\" the 20,000 pesos invested in the \"good will\" of that business was an extremely profitable transaction for the purchasers.\u00a0 It does not definitely appear from the record whether the good will of the business in the hands of Carman &amp; Co. had increased or diminished in value on the date of the inventory, but this item is set down therein at its cost price, in the same manner as is the original cost price of the lighterage plant, and we think the same reasons which justify the entry of plant at its cost price justify the entry of \"good will\" at its cost price. In any event, the defendant company has no ground for complaint upon that score, for, if, as counsel for defendant company intimates, the \"good will\" of the company has depreciated, it was to cover just such losses that the reserve fund was created, and the defendant company, properly, as we believe, denies plaintiff's claim to any participation therein.<br\/><br\/>As to the item under the head of \"amortization of shares,\" the contention of defendant company is clearly without foundation.\u00a0 This amount was paid out of funds of Carman &amp; Co. for shares held in that company by various persons.\u00a0 If it had not been so expended, these funds would be available for distribution as profits, The company now holds these shares of their equivalent, and the semiannual dividends of each of the partners are proportionately increased by that fact.\u00a0 Manifestly the company is not entitled to retain for itself the benefits accruing from an investment of the earnings of the company, not specifically prescribed in the articles of partnership, and at the same time deny to the outgoing partner his share of the profits invested therein.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff's claims to a share in the reserve fund and the fund for the amortization or depreciation of material present more difficulty. We think, however, that adopting, as we do, the construction which appears to have been placed upon the above-cited articles of partnership by the parties thereto, including the plaintiff himself prior to his withdrawal from the company, these claims must be denied.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with the terms of the articles of partnership, these funds were to be created from earnings or gross profits of the business, and plaintiff insists that, as such, he is entitled to share therein upon his withdrawal from the company.\u00a0 In our opinion, however, the above-cited articles of partnership limited the rights of a partner who withdraws prior to the termination of the ten-year limit therein set out to the withdrawal of his original capital (<i>capital impuesto<\/i>) and the profits to which at the time of his withdrawal he is entitled under the provisions of article 11, and that the exercise of his option to resign carries with it his surrender of all claims to such amount as is carried in these funds in conformity with the provisions of articles 9 and 10.<br\/><br\/>Clearly, it was not the intention of the organizers of the company to permit one of its members to withdraw at his pleasure, and force the company to a liquidation of its business and to the payment of such amount as the outgoing partner would be entitled to receive if the business of the company were wound up as of that date.\u00a0 Such a concession would have been fatal to its stability, and would have placed all of the partners at the mercy of any one partner who desired its dissolution.\u00a0 In section 6, which provides for the voluntary withdrawal of a partner, we find no provision for the payment to the withdrawing partner of anything but his original capital (<i>capital impuesto<\/i>), which is provided for with considerable detail, and yet the partners must have anticipated that at such time there would be in existence funds in which the retiring partner would be entitled to participate if he continued in the company until the end of the term for which it was organized.\u00a0 Without a clear and express agreement in the articles of partnership, authorizing a retiring partner to withdraw earnings which had gone into the reserve funds, we do not think we would be justified in reading into those articles authority so to do, for such a construction would go far to defeat the purpose for which it may be assumed these funds were set aside.<br\/><br\/>The object for which such funds are usually and properly set aside is to protect an enterprise against violent fluctuations in business, unanticipated and unavoidable losses and other untoward incidents of like character.\u00a0 To this end all the parties agree, that in those years wherein the business shows a profit they will lay aside a certain percentage to meet future contingencies, each partner waiving his individual right to receive his portion thereof, until the enterprise is completed. It is a sort of insurance against misfortune, and manifestly the purpose in view would be defeated in large measure were each member of the enterprise at liberty to withdraw at will, and take with him funds set aside in a season of prosperity to tide over possible seasons of adversity. Far from securing to the retiring partners the privilege so to do, the articles of partnership appear to have contemplated the withdrawal by such partners of no more than their original capital (<i>capital impuesto<\/i>) together with any profits which at the time of withdrawal they are entitled to have credited to their account, and clause 11 carefully provides against the distribution of profits without first laying aside the amounts which it was agreed should be placed in the funds in question.<br\/><br\/>But plaintiff contends that no such amount as that credited to the so-called fund for the \"amortization of material\" would be found therein, if it had been duly applied to the \"preservation or renewal\" (<i>conservacion o renovacion<\/i>) of the plant, in accordance with the provisions of clause 10 of the articles of partnership.\u00a0 It appears from the evidence of record that an amount even larger than that credited to this fund was expended in repairs upon the vessels and lighters used by Carman &amp; Co., and plaintiff insists that had the amount credited to this fund been applied to these repairs, that amount would have been left free for distribution as profits.\u00a0 It must be admitted that the language of clause 10 of the articles of partnership, which provides for the creation of this fund, taken by itself, may be construed so as to furnish some ground for this contention.\u00a0 But we think, nevertheless, that construing this article together with the context, in the light of all the circumstances surrounding the execution of the instrument; and keeping in mind the construction given to the articles of partnership by the parties thereto, both at the time of its execution and throughout the period when Carman &amp; Co. was engaged in business, it must be held that this fund (referred to in clause 11 as a discount on account of \"depreciation of material\" or plant) really represented the estimated depreciation in the cost price of the plant, and was intended to be used not for the purpose of keeping up ordinary repairs, but as a sort of sinking fund to balance the anticipated depreciation in the value of the plant.<br\/><br\/>Unlike the reserve fund, which could be deposited or invested in any way the majority of shareholders at the semiannual meetings might deem proper, this fund, set aside on account of the anticipated \"depreciation of the property\" of the company, had for its sole object the \"preservation and renewal\" thereof, and under the articles of partnership could properly be applied for that purpose and no other.\u00a0 There can be no doubt of the wisdom of this provision, for the business of the company was at all times subjected to partial or total disruption by the partial or total loss of its small fleet of vessels in one of the <i>baguios<\/i> which so frequently, play havoc with the shipping in Manila Bay, or in some other unavoidable accident; and the plant was peculiarly subject to losses resulting from the depreciation of the value of the vessels as they became old and unseaworthy.\u00a0 But the expenditure of this fund on ordinary repairs would defeat the wise purpose for which it was originally intended, for in the common experience of men, the mere placing of repairs, as distinguished from improvements, on vessels such as those used by the company, could not preserve them against the depreciation resulting from the lapse of years, nor protect them from the risk of accident and loss to which they are exposed.<br\/><br\/>As a matter of fact the company does not appear to have kept these funds separate and intact as originally contemplated, but an amount of money greater than that which, under the articles, should have been placed in these funds, was invested in new plant and improvements, and the estimated amount of these funds entered on the books as a liability.\u00a0 The plaintiff has no complaint on that score, however, as he himself was a <i>socio colectivo y gerente<\/i> (directing partner) during practically the entire period of the operations of Carman &amp; Co.; and indeed the investment in additional plant and improvements may in a certain sense be regarded, first, as such an investment of the reserve fund as was authorized under clause 9 of the articles, and, second, as an application of the \"amortization of material\" fund for the purpose of \"preserving and renewing\" the property of the company such as was contemplated in clause 10 of said articles.\u00a0 If the investment of funds, properly belonging to the \"reserve\" and \"amortization of material\" funds, in additional plant and improvements be treated as a substantial though informal compliance with the provisions of the articles, it is manifest that in the general statement of the affairs of the company, from which the profits for distribution are to be estimated, the estimated amount of such funds was properly entered as a liability of the company.<br\/><br\/>Throughout the whole period of its existence, Carman &amp; Co., of which the plaintiff was a <i>socio colectivo y gerente<\/i> (directing partner), appears to have treated the amount, which under the articles of partnership should have been placed in these funds, as a \"liability\" of the company; in making repairs, as distinguished from improvements, the company appears to have made use of its available funds on hand, treating repairs as necessary expenses incident to the management and conduct of the business; the amount of these repairs does not appear to have been charged against the fund for \"amortization of material,\" and on the contrary, that fund seems to have been treated as in reality in the nature of an estimated offset for depreciation of cost price of plant and improvements, these items having been carried on the books of the company without variation throughout the period of its existence; and no objection appears to have been made to the company's system of bookkeeping until after plaintiff had withdrawn therefrom.\u00a0 It appears, furthermore, that other partners withdrew from the company prior to plaintiff's withdrawal (including D. M. Carman who gave his name to the company and who, like the plaintiff, was a <i>socio colectivo y gerente<\/i>), and that at the time of the withdrawal of these partners, the interest which they were permitted to withdraw was based on the books of the company, kept in accordance with the general plan above indicated, and that there was no recognition of a claim on the part of the former retiring partners of a share in the \"reserve fund\" or the fund for the \"amortization of material.\"\u00a0 These facts are, of course, by no means conclusive, but they are strongly suggestive of the construction placed by the contracting parties themselves on the articles of partnership under which they were organized and of the intention of the parties in entering into the agreement.<br\/><br\/>We can not say that the articles of partnership are not capable of construction so as to give a different result from that at which we have arrived, but we think the construction we have given them best accords with the intention of the contracting parties, interpreting them more especially in accordance with the provisions of article 1282 of the Civil Code, which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 1282.\u00a0 In order to judge as to the intention of the contracting parties, attention must principally be paid to their acts, contemporaneous and subsequent to the contract.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff is entitled to the amounts set opposite his name on the list of liabilities of the company above set out, to wit, $12,000, Mexican currency, original capital, $16,158.03, Mexican currency, earnings, $363.94, Mexican currency, account-current, and no more, and that he is entitled to judgment therefor, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 1st day of February, 1904, subject, however, to the following deductions:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 A deduction of $9,453.75, Mexican currency, paid August 2, 1904, together with the appropriate incidental deduction of interest charges.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 A further deduction of his admitted share of losses in December, 1903, and January, 1904, overlooked in the original statement, amounting to $454.80, Mexican currency.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 A further deduction of P500, Philippine currency, to which, accepting the findings of the trial court in this regard, we hold the defendant company is entitled on account of damages resulting from the unlawful appointment of a receiver on the application of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Twenty days from the date of this decision let judgment be entered reversing the judgment of the trial court without costs to either party in this instance, and ten days thereafter let the record be returned to the court below, where judgment will be entered for the equivalent in Philippine currency, at the rate of exchange on the day of such judgment, of the amount in Mexican currency to which plaintiff is entitled as above indicated.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres<\/i> and <i>Mapa, JJ<\/i>., concur. <i>Willard, J<\/i>., concurs in the result.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><center><b>DISSENTING<\/b><\/center><br\/><b>ARELLANO, C. J<\/b>.,<br\/><br\/>The doctrine established by the foregoing decision, and set out in the syllabus thereof, is that under the provisions of tfte articles of partnership of the defendant company a partner voluntarily withdrawing from the partnership that was organized in accordance with the said articles is not entitled to withdraw any part of the \"reserve fund\" or the fund for the \"amortization of material.\"<br\/><br\/>I regret to have to differ from the conclusion that sets out such a doctrine, to wit:\u00a0 That in the event of a partial dissolution of a collective limited partnership which possesses, besides the capital contributed by the partners, an increase of capital accumulated in a reserve fund that was created by contributions from the partners, together with part of the profits due them at every balancing of accounts, which they put aside in order to increase the corporate capital, the partner who retires and moves a partial liquidation for the purposes of such dissolution is not entitled to recover such portions of the profits, if any there be, which he had periodically surrendered, in order to create said reserve fund, for the only reason that it is presumed that upon such surrender he waived his right thereto and assigned them to the partnership.\u00a0 In other words, that the reserve fund is corporate capital differing from that originally contributed by the partners; the latter recoverable, if existing, in the event of a partial dissolution of the partnership, while in similar case the former is not, even though such fund exists.<br\/><br\/>In my opinion, the reasons alleged in support of such a doctrine are not convincing.\u00a0 These reasons are:\u00a0 First, that the terms of the articles of partnership limit the right of the retiring partner to the withdrawal of his original capital and such profits as at the time of his withdrawal he is entitled.\u00a0 Second, that the exercise of this right carries with it the surrender, on the part of the retiring partner, of all claims to such amount as is carried in the reserve fund and that for the amortization of material.\u00a0 Third, that clearly it was not the intention of the organizers of the company to permit one of its members to withdraw at his pleasure, and force the company to liquidation of its business, and to the payment of such amount as the outgoing partner would be entitled to receive if the business of the company were wound up as of that date, inasmuch as this would be fatal to the stability of the company.\u00a0 Fourth, that in accordance with clause 6, a retiring partner should not be paid anything but the capital he originally contributed; and, nevertheless, the partners must have foreseen that in such an event there would be funds in existence in which the retiring partner would be entitled to participate if he continued in the company until it was wound up.\u00a0 Fifth, that without an express stipulation in the articles of partnership authorizing a retiring partner to withdraw profits set apart to form the reserve fund, those articles must not be construed as authorizing such withdrawal, as that would frustrate the purpose for which said fund was set aside, that is, to meet contingencies and fluctuations in the business, and to serve as a sort of insurance against unforeseen accidents.\u00a0 \"To this end all the parties agree, that in those years wherein the business shows a profit they will lay aside a certain percentage thereof to meet future contingencies, each partner waiving his individual right to receive his portion thereof, until the enterprise is terminated.\"<br\/><br\/>It should here be stated that this suit is between a retiring partner and the company itself, and that there is no third party in interest as, for example, a creditor of the company; that no ulterior liabilities of the.company were affected by the withdrawal of the said partner, because he was charged with all those that concerned him; and that his withdrawal was authorized by the articles of partnership, and did not appear, nor could it appear as improper to any of the partners.<br\/><br\/>It is also of importance to set forth certain incontestable facts which are hereinafter reproduced, taken from the statements made in the brief of the appellant company.<br\/><blockquote>\"On the 29th of March (1904) Sr. Felix Fanlo, the managing partner of 'Rocha &amp; Co.' wrote a letter to the plaintiff which he signed 'Carman &amp; Co.' and in which he inclosed a copy of the inventory and balance sheet which he said was that of the 31st of January, 1904.\u00a0 He added that the plaintiff's account stood as follows:\u00a0 His share of the capital, $12,000; his share of the profits, $15,878.62; reserve fund, $6,339.60, and that the whole amount would be paid to him in four installments, to wit, the first one six months after his withdrawal, and the remaining installments to be paid at the end of successive periods of six months or before if possible, allowing him interest in the meantime at the rate of 6 per cent per annum.<br\/><br\/>\"The plaintiff in reply stated that he did not agree to the amount set out in the said letter as being his interest in the firm of Carman &amp; Co., because his share in the reserve fund and in the fund for the amortization of material was lacking and had not been taken into account for the purposes of the liquidation.<br\/><br\/>\"On the 29th of July, the manager of Rocha &amp; Co., sent the plaintiff a general statement of accounts and a copy of his account-current, requesting his conformity or comment.\u00a0 To this the plaintiff replied that he did not agree to the said account because the balance shown in it did not accord with that set out by Carman &amp; Co. in their letter of March 29, 1904, in which the sum of $34,218.22 was shown as standing to his credit; he further said that it was necessary to add to said account his share of the fund for the amortization of material which was 'the only point that remained to be cleared up.'<br\/><br\/>\"To this Rocha &amp; Co. replied by letter on August 1, informing the plaintiff among other things that what they had stated in their previous letter of July 29 was only an opinion, and that though the amounts expressed in the letter of March 29 had been taken from the books wherein the funds in question appeared, he should not be governed by that nor by what had been recently done, because it was neither legal nor just, and that in view of the fact that the first installment was due on that day the company was prepared to pay him 'an approximate amount while the doubtful points were being cleared up.'<br\/><br\/>\"On the same date, August 1, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff, saying that 'on the supposition that he had an option on the balance of $34,218.22, there should be deducted $454.80 corresponding to the months of December and January, and in that case the amount payable at the first installment would be $9,453.75, including interest, for which sum they requested him to send his receipt.'\u00a0 The plaintiff sent a receipt for the said amount and collected it.<br\/><br\/>\"As the second installment was about to become due, the defendant sent the plaintiff another statement of accounts which the latter did not accept, and he filed the complaint which gave rise to these proceedings.\" <\/blockquote> As may be seen, the company did not object when its partner Figueras, exercising the faculty accorded him by clause 6, notified it of his intention to retire, and on the 29th of March it had already made the necessary liquidation of the company's capital with a view to the partial rescission of the contract caused by the withdrawal of the said partner, and he was allowed his share of the \"reserve fund\" which amounted to $6,339.60.\u00a0 The company did not fear for the stability of its enterprise when it returned to Figueras his share of the capital, $12,000-nor his share of the profits, $15,872.62-nor his share in the profits held in reserve, that is, of the capital placed in the reserve fund.\u00a0 Consequently, the courts of justice have before them the evidence that the partners, in agreeing upon the contents of clause 6, had the intention, manifestly shown by their acts, upon the withdrawal of a partner before the time specified in the contract, to liquidate the business as though the company was to be wound up altogether, for the purpose of setting aside the portion corresponding to the outgoing partner in the corporate capital, that is to say, in the capital, the profits, and the reserve fund.\u00a0\u00a0 The partners who imposed upon themselves this special law were well aware of what they were stipulating, and what is, on the other hand, provided by the general law, to wit, the Code of Commerce: that the partial rescission of a copartnership shall be preceded by a general liquidation of the whole business up to the time when the interest and responsibility of the outgoing partner ceases.\u00a0 This operation is not an unusual one, nor one that would disturb the regular course of the company's business, inasmuch as the rescission may be subordinated to one of the periodical balancings of accounts so that the participation in favor of and against the retiring partner may be fixed with precision.\u00a0 There is, therefore, no need to tax the mind with interpreting what requires no interpretation, at least from the moment that the acts of the contracting parties themselves clearly demonstrate their intention.<br\/><br\/>Said liquidation, with the letter with which the same was forwarded (Exhibit H), showed a total of $34,218.22 in favor of the outgoing partner, and it was stated in the letter that the payment of that sum would be made in four installments.\u00a0 The outgoing partner accepted the said liquidation, so that there was already the agreement necessary for a valid contract so far as the contents of the liquidation was concerned; but he found out that his share in the \"amortization fund,\" amounting to $50,630.73, had not been liquidated or adjudicated to him, and he set up a claim for it.<br\/><br\/>In the account-current of the 29th of July, which the company submitted to the outgoing partner, the same items were set out on the debit side, to wit: capital, profits, and reserve fund; but by reason of new deductions which the company thought fit to make, the balance of $34,218.22 already accepted, was reduced to $26,227.73.\u00a0 For this reason the account was objected to, and the previous objection regarding the participation that the outgoing partner had in the amortization fund was again put forward, <i>this being the only point that remained to be cleared up.<\/i><br\/><br\/>On the 2d of August, 1904, the company paid the first installment in accordance with the liquidation of March 29 previous, and delivered $9,458.75 to the outgoing partner, \"in which amount the proportional share in the reserve fund was included.\"\u00a0 (B. of E., 24 and 25.)<br\/><br\/>It was only on the 25th of January, 1905, after all of the above acts had been consummated, that the company denied the right of the retiring partner to the \"reserve fund\" and to the fund for \"amortization of material,\" and presented an account-current which showed only $9,524.30 as balance, and it was then that the outgoing partner took the matter to the courts of justice.<br\/><br\/>The liquidation was effected on the 29th of March, 1904, and from that time an account-current was opened and a statement of the same was sent to the creditor Figueras on the 29th of July, 1904, and the 25th of January, 1905.<br\/><br\/>In the light of these facts, which are incontestable, no longer is the share in the fund for the \"amortization of material\" the \"only point that needs to be cleared up;\" there is also the important question of the right to the \"reserve fund.\"<br\/><br\/>That Figueras's right to a portion of his profits was extinguished by a presumed renunciation when the same went to form a part of the \"reserve fund,\" is the most powerful reason given in the foregoing majority, decision.<br\/><br\/>It is not clear whether the renunciation is absolute or temporary; in the beginning of the argument it seems to be the former, but at the close it is said:\u00a0 \"* * * each partner waiving his individual right to receive his portion thereof (the profits) <i>until<\/i> the enterprise is completed.\"\u00a0 But in either case, it can not be understood that there was a presumed renunciation, either as the means by which a person lost his dominion over a thing that was his own and that he has not in any way transmitted to another person, or as operating to prevent the disposal thereof until a given period. It is understood that, the question being between partners as stated in the beginning, no third party is interested therein.<br\/><br\/>The reserve fund in this case has been mistaken for the reserve fund which is <i>characteristic<\/i> of joint-stock companies.<br\/><br\/>In this case we have to deal with a copartnership which originally was a collective company under the style or firm name of \"Carman &amp; Company,\" that admitted various unofficial partners (<i>comanditarios<\/i>) and did not qualify itself as a <i>sociedad en comandita<\/i> as prescribed in the Code of Commerce.\u00a0 Dickerson M. Carman, Francisco T. Figueras, and Jose Vidal were the collective partners and managers.\u00a0 After the organization of the copartnership, one of the unofficial partners, Felix Fanlo, became a collective partner in substitution of Jose Vidal.\u00a0 It was stipulated by the partners in the articles of partnership that any of them could withdraw from the firm by giving notice to the others six months in advance.\u00a0 The collective partner Figueras gave notice on the 31st of January, 1904, of his desire to withdraw; hence the liquidation of March 29,1904, and the successive accounts-current already mentioned.\u00a0 (Facts stated in the complaint and admitted in the answer.)<br\/><br\/>At the time when this firm was organized, December 5, 1898, the Code of Commerce was in full force, and in this code the differentiating characteristics of collective partnerships or <i>sociedades en comandita<\/i>, and joint-stock companies are very elemental.\u00a0 In the first-named, the personal element constitutes the essential thing, hence the necessity for a firm name, while in the latter the real element is essential, and for said reason a corporate name is sufficient; the former consist of an association of persons, and the latter of an association of capital.<br\/><br\/>With the former the element of credit is the name of the collective partners and managers: \"all the members of the general copartnership, be they or be they not managing partners of the same, are personally and jointly liable with all their property for the results of the transactions made in the name and for the account of the partnership, under the signature of the latter, and by a person authorized to make use thereof.\"\u00a0 (Art. 127.)<br\/><br\/>With the latter the liability of the members for the obligations and losses shall be limited to the <i>funds<\/i> they contributed or bound themselves to contribute to the corporate capital.\u00a0 (Art. 153.)\u00a0 And although the responsibility of unofficial partners is equally limited, it is nevertheless essential in this class of copartnerships to respond for transactions conducted exclusively by others called collective partners who are personally and jointly liable with all their property just the same as in the case of general partnerships.<br\/><br\/>On this supposition, if there were collective partners of the firm of \"Carman &amp; Co.\" and these were liable with all their property, even with such as was not brought into the copartnership, a reserve fund agreed upon between its partners for particular uses or employment within the same, that is to say, a gradual increase of capital, can not constitute a kind of insurance against unforeseen accidents, if outside of it and over and above the whole capital the property of the general partners was held as a reserve for joint liability.<br\/><br\/>If during the year 1899, the first year of its operation, one of the partners had at the end of six months given notice of his intention to withdraw at the end of said year, and if his share in the profits amounted to 1,000 pesos, out of which 200 or 100 would have gone to the reserve fund if he had continued in the partnership, the delivery of the entire amount of his 1,000 pesos could not have been denied him, nor could he have been compelled to contribute to such reserve fund in which he would no longer take any interest; there was no longer any reason for him to care for the stability of the partnership once he had withdrawn from the same.\u00a0 Had it been stipulated between the partners that out of the capital contributed by each of them, 10 per cent was to be set aside as a reserve fund to be exclusively devoted to the purchase of vessels, upon any of them withdrawing from the copartnership before the expiration of the term agreed upon the said 10 per cent could not have been retained as a reserve fund.\u00a0 The reserve fund, which is an unusual thing in the case of collective copartnerships, does not mean an increase in the securities, inasmuch as the supreme security rests on all the property, even that which has not been brought into the business; it only means an increase of capital.\u00a0 The same thing would happen if some of the members, in addition to the capital contributed by them, loaned a certain amount to the company for the purpose of forming a reserve fund for some particular object; upon their retiring from the copartnership and withdrawing their capital, they would also withdraw the sums invested in objects in which they no longer had any interest, unless it had been stipulated that they would be kept by the firm as a loan for a fixed or specified period of time.<br\/><br\/>With respect to joint-stock companies, there was a time, previous to the enforcement of the present Code of Commerce, when by reason of a special law that governed them they were compelled to maintain a reserve fund which was strictly legal, over and above the will of the stockholders.\u00a0 It had to consist of not less,than 10 per cent of the corporate capital.\u00a0 It was not constituted out of what the stock-holders paid into the company, but out of the profits that they did not receive, and in order to constitute the same it was necessary that there should be profits out of some transaction, as otherwise it could not be formed.\u00a0 It was not necessary to establish it at once, even though there should be sufficient profits therefor, but the portion designated in the articles of incorporation was set aside and gradually applied thereto.\u00a0 If after it had been formed there was a decrease, it was necessary to replace it at once; not gradually, in the manner in which it was formed, but by applying all of such portion of the profits as was required, without distributing anything to the stockholders until it was completed.<br\/><br\/>All the considerations set forth in the majority decision properly apply to the above legal reserve fund.\u00a0 The said legal reserve fund, that is to say, that imposed by law on all joint-stock companies subject to its provisions, had as its object an increase of the securities by adding to the capital a portion of the profits in order to meet with them also the fulfillment of corporate obligations.\u00a0 Although it was formed out of that portion of the profits which each stock-holder failed to receive it belonged to all in general; it was not disposed of privately, nor was it represented by shares as was the corporate capital.\u00a0 It lasted as long as did the company, and if at its expiration there was no need to apply it to the payment of debts it was divided up and distributed in the same proportion by which it had been formed.<br\/><br\/>But nothing of all this is applicable to a purely conventional reserve fund such as was agreed upon between the partners of this general copartnership or <i>sociedad en comandita<\/i>, one which is not divided up into shares, but with fixed capitals.\u00a0 There enters nothing that has been imposed by the law, nor is this a joint-stock company wherein the only liability and guaranty is the capital and the reserve fund.<br\/><br\/>Besides this legal consideration there is yet another, based on proven facts which are thus considered in the judgment appealed from:\u00a0 \"Instead of using the amounts accumulated as a 'reserve fund' for the purchase or acquisition, of new vessels to continue the business, and other purposes devoted to this end, sums also taken from the general profits resulting from the respective balances were applied to such purposes; such payments were charged to 'profit and loss,' that is, deducting said amounts from the earnings or from the profits that were periodically divided up between the partners, and in exchange the 'reserve fund' and the 'amortization fund' remained intact.\"\u00a0 (B. of E., 27.)\u00a0 Twice did the partners sacrifice their share of the profits, and neither of such profits can now be recovered by the outgoing partner.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, it is my opinion that, besides the three amounts that are adjudicated to the plaintiff by the majority decision, to wit: $12,000 as capital; $16,158.03 as profits; and $868.94 on his account-current, the following should be added:<br\/><blockquote><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr> <td width=\"64%\">For his share of the reserve fund........................<\/td> <td width=\"36%\">$6,339.60<\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td>For his share of the amortization fund.................. <\/td> <td>17,720.75<\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table><\/blockquote>In addition to the three items contained in the decision, there should be deducted the sum of $4,000, which the judgment appealed from deducts as the share of the appellee in the good will of the business ($20,000).<br\/><br\/>With regard to the first item added, that of $10,095 fixed in the judgment appealed from, although well founded on the contract, I do not consider acceptable, for the reason that in the appellee's answer to the letter which contained the liquidation of the 29th of March, 1904, he had already agreed to the item which, as his share in the \"reserve fund,\" had been assigned to him in the said liquidation and set out in his account-current; <i>this amount<\/i> was fixed by the appellee in his complaint on the 26th of January, 1906.\u00a0 (B. of E., 4.)<br\/><br\/>With respect to the second item, that is, the share that according to the judgment appealed from is due to the appellee out of the \"amortization fund,\" I consider that the reasons supporting the adjudication of the said sum to the appellee are in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>The further deduction of $4,000 is made in the judgment appealed from, and it has not been appealed from by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Finally, as to the equivalence of Mexican pesos to Philippine pesos, I adhere to the decision of the majority.<br\/><br\/>With the foregoing modification, I vote for the affirmation of the judgment, without any special ruling as to the costs of this instance.<br\/><\/div>",

The justice of the peace rendered a judgment against the defendants, and in favor of the plaintiff upon the 9th day of February, 1909.<br\/><br\/>On the 18th day of March, 1909, the justice of the peace issued a writ of execution upon said judgment.<br\/><br\/>On the 22d day of March, 1909, the sheriff returned said execution, stating that he had  been unable to satisfy the same.<br\/><br\/>On the 23d day of March, 1909, the plaintiff appeared in the office of the sheriff and insisted that the sheriff should levy said execution upon a house of mixed materials, which she alleged belonged to the defendant, Blas Francisco.  The sheriff refused to levy the execution upon said house for the reason that in his opinion said house was not worth P150, calling the plaintiff's attention to section 452 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.<br\/><br\/>On the 27th day of March, 1909, the plaintiff filed her petition in this court, asking that a writ of mandamus be issued, directing the sheriff to levy said execution.  To the petition of the plaintiff the defendant filed an answer setting up substantially the foregoing facts.  Later, upon the questions of fact presented by the petition and answer, the parties submitted their proofs.<br\/><br\/>An examination of the proof adduced shows that Blas Francisco was the owner of a house of mixed materials, a part of which rented for P8 per month.  Aside from this proof showing the rental value of said property, there was no proof whatever relating to the value of said house.  Neither did the proof show that the house was located upon the land of the said Blas Francisco.  Neither did the proof show that the said Bias Francisco was the owner of any other property whatever.<br\/><br\/>This court has decided in the case of Petersen <i>vs.<\/i> Peterson (No. 2360)<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> and in the case of Manotoc <i>vs.<\/i> McMicking (10 Phil. Rep., 119) that \"A writ of mandamus is not available to compel a sheriff to execute an attachment against a specific piece of property when the writ of attachment is issued in general terms against the property of the debtor.\"<br\/><br\/>It is questionable whether it is the duty of a sheriff, when he has an execution to serve, to present the objection that the property of the judgment debtor is exempt from execution.  The exemption provided for by the law is a right accorded to debtors, and a right which must be insisted upon or it may be lost.  It would therefore seem to be the duty of the sheriff, whenever he finds property belonging to a judgment debtor, when he has an execution to serve, to serve said execution upon said property and allow the judgment debtor to claim his right under the statute.  That question, however, is not presented here.<br\/><br\/>The sheriff, in the present case, took the execution issued by the justice of the peace and attempted to find property subject to execution, belonging to the judgment debtor.  In his return he states that he was unable to find any property of the defendant subject to execution.  In doing this, the sheriff complied with the duty imposed upon him by the law.  If, through his negligence or carelessness, he failed to find property subject to execution, and if through such negligence or carelessness the judgment creditor suffered loss, such judgment creditor would have a right of action against the sheriff and his bondsmen for such negligence, and as was pointed out in the case of Manotoc <i>vs.<\/i> McMicking (10 Phil. Rep., 119) the judgment creditor has another remedy, under sections 474 and 482 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.  There being other remedies sufficiently adequate, the plaintiff is clearly not entitled to a writ of mandamus in the present case.  The prayer of the petition is, therefore, hereby denied, with costs.  It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

From this sentence of the lower court the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>At the time of his appeal to the Supreme Court, to secure his liberty during the pendency of the appeal the following bond was executed and delivered by the defendant, Lagrimas, and the plaintiffs, Bandoy and Salamanca:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Whereas in the above-entitled cause judgment was rendered on the 9th of September, 1907, whereby this Court of First Instance sentenced the accused, Felix de Lagrimas, to the penalty of two months and one day of <i>arresto<\/i> and to pay a fine of 1,300 pesetas or P260, and the costs of the proceedings;<br\/><br\/>\"Whereas the said accused, Felix de Lagrimas, has appealed from said judgment to the Supreme Court and prays that liberty be given him on  bail during the pendency of his appeal;<br\/><br\/>\"Whereas the said bail was fixed in the sum of P1,000 Philippine currency:<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, we, Vicenta Salamanca and Vicente Bandoy, both being of age, landowners, and residents of the municipality of Santa Cruz, La Laguna, Philippine Islands, hereby engage that the accused, Felix de Lagrimas, will pay any fine that the court upon appeals may impose upon him, or, will deliver himself up in order to undergo the penalty that may be ordered by the said court, or, in the event of a new trial, that he will appear before the tribunal called upon to try him, and will submit to such orders and process as the court may prescribe; and that in case of a conviction he will appear to hear sentence and surrender himself for the execution thereof; and in case of failure to comply with any of the foregoing obligations, we engage to pay the Government of the United States the sum of P1,000 Philippine currency.<br\/><br\/>\"Santa Cruz, La Laguna, 14th of September, 1907.<br\/><br\/>\"(Signed) Vicenta Salamanca.\u2014(Signed) Vicente Bandoy.\u2014 hereby consent that Do\u00f1a Vicenta Salamanca, my wife, execute the foregoing bond.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>On the 15th day of August, 1908, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Lagrimas, 11 Phil. Rep., 641) and returned the cause to the lower court for the execution of said sentence.  Later (the exact date not appearing of record) the defendant (Lagrimas) surrendered himself to the custody of the court for the purpose of serving said sentence.  Said penalty of imprisonment was duly served by said Lagrimas, as appears by his affidavit (see bill of exceptions, p. 9).  It also appears of record that the defendant (Lagrimas) offered to suffer subsidiary imprisonment for the purpose of liquidating said fine of P260.  This  offer of the defendant was not accepted by the authorities and at the expiration of the period of imprisonment, Lagrimas was released from prison.<br\/><br\/>Later the fiscal of the Province of La Laguna presented the following motion:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The undersigned fiscal hereby declares\u2014<br\/><br\/>\"That the accused in the above-entitled cause has undergone the corporal penalty imposed by this court and affirmed by the honorable Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>\"That upon the accused Felix de Lagrimas having been required to pay the fine to the payment of which he was also sentenced, he stated that he was insolvent.<br\/><br\/>\"In view of the foregoing and in conformity with the provisions of section 65 of General Orders, No. 58, and with the terms of the bond  given by the accused, which appears at folios 18 and 19 of the record, I pray the court to issue an order of execution against the bondsmen Vicenta Salamanca and Vicente Bandoy for the purpose of recovering from them the sum of two hundred and sixty pesos (P260) Philippine currency, the amount of the fine imposed upon the accused, and in addition thereto the costs of the proceedings in both instances.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>Upon a full consideration of said motion the judge of the Court of First Instance rendered the following decree:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"In conformity with the request of the fiscal in the foregoing motion, the clerk of the court is hereby directed to issue an order of execution against the bondsmen Vicenta Salamanca and Vicente Bandoy requiring them to pay the sum of two hundred and sixty pesos (P260) Philippine currency, the amount of the fine imposed upon the accused Felix de Lagrimas.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The plaintiffs in the present action being informed of the foregoing decree, presented the following petition:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"I.  That we have been informed that on the 23d of November, 1908, this court directed the clerk to issue an execution against us to enforce the payment of the sum of P260, the amount of the fine imposed upon Felix de Lagrimas, for whom we are bondsmen, plus the costs of both instances.<br\/><br\/>\"II.  That we believe that said order was given in view of the fact that after Felix de Lagrimas had served the sentence imposed upon him in the said cause, he had no money with which to pay the fine and costs ordered in the judgment.<br\/><br\/>\"III.  That the crime for which the said Felix de Lagrimas was sentenced is a crime that is punished by the Penal Code now in force.<br\/><br\/>\"IV.  That according to article 50 of the said code, in connection with article 49 of the same, when the person sentenced has no property to satisfy the pecuniary liabilities, 'he shall be subject to a personal subsidiary liability at the rate of one day for every twelve and a half pesetas,' under the rules provided by said article 50, so that by the action of the law the fine and costs may be, and should be, exchanged for  the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and <i>the liability therefor rests exclusively with the culprit<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"V.  That section 76 of General Orders, No. 58, the only one throughout the same dealing with cases where a bond for the temporary release of an accused person in a criminal case should be executed, and is the law in force on this matter, does not enumerate among the said cases the failure to pay the fine and costs.<br\/><br\/>\"VI.  That  we, the bondsmen who subscribe this petition, can and will surrender Felix de Lagrimas whenever required so to do, in order to undergo the said subsidiary imprisonment, and he on his part is ready to submit thereto, as shown by his annexed affidavit.<br\/><br\/>\"VII.  That an execution upon our bond, as ordered by the court, is not the proper procedure, even if  the bond is to be enforced, inasmuch as we, the bondsmen, are deprived of the right to defend ourselves and to set forth our reasons; it is unconstitutional because such judicial compulsion amounts to a confiscation of property without due process of law, contrary to the provisions of section 5 of the Philippine Bill.<br\/><br\/>\"In view of the foregoing, we pray the court to revoke the aforesaid order.<br\/><br\/>\"Santa Cruz, La Laguna, P. I., December 19, 1908.<br\/><br\/>\"(Signed) Vicente  Bandoy.\u2014(Signed) Vicenta Salamanca.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>Upon a due consideration of the foregoing petition, the lower court rendered the following judgment:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The writing presented by the bondsmen Vicente Bandoy and Vicenta Salamanca on the 19th of December, 1908, involves a petition which, if granted, would result in the amendment of the judgment entered by this court, in view of the fact  that no provision is made therein with regard to the insolvency of the accused in the payment of the fine and costs.  And considering that the said judgment has been fully affirmed by the honorable Supreme Court, the same should and must be executed in all its parts.<br\/><br\/>\"The petition contained in the said writing of the 19th of December, 1908, is hereby denied, and by virtue thereof the order of execution of the 3d of December, 1908, shall stand.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>Against this decree of the lower court the bondsmen, Vicente Bandoy and Vicenta Salamanca, duly excepted and appealed to this court.  In this court the appellants made the following assignment of error:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"One only-an error of law, to wit:  <i>the action of said judge in issuing the order to enforce the bond executed by the appellants.\"<\/i><br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>Section 67 of General Orders, No. 58, gives the form of a bail bond  in criminal cases.  Said form is as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 67.  All personal bail bonds <i>must be executed by a written undertaking<\/i> executed by at least two sufficient sureties (with or without the defendant, as the court * * * may demand) and duly acknowledged, <i>in substantially the following form<\/i>:<br\/><br\/>\"'A complaint (or information) having been filed on the ______ day of _______, 190___, in the court of________ Province  of _________ charging (name of defendant) with the offense of (designating it generally) and he having been admitted to bail in the sum of_______ pesos:<br\/><br\/>\" 'Now, therefore, we, _________ and___________of _________jointly and severally, hereby undertake that the above (naming the defendant) will appear and answer the charge above mentioned in whatever court it may be tried, and will at all times hold himself amenable to the orders and process of the court, and if convicted will appear for judgment, and render himself to the execution thereof; or if he fails to perform any of these conditions, that he will pay to the United States the sum of___________pesos (inserting the sum to which the defendant shall be admitted to bail).<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">(Signed) \"'_______________<br\/>\"' ______________<br\/>\"'______________'\"<\/div><\/blockquote><br\/>Upon an examination of the bond required of the defendant to secure his liberty during the pendency of his appeal to the Supreme Court, it will be noted that said  nd contained the following provision:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"We hereby engage that the accused, Felix de Lagrimas, will pay any fine that the court of appeals may impose upon him.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>This condition of the bond not only required the bondsmen to deliver the body of the defendant (Lagrimas) to the custody of the court to receive whatever sentence the Supreme Court might render, but it also required said bondsmen to pay whatever fine which might be imposed upon the defendant (Lagrimas).  The bond provided for by section 67 of General Orders, No. 58, contained no such provision. The obligation of the bond for admission to bail during the trial of a criminal case is that the person admitted to liberty \"will appear and answer the charge preferred against him in whatever court the cause may be brought and will, at all times, hold himself amenable to the orders and process of the court.\"  The bondsmen, under the form of bond provided for by law, are only obligated to deliver the body of the person admitted to bail to the custody of the court for the purpose of receiving the orders and processes of the court.  The defendant in the present case was entitled to bail as a matter of right, in accordance with the provisions of sections 63 and 64 of General Orders, No. 58 (as amended by sees. 35 and 36 of Act No. 1627 of the law relating to justices of the peace), as well as by the provisions of section 5 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902. The only obligation imposed upon the defendant, under the provisions of the law (sec. 67 of General Orders, No. 58) when he is granted his liberty during the pendency of the cause of action against him, is that he will deliver himself to the custody of the court whenever he is called upon so to do, for the purpose of receiving the orders and processes of the court.  The obligation imposed upon the bondsmen can not be greater nor of a different character.  To permit the imposition of other obligations upon the defendant in criminal actions and upon his bondsmen, for the purpose of securing his liberty under  bail, than those provided for by law might result in the imposition of conditions which would absolutely prevent and render it impossible for the defendant to secure his liberty during the  trial, notwithstanding the fact that he is entitled to his liberty, as a matter of right.  Such a doctrine might result in the  imposition of excessive bail, which is prohibited by law.  (See Philippine Bill, sec, 5; The Act of Congress of July 1, 1902.)  Where the form of the bond for the purpose of admitting a defendant in a criminal case to liberty during the pendency of the action is prescribed by law, such form must be followed in substance.  The authorities  can not impose a greater obligation than that prescribed by such form.  The authorities can not vary its terms, so as to impose upon the defendant and his bondsmen greater obligations.  (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Sauer, 73 Fed. Rep., 671.)<br\/><br\/>The obligation, therefore, imposed upon the bondsmen in the present case, to pay the fine, in addition to the obligation to deliver the body of the defendant to the custody of the court, is void and of no effect.  The bondsmen relieved themselves of all obligation when they delivered the body of the defendant to the custody of the court.<br\/><br\/>Therefore the judgment of the lower court against the appellants herein (Bandoy and Salamanca) is hereby reversed, without any finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

and it was suggested at the hearing that this defendant was dead and that\u00a0 no legal representative had been appointed for his estate.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge thereupon directed plaintiff to elect whether he would proceed against the defendant upon whom summons had been duly served, and who was then present in court, or amend his pleadings so as to bring in a duly appointed legal representative of the estate of the deceased; and plaintiff having elected the latter course, the case was continued on his motion, and a formal order entered, wherein the hearing was continued until \"the first day of the October term,\" and the plaintiff formally directed to amend his pleadings, and to bring in as defendant the legal representative of the defendant whose death had been suggested.<br\/><br\/>The case was set down in the October calendar for the 13th day of that month, and notice of that fact mailed to the parties and their counsel; and, when called on that day, the defendant who had originally been served with notice, appeared in open court, announced himself ready for trial, and prayed the court to dismiss\u00a0 the action because of the absence of plaintiff and his counsel, and because the record disclosed that plaintiff had neglected to prosecute his action by amending the pleadings and bringing, in the legal representative of the estate of the defendant whose death had been suggested at the July term.<br\/><br\/>Upon this motion the trial judge dismissed the complaint, in the exercise of the discretion confered upon him in section 127 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which is as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"An action may be dismissed, with costs to the defendant, in the following cases:<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 By the court, when the plaintiff fails to appear at the time of trial,\u00a0 and the defendant appears and asks for the dismissal;<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 By the court, when the plaintiff fails, for an unreasonable length of time, to prosecute his action.<br\/><br\/>\"In either of these three cases a dismissal of the action shall not be a bar to another action for the same cause.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>Thereafter a motion for a continuance was filed by counsel for the plaintiff, and later a motion for reinstatement of the action upon the calendar, both of which were denied, whereupon this appeal was duly perfected.<br\/><br\/>The facts above set out leave no room for doubt that in dismissing the complaint on the motion\u00a0 of the defendant, the trial court did no more than the above-cited provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure expressly authorized him to do, and no excuse or explanation being forthcoming at the time when the case was set for trial, of the absence of plaintiff and his counsel, and of the failure of plaintiff to prosecute his\u00a0 action by amending his pleadings in accordance with the previous order of the court and the facts developed in the record, the order of dismissal was properly entered.\u00a0 Hence the only question for consideration is whether the trial judge erred in the exercise of his discretion in refusing to reinstate the case upon the calendar in the light of the explanations and excuses submitted together with the motions for reinstatement and continuance.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for plaintiff stated that their absence from the hearing set for the 13th of October was due to the fact that notice that the case was set for that day on the October calendar did not reach them until the evening of the 12th of October (when it was delivered through the mails at their office in Manila), so that thereafter it was physically impossible for them to reach the Court of First Instance in Batangas in time for the hearing; and they attempted to excuse their failure to amend the pleadings so as to bring in the legal representative of the deceased defendant,\u00a0 by stating that it had been impracticable to secure the necessary data upon which to base an application for the appointment of a representative of the estate of the deceased.<br\/><br\/>We agree with the trial judge that these explanations and excuses are unsatisfactory; and certainly they are not sufficient to sustain a finding that the trial court committed reversible error in declining\u00a0 to accept them as a ground upon which to rest an order reinstating the action upon the register.<br\/><br\/>Where an alleged aggrieved party prays for the setting aside of a final judgment lawfully entered against him, on the ground of accident or surprise, it must appear that there was \"accident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against, and by reason of which the party applying has probably been impaired in his rights.\" (Subsec. 1 of sec. 145, Code of Civil Procedure.)\u00a0 Clearly the exercise of the most ordinary prudence by the plaintiff in this action would have guarded against the alleged surprise of which his counsel now complain.\u00a0 As will be seen from the facts hereinbefore set out, a hearing upon the action was expressly set for the first day of the October term in a formal order, entered on the 21st day of July, 1908, and it is admitted that plaintiff and counsel were duly notified thereof upon the day of its issue.\u00a0 It was their duty, therefore, in the absence of notice of a change of the date of the hearing, to appear on the first day of the October term and take such action as may have been proper or necessary in the furtherance of their demand.\u00a0 This they failed to do, and had the action been dismissed then and there, they would have had no cause to complain.\u00a0 Nor have they any just cause of complaint in the fact that the hearing was continued on the October calendar until a later day, upon which, in their continued absence, it was dismissed; the effect of the continuance being merely to give them an unasked for opportunity to repair their negligence or oversight in failing to appear on the day originally set for the hearing.<br\/><br\/>It is true, as appears from their affidavits, that counsel did not receive\u00a0 notice at their offices in Manila of the continuance of the day of the hearing, from the first day of the October term until the 13th day October, in time to make it possible for them after receiving this notice to make the journey to Batangas before the 13th of October, but the case having been set by order of the court for the first day of the term they were not entitled, <i>as of right<\/i>, to written notice of a continuance of the hearing to a later day of the same term; and the fact that notice was forwarded to them does not give them a just cause of complaint even if it failed to reach them in time to make it possible for them to be present on the new date set for the hearing; for, as has been said, the failure to serve such notice altogether could not have resulted in their surprise or mistake as to the day to which the hearing was continued, had they been present on the day originally set therefor.\u00a0 In view of the uncertainty which sometimes attends the holding of terms of the\u00a0 provincial Courts of First Instance, and the difficulties and inconveniences which burden communication and travel in these Islands, we might be disposed to take a more lenient view of the failure of plaintiff and his counsel to appear on the first day of the term, if it were shown that in good faith they had intended to appear at the October term, and prosecute their action, and through inadvertence or misunderstanding, had mistaken the day set for the trial; but the fact that, when the case was called for trial after the term had begun, the pleadings had not been perfected so as to make it practicable for them to go forward with the trial, and the further\u00a0 fact that when notice of the date finally set for hearing came to their hands, they merely mailed a motion for a continuance until the succeeding term, without assigning any sufficient reason therefor, and took no further steps until they learned that the complaint had been dismissed, convince us that having neglected and failed to perfect their pleadings in compliance with the order of the court, it was not their intention to appear to prosecute the action at the October term, and that they recklessly relied upon the generosity of their adversary and the liberality of the court to relieve them from the danger of dismissal of their action to which such conduct exposed them.<br\/><br\/>We think also that the trial judge properly declined to accept the statement of counsel that it had been impracticable to secure the appointment of a legal representative of the estate of the deceased defendant before the date set for the hearing of the case at the October term.\u00a0 As he well says, the time allowed for that purpose, from the 21st of July to the 13th of October, was amply sufficient for that purpose, in the absence of very exceptional circumstances, and there is nothing in the record or in the affidavits accompanying the motion for reinstatement which indicates that such exceptional circumstances existed in this case.<br\/><br\/>The order of dismissal appealed from should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

under no pretext or excuse shall he divert, sell, or cede to another person the least portion of the sugar that he may harvest.<br\/><br\/>Seventh.\u00a0 The creditor company binds itself to pay Majinay for each shipment of sugar the market value ruling at the time of such delivery, but if at such time another purchaser should offer a higher price than the company is prepared to give, then the latter, for the good of the interests of Majjnay, may sell it to the highest purchaser for account and order of the debtor.<br\/><br\/>Eighth.\u00a0 The debtor, Majinay, shall have the right to wait for higher prices, but the sugar must be stored in such warehouse as the creditor company may designate, in which case storage and insurance shall be paid to the said company at the rate of 1\u00bd centavos per picul per month; such storage, however, shall only last <i>until June 30,1902,<\/i> when all the sugar must be sold, and the accounts and obligations contracted by virtue of this agreement must be liquidated and settled.<br\/><br\/>Ninth.\u00a0 In any case, the debtor, Basilio Majinay, shall pay the said company a commission of 1 per cent on all sugar delivered, whether in Negros or in Iloilo.<br\/><br\/>Eleventh.\u00a0 In addition to the credit for $5,000 opened, the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos binds itself to pay one-third of the value of each shipment of sugar delivered in this market or in the Island of Negros, in order that the debtor, Majinay, may continue to harvest the sugar on the said hacienda.<br\/><br\/>Twelfth.\u00a0 As security for the faithful compliance with this contract, the debtor, Majinay, hereby assigns and pledges the fruits and crops of the said haciendas \"Basag\" and \"Cadujaan,\" and forthwith makes free and unconditional delivery of the same to the creditor company (<i>longa manu tradere<\/i>), transmitting to said company the full ownership thereof until the debtor shall have paid his debt in the form and manner herein stated; in case he fails so to do, the said company is hereby authorized to take possession of said fruits and crops, and either sell or store the same, and to this end, and by virtue of this document, Majinay confers on the company ample, sufficient, and unlimited powers, undertaking to hold as binding everything that the said company may do by virtue thereof, and not to protest in any manner.<br\/><br\/>Thirteenth.\u00a0 Without prejudice to the agreements contained in the preceding clauses, the debtor, Majinay, <i>especially and particularly mortgages<\/i>, to the creditor company <i>in order to better guarantee<\/i> the fulfillment of this contract, four parcels of land, the situation, area, and boundaries of which are described; the said parcels of land form the hacienda called \"Basag,\" whereon there is a sugar mill, a warehouse, and furnaces with their corresponding sugar-boiling pans.\u00a0 The land was acquired by <i>composicion<\/i> with the Government by virtue of the title No. 6090, issued by the <i>direccion general de administracion civil<\/i> on the 15th of June, 1892, entered at the <i>inspeccion general de montes<\/i>, on the 18th of said month and year, and registered in the registry of property of Bacolod on the 1st of May, 1893.<br\/><br\/>In the said instrument it further appears that Basilio Majinay declared that the above described hacienda and its dependencies and buildings are free from all encumbrance; that he is wholly entitled to the fruits thereof; and that prior to this time he has not sold or mortgaged the same to any person whatever.\u00a0 He authorizes the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos, in case of noncompliance with part or the whole of the contract, to institute judicial or extrajudicial proceedings against the mortgaged hacienda, and he forthwith waives all right of action that might hinder any proceedings that the creditor company might institute for the recovery of its credit, or the interest thereon, as above related.<br\/><br\/>Besides the capital and interest hereinbefore mentioned, the above-described hacienda shall be liable for a mortgage credit of $1,000, Mexican currency, with which Majinay charges it for the payment of any costs and charges which the creditor company might incur in the event of having to institute judicial proceedings for recovery.\u00a0 Both parties fix the value of the mortgaged property at the sum of $2,000, Mexican currency; therefore, they waive their right to ask for a new appraisal and to all actions directed to such a purpose.<br\/><br\/>It also appears that Majinay acknowledges the receipt of $5,000, Mexican currency, the total amount of the credit granted him by the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos, and which sum was delivered at the time by Wenceslao Paris for the purposes and in the manner aforesaid in a check, No. 3729, on the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino of Manila, etc.\u00a0 This instrument appears as having been recorded in the registry of property on May 14, 1901, according to the note by the registrar, Manuel Lopez, and sealed with the seal of the registry of property of Occidental Negros.<br\/><br\/>On the 3d of June, 1907, Ricardo Nolan filed a written complaint against Basilio Majinay alleging that on May 3, 1901, the latter had executed in favor of the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos, represented by Wenceslao Paris y Sala, the preceding instrument of loan for the sum of 5,000 pesos with interest thereon at the rate of 9 per cent per annum, in addition to 1,000 pesos for the payment of costs and charges in the event of judicial proceeding being resorted to for the recovery of the said mortgage credit; that on the 30th of June, 1905, the defendant Majinay was indebted to the said company in the sum of P6,059.05 at 9 per cent interest per annum, which amount and the interest thereon have not been paid by the defendant either in whole or in part, notwithstanding the demands made upon him therefor, and in spite of the fact that the creditor company has fulfilled all the obligations stated in the contract; that on October 25, 1905, the head of the company's branch office in Iloilo delivered to Alejandro Montelibano y Ramos, among other credits, that against defendant Majinay for its collection with interest counting from the 1st of July of said year; that on August 3, 1906, another manager of the same branch office of Iloilo, transferred by means of a public instrument to the said Montelibano y Ramos all of the rights and actions pertaining to the creditor company, with the condition that the assignee, Montelibano, was in turn authorized to assign his rights and actions to a third person, which in fact lie did in favor of the present plaintiff Nolan by means of a public instrument dated February 20, 1907; defendant Majinay was duly notified of the transfer made by the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos to Montelibano, and of that by the latter to the plaintiff herein, and that no other person has, or pretends to have any title to the mortgaged property.\u00a0 Therefore, in conclusion he prays that judgment be rendered ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of P6,059.05, with interest thereon at 9 per cent per annum from the 1st of July, 1905, and P1,000 in addition for costs and charges, and that the defendant be warned that if he should fail to deposit the said amounts in the court at the disposal of the plaintiff on or before the first day of the term of court following the rendition of judgment, the mortgaged property will be sold to comply with the obligation to which the complaint refers, and for any other remedy which might be considered just and equitable.<br\/><br\/>On the 3d of June, 1907, the defendant answered the complaint and denied each and every one of the facts therein stated with the exception of those set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3, which he admitted to be in harmony with the interpretation that should be given to contracts; as special defense he alleged that during the term fixed in the contract the defendant complied faithfully with the obligation to deliver sugar to the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos; that notwithstanding the fact that he requested a liquidation of accounts in order to comply with the stipulation in clause 8 of the contract, the creditor company had not liquidated the accounts and canceled the obligations on the 30th of June, 1902, and accounts subsequent to that date should be the subject of another action, and by reason of the said liquidation and cancellation not having been made on the said 30th of June, 1902, the defendant suffered prejudice; therefore, reserving his right to claim therefor, he asked that the complaint be dismissed and that the plaintiff be compelled to liquidate accounts up to the 30th of June, the date on which the contract ended, and that the plaintiff be sentenced to pay the costs and other expenses occasioned the defendant by the complaint.<br\/><br\/>On the same day (July 3) the plaintiff presented a writing in which he denied all and each of the facts alleged by the defendant in his special defense as contained in his answer to the complaint above referred to.<br\/><br\/>The case was brought up for trial, evidence was adduced by both parties, the testimony of their witnesses was taken, and the documents exhibited by them were made of record.\u00a0 After hearing the evidence the court authorized the presentation of additional proofs; this ruling was objected to by the defendant, but his objection was overruled, to which overruling the defendant again excepted.\u00a0 Thereupon the plaintiff offered additional evidence, and the defendant also presented counterproofs.\u00a0 On the 30th of January, 1908, the court below rendered judgment and sentenced the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of P6,059.05, with interest thereon at the rate of 9 per cent per annum from July 1, 1905, and interest at 6 per cent per annum on the overdue and unpaid amount of interest, together with Pl,000 more for costs and charges, warning the defendant that unless he deposited the said amounts with the clerk of the court on or before the first day of the following regular term, the mortgaged property described in the mortgage instrument which appears as Exhibit 3 of the plaintiff would be sold.\u00a0 Against the said judgment the defendant excepted and moved for a new trial on the ground that the conclusions therein were manifestly and openly contrary to the weight of the evidence; his motion was overruled, to which overruling the petitioner excepted.\u00a0 It also appears that upon the request of the plaintiff the court below ordered the deposit of the mortgaged property because there was danger that the products of the haciendas \"Basag\" and \"Cadujaan\" would be lost or would disappear; to said order the defendant excepted and presented the corresponding bill of exceptions which having been approved, was submitted to this court.<br\/><br\/>The questions set up in this litigation by reason of the appeal now pending are; First, has it been proven that a liquidation of accounts was made between the contracting parties, to the resulting balance of which the debtor agreed?\u00a0 Second, it being stipulated in the contract of May 3, 1901, that all the accounts and indebtedness of the debtor would be liquidated on the 30th of June, 1902, the date when the obligation became due, could the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos liquidate the interest and capitalize it every six months during the time that the loan contract was in force, notwithstanding the agreement contained in the said instrument?\u00a0 Third, outside of the 5,000 pesos loaned, and supposing that the business relations between the debtor and creditor continued subsequent to the 30th of June, 1902, would any balance due by the defendant as a result earn interest at the rate of 9 per cent as agreed between the contracting parties with respect to the said 5,000 pesos?<br\/><br\/>The evidence adduced at the trial, particularly the documentary proofs, does not show in a satisfactory manner that any liquidation of the proceeds of the sugar delivered by the defendant in payment of his debt to the creditor company was made on the 30th of June, 1902, as agreed in the said document of indebtedness, nor does it appear that there existed a balance as the result of a liquidation to which the debtor had agreed.<br\/><br\/>Both parties have admitted that during the term of the contract, up to the 9th of June, 1902, the debtor, as had been agreed upon, had delivered various amounts of sugar on account of his indebtedness, and in order that it clearly appear whether or not his debt of 5,000 pesos was settled on the 30th of June, 1902, it becomes necessary for the creditor to make up an itemized account, in accordance with clause 8 of the contract, which the debtor, who alleges with some show of proof that he has fulfilled the contract, has a perfect right to demand; and for these reasons the first question should be answered in the negative.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, the liquidation will necessarily show whether the defendant still owes in part or in whole the 5,000 pesos secured by the mortgage of the hacienda \"Basag,\" or whether said mortgage debt has already been settled; this detail is of importance in order to determine whether the resulting debt can be the object of an action for foreclosure, or simply of an ordinary action, because although the procedure is analogous in both actions, a wide difference exists between a judgment rendered in an action for foreclosure, and that entered in an ordinary action.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the second question the answer must also be in the negative, inasmuch as if what was agreed between the contracting parties is the law that secures their respective rights and obligations, and if in the said contract they stipulated that all their accounts and the debts of the defendant would be liquidated on the 30th of June, 1902, the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos, the creditor, had no right to compute interest every six months and add it to the capital; it was not authorized so to do by the written contract.<br\/><br\/>It was not agreed upon between the parties that at the expiration of every six months, interest at 9 per cent per annum would be capitalized and added to the 5,000 pesos, so that it might in turn earn 9 per cent interest, together with the said capital; the creditor company had therefore no right to make up the said half yearly liquidation of interest, for the reason that article 1755 Of the Civil Code provides that interest shall only be owed when it has been expressly stipulated, and said legal provision would be violated if compound interest be permitted, that is to say, that without a written agreement, interest may be compounded before the obligation becomes due, in order that the net amount of interest may in turn earn the same rate of interest without the consent of the debtor, inasmuch as interest due shall only earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded, even if the obligation should be silent on this point.\u00a0 (Art. 1109, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The first and highest court in Spain, in applying these provisions of the code, has established in its decisions of January 18, 1873, and December 16, 1887, the rule that the law of March 14, 1856, far from authorizing the charging of interest on interest, provides that during the term of the contract, interest due but not paid can not bear interest; however, net unpaid interest may be capitalized, and new interest may be stipulated on the increased amount of capital, but such an agreement shall be null and void unless in writing.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the third question, it must be borne in mind that by the public instrument above alluded to, the amount loaned is limited to 5,000 pesos, which shall bear interest at the rate of 9 per cent per annum.<br\/><br\/>Given the terms of the contract with relation to these points, and in view of the fact that no interest was stipulated on other sums subsequently loaned to the defendant by reason of, or in consequence of the business carried on between him and the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos from June 30, 1902, to October, 1905, it is not lawful that other amounts which the debtor, Basilio Majinay, might owe outside of the said 5,000 pesos should bear the interest of 9 per cent agreed upon on the last-named sum, since at the time when such other amounts were loaned it does not appear that any interest was agreed upon between the contracting parties, either orally or in writing, as has been already stated.<br\/><br\/>The creditor company is entitled to the interest mentioned in article 1108 of the Civil Code with respect to such amounts as were loaned outside of the said written contract; but not to the 9 per cent interest per annum because such a pretension, as has been shown, is contrary to law, and furthermore, because the literal sense of the clauses of a contract must be observed when its terms are clear and leave no room for doubt of the intent of the contracting parties; whatever may be the generality of its terms, it is not lawful to consider that other things and cases different from what the parties in interest intended to contract for are therein comprised.\u00a0 (Arts. 1281 and 1283, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>For the considerations above set forth, and especially in view of the absence of the liquidation which should have been made on the 30th of June, 1902, there are no provisions in the law by which, according to what has been alleged and proven in this case, a proper decision may be entered in this litigation; hence, in compliance with the provisions of section 496 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and notwithstanding the force and efficiency of the aforesaid public instrument of indebtedness, it is proper that a new trial be held in order that a liquidation may be made in legal form between the parties in this suit, and that another judgment may be entered in accordance with the weight of the evidence and the merits of the case, taking into account the terms of the written contract, the amount that is therein secured by mortgage, and the interest that said amount should bear as being the only one which may be the subject of proceedings for foreclosure.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the judgment appealed from is hereby set aside or reversed, and the judge of the Court of First Instance shall proceed in accordance with the law and the terms of this decision.<br\/><br\/><i>Mapa, Carson, Willard<\/i>, and <i>Tracey, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

The court erred in finding that the general demurrer offered by the defendant Oscar Bogacki should be overruled for having been presented after the proofs had been submitted.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The court erred in finding that the complaint had been cured by the testimony of the plaintiff.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>There was no motion for a new trial in the court below, and while the proof was brought to this court we can not examine it for the reason that this court has many times decided that in the absence of a motion for a new trial in the lower court and an exception taken to the ruling of the court thereon, this court can not examine the evidence.\u00a0 In order, therefore, to determine whether or not the lower court committed the errors assigned above, an examination of the facts stated in the decision of the lower court only can be made.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the first assignment of error, the lower court stated in his decision that the defendant Bogacki Interposed a general demurrer after all of the proof had been presented by both parties in the trial.\u00a0 The lower court further stated that the complaint presented by the plaintiff was very weak and insufficient, and that if the general demurrer had been presented before the commencement of the trial, it might have been sustained, but that in the opinion of the court the defects in the said complaint had been cured by the declarations of the plaintiff, presented during the trial, without opposition on the part of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>We must accept this finding of facts on the part of the court.\u00a0 If it is true, and the fact is not denied, that whatever defects in the matter of allegations which existed in the complaint had been cured by the evidence adduced during the trial, then a demurrer presented after the proof was admitted without opposition could not be effective.<br\/><br\/>The appellant calls our attention to section 93 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, which provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"If no objection be taken to the complaint, either by demurrer or answer, the defendant shall be deemed to have waived all objections, excepting only the objection to the jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter and that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>No rule is better established than the rule which requires the complaint to contain a statement of all of the facts constituting the plaintiff's cause of action.\u00a0 If it does not, it is subject to demurrer.\u00a0 The rule is also well established that if the defendant permits evidence to be introduced, without objection, which supplies the necessary allegations of a defective complaint, then this evidence has the effect of curing the defects of such a complaint and a demurrer thereafter is inadmissible upon the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u00a0 Not only are defective pleadings cured by the admission of evidence without objection, during the trial, but the court is required to render a judgment in any particular case, giving such relief as is consistent with the case made by the pleadings and the evidence.\u00a0 (See sec. 126, Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, and sec. 2533 of the Compilation of the Acts of the Philippine Commission.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court being fully supported by the law, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano C.

Juana Jimenez, the amount of P6,600 in payment of the debt and interest according to the final judgment entered on the 31st day of March by said Court of First Instance, subject to the disposition of the plaintiff, and P70 in payment of the costs.\u00a0 It appeared that this amount of money had been tendered to the plaintiff for the repurchase of the property, which offer the plaintiff Beech had refused.<br\/><br\/>On the 16th day of December, 1908, and after the decision of this court had been announced in case No. 4690, the judge of the court below made an order, at the request of Juana Jimenez, directing the payment by the clerk of the court to Bibiano Ba\u00f1ez of P1,500, part of the money thus deposited, and to Juana Luis y Hernandez of P5,170, the balance of such sum.\u00a0 These payments were made by the clerk of the court pursuant to such order to the parties therein mentioned. No final judgment was entered in this court in case No. 4690 until the 22d day of December, 1908.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff commenced this action of certiorari on the 17th of December, 1908, alleging that the defendant judge, in making the order for the payments aforesaid, exceeded his jurisdiction.\u00a0 This claim is based upon the fact that on the 16th day of November, 1908, this court, in case No. 4690, had issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the court below from taking any further proceedings in said action No. 5816 until the further order of the court.<br\/><br\/>There are several questions presented by the plaintiff in this action.\u00a0 One is, whether an act otherwise within the jurisdiction of the court below falls outside of his jurisdiction when he has been restrained by injunction from performing it?\u00a0 Another is, whether Bibiano Ba\u00f1ez and Juana Luis y Hernandez were entitled to appear and take part in the proceedings in case No. 5816?\u00a0 A third is, whether the plaintiff was entitled to notice of the application made by those persons for the payment to them of the money deposited into court by Juana Jimenez?\u00a0 Another is, whether the money so deposited belonged to Juana Jimenez or belonged to these two persons from whom she alleged she had borrowed it?<br\/><br\/>Before undertaking to decide these or other questions presented by the case, it is necessary to consider what interest the plaintiff has in their resolution.<br\/><br\/>The question litigated in the court below in case No. 5816 was whether or not the defendant Juana Jimenez had the right to repurchase the property in question.\u00a0 The plaintiff Beech claimed that she had no such right, the time for the repurchase thereof having expired.\u00a0 The court held that she did have such right and that she might exercise it by paying the amount due for the repurchase before the 15th day of May, 1908.\u00a0 For the purpose of securing that right, she made the offer of repurchase, and this offer not being accepted by the plaintiff, she deposited the money in court.\u00a0 This money in no sense belonged to the plaintiff.\u00a0 He had a right to accept it, but on condition that he reconvey the property.\u00a0 If he did not see fit to accept it, he had no right thereto.\u00a0 It appears clearly from the terms of the notice given to the plaintiff by the defendant Juana Jimenez at the time she made the deposit that she deposited it for the purpose of making the repurchase and not for the payment of rent which might be due for the use of the property.\u00a0 We, therefore, hold that the plaintiff had no claim or lien of any kind upon the money in question.<br\/><br\/>It was said, however, in the argument by the plaintiff that, if the money had remained there until final judgment had been entered in case No. 5816 in favor of the plaintiff Beech, he could have levied his execution, which would have been in part for tbe payment of money, upon this fund at the moment when it was turned over by the clerk to Juana Jimenez.\u00a0 This contention can not be sustained because it appears from the record that on the 14th day of December, 1908, and prior to the making of the order of payment of the 16th day of December, and prior to the time when the plaintiff had or could have secured any judgment against Juana Jimenez, she had assigned and transferred to Bibiano Ba\u00f1ez and Juana Luis y Hernandez all her interest in this fund.\u00a0 The reason for that assignment was the fact that she had borrowed the money from them.\u00a0 It thus appears that the plaintiff, on the 16th of December, when the order complained of was made, had no interest in this money and could acquire none.\u00a0 Whether it remained in court or was paid to Juana Jimenez or to other persons was a matter of indifference to him.\u00a0 That order did not, and could not in any way affect his rights and he was in no way prejudiced thereby.\u00a0 The decision of the questions presented by him upon the hearing in this case in this court, whether decided one way or the other, will be of no interest to him, except as they may settle some mooted points.\u00a0 That a court will not sit for the purpose of trying moot cases and spend its time in deciding questions the resolution of which can not in any way affect the rights of the person or persons presenting them is well settled.<br\/><br\/>It was suggested at the argument that some of the defendants in this case had made no proper answer to the order to show cause.\u00a0 We had directed that the defendants should appear and state their reasons why a writ of certiorari should not be granted.\u00a0 Some of them appeared and presented what they called a demurrer to the complaint and the plaintiff says that a demurrer in such cases is improper.\u00a0 That is true, but the document they presented was improperly called by them a demurrer.\u00a0 If they saw fit to answer the order to show cause by saying that they admitted all the facts stated in the complaint, but that even on such admission the plaintiff was not entitled to relief, they had a right to do so.\u00a0 That is, in effect, what they did.\u00a0 The document which they called a demurrer was, in effect, their answer to the order to show cause.\u00a0 If we had held that that answer was insufficient, we should have ordered a writ of certiorari to issue and should not have allowed them to withdraw their so-called demurrer and present another answer.<br\/><br\/>In the complaint in this case the plaintiff asks that the defendant judge and clerk be punished for contempt for violating the injunction above referred to.\u00a0 A proceeding for the punishment of a person for contempt can not be joined with an action in certiorari.<br\/><br\/>We hold that the answers given by the defendants are sufficient and this case is dismissed, with costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

DELL, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, <i>VS.<\/i> MANILA ELECTRIC RAILROAD AND LIGHT COMPANY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 1st day of April, 1907, the plaintiff commenced an action in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila to recover the sum of P500 as damages for injuries done by the defendant to a hearse belonging to the plaintiff, which damages, it was alleged, were caused through the neglect of the employees of the defendant in operating a car upon the street railway owned by the defendant.\u00a0 The defendant filed a general denial.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the lower court who saw and heard the witnesses made the following findings of fact;<br\/><blockquote>\"From the evidence presented\u00a0 at the trial it appears that a car, belonging to the defendant and operated by employees of the defendant, running along Calle Cabildo, and reaching a street running at right angles to it, Calle Victoria, there ran into a hearse belonging to the plaintiff which was being hauled by one horse.\"<br\/><br\/>\"The driver of the hearse was thrown to the ground and injured, and could only testify as to the fact of being injured, and could not give any more information for the reason that he became unconscious on being thrown from the hearse which he was driving.<br\/><br\/>\"A witness, who was not present in court, but whose declaration was received as though made in court, testified that the car was running at great speed, and that it was not giving any notice by ringing of the bell of its coming.\u00a0 It appears that the defendant's car struck the hearse in the rear part of it and shoved it along so that finally the wheels were smashed and the hearse was overturned at the corner of the street further on from where the collision took\u00a0 place, and the car went clear across Calle Victoria and before it was stopped it was practically its full length beyond.<br\/><br\/>\"There was evidence on the part of the defendant that the car was running at the usual speed, and that the gong on the car was repeatedly sounded; and one witness testified that the car was only going as fast as one would walk.<br\/><br\/>\"I am of the opinion that if the car had only been going as fast as one would walk, it could have been stopped without collision with the hearse, and failure to do so constituted a negligent act on the part of the defendant.\u00a0 The fact that the car went, after the collision took place, across the street and ran nearly the length beyond the street, would indicate that it must have been going at a greater rate of speed and probably a higher rate of speed than would be justified at such places as that where the accident occurred, and that the running at such a rate would constitute negligence on the part of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>\"The fact that the hearse had nearly crossed the track, so that the car only came in collision with the hind part of it, would indicate that plaintiff's driver had not heard the striking of the gong, and that he had the right of way.<br\/><br\/>\"The evidence in relation to the value of the injury to the hearse\u00a0 was very poor.\u00a0 The plaintiff testified that the hearse was completely destroyed, so that it would be as expensive to repair it as it would to make a new one, and that it was worth probably the sum of P500.<br\/><br\/>\"In the light of the circumstances which appeared in the case, that the hearse was driven along by the car, the wheels smashed and then the hearse overturned, must indicate that the hearse was not wholly destroyed, or that if it was so destroyed is to render it entirely worthless that it was of small value in the first place, and I find from a fair deduction, from the evidence as presented, that the value of the damage to the hearse was the sum of P300.<br\/><br\/>\"The conclusions are, that the defendant, having operated its car upon the street in a negligent manner, so that the plaintiff's hearse was collided with and partially destroyed, is liable for the damages arising therefrom.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Upon these facts the lower court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the sum of P300 and the costs of the action.\u00a0 From this decision of the lower court the defendant appealed, and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"I.\u00a0 The court erred in finding that the damage to plaintiff's property was caused by defendant's negligence.<br\/><br\/>\"II.\u00a0 The court erred in failing to find that the negligence of plaintiff's employee caused, or contributed to, the damage.<br\/><br\/>\"III.\u00a0 The court erred in rendering judgment for plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>\"IV.\u00a0 The court erred in denying defendant's motion for a new trial.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>With reference to the first above-noted assignment of error the lower\u00a0 court found that the defendant was guilty of negligence.\u00a0 Upon this question the lower court said :<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"I am of the opinion that if the car had only been going as fast as one would walk, it could have been stopped without collision with the hearse, and failure to do so constituted a negligent act on the part of the defendant.\u00a0 The fact that the car went, after the collision took place, across the street and ran nearly the length beyond the street, would indicate that it must have been going at a greater rate of speed and\u00a0 probably a higher rate of speed than\u00a0 would be justified at such places as that where the accident occurred, and that the running at such a rate would constitute negligence on the part of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>\"The fact that the hearse had nearly crossed the track, so that the car only came in collision with the hind part of it, would indicate that plaintiff's driver had not heard the striking of the gong, and that he had the right of way.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Was this finding of fact in accordance with\u00a0 the preponderance of evidence adduced during the trial of said cause?\u00a0 If it is, then the finding of fact by the lower court must be sustained.\u00a0 (Rakes <i>vs.<\/i> Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Co., 7 Phil. Rep., 359; sec. 1, Act No. 1596.)<br\/><br\/>The proof relating to the negligence of the parties is as follows:\u00a0 Alfred B. Jones testified-<br\/><blockquote>\"That oh the 2d day of March, 1907, the said witness was accompanying a hearse owned by Mr. R. V. Dell, and was going along Calle Victoria toward Calle Cabildo, in the city of Manila; that as the said hearse reached the corner of Calles Victoria and Cabildo, a car owned by the Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company was going through said Calle Cabildo at a high rate of speed in the direction of the Luneta; that as the car was nearing the said corner no signal was given nor was the gong sounded to warn the\u00a0 public; that on the said date and under the said circumstances the car above referred to collided with the said hearse owned by R. V. Dell, breaking and destroying the same through\u00a0 no carelessness on the part of the persons in charge thereof, and that the said collision and damage were caused solely through the negligence of the Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company and its agents who conducted the said car on the aforesaid occasion.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Lorenzo Hieronimo, a witness for the plaintiff, testified:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q.\u00a0 On or about the 2d day of March of this year what work were you engaged in for Mr. Dell?-A.\u00a0 I was employed by him as a <i>cochero.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Were you driving a carriage of his on that day?-A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 What happened to that carriage on that day?-A.\u00a0 We were coming from Bagumbayan in the direction of the Bureau of Health to obtain a license, and we were approaching Calle Cabildo; we did not hear anything to show that a street car was coming, and so I did not slacken the speed of my\u00a0 horse, and when I was crossing the track at Calle Cabildo coming along Calle Victoria the carriage was struck by a street car.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 How far were you on the track when you noticed the car coming?-A.\u00a0 The horse was already on the track where the street cars pass by.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Did you hold up the horse or try to go ahead?-A.\u00a0 I continued driving ahead, so that the street car would not catch us.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 At what speed were you going?-A.\u00a0 Not very fast, and not very slow, the horse was on a trot.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Is this a very fast horse?-A.\u00a0 No, sir; not very fast.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Did you have him under control at that time?-A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Did this man here [indicating Van Hoven] come to the hospital to talk with you?-A.\u00a0 I believe so, I believe he spoke to me at the hospital.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Did you tell Mr. Van Hoven at the hospital that you tried to stop the horse\u00a0 before you collided with the street car, but that you could not because he was hard bitted?-A.\u00a0 I did not say such a thing.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Did you say that to anybody at the hospital?-A. No, sir; to nobody.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Antonio Legarda, a witness for the defense, testified:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Were you a passenger on the street car last March when it struck an undertaker's wagon?-A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Where did the accident happen on Calle Cabildo?-A.\u00a0 At the crossing\u00a0 of Calle Victoria with Calle Cabildo, in front of the Young Men's Christian Association building.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Will you please state to the court what you saw in regard to the accident?-A.\u00a0 When the car came near to Calle Victoria I observed that the motorman rang the bell rapidly.\u00a0 Then I put my head out of the window on the right-hand side of the car as going on, and I saw a horse pulling a wagon, and observed that the driver held the reins very tight, then I withdrew my head from the window and saw the wagon just in front of the street car at approximately the distance of one meter or a meter and half from the driver of the wagon to the street car.\u00a0 Then I said to myself that a collision will be inevitable.\u00a0 At the time the motorman was\u00a0 ringing the bell continually, and he put on the brakes, and when the street car struck the wagon one of those who were sitting on the box of the wagon jumped on the sidewalk and the cochero was dragged by the horses because he did not let go of the reins, but was holding on to them tightly, and a few seconds afterwards I saw that his head was bleeding.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Where did the street car stop?-A.\u00a0 Two or three meters beyond Calle Victoria.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 In front of the Young Men's Christian Association building?-A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Was the car clear of Calle Victoria when it came to a stop?-A.\u00a0 I believe so, but I am not sure.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 And the first thing you saw when you looked out of the window was the <i>cochero<\/i>?-A.\u00a0 No, sir; I saw about two-thirds of the horses.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 How many horses were there?-A, Either one or two, I do not remember.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 When the street car struck the wagon what happened to the wagon?-A.\u00a0 It was dragged along, and the two wheels were torn off.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 What happened to the carriage after that, was it tipped over, or did it stand up?-A.\u00a0 It was thrown on the side.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 And when the wagon tipped on its side what part of the street was it on?-A.\u00a0 As we were going, on the right-hand side of the street.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Tell the court if you can just where the car stopped.-A.\u00a0 Just about the first window of the Young Men's Christian Association building.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 The front end or the rear end?-A.\u00a0 If I remember it was the middle.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Then the car was just about clear of the corner of the Young Men's Christian Association building?-A.

I saw the wagon coming from Calle Victoria, and just as the car was passing by it struck the wagon.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Was the street car going very slow?-A.\u00a0 Very slow.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>An examination of this proof shows some conflict with reference to some important facts.\u00a0 Some of the witnesses testified that the hearse driven by the plaintiff was going slowly at the time the accident occurred, while others testified that the hearse was going rapidly.\u00a0 Some of the witnesses testified that the motorman was sounding the gong all the time while the car was passing Cabildo Street.\u00a0 The motorman himself, however, who probably was giving more attention to that particular matter than the passengers or any of the other witnesses present, stated that he sounded the gong when he came near to Victoria Street and does not pretend that he was sounding the gong all the time.\u00a0 His testimony is open to the clear inference that he did not sound the gong until after he saw the hearse and horse in the street in front of him.\u00a0 All the witnesses agree that the hearse was crossing the street from left to right.\u00a0 Some of the witnesses (passengers on the car) testified that they looked out of the right-hand side of the car and saw the horse and a part of the hearse before the car came in contact with the hearse.\u00a0\u00a0 Had the car been moving slowly, as contended by the defense, and had the motorman had the control of his car which he should have had, he certainly might have stopped his car, without causing the injuries complained of.\u00a0 The lower court found that the fact that the car went across the street after the collision took place, and nearly the full length of the car beyond the street, indicated that the car, was moving at a higher speed than could be justified at such places, and that moving at such a rate of speed constituted negligence on the part of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The witness Chaves testified in effect that the motorman put on the brakes at the time the car struck the hearse.\u00a0 This fact is also corroborated by the motorman.\u00a0 He said, in answer to the question, \"How fast were you running at the time of the accident?:\" \"I was just getting the current.\"\u00a0 \"Getting the current\" is a different effort from stopping the car.\u00a0 The\u00a0 motorman further said in answer to the question, \"Did you shut off\u00a0 the power any time, etc.?\"\u00a0 \"I did on coming to cross the corner.\"\u00a0\u00a0 We have then the proof that some of the passengers saw the horse and a part of the hearse out of the window on the right-hand side of the car before the collision took place; that the motorman put on his brake at the time of the collision, and also that at the time of the collision the motorman was just \"getting his current.\"<br\/><br\/>This all goes to show that the motorman had not taken the precautions necessary to avoid the accident which actually occurred, or, in other words, he did not have that control of his car required under the conditions, considering the exceedingly narrow streets through which he was running and which he was crossing.\u00a0 The driver of the hearse, so far as the record shows, had no notice that the street car was approaching, and entering and crossing, as he did and having nearly crossed the street, he had the right of way.\u00a0 The car had no paramount right of way over the vehicle at the intersection or crossing of the streets.\u00a0 The rights of each were equal.<br\/><br\/>Upon the question of the duty of a street railway company operating in the streets of a city, there have been literally hundreds of decisions in the United States as well as in the different states of Europe.\u00a0 In the United States, especially, for the reason that the facts are found by a jury, and the question of negligence or the lack of care or the exercise of care has so largely depended upon the peculiar circumstances, perhaps existing\u00a0 at the time of the trial only, it is futile to attempt to harmonize the rules as to what particular set\u00a0 of facts will or will not constitute negligence.\u00a0 There are, however, some general rules relating to the duty and obligations of those who use the public thoroughfares, whether they be pedestrians, carriages, or street car companies that are well recognized.\u00a0 They may be stated as follows:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 The entire public has a right to the use of the public highways an streets of the city.\u00a0 A street car company has no paramount right of way over pedestrians or vehicles at street crossings.\u00a0 The rights of each are equal.\u00a0 (Joyce on Electric Railways, section 589.)<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 This right in the street is equal and each may use it to his\u00a0 best advantage, having a just regard for the equal rights of\u00a0 others.\u00a0 (O'Neil <i>vs.<\/i> Railroad Company, 129 N. Y., 125.)<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 The right to use the street for lawful purposes is not different or enlarged or diminished simply because one uses it in one way as a pedestrian or another uses it in another way with his\u00a0 horses and carriages and still another uses it by other means of locomotion.\u00a0 However, it may be that certain portions of the street may be designated or especially prepared for pedestrians and another portion for carriages, in which case if a pedestrian should use that portion assigned for horses and carriages or <i>vice versa<\/i>, a different degree of care might be required.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 The mere fact that a car company has been permitted to operate its cars in the streets has in noway, in the absence of express provisions of law, abridged or lessened the rights of others who desire to make use of the streets.\u00a0 Owing to the fact, however, that a street car runs upon rails fixed in place, it must follow the track.\u00a0 Other persons using that portion of the street must recognize this fact, and, therefore, the \"rules of the road\" with reference to turning out, etc., do not apply to such companies.<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 The laying down of rails in the streets of a city and the running\u00a0 of street\u00a0 cars over them for the accommodation of persons desiring to travel in that way on the streets is only a later mode of using the land as a way-using it for the very purpose for which it was originally taken.\u00a0 This use of the street may be a change in the mode, but it is not a change in the use and purpose for which streets are dedicated.\u00a0 The land is still used for a highway.\u00a0 This rule of law applies equally whether the motor for propelling the car is a horse or electricity.<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 The people of a city and vehicles of whatever kinds, in the absence of express legislation, have the same right to pass along an intersecting street as a street car to go across it.\u00a0 The car has a right to cross and must cross the street, and pedestrians and vehicles have a right to cross and must cross the railroad track; neither has a superior right over the other; their rights are equal.<br\/><br\/>Seventh.\u00a0 The drivers and conductors of street railway cars, whatever the mode of power, have, in general, the same rights, and duties, and no greater and no less than those who manage other vehicles crossing their course.<br\/><br\/><i>Suppose, for example, that a street railway company should operate\u00a0 two lines of cars on cross streets in the same city, would the company allow its employees to cross an intersecting street with its cars without having the car under such complete control that it might be stopped at any moment in order to avoid collision?\u00a0 This question the railroad company, of course, would answer in the negative.\u00a0 This rule would be adopted and enforced simply out of the abundance of caution to protect its own property and the lives of its patrons, but the crossing lines have no greater right simply because they are owned and operated by the same company.\u00a0 The same rules must be enforced when such crossing lines are controlled by different companies, or otherwise there would be endless confusion and injury.\u00a0 The street car company having no greater rights in the streets than other carriages, etc., then the same degree of care must be exercised as to carriages as would be exercised as to other cars crossing streets.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Eighth.\u00a0 One about to drive across a street car track at a public street crossing is not required to look along the whole length of the visible track to see if a car is coming, but only far enough to warrant an ordinarily careful and prudent man, having in mind his own safety, under like circumstances, to conclude that ho car is in such proximity, as, if properly managed, to endanger his safety in crossing.<br\/><br\/>Ninth.\u00a0 Negligence in approaching the crossing of a street car track, without having his horses under control, will not preclude a recovery for injuries which he receives by a collision with a street car in attempting to cross in front of the car, if at the time he discovered the car the circumstances were such as to justify a prudent man in attempting to make the crossing.\u00a0 (Garritty, etc., <i>vs.<\/i> Detroit Street Railway Company, 37 Lawyers' Reports Annotated, 529.)<br\/><br\/>Tenth.\u00a0 The right which a street car (whatever be its motive power) has in a highway or street is not in its nature higher than the right of other travelers, but is a common right with the others, the exercise of which the street car and the other travelers shall use and conduct so as not to interfere unreasonably with the just rights of each.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the second above assignment of error, the defendant\u00a0 and appellant cites many cases in support of his argument that the plaintiff by his own negligence contributed to his injuries and, therefore, can not recover.\u00a0 This court in a divided opinion (Rakes <i>vs.<\/i> Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Co.) has repudiated the doctrine of contributory negligence as adopted in the United States and England and has adopted in its stead a doctrine which might be designated a proportional contributory negligence doctrine.\u00a0 This doctrine must stand until it is overruled, whether we agree with it or not.\u00a0 Mr. Justice Tracey wrote that opinion.\u00a0 The doctrine\u00a0 established in the majority opinion seems to have been taken from the jurisprudence of France, Spain, and Canada.\u00a0 (Rakes <i>vs.<\/i> Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Co., 7 Phil. Rep., 359, 371, 372.)\u00a0 In that case this court adopted the doctrine that the contributory negligence of the person injured had the effect only of reducing the amount of damages which he might recover, and cited decisions of the supreme court of France in its\u00a0 support.\u00a0 The court further held that contributory negligence did not exonerate the defendants whose fault had been the immediate cause of the accident, but entitled them to a reduction of damage's only.<br\/><br\/>Upon the question of the amount of damages, the only proof is that found in the testimony of the plaintiff himself.\u00a0 He testified that the damages were \"in the neighborhood of P500.\"\u00a0 From the record it appears that the defendant, through its claim agent, indicated to the plaintiff that P200 would be paid to settle the claim made by the plaintiff.\u00a0 The lower court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for P300 and costs.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion, and so hold, that in view of all the facts, the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres<\/i> and <i>Mapa, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><i>Carson<\/i> and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., dissent.<br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><center style=\"font-weight: bold;\">DISSENTING<\/center><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">TRACEY,\u00a0 J.,<\/span><br\/><br\/>The driver of the plaintiff's wagon was guilty of negligence which contributed as a cause to the accident itself, and for that reason the plaintiff should not recover.\u00a0 The rule of contributory negligence in this jurisdiction was laid down in the Rakes case\u00a0 (7 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 359) to be that, where the negligence of the party injured has contributed only to his own injury, he may recover his proportional damages, but when it has contributed as a cause to the accident itself, he can not recover, the court saying at<br\/>page 374:<br\/><blockquote>\"Difficulty seems to be apprehended in deciding which acts of the\u00a0 injured party shall be considered immediate causes of the accident.\u00a0 The test is simple.\u00a0 Distinction must be made between the accident and the injury, between the event itself, without which there could have been no accident, and those acts of the victim\u00a0 not entering into it, independent of it, but contributing to his own proper hurt.\u00a0 For instance, the cause of the accident under review was the displacement of the crosspiece or the failure\u00a0 to replace it.\u00a0 This\u00a0 produced the event giving occasion for damages; that is, the sinking of the track and sliding of the iron rails.\u00a0 To this event, the act of the plaintiff in walking by the side of the car did not contribute, although it was an element of the damage which came to himself.\u00a0 Had the crosspiece been out of place wholly or partly through his\u00a0 act or omission of duty, that would have been one of the determining causes of the event or accident for which he would have been responsible.\u00a0 Where he contributes to the principal occurrence as one of its determining factors, he can not recover.\u00a0 Where, in conjunction with the occurrence, he contributes only to his own injury, he may recover the amount that the defendant responsible for the event should pay for such injury, less a sum deemed a suitable equivalent for his own imprudence.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Under the prevailing American rule, the plaintiff can not recover if chargeable with contributory negligence of any kind.<br\/><br\/>In this case, the plaintiff's\u00a0 servant, the driver of his wagon, testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"And we were approaching Calle Cabildo, we did not hear anything to show that a street car was coming, and so <i>I did not slacken the speed of my horse<\/i>, and when I was crossing the track at Calle Cabildo, coming along Calle Victoria, the carriage was struck by a street car.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 How far were you on the track when you noticed the car coming?-A.\u00a0 The horse was already on the track where the street cars pass by.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Did you hold up the horse or try to go ahead?-A.\u00a0 I continued driving ahead, so that the street car would not catch us.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 How far away was the car when you first saw it?-A.\u00a0 I did not pay any attention to the distance of the car, I only paid attention to my own rig, to avoid its being struck by the street car.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Where did this accident happen?-A.\u00a0 On Calle Cabildo.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 And what other street?-A.\u00a0 Crossing Calle Cabildo, going along Calle Victoria.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.

Y., 125), Judge Earl well states the law of city street crossings.\u00a0 Referring to vehicles traveling along the railway tracks, he observes (p. 130) :<br\/><blockquote>\"As to such vehicles, the railways have the paramount right to be exercised in a reasonable and prudent manner.\u00a0 But a railway crossing\u00a0 a street stands upon a different footing.\u00a0 The car has the right to cross and must cross the street, and the vehicle has the right to cross and must cross the railroad track.\u00a0 Neither has a superior right to the other.\u00a0 The right of each must be exercised with due regard to the right of the other, and the right of each must be exercised in a reasonable and careful manner, so as not unreasonably to abridge or interfere with the right of the other.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It was the duty of the driver of the wagon on reaching the crossing to look for an approaching street car.\u00a0 Had he done so, he could not have failed to observe it.\u00a0 That he did not do so, is\u00a0 apparent from his frank testimony; that he had ample time to do so, is indicated from the fact that the car struck the rear part of the wagon.\u00a0 He either did\u00a0 not look for the car, or he saw it and\u00a0 took his chance of clearing the crossing.\u00a0 A grosser case of contributory negligence can hardly be found in the books.\u00a0 It contributed to the accident itself, and, applying the rule of the Rakes case, the plaintiff should not recover.<br\/><\/div>",

this decision therefore deals with him only.<br\/><br\/>From the above facts it appears as proven that the violent death of Fernando Medel was caused by four individuals who sequestered him and his wife, Francisca Gozon, from their house and led them, the former with his elbows tied together, into a sugar-cane field at a place called Calauit, where the body with several wounds was found on Sunday, the following day.\u00a0 The crime should be classified as murder, because the victim was seriously wounded and deprived of his life at a time when he was unarmed and unable to defend himself or even escape from his armed aggressors who, when conducting him to said cane field, used means and methods in committing the crime that insured its consummation without any risk to themselves from such defense as the victim might have offered, and, even though there were no witnesses present when the crime was committed, it can not be believed, nor is there any evidence to show that his captors, prior to attacking him, had set him at liberty, for when the latter decided to kill him they tied him by the elbows in order to facilitate the execution of the crime.\u00a0 Unquestionably it falls within the provisions of article 403 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>The accused appellant, Pedro Supila, pleaded not guilty, but, notwithstanding his exculpatory allegations which, in the opinion of this court, have not been satisfactorily established, the case offers conclusive evidence that the said Pedro Supila was one of the four individuals who, on the afternoon of Saturday, the 11th of May, 1907, sequestered the deceased and his wife and conducted them to the said sitio of Calauit where the husband was murdered, inasmuch as three witnesses to the sequestration pointed out and recognized the said Pedro Supila as one of the four armed persons who effected the said sequestration, and who further testified that when they heard the cries of the wife of the deceased and went to the house to render assistance, Pablo Flores and Basilio Escala, old men over sixty years of age and tenants of the deceased, were unable to enter, because the thieves threatened them with their weapons, telling them that neither the tenants nor the employees of Medel had anything to do with the matter, and that it was not their property.\u00a0 Escala then ran out calling for help, but no one answered as they were the only persons in the vicinity.\u00a0 When the criminals left, taking with them the married couple, the tenant Flores begged them to at least set the woman free, but one of them said to him that, if Flores insisted upon defending her, he would strike the woman with his bolo, whereupon Flores\u00a0 ceased speaking.\u00a0 The third witness, Simplicio, testified that Pedro was one of those who objected to the said Escala and Flores entering the house in response to the cries of the woman, the said witnesses further testifying that they saw one of the aggressors take away the revolver and bolo of the deceased.<br\/><br\/>It appears therefore froin the record of the proceedings that it is fully and unquestionably proven that Pedro Supila directly participated in the commission of the crime, inasmuch as he was one of the four individuals who sequestered the deceased, bound and conducted him to the place where his body was found on the following day.\u00a0 There is no specific and detailed evidence in the case as to which of the four sequestrators actually inflicted the wounds found on the body of Fernando Medel; but it is a well-known legal theory that all those who took part and witnessed the execution of the crime and did not oppose its consummation are equally responsible therefor, and deserving of the penalty that the law imposes.<br\/><br\/>If the allegation that Pedro Supila should be considered as an accomplice through lack of evidence to show that he was one of those who wounded the deceased, were just and in accordance with the law, his three companions, should they be captured, could advance the same plea, as long as only the same kind of evidence was forthcoming, and thus we would\u00a0 have a case where, after committing a crime, the only parties directly responsible for its perpetration become nothing more\u00a0 than mere accessories thereto.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the observations of the trial judge as set forth in his decision, Pedro Supila, as pointed out in the brief of the Attorney-General, is considered as coauthor of the murder in question.<br\/><br\/>The mere fact that the complaint filed by the provincial fiscal only accuses him of complicity in the said murder to the extent of being an accomplice therein, is not, in view of the result of the evidence, a bar to his conviction as coauthor of the crime.\u00a0 The crime must be established in the decision of the trial judge in accordance with the evidence in the case, and not according to the opinion of the provincial fiscal without further proofs or particulars than the information obtained during the preliminary investigation.\u00a0 It has already been stated above that the culpability of Pedro Supila as coauthor of said crime has been completely proven; and it should be borne in mind that this is not a case in which the culprit was charged with a crime of relative gravity and is subsequently to be\u00a0 convicted of another calling for a heavier penalty.<br\/><br\/>The complaint wherein Pedro Supila was accused of being an accomplice in the crime of murder sets forth in detail the facts and circumstances that resulted in the murder, as well as the disappearance of the wife of the deceased, which is another crime committed by the four sequestrators, it subsequently appearing from the evidence that the degree of participation, which according to the provincial fiscal was only that of an accomplice, is that of coauthor, and it is neither just nor legal that there be imposed a penalty inadequate to the degree of his guilt.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime there are no aggravating nor mitigating circumstances to be considered, for which reason the penalty, must be imposed in its medium degree.<br\/><br\/>In view of\u00a0 the foregoing, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and that Pedro Supila, as coauthor of the crime of murder, should be sentenced, as we do hereby sentence him to the penalty of <i>cadena perpetua<\/i>, to suffer the accessory penalties 2 and 8 of article 54 of the code together with those stated in the last paragraph thereof in the event of a pardon being granted, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of Pl,000, and to pay the costs of both instances.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

FAUSTINO RAMOS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 24th of August, 1906, counsel for the plaintiff, Juan Sison, presented a written complaint against Faustirio Ramos, alleging that plaintiff owned in the sitio of Tabao, barrio of Magallanes, town of Sagay, Occidental Negros, a tract of land, 94 hectares, 39 ares, and 25 centares in extent, the boundaries of which are described\u00a0 in the complaint; the said land formerly, belonged to Pedro Catalbas, as shown by a title issued by the Government and recorded in the registry of property although later by a judicial decision it became the property of Mariano Devesa, from whom it was ultimately bought by the plaintiff; that the defendant Faustino Ramos, a resident of Sagay and brother-in-law of Pedro Catalbas, occupied, and by mere tolerance was allowed to live on a parcel of the said tract of land of about 5 hectares, more or less, which forms an integral portion of the property described in the\u00a0 complaint, wherein are described the boundaries of the 5 hectares usurped; that in May, 1905, on the defendant being requested by the plaintiff to vacate the parcel occupied by him, he refused to do so, alleging right of ownership over the same, and ever since he has continued to unlawfully occupy it and to receive the benefits and fruits therefrom, inasmuch as the said parcel is planted with cocoanut palms and bamboo, which at the present time yield P200 profits in cocoanuts, P90 in <i>tuba<\/i>, and P60 in bamboo-that is to say, a total of P350-and through the illegal retention of the said parcel, the plaintiff has been subjected to loss and damages to the extent of P500; therefore, he prayed that judgment be entered against the defendant, ordering the restoration of the said parcel of land to the plaintiff, and sentencing him to pay the sum of P850 for loss and damages, and also the costs of the proceedings.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for Faustino Ramos, the defendant, answered the complaint on October 1, 1908, and denied each and every one of the allegations thereof, and in defense alleged that the parcel in question did not measure 5 hectares, but that it had approximately an area of 3 <i>cavanes<\/i>, and that the said land as well as the\u00a0 cocoanut palms, bamboo, and other useful trees planted thereon are of the exclusive and absolute ownership of the defendant who has been in the possession thereof since\u00a0 the year 1884, the date of the purchase thereof from the original owners, and that up to the present day he has been in the quiet, peaceful, and uninterrupted possession thereof; the defendant therefore prayed that he be absolved of the complaint and that costs be adjudged in his favor, without prejudice to any further remedy that might be just and equitable.<br\/><br\/>By a writing dated February 25, 1907, the plaintiff Sison prayed the court below to issue an injunction to restrain the defendant from cutting down any useful plants or trees on the land in question, and that the latter be finally sentenced as prayed for in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>At the trial, evidence was adduced by both parties to the suit, and the documents exhibited by them were\u00a0 made of record; on February 29,1908, the trial judge rendered judgment, holding that the parcel of land claimed in paragraph 3 of the complaint was the property of the defendant, Faustino Ramos.\u00a0 The writ of prohibition issued against him was thereupon annulled\u00a0 and he was absolved of the complaint with the costs in his favor.<br\/><br\/>On being notified of the above decision, the plaintiff, by a petition dated March 3, 1908, moved for a new trial on the ground that the judgment was not in consonance with the facts and the principles of law indicated, and that, therefore, said decision was unlawful; his motion was overruled to which the\u00a0 plaintiff excepted three days later, and in due course presented the corresponding bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>In order that an action for recovery, which is that which the plaintiff, Juan Sison, has brought, may prosper, it is indispensable, according to the constant jurisprudence of the courts, that whoever brings it must fully prove, not only his dominion over the thing claimed, but also the identity of the same.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff endeavors to procure from the defendant, Faustino Ramos, the delivery or restoration of a parcel of land 5 hectares in extent, or, according to the latter, of 3 <i>cavanes<\/i>, which, the plaintiff says, forms an integral portion of his Hacienda Antipolo, which consists of more than 94 hectares of land.\u00a0 He has not, however, satisfactorily substantiated his claim, as it appears from the evidence submitted that the parcel of land described in the complaint is owned by the defendant Ramos, who has possessed it as owner since 1884, in which year he acquired one portion of the land from Constantina Gereos and the other portion from Raymudo Lobaton, as appears from the documents A and B, the authenticity of which has been proven by the testimony of proper witnesses, who also testified to the possession of the defendant as owner of the property in question.<br\/><br\/>Hence, it is an unquestionable fact, admitted by the plaintiff and his witnesses, that the defendant possessed the above-mentioned parcel of land, although it was alleged that the latter, as brother-in-law of the original owner, Pedro Catalbas, was occuping it by mere sufferance of the latter; he was requested by the administrator of said hacienda, Pedro Arellano, to vacate the parcel of land, but Ramos, refused to do so, alleging that it belonged to him.<br\/><br\/>Against the assertion, which has not, however, been proven, that the possession of the parcel of land in question on the part of the defendant was a precarious one, the case furnishes conclusive evidence that the said defendant Ramos had acquired the said parcel of land in two portions by means of proper conveyances from the original owners thereof since 1884, and that ever since that time he has exercised over the property real acts of ownership, and that as such owner he has been in peaceful and public possession, without any interruption whatever, for more than twenty-one years.\u00a0 (Art. 348, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The fact that the said parcel of land was included in the title which Pedro Catalbas obtained by <i>composicion<\/i> from the Government for the large tract of land which afterwards formed the Hacienda Antipolo, does not prejudice or interfere with the rights of the defendant Ramos, because, apart from the fact that such inclusion is rationally explained by the relationship existing between Catalbas and Ramos, who are brothers-in-law, and of the natural desire of the latter to avoid heavy expense in securing title deeds for such a small parcel of land, the son of the former, Quintin Catalbas, as attorney-in-fact for his father, and in his\u00a0 own name, acknowledged to Ramos, as he had promised to do, that the parcel in question, which was included in the title of his father, Pedro Catalbas, was the exclusive property of his uncle, Faustino Ramos, as proven by the document marked Exhibit C, drawn up by the said attorney-in-fact, and which is literally as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The undersigned, as attorney-in-fact of Sr. Pedro Catalbas, declares that Sr. Faustino Ramos, residing in the town of Sagay, owns one parcel of land included in the royal title of the said Sr. Catalbas, measuring three hectares more or less, planted with bamboo; the said parcel is bounded on the north by the beach; on the south by lands of Sr. Catalbas and the road leading to Tabaao; on the west by lands of Sra. Leoncia Catalbas and Sr. Mariano de la Paz; and on the east by lands of the said Sr. Catalbas.<br\/><br\/>\"In witness whereof, as such attorney-in-fact I issue the present in Sagay on the 10th of August, 1902.-pp.\u00a0 Pedro Catalbas.\"-An unintelligible signature follows.-(The words one year, corrected.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Quintin Catalbas having before him the document lettered C, said that the signatures which appeared at the foot of the same appeared to be his own, and although he said that he did not recollect having signed such a document, he added that he remembered signing many documents in favor of the defendant, and that he was actually attorney-in-fact for his father by virtue of a power of attorney executed by the latter in 1898, a date long prior to that of the said document.<br\/><br\/>The case does not present any rational or legal reason opposed to the action of the lower court in adjudging that the signatures of Quintin Catalbas, as affixed to the said document marked C are genuine and authentic, in view of those written by him in the presence of the court, with which they were compared; and on his part, the defendant affirmed under oath that he had received the said document from Quintin Catalbas signed by him.\u00a0 The witnesses Mariano Paz and Joaquin Galicia recognized the signatures as those of Quintin Catalbas, and the witness first named furthermore avers that he was present when Quintin signed the aforesaid document.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the dominion of the defendant over the land in question has also been duly recognized by Pedro Catalbas through his attorney-in-fact, and for this reason, when the ownership of the Hacienda Antipolo was transferred to Mariano Devesa, and subsequently to Juan Sison, the parcel of land of said defendant was not included; indeed, according to the affidavit filed by the original owner, Pedro Catalbas, and certain proceedings for the attachment of said property, certified copies of which were produced at the trial, this land is cited as one of the adjoining properties to the said hacienda.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, the ownership alleged by the defendant appears corroborated, without any sort of contradiction, by the contents of the certified copies of the proceedings that were offered in evidence at the trial as Exhibit F, from which it appears, that, as the said parcel of land was attached as the property of Juan Sison, bondsman of Enrique Catalbas, and principal insolvent debtor, the defendant Faustino Ramos, as owner of the land, and third party whose prejudice was at issue, objected to the levy and on the 20th of February, 1906, moved for the release of the attachment; the sheriff was obliged to accede to the claim and admit the right of the intervening party; in view thereof the municipal president, on the motion of the sheriff, ordered by means of a commissioner the return and delivery of the property to Ramos, the intervener.<br\/><br\/>In view of the allegations of the defendant in defense of his rights, that as such owner he has been in the quiet, peaceful and uninterrupted possession of the said parcel of land from 1884, in which year he purchased it from the original owners, up to the present day, the court below rightly considered, that even supposing that Catalbas and his successors were the owners of the land claimed (and it has been seen that the contrary is the case), Ramos has acquired the ownership by prescription through possession for more than twenty years with good faith and by virtue of a just title; which is the nature of the legal means for the acquisition of real estate as contained in the documents marked A and B.\u00a0 The fact that the latter are merely private documents is not a bar to the consideration of the contracts contained in them as a just title.<br\/><br\/>In the decision rendered in case No. 4274, Alano <i>vs<\/i>. Babasa (10 Phil. Rep., 511), the following rule was laid down:<br\/><i><\/i><blockquote><i>\"Essential elements of a contract<\/i>-A contract in which the three requisites imposed by article 1261 of the Civil Code are present is valid, perfect, and efficient, and, notwithstanding the fact that it was drawn up in the form of a private document, it is, however, binding as provided by article 1278 of said code.<br\/><br\/><i>\"Contract:\u00a0 public or private document; registration<\/i>.-The legalization by a public writing and the recording of the same in the registry are not essential requisites of a contract entered into, as between the parties, but mere conditions of form or solemnities which the law imposes in order that such contract may be valid as against third persons, and to insure that a publicly executed and recorded agreement shall be respected by the latter.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In its decision of July 12, 1904, the supreme court of Spain, in applying certain articles of the Civil Code in force in these Islands which relate to this case laid down the following rule:<br\/><blockquote>\"That, as it has been repeatedly held by the supreme court, it is not within the scope of article 1280 to require, in order to prove the dominion, that a contract shall appear in a public instrument, inasmuch as according to article 1278, all contracts which contain the conditions of validity to which article 1261 refers, produce full effect as between the contracting parties, without prejudice to their right to demand and obtain that they be set out in a public instrument as provided by article 1279; the absence of said requisite can not be availed by either of such parties, and much less by a third person, to deny the existence and reality of the contract when it is supported by elements of proof admissible in law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Even supposing that the plaintiff Sison, who succeeded Devesa and Catalbas in the dominion of the Hacienda Antipolo, was the lawful owner of the parcel of land sued for-an unfounded supposition, as has already been demonstrated-the provisions of article 1949 of the Civil Code and article 35 of the Mortgage Law do not include or affect the lawful owner of the realty or right that is the object of the prescription, nor those who derive their rights from him; by the said article of the special law the lawful owner of the property is not considered as a third person, as held by the supreme court in its decision of January 11, 1888, because the precept of the code is only efficacious with respect to third persons so qualified in accordance with the provisions of the Mortgage Law; and it does not nor can it in any manner govern with respect to the owner of the property that is the subject of prescription, or his successors, by universal or separate title; by the common law the time for prescription to the prejudice of the same shall be counted as provided for by the fourth and last paragraph of article 35 of said law, which is an exception to the rule contained in article 27, that is to say, from the commencement of the possession under title of ownership, although the title by virtue of which it prescribed may not have been registered.<br\/><br\/>It should also be noticed that the title by composition of Pedro Catalbas is the only one which appears to have been temporarily recorded in the registry, while those of the later acquisition by Mariano Devesa and Juan Sison do not seem to have been so recorded; for this reason the latter, as plaintiff, can not be considered as a third person, as described in the Mortgage Law, in view of the fact that his title was not recorded; but even if it had been recorded, the plaintiff, as the pretended owner of the land in question is not comprehended in the said articles of the code and Mortgage Law, as such third person, and prescription to hist prejudice is in accordance\u00a0 with the law even by virtue of titles not recorded in the registry of property, as those contained in the said documents A and B of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>With the foregoing, it has been demonstrated, in our opinion, how unfounded are the errors attributed to the judgment appealed from, and it Should be noted that though the ownership of the property unduly claimed by the plaintiff was satisfactorily proven, nevertheless, this decision has dwelt on the questions set up by said plaintiff relative to the prescription and to matter of third persons whose rights might be affected by such prescription, for the reason that it is so required by the nature and the conditions of a decision rendered on appeal to the second instance, as in this case.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing considerations and of those contained in the judgment of the court below, it is our opinion that the same should be and hereby is affirmed with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

No. 4971, September 23, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF, <i>VS.<\/i> AUGUSTUS HICKS, DEFENDANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">For about five years, from September, 1902, to November, 1907,\u00a0 Augustus Hicks, an Afro-American, and Agustina Sola, a Christian Moro woman, illicitly lived together in the municipality of Parang, Cotabato, Moro Province, until trouble arising between them in the last-mentioned month of 1907, Agustina quitted Hick's house, and, separating from him, went to live with her brother-in-law, Luis Corrales.\u00a0 A few days later she contracted new relations with another negro named Wallace Current, a corporal in the Army who then went to live with her in the said house.<br\/><br\/>On the 21st of December following, at about 7.30 p. m., Augustus Hicks together with a soldier named Lloyd Nickens called at said house, and from the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sala <\/span>called out to his old mistress who was in her room with Corporal Current, and after conversing with her in the Moro dialect for a few minutes, asked the corporal to come out of said room; in response thereto the corporal appeared at the door of the room, and after a short conversation, Current approached Hicks and they shook hands, when Hicks asked him the following question:\u00a0 \"Did I not tell you to leave this woman alone?,\" to which Current replied:\u00a0 \"That is all right, she told me that she did not want to live with you any longer, but if she wishes, she may quit me, and you can live with her.\"\u00a0 The accused then replied: \"God damn, I have made up my mind;\" and as Corporal Current saw that Hicks, when he said this, was drawing a revolver from his trousers' pocket, he caught him by the hand, but the latter, snatching his hand roughly away, said:\u00a0 \"Don't do that,\" whereupon Current jumped into the room, hiding himself behind the partition, just as Hicks drew his revolver and fired at Agustina Sola who was close by in the <i>sala<\/i> of the house.\u00a0 The bullet struck her in the left side of the breast; she fell to the ground, and died in a little more than an hour later.<br\/><br\/>Upon hearing the shot Edward Robinson, who was also in the house, went to render assistance and wrested the weapon from the hand of the accused.\u00a0 The latter immediately fled from the house and gave himself up to the chief of police of the town, H. L. Martin, asking him to lock him up in jail; and, when a few minutes later a policeman came running in and reported that Hicks had fired a shot at Agustina, the said chief of police caused Hicks to be arrested.\u00a0 The latter, when once in jail, threw eight revolver cartridges out of the window; these were picked up by a policeman who reported the occurrence and delivered the cartridges to his chief.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing the provincial fiscal on the 8th of February, 1908, filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance of said province charging Augustus Hicks with the crime of murder.\u00a0 Proceedings were instituted, the trial court, after hearing the evidence adduced, entered judgment on the 10th of September of the same year, sentencing the accused to the penalty of death, to be executed according to the law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of Pl,000, and to pay the costs.\u00a0 The case has been submitted to this court for review.<br\/><br\/>The above-stated facts, which have been fully proven in the present case, constitute the crime of murder, defined and punished by article 403 of the Penal Code, in that the woman Agustina Sola met a violent death, with the qualifying circumstance of treachery (<i>alevosia<\/i>), she being suddenly and roughly attacked and unexpectedly fired upon with a 45-caliber revolver, at close, if not point blank range, while the injured woman was unarmed and unprepared, and at a time when she was listening to a conversation, in which she was concerned, between her aggressor and a third person, and after usual and customary words had passed between her and her aggressor.\u00a0 From all of the foregoing it is logically inferred that means, manners, and forms were employed in the attack that directly and specially insured the consummation of the crime without such risk to the author thereof as might have been offered by the victim who, owing to the suddenness of the attack, was doubtless unable to flee from the place where she was standing, or even escape or divert the weapon.<br\/><br\/>The accused, Augustus Hicks, pleaded not guilty, but notwithstanding his exculpatory allegations which were certainly not borne out at the trial, the evidence in the case is absolutely at variance therewith and conclusively establishes, beyond peradventure of doubt, his culpability as the sole fully convicted author of the violent and treacherous death of his former mistress, Agustina Sola.<br\/><br\/>It is alleged by the accused that when he\u00a0 withdrew his hand from that of Current, who had seized him, he fell backward but managed to support himself on his two hands, and when he got up again the said corporal threatened him with a revolver thrust into his face; whereupon he also drew his revolver, just as Edward Robinson caught him from behind, when his revolver went off, the bullet striking the deceased.<br\/><br\/>This allegation appears to be at variance with the testimony of the witnesses Wallace Current, Edward Robinson, Luis Corrales, and Lloyd Nickens in their respective declarations, especially with that of the second and third, who witnessed the actual firing of the shot by the aggressor at the deceased, as shown by the fact that Robinson immediately approached the accused in order to take his weapon away from him which he succeeded in doing after a brief struggle, whereupon the aggressor ran out of the house.\u00a0 Thus, the shot that struck the deceased in the breast and caused her death was not due to an accident but to a willful and premeditated act on the part of the aggressor with intent to deprive the victim of her life.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the qualifying circumstance of treachery, as above referred to, the presence of other aggravating circumstances, such as premeditation, and the fact that the crime was committed in the dwelling of the deceased should be taken into consideration.\u00a0 The last-mentioned circumstance appears proven from the testimony of several witnesses who were examined at the trial of the case.<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as in the present case the crime has already been qualified as committed with treachery, the circumstance of premeditation should only be considered as a merely generic one.\u00a0 Premeditation is, however, manifest and evident by reason of the open acts executed by the accused.\u00a0 According to the testimony of Charles Gatchey and Eugenio R. Whited, Hicks asked leave from the former to be absent from the canteen where he was working on the morning of the day when the affray occurred, alleging that his mind was unsettled and that he feared getting into trouble.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 also shown by the fact that Whited, who was in Hicks' house about noon upon the Jatter's invitation, and while both where drinking gin, and while the revolver, the instrument of the crime, was lying on the table on which were also several loaded cartridges, heard the accused repeatedly say, referring to the deceased, that her time had come, adding that he would rather see her dead than in the arms of another man, and when the accused went to bed apparently very much worried, and refusing to answer when called, the witness left him.\u00a0 On the day\u00a0 after the crime the\u00a0 police found on a table in the cuprit's house several loaded cartridges, a bottle of oil and a piece of cloth used undoubtedly for cleaning the revolver.<br\/><br\/>All the foregoing circumstances conclusively prove that the accused, deliberately and after due reflection had resolved to kill the woman who had left him for another man, and in order to accomplish his perverse intention with safety, notwithstanding the fact that he was already provided with a clean and well-prepared weapon and carried other loaded cartridges besides those already in his revolver, he entered the house, greeting everyone courteously and conversed with his victim, in what appeared to be a proper manner, disguising his intention and calming her by his apparent repose and tranquillity, doubtless in order to successfully accomplish his criminal design, behaving himself properly as he had planned to do beforehand.<br\/><br\/>As against the two foregoing aggravating circumstances no mitigating circumstance is present, not even that mentioned in paragraph 7 of article 9 of the Penal Code, to wit, loss of reason and self-control produced by jealousy as alleged by the defense, inasmuch as the only causes which mitigate the criminal responsibility for the loss of self-control are such as originate from legitimate feelings, not those which arise from vicious, unworthy, and immoral passions.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing considerations, and as the judgment appealed from is in accordance with the law, it is our opinion that the same should be affirmed, as we do hereby affirm it with costs, provided, however, that the death penalty shall be executed\u00a0 according to the law in force, and that in the event of a pardon being granted, the culprit shall suffer the accessory penalties of article 53 of the Penal Code unless the same be expressly remitted\u00a0 in the pardon.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that of this amount she paid P64,326.92, the value of the property mortgaged, and P3,055, the value of the carabaos and other personal property sold, making a total sum of P67,381.92, which, deducted from the first amount, leaves a balance of P8,038.62.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That the sum of P200 was charged in the account, Exhibit B, of the plaintiff, as fees of the attorney for that company, the amount of P1,500 having been already awarded it as costs in a prior suit; therefore this sum of P200 should be deducted from that of P8,038.62, thus reducing the amount of the latter to P7,838.62 \"as a final balance of the defendant in favor of the plaintiff on September 12, 1906, with interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, agreed to in Exhibit A, which is the basis or ground of the contract between Do\u00f1a Romana Ganzon and the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos, such balance being a consequence of said contract between the parties to the suit.\" (B. of E., 5.)<br\/><br\/>And the court rendered the following decision:<br\/><blockquote>\"The court sentences Romana Ganzon to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P7,838.62, with interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent from the 12th day of September, 1906, until payment is made.\u00a0 To the payment of this sum and its interest, as well as that of the sum of P500 which is hereby adjudged to the plaintiff as costs, there shall be applied the net profits of the sugar obtained from the attached cane of the defendant, and of the personal and movable property also attached at the Hacienda San Jose on account of this suit, and in case this should be insufficient, the necessary amount of the proceeds from the sale of the defendant's attached right of repurchase of said hacienda shall also be applied to the payment of this judgment, and the receiver is hereby ordered immediately to render an account of the sugar produced in said hacienda.\u00a0 The execution of this judgment, if it becomes final, shall not be ordered until that account be filed and approved by the court.\u00a0 Furthermore, by virtue of the attachment of the right of repurchase of the defendant on the Hacienda San Jose, the period of the repurchase is suspended until this judgment becomes final, such suspension to be understock as being effective from May 10 last.\"\u00a0 (B. of E., 6.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The sum of P11,093.62, claimed in the complaint, having been reduced by this judgment to P7,838.62, the plaintiff, as may be seen, has agreed to this part of the judgment and only claims as error therein:<br\/><ol><li>In so far as it is decreed therein \"that the net profits of the sugar produced by the cane attached from the appellee should be applied to the payment of the balance adjudicated to the appellant.\"<br\/><\/li><li>In so far as it is also ordered \"that to the payment of the debt of the appellee there shall be applied, the necessary amount from the proceeds of the sale of the right of repurchase of the Hacienda San Jose that was sold at public auction by virtue of the foreclosure of mortgage on September 12, 1906.\"<br\/><\/li><li>In so far as it has suspended the right of repurchase of the Hacienda San Jose.<br\/><\/li><\/ol>And the plaintiff alleges:\u00a0 That the court should have limited itself to rendering a judgment in favor of the plaintiff without in addition providing the form of the execution; that the court could not order the application of the value of the sugar produced by the attached cane, because the plaintiff contends that this cane is its own, or at least until it has been finally held that it does not belong to the plaintiff; that the action brought in this case (No. 249 of the court) is purely personal, not one of mortgage, as is that instituted in the other (No. 85); that there is no right of repurchase in the execution of a judgment of foreclosure of mortgage, in which it differs from a simple execution resulting from a personal action; that, therefore, the value of the right of repurchase, in the matter of the sale at<br\/>public auction made in case No. 85, which was the result of a mortgage action, could not be ordered applied to the payment of the execution of this judgment; that there is no law authorizing the court below to suspend, in its discretion, the right to repurchase the Hacienda San Jose.<br\/><br\/>The trial court has not incurred in the first error, since section 436 of the Code of Civil Procedure expressly authorizes it to order the sale of the property attached in this suit.<br\/><br\/>Neither has it incurred in the second error for the same reason. As to whether or not the right to repurchase mortgaged property sold at public auction exists, this is a question that can not be decided at present by this court; it was not brought up on appeal and was neither presented to nor decided by the court below.<br\/><br\/>However, the order of the court relating to this right of repurchase is the outcome of the attachment of the said right; the attachment was admitted by the appellant in saying in its brief (p. 10):\u00a0 \"This attachment matters nothing * * * not by our attachment of it (the right to repurchase) nor by our admission would it be created.\"\u00a0 Whether it should not legally exist and whether it was not created, are questions to be decided by the court only; but we have to deal with a juridical act which, so long as it is not declared null and void, as such a juridical act serves for something and, with respect to the parties who have executed it and consented thereto, is of course efficient and binding in its effects and consequences.<br\/><br\/>If it was actually attached the same as was the sugar cane, at the instance of the appellant, the latter can not evade the consequences and efficiency of its own act, nor did the court exceed its powers, in.making use of that conferred upon it by the said section 436, which deals with the final disposition of attached property.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the suspension of the term of the right to repurchase, by virtue of the conclusive presumptions:\u00a0 \"16-That all the matters within an issue in an action were laid before the court and passed upon by it;\" and \"31-That the law has been obeyed,\" there being no proof or allegation to the contrary, this court must find that the court below, considering that the attachment of a right implies an inhibition or privation of its exercise, and that, the right of redemption being attached, it could not be exercised during the period of attachment, and while the litigation was pending, could, by virtue of the principle that a prescriptive term shall not run against him who can not act, fix the period during which the legal term for the exercise of that right which was suspended by reason of its attachment should not run.<br\/><br\/>The findings of the court below, impugned in this appeal, are, according to the assignment of errors of the appellant, as follows:<br\/><ol><li>The application, to the payment of the sentence, of the net proceeds of the sugar obtained from the attached cane of the defendant.<br\/><\/li><li>The application to that payment, in the second place, of the value at the sale, in the necessary amount, of the right to redeem the said hacienda, which right was attached from the defendant.<br\/><\/li><li>The suspension of the term for redemption from May 10, 1907, until the judgment in this case becomes final.<br\/><\/li><\/ol>All the other findings having been accepted, we decide that we should affirm the decision with regard to the three findings objected to in the brief of the appellant, with the costs of this instance against the said appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa<\/i>, and<i> Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

September, 1905.\u00a0 The defendant appealed.\u00a0 On the 12th day of October, 1905, the appellant filed his printed bill of exceptions with the clerk of the Supreme Court.\u00a0 On the 5th day of December, 1905, the appellant filed his brief with the clerk of the Supreme Court.\u00a0 On the 19th day of January, 1906, the Attorney-General filed his brief in said cause.\u00a0 Nothing further was done in said cause until on or about the 30th day of January, 1909, when the respective parties were requested by this court to prosecute the appeal under penalty of having the same dismissed for failure so to do; whereupon the appellant, by petition, had the cause placed upon the calendar and the same was heard on the 2d day of February, 1909.<br\/><br\/>The facts from the record appear to be as follows:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That on or about the 17th day of April, 1903, in the city of Chicago, in the State of Illinois, in the United States, the defendant, through a representative of the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands, entered into a contract for a period of two years with the plaintiff, by which the defendant was to receive a salary of 1,200 dollars per year as a stenographer in the service of the said plaintiff, and in addition thereto was to be paid in advance the expenses incurred in traveling from the said city of Chicago to Manila, and one-half salary during said period of travel.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 Said contract contained a provision that in case of a violation of its terms on the part of the defendant, he should become liable to the plaintiff for the amount expended by the Government by way of expenses incurred in traveling from Chicago to Manila and the one-half salary paid during such period.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 The defendant entered upon the performance of his contract upon the 30th day of April, 1903, and was paid half-salary from that date until June 4,1903, the date of his arrival in the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 That on the 11th day of February, 1904, the defendant left the service of the plaintiff and refused to make a further compliance with the terms of the contract.<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 On the 3d day of December, 1904, the plaintiff commenced an action in the Court of First Instance\u00a0 of the city of Manila to\u00a0 recover from the defendant the sum of 269.23 dollars, which amount the plaintiff claimed had been paid to the defendant as expenses incurred in traveling from Chicago to Manila, and as half salary for the period consumed in travel.<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 It was expressly agreed between the parties to said contract that Laws No. 80 and No. 224\u00a0 should constitute a part of said contract.<br\/><br\/>To the complaint of the plaintiff the defendant filed a general denial and a special defense, alleging in his special defense that the Government of the Philippine Islands had amended Laws No. 80 And No. 224 and had thereby materially altered the said contract, and also that he was a minor at the time the contract was entered into and was therefore not responsible under the law.<br\/><br\/>To the special defense of the defendant the plaintiff filed a demurrer, which demurrer the court sustained.<br\/><br\/>Upon the issue thus presented, and after hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the lower court rendered a judgment against the defendant and in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of 265.90 dollars.\u00a0 The lower court found that at the time the defendant quit the service of the plaintiff there was due him from the said plaintiff the sum of 3.33 dollars, leaving a balance due the plaintiff in the sum of 265.90 dollars.\u00a0 From this judgment the defendant appealed and made the following assignments of error;<br\/><ol><li>The court erred in sustaining plaintiff's demurrer to defendant's special defenses.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The court erred in rendering judgment against the defendant on the facts.<br\/><\/li><\/ol>With reference to the above assignments of error, it may be said that the mere fact that the legislative department of the Government of the Philippine Islands had amended said Acts No. 80 and No. 224 by Acts No. 643 and No. 1040 did not have the effect of changing the terms of the contract made between the plaintiff and the defendant.\u00a0 The legislative department of the Government is expressly prohibited by section 5 of the Act of Congress of 1902 from altering or changing the terms of a contract.\u00a0 The right\u00a0 which the defendant had acquired by virtue of Acts No. 80 and No. 224 had not been changed in any respect by the fact that said laws had been amended.\u00a0 These acts, constituting the terms of the contract, still constituted a part of said contract and were enforceable in favor of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The defendant alleged in his special defense that he was a minor and therefore the contract could not be enforced against him.\u00a0 The record discloses that, at the time the contract was entered into in the State of Illinois, he was an adult under the laws of that State and had full authority to contract.\u00a0 The plaintiff [the defendant] claims that, by reason of the fact that, under the laws of the Philippine Islands at the time the contract was made, male persons in said Islands did not reach their majority until they had attained the age of 23 years, he was not liable under said contract, contending that the laws of the Philippine Islands governed.\u00a0 It is not disputed-upon the contrary the fact is admitted-that at the time and place of the making of the contract in question the defendant had full capacity to make the same.\u00a0 No rule is better settled in law than that matters bearing upon the execution, interpretation and validity of a contract are determined by the law of the place where the contract is made.\u00a0 (Scudder <i>vs<\/i>. Union National Bank, 91\u00a0 U. S., 406.)\u00a0 Matters connected with its performance are regulated by the law prevailing at the place of performance.\u00a0 Matters respecting a remedy, such as the bringing of suit, admissibility of evidence, and statutes of limitations, depend upon the law of the place where the suit is brought.\u00a0 (<i>Idem<\/i>.)<br\/><br\/>The defendant's claim that he was an adult when he left Chicago but was a minor when he arrived at Manila; that he was an adult at the time he made the contract but was a minor at the time the plaintiff attempted to enforce the contract, more than a year later, is not tenable.<br\/><br\/>Our conclusions with reference to the first above assignment of error are, therefore:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the amendments to Acts No. 80 and No. 224 in no way affected the terms of the contract in question; and<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 The plaintiff [defendant] being fully qualified to enter into the contract at the place and time the contract was made, he can not plead infancy as a defense at the place where the contract is being enforced.<br\/><br\/>We believe that the above conclusions also dispose of the second assignment of error.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above stated, the judgment of the lower court is affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Co., Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Moll, Kunzli &amp; Co., and Lutz &amp; Co. appeared and claimed that a portion of the merchandise found in said store and which had been levied upon by the said sheriff, had been sold by them to the judgment debtor and had not been paid for.\u00a0 The Collector of Internal Revenue appeared and made the claim that the internal-revenue tax had not been paid for the first <i>trimestre<\/i> of the year 1908.\u00a0 Yu Guioc Lo and Be Yoaju appeared and made the claim to the sheriff that the rent\u00a0 for the building occupied by the judgment debtor had not been paid for the months of January, February, March, and April of the year 1908.\u00a0 The defendants, Ng Boc Pun, Ng Liong and Ng Chee Yan appeared and made the claim to the sheriff that they were employees of the judgment debtor and that their salaries had not been paid.\u00a0 Prior to the time and just before the sale was made, each of the above defendants, who claimed that he had sold merchandise to the judgment debtor, went through the merchandise found in the said store and selected various articles of merchandise which he claimed he had sold to the judgment debtor and which had not yet been paid for.\u00a0 The goods so selected by the said defendants were separated from the general mass of merchandise found in said store, and were sold separately from the other merchandise by the sheriff.\u00a0 The merchandise selected by Holliday, Wise &amp; Co. and sold separately brought the sum ofP216.25.\u00a0 The merchandise selected by Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. sold for the sum of P2,984.96.\u00a0 The goods selected by Moll, Kunzli &amp; Co. sold for the sum of P900.\u00a0 The goods selected by Lutz &amp; Co. sold for the sum of P700.\u00a0 The claim of the Collector of Internal Revenue for the first trimestre\u00a0 of the year 1908 amounted to P178.84.\u00a0 The rent of the building occupied by the judgment debtor for the months of January, February, March, and a portion of the month of April, amounted to P721.\u00a0 The salary claimed by Ng Boc Pun, Ng Liong and Ng Chee Yan, respectively, was P502.57, P600, and P720.\u00a0 All of the merchandise found in said store and sold under the said execution brought the sum of P7,012.89, which amount is now in the hands of the sheriff.\u00a0 Each of the above defendants claims a preferred right to have his respective claim paid first out of the said sum of money.\u00a0 The sheriff being unable or unwilling to settle the question of their respective rights filed a petition in the present cause in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila.\u00a0 Each of the above defendants appeared and answered, setting forth substantially the facts above related.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence of the respective parties, the lower court found that the goods selected by Holliday, Wise &amp; Co., Behn, Meyer &amp;\u00a0 Co., Moll, Kunzli &amp; Co., and Lutz &amp; Co. had been sold by them, respectively, to the judgment debtor and that the same had not been paid for, and that they were each entitled to a preference of payment out of the funds in the hands of the sheriff in an amount equal to the amount which each received for the said goods.<br\/><br\/>The lower court further found that the defendant, the Collector of Internal Revenue, was entitled to the amount of taxes due on the business of said store for the first quarter of the year 1908, and\u00a0 that the amount of said taxes was P178.84, and that.he was also entitled to be paid that amount out of the funds in the hands of the sheriff.<br\/><br\/>The lower court further found that the defendants Yu Guioc Lo, and Be Yoaju were the owners of the building in which said merchandise was located, and had a right to be paid, as a preferred credit out of the money in the hands of the sheriff, the rent due for the months of January, February, March, and a portion of April, amounting to the sum of P721.<br\/><br\/>The lower court held that the\u00a0 other defendants, Ng Boc Pun, Ng Liong, and Ng Chee Yan, were entitled to a proportional amount out of the balance of the funds in the hands of the sheriff, in accordance with their preferred claims.<br\/><br\/>From this judgment the defendant Domingo Tremoya duly appealed to this court and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"I.\u00a0 The court erred in deciding that the credits of the appellant's codefendants are entitled to preference over appellant's credit.<br\/><br\/>\"II.\u00a0 The court erred in not directing the sheriff to apply the funds in his possession derived from the sale of the property of the Chinaman Lim Buanco, to the payment of the appellant's judgment against said Lim Buanco.<br\/><br\/>\"III.\u00a0 The court erred in denying appellant's motion for a new trial.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>With reference to the first assignment of error the appellant makes the point that the validity of the claims of the different defendants must depend upon three essential elements, namely:<br\/><br\/>(a)\u00a0 \"The money claimed must be due the creditor as the selling price of the property from which it proceeds\";<br\/><br\/>(b)\u00a0 \"It must be capable of identification and identified as the selfsame property whose selling price is unpaid\"; and<br\/><br\/>(c)\u00a0 \"The property upon which the selling price was due must be found in the possession of the debtor.\"<br\/><br\/>Evidently the appellant admits that under the provisions of articles 1921 and 1922 of the Civil Code, claims of the nature of those of the defendants, Holliday, Wise &amp; Co., Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Moll., Kunzli &amp; Co., and Lutz &amp; Co., were entitled to a preference, providing their claims have the above so-called essentials.\u00a0 It would seem, therefore, that whether the said last-mentioned defendants are entitled to a preference in the present case is purely a question of fact.\u00a0 A preference of claims similar\u00a0 to those of the last-mentioned defendants has been allowed by this court, in accordance with the provisions of said articles of the Civil Code, in the following cases:\u00a0 Torres et al. <i>vs.<\/i> Genato, 7 Phil. Rep., 204; Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino <i>vs.<\/i> Peterson et al., 7 Phil. Rep., 409, 413; Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland <i>vs.<\/i> Wilson et al., 8 Phil.

Rep., 339, 345; International Banking Corporation <i>vs.<\/i> Corrales et al., 10 Phil. Rep., 435, 436.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the first above essential and with special reference to the claim of Holliday, Wise &amp; Co., the lower court found \"that a portion of the goods delivered by Holliday, Wise &amp; Co. to the judgment debtor had not bees paid for, and that of the goods not paid for there was levied upon by the sheriff and afterwards sold separately upon the claim of the said company, goods amounting to P216.25.\"\u00a0 This was the conclusion of the lower\u00a0 court, based upon what he said was a preponderance of the evidence.\u00a0 The appellant claims that the goods which Holliday, Wise &amp; Co. had sold had not been sold to Lim Buanco, the judgment debtor, but to Uy Bo Siong, and calls attention to the bills made out by Holliday, Wise &amp; Co. to support his contention.\u00a0 It is true\u00a0 that the bills of Holliday, Wise &amp; Co., under which the present claim is made, were made out against \"El Chino Uy Bo Siong to Holliday, Wise &amp; Co.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Upon this question the lower court made an express finding, as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"I firid, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the merchandise levied upon was levied upon as that of Lim Buanco, although located in a store which was operated under the name of Uy Bo Siong, but that Lim Buanco owned all of the merchandise in the store.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>We are of the opinion that this finding of fact is in accordance with a preponderance of the evidence adduced during the trial.\u00a0 If Lim Buanco and Uy Bo Siong are two different persons or represent two different business establishments, and if the contention of the appellant is tenable, to wit, that the goods in the store No. 176 Calle Rosario belong to Uy Bo Siong as a different person from Lim Buanco, and not to Lim Buanco, then it would appear that the execution in favor of the appellant as against Lim Buanco had been executed upon property not belonging to\u00a0 Lim Buanco but to Uy Bo Siong.\u00a0 We believe that a preponderance of the evidence fully sustains the finding of the lower court, to wit, that while the store and goods found therein actually belonged to Lim Buanco, the store itself was operated under the name of Uy Bo Siong, and that the bills made out by the different vendors of merchandise to Lim Buanco were made out in the name of the house or store instead of in the name of Lim Buanco.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the claim of Holliday, Wise &amp; Co., the appellant asserts that the record contains no proof whatever that any amount was owing and unpaid to the said firm <i>upon the goods in question<\/i>.\u00a0 The appellant makes the further point that the goods selected by the representative of Holliday, Wise &amp; Go. were goods sold by the said company to the judgment debtor, Lim Buanco.\u00a0\u00a0 It appears from the record that one Uy Piaoco was the manager of the store in question.\u00a0 He testified that the goods had been purchased for the store from Holliday, Wise &amp; Co.\u00a0 He makes no statement whatever with reference to the fact whether the particular goods had been paid for or not.\u00a0 The representative of Holliday, Wise &amp; Co. who selected the forty-one pieces at the time of the execution sale, swears positively that the\u00a0 goods had been sold by Holliday, Wise &amp; Co. to the judgment debtor, but there is no statement by any of the witnesses presented by Holliday, Wise &amp; Co. to the effect that the <i>particular goods selected and sold had not been paid for<\/i>.\u00a0 Paragraph 1 of article 1922 of the Civil Code gives the creditor the right of preference for the price or amount of the sale of personal property which may be in the possession of the debtor.\u00a0 Said provision does not contemplate the right of preference for the payment of a claim which a creditor may have against a debtor.\u00a0 The claim to which preference is given must be a claim for <i>specific personal property found in the possession of the debtor<\/i>.\u00a0 The\u00a0 mere fact that Lim Buanco owed Hoiliday, Wise &amp; Co.. a sum of money for goods sold and delivered, would not justify the said company in entering the store and <i>claiming any of the goods which were there found which they had sold.\u00a0 They must prove that the particular goods were not only sold to the debtor, but that the price of the particular goods selected had not been paid before they were entitled to the right of preference as provided in said article of the Civil Code<\/i>.\u00a0 There being no proof, therefore, that the <i>particular goods selected by<\/i> Hoiliday, Wise &amp; Co. <i>had not been paid for<\/i>, they did not have a preferred right over the money received for the sale of the goods selected and sold.\u00a0 Therefore, the judgment of the lower court, granting to Holliday, Wise &amp;\u00a0 Co. the payment of P216.25 out of the funds in the hands of the sheriff as a preferred credit or claim, is hereby\u00a0 revoked.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the claims of Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Moll, Kunzli &amp; Co., and Lutz &amp; Co., we are of the opinion, from an examination of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, that there is a preponderance of evidence showing that these companies had sold the goods selected, to the said judgment debtor, and that the particular goods selected had not been paid for.\u00a0 These companies brought themselves within the requirements of the provision of paragraph 1 of said article 1922 of the Civil Code and therefore the judgment of the lower court with reference to each of these particular last-mentioned parties is hereby affirmed.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the claims of Yu Guioc Lo and Be Yoaju, it appears from the record that these parties are the owners of the building in which the store in question was located and that there was due to them from Lim Buanco and Uy Bo Siong rent amounting to P210 per month for the months of January, February, March, and a portion of the month of April.\u00a0 Claims of this character are expressly recognized as preferred claims against a debtor by paragraph 7 of article 1922 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 The lower court allowed the claim of these defendants as a preferred credit against the money in the hands of the sheriff in a sum amounting to P721.\u00a0 The record brought to this court fully justifies the judgment of the lower court and his judgment with reference to this particular claim is therefore hereby affirmed.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the claims of Ng Boc Pun, Ng Liong and Ng Chee Yan, who were employees in the store of Lim Buanco and Uy Bo Siong, the appellant undertakes to say that the salaries which these employees claim are exorbitant and fictitious.\u00a0 The lower court found that there was due as salary to Ng Boc Pun the sum of K02.67; to Ng Liong, the sum of P615.67, and to Ng Chee Yan, the sum of P850, and allowed these claims as preferred claims against the sum of money in the hands of the sheriff.\u00a0 The preferred rights of these claimants is recognized by subparagraph (d) of paragraph 2 of article 1924 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 With reference to the justice of these claims there is nothing in the record which would justify this court in modifying the finding of the lower court.\u00a0 The lower court decided that these claims should be paid out of the balance of the money in the hands of the sheriff, in proportion to the respective\u00a0 amounts.\u00a0 In this conclusion, the claims being of equal character, the lower court committed no error.\u00a0 Therefore the judgment of the lower court with reference to the claims of Ng Boc Pun, Ng Liong and Ng Chee Yan, is hereby affirmed.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, and for the reasons above stated, the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, except that part of the judgment which allows the claim of P16.25 in favor of Holliday, Wise &amp; Co. which is hereby reversed, and without any special finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

(<i>a<\/i>) If the number of barrios in a municipality is less than or equal to the number of councilors the council shall put each of its members in immediate charge of a barrio or part of a barrio, so that each barrio shall be under the direction of one or more councilors.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>) If the number of barrios exceeds the number of councilors, including the vice-president, the council shall group the barrios into as many districts as there are councilors, and shall place each councilor in charge of one such district.\u00a0 Each councilor shall be empowered to appoint one lieutenant in each barrio or part of barrio which comes under his immediate supervision.\u00a0 A lieutenant of barrio shall serve without compensation and shall report directly to the councilor appointing him.<br\/><br\/>\"Sec. 38. (<i>a<\/i>) Each councilor shall keep the people of his barrio or barrios informed as to the acts of the council, or other governmental measures which directly concern them, by means of suitable notices posted in a public and conspicuous place in each barrio.\u00a0 He shall serve in the council as the representative of the people of his barrio or barrios and shall bring their special needs to the attention of that body.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>) He shall further promptly inform the president of any unusual or untoward event occurring within the barrios assigned to him.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>c<\/i>) He is authorized to use as a symbol of office a cane with silver head, plated ferule and black cord and tassels.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It will not be doubted that under these provisions of law, a lieutenant of a barrio, duly appointed by the councilor in charge of such barrio, is clothed with all the authority of the councilor himself within the limits of such barrio, subject, of course, to the commands of his principal.\u00a0 But it must be admitted that the authority expressly and explicitly conferred upon a councilor in charge of a barrio, within such barrio, would appear, upon a superficial examination of the above-cited sections of Act No. 82, to be somewhat limited, and to be confined to the keeping of the people of his barrio informed of acts of the council, and other governmental measures which directly concern them, and informing the <i>presidente<\/i> of any unusual or untoward event occurring within the barrio assigned to him.\u00a0 We are of opinion, however, that it was not the intention of the lawmaker to limit the functions of municipal councilors within such narrow boundaries, and that the provisions of section 37 which put one or more barrios in <i>immediate charge<\/i> of each councilor, so that each barrio shall <i>be under the direction<\/i> of one or more councilors, and authorizes and empowers each councilor to appoint one lieutenant in each barrio or part of barrio \"which comes under his immediate supervision,\" must be understood as conferring upon, or confirming to municipal councilors functions of wider scope and higher import than those with which they are explicitly charged in section 38.<br\/><br\/>To say that \"each of the members of the council shall be put in <i>immediate charge<\/i> of a barrio or part of barrio, so that each barrio shall be <i>under the direction<\/i> of one or more councilors\" and that each barrio is placed \"under the immediate supervision of a councilor\" would seem necessarily to imply a grant of some degree of control over the conduct of the residents of the barrio by the councilor placed in charge thereof.\u00a0 Certainly it implies something more than a mere authority and obligation to post notices of acts of the council and other governmental measures and to inform the municipal president of unusual or untoward events occurring in the barrio; and taking into consideration the general provisions of Act No. 82, entitled \"A general Act for the organization of municipal governments in the Philippine Islands,\" which divides the greater part of these Islands into municipalities and each of these municipalities into barrios, and places these barrios under the charge of designated councilors and lieutenants of barrios, adopting in this respect the general scheme of the Spanish system of municipal administration in existence when the Act was promulgated; and keeping in mind, first, the imperative necessity for providing for the maintenance of order in each of these barrios, many of which are located at long distances from the centers of population, where the municipal officials reside; second, the fact that nowhere else in the Act is any provision made for the appointment of peace officers for the various barrios with the necessary authority to maintain order; and, third, the fact that under the municipal system which was superseded by the system provided in this Act, municipal councilors and their lieutenants placed in charge of particular barrios were always recognized as <i>agentes de la autoridad<\/i> and clothed with the necessary authority for the maintenance of order and the protection of life and property; we think that the Commission, in providing for the assignment of one or more councilors in charge of each barrio or part of barrio, so that each barrio shall be under the direction of one or more councilors, must be taken to have entrusted to these councilors and their lieutenants a duty of maintaining order within their respective barrios, substantially similar to that which was imposed upon municipal councilors under the Spanish law existing at the time of the promulgation\u00a0 of the Act, and\u00a0 thus to have conferred upon, or confirmed to them the functions of <i>agentes de la autoridad<\/i> (agents of authority) within their respective barrios, with the necessary authority incident thereto for the maintenance of order and the protection of life and property.<br\/><br\/>There is no express provision of the Municipal Code defining the authority necessarily incident to the duty of maintaining order, and protecting life and property, thus imposed upon these officials within their respective jurisdictions; but the extent and limitations of the authority thus conferred, in so far as it requires the exercise of powers to make arrests without warrant, may be ascertained from an examination of the \"Provisional Law for the Application\u00a0 of the Penal Code,\" as modified\u00a0 and amended by legislation enacted since the American occupation of these Islands.\u00a0 Rules 27, 28, 29, and 30 of this law are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"RULE 27.\u00a0 Anyone may detain:<br\/><br\/>\"First.\u00a0 A person who attempts to commit a crime, when about to commit the same.<br\/><br\/>\"Second.\u00a0 An offender in, <i>flagrante<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"Third.\u00a0 A person who is escaping from the penal establishment where serving sentence.<br\/><br\/>\"Fourth.\u00a0 A prisoner who is escaping from the jail while awaiting transfer to the penal establishment or place where he is to serve the sentence imposed upon him by a final judgment.<br\/><br\/>\"Fifth.\u00a0 A prisoner who is escaping while being transferred to the penal establishment or place referred to in the preceding paragraph.<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 A prisoner who is escaping from confinement while his case is pending.<br\/><br\/>\"Seventh.\u00a0 A defendant in a criminal prosecution or convicted person <i>en rebeldia<\/i> (at large).<br\/><br\/>\"RULE 28.\u00a0 Judicial and administrative authorities have power to detain, or to cause to be detained, persons whom there is reasonable ground to believe guilty of some offense.\u00a0 It will be the duty of the authorities, as well as of their agents, to arrest:<br\/><br\/>\"First.\u00a0 Such persons as may be arrested under the provisions of rule 27.<br\/><br\/>\"Second.\u00a0 A person charged with a crime for which the code provides a penalty greater than that of <i>confinamiento<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"Third.\u00a0 A person charged with a crime for which the code provides a penalty less than that of <i>confinamiento<\/i>, if his antecedents or the circumstances of the case would warrant the presumption that he would fail to appear when summoned by the judicial authorities.<br\/><br\/>\"The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not apply, however, to a defendant who gives sufficient bond, to the satisfaction of the authority or agent who may arrest him, and who it may reasonably be presumed will appear whenever summoned by the judge or court competent to try him.<br\/><br\/>\"Fourth.\u00a0 A person coining under the provisions of the preceding paragraph may be arrested, although no formal complaint has been filed against him, provided the following circumstances are present:<br\/><br\/>\"First.\u00a0 That the authority or agent had reasonable cause to believe that an unlawful act, amounting to a crime had been committed.<br\/><br\/>\"Second.\u00a0 That the authority or agent had sufficient reason to believe that the person arrested participated in the commission of such unlawful act or crime.<br\/><br\/>\"RULE 29.\u00a0 A private individual who detains a person must take or have such person immediately taken to the district jail or to the courthouse of the town, and deliver to the warden of the prison or to the person in charge of such prison, a written statement setting out the cause of the arrest.<br\/><br\/>\"If such private individual is unable to sign, the statement above referred to will be signed by the warden of the prison in the presence of two witnesses.<br\/><br\/>\"RULE 30.\u00a0 The executive authorities or their agents detaining a person shall release the same or else turn him over to the judicial authorities within twenty-four hours after the arrest if made in the head town of the district, or within as brief a period as distance and transportation facilities permit.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>These provisions of Spanish law have never been expressly repealed, and are still in force in so far as they have not been repealed or amended by implication by the enactment of the body of laws put in force in these Islands since the change from Spanish to American sovereignty.\u00a0 They are undoubtedly modified in many respects by the enactment of the Philippine Bill, General Orders, No. 58, the various Acts of the Commission creating courts and judicial offices, defining their jurisdiction and prescribing rules of procedure therefor, the Manila Charter, the Constabulary Act, and other laws which might be cited; but it would be difficult, and for the purposes of this decision it is unnecessary, to state precisely the extent to which these amendments by implication have gone.\u00a0 We can and do hold, however, that they have not gone to the extent of depriving officials who \"by direct provision of law or by appointment of competent authority are charged with the maintenance of public order and the protection and security of life and property,\" of authority to make arrests without warrant such as, in the United States, is generally conferred upon \"peace officers\" and more especially that class of \"peace officers\" known to American and English law as \"constables.\"<br\/><br\/>Section 37 of Act No. 183 (Charter of Manila), which designates certain officials, including police officers, as \"peace officers,\" expressly provides that within the territory defined in the Act they \"may pursue and arrest without warrant, any person found in suspicious places or under suspicious circumstances, reasonably tending to show that such person has committed, or is about to commit any crime or breach of the peace; may arrest, or cause to be arrested without warrant, any offender, when the offense is committed in the presence of a peace officer or within his view.\"\u00a0 These provisions quite clearly set out the powers usually conferred by American and English law upon \"peace officers\" including \"constables,\" in making arrests 'without warrants; and since similar powers are clearly included in the powers conferred upon \"agents of authority\" in the above cited articles of the \"Provisional Law,\" there can be no doubt that the Commission, in imposing the duty of maintaining order and preserving and protecting life and property within their respective barrios upon municipal councilors and their lieutenants of barrios, conferred upon such officials authority to make arrests without warrant not less extensive than that conferred upon peace officers in Manila in the above-cited provisions of the Manila Charter.\u00a0 (The United States <i>vs<\/i>.

C. bright, an agent of the Internal Revenue Service in the district of Pamplona, Province\u00a0 of Cagayan de Luzon, assisted by Damian Magudatu, was engaged in an investigation of a clan-destine distillery, which, according to information received by the said agents, was being conducted by the accused Maquiraya, near a small barrio situated very close to\u00a0 the division line between the pueblos of Abulug and Pamplona.\u00a0 Having reached the locality where he had been informed the distillery was located, he searched the neighborhood very closely and finally discovered the distillery, which, at the time, was being conducted by two girls, a woman, a person by the name of Jorge Mangabilin, and another irian.\u00a0 All of the persons who were in the distillery at the time of its discovery escaped except Mangabilin and the women.\u00a0 The agent, in company with Mangabilin, then went to the latter's house for the purpose of obtaining assistance to remove the effects from the distillery.\u00a0 On the way Mangabilin told Wright that there were other persons associated with him in the operation of the distillery, including Vicente Maquiraya, Fernando Ballatin, Domingo Gumerang, and Jose Acquebay.\u00a0 All of these persons were found at the house of Jorge Mangabilin.\u00a0 Upon his request they agreed to assist the agent in removing and transporting the articles and effects contained in the distillery.\u00a0 For that purpose they accompanied him to the building.\u00a0 Arriving there the persons mentioned began the work requested of them while Wright entered the distillery, sat down upon a bench in one corner thereof and began to make notes and memoranda in a small book in connection with the matter in hand.\u00a0 While so engaged, and intent upon such entries, he was interrupted by seeing a man's foot glide alongside of him from his rear, and, turning to see who was approaching him from that direction, he received a terrible blow in the face from a bolo in the hands of the accused Maquiraya.\u00a0 The wound received was a fearful one, being 6 centimeters in length, passing from the left side of the forehead downward across the face to the lobe of the left ear.\u00a0 The left eye was destroyed instantly and the jawbone cut in two.\u00a0 The accused Maquiraya then attacked Damian Maggudatu and wounded him with the bolo.\u00a0 While these two were engaged in combat Wright, although blinded by his injury and the flow of blood, was able to draw his revolver and fire several shots, wereupon the accused and those who were removing the effects from the distillery ran off.<br\/><br\/>It was also shown upon the trial that, as soon as possible after the accused knew they were to be arrested and tried for the crime of operating the distillery aforesaid, Mangabilin, Diosdatu, Dasil, Jose Acquebay, and others, on the invitation of the accused Maquiraya, entered into an agreement to kill Wright and his companion.\u00a0 This agreement was made while they were at the house of Mangabilin, the accused and the others having gone outside of the house and talked among themselves for a considerable time.<br\/><br\/>These facts were found fully and completely established on the trial of the case.<br\/><br\/>The defense presents two questions:<br\/><br\/>1.\u00a0 The claim is made that Fernando Ballatin and not Maquiraya delivered the blow against Wright.<br\/><br\/>2.\u00a0 That there is no proof of premeditation.<br\/><br\/>As to the first claim the evidence is clear that the assault upon Wright was made by the accused Maquiraya.\u00a0 Wright himself saw him and recognized him clearly at the time the blow was delivered.\u00a0 His testimony is supported by that of Damian Maggudatu, the assistant of Wright, and by the testimony of Fernando Ballatin.\u00a0 As to the second claim, Fernando Ballatin testified that the accused Maquiraya asked him to assist in killing Wright and his companion.\u00a0 While it is necessary to take the declaration of an accomplice with much caution (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Quiamson, 5 Phil. Rep., 444), nevertheless, where such testimony is thoroughly corroborated by the circumstances of the case, it may be given its\u00a0 due weight (U.

Rep., 579).\u00a0 The circumstances corroborating the testimony of Ballatin are:<br\/><br\/>(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">a<\/span>)\u00a0 The accused were all armed with dangerous weapons, were about to be arrested upon a\u00a0 charge\u00a0 on which conviction was absolutely certain and from which would result a long term of imprisonment.<br\/><br\/>(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">b<\/span>)\u00a0 The accused were seen by Wright and his companion engaged at various times in secret conversation, which ceased immediately upon the approach of Wright.<br\/><br\/>(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">c<\/span>)\u00a0 The attempt to kill Wright was actually made and the accused Maquiraya, on making the assault\u00a0 and observing that his companions were not assisting him, said to them, \"What are you doing?\u00a0 Come on and let us kill all of them,\"<br\/><br\/>And lastly, when Wright opened fire with his revolver, not only Maquiraya but all of the accused ran away.<br\/><br\/>The trial court in his decision condemning\u00a0 the appellants says:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"From the proofs in the case there exists in the mind of the court no doubt that it was Vicente Maquiraya who inflicted the wound upon Mr. Wright as alleged in the complaint.\u00a0 The proofs clearly demonstrate that the action was premeditated.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>He further says:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"That it is the crime of frustrated assassination there is no doubt whatever.\u00a0 A simple glance at the face of Mr. Wright, which demonstrates the terrible nature of the wound which he received, extending from the forehead above the eye in a downward direction across the eye to the jawbone on the left\u00a0 side, shows clearly that a blow of that nature could not possibly have been given unless the intention of the one who delivered the blow was to cause the death of the person against whom it was delivered.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defense has introduced some proofs.\u00a0 That all the testimony submitted by the defense is false I have not the slighest doubt.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>We see no reason whatever for disturbing the conclusions of the court above expressed.\u00a0 (Supreme court of Spain, February 17,\u00a0 1871;\u00a0 U.

Rep., 453.)<br\/><br\/>It is apparent, however, that the court erred in convicting Jose Acquebay.\u00a0 It\u00a0 appears from the proof that at the time Wright was assaulted the defendant Jose Acquebay was outside, in front of the distillery, occupied in removing some large earthen jars.\u00a0 It also appears from the testimony of Fernando Ballatin that Jose Acquebay in no way assisted in the assault on Wright.\u00a0 It does not appear that he took part in the arrangement to kill Wright.\u00a0 Under the holdings of this court the evidence produced in this case against Acquebay is not sufficient to sustain a conviction.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Empeinado, 9\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 613; U. S.<i> vs.<\/i> Dasal, 3 Phil. Rep., 6.)<br\/><br\/>In condemning Maquiraya, the court did not take sufficiently into consideration the aggravating circumstance of <i>alevosia<\/i> and that of the crime having been committed in an uninhabited place (<i>en despoblado<\/i>).\u00a0 Mr. Wright testified that the distillery was located in a sparsely settled district at a distance of at least one mile from any habitation.\u00a0 The fact that the distillery was a clandestine one is also evidence of the uninhabited nature of that district.\u00a0 The court should have imposed upon Maquiraya the maximum penalty.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court is therefore reversed as to Jose Acquebay and he is found by this court not guilty and his discharge is ordered forthwith.\u00a0 The judgment of the lower court is modified\u00a0 as to Vicente Maquiraya and he is hereby condemned to\u00a0 imprisonment in the Insular Penitentiary of the Philippine Islands for the term of seventeen years and four months of <i>cadena temporal<\/i>, to suffer the accessories prescribed by article 57 of the Penal Code and to pay the costs of the action.\u00a0 There being no proof of the damages sustained by Mr. Wright by reason of the injury complained of, no award of damages in his behalf is made but his right to maintain a civil action in respect thereto is hereby expressly reserved to him.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

No. 4859, August 18, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>MANUEL JIMENO ET AL., PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES, <i>VS.<\/i> LOPE GACILAGO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the 7th of June, 1905, Manuel Jimeno, Clara Jimeno, Emilio Jimeno, Filomena Jimeno and her husband, Salvador Trono, filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros, alleging:\u00a0 that by means of a public instrument which was attached\u00a0 to the complaint a contract for partition of property had been entered into between them and Lope Gacilago; that, according to the possessory information, the hacienda or land partitioned between both parties is situated in the pueblo of Binalbagan, Occidental Negros, and is bounded on the north and east by the lands of Bias Gerona and the Pangiplan River; on the south by the said river and the lands of Agapito Gayacao, Pedro Labayen and Bias Gerona; on the southeast by those of Placido Insay, Vicente Librado and Alvaro Gigantoca; on the west by those of Genoblasa, Hipolito Orendain and Inocentes Grecia; and on the northwest by those of Chino Jose Gonzalez; that the defendant, Gacilago, is in possession of all the property described in the instrument of partition, but, with the exception of two cocoanut groves described in clause 7 thereof, he refuses to deliver to the plaintiffs, as per agreement, the portion that pertains to them; that the defendant, Gacilago, refuses to comply with the terms of the said instrument, under the pretext that clause 2 thereof is slightly obscure, the obscurity being due to erroneous data furnished by the defendant himself, consisting in the inverted placing of the words north and south used in said clause, which should have been stated in the reverse order, as may be easily inferred from the text of the said instrument; and that, by reason of this act of the defendant, the plaintiffs have suffered loss and damages to the extent of P600, wherefore they prayed that judgment be entered against the defendant compelling him to comply with the terms of the attached instrument of partition, and that the plaintiffs be allowed damages, sentencing the defendant to pay the costs in addition.<br\/><br\/>After the demurrer presented by the defendant, Lope Gacilago, had been withdrawn, his counsel on the 28th of August, 1905, answered in writing to the complaint and denied each and every one of its allegations with the exception of those contained in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the same, which he admitted as true; and, as a defense, he alleged that the defendant had strictly complied with everything stipulated in the public instrument of partition to which the complaint referred, and for said reason he prayed the court to absolve him of the same and to sentence the plaintiffs to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>At the trial of the case evidence was adduced by both parties, and the documents exhibited by them were made of record; on the 2d of March, 1908, the lower court entered judgment, holding that clause 2 of the\u00a0 said contract should be understood as stated in the decision; that the word south should be used instead of the word north, and where north appears written the word south should be placed, and it sentenced the defendant to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P600 as rental for two years or the last crops of the portion of the property pertaining to them, and the costs of the proceedings.\u00a0 The defendant excepted to said judgment, and on the 3d of March moved for a new trial on the ground that the conclusions contained in the said judgment were manifestly\u00a0 and evidently contrary to the weight of the evidence; the motion was overruled on the 4th of April following, to which the defendant excepted and presented a bill of exceptions which was approved by the lower court on the 18th of the said month of April, 1908, and forwarded to this court together with the original documents and the evidence adduced by both parties.<br\/><br\/>The principal question involved in the appeal before us is merely of fact, that is, whether in the preparation of the second clause of the instrument of partition of certain undivided property, dated August 29, 1904, an error was committed in the designation of the portions divided up with relation to two of the cardinal points of the horizon, and to the true situation of the estate that is the subject of the division.<br\/><br\/>The fact was also alleged that the plaintiff had agreed to the proposition of the defendant whereby he was to be granted a small parcel of a capacity of 4 or 5 <i>cavanes<\/i> of seed in the central or intermediate part of the land that belonged to the plaintiffs on the west to serve as a means of communication between the two parcels, north and south, that went to him; but said fact was not admitted; on the contrary, it has been positively denied by the said plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>It appears stipulated in clause 2 of the said instrument that the hacienda <i>Filomena de Payao<\/i> should be divided into three parts between the plaintiffs and the defendant; the northern\u00a0 and southern part of the estate to go to, the defendant, Gacilago, and the central part of the same, lying between the said\u00a0 hacienda road and the old road to the pueblo of Soledad, both of which run parallel from east to west through the central part of the property, to go to the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>If the old road which runs from east to west to the pueblo of Soledad is found toward the north, in view of the situation of the land that forms said hacienda in its entirety with relation to the four cardinal points of the earth, and if the hacienda road is on the south as shown on the map, Exhibit A, which the defendant himself admitted to be a true and faithful one to the best of his knowledge and understanding, declaring that he had drawn it himself (folio 42), it is unquestionable that a material error was committed in the preparation of the aforesaid clause 2 of the instrument of partition, and in so considering it, the court below\u00a0 acted rightly and in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>As to the assignment of a parcel of 4 or 5 <i>cavanes<\/i> in extent in the central part adjudicated under the agreement to the plaintiffs, and denied by the latter, it does not appear duly proven, nor is it mentioned in the document executed before the notary wherein the parties agreed to the final division of the estate and other property which so far had not been divided.<br\/><br\/>Allegations not duly substantiated by the record can not prevail against the validity and efficiency of the stipulations contained in authentic documents, whether they be public or private, inasmuch as whatever may have been agreed to in a contract, where it does not violate the prohibitive provisions of the law or public morals, is binding upon the contracting parties, (Arts. 1254 and 1278, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>If the alleged assignment of a portion of the land that went to the plaintiffs for furnishing communication between the two separate portions adjudicated to the defendant had been stipulated between them, it would so appear in the instrument of partition, and when such a cession does not appear therein, it is because it was not the subject of an agreement between the contracting parties.<br\/><br\/>When the terms of a written contract are clear and leave no doubt, the literal sense of its stipulations should be observed, and there should not be understood as included therein things and cases different from those with regard to which the persons interested intended to contract.\u00a0 (Arts. 1281 and 1283, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing it is inferred that there was no just or lawful reason for failure to comply with the stipulations of the written contract in question; therefore, the party that failed to fulfill the agreement is responsible for the loss occasioned to the other party, and is obliged to indemnify him in accordance with the law and the principles of justice.<br\/><br\/>For the above considerations, and in view of the fact that the judgment appealed from is in accordance with the law and the merits of the case, it is our opinion that the same should be, and is hereby affirmed with the costs against the defendant appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

the husband named above was absent at the time, and the woman was alone\u00a0 in the house with her three children, the eldest of whom was 4 years old; she recognized the three accused as the men who entered her house, and one of them, Fausto Parales, as the one who cautioned her against speaking aloud.\u00a0 During the time which the thieves took to search the house, nearly two hours, the woman does not appear to have been illtreated by them, although they pointed their revolvers at her when demanding the delivery of the money and when the children cried; the woman could not say if the others who were in the yard near the house were armed or not.<br\/><br\/>Upon leaving the house of Vicenta Gervasio the malefactors also visited the adjoining house owned by Dominga Espiritu, who woke up at the moment when the door was broken open, and two of the thieves who were also armed with revolvers managed to get in; they ordered her to strike a light and to turn over to them the sum of P700 which they said had been deposited in her hands by her brother-in-law, Crispulo, the husband of Vicenta Gervasio, and as no such delivery had been made, nor had she any money to deliver, they searched the house and seized P3 in copper coins, one rosary and pair of earrings, shoes, and some other articles of the total value of P23.50.\u00a0 The offended woman recognized Fausto Parales as one of the two thieves.\u00a0 At the time her husband was absent and she also heard thieves in the house of her sister-in-law, Vicenta Gervasio.<br\/><br\/>In view\u00a0 of the above, a complaint was presented by the provincial\u00a0 fiscal in the Court of First Instance of Cavite charging Esteban Celestino, Fausto Parales, and Alejandro Lapena with the crime of <i>robo en cuadrilla<\/i>, and corresponding proceedings having been instituted, the trial judge in his decision of December, 22, 1908, sentenced the accused Parales and Lapena to the penalty of three years, eight months, and one day of <i>prisidio correccional<\/i>, to suffer the accessory penalties, each to pay one-third of the costs, and to return the stolen articles, or to jointly and severally indemnify the owners in the value thereof, and in case of insolvency to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment.\u00a0\u00a0 Esteban Celestino was acquitted with the remaining one-third of the costs <i>de oficio<\/i>.\u00a0 From said judgment the first two who were sentenced have appealed, and this decision shall only\u00a0 refer to\u00a0 them.<br\/><br\/>As shown by the facts above stated the case furnishes satisfactory proof of the reality and certainty of the crime of robbery executed by several individuals in the two adjoining houses of the brothers Crispulo and Marcelo Eusebio, situated in the barrio of Talaba, town of Bacoor, Cavite, the thieves having seized jewelry, clothing, and other effects of the total value of P41 in the first house, and cash, jewelry, and other articles valued at P23.50 in the second.\u00a0 The fact that the thieves, of whom there were more than three, were all armed has not been established, for which reason the deed only deserves to be classified as simple robbery, without the character of <i>cuadrilla<\/i>, and the same falls within the provisions of articles 502 and 503, No. 5, of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the denial of the accused appellants, Parales and Lapena, and their exculpatory allegations, the preponderance of the evidence and other merits of the case produce in the mind conviction, beyond all reasonable doubt, of the guilt of the said accused as the proven authors who, with others at present unknown, participated in the crime in question.<br\/><br\/>Fausto Parales was recognized by the owners of the two houses broken into as one of the malefactors who robbed them, while Alejandro Lapena was recognized by one only of said owners, Vicenta Gervasio, who had more presence of mind, and not by the other, Dominga Espiritu, who was probably badly frightened; but the second robbery having been committed in the house of the latter by the same thieves, one of whom was Lapena, who together with Parales first entered the house of Vicenta, it is to be presumed with good reason that he also took part in the second committed by the same gang.\u00a0 It should be noted that the complaint, the proceedings, and the judgment refer to only one crime of robbery.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of this crime the concurrence of the two aggravating circumstances 15 and 20 of article 10 of the Penal Code should be considered, for the reason that it was executed in an inhabited house and in the darkness and silence of night, without any mitigating circumstance to compensate their effects; therefore the proven authors of the same should be punished with the maximum degree of the penalty imposed for said crime.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and Fausto Parales and Alejandro Lapena should each be sentenced, as we do hereby sentence them, to the penalty of seven years of <i>presidio mayor<\/i>, to suffer the accessory penalties of article 57 of the code, to jointly and severally return to the injured parties the money, jewelry, and other articles stolen, or to indemnify them for the value thereof,\u00a0 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency under the provisions of article 51, and each of them to pay one-third of the\u00a0 costs of both instances;

Fifer made a contract in writing with the plaintiffs which stated that he on that day sold and transferred to the plaintiffs for the sum of P4,000 in cash, the furniture and appurtenances of three drinking saloons in the city of Manila, and other personal property therein described.\u00a0\u00a0 The contract contained the following conditions:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is further stipulated and agreed by and between the parties hereto that the said William H. Fifer shall remain in possession of the said, property hereinabove sold to the said Kuenzle &amp; Streiff, and the said William H. Fifer agrees with the said Kuenzle &amp; Streiff to repurchase the property hereinbefore mentioned and to pay therefor the sum of four thousand pesos (P4,000), payable in consecutive monthly installments of five hundred pesos (P5OO) each, beginning with the 1st day of November, 1905, together with the interest thereon at the rate of 10 per centum per annum; interest payable monthly.\u00a0 It being\u00a0 expressly understood by the said Fifer that the title to and the ownership of the said\u00a0 property shall remain in the said Kuenzle &amp; Streiff until the said four thousand pesos (P4,000) shall have been fully paid.<br\/><br\/>\"The said William H. Fifer agrees to keep the property known as the 'Luzon Cafe\"' insured during all the time of this contract in the sum of four thousand pesos, and to transfer the said insurance\u00a0 policy, premiums fully paid up, to the said Kuenzle &amp; Streiff, and further agrees to keep the said premises in a good condition.<br\/><br\/>\"Should the said William H. Fifer fail to pay any of the said monthly installments as hereinabove provided\u00a0 for, or the interest\u00a0 upon the principal, then the said Kuenzle &amp; Streiff shall have the right immediately upon such default to take possession without judicial process of all the property hereinbefore mentioned.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Fifer had formerly been the owner of the personal property mentioned in this contract.\u00a0 The P4,000 mentioned therein were actually paid on the day named by the plaintiffs to Fifer.\u00a0 He remained in possession of the property until the 2d day of January, 1906.\u00a0 On that day, he not having made the monthly payments provided for, the plaintiffs took possession of the property.\u00a0 They on that day appointed\u00a0 Fifer, by a written document, manager of the establishment.\u00a0 Every day thereafter an agent of the plaintiffs went to the \"Luzon Cafe\" and took charge of the cash which had been received.\u00a0 From that day the plaintiffs paid all the bills for goods bought by Fifer as their agent and collected all the debts due to the establishment.\u00a0 On the 27th of April, 1906, the defendants caused a preliminary attachment to be levied upon two billiard tables which were in the \"Luzon Cafe\" and which were included in the property described in the contract of the 11th of October, 1905.\u00a0 While the sheriff was making this attachment, an agent of the plaintiffs came to the place with the contract in question and claimed that the plaintiffs were in possession of the establishment.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this notice, the sheriff proceeded with the attachment.\u00a0 The public license granted for the sale of liquors in this place was at the time of the attachment in the name of Fifer, as was also the license for the maintenance of a billiard saloon.\u00a0 The plaintiffs, on the 1st day of May, 1906, brought this action to recover of the defendants and the sheriff the possession of the billiard tables.\u00a0 Judgment was rendered in the court below in favor of the plaintiffs and the defendants have appealed.<br\/><br\/>The defendants claim that the contract of October 11, 1905, is a contract of pledge and that the possession of the property pledged not having been taken by the pledgee, the pledge is void.\u00a0 The document itself, however, shows that it was not a pledge but a sale with the right to repurchase.\u00a0 In this respect the case differs from that of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Terrell (2 Phil. Rep., 222), where it appeared from the face of the document that the contract was one of pledge.<br\/><br\/>A contract such as this, for the sale of personal property on condition that the title should remain in the vendor until the purchase price has been paid is valid, although the possession of the property is at the time of making the contract delivered to the purchaser.\u00a0 (Judgment of the supreme court of Spain, 16th of February, 1894; Bachrach <i>vs<\/i>. Peterson, 7 Phil. Rep., 571.) In the particular that the property here involved once belonged to the debtor, was resold to the creditor, and then again sold to the debtor, the case is similar to Bierce <i>vs<\/i>. Hutchins (205 U. S., 340).<br\/><br\/>It seems to be claimed by the appellants that there was never any delivery of the property by Fifer to the plaintiffs, and consequently that the original sale of Fifer to the plaintiffs was never perfected.\u00a0 Whatever might be said of the case as it stood on the 11th day of October, 1905, upon this question of a delivery then made, it is apparent that that claim, as far as the parties to the transaction are concerned, can not be sustained in view of what took place on and after the 2d day of January, 1906.\u00a0 The parties then agreed that the possession should be transferred to the plaintiffs and it was thus transferred, Fifer becoming from that time the agent of the plaintiffs in the management of the business.\u00a0 After that time, as has been seen, the plaintiffs were the persons really in charge.\u00a0 They paid all the current obligations, took possession daily of all the cash received, and collected all the bills due.\u00a0 As between the parties, this was a sufficient compliance with the provisions of the law which require a delivery upon the sale of an article.\u00a0 In the case of The Fidelity and Deposit Company <i>vs<\/i>. Wilson (8 Phil. Rep., 51), there was no such evidence of delivery as appears in this case.<br\/><br\/>If the appellants could prove that the whole transaction between Fifer and the plaintiffs was fraudulent as to the creditors of Fifer, they might, by complying with the provisions of article 1290 and following articles of the Civil Code, relating to the rescission of contracts, perhaps, be entitled to some relief.\u00a0 But in the first place they have not proved that the contract was fraudulent as to the creditors of Fifer.\u00a0 The evidence establishes a bona fide sale by Fifer of the property in question and the actual payment by the plaintiffs to him of P4,000 in cash.<br\/><br\/>Nor have the appellants brought themselves within the other requirements of the articles above cited.\u00a0 There is no sufficient proof in the case to show that they are even creditors of Fifer.\u00a0 The mere fact that they commenced a suit against Fifer and procured a writ of attachment to be issued thereon is not\" evidence that Fifer owed them anything.\u00a0 Nor did they prove that, even on the theory that they were creditors of Fifer, they could not collect their debt in any other way.\u00a0 (Arts. 1290 [1291], par. 3, and 1294, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Even on the theory that the appellants were creditors of Fifer, it is settled by the decisions of this court that the attachment gave them no right to the property itself.\u00a0 (Fabian <i>vs<\/i>. Smith, Bell &amp; Co., 8 Phil. Rep., 496; Martinez <i>vs<\/i>. Holliday, Wise &amp; Co., 1 Phil.

that, several years prior to 1888, Getulio Belen, during his marriage with Juliana Fanoy, both residents of San Pablo, had two children named Marciana and Feliciano Belen, the said spouses having acquired a great portion of the property hereinafter described with money belonging to the conjugal partnership; that Getulio Belen had inherited only a small portion of the property from his father, which property consists of a tract of land planted with 600 cocoanut trees, situated in the barrio of Santa Maria Magdalena in the municipality of San Pablo, and is bounded on the north by land of Cornelio Belen; on the east and south, by land of Venancio Alimon, and on the north (west) by the lands of Venancio Alimon, Geronimo Sahagun, and Faustina Belen; another parcel of land also planted with 600 cocoanut trees, situated in the said barrio, is bounded on the north by the cocoanut groves of Lucas Baldovino and Alejo Belen, on the east by the latter's land, on the south by lands belonging to the said Alejo Belen and Maria Belen, and on the west by those belonging to Pedro and Francisco Pandifio; that on October 19 of that year, Getulio Belen died intestate, and on September 17, 1890, Juliana Fanoy contracted another marriage with Gerardo Belen, from which marriage the plaintiffs Honoria Belen and Martin Belen were born on November 20, 1890, and November 10, 1892 respectively; that on July 15,1895, Juliana Fanoy died intestate, leaving as her heirs her four children born from two marriages, Marciana, Feliciano, Honoria, and Martin, all of the surname Belen; that Marciana Belen died on August 23, 1900, as did Feliciano Belen on May 2, 1902, without any succession, their two half-brothers, the plaintiffs, surviving them, arid as the said Marciana and Feliciano died without any debt or obligation pending; leaving only the above-described lands, the plaintiffs did not petition for a letter of administration on the death of the latter, Feliciano Belen, but in 1902, in which year he died, the defendant Alejo Belen took possession of the two said lands without any title or right thereto, and since that time he has retained and refused to return or to deliver them to the plaintiffs in spite of the repeated demands made by the latter; furthermore, that he has failed to give them any portion of the fruits and profits of the said lands, the value of which has amounted to P4,000 from that year up to the date of the complaint, and has applied them to his own benefit; wherefore they prayed; that the court, after the corresponding proceedings and trial, declare the plaintiffs to be the exclusive owners of the said lands, and sentence the defendant to return the same and to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P4,000 and the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer filed by the defendant was overruled, and Gerardo Belen having been appointed guardian <i>ad litem<\/i> for the plaintiffs, the defendant in his answer denied each and all of the facts alleged in the complaint in each and every one of its paragraphs, and alleged as a special defense:\u00a0 That he was the owner of two parcels of land situated in the sitio of Santa Maria Magdalena, of the pueblo of San Pablo, La Laguna, and that he did not\u00a0 know whether they were the same as those described in the complaint; that in case they were the same as those claimed by the plaintiffs, then he alleged that said lands were his exclusive property, the first having been acquired by him by inheritance from his mother Valeria Alcantara, who in her turn had acquired it by\u00a0 purchase from Ramon Biglete in 1885, and the second by inheritance from his father Facundo Belen, as the share of the estate falling to him upon the division of the property of his father among his sons and legitimate descendants; and that the plaintiffs had no right of action to claim any right or interest over the above-mentioned lands, and therefore he asked the court to render judgment in his favor absolving him from the complaint with the coats against the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced by both parties, and the exhibits introduced at the trial having been made of record, the lower court, on March 10, 1908, entered judgment absolving the defendant from the complaint with the costs against the plaintiffs, whose counsel, upon being notified of the decision, duly excepted thereto and moved for a new trial on the ground that the judgment was contrary to the weight of the evidence and that the evidence did not support the judgment; his motion was\u00a0 overruled, the plaintiffs excepted and the corresponding bill of exceptions having been presented was duly approved and forwarded to this court.<br\/><br\/>By a well-settled rule of the courts, a person who brings an action to recover possession, like the one at bar, is under the obligation fully to prove, not only his ownership, but also the identity of the thing claimed.<br\/><br\/>As counsel for the plaintiffs has failed to comply with these requisites, they are not entitled to a final judgment in their favor, declaring them to be the exclusive owners of the two parcels of land claimed in the complaint, and against the defendant by sentencing him to return\u00a0 them said land together with its products or the value thereof.<br\/><br\/>They not only failed to prove that they were in possession of said\u00a0 parcels of land under title of ownership prior to 1902, but also the fact that they actually lost their possession in the unlikely and incredible manner they claim, in other words, that Gerardo Belen, upon the request of the defendants agreed to deliver to the latter the aforesaid parcels of land for the purpose of building thereon a <i>camarin<\/i> (warehouse) for the manufacture of oil, though later Alejo Belen, in spite of his repeated demands refused to return the said lands to him.\u00a0 This was a cession as peculiar as inexplicable, which prompts the inference that at least a part of the cocoanut trees was destroyed, without any benefit to the persons claiming to be the owners.<br\/><br\/>The mere possession of a thing is sufficient to insure respect\u00a0 to the possessor while no other person appears to show and prove better right, according to the doctrine of the courts.\u00a0 (Art. 440, Civil\u00a0 Code.)\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant has proved that he has been for many years in possession of the lands in question under title of ownership, and therefore, whether the proof of his right of ownership be or be not sufficient, so long as no other person appears with a better right, he is entitled thereto.\u00a0 Article 448 of the same code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The possessor by virtue of ownership has in his favor the legal presumption that he holds possession by reason of a sufficient title and he can not be forced to show it.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In case No. 3819, entitled Sanchez Mellado <i>vs<\/i>. The Municipality of Tacloban (9 Phil. Rep., 92), this court held that-<br\/><blockquote>\"In an action to recover possession of real estate under an alleged titled of ownership, the plaintiff must rely upon the strength of his own title and not upon the weakness of that of the defendant, and he must establish his allegations by a preponderance of evidence.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Counsel for the plaintiffs did not satisfactorily prove his allegations, so that the judge, after considering the evidence adduced by both parties, found that the preponderance of the same was in favor of the defendant, and this clearly appears from the case.<br\/><br\/>It is an old and well-settled rule of the courts that the burden of proving the action is upon the plaintiff, and that if he fails satisfactorily to show the facts upon which he bases his claim, the defendant is under no obligation to prove his exceptions.\u00a0 This rule is in harmony with the provisions of section 297 of the Code of Civil Procedure holding that each party must prove his own affirmative allegations, etc.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing considerations and accepting those contained in the judgment appealed from, with the rectification, however, that it shall be understood that the first parcel of land was sold by Roman Rigleto to Valeria Alcantara widow of Facundo Belen, instead of to Juliana Fanoy, which is a material error noted in the first paragraph at page 10 of the bill of exceptions, we are of opinion, and so hold, that said judgment should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

MAXIMO LICAUCO ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 15th day of December, 1904, a certificate of title to the parcel of land described in the complaint was issued in pursuance of a decree of the Court of Land Registration to one Rafael Herrera.\u00a0 Thereafter Maximo Licauco,\u00a0 one of the defendants in these proceedings, instituted an action against Herrera in the Court of First Instance of Manila, and obtained an order of attachment against the property of Herrera, which was levied on this land on the 1st day of October, 1907, by filing and registering a copy of the order in the office of the register of deeds.\u00a0 On the 10th of March, 1908, Licauco undertook to subject the property thus attached to execution on the judgment in his favor in the action wherein the order of attachment was issued; and together with his codefendant in these proceedings, Jose\" McMicking, ex officio sheriff of Manila, took the necessary steps looking to the sale at public auction of the above-mentioned parcel of land, for the purpose of recovering therefrom the amount of that judgment.\u00a0 Thereupon Lucio Buzon, the plaintiff in the case at bar, claiming to be the true owner of the land in question, instituted these proceedings for the purpose of enjoining Licauco and the sheriff of Manila from proceeding with the execution sale.<br\/><br\/>It appears that on the 6th day of September, 1907, Herrera executed a deed of sale of the land in question to Lucio Buzon, which, on the same day, was duly acknowledged before a notary public, but was not presented to the register of deeds until the 4th day of October, 1907, when Buzon secured from the office of the register of deeds of the city of Manila a certificate of transfer and title to the land in question, which certificate contains, in the memorandum of incumbrances affecting the property described therein, an annotation of the order of attachment filed\u00a0 and registered by Licauco in the office of the register of deeds, on the 1st day of October, 1907.<br\/><br\/>Licauco, the defendant in the case at bar, insisted that this alleged sale to Buzon was a simulated and not a genuine sale; that the right of ownership never passed by virtue thereof from Herrera, the original owner; that the certificate of title held by Buzon was obtained by fraud; and that, for this reason, as well as because of the fact that he had duly filed and recorded his order\u00a0 of attachment four days prior to the issuance of Buzon's certificate of transfer and title, this certificate should not be permitted to defeat his right to subject the property in question to execution.<br\/><br\/>The trial court held that Buzon was entitled to the injunction prayed for, and that Licauco's remedy for the alleged infringement of his rights resulting from the alleged fraudulent or simulated sale, was in the Court of Land Registration, because in the opinion of the trial judge, Buzon's certificate of title, issued on October 4, 1907, \"was duly issued by the register of deeds of Manila pursuant to a decree of the Court of Land Registration,\" and under section 38 of Act No. 496, such a decree \"shall bind the land and quiet title thereto,\" and be \"conclusive upon and against all persons * * *\" subject, however, \"to the right of any person deprived of land or of any estate or interest therein by decree of registration obtained by fraud to file in the Court of Land Registration a petition for review within one year after entry of the decree.\"\u00a0 It is very clear, that the trial court erred in thus\u00a0 relying upon the provisions of section 38 of Act No; 496, since Buzon's certificate of transfer and title shows on its face that it is not the original title to the land in question, issued by the register of deeds, <i>in pursuance of a decree of the Court of Land Registration<\/i>, having been issued by the register of deeds under the provisions of section 57 of Act No. 496, upon presentation to him of the deed of conveyance from Herrera, to whom the original certificate of title had been issued in pursuance of a decree of the Court of Land Registration on the 15th day of December, 1904.<br\/><br\/>Upon motion for a new trial, the court reexamined the merits of plaintiff's contention regardless of the point discussed in its original decision, and in overruling the motion arrived at \"the same\u00a0 result;\" holding that the evidence failed to establish defendant's allegations that the conveyance to plaintiff of the land in controversy was fraudulent as to the defendant Licauco, and that the deed of conveyance to Buzon, executed on September 6, 1907, \"though unrecorded takes priority over the subsequent attachment of execution against the same property, levied on October 1, 1907,\" notwithstanding the fact that the order of attachment was filed and recorded in the office of the\u00a0 register of deeds four days prior to the issuance of the certificate of title to Buzon, and the further fact that the levy of attachment was duly annotated in the \"memorandum of incumbrances\" affecting the property described therein, which appears on the back of the certificate.\u00a0 This ruling appears to be based upon the doctrine laid down by this court in various cases wherein we have held that the levy of an attachment or of an execution against a judgment debtor upon real estate which stands in his name in the old registries of property, created by virtue of the provisions of the Spanish Mortgage Law (<i>Ley Hipotecaria<\/i>), is void where it appears that prior to the levy of the attachment or execution, the property has been conveyed to a third party by an unrecorded deed; and that such levies of attachment or execution do not give the judgment creditor any preference over existing claims against the property that have not been recorded; the provisions contained in the statutes of many of the States of America, whereby an unrecorded deed is declared to be of no effect as to a subsequent recorded attachment or as to judgment creditors, not being found in the laws of the Philippine Islands applicable to transactions affecting lands not registered under the Land Registration Act; and the provisions of article 1473 of the Civil Code, which give preference to that one of two deeds which is first recorded, not extending to attachments or executions.\u00a0 (See Fabian <i>vs<\/i>. Smith, Bell &amp; Co., 8 Phil. Rep., 496; Boncan <i>vs<\/i>. Smith, Bell &amp; Co., 9 Phil. Rep., 109.)<br\/><br\/>But it is to be observed that in none of these cases had the property been registered under the provisions of Act No. 496, known as \"The Land Registration Act,\" nor were the levies of attachment made, as in this case, under the provisions of that Act touching \"attachments\u00a0 and other liens.\"\u00a0 And while an unrecorded deed of conveyance executed by the owner of land not registered under the provisions of the Land Registration Act conveys the title and ownership to the purchaser as of the date of its execution, so that a subsequent levy of an attachment or execution by a judgment creditor of the vendor is void and of no effect, the same rule can not be applied where the land has been registered under that Act, because, by its terms, an unrecorded deed of conveyance does not convey or affect the land until and unless the transaction is duly registered.<br\/><br\/>Section 50 of that Act expressly provides that-<br\/><blockquote>\"No deed, mortgage, lease, or other voluntary instrument, except a will, purporting to convey or affect registered land, shall take effect as a conveyance or bind the land, but shall operate only as a contract between the parties, and as evidence of authority to the\u00a0 clerk or register of deeds to make registration\"- the act of registration being \"the operative act to convey and affect the land.\"\u00a0 Section 51 provides that-<br\/><br\/>\"Every conveyance, mortgage, lease, lien, attachment, order, decree, instrument or entry, affecting registered land, which would, under existing laws, if recorded, filed, or entered in the office of the register of deeds, affect the real estate to which it relates, shall, if registered, filed, or entered in the office of the register of deeds in the province or city where the real estate to which such instrument relates lies, be notice to all persons from the time of such registering, filing, or entering.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>And section 59 provides that-<br\/><blockquote>\"If at the time of any transfer there appear upon the registration book\u00a0 incumbrances or claims adverse to the title of the registered one, they shall be stated in the new certificate or certificates, except so far as they may be simultaneously released or discharged.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Under these express provisions of the Land Registration Act, it is clear that the deed of sale of Herrera to Buzon did not take effect as a conveyance, or bind the land, until the 4th day of October, 1907, and that the levy of Licauco's attachment against the land by the filing and recording of the order of attachment in the office of the register of deeds on the 1st day of October was not affected thereby.<br\/><br\/>Buzon, on the back of whose certificate of transfer and title appears a memorandum of the levy of attachment, had both actual and constructive notice of the fact that the attachment had been levied upon the land purchased by him, before he became the owner, and clearly he is not entitled to an injunction to restrain Licauco from subjecting this land to execution, in accordance with the provisions of the Land Registration Act touching \"attachments and other liens.\"<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the injunction granted therein is dissolved, with the costs in the Court of First Instance in favor of the defendants, but without costs to either party in this instance.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Arellano, C.

In that the court below permitted the defendant to offer evidence\u00a0 with respect to having rendered accounts prior to the order entered in cause No. 478.<br\/><br\/>2. In having admitted as evidence in the present case the documents Exhibits Nos. 4, 6, 11, and 12 of the appellee.<br\/><br\/>3.

In not having ruled\u00a0 on the defense of prescription interposed by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the first assignment, the order of court issued in case No. 478 is the one of November 13, 1906, mentioned in the statement of facts, and which finally closed the proceedings instituted by the plaintiff in January, 1905, to compel the defendant to render an accounting of the property of his ward in conformity with the provisions of section 709 of the Code of Civil Procedure, after the plaintiff had obtained the information necessary to exercise such actions as might lie in the premises, this being the sole object of said proceedings according to said section of the Code of Civil Procedure, which finally provides:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"*\u00a0 *\u00a0 * and such interrogatories and answers shall be in writing and signed by the party examined, and filed in the clerk's office.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>We have not to do with a final judgment holding that at no time was any accounting rendered; neither is it a question of going counter to the holdings in another action in allowing in the present case proof of the defense of the plaintiff against the action arising out of a guardianship which expired in 1898.<br\/><br\/>The documents numbered 4, 6, 11, and 12, referred\u00a0 to in the second assignment of error, were produced by the defendant, and in the opinion of the court below proved that the said defendant had rendered a general final accounting previous to the time of the tendering and acceptance of his resignation in 1898, and he was thereupon released from all responsibility arising from his administration.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the admission of the above-mentioneddocuments, the appellant, in discussing his assignment of error, alleges that paragraph 7 of section 383 of the Code of Civil Procedure has thereby been violated.\u00a0 His allegation lacks foundation, however, as paragraph 7 of the said section is not applicable to the case; it reads as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Parties or assignors of parties to an action or proceeding, or persons in whose behalf an action or proceeding is prosecuted, against an executor or administrator or other representative of a deceased person, or against a person of unsound mind, upon a claim or demand against the estate of such deceased person or against such\u00a0 person of unsound mind, can not testify as to any matter of fact occurring before the death of such deceased person or before such person became of unsound mind.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>It was agreed between the parties at the trial that the record of the proceedings of the family council \"constituted for the minor Francisca Pe\u00f1a, which ought to be in the possession of the new guardian appointed in consequence of the defendant's resignation, could not be found.\u00a0 When the defendant produced in court the above-mentioned documents, three of which were copies of said proceedings, he testified that they were authentic copies of the originals.<br\/><br\/>As to the third assignment of error, the conclusions of the lower court appear to be in accordance with the law and the evidence considered in the judgment.\u00a0 The evidence in question is a copy of the record of the meeting held by the family council of the minor Pe\u00f1a on September 21, 1898, which is as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The <i>protutor<\/i> said that he had examined, as appears hereunder, the accounts relating to the entire administration, by the guardian, of the estate of the late Don Pedro Pe\u00f1a, father of the said Do\u00f1a Francisca Pe\u00f1a Fernandez, and finds the same to be just and proper, and consequently, in accordance with the request of the guardian, is of the opinion that they should be approved.\u00a0 After careful examination and full discussion, the members of the council agree thereto, and there being no remarks to offer, and complying with the provisions of article 282 of the Civil Code, they unanimously agree to approve (<i>censurar favorablemente<\/i>) the accounts of the guardianship\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The said Ortiz is hereby granted\u00a0 the necessary authority to make formal delivery to the newly appointed <i>tutor<\/i> Don Jose Pe\u00f1a and <i>protutor<\/i> Don Emilio Puentevella\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 who examined the items of expenditure in said account\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 to the new members or any of the interested persons (the council), grants power to exact from the former guardian, Don Francisco Alvarez, upon his return from political exile, or from whomsoever it devolves upon to render an accounting for his administration\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 as well as from Don Estanislao Alarcon, the receiver of the inventoried property situated in Caramoan\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 and our solicitor, Don Francisco Borras or Don Ramon Ortiz, resigned, shall continue to maintain the rights of this council, the expenses to be defrayed by the funds of the guardianship or of the property left by the deceased Don Pedro Pe\u00f1a;\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 let a copy of the above-cited proceedings and of the present one be issued to the said Don Ramon Ortiz to be forwarded to the\u00a0 Court of First Instance through the justice of the peace inclosing a copy of the accounts\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 and let the bond given by the said Ortiz be canceled.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>This was subscribed by the president and members of the council, and the <i>tutor<\/i> and the <i>protutor<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The family council has the exclusive right to pass upon <i>(censurar<\/i>) all kinds of accounts which it is the duty of the guardian to render, whether annual, general, or final; the latter arising either from the termination of the guardianship, or by reason of the death, relief, removal, or resignation of the guardian.\u00a0 (Civil Code, arts. 279, 280, and 282.)<br\/><br\/><i>Censurar<\/i> accounts means, as Manresa observes, to approve or to reject accounts; the <i>Diccionario de la Lengua<\/i> defines it as \"to form an opinion of some work or writing,\" not merely in the sense of \"correcting, reproving, or remarking unfavorably on a thing\" (2 Manresa, Civ. Code, 340).\u00a0 This interpretation agrees with the law itself, under which the family council, in passing upon accounts, renders a decision or resolution with respect to and approves or rejects them.\u00a0 Treating of annual accounts, article 279 of the code provides \"that these accounts shall be examined by the <i>protutor<\/i> and audited b,y the council,\" and \"if the guardian does not agree to the <i>decision<\/i> of the council, he may apply to the courts * * *,\" by which it is seen that <i>censurar<\/i> means to resolve (<i>resolver<\/i>), to determine, or decide.<br\/><br\/>From what has been cited of the record of the proceedings of September 21, 1898, it appears:\u00a0 First,\" that upon the resignation of the guardian, Ramon Ortiz, he was relieved by Jose Pe\u00f1a; second, that said new guardian and the <i>protutor<\/i> Emilio Puentebella passed upon the items of expenditure shown in the general account rendered by Ramon Ortiz upon resigning office; and, third, that said general account was reviewed and expressly approved by the family council.<br\/><br\/>Following the provisions of article 279, article 280 says:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The guardian, who may be replaced by another, shall, as well as his heirs, be obliged to render a general account of his guardianship to the one taking his place, which shall be examined and audited in the manner prescribed in the preceding article.\u00a0 The new guardian shall be liable to theminor for any losses and damages, should he not demand and examine the accounts of his predecessor.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>This action was instituted for the losses and damages that the plaintiff considers were caused to his first wife, the minor Francisca Pe\u00f1a, by reason of the fact that the defendant, her guardian, had not made the general accounting which it was his duty to render of his administration.\u00a0 By law, the party against whom such action should be brought is Jose Pe\u00f1a, the person who succeeded\u00a0 Ramon Ortiz, as such guardian.\u00a0 The new guardian is, under the law liable to the minor for losses and damages for not having demanded and received an accounting from his predecessor.<br\/><br\/>As a matter of fact, however, he did examine the accounts, as shown by the proceedings of the family council.\u00a0 There was no necessity for him either to demand or to receive an accounting from his predecessor, as would have been necessary in case of a removal from office, or from the heirs, as would\u00a0 have been required in the event\u00a0 of the death of such predecessor.\u00a0 The latter resigned his guardianship in July, 1898, as appears by document No. 11, which, together with document No. 12, was accepted withoivt objection by the appellant, and on September 21 of the same year, upon\u00a0 again presenting his resignation, he submitted his\u00a0 accounts, which had already been examined by the <i>protutor<\/i>, who was the person who proposed to the family council that the accounts be approved.<br\/><br\/>The court below therefore rightly concluded that the general accounts of guardian Ramon Ortiz had been approved by the family council, and that once so approved the defendant was relieved from all liability in connection with the property of the said minor.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore he was relieved of all responsibility, because any that might have arisen since the 21st of September, 1898, reposed upon the new guardian, Jose Pe\u00f1a, the only person who since that time was\u00a0 responsible to the minor Francisca Pe\u00f1a for any losses and damages; he, being the person whose duty it was to demand them from his predecessor, either did not know how or did not wish to comply with his duty.\u00a0 He in turn was obliged to render a general; accounting of his guardianship to the minor upon her becoming of age, and was then the only person who should account for everything pertaining to the guardianship.<br\/><br\/>The last two assignments of error are not in accordance with the law, inasmuch as the motion for a new trial was rightly overruled, and because, no ruling having been made in the judgment relative to the\u00a0 defense of prescription, only the defendant had the right to allege such error in this instance.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<\/div>",

The defendant excepted to said decision and moved in writing for a new trial on the ground that the evidence did not justify the judgment; the motion was overruled, to which exception was taken by the defendant, who subsequently presented the corresponding bill of exceptions, which was approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>In the first paragraph of her brief the defendant appelant begins by stating that because the evidence adduced in the present case has not been submitted to this court, it can not be reviewed on appeal.   From the wording of the order of March 30, 1908, it appears that the documentary evidence was forwarded together with the bill of exceptions, but the testimony of the  witness was not submitted for the reasons stated in said order admitted by both parties.<br\/><br\/>This court, in view of the objection of the appellant, and also of the fact  that none of the contending parties raised the question of procedure  as to whether or not the judgment appealed from may be reviewed, bearing only in mind the result of the documentary evidence because the testimony of witnesses was not submitted, has simply examined the question with respect to whether or not the said judgment is in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the Court of First Instance is impugned as erroneous  because it does not conform to the provisions of sections 29 and 133  of the Code of Civil Procedure following:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"A lawyer shall be entitled to have and recover from his client no more than a reasonable compensation for the services rendered, with a view to the importance of the subject-matter of the controversy, to the extent of the services rendered, and the professional standing of the lawyer.  But in such cases the court shall not be bound by the opinion of lawyers as expert witnesses as to the proper compensation, but may disregard such testimony and base its conclusion on its own professional knowledge.  A written contract for services shall control the amount of recovery if found by the court not to be unconscionable or unreasonable.<br\/><br\/>\"Upon the trial of a question of fact, the decision of the court must be given in writing and filed with the clerk; but the statement of facts must contain only those facts which are essential to a clear understanding of the issues presented and of the facts involved.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The judgment states that the court does not consider that the sum of P1,398 is excessive for the professional services rendered by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge considered that the amount claimed is therefore a just compensation for the services rendered to the defendant, and that the same is not unconscionable or unreasonable; and consequently the decision ordering its payment is a just one and in  accordance with the provisions of the preinserted section 29 of Act No. 190, because whatever is reasonable and just can not be excessive; and if there is really an excess, this fact does not appear in the amount claimed, upon which reason, in accordance with law, the judgment undoubtedly rests.<br\/><br\/>As to the other error assigned, it must be taken into account that the court admitted the affirmation of the plaintiff relative to the fact that he rendered professional services as a lawyer to the defendant in the matter of the testate estate of the late Juan Pascual, and against this ruling, based on the result of the evidence adduced at the trial, no other conclusion  may be alleged with any legal foundation, inasmuch as the said judgment is not susceptible of being reviewed, as the appellant herself has claimed.<br\/><br\/>The facts which the court below considered proven, that the plaintiff had been employed by the defendant in the matter of the said testate estate, and that the former had rendered to the latter his services as a lawyer, are in our opinion sufficient to support the legality and justice of the judgment appealed from, since the amount claimed is not excessive, but is a just and reasonable compensation for the said professional services, and therefore the said judgment is likewise in accordance with the provision of section 133 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellant, and it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

S.<i> vs.<\/i> Matanug, 11 Phil. Rep., 188; Viada, vol.\u00a0 1, p. 202.)<br\/><br\/>In the second assignment of error above noted the appellant attempts to justify his acts by asserting that he had been attacked by the deceased, and that in inflicting the blows upon the deceased he had no intention of committing so grave an injury as that actually inflicted.\u00a0 In our opinion the lower court committed no error in not applying paragraph 3 of article 9 of the Penal Code. The evidence shows, beyond peradventure of doubt, that the defendant had lain in hiding, waiting for the arrival of the deceased, with a heavy club in his hand for the purpose of inflicting the blows which he actually did inflict.\u00a0 He must have intended, by reason of the means which he employed, to have committed the act which he actually did commit.<br\/><br\/>In discussing this same question, the supreme court of Spain, in a decision of the 29th of January, 1876, said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"If the accused struck a man such a heavy blow upon the head with a\u00a0 club that the man fell down with such an injury\u00a0 that it resulted in congestion of the brain from which he died in a few days, would he be able to allege in his favor the mitigating circumstance of not having intended to commit so grave an injury as that inflicted?\u00a0 The supreme court decided the question in the negative, basing its conclusion upon the theory that heavy blows upon the head, whether given with a club or other hard instrument, almost always cause death sooner or later, as shown by experience; the accused could have struck the blow with less force than he did and upon any other part of the body of the victim, instead of which he committed the deed in a very different manner by employing adequate means to cause death, therefore it is not reasonable to suppose that he had a purpose other than that which tended to produce the natural consequences of his acts, or that he had no intention of committing so grave an injury as that which he inflicted.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>Finding then as we do that the crime was committed with alevosia, which was sufficient to qualify the crime as that of assassination, and\u00a0 there being no extenuating or aggravating circumstances, the penalty to be imposed must be in the medium degree of that provided for the crime of assassination, or <i>cadena perpetua<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The lower court committed no error in imposing the penalty which he\u00a0 did impose.\u00a0 The sentence of the lower court is therefore hereby affirmed with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Rep., 175.<br\/><br\/>As some discussion has arisen as to the scope of that decision, it appears opportune to reaffirm the principle there laid down.\u00a0 The issue was, whether lands used as a fishery, for the growth of nipa, and as salt deposits, inland some distance from the sea, and asserted, though not clearly proved to be overflowed at high tide, could be registered as private property on the strength of ten years' occupation, under paragraph 6 of section 54 of Act No. 926 of the Philippine Commission.\u00a0 The point decided was that such land within the meaning of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, was agricultural, the reasoning leading up to that conclusion being that Congress having divided all the public lands of the Islands into three classes it must be included in one of the three, and being clearly neither forest nor mineral, it must of necessity fall into the division of agricultural land.\u00a0 In the concurring opinion, in order to avoid misapprehension on the part of those not familiar with United States land legislation and a misunderstanding of the reach of the doctrine, it was pointed out that under the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States the phrase \"public lands\" is held to be equivalent to \"public domain,\" and does not by any means include all lands of Government ownership, but only so much of said lands as are thrown open to private appropriation and settlement by homestead and other like general laws.\u00a0 Accordingly, \"government land\" and \"public land\" are not synonymous terms; the first includes not only the second, but also other lands of the Government already reserved or devoted to public use er subject to private right.\u00a0 In other words, the Government owns real estate which is part of the \"public lands\" and other real estate which is not a part thereof.<br\/><br\/>This meaning attached to the phrase \"public lands\" by Congress in its land legislation is settled by usage and adjudication beyond a doubt, and without variation.\u00a0 It is therefore doing the utmost violence to all rules of construction to contend that in this law, dealing with the same subject-matter in connection with these Islands, a different meaning had, without indication or motive, been imported into the words.\u00a0 They can not have one meaning in every other statute and a different and conflicting meaning in this statute. Where property in general is referred to therein, other and apt phrases are used in order to include it; for instance, section 12 provides \"that <i>all the property and rights<\/i> which may have been acquired in the Philippine Islands by the United States * * * are hereby placed under the control of the Government of the said Islands.\"\u00a0 Therefore, there is much real property belonging to the Government which is not affected by statutes for the settlement, prescription or sale of public lands.\u00a0 Examples in point are properties occupied by public buildings or devoted to municipal or other governmental uses.<br\/><br\/>Among the authorities cited in the Mapa case are two, Shively <i>vs<\/i>. Bowlby (152 U. S., 1), and Mann <i>vs<\/i>. Tacoma Land Co. (153 U. S., .273), in which it was\/field that general public land laws did not apply to land over which, the tide ebbs and flows.\u00a0 Mr. Justice Gray, in Shively <i>vs<\/i>. Bowlby, which is in itself an epitome of the American Law of Waters, speaking of tide lands, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"But Congress has never undertaken by general laws to dispose of such lands.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"The Congress of the United States, in disposing of the public lands, has constantly acted upon the theory that those lands, whether in the interior, or on the coast, above high-water mark, may be taken up by actual occupant in order to encourage the settlement of the country, but that the navigable waters and the soils under them, whether within or above the ebb and flow of the tide, shall be and remain public highways; and, being chiefly valuable for the public purposes of commerce, navigation, and fishery, and for the improvements necessary to secure and promote those purposes, shall not be granted away during the period of territorial government.\"\u00a0 (Pp. 48 and 49.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The conclusions of the court are in part stated as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Lands under tide waters are incapable of cultivation or improvement in the manner of lands above high-water mark.\u00a0 They are of great value to the public for the purposes of commerce, navigation, and fishery.\u00a0 Their improvement by individuals, when permitted, is incidental or subordinate to the public use and right.\u00a0 Therefore the title and the control of them are vested in the sovereign for the benefit of the whole people\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.<br\/><br\/>\"Upon the acquisition of a territory by the United States, whether by cession from one of the States, or by treaty with a foreign country, or by discovery and settlement, the same title and dominion passed to the United States, for the benefit of the whole people, and in trust for the several States to be ultimately created out of the territory *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"The United States, while they hold the country as a territory, having all the powers both of national and municipal government, may grant, for appropriate purposes, titles or rights in the soil below high-water mark of tide waters.\u00a0 But they have never done so by general laws.\"\u00a0 (Pp. 57 and 58.)<br\/><\/blockquote>In Mann <i>vs<\/i>. Tacoma Land Co., it was said by Mr; Justice Brewer (p. 284) :<br\/><blockquote>\"It is settled that the general legislation of Congress in respect to public lands does not extend to tide lands *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 It provided that the scrip might be located on the unoccupied and unappropriated public lands, but the term 'public lands' does not include tide lands.\u00a0\u00a0 As said in Newhall <i>vs<\/i>. Sanger (92 U.\u00a0 S., 761, 763.)\u00a0 \"The words \"public lands\" are habitually used in our legislation to describe such as are subject to sale or other disposal under general laws.'\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In Illinois Central R. R. Company <i>vs<\/i>. Illinois (146 U. S., 387) Mr. Justice Field, delivering the opinion of the court, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"That the State holds the title to the lands under the navigable waters of Lake Michigan within its limits, in the same manner that the State hold title to soils under tide water, by the common law, we have already shown, and that title necessarily carries with it control over the waters above them whenever the lands are subjected to use.\u00a0 But it is a title different in character from that which the State holds in lands intended for sale.\u00a0 It is different from the title which the United States hold in the public lands which are open to preemption and sale.\u00a0 It is a title held in trust for the people of the State that they may enjoy the navigation of the waters, carry on commerce over them, and have liberty of fishing therein freed from the obstruction or interference of private parties.\u00a0 The interest of the people in the navigation of the waters and in commerce over them may be improved in many instances by the erection of wharves, docks, and piers therein, for which purpose the State may grant parcels of the submerged lands; and, so long as their disposition is made for such purposes, no valid objections can be made to the grants * * *\u00a0\u00a0 The control of the State for the purposes of the trust can never be lost, except as to such parcels as are used in promoting the interests of the public therein, or can be disposed of without any substantial impairment of the public interest in the lands and waters remaining * * *\u00a0 The State can no more abdicate its trust over property in which the whole people are interested, like navigable waters and soils under them, so as to leave them entirely under the use and control of private parties, except in the instance of parcels mentioned for the improvement of the navigation and use of the waters, or when parcels can be disposed of without impairment of the public interest in what remains, than it can abdicate its police powers in the administration of government and the preservation of the peace * * *\u00a0 So with trusts connected with public property, or property of a special character, like lands under navigable waters, they can not be placed entirely beyond the direction and control of the State.<br\/><br\/>\"The ownership of the navigable waters of the harbor and of the lands under them is a subject of public concern to the whole people of the State.\u00a0 The trust with which they are held, therefore, is governmental and can not be alienated, except in those instances mentioned of parcels used in the improvement of the interest thus held, or when parcels can be disposed of without detriment to the public interest in the lands and waters remaining. * * * \"\u00a0 (Pp. 452-455.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Mr. Justice Field quotes from an opinion by Mr. Justice Bradley, delivered in a case in the Circuit Court, speaking of lands under water, as follows (p. 457):<br\/><blockquote>\"Being subject to this trust, they were <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">publici juris;<\/span> in other words, they were held for the use of the people at large.\u00a0 It is true that to utilize the fisheries, especially those of shellfish, it was necessary to parcel them out to particular operators, and employ the rent or consideration for the benefit of the whole people; but this did not alter the character of the title.\u00a0 The land remained subject to all other public uses as before, especially to those of navigation and commerce, which are always paramount to those of public fisheries.\u00a0 It is also true that portions of the submerged shoals and flats, which really interfered with navigation, and could better subserve the purposes of commerce by being filled up and reclaimed, were disposed of to individuals for that purpose.\u00a0 But neither did these dispositions of useless parts affect the character of the title to the remainder.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>These citations are thus given at length in order to make clear, first that lands under the ebb and flow of the tide of navigable waters are not in America understood to be included in the phrase \"public lands\" in Acts of Congress of the United States; nor, perforce, can they be so understood in laws of the Philippine Commission drawn immediately under the sanction of those Acts; and, second, that such lands are not under existing Congressional legislation the subject of private ownership, any occupation thereof being subordinate to the public purposes of navigation and fishery.\u00a0 While as well in the original thirteen States in which there was never a national public domain to which the land laws of Congress could apply as in States more recently created out of that domain and which upon their formation became masters of their own land policy, the local laws govern riparian and littoral rights, subject only to Congressional control in matters of foreign and interstate commerce (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Mission Rock Co., 189 U. S., 391), yet, as to the unappropriated public lands constituting the public domain the sole power of legislation is vested in Congress, which has uniformly and consistently declined to assume the function of authorizing or regulating private appropriation of such rights.\u00a0 Therefore, in the absence of specific Congressional legislation, it is impossible for individuals to acquire title under the ten years' provision of Act No. 926 or even through a definite grant from the local legislature of land beneath navigable waters in which the tide ebbs and flows, except for wharfage or other purposes auxiliary to navigation or other public uses, unless in conformity with the preexisting local law of the Archipelago.<br\/><br\/>The matter is dwelt upon for the reason that the late Attorney-General in his very able brief calls attention to the effect apprehended from the extension of the words \"agricultural lands\" as used in Act No. 926 to include all public lands not forest or mineral in character, specifying two Acts of the Philippine Commission, the validity of which he fears might thereby be called into question.\u00a0 The first of these, Act No. 1039 dedicates to the use of the Navy Department of the United States Government certain ground and buildings in Cavite, while the other, Act No. 1654 is a fore-shore law regulating the control and disposal of filled Government lands.\u00a0 If the term \"agricultural lands\" be held to include all government property not forest or mineral in character, he suggests that these Acts, not being in conformity with the procedure of Act No. 926, as approved by Congress, would be invalid, and moreover, that the Philippine Government would be seriously tied up in the management and disposition of other lands owned by it.<br\/><br\/>Without finally passing on this question in relation to lands the owners of which are not before us as parties to this action, it is appropriate, in answering the argument of the law officer of the State, to point out that this consequence appears to be avoided by the restricted sense given to the words \"public land\" or \"public domain\" in the Act of Congress and in Act No. 926 as hereinbefore noted.\u00a0 Neither the property affected by Act No. 1039, already in use by the Navy Department of the United States, nor the fore-shore land mentioned in Act No. 1654, which is under the ebb and flow of the tide, was, in so far as appears in the Acts before us, part of the public domain to be disposed of under sections 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, and for that reason it is not included in any of the three subdivisions of \"public lands\" as agricultural or otherwise, although it was part of the property acquired in the Philippine Islands by the United States by the treaty of peace with Spain, which by section 12 of that Act was \"placed under the control of the Government of said Islands, to be administered for the benefit of the inhabitants thereof.\"\u00a0 It would seem that the validity of the Cavite Act can not be successfully assailed on this ground, while it may well be that The Fore-shore Act on examination will be found to fall, as to its general purpose, within the authorization of section ll of the Act of Congress, whereby the duty is imposed upon the Island Government of improving the harbors and navigable waters in the interest of commerce.<br\/><br\/>As a consequence, it follows that The Public Land Act did not apply to the fisheries in the Mapa case, if they are to be regarded as constituting, in a general sense, land under tidal waters.\u00a0 It becomes necessary, therefore, to refer to the character of the lands.<br\/><br\/>Although argued at different times, five of these cases have been\u00a0 presented substantially together, all being covered by one brief of the late Attorney-General in behalf of the Government in which, with many interesting historical and graphic citations he describes that part of the marginal seashore of the Philippine Islands known as <i>manglares<\/i>, with their characteristic vegetation.\u00a0 In brief, it may be said that they are mud flats, alternately washed and exposed by the tide, in which grow various kindred t plants which will not live except when watered by the sea, extending their roots deep into the mud and casting their seeds, which also germinate there.\u00a0 These constitute the mangrove flats of the tropics, which exist naturally, but which are also, to some extent, cultivated by man for the sake of the combustible wood of the mangrove and like trees as well as for the useful nipa palm propagated 'thereon.\u00a0 Although these flats are literally tidal lands, yet we are of the opinion that they can not be so regarded in the sense in which that term is used in the cases cited or in general American jurisprudence.\u00a0 The waters flowing over them are not available for purpose of navigation, and they \"may be disposed of without impairment of the public interest in what remains.\"\u00a0 Mr. Justice Bradley, in the passage quoted by Mr. Justice Field, makes an exception of submerged shoals and flats.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Railroad Company <i>vs<\/i>. Schurmeir (74 U. S., 272), a Government patent of public land bordering upon a river was held to include a parcel submerged at very high water and separated from the mainland by a slough in which the water ran when ordinarily high.\u00a0 In Mobile <i>vs<\/i>. Hallett (41 U. S., 260), at page 266, Mr. Justice Catron remarked in his dissenting opinion:<br\/><blockquote>\"* * * and that a mud flat, flowed by tide water, is the subject of grant by the Government to an individual, I think can not well be doubted by anyone acquainted with the southern country; when such valuable portions of it are mud flats, in the constant course of reclamation.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In several of the older States along the Atlantic coast such flats, either by force of ordinance, custom, judicial construction, or local laws are held to pass under private grants as appurtenant to the uplands.\u00a0 (Winslow <i>vs<\/i>. Patten, 34 Maine, 25; Litchfield <i>vs<\/i>. Scituate, 135 Mass., 39; People <i>vs<\/i>. New York and Staten Island Ferry Co., 68 N. Y., 71; Stevens <i>vs<\/i>. P. &amp; N. Railroad, 5 Vroom, 34 N. J. Law, 532.)\u00a0 There is even stronger reason for excepting mud flats from the rule of tide lands in these Islands, owing to the peculiarities of their configuration and to the nature of the tropical growth thereon, and whatever may be the action of the tide, we do not think that in the Philippines such of the shoals covered by this vegetation, whether spontaneously or by cultivation, as are not available for free navigation, or required for any other purpose of general benefit, can be considered tidal land reserved for public use alone, under the governmental trust for commerce and public fishery, but, on the contrary, we regard them as public property, susceptible of a sort of cultivation and of improvement, and as such, subject to occupation under paragraph 6 of section 54 of the Land Law.\u00a0 Instances may hereafter arise of fisheries unduly established in what are clearly navigable waters which would constitute a nuisance, and not be the subject of prescription or of grant.\u00a0 A brief reference to the five cases under consideration in this court, however, will serve to show that they all fairly fall within the benefits of the law.\u00a0 In the Mapa case<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> the property was far from the sea, partly occupied as a fish pond, as nipa land, and as a salt pit.\u00a0 It does not appear whether it was connected with the sea by nature or by art, or whether the tide ebbed or flowed upon it, or whether the salt was sufficient to impart to any portion of it a mineral character.\u00a0 In the Santiago case<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[2]<\/sup> there was a fishery about two thousand yards from the sea, with which it communicated by a river, and a portion of the inclosure was dedicated to growing the aquatic tree called <i>bacawan<\/i>.\u00a0 The fishery had been constructed by man, upon land heretofore sown with this tree.\u00a0 In the Gutierrez case<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">(1)<\/sup> it was shown that the land was partly highland, growing fruit trees, and partly lowland, converted by the occupant of the upland into a fishery by his labor.\u00a0 In the Baello case,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">(2)<\/sup> the river running to the sea was a hundred meters away, the salt water therefrom reaching the lowland by means of an artificial canal cut by the owner of the land when he gave up cultivating <i>bacawan<\/i>, thereon, and made it into a fishery.\u00a0 In the Montano case, although there was a considerable depth of water over the soil, yet before the fishery was made, some thirty years before the trial, <i>bacawan<\/i> had been sown and propagated in the mud by the owner who finally sold the entire cut when he built the dikes.<br\/><br\/>All these lots, in their original state, whether near the sea or at a distance from it inland, and whether bare or washed by the tides, were not covered by waters practically navigable and were filled, whether naturally or artificially, with vegetation sometimes cultivated and in common use for fuel and for building purposes, and they were all adapted to fisheries or fish hatcheries by the labor of man introducing or regulating the access of salt water thereto.\u00a0 It is obvious that all five cases are of the same general nature and that one rule must be applied to them all.<br\/><br\/>In this discussion of the meaning which the Congress of the United States attached to the phrase \"public lands\" in the Philippine Bill, we have assumed that it was used in the same sense as in other laws enacted by that body.\u00a0 If, however, it can be considered as employed with reference to the peculiar conditions of the territory to which it was to be applied and to the local law or usage prevailing therein, the result would not be different.\u00a0 In many of its general features the Spanish law of public lands in the Philippines resembled the American Government property was of two kinds-first, that of public use or service, said to be of public ownership, and second, that having a private character or use.\u00a0 (Civil Code, arts. 339 and 340.)\u00a0 Lands of the first class, while they retain their public character are inalienable; those of the second are not.<br\/><br\/>By the royal decree of February 13, 1894, it was enacted that all \"the land, soil, ground not under cultivation, and forests in the Philippine Islands should be considered saleable crown lands,\" which were not included in four exceptions stated, among which were \"those which belonged to forest zones which the State desires to hold for the Commonwealth.\"\u00a0 This corresponds in the main to the American classification into Government property, public lands, and forest reserve.\u00a0 Mineral lands are elsewhere defined.\u00a0 It is to be noted, however, that in the two languages terms ordinarily equivalent are not in this relation employed in the same sense and that lands, <i>de dominio publico<\/i> signify quite a different thing from the arbitrary English phrases \"public lands\" or \"public domain.\"<br\/><br\/>The Law of Waters of 1866, which was the latest Spanish Law of Waters extended to these Islands, provides that private property can not be acquired in lands preserving the character of public ownership (title 1, art. 1, par. 29), and among the lands declared of public ownership and use by article 1 of chapter 1 of title 5 of the same law are:<br\/><br\/>\"The seashore.-By shore is understood the land alternately covered and uncovered by the sea in its tidal movement Its interior, or laud limit, is the point reached by the highest and equinoctial tides.\u00a0 At those places not affected by tides, the land limit is the highest point reached by sea water in ordinary storms or hurricanes.\"\u00a0 (Par. 3.)<br\/><br\/>So that under this legislation the same question also presented itself as to what constituted seashore, which was of public use and trust and therefore not alienable.\u00a0 This question can not be said to have been settled by official ruling at the time of the American occupation.\u00a0 From the official records it appears that there were then pending for registration a great number of possessory <i>expedientes<\/i>, twenty-two of which, made before April 17, 1895, were from the Province of Pampanga alone, in which the land was described as <i>manglares<\/i>.\u00a0 Under the royal decree of 1894 such <i>manglares<\/i> appear at the outset to have been registered and considered alienable and numbers of them were conceded by adjustment, including considerable tracts in the town of Sexmoan and Lubao in Pampanga.\u00a0 Claims having been made that on account of the trees growing thereon they formed part of the forest reserve and also because, being covered and uncovered by the tide, they were part of the shore, and in either case were, inalienable, the engineer in chief of the forestry district of the center of Luzon addressed, on January 7, 1893, a communication to the <i>inspector general de montes<\/i> (Forestry Department) in which he expressed an opinion that as part of the shore they were not subject to private ownership and asked for an early decision of the question.\u00a0 On November 26,1893, the acting inspector-general notified the chief of the district of the Visayas in Mindanao that his excellency, the governor-general, had that day ordered all action suspended on <i>expedientes<\/i> of <i>manglar<\/i> and nipa lands and salt marshes until the questions involved in regard thereto should be determined.\u00a0 In this condition the matter remained until the expiration of the Spanish sovereignty.<br\/><br\/>By article 14 of the Law of Waters the right of shore fishery was declared public, but by article 23 authority might be granted individuals to establish shore hatcheries for fish and shellfish, and by article 15 salt-water ponds on private ground not communicating with the sea by water navigable by boats were recognized as private property, while chapter 10 permitted and regulated the draining of swamps and marshes, both of private and of public ownership.<br\/><br\/>Under this uncertain and somewhat unsatisfactory condition of the law the custom had grown up of converting <i>manglares<\/i> and nipa lands into fisheries which became a common feature of settlements along the coast and at the time of the change of sovereignty constituted one of the most productive industries of the Islands, the abrogation of which would destroy vested interests and prove a public disaster.\u00a0 In our opinion it was the object of Congress not to work such a result but, on the contrary, in furtherance of the purposes of the treaty of Paris, to recognize and safeguard such property.\u00a0 Therefore the judgment of the Court of Land Registration is affirmed, without costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa<\/i>, and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> Page 796, post. <br\/><br\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[2]<\/sup> Page 795, post.<br\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"><br\/>(1)<\/sup> Phil.

The Insular Government (10 Phil. Rep., 175) it is stated in the opinion, page 176 that-<br\/><br\/>\"The only question submitted to the court below or to this court by the Attorney-General is the question whether the land in controversy is agricultural land within the meaning of the section above quoted.\"<br\/><br\/>The section quoted is section 54, paragraph 6, of Act No. 926, in which the phrase used is \"agricultural <i>public lands<\/i>.\"<br\/><br\/>Throughout the opinion the phrase \"public lands\" is repeatedly and exclusively used.\u00a0 The entire discussion was directed to the question as to whether the property there in question being <i>\"public<\/i> land,\" it could be considered its <i>agricultural<\/i> public land, and the conclusion reached is stated at page 182, as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"In other words, that the phrase 'agricultural land,' as used in Act No. 920, means those public lands acquired from Spain which are not timber or mineral lands.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>In that case the land in question was a long distance from the sea.\u00a0 In fact, the entire town of Molo was between it and the water.\u00a0 It could in no sense be called tidal land.\u00a0 Therefore, the opinion was devoted to a consideration of not what were \"public lands\" but whether this particular tract was or was not agricultural public land.\u00a0 The question what the phrase \"public lands\" meant was neither considered nor decided in that opinion, for its resolution was not necessary.\u00a0 In the concurring opinion, however, that question was discussed and it was stated that the phrase \"public lands\" as used in Act No. 926 must be interpreted according to the American understanding of the words employed and the meaning of the terms as definitely fixed by the decrees of the United States Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>This statement was not necessary to the decision of the case then under discussion and was moreover, as I shall attempt to show hereafter, not a correct statement of the law.\u00a0 As to the other statement made in that opinion, to the effect that there may be real property belonging to the Government which would not be included in the phrase \"public lands,\" there can be no doubt concerning its correctness.\u00a0 This is and always has been apparent. It is indicated by articles 339 and 340 of the Civil Code, which are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 339. Property of public ownership is-<br\/><br\/>\"1.

That belonging exclusively to the State without being for public use and which is destined to some public service, or to the development of the national wealth, such as walls, fortresses, and other works for the defense of the territory, and mines, until their concession has been granted.<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 340.\u00a0 All other property belonging to the State which has not the conditions stated in the preceding article is considered as private property.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Articles 24 and 25 of the Regulations for the Execution of the Mortgage Law also indicate it. These articles are as follows :<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 24.\u00a0 All real estate and property rights thereto may be recorded, without exception, whether belonging to private parties, to the State, to the province, to the municipality, or to civil or ecclesiastical corporations.<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 25.\u00a0 Exceptions to the record required by article 2 of the law are:<br\/><br\/>\"First.\u00a0 Property which belongs exclusively to the eminent domain of the State, and which is for the use of all, such as the shores of the sea, islands, rivers and their borders, wagon roads, and roads of all kinds, with the exception of railroads; streets, parks, public promenades, and commons of towns, provided they are not lands of common profit to the inhabitants; walls of cities and parks, ports, and roadsteads, and any other analogous property luring the time they are in common and general use, always reserving the servitudes established by law on the hores of the sea and borders of navigable rivers.<br\/><br\/>\"Second.\u00a0 Public temples dedicated to the Catholic faith.\"\u00a0 In the Mapa case it was not necessary to decide, nor as it there decided, what the real property was which, longing to the Government, still would not come within the phrase \"public lands,\" nor how private persons could require rights in such property, nor whether that phrase would have the same meaning here as it has in the United States.\u00a0 In the present case, it is said in the opinion that all these five cases are of the same general character, and that the same rule should be applied to all.\"\u00a0 If it was not necessary to decide in the Mapa case the questions above mentioned, why is it necessary to discuss and decide them here?\u00a0 We are all agreed (1) that these lands are not tidal lands and are public lands, and (2) that they are agricultural lands.\u00a0 Having arrived at these conclusions, I see no reason for discussing the question as to what the result would be if they were tidal lands.\u00a0 It is apparent that anything said upon that question is not necessary to the decision of these cases and is <i>obiter dictum<\/i>.<br\/><\/blockquote>Whether Act No. 1654, relating to the reclaimed land in Manila near the Luneta, is authorized by section 11 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, or by section 12, is a question outside of the issues in the case at bar, and it seems unnecessary now to commit the court to any definite resolution thereof.\u00a0 If it is the purpose of the decision to announce the doctrine that rights in tidal waters in the Philippines must be governed by the principles already announced by the Supreme Court in the decisions cited, this objection attains greater force.\u00a0 Thus construed, it decides the rights of innumerable persons in the Islands who have reclaimed land from the sea and built upon it, none of whom has had an opportunity to be heard before his rights are thus decided.<br\/><br\/>These objections to the decision, on the ground that it discusses and apparently decides questions not before the court, and which affect parties not before it, would not be so serious if the conclusions reached were sound.\u00a0 But they are, as I believe, erroneous.\u00a0 The decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States cited in the opinion have nothing to do either with the question as to what rights private persons can acquire in tidal lands in the Philippines or with the meaning which should be given to the phrase \"public lands\" found in the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902.<br\/><br\/>1.\u00a0 Upon the first question as to private rights in tidal lands, it has been definitely settled by the Supreme Court at Washington in many decisions, which are collected in the case of Shively <i>vs<\/i>. Bowlby (152 U. S., 1), cited in the opinion, that the rights of private persons in such lands depend upon the law of the State where the lands are.\u00a0 The court said in that case (p. 40) :<br\/><blockquote>\"VII.\u00a0 The later judgments of this court clearly establish that the title and rights of riparian or littoral proprietors in the soil below high water mark of navigable waters are governed by the local laws of the several States, subject, of course, to the rights granted to the United States by the Constitution.<br\/><\/blockquote>It also appears from that case that these laws vary in different States.\u00a0 The court said, at page 26:<br\/><blockquote>\"The foregoing summary of the laws of the original States shows that there is no universal and uniform law upon the subject; but that each State has dealt with the lands under the tide waters within its borders according to its own views of justice and policy, reserving its own control over such lands, or granting rights therein to individuals or corporations, whether owners of the adjoining upland or not, as it considered for the best interests of the public.\u00a0 Great caution, therefore, is necessary in applying precedents in one State to cases arising in another.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In Massachusetts the owner of the upland is the owner in fee to the low-water mark if not beyond 100 rods.\u00a0 In other States he is the owner in fee only to high-water mark.\u00a0 In Minnesota the owner of the upland has the exclusive right to occupy the shore in front of his land, not only to low-water mark but even into the water to the point of navigability, and to occupy it for purely private purposes.\u00a0 And he is so far the owner of the land under water to the point of navigability that he can sell portions thereof and retain himself the shore line.\u00a0 (Hanford <i>vs<\/i>. St. Paul &amp; I). R. Co., 43 Minn., 104.)\u00a0 It will be observed that some of the cases cited in support of the decision in the case at bar arose in Massachusetts and Minnesota.\u00a0 The result is that when the Supreme Court of the United States decides a case relating to such lands it necessarily decides it according to the law of the State from which it comes.\u00a0 So that if any law of American origin is to be applied here it can not be a national law of waters, for none exists.\u00a0 It must necessarily be the law of some one of the different States.\u00a0 This would require a selection of the jurisprudence of one of those States which this court should not attempt to make.<br\/><br\/>At the cession of the Islands to the United States there was in force here a body of laws relating to this subject.\u00a0 These laws are still in force.\u00a0 They are found in the Law of Waters of 1866 and in articles 407 to 425 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 Cases which have heretofore arisen in this court have been decided with reference to these laws and not with reference to the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States relating to cases arising there.\u00a0 Among others are the cases of Ker &amp; Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Cauden (6 Phil. Rep., 732), and Jover <i>vs<\/i>. Insular Government<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">1<\/sup> (No. 2674, decided March 25, 1908).\u00a0 That questions relating to tidal lands should continue to be so decided seems to me free from doubt.\u00a0 It may be said that the decision does not intend to announce a contrary doctrine.\u00a0 If it does not, I see no purpose, for example, in the long citation from the case of Illinois Central R. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Illinois (146 U. S., 387), nor in the declaration that the purpose of the citation of these decisions is to show in the second place that rights in tidal lands are not under the legislation of Congress the subject of private property.<br\/><br\/>2. The second question relates to the meaning which should be given to the phrase \"public lands\" in the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902. In the concurring opinion in the Mapa case it was stated, as has been seen, that it has the same meaning here as in the United States.\u00a0 This doctrine seems to be reiterated in the opinion in this case.\u00a0 After announcing it in unequivocal terms, it is said, to be sure, that the result would be the same if the words were to be construed with reference to the local law.\u00a0 This would be true if the-laws of the two jurisdictions were the same.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But it is easily demonstrated that they are not.<br\/><br\/>With reference to tidal lands, we have seen that in some of the States private persons are the owners of the land between high and low water mark.\u00a0 By the Law of Waters of 1866, and article 339 of the Civil Code, the shore or beach is public property.\u00a0 It not only does not belong to private persons, but it is not even the private property of the State.<br\/><br\/>The difference between the two systems is more marked when we consider public roads and streets and the beds of nonnavigable rivers.\u00a0 By the common law of England, which has been followed by and is now in force in a great many of the States, the beds of such rivers belong to the owners of the adjoining land.\u00a0 But by the law here in force (arts. 339 and 407, Civil Code) they are public property and can not be considered even as the private property of the State.\u00a0 The same is true of streets and roads.\u00a0 (Arts. 339 and 344, Civil Code.)\u00a0 When the United States issues a patent for public land owned by it, situated in the State of Minnesota, for example, and bounded by a nonnavigable river, the patentee becomes the owner of one-half of the bed of the river.\u00a0 When the Spanish Government issued a patent for land in the Philippines bounded by a river, the patentee did not become the owner of the bed of the river.\u00a0 His ownership extended only to low-water mark.<br\/><br\/>What has been said of rivers is true of roads.\u00a0 If the phrase \"public lands\" be given the meaning here that it has in the United States, whenever the Director of Public Lands grants a patent for land bounded by a nonnavigable river or road the patentee will become the owner of one-half of the bed of the river and one-half of the road.\u00a0 This result would be in direct conflict with the articles of the Civil Code above cited, and would amount to a repeal thereof.\u00a0 Such a result Congress never could have intended. Prior to the treaty of Paris the Spanish Government was the owner of the roads and the beds of streams in the Philippines in trust for the benefit of all the people.\u00a0 The treaty itself did not change this status.\u00a0 On the contrary, it preserved' rights of property as they then existed.\u00a0 By the treaty, the United States acquired the interest which the Spanish Government had in roads and the beds of streams.\u00a0 It did not become the absolute owner thereof.<br\/><br\/>The laws of Spain relating to this matter were continued in force by the proclamation of General Merritt.\u00a0 This would have been the result even without any proclamation.\u00a0 (American Ins. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Canter, 1 Pet, 511.)\u00a0 They are in force now, and the Government is still the owner of roads and the beds of rivers unless Congress by the use of the phrase \"public lands\" in the Act of July 1, 1902, has repealed the articles of the Civil Code above cited.\u00a0 I do not think that such an intention can be attributed to it.\u00a0 It is more reasonable to say that it intended to give to the phrase the meaning which was given to it by the laws in force in the territory where the Act was to take effect.\u00a0 And this intention is more apparent when we consider that there then existed article 340 of the Civil Code, which contained a complete definition of these lands belonging to the Government, which it had a right to dispose of as private property.\u00a0 It had no intention of disposing of property which it held in trust.\u00a0 The property which the Commission intended to dispose of by Act No. 926 was undoubtedly the private property of the State as defined by article 340.<br\/><br\/>To say that Congress had a different purpose would be to attribute to it an intention to discriminate against the Philippines and to impose upon the Islands laws other than those there in force, a thing which it has never done when legislating in regard to its land situated within a particular State.\u00a0 As we have seen, it has always allowed each State to determine for itself the laws which shall govern real estate within its borders. When this court is called upon to define the phrase \"public; lands\" as used in the Act of Congress and in Act No. 926, it should in my opinion say that it includes the property described in article 340 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above stated, I agree with the result in this case, but I dissent from those parts of the opinion which I have discussed.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">1<\/sup>10 Phil.

JOSE MCMICKING, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 5th day of February, 1909, the plaintiff commenced an action in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila to recover the possession of certain personal property mentioned in paragraph 1 of the complaint, or in default thereof the sum of P1,500, its value, and costs.  The defendant filed a general denial.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the lower court rendered a judgment adjudging to Herbert S. Walker, the right to recover the articles mentioned in paragraph 1 of the complaint, of the defendant, or in default, the sum of P539, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, from February 6, 1909.<br\/><br\/>From this judgment the defendant appealed and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"1.  The court erred in holding that the attachment of December 17,1908, was null as to this defendant.<br\/>\"2.  The court erred in holding that the sale of June 16, 1908, was rescinded in a way affecting this  defendant.<br\/>\"3.  The court erred in holding that the rescission does not involve  a precedent condition to return the amounts paid on account of the purchase price.<br\/>\"4.  The court erred in making an excessive valuation of the goods in question.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>Under the first above assignment of error, the appellant contends that the lower court committed an error in holding that the attachment of the 17th of December, 1908, was null and void.  The appellant relies upon Exhibit 1 (the writ of attachment) for the purpose of showing that said attachment was valid.  Exhibit 1 was not made a part of the record in this court.  We can not, therefore, examine it for the purpose of ascertaining just what its contents were.  The lower court, in discussing the validity of said attachment and its effect upon the present action, said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The defendant is not sued in any official capacity, nor does he, in answer, or elsewhere, claim any such status.  In fact his answer is only a general denial.  He offers in evidence, however, a writ of attachment (Exhibit 1) issued by one of the judges of this court on December 16, 1908, on the back of which appears an indorsement to the effect that the sheriff of Manila delivered a copy of the writ and affidavit upon which the same was founded, to Arenas &amp; Co. and that said sheriff attached certain articles therein mentioned, some of which appear to be similar to those in controversy, though the identity does not seem to be clearly established.  The indorsement further recites that 'the goods are found deposited * * * in the possession of the same defendants according to a stipulation signed by both parties which is attached to this writ.  The attached stipulation recites that all the goods attached 'shall remain in the possession of the same defendants, <i>relieving the sheriff of all responsibility as regards the care and custody thereof<\/i>.'  Plaintiff Rohde further testifies (p. 13) that he never heard of the attachment until about the 29th of January, that he continued in possession from the time Arenas surrendered to him and that the latter was permitted to enter only for the purpose of preparing the articles for sale.<br\/><br\/>\"Section 428 of the Code of Civil Procedure requires:  'The order of attachment shall be served by the officer of the court by attaching, and safely keeping all the movable property of the defendant.'<br\/><br\/>\"It will be seem from the recitals above quoted that the sheriff never claims to have taken into his 'keeping' the articles in controversy, but, on the contrary, left them with the attachment defendants, expressly relieving himself of all responsibility.  This is clearly not a compliance with the statute and did not effect a valid attachment.  A mere verbal declaration of seizure or service of writ is insufficient.  (Hollister <i>vs.<\/i> Goodale, 21  Am. Dec, 674; Jones <i>vs.<\/i> Howard, 59 Am. St. Rep., 231; Miles <i>vs.<\/i> Brown, 38 N. Y. Supr. Ct., 400.)  There must be actual assumption of control (4 Cyc, 484, 485.)  This is not saying that a defendant may not be custodian; but the possession and responsibility  must be the sheriff's and not the defendant's.  If as stated in defendant's brief, such an arrangement is an everyday occurrence in attachment levies, here the vice of it can not too soon be declared.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The facts presented by a preponderance of the evidence seem to be as follows:<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, Walker, was the owner of a Filipino carriage factory.  The  building in  which the factory was operated and its contents were, on the 30th of June, 1908, sold to a partnership known as \"Arenas &amp; Co.,\" by plaintiff, Walker, whose ownership, at the time of the sale, was not disputed by any of the parties to this action.  The contract was evidenced by a writing (Exhibit A), from which it appears that the said company was to pay for the said factory and its contents the sum of P3,200, P600 of which was paid at the time of the sale (June 30, 1908) and the balance was to be paid in three installments, due, respectively, P600 on the 15th of July, 1908, Pl,000 due on the 15th of September, 1908, and P1,000 due on the 31st of December, 1908.  The said company paid the installment due on the 15th of July, 1908, but failed to pay said installments due in September and December.  Paragraph 4 of said contract (Exhibit A) contains the following provision:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"That, should the said firm of Arenas &amp; Co. not pay me the amounts agreed to on the dates stated  in the previous paragraph or within the thirty days following any of the said terms, <i>the present sale shall be rescinded, and I, Herbert S. Walker, shall be entitled to take possession of the building as well as of the business and all the goods constituting the same.\"<\/i><br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The said company having failed to pay the second and third installments due respectively in September and December, as above indicated, the plaintiff Walker, early in the month of January, 1909, by virtue of the said provision of the contract, rescinded said sale and took  possession of said factory with its contents.  The factory was located upon land belonging to the plaintiff Rohde.  The said company had failed for some months to pay the rent for the land.  The plaintiff Rohde claimed that by virtue of the provisions of paragraph 7 of article 1922 of the Civil Code that he had a preferred claim against the said factory and its contents for the payment of the rent.  The plaintiff Rohde, acting for himself and for the plaintiff Walker, took possession of said factory and its contents, on or about the first of January, 1909.  Mr. Rohde testified that at the time he took possession of said factory, representing himself and the said Walker, there was no one in possession of said property except the said Arenas &amp; Co., and that Arenas &amp; Co. turned said property over to him <i>without any objection whatever<\/i>, in fact, that the delivery was made by mutual consent and agreement.<br\/><br\/>It appears, however, that on or about the 16th of December, 1908, the defendant, acting as sheriff of the city of Manila, levied an attachment upon the said factory and its contents, by virtue of a judgment theretofore rendered against the said Arenas &amp; Co.  The record does not disclose fully just what was done in effecting said attachment.  It appears, however, by an indorsement upon said alleged writ of attachment, or perhaps by a stipulation between the parties (to the attachment), that the goods attached \"shall remain in the possession of the same defendants, relieving the sheriff of all responsibility as regards the care and custody thereof.\"<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff Rohde testified that he had never heard of said attachment until about the 29th of January, 1909; that he continued in possession from the time (about January 1) that Arenas &amp; Co. surrendered possession to him, and that Arenas &amp; Co. was only permitted to enter the premises thereafter for the purpose of preparing the contents of said factory for sale.<br\/><br\/>The evident theory of the defendant  and appellant is that the attachment had the effect of defeating the right of the plaintiffs in said factory and its contents.  It appears in the record, that in some way the defendant obtained possession of the articles mentioned  in paragraph 1 of the complaint, and that some time early in the month of February, 1909, they were sold for the sum of P191, and a few cents.  It is not suggested in the record that the defendant, McMicking, is sued as sheriff.  The defendant does not pretend'that what he did was done as sheriff.  The plaintiff does not attempt to recover of the defendant as sheriff.  The pretension of the plaintiff is that the defendant, Jose McMicking, took possession of certain personal property, and retains the possession of the same, which belongs to them.  Even admitting that the defendant did, by virtue of an attachment, as sheriff, pretend to take possession of the property in question, the plaintiffs contend that the attachment was void for the reason that the defendant, as sheriff, did not comply with the law in levying the said attachment.<br\/><br\/>The lower court, basing his conclusions upon the provisions of section 428 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, held that the  attachment was null for the reason that the defendant did not comply with said section.  Section 428 provides that-<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The order of attachment shall be served by the officer of the court by attaching and safely keeping all the movable property of the defendant in the Philippine Islands, or so much thereof as may be sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's demands, unless the defendant gives security by obligation to the plaintiff, with sufficient surety, to be approved by the judge who granted the order of attachment, in an amount sufficient to satisfy such demands besides costs, * * *.  The property so attached shall be held to await final judgment in execution, unless released as provided in this section or section four hundred and forty.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>It will be noted, even admitting that the defendant is here sued as sheriff, and that his responsibility in this action is as sheriff, that he did not comply with said section 428, in making said attachment.  He did not  attach and safely keep the movable property attached.  A verbal declaration of seizure or service of a writ of attachment is not sufficient.  There must be an actual taking of possession and placing the attached property under the control of the officer or someone representing him.  (Hollister <i>vs.<\/i> Goodale, 8 Conn., 332, 21 Am. Dec, 674; Jones <i>vs.<\/i> Howard, 99 Ga., 451, 59 Am. St. Rep., 231.)<br\/><br\/>We believe that under said section 428 to constitute a valid levy of an attachment, the officer levying it must take actual possession of the property attached as far as under the circumstances is practicable.  He must put himself in position to, and must assert and, in fact, enforce a dominion over the property'adverse to and exclusive of the attachment debtor, and such property must be in his  substantial presence and possession.  (Corniff <i>vs.<\/i> Cook, 95 Ga., 61, 51 Am. St. Rep., 55, 61.)  Of course, this does not mean that the attaching officer may not, under an arrangement satisfactory to himself, put anyone in possession of the property for the purpose of guarding it, but he can not in this way relieve himself from liability to the parties interested in said attachment.  <br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion, and so hold, that the attachment was not properly made in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.  There is no pretension, however, in the record, on the part of the defendant, that he attached said property and held the same by virtue of such attachment.  Even though this defense had been made by the defendant, which is only made by his attorney, it would be an admission of the principal facts alleged by the plaintiffs in their complaint-to wit, that he had taken possession of personal property belonging to them.  The defense made by the defendant is new  matter, to which no reference whatever was made in the pleadings, and it is, therefore, upon the whole, inadmissible.  Facts not alleged in the pleadings but offered as evidence, which admit the facts alleged, but tend to confess and avoid the facts alleged, are not admissible in evidence.  (Bliss on Code Pleadings, 3d ed., 427, and cases cited.)  For example:  A sues  B on a promissory note, setting up the necessary facts in his petition.  B answered by a general denial.  B's real defense is prescription.  B will not be permitted to prove 'prescription for the reasons that (a) he denied the existence of the debt, and (b) by his evidence tending to show that the said debt is prescribed, he thereby admits the existence of the debt, which is a confession of his liability.  In other words, the defense of prescription is a confession and an avoidance of the obligation.<br\/><br\/>Under the second assignment of error the appellant contends that the original sale of said factory and its contents had not been rescinded by the plaintiffs herein in a manner which in any way affected the defendant.  The fourth clause of the contract of sale (Exhibit A) quoted above, gave the vendor of said factory and contents the right to rescind the sale for a failure to pay any of the subsequent installments.  The plaintiffs testified during the trial that the second installment had not been paid, in accordance with the terms of the contract and that he, therefore, rescinded the contract of sale, to which rescission, the said company (the purchaser) acceded and delivered to the plaintiff Walker the said carriage factory and its contents.  No allegation is made by the defendant that either the contract or the rescission of the contract  was corruptly made, or for the purpose of defrauding any of the creditors.  Exhibit A was the contract between the said company and the plaintiff Walker.  It constituted that law covering the rights of the respective parties to it.  (Arts. 1254 and 1255, Civil Code.)  The plaintiff Walker did all that was necessary for him to do to rescind said contract.<br\/><br\/>Under the third assignment of error, the appellant insists that the contract could not be rescinded by Walker without returning to Arenas &amp;  Co. the amount of money which Arenas &amp; Co. had paid on said contract, and cites several provisions of the Civil Code in support of his contention, especially  article 1295.  Arenas &amp; Co. are not parties to this action.  Arenas &amp;  Co. have made no claim for the return of the money which they paid on said contract.  If they have a right to a return of the money which they paid on said contract upon a rescission by Walker, a question which we do not now decide, they are the only ones which can insist upon it.  No such claim is here made.  It is not a right which the defendant in this action can insist upon.  This question is not involved in the present action for the reason that Arenas &amp; Co. make no such claim.  They are not parties to this action.<br\/><br\/>Under the fourth assignment of error, the defendant insists or contends that the value allowed by the lower court for the property in question was excessive.  Upon an examination of  the evidence brought to this court, relating to the value of the property in question, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the lower court committed no error in fixing the value of said property at the sum of P539.  The price obtained for property under a forced sale is not a fair criterion for the purpose of ascertaining the true value of such property.<br\/><br\/>We have discussed at length the assignments of error made by the appellant, but in our opinion the whole case may be stated briefly as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>First.  The defendant attached certain property under a writ of execution issued by one of the courts of the city of Manila, which attachment was levied upon the property in question.  This attachment, however, was rendered invalid and of no effect for the reason that the defendant did not maintain his control over the same, either personally or by his representatives.  The attachment became invalid the moment the sheriff lost either his actual or constructive-control over the property.<br\/><br\/>Second.  The plaintiffs herein, innocently and in good faith and under a right, acquired possession of the property in question.<br\/><br\/>Third.  That subsequent to the acquisition of the possession by the plaintiffs, the defendant, in some way which does not appear of record, acquired possession of the property in question, and admits that he subsequently sold it.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.  The plaintiffs allege that the defendant is in possession of property belonging to them, and prays that the same may be returned or its value.  The defendant denies (general denial) that he has the possession of the property.  The evidence clearly shows that the defendant did take possession of property which was rightfully in possession of the plaintiffs.  He is therefore liable, either to return said property or its value.<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>For all of the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion and so hold that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, with costs.   So ordered.<br\/><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Carson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Elliott, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

No. 4130, April 12, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>RUPINO BA\u00d1ES ET AL., PETITIONERS AND APPELLANTS, <i>VS.<\/i> JACINTO CORDERO ET AL., RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MAPA, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The petitioners herein, residents of the municipality of Narvacan, Province of Ilocos Sur, were registered as electors qualified to vote in the municipal elections held in said municipality on December 5, 1905.\u00a0 The board of election judges heard the objections presented against their qualification, and decided that their names should be stricken off the list, on the ground of their having violated their oath of allegiance to the United States of America, and hence were unable to vote at said elections.\u00a0 After the close of the elections, these petitioners filed a protest against the legality and validity thereof, basing their contention on the fact that they had been deprived of the right which they alleged they possessed to cast their votes, at the elections.\u00a0 The proper certificate of said elections, together with the protests filed, were forwarded to the provincial board, and that body, by a resolution passed on December 23, 1905, approved the elections and held them to be legal, and the protest filed by these petitioners was therefore dismissed.<br\/><br\/>The petitioners thereupon applied to the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur for a writ of certiorari against the members of the election board of Narvacan and the provincial board of Ilocos Sur, alleging that the latter exceeded their powers in dismissing the protest and in approving the elections.\u00a0 The court denied the remedy sought, and the petitioners have appealed from the judgment.<br\/><br\/>These events took place before the passage of the present Election Law, and should therefore be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Municipal Code (Act No. 82).<br\/><br\/>Section 9, paragraph (b), of this Act, besides providing for the preparation of a list of qualified electors by the municipal president, prescribes that:<br\/><blockquote>\"He shall further prepare and cause to be posted in a public and conspicuous place in each barrio an alphabetical list of the qualified electors residing between its limits.\u00a0 Each list shall be accompanied by a notice specifying a term of five days prior to the election during which any qualified elector may demand his propel enrollment as such, or the exclusion from the list of qualified electors of the name of any person not possessing the right to vote.\u00a0 Such demands shall be made to the president, who shall promptly refer them for settlement to a board consisting of the vice-president, the municipal treasurer, and himself. * * * The questions raised before said board shall be determined before the date of the pending election, and the determinations shall be immediately communicated in writing to the person whose qualifications as an elector are in question.\" <\/blockquote> Paragraph (b) of section 13 of the same Act No. 82, provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"On the day following said term of three days a duplicate of the election certificate and the objections made, if any, shall be sent by the chairman of the board of judges to the provincial board.\u00a0 Should the provincial board, upon investigation and after hearing of evidence, if necessary, find the election legal, they shall, within seven days after the receipt of said documents, direct the newly elected officers to qualify and enter upon their duties on the day fixed by this Act, but, if the provincial board determine that there has been an illegality committed in the election of any officer or that any candidate returned is not eligible, they shall so declare in writing, with the reasons therefor, and shall order a special election to fill the vacancies thus occasioned and shall certify their finding and order to the municipal secretary, who shall spread the same on the records of the council.\u00a0 In determining the legality of the election, the provincial board shall ignore irregularities or informalities which do not prevent the declared result from being the actual will of the electors.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>As will be seen, the first provision of the law quoted above confers upon the board of judges the power to determine questions as to the qualification or disqualification of any elector, while the last-quoted provision vests in the provincial boards power to approve or disapprove the municipal elections after hearing and determining the protests filed.\u00a0 Therefore, the election board of Narvacan acted within the scope of their powers in finding that the petitioners lacked the necessary qualifications to become electors and in ordering that their names be stricken off the list of qualified electors, and in like manner the provincial board of Ilocos Sur acted within their powers in approving the municipal elections of Narvacan and in dismissing the protest filed by the petitioners.<br\/><br\/>And, if the jurisdiction has not been exceeded, there is not nor could there be any legal ground for the issuance of the writ of certiorari, because these proceedings can only and exclusively be granted to remedy abuses committed in the exercise of a power or jurisdiction.\u00a0 Sections 217 and 514 of the Code of Civil Procedure providing for such relief, unequivocally and specifically refer to the act of exceeding or going beyond the jurisdiction; and this court has repeatedly held that, in order that certiorari may issue, it is absolutely necessary to show that the respondent has exceeded his power or jurisdiction.\u00a0 (<i>In re<\/i> Prautch, No. 581, 1 Phil. Rep., 132; De los Reyes <i>vs.<\/i> Roxas, No. 1156, 1 Phil. Rep., 625; Springer <i>vs.<\/i> Odlin, No. 1372, 3 Phil. Rep., 344.)<br\/><br\/>It is unnecessary for us to discuss in this opinion the other points raised by the appellants in their brief, because they have no bearing on the main issue of this case and will in noway affect the result.\u00a0 Even though the respondents had been held in default, or a date previous to the hearing of the case had been assigned for the filing of their answer, or even though it was held that the facts in controversy are within the scope of a writ of mandamus, which in sum is what the appellants claim in raising these questions, there is no ground for the issuance of the writ of certiorari sought by them, inasmuch as it appears, in a manner which leaves no room for doubt, that the respondents have not exceeded the powers expressly vested in them by law.<br\/><br\/>The order appealed from is affirmed with the costs of this instance <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres<\/i> and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

to jointly and separately indemnify the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino in the sum of P2,273, Philippine currency, and in the event of insolvency, to suffer subsidiary imprisonment for the time and in the manner and place prescribed by law.<br\/><br\/>The information charged:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"That on or about the 6th day of October, 1906, in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) and Luciano de los Reyes, conspiring and confederating together, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, and with intent of gain, defraud El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino, a corporation then and there duly organized, existing and doing a general banking business in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, of and in the sum of two thousand (P2,000) pesos, Philippine currency, by then and there pretending and representing that the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) did then and there possess property and credit which the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) did not possess and the use of other similar deceit, in this, to wit:\u00a0 That on or about the said 6th day of October, 1906, the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) then and there prepared, drew, executed, signed, presented, and caused to be presented for payment to the said El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino his personal check upon the said El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino, then and there doing a general banking business in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, as aforesaid, for the sum of two thousand (P2,000) pesos, Philippine\u00a0 currency, a true copy of which check, together with all the indorsements and notations thereon, made both before and after the same was paid by the said El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino, is hereto attached, marked 'Exhibit A,' and made a part hereof, and the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) and Luciano de los Reyes, each well knowing that the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) did not then and there have any funds to his credit in said bank, and conniving, conspiring and concerting together to defraud said bank as aforesaid, did then and there falsely and fraudulently state and represent to said bank and its agents, and particularly to Lino Eguia, one of the agents and the cashier of said bank; that the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) then and there had sufficient funds deposited to his credit in said bank to meet and pay said check and that the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) was then and there a creditor of said bank in an amount more than equal to said check and that the said bank was obligated to pay and should then and there pay to the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) the amount of said check; that the said Luciano de los Reyes was then and there a clerk in the banking institution of 'El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino' and as such was in charge of the book containing the entry and record of the account of the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) with said 'El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino' and the said Luciano de los Reyes, cooperating, as aforesaid, with the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) to defraud the said 'El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino,' at the request and in cooperation with the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco), did then and there falsely state and cause it to appear upon the books of the said bank and in the account of the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) that the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco, (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) had to his credit in said bank more than enough to pay the said check of two thousand (P2,000) pesos, and was then and there a creditor of said bank in more than the amount of said check; and did further then and there, falsely and fraudulently in combination with the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco), as afore-said place upon the back of said check over his signature the word <i>'corriente,'<\/i> thereby stating and causing it to appear and be understood by the said 'El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino' and its agents, and particularly the said Lino Eguia, agent and cashier of said bank, that the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) had then and there deposited to his credit in said bank funds more than sufficient to pay the amount of said check and that the said 'El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino' was obligated then and there to pay and should pay to the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco), the amount of said check; that relying on the false and fraudulent representations, as aforesaid, of the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco), and Luciano de los Reyes the said 'El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino' was induced to pay and did pay to the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco) and his order the said sum of two thousand (P2,000) pesos, Philippine currency, which said sum the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco), and the said Luciano de los Reyes then and there converted to their own use, to the damage and prejudice of the said 'El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino' in the said sum of two thousand (P2,000) pesos, Philippine currency, equivalent to and of the value of ten thousand pesetas, Philippine currency.<br\/><br\/>\"All contrary to law.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The evidence shows conclusively that for at least three and a half years prior to the 6th day of October, 1906, Luciano de los Reyes was employed in the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino, and there served and acted as bookkeeper and check registry clerk.\u00a0 During that time he was in charge of certain current account-books of the bank, and it was his duty to inspect certain checks presented to the bank for payment, including those drawn by Lim Buanco; to examine the account of the maker of said checks, and determine whether or not the drawer of the check had a sufficient balance to his credit to justify the payment of the check.\u00a0 In the performance of these duties, Reyes was required to indorse upon each check, if it was entitled to payment, the words <i>\"Corriente<\/i>.\u00a0 P. O. Luciano de los Reyes.\"\u00a0 After the check was marked in this manner it was passed to the cashier of the bank, who in reliance upon the indorsement, paid or ordered the same to be paid.<br\/><br\/>During the period referred to the defendant Lim Buanco had an account with the bank, and drew large sums of money therefrom by means of checks signed by him, and inspected and indorsed as above by Reyes.<br\/><br\/>During this time a conspiracy existed between the defendants Lim Buanco and Reyes for the withdrawal of funds from the bank by Lim Buanco, regardless of whether he had any funds in the bank to his credit, and in furtherance of this conspiracy the entries in the account of Lim Buanco on the books of the bank were fraudulently and illegally manipulated by Reyes in such a manner as to make the books show an apparent credit balance, when in fact Lim Buanco was owing the bank a large amount of money.<br\/><br\/>On the 6th day of October, 1906, Lim Buanco drew a check on the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino for the sum of P2,000, and this check was through the agency of another bank in which it was deposited by Lim Buanco, presented in due course of\u00a0 business to and paid by the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino.\u00a0 Before the check was thus paid, Reyes, acting in his capacity as an employee of the bank, indorsed thereon the\u00a0 words <i>\"Corriente<\/i>.\u00a0 P. O. Luciano de los Reyes,' although at the time when this indorsement was made Lim Buanco had no actual credit balance in the bank, and no permission had been given him by any officer or officers in authority of said bank to overdraw his account.\u00a0 In this manner the defendants Lim Buanco and Reyes, in furtherance of the conspiracy to cheat, deceive, and defraud the bank, secured the payment of the check, although they both knew at the time that the defendant Lim Buanco had no credit balance in said bank, but was in fact indebted to the bank in the sum of more than 300,000 pesos, which had previously been withdrawn from the bank by means of similar checks drawn by Lim Buanco and fraudulently indorsed as correct by Reyes.<br\/><br\/>The amount of money thus fraudulently obtained from the bank by means of the check as aforesaid, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the date of the check to the date of the decision in the court below, to wit, January 16, 1909, amounted to the sum of P2,273, Philippine currency, equivalent to 11,365 pesetas, which the court determined to be the damage occasioned to and suffered by the bank by reason of the aforesaid fraudulent conduct of the defendants, acting together in furtherance of said conspiracy.\u00a0 No part of the said sum has been\u00a0 returned or paid back to the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino by Lim Buanco, or by Reyes, or by any person acting for or in his or their behalf.\u00a0 The trial court also found that Lim Buanco and Reyes each had voluntarily admitted the crime as charged against him.<br\/><br\/>Separate trials were granted to the defendants, but the court, after both were convicted, embodied its findings of facts and conclusions in one decision, and one joint sentence was pronounced upon the defendants.\u00a0 Thereafter each defendant separately moved for a new trial, which was denied, and an appeal was taken to this\u00a0 court, where, as in the court below, they appear by separate attorneys.\u00a0 Although separate briefs are filed, the various assignments of errors raise essentially the same questions.<br\/><br\/>1. It appears that the court in fact granted the motion of the defendants for separate trials, and that Lim Buanco was tried on January 7 and 12, 1909.\u00a0 This trial was followed immediately by that of Reyes, and on January 16, after both trials were completed, the court announced its findings of facts and conclusions in each, case in one decision, and imposed one sentence which included both defendants.\u00a0 The practice of entering one sentence against several defendants thus jointly charged and separately tried is not that which prevails in the United States, but it was approved by this court in United States <i>vs.<\/i> Fernandez (9 Phil. Rep., 269), and in the recent case of United States <i>vs.<\/i> Raymundo, No. 4947.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup><br\/><br\/>It appears clearly that the sentence as to each defendant was based upon the evidence submitted upon the separate trial of his case.\u00a0 Every right intended to be protected, and every purpose sought to be effected by the privilege of a separate trial were effectually preserved.\u00a0 No rights which accrue to a defendant after the decision and sentence can be prejudicially affected by the fact that another defendant is included in that sentence.\u00a0 The right of each to move for a new trial, and to appeal and have his appeal considered upon the record made in his case is preserved unimpaired, and in its entirety.\u00a0 The practice is convenient, and saves much time and labor, and as it can in no way prejudice the rights of a defendant, there is no reason why it should not be approved.<br\/><br\/>2. In the statement preliminary to the findings, and by way of recital, the trial court stated that neither of the defendants testified as a witness in his own behalf.\u00a0 The defendants contend that this was a violation of their constitutional right.\u00a0 In proceedings under the jury system it is generally provided by statute that the court must not in the presence of the jury refer to the fact that the defendant has availed himself of the right to\u00a0 decline to be a witness, but much of the importance of the matter disappears when the case is tried by a court without a jury.\u00a0 The judge is necessarily in possession of the fact that the defendant has a right to testify or not, as he may be advised, and this statutory prohibition is upon\u00a0 the court drawing any inference of guilt from the fact that the defendant elects not to testify.\u00a0 Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, a defendant has the right to\u00a0 appear and defend in person or by counsel, and if he offers himself as a witness he may be cross-examined as any other witness, but \"his neglect or refusal to be a witness shall in no manner prejudice or be used against him.\"\u00a0 The question under this statute is not whether the court referred to the fact that the defendant did not testify, but whether his failure to testify was used to his prejudice.\u00a0 The reference here is in the preliminary statements and it is very clear from the entire proceedings and the sentence that this circumstance was not considered as an evidential fact, and that it in no manner affected the conclusion reached by the court upon the question of the guilt of the defendants or either of them.<br\/><br\/>3. It is urged that the complaint does not allege facts sufficient to constitute the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>, because it does not allege specifically that Lim Buanco did not at the time when the check was drawn have funds to his credit in the bank sufficient to pay the check.\u00a0 The position is without merit, because the complaint does in fact allege that the check was drawn by Lim Buanco, and \"that the said Lino Eguia Lim Buanco (<i>alias<\/i> Lim Buanco), and Luciano de los Reyes, each well knowing that the said Lim Buanco did\u00a0 not then and there have any funds to his credit in said bank, and conniving, conspiring and concerting together to defraud the bank, etc.\"\u00a0 Under the liberal rule of construction prescribed by General Orders, No. 58, and frequently approved by this court, this, when read in connection with the rest of the complaint, must be construed as a sufficient allegation that both Lim Buanco and Reyes when the check was drawn knew that Lim Buanco did not have sufficient money in the bank to pay the same.\u00a0 (See U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Cajayon, 2 Phil. Rep., 570.)<br\/><br\/>It is also claimed that the court erred in finding the defendants guilty of the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>, because the evidence fails to prove the essential elements necessary to constitute this offense.\u00a0 This claim rests upon the assertion that the evidence shows that the money must have been obtained with the consent of the bank; that Lim Buanco never presented the check to the bank, or made any representations to the bank nor any person that he had sufficient money in the bank to pay the check; that he merely used the check in his commercial transactions with the Chartered Bank, of India, Australia, and China, and had it credited to his account in that bank, with the understanding that it would be presented to the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino, and if paid, the credit should stand; otherwise it should be canceled.\u00a0 It is true that Lim Buanco drew the check and deposited it to his own credit in the Chartered Bank\u00a0 of India, Australia, and China, by which it was presented for payment to the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino, upon which it was drawn.\u00a0 The Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China was not defrauded, because the check was in fact paid.\u00a0 The implied representation to the Chartered Bank that the check would be paid in the ordinary course of business was made good, and therefore the Chartered Bank suffered no loss, but the argument based on this fact loses sight of the real offense which was committed against the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino.\u00a0 That bank never intended to allow Lim Buanco to overdraw his account, although it did intend to pay the check; that is, it intended to perform the physical act of paying the check, but that act was induced by the combined fraudulent act of Lim Buanco and Reyes.\u00a0 Through the fraudulent machinations and devices of these two defendants, the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino was induced to part with its money.\u00a0 In order to obtain this result, Lim Buanco drew the check, and Reyes, acting and operating in connection with him, falsified the records of the bank, and thus accomplished their fraudulent purpose.\u00a0 The allegation in the information, and the statement in the findings of the trial court, that the defendants conspired and confederated\u00a0 together to defraud the bank, and that in furtherance of the conspiracy the defendants did defraud the bank, means no more than\u00a0 that they operated together, and so operating succeeded in defrauding the bank.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendant Reyes contends that the court committed an error in holding that the evidence shows that Reyes is guilty as principal of the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>.\u00a0 Upon this record we are satisfied that both the defendants are equally guilty.\u00a0 Each performed the part which was necessary to enable them to accomplish the criminal purpose they had in view.\u00a0 Article 535 of the Penal Code says that:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The following shall incur the penalties of the preceding articles:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"1. He who shall defraud others by using a fictitious name, by assuming fictititous power, influence, or attributes, or by pretending to possess imaginary property, credit, commission, enterprises, or business, or by using any other similar deceit that is not one of those mentioned in the following cases.\"<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><br\/>Lim Buanco certainly by implication represented to the bank that he possessed a credit to which he was not entitled, and with the assistance of Reyes he gave that claim the color of truth, and thus deceived the bank.\u00a0 The fact that Reyes falsified the accounts-current of Lim Buanco, making him appear as a creditor when as a matter of fact he was a debtor of the bank, together with the fact that he acted in collusion with Lim Buanco, made him guilty of a deceit under the province of the paragraph above quoted.\u00a0 We can not see that this conclusion is in the least affected by the fact that under the by-laws of the bank it may have been the duty of the directors of the bank to ascertain<br\/>the correctness of the\u00a0 entries made by Reyes before the payment of the check.\u00a0 The fraudulent conduct of Reyes can not be deprived of its criminal character by the fact that other officers, directors, or employees of the bank may have been careless in the performance of their duties.\u00a0 Whatever may have been the strict duty of the other officers of the bank, the fact remains that Reyes was guilty of fraudulently manipulating the records of the bank, and he can not escape the legal consequences thereof by showing that if others had properly performed their duties he would not have been able to have accomplished anything by his fraudulent acts.\u00a0 We are referred to a judgment of the supreme court of\u00a0 Spain of March 22, 1871, to the effect that one who misstates the boundaries of land\u00a0 upon which he places a mortgage to secure the payment of a loan of money, is not guilty of the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>, because such misstatement did not amount to a false representation that he owned any property, credits, or business which he did not have.\u00a0 We can not see that this decision\u00a0 is at all applicable to the present case.\u00a0 Here the bank was deceived by the affirmative act of Reyes, acting in conjunction with Lim Buanco.\u00a0 In the case referred to the boundaries of the land were well known, and the creditor had the right to ascertain for himself the superficial area of the property before he accepted the same as security.\u00a0 Had the party by some fraudulent suggestion or device misrepresented the area of the land, and prevented the person to whom he was giving the mortgage from making any examination for himself, it is probable that a different conclusion would have been reached.<br\/><br\/>It is impossible to accept the\u00a0 contention that this was merely a case of overdraft on the part of Lim Buanco, and that the bank intentionally and in the ordinary course of business permitted the overdraft.\u00a0 All the facts are inconsistent with such a claim, and the evidence fails to justify the conclusion that the bank or its proper authorities ever intended to permit Lim Buanco to overdraw his account.\u00a0 It is somewhat difficult to understand why these irregularities, which extended over many months, were not previously discovered, but the failure earlier to discover the fraud does not deprive the acts of the defendants of criminality.<br\/><br\/>The defendants contend that the crime charged in the information is conspiracy, and not <i>estafa<\/i>.\u00a0 As we read the complaint and consider the evidence, the conspiracy referred to therein means no more than an agreement or understanding between the parties that they should work together to accomplish a fraudulent purpose.\u00a0 The crime of conspiracy as known to the common law does not exist under the system embodied in the Penal Code.\u00a0 Under the common law, a combination of two or more persons to do an unlawful act by lawful means, or a lawful act by unlawful means, to the prejudice of an individual or the public, is a distinct offense.\u00a0 The Penal Code defines certain acts as conspiracies and makes them punishable, and the statutes of the Philippine Islands have created certain crimes which are denominated conspiracies.\u00a0 'Article 4 of the Penal Code says that there is a conspiracy when two or more persons act together for the commission of a crime, and decide to commit it, but it also provides that a conspiracy or proposition to commit a crime is punishable only in the cases in which the law specifically makes them so.\u00a0 A penalty for such conspiracies is provided in but a few instances.\u00a0 Article 137 provides that conspiracies to commit any of the crimes mentioned in the three preceding articles, which relate to the crime of treason, shall be punishable with the penalty of <i>presidio mayor<\/i>.\u00a0 Article 157 imposes the penalty of reclusidn perpetua to death upon any person who shall kill the king, and article 158 provides that a conspiracy to commit such a crime shall be punished with <i>reclusion temporal<\/i>.\u00a0 Article 164 provides that a conspiracy to kill the immediate successor to the crown, or the regent of the kingdom, shall be punished with the penalty of <i>prision mayor<\/i> in its medium and maximum degrees.\u00a0 Article 235 provides that conspiracies to commit the crime of rebellion shall be punished with the penalty of <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its medium and maximum degrees, and article 240 provides that a conspiracy to commit the crime of sedition shall be punished with the penalty of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> or <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum degree.\u00a0 These are the only conspiracies which are made punishable by the Penal Code.\u00a0 (See 3 Alcubilla, 281.)\u00a0 Sections 4, 7, and 8 of Act No. 292, and section 1 of Act No. 1692, declare that certain specified acts shall constitute criminal conspiracies, and provide for their punishment, but the legislature has not yet deemed it advisable to adopt the general common law of conspiracy.\u00a0 It thus appears that when two or more persons act together for the commission of a crime, and proceed to\u00a0 commit the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>, the act is not a criminal conspiracy under the Penal Code, because no penalty has been provided therefor nor is it within the provisions of Acts Nos. 292 or 1692.\u00a0 No crime of conspiracy is attempted to be charged against the defendants by this information.\u00a0 They are charged with the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>, committed in the manner described in the information, and upon the evidence they were properly\u00a0 convicted of that crime.<br\/><br\/>The judgment and sentence of the trial court should be and are therefore affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The court erred in refusing the admission of the document, Exhibit A, as a public instrument.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The court erred in refusing the admission of the stubbooks and the duplicate of the affidavit, Exhibits B and C, on account of the mere fact that these documents say Banonong and the complaint says Sulango.n.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The court erred in rendering its decision on the ground that there was no evidence of the fact that Timoteo Carreon was the owner of this land at the time he sold it to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>\"4. The court erred in resting its decision on the allegation that, in an action for eviction, the plaintiff must not base his claim upon the insufficiency of the title of the defendant but on the validity of his own title.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>During the trial of the cause it was clearly proved that the plaintiff had been in the possession of the land in question at least from on or about the 3d day of September, 1896 to 1903 or 1904, and that on or about the latter date the defendant had forcibly taken possession of the same.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff attempted to show that upon the 3d day of September, 1896, he had purchased the land in question from one Timoteo Carreon and had actually delivered to the said vendor a carabao and some rice in payment therefor.\u00a0 To support this claim the plaintiff offered in evidence a certified copy of a deed or conveyance of the said land, executed and delivered by the said Carreon before the justice of the peace of the pueblo of Dapitan (Exhibit A).\u00a0 The defendant objected to the admission of this document in evidence upon the ground that the same had not been duly identified.\u00a0 The lower court sustained the objection.\u00a0 The appellant assigns this ruling as one of the errors committed by the lower court.\u00a0 To demonstrate that the lower court committed an error in rejecting this document, the appellant in this court cites articles 3 and 9 of the <i>Real Decreto del Rey de Espa\u00f1a de 29 de Mayo, 1885<\/i>. (See Appendix (<i>a<\/i>), p. 210, Code of Civil Procedure, old code.)<br\/><br\/>Article 3 of said decree is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Justices of the peace, and, in their absence, the <i>gobernadorcillos<\/i>, shall perform the duties of such offices before a <i>testigo de asistencia<\/i> of legal age, who is in the enjoyment of all his civil rights and who can read and write correctly.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Article 9 of said decree is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"In the places where no <i>escribanos reales<\/i> or notaries public may exist, and it is impracticable to appoint ad interim officials, as provided in the preceding article, they shall be substituted in the exercise of the judicial authority by <i>testigos de asistencia<\/i>, in accordance witli the laws and provisions now in force.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The contention of the defendant is that article 9 of said decree permits a justice of the peace, assisted by witnesses, to perform the duties of a notary public when there are no notaries public or clerks of courts in the district.\u00a0 A careful reading of said decree, however, will show clearly that this contention of the appellant is not tenable.\u00a0 Articles 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of said decree relate to justices of the peace and their duties, together with the <i>gobernadorcillos<\/i>, in relation to the duties of the judges of the Courts of First Instance, during the absence or inability of said judge.<br\/><br\/>Articles 6, 7, 8 and 9 of said decree relate to the clerks of the Courts of First Instance and notaries public and persons who may be substituted for them in their absence and before others are appointed.\u00a0 The phrase, therefore, \"they shall be substituted in the exercise of the judicial authority\" has no relation whatever to the substitution of a justice of the peace in the place of a notary public or of a clerk of the Court of First Instance, but refers to the substitution of witnesses of assistance for notaries public and clerks of Courts of First Instance during the absence of the latter and before the appointment of other notaries public and clerks of the courts.<br\/><br\/>Courts of justices of the peace are courts of special and limited jurisdiction and have no authority except that expressly imposed by law.\u00a0 Upon this question the juris- prudence of Spain and of the United States is the same.\u00a0 Justices of the peace were not expressly authorized by law to take the acknowledgment of documents of this class.\u00a0 The mere fact that the said justice did take the acknowledgment of the document in question did not have the effect of making it a public document.\u00a0 Therefore article 1216 of the Civil Code does not apply to it.\u00a0 The fact remains, however, that the said document was actually made and signed by the parties to it, and it was recorded in the records of the justice of the peace and is, therefore, a private document, and as such is binding upon the parties.\u00a0 It should have been admitted in evidence for the purpose of showing the rights and relations of the parties under and by virtue of its terms.<br\/><br\/>Section 299 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides that <i>public records kept in the Philippine Islands of private writing are public writings<\/i>, and that a copy of the same, duly certified to be true, should be admissible in evidence the same as the original writing.\u00a0 In the present case the copy offered in evidence by the plaintiff was certified to be a true copy of the record of the justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>The defendant admitted during the trial that the plaintiff had a document executed and delivered by the said Timoteo Carreon, representing the sale of the land in question, but alleged that the document was a deed of sale executed and delivered by Timoteo Carreon to his father.\u00a0 The defendant claims that his father Carlos Elumbaring, had purchased the land in question from Timoteo Carreon, but admitted that he had no written evidence of that fact.\u00a0 This contention of the defendant is not only discredited by the document which the plaintiff offered in evidence, but also by the fact that Carlos Elumbaring permitted the plaintiff to occupy the land in question and to pay the taxes upon the same, from September, 1896, until the time of his death in 1903, without objection, so far as the record shows.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff contends that the lower court committed an error in not admitting the tax receipts which he offered in evidence.\u00a0 Tax receipts are no evidence of the right of ownership nor of the right of possession of land.<br\/><br\/>The payment of taxes on property does not alone constitute sufficient evidence of title.\u00a0 (Casimiro <i>vs<\/i>. Fernandez, 9 Phil. Rep., 562.)<br\/><br\/>Tax receipts are no evidence of title to land unsupported by other proper proof.\u00a0 (Evangelista <i>vs<\/i>. Tabayuyong, 7 Phil. Rep., 607.)<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff during the trial offered in evidence the declaration of ownership made for the purpose of taxation and presented it to the assessing authorities of the pueblo of Dapitan.\u00a0 This declaration was also rejected by the lower court and was not admitted in evidence.\u00a0 It appears that by virtue of this declaration the land in question was entered upon the municipal tax books as the land of the plaintiff. Said declaration, however, can in no way serve for the purpose of proving that the plaintiff was the owner of the land; nevertheless, in view of the fact that the plaintiff had a deed of purchase of said land executed and delivered to him by the former owner, Timoteo Carreon, the tax receipts and said declaration constitute some proof, showing the good faith of the plaintiff in occupying and retaining the possession of the land in question.<br\/><br\/>The said contract between Timoteo Carreon and the plaintiff, even as a private document, is effective between them and is good as to a third person not having better evidence of title to said land.\u00a0 (Fabian <i>vs<\/i>. Smith, Bell &amp; Co., 8 Phil. Rep., 496; Boncan <i>vs<\/i>. Smith, Bell &amp; Co., 9 Phil. Rep., 109.)<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, in an action of ejectment to recover the possession of land, claiming to be the owner thereof, can not recover such possession on the theory that the one in possession has no title to the land.\u00a0 His right to recovery depends upon his own title rather than the weakness of the title of the plaintiff.\u00a0 (Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos <i>vs<\/i>. Topi\u00f1io, 4 Phil. Rep., 33.)<br\/><br\/>Without passing upon the question of the ownership of the plaintiff and confining our decision to the mere question of his right of possession of said land as against the defendant, we are of the opinion and so hold:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the plaintiff had been in the quiet, peaceable and uninterrupted enjoyment of the possession of the land in question, under and by virtue of the contract of sale between himself and Timoteo Carreon from the 3d of September, 1896, up to the time when he wais dispossessed by the defendant, probably in the month of August, 1904.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That the defendant showed no evidence of his right to possess the land further than his actual, manual possession of the same.\u00a0 Under these facts had the action been brought within the period of one year in the court of the justice of the peace, the plaintiff would clearly be entitled to the recovery of the possession of the land in question.\u00a0 The period of prescription fixed by law not having yet expired, certainly the plaintiff could not lose his right to recover the possession of the land for the simple reason that he did not bring his action in the court of the justice of the peace within a year after he had actually been forcible ejected by intimidation or fraud from the land.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff in his complaint in the court below laid a proper foundation for the claim of damages against the defendant, but failed during the trial to present evidence sufficient upon which a judgment for damages could be based.\u00a0 Therefore we make no finding as to the claim for damages made by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above stated we are of the opinion and so hold that the judgment of the lower court should be reversed and that judgment should be entered declaring that the plaintiff is entitled to the immediate possession of the land in question, and that a writ of possession should be issued for the purpose of putting the plaintiff into possession of said property.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres Mapa, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Tracey, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Willard, J<\/i>., concurs in the result.<\/div>",

(2) that the defendants are Aniceta Fontanosa, as widow of Roberto Ancajas, and Florentina, Leona, Maria, Juan, Romualdo, Vicenta, and Felix, all of the surname of Ancajas, the lawful children of the deceased Roberto, and Estefania Fontanosa, mother and legal guardian of the minor Jose Ancajas; (3) that at the death of Gavino Veloso, Roberto Ancajas owed him the sum of 5,065 pesos which he had borrowed prior to the year 1881; (4) that in the apportionment of the estate, this debt of 5,065 pesos went to Buenaventura Veloso as his portion; (5) that in the year 1882, Roberto Ancajas, after having acknowledged the transfer of his indebtedness by inheritance to Buenaventura Veloso, continued to receive sums of money from the latter on the same conditions, that is, as loans, and bound himself to make annual payments in sugar; (6) that on the 11th of October, 1883, the debt of Roberto Ancajas amounted to 10,449.18 pesos, as shown by a liquidation of accounts made between them and ratified by Roberto Ancajas in the said month of October, 1883; (7) that on August 4, 1884, this balance amounted to 12,199.65 pesos; (8) that oh May 31, 1887, it rose to 14,439.40 pesos, which sum, however, was reduced to 12,365.20 pesos by the payment of 2,074.20 pesos on account; (9) that up to the year 1893 the defendants made payments amounting to 642.27 pesos which reduced the amount owing to 11,722.43 pesos; (10) that on the death of Buenaventura Veloso, the defendants, as his sole and lawful heirs, inherited, and that same year divided between them all his property with the exception of the above-mentioned credit, which is at present held <i>pro indiviso<\/i> between them, and they, as the lawful heirs of Buenaventura Veloso, the creditor, have repeatedly called upon the defendants to pay the said credit, but the latter have constantly refused to do so, thus giving rise to the filing of the complaint; (11) that on account of their delinquency in payment they have caused the plaintiffs damages to the value of 14,068.48 pesos; they therefore asked the court below to sentence the defendants to pay both sums, with legal interest thereon from the time they ceased to make payments, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>That the attorneys who answered the complaint, subscribed their answer:\u00a0 \"Attorneys for Aniceta Fontanesa, Maria, Juana, Romualda, Vicenta, and Felix, all surnamed Ancajas, and for Estefania Fontanosa, having previously signed the receipt for the complaint in this manner:\u00a0 \"Attorneys for the defendants, with the exception of Florentina and Leona Ancajas.\"<br\/><br\/>That in the answer, in addition to the general denial of all the allegations in the complaint, there was put forward as special defense: (1) That this supposed right of action had prescribed before the action was instituted; (2) that Romualda Ancajas and some of the other general heirs of Roberto Ancajas were not of age, at the time of the death of Roberto Ancajas, nor at the time of the supposed acceptance of the inheritance, and that there was no judicial intervention in said acceptance.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge in his findings of fact considers that, among other allegations of the complaint, the\u00a0 following have been proven:<br\/><blockquote>'That Aniceta Ancajas is the wife of the said deceased and that with the exception of the minor Jose Ancajas, who is represented in these proceedings by his legal guardian, Estefania Fontanosa, and is the grandchild of the said deceased Roberto Ancajas, most of the defendants are his children; that as heirs the said defendants took possession of all the property of the said deceased after his death, and at the present time are in possession as the undivided owners thereof.\"\u00a0 (B. of E., 12.) <\/blockquote> And as conclusions of law he says;<br\/><blockquote>\"That the defendants being the heirs of Roberto Ancajas, deceased, and having taken possession of the latter's property from the time of his death to the present time, as heirs of the said deceased, and exercising over the same all those acts which show ownership, which, if they were not the heirs, they could not have exercised, they have purely and simply accepted the inheritance from their\u00a0 principal, and consequently, under, article 1003 of the Civil Code, they are liable for the encumbrances with which the heritage is charged, not only with the property of their principal but also with their own; that the defendants, as heirs of the late Roberto Ancajas, having acknowledged and admitted the latter's debt to Buenaventura Veloso, the principal of the plaintiffs, which acknowledgment was made expressly and by means of the payments made by them to the creditor, have contracted the express obligation to pay it under the same terms as their aforesaid principal; that the defendants are liable for the payment of the sum of Pl1,722.43 to the plaintiffs, in their capacity of heirs, to Buenaventura Veloso, for the debt contracted in his favor by their late principal Roberto Ancajas, and which debt was acknowledged and admitted by them; that as the defendants have acknowledged and admitted the said debt, toward the settlement of which they made the last payment in the year 1893, the right of action for its recovery, by article 1964 of the Civil Code, and in accordance with article 943 of the Code of Commerce, prescribes after the lapse of fifteen years, and inasmuch as the period of fifteen years from said date until the time the complaint herein was presented, has not expired, the conclusion is that the said action is enforceable and should be made effective; that, it being proven that Buenaventura Veloso, the plaintiffs principal, had brought suit against the defendants in the year 1896 for the payment of said debt, it must be concluded that the prescription of the action for recovery has been legally interrupted, in conformity with the provisions of article 1973 of the Civil Code; that the debt of P11,722.43 is a credit which originated from a mercantile contract, and as the interest due the plaintiffs can not be determined, they are entitled to recover the legal interest on said amount from the defendants at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the month of September, 1893, until the full payment thereof.\" <\/blockquote> The defendants appealed from this judgment of the lower court, alleging the following errors:<br\/><ol> <li>The admission of the books marked as Exhibits A, B, and C as evidence, and the overruling of the motion for their exclusion.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The admission of Exhibits D, E, F, and G as evidence.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The finding that the defendants are the heirs of the late Roberto Ancajas, and that they purely and simply accepted the inheritance from the said deceased.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The overruling of the motion for a new trial.<br\/><\/li><\/ol>With regard to the first and second errors, charged against the admission of the documentary evidence of the appellees, the rulings of the court below are in accordance with the law.\u00a0 The books marked as Exhibits A\u00a0 and B simply serve to show the origin and progress of the debt, and they may be ignored from the moment there was entered on folio 88 of the book marked Exhibit C a debit and credit account, of which Exhibit E is an exact copy, and which shows the account maintained between Buenaventura Veloso and Roberto Ancajas as accepted by the latter and signed by him in proof of his conformity with the balance of P10,449.18 appearing therein.\u00a0 This acknowledgment by their principal must be decisive as to the heirs, and it must be held to be proven that at least they are indebted in said sum of P10,449.18, since against the admission and validity of Exhibit E nothing has been alleged by the appellants in this instance.<br\/><br\/>As the successive liquidations which the trial court took into consideration until reaching the one at bar are not specifically impugned, either in this instance or in the court below, they are not now, therefore, subject to revision by this court.<br\/><br\/>As to the prescription of the right of action which is subsidiarily alleged in order to impugn the obligation which, according to the judgment appealed from still exists, the appellants say that \"the debt had prescribed so far as the defendants are concerned, with the questionable\u00a0 exception of the defendant Aniceta Fontanosa, widow of Roberto Ancajas, because it appears that said Aniceta Fontanosa was the only person who made any payment, and it is not possible that an act performed by one of the defendants can prejudice the legal rights of the others.\"\u00a0 (Brief, 5.)<br\/><br\/>The court below considered as proven:\u00a0 (1) The payments made by the heirs after the death of Roberto Ancajas, the last of which was in 1893; (2) a judicial complaint filed against these same defendants in 1896.\u00a0 From these facts the court below makes the following deductions:\u00a0 First, that the right of action that existed in 189S to demand the settlement of the debt which, by article 1964 of the Civil Code should prescribe at the expiration of fifteen years, had not prescribed in 1906, the time of filing the present complaint.\u00a0 Second, that in consequence of the filing of the said complaint in 1896, the running of the statute was interrupted, as prescribed by article 1978 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>It has been proven that on the 11th of October, 1883, Roberto Ancajas acknowledged that a balance of 10,449.18 pesos was standing against him; that since that time he has received and paid amounts in connection with said obligation, the last payment being made shortly before his death in 1888,\" as stated by the appellants in their brief on page 5, that is, on May 5, 1888, as appears at folio 223 of the book offered in evidence by the appellees as Exhibit C.\u00a0 It therefore follows that in computing the time for prescription from said date it would be necessary to take into consideration the fact that the Civil Code was not yet in force, as it did not become effective until December 8, 1889, and that, at that time, the period for the prescription of personal actions, such as the one at issue, by law 5, title 8, book 11, of the <i>Novisima\u00a0 Recopilacion<\/i>, was twenty years, which period should expire in 1908 that when the complaint herein was presented in 1906, the term had not expired; therefore, we have not to\u00a0 consider the legal interruption of a term which has not yet expired, as in the present case the question is one of a period of prescription that commenced before the enforcement of the Civil Code, which period, by the terms of article 1939 of the said code, must be governed by the laws then in force.<br\/><br\/>The Civil Code would only be applicable, if the whole period required thereby for prescription had transpired after it was put in force, notwithstanding the fact that, under the old laws, a longer lapse of time was necessary (art. 1939, Civil Code).\u00a0 And since the 8th of December, 1889, when the Civil Code went into effect, the fifteen years required by the provisions thereof for the prescription of the right of personal actions have certainly elapsed.\u00a0 But in the present case the court below has considered two forms of interruption of the prescription of the right, namely, the exercise thereof before the courts, and the act of the acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor.\u00a0 The said court found that payments were made in the years 1891, 1892, and 1893 by the widow of the late Roberto Ancajas, and the period for the prescription must be counted from the last-mentioned date, because the action could only have been exercised thereafter.\u00a0 It is evident that since then the term required by article 1964 of the Civil Code has not expired, and supposing that such payments had not been made, the court below considered as proven that in 1896, an action was brought for the recovery of this debt, and against this consideration\u00a0 no error of law or fact has been assigned.\u00a0 No judgment was rendered by reason of the revolution that took place in 1898, and the record of the case was lost through the same cause; facts which were agreed to between the contending parties at this trial.\u00a0 And in conformity with the decision of the supreme court of Spain of July 5, 1904, which interprets the right sense of the aforesaid article 1973, the action then instituted and that now brought are one and the same.<br\/><br\/>Against the finding of the court below as to the first method of interruption of the prescription, in so far as it considered that the payments made after the death of Roberto Ancajas by his widow, Aniceta Fontanosa, were an acknowledgment of the debt, the appellants allege \"that an act performed by one of the defendants can not prejudice the legal rights of the others.\"\u00a0 But, in accordance with article 1974, interruption of prescription of rights of action in all kind of obligations of the heirs of the debtor, benefits or prejudices them all alike, inasmuch as each and all of them represent the principal, and they jointly succeed him in his rights and obligations.<br\/><br\/>For all the above reasons the judgment entered by the trial court \"That payment shall be made to the plaintiffs of the sum of Pll,722.43 with costs,\" is proper, for the reason that it is in accordance with the law and the merits of the case.<br\/><br\/>But that the above-stated amount shall be in Philippine pesos \" (p11,722.43),\" as determined in the judgment, is not in accordance with the law or the merits.\u00a0 Even the latest sum loaned on the 31st of May, 1887, according to the last liquidation considered in,point 8 of the complaint, was that current at the time, and certainly the unit was not then the Philippine peso.<br\/><br\/>Neither is the sentence contained in the judgment appealed from, that \"the legal interest on the said sum at the rate of 6 per cent per annum shall be payable from the month of September, 1893,\" in accordance with the law.\u00a0 It is proper to sentence the defendants to pay the legal interest of 6 per cent per annum by reason of the default incurred by the heirs of Ancajas (art. 1108, Civil Code), but such default can not date back of September, 1893, that is, from the time of the last payment made by them or by Aniceta Fontanosa.\u00a0 Article 1100 of the Civil Code\u00a0 reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Persons obliged * * * are in default from the moment when the creditor demands the fulfillment of their obligation, judicially or extrajudicially,\"<br\/><\/blockquote>And the judicial demand for the fulfillment of said obligation was only made in 1896; hence, as the date of the complaint\u00a0 interposed in that year has not been fixed, the net amount claimed therein should only commence to bear legal interest from the latter part of 1896, or rather from the beginning of 1897.\u00a0 In a decision of December 3, 1902, the supreme court of Spain held:<br\/><blockquote>\"That it is a principle\u00a0 of law, acknowledged and sanctioned by article 1100, in relation to article 1108 of the Civil Code, that interest upon default only becomes due from the time of the judicial or extrajudicial notice by the creditor to the debtor, unless otherwise expressly provided by law, or by virtue of a contract, or on account of special circumstances depending upon the nature of the obligation.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>As to the third and fourth errors, it is true that, in view of the evidence submitted with the bill of exceptions, and because all the facts of the complaint have been generally denied by the defendants, the following facts, which are stated in the judgment as resulting from the record, have not been proven:<br\/><blockquote>\"That the other defendants, apart from the widow of Ancajas, are the children of the latter, and that Jose Ancajas is his grandchild, all of them being his only heirs; that Estefania Fontanosa is the legal guardian of the\u00a0 minor Jose Ancajas; that as such heirs they took possession of all the property of the deceased and hold the same <i>pro indiviso\"<\/i><br\/><\/blockquote>And as a natural consequence, there is no ground for the most important conclusion of law in the decision:<br\/><blockquote>\"That, inasmuch as they took possession of the property of the late Roberto Ancajas, and performed all those acts of ownership thereof which, without being heirs they could not have\u00a0 performed, they purely and simply accepted the inheritance from their principal, and have ever since become liable for his debt, not only with the property they received from him, but also with their own property.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Florentina Ancajas is the only person who appeared as the daughter of Roberto Ancajas and testified as a witness for the plaintiffs, but it does not appear that she, or another of the name of Leona (often called <i>Leon<\/i>), have ever been summoned and cited to appear or that they failed to answer the complaint.\u00a0 It is certain that they have not answered it.\u00a0 From the testimony of this witness it appears that it was Aniceta Fontanosa who, after the death of her husband, Roberto Ancajas, made the three last payments on account of the latter's debt.<br\/><br\/>Thus, it is not proper that a sentence, rightly entered against the heirs or successors of Roberto Ancajas, should particularly fall upon the persons named in the complaint, and to whom the judgment refers, for no other reason than that they were designated as such heirs in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth we hold that the net amount due to the plaintiffs by such persons as may turn out to be the lawful heirs of Roberto Ancajas, in addition to those who, apart from the minor Jose Ancajas, appeared in this suit, has been rightly determined, that is, the sum of 11,722.48 pesos, with legal interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent, from the time the suit was filed in 1896, with the costs of the first instance against the defendants who answered the complaint.\u00a0 The judgment appealed from is hereby set aside in order that a new trial may he held for the purpose of properly determining who are the heirs against whom should be directed the order of payment, and what were the acts and form of acceptance of the inheritance, and of the possession and method of possession of the property remaining at the death of Roberto Ancajas; after which let a new judgment be rendered which\u00a0 shall include a finding of the equivalent of the amount owing in Philippine currency at the time of such decision.\u00a0 No special ruling is made as to the costs in this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Hahn, situated in Calle D. Silang, in the town of Batangas, capital of the province of the same name.\u00a0 The said lady, as a teacher of the provincial high school, was teaching them to recite some selected pieces which they were preparing for a performance that was to take place at the school on Friday of that week.<br\/><br\/>Miss Hahn was about 50 years of age, and had been engaged in teaching in these Islands since 1901;\u00a0 she lived alone, in a house with a nipa roof, erected on the same lot as the provincial high school building, and located within a short distance of the same.\u00a0 She was reputed among the persons who were acquainted with her as being possessed of considerable means.\u00a0 In the said house in which she resided, and which consisted of several rooms, was also located the school wherein she taught domestic science.<br\/><br\/>On the following morning, Wednesday, the 29th, Miss Hahn did not attend school at the usual hour and some of her pupils went to her house in search of her.\u00a0 They did not enter the house, but called to her from the outside.\u00a0 They immediately\u00a0 returned somewhat alarmed, and informed the principal teacher, Mr. Small, that the said lady had not responded to their calls.\u00a0 At this the said principal, accompanied by another teacher, Mr. Gregg, at once went to the above-mentioned house, where they found Miss Hahn lying dead in her bedroom, the body stretched partly on the floor and partly on a canvas bed.\u00a0 The face was covered with blood and they found blood stains on the partition wall alongside.\u00a0 The deceased was dressed, her shoes were on her feet, and her clothes slightly disarranged but in almost normal condition.\u00a0 The bed did not seem to have been occupied by its owner.\u00a0 There was a hand lamp with a broken chimney on the table of the bedroom, and on the table of the <i>sala<\/i> (reception or sitting room) there lay an open book, face downward.\u00a0 There was no lamp on this table but near by hung the frame of a hanging lamp.\u00a0 In an open trunk there were found some clothes belonging to the deceased, a gold watch and a ten-peso note.\u00a0 It should be noted that the entrance\u00a0 door of the house connected directly with the <i>sala<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The municipal physician, Gregorio Limjoco, and the Army surgeon, Frederick Jenkins, visited the said house on the same date, the 29th, and examined the body of the deceased.\u00a0 They found seventeen wounds upon it, some of which were mortal.\u00a0 Fifteen of the wounds were upon the head; the skull had been fractured by blows on the forehead, on the left side, and on the back of the head.\u00a0 A wound was discovered on the neck and another on the right side below the ribs, both apparently inflicted with the edge of a cutting and stabbing instrument.\u00a0 As these\u00a0 wounds had not bled, it would appear that they were inflicted after the victim was dead.\u00a0 The injuries on the head had been produced by an instrument similar to a club, and from the appearance of the parallel edges of the wounds, it is inferred that the instrument used was similar to a large file or some grooved instrument.\u00a0 It should further be noted that to the south of the house of the deceased there was a cornfield, cultivated by Lucio Aldea, and separated from the house by a fence.\u00a0 On the morning of Thursday, the 30th of January, two policemen engaged in investigating clues found in this field, at a distance of about 15 feet from this fence, a small new trunk, containing clothing and some letters addressed to the deceased.\u00a0 The trunk was open and upon the cover there were some blood stains in parallel lines similar to those which might be produced by a grooved or channelled bar sliding across the surface.\u00a0 Various articles for ladies' use that apparently had been taken from the trunk were strewn upon the ground.\u00a0 An iron bar about 14 inches long and five-eights of an inch thick was also found on March 14, near the fence of the said cornfield at a distance of about 10 or 12 feet, at a point where the fence was apparently broken and near the spot where the trunk was found.\u00a0 At one end of this bar was wound a spiral thread and a piece of cloth was wrapped around the other, apparently to form a handle.<br\/><br\/>From the whole of the evidence adduced in the case it would appear that the events which occurred in the house of Miss Hahn took place in the following manner:\u00a0 After 8 o'clock of\u00a0 the evening of Tuesday, the 28th of January, Macario Balangui, a cook in the service of the principal teacher, Mr. Small, left the latter's house after supper to return home, although with the intention of calling while on his way on Pablo Berba, his friend and patron; but on reaching the junction of Calles Aguinaldo and D. Silang, he met Eusebio Burias, who invited him to accompany him to the house of Miss Hahn, whom he was going to ask to lend him some money.\u00a0 Balangui acceded to this request in order to please Burias, and on asking the latter what it was that he carried concealed on his back beneath his shirt, was told that it was a stick.\u00a0 On arriving in front of the above-mentioned house Burias told Balangui to wait for him, and then went toward the south and the fence that separated the cornfield from Miss Hahn's yard.\u00a0 When Burias arrived there he called out to some one and a few minutes later a man appeared who, on being asked who he was\u00a0 replied that he was Lucio Aldea, the owner of the said cornfield on the south of Miss Hahn's house.\u00a0 After a short conversation Eusebio Burias and Lucio Aldea said that they would enter the teacher's house, Burias telling Balangui to stand in front thereof and warning him not to tell anybody that they were inside.\u00a0 The door of the house stood open and\u00a0 when they had passed through, Eusebio entering first, followed by Lucio, Balangui took up a position to the north in the dark.\u00a0 From this point he heard Eusebio's voice asking Miss Hahn in English to lend him some money, and the latter's voice refusing.\u00a0 Immediately afterwards he heard a sound as of a human body falling to the floor.\u00a0 Believing that it was Miss Hahn's body he ran toward the street, and then he heard a cry of \"no-o, Sebio.\"\u00a0 He there upon sat down, but as he could not keep still, he again approached the house to a distance of about 3 <i>brazas<\/i> (6 yards) from the steps to see what had been done.\u00a0 At this moment he heard the words \"Hurry up or people will catch us,\" and immediately afterwards Eusebio and Lucio came out of the house carrying a trunk, on the top of which was a stick; this they took to the south side of the house.\u00a0 After seeing this Balangui went to Nicanor Berba's store, which was still open.\u00a0 In a short time he saw Eusebio hurrying from the scene of the crime.\u00a0 Balangui went to meet him and asked whether he had obtained the money from the teacher, Eusebio replied in the negative, and on being asked why, he answered that they had killed her.\u00a0 When questioned as to why they had killed her Eusebio replied:\u00a0 \"Because she knew me, and she might have given information against me.\"\u00a0 Balangui then went to Pablo Berba's house, where he sat down upon a bench.\u00a0 Shortly afterwards Eusebio Burias appeared, and at the latter's invitation Balangui accompanied him to the circus.\u00a0 On their way, at Burias' request Balangui bought a piece of cake (<i>un pionono<\/i>) for 2 cehtavos, which was the only money he had.\u00a0 Eusebio ate the cake, and on reaching the circus they separated, and he did not see Burias again until he was captured.<br\/><br\/>By virtue of the foregoing, on March 26,1908, an information was filed by the provincial fiscal in the Court of First Instance of Batangas, charging Eusebio Burias, Lucio Aldea, and Macario Balangui with the crime of robbery with homicide, and the corresponding proceedings having been instituted, the judge on the 31st of the said month rendered judgment sentencing Eusebio Burias and Lucio Aldea to be hanged by the neck until dead at the place fixed by law, and Macario Balangui to the penalty of fourteen years, eight months, and one day of <i>cadena temporal<\/i>, with the accessories, and all of them, jointly\u00a0 and severally, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased, Miss Anna E. Hahn, in the sum of P2,000 and to pay the costs in equal parts.\u00a0 The accused Burias and Aldea expressed their desire to appeal, but the lower court informed them that the judgment would be submitted for review on account of the death penalty imposed upon them.\u00a0 Macario Balangui\u00a0 appealed to this court, but a few days after the trial of the case in this second instance he filed a written request to withdraw his appeal as he was disposed to serve his sentence.\u00a0 This writing was ratified by him before a witness in the presence of the Director of Prisons.<br\/><br\/>The facts above-related, fully proven in this case, constitute the complex crime of robbery with homicide, prescribed and punished by articles 502 and 503, paragraph 1, of the\u00a0 Penal Code, inasmuch as it appears proven beyond peradventure of doubt that between the hours of 8.30 and 9.30 of the said night, the house of the unfortunate Miss Anna E. Hahn, who lived alone therein, was entered by two persons armed with a stick and an iron bar, accompanied by another who remained near by on the premises, for the purpose of robbing the same; that to that end they assaulted their victim with the said stick and iron bar, inflicting fifteen wounds on her face and head, one on her neck, and another on her right side; that some of the wounds on the head were mortal, the blows fracturing the skull, in consequence of which she died instantly; that on leaving the house the robbers took with them a traveling trunk that contained clothes and other articles belonging to the deceased, and which trunk, together with its contents was found on the morning of the third day in an adjoining cornfield, and, on the 14th of March following, the iron bar with which the crime was committed was found a short distance from the place where the trunk had been found in the same field.<br\/><br\/>It is indisputable that the said crime, which was duly qualified as robbery with homicide, was committed, since the unfortunate victim of the atrocious act was living and in good health until about 8 o'clock on the evening of Tuesday, January 28, at which time several of her pupils who had been there to receive their lessons left her at the house.\u00a0 On the following day she was found dead, her body showing seventeen wounds.\u00a0 Therefore there is no doubt that she lost her life in a violent manner, and not as the consequence of some disease.\u00a0 From the fact that a book was found open and lying face downward on the table it is indubitable that the deceased was reading when the robbers entered the <i>sala<\/i> and she placed the book on the table on rising from her chair to receive them.\u00a0 The hand lamp which probably furnished light for her reading must have been taken to the bedroom by one of the aggressors before or after assaulting her and placed on the table where it was found, for their use in committing the robbery, which was the final object of the malefactors.\u00a0 The cause furnishes no evidence that they had put her to death for any motive other than that which led them to the said house, therefore it is undeniable that they killed her in order to rob her with safety to themselves and without any hindrance.\u00a0 In fact this was so said by Eusebio Burias to Macario Balangui; that is, that they killed Miss Hahn because she recognized him in the act of the assault.<br\/><br\/>It was also clearly proven in the case that the crime of robbery was committed.\u00a0 The finding of a trunk containing clothes, letters addressed to the victim, and other articles belonging to her, by the local authorities and their agents in the cornfield contiguous to the scene of the crime on the third day after its execution, proves in an incontrovertible manner the commission of said crime, so that it can not be denied that the complex crime of robbery with homicide was committed.<br\/><br\/>No one witnessed the execution of the crime except the principals thereof, but by the revelations of Macario Balangui, who remained on the premises, it is possible in a way to reconstitute the acts of which the unfortunate teacher, Miss Hahn, was the victim, at least from the time the robbers entered the house up to the moment they left it carrying, with them the trunk with the iron bar on top.\u00a0 In order to fix and determine what share the accused Burias and Aldea took in said crime it is therefore necessary to look to the testimony of Macario Balangui and the other data and merits of the case.<br\/><br\/>The judge who tried the case and made the findings of fact, held that the participation and responsibility of Macario Balangui was that of an accomplice, who, with knowledge of the commission of the crime, cpdperated in its execution by acts previous to and during its commission, thought not as principal.\u00a0 Macario Balangui, in relating what occurred in his presence before and after the death of Miss Hahn, and in incriminating his codefendants Burias and Aldea, neither denied nor excused, but indeed confessed the part taken by him, and which the court below qualified as cooperation in the crime, so there is no lawful reason why these confessions and incriminations against his coaccused should not be taken into account.\u00a0 Only those confessions and incriminations made by a coprincipal or accomplice who absolutely denies the charge and the facts alleged by the prosecution, and to excuse himself attributes to another person the execution of the crime should be rejected.\u00a0 The testimony of Macario Balangui is the more admissible and worthy of credit inasmuch as it is corroborated by circumstantial evidence and by certain statements of Eusebio Burias, and because it was neither denied nor proved to be false during the trial.<br\/><br\/>The two accused, Eusebio Burias and Lucio Aldea, denied the charge\u00a0 and pleaded not guilty, but in spite of their respective allegations in their defense, the case furnishes against them the incriminating testimony of Macario Balangui, which, coupled with a great deal of circumstantial evidence, proves in a satisfactory manner the guilt of said accused as the only principals by direct participation, fully convicted, of the complex crime of robbery with homicide.<br\/><br\/>A few days prior to the commission of the crime, Eusebio Burias left the service of the teachers Mr. Gregg and Mr. Scheer, and it is not true that he afterwards entered the service of Captain Parsons.\u00a0 He was then without occupation and means of living, and though he lacked the money with which to purchase the necessaries of life he proposed to resort to gambling.\u00a0 He attempted to buy four gamecocks from Angel Borbon on credit, but Borbon's wife would not consent to his taking them without having first paid the price.\u00a0 Two days prior to the occurrence, in the presence of Valeriano Delgado, he requested a person in the cockpit to loan him some money which he promised to repay on the next day when he would get some, he said, from an American teacher who had commissioned him to look for a servant for her.\u00a0 On the afternoon and night of the date of the crime said Burias was walking around the streets near the house of his victim, seeing her in the store of a Chinaman he stopped to watch her.\u00a0 While in that position he was seen by a cavalry sergeant named William Bigger who, upon hearing of the crime, spoke of it to another person and testified to the fact in court in the presence of the accused.\u00a0 The latter in turn could not state with precision where he was from haft past eight to ten o'clock of the said night of Tuesday, January 28, although in his testimony he says that he was in the vicinity of the place mentioned, and while Balangui related the facts under oath in the presence of the accused Burias, the latter heard\u00a0 impassively and without protest the statements and revelations of Balangui attributing to him the principal part in the commission of the crime herein prosecuted.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, the defendant Burias that night was dressed in khaki, and was seen by the policeman Macatangay, who was on duty after 8 o'clock at the corner of the streets P. Burgos and Aguinaldo, walking toward the place where the house of the victim is located.\u00a0\u00a0 When brought before the municipal president on the afternoon of the 29th, spots of blood were discovered on his khaki shirt and trousers as well as on his khaki coat which was taken from his house; he alleged that the blood was that of a cock belonging to Jose Espino which he had in his possession, but the latter denied having seen him in the cockpit on Sunday the 26th.<br\/><br\/>It should further be borne in mind that the deceased lived alone in her house, and that the accused Burias, who by the testimony of\u00a0 Mr. Gregg understands English very well, became acquainted with Miss Hahn's means and resources through the conversations of Messrs. Gregg and Scheer at meal times.\u00a0 It is not to be wondered at that the accused, in view of his needy condition and lack of money, should have contemplated securing it from Miss Hahn either with her consent or by force.\u00a0 Obtain it he did, and deprived her of her life.<br\/><br\/>The third letter, written in prison by Eusebio Burias, on March 6, 1908, and addressed to John Nelson, a policeman, in the main undoubtedly relates the real facts as they occurred.\u00a0 With the exception of the name of a man called Balar, and other\u00a0 particulars invented by its author, the letter substantially agrees with the testimony of Macario Balangui.\u00a0 Certain statements contained in the letter, as for example that they found the deceased reading a book in the <i>sala<\/i>; that after asking them what they wanted she ran toward the bedroom\u00a0 wherein she attempted to confine herself; that she was struck on the head with a wooden stick and an iron bar; that she fell down inside the said room, and that a trunk was taken out of the house-all these and other Retails specified in the letter produced\u00a0 at the trial appear to be fully confirmed by the evidence in1 the case as above set out.\u00a0 The allegation made by the accused that the letter in question was dictated by the policemen can not therefore be considered as true because the said policemen denied it, and in effect they were not present at the commission of the crime of which Burias was undoubtedly one of the principals.\u00a0 Furthermore, the accused when questioned as to the crime by Mr. Buck, who went to the prison to investigate the case, told the latter to read the letter which he had written to Nelson because the facts were stated therein.<br\/><br\/>Against the other accused, Lucio Aldea, there is the declaration of Macario Balangui to the effect that before Burias entered the house he went toward the fence of the cornfield and called\u00a0 out to Aldea, who shortly aftewards appeared and made himself known to Balangui.\u00a0 There is also the statement of the said Burias in the aforesaid letter of March 6 to the effect that Lucio Aldea was one of those who perpetrated the crime and was the first to strike the deceased.<br\/><br\/>The stolen trunk and its contents were found in the cornfield in charge of the accused Aldea on Thursday morning, and Aldea, when asked by the municipal president in the presence of witnesses on the afternoon of the same day about the said articles, answered that, in effect, he had heard that the trunk had been found on the previous day, Wednesday, thereby giving his hearers to understand that he was aware that the trunk was in the field before it was actually discovered.\u00a0 Footprints similar to those of the accused Aldea were found in places where the earth was damp, leading from the spot where the trunk was found toward the house of the accused.<br\/><br\/>When this individual was arrested, blood stains were observed on his clothing, and on being questioned in regard to them he first said that they were caused by banana juice, but later declared that they proceeded from the blood of a cock whose comb he had cut on the 26th of that month.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the menaces and promises alleged by the accused Aldea and Burias to have been made by the policemen Nelson and Macatangay, the latter deny having made them, and the case offers not the slightest proof or indication to the contrary.<br\/><br\/>From all this circumstantial evidence derived from proven facts and which corroborates Balangui's testimony, which testimony has been confirmed in its essentials by the letter written by the accused Eusebio Burias, one is fully convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the guilt of the said Burias and Aldea as the proven principals of the complex crime in question, which is one of the four extremely grave crimes punished by the Penal Code in force with two indivisible penalties of <i>cadena perpetua<\/i> to death.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime in question the aggravating circumstances of subdivisions 9, 15, and 20 of article 10\u00a0 of the Penal Code must be considered, without any mitigating circumstance to counteract their effects.\u00a0 The robbers perpetrated the crime of robbery with homicide, taking advantage of the silence and darkness of the night; they committed it in the dwelling of the offended party, and they assaulted her simultaneously in order to render ineffective or weaken any defense, and to prevent flight on the part of the victim, and therefore by paragraph 1 of article 80 of said code, the penalty which should be imposed is the greater pf the two provided by said paragraph 1 of article 503.<br\/><br\/>By the foregoing\u00a0 it is shown that the errors assigned by counsel\u00a0 for defense as committed\u00a0 by\u00a0 the .court below are without any reason or foundation.<br\/><br\/>In regard to Macario Balangui, who was sentenced as an accomplice to the medium degree\u00a0 of <i>cadena temporal<\/i>, no action should be taken in this decision, as he has withdrawn his appeal and stated that he is\u00a0 disposed to serve the sentence imposed upon him.<br\/><br\/>Therefore by virtue of the foregoing considerations and those of the judgment of the lower court which are not inconsistent herewith, we should affirm, as we do hereby affirm said judgment, with one-third of the costs against each of the accused, provided however, that the execution of the death penalty imposed upon two of the accused shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Act No.\u00a0 1577 of the Philippine Commission, and that in case the death penalty should be remitted by pardon of the guilty parties,\u00a0 the latter shall suffer the accessory penalties provided for by article 53 of the Penal Code, unless they be expressly remitted in the pardon.<br\/><br\/>The appeal presented by Macario Balangui from the judgment of the court below will be considered as withdrawn, and the judge below, who will immediately be informed of this decision, shall proceed according to law to the end that said Balangui shall at once commence to serve his sentence.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and<i> Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

That at the time and place mentioned in the complaint herein Coa\u00a0 Sin and Lim Ping, Chinese persons, conducted a retail business and lived in a small frame building near the Intendencia Building within the Walled City of Manila; and at about 4 o'clock in the morning of said day while still dark, the said two persons, Coa Sin and Lim Ping, were murdered, their bodies being hacked, chopped, and cut up in a most brutal manner, from which they immediately died.\u00a0 All the drawers, shelves, boxes, and trunks used by the said two Chinaman in\u00a0 said store and building were searched, opened, and ransacked, and the contents thereof, including cigars, cigarettes, money, and merchandise, were then and there carried away, without the consent of anyone in authority.\u00a0 Up to this point in the case there is no controversy whatever.<br\/><br\/>2.

That the said three defendants, Gregorio Domingo, Segundo Orozco, and Rafael de la Cruz, since their arrest in this case, have voluntarily admitted their presence at and during the commission of said crime.<br\/><br\/>4. That said crime was committed during the darkness of the night, in order that the same might be more easily accomplished, and to avoid pursuit and discovery of the defendants participating therein; and that the act of surprising said two Chinamen and the use of bolos and sharp instruments to overcome them and the cutting, hacking, and chopping of their bodies in the barbarous manner aforesaid were committed with treachery.<br\/><br\/>The defendants, Gregorio Domingo, Segundo Orozco, and Rafael de la Cruz, are natives of the Philippine Islands, above 25 years of age, and men of very ordinary intelligence.\u00a0 This fact is considered and determined by the court as an extenuating circumstance.<br\/><br\/>5. That the two discharged defendants are very young, inexperienced men and not possessed of sufficient intelligence to resist the influence of older men, such as the defendants, Domingo, Orozco, and De la Cruz.<br\/><br\/>The court therefore finds, from the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendants Gregorio Domingo, Segundo Orozco, and Rafael de la Cruz each guilty of the crime charged in the complaint in this cause, and the aggravating circumstances being counterbalanced by the said extenuating circumstance, the court sentences the said defendants, Gregorio Domingo, Segundo Orozco, and Rafael de la Cruz, each to imprisonment for their natural life (<i>cadena perpetua<\/i>), in the public <i>carcel<\/i> at Bilibid, in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands, from and including this date, and each of said defendants to pay one-sixth of the costs of this case.<br\/><br\/>This sentence was pronounced December 1, 1908.\u00a0 Domingo and Cruz did not appeal from the judgment, and as to them the sentence is being executed.\u00a0 The defendant Orozco appealed, and while the appeal was pending he moved in this court for a new trial, on the ground of newly discovered evidence.\u00a0 The motion was directed to be heard and determined when the case came on for hearing on the merits.<br\/><br\/>Without reference to the so-called newly discovered evidence, the question is whether the evidence produced at the trial is sufficient to justify the conviction of Orozco of the crime of robbery with homicide.<br\/><br\/>1.\u00a0 On the early morning of September 24, 1908, the dead bodies of two Chinese, Coa Sin and Lim Ping, were found in a <i>tienda<\/i> near the Intendencia Building at the Santo Domingo gate of the Walled City.\u00a0 The bodies were covered with wounds and the inside room where the men slept was in confusion.\u00a0 Boxes and trunks were broken open, the cash drawer was open and empty, and clothing, cigars, and cigarettes were scattered about the floor.\u00a0 Within a short time thereafter these defendants were brought or came before the authorities, and all made statements with reference to their connection with the crime.\u00a0 Deang and Andres made full confessions, and subsequently testified for the Government.\u00a0 Domingo, according to the testimony of the witness Marshall, first denied any connection with the crime, but after hearing the statements of Deang and Andres, agreed to go with the officers and show where Orozco and Cruz, who had been named by Deang and Andres, lived.\u00a0 Cruz and Orozco, when identified by Domingo, were arrested.\u00a0 On the following\u00a0 day when confronted\u00a0 by these men, Domingo stated that they were with him, and that he wanted to tell the truth about the matter.\u00a0 He then said that he was out fishing near the Elks' Club when Orozco and Cruz, with Deang, Andres, and another man by the name of Leon, invited him to go to the Walled City; that after some talk and threats he went with them down Calle Palacio and along the car line to the Intendencia Building and the Chinese store.\u00a0 This statement seems to have been made on the 7th of November, and on the following morning the witness Marshall, with Domingo and other secret-service men, got into a <i>carretela<\/i>, and the <i>cochero<\/i> was directed by Domingo to the <i>tienda<\/i> where the Chinamen had been killed.\u00a0 When asked to show how the entrance to the <i>tienda<\/i> was effected, Domingo stated \"that he was standing outside of the tienda; that Segundo (Orozco) 'was the first man in, and when he entered he had a kris and knife, and that it was he who met the Chinamen at the door.\u00a0 The first blow that was struck was on the left side of the neck.\"\u00a0 Marshall says that he \"asked him what the Chinaman had in his hand, and he stated he had a little light\u2014alamp.\u00a0 I asked him where the body of the other Chinaman was lying, and he pointed to the place where the body was lying when I found it.\u00a0 I asked him if this Chinaman had anything in his hand, and he saw a little candlestick on top of the shelf there, and said, 'this is the candlestick that this Chinaman had in his hand.'\u00a0 Then I had him go outside to show us how the door was opened.\u00a0 On going outside, he says, 'this door is changed; there used to be a place right here where you could get your hand through; they have nailed a board on.'\u00a0 We then had that board taken off, and he put his hand inside and showed how the bolt was pulled, and illustrated on me the way that the first blow was struck to the Chinaman; that after the Chinaman had fallen behind the door Segundo (Orozco) stabbed him in the back, at the same time saying, 'Where is your money; where is your money?'\u00a0 And then he turned to Rafael (Cruz) and says, 'Come on in here and get busy and search the house;' and he, Gregorio (Domingo) stated that he did not go in the <i>tienda<\/i>, that he stayed outside, he was'afraid to go in.\"\u00a0 A shirt which was found in the <i>tienda<\/i> was identified by Domingo as belonging to Orozco. He also said that Deang, Andres, and the\u00a0 man named Leon were also with him outside of the <i>tienda<\/i> on guard; that after Orozco came out, he found Domingo standing there, and said to him, \"You needn't wait here any longer.\u00a0 Get out.\"\u00a0 When asked how much money they got, Domingo said he could not say; that he saw Orozco give Rafael de la Cruz something, saying, \"This is yours,\" and that he then went home.<br\/><br\/>After Domingo made this statement at the <i>tienda<\/i>, he was taken home and confronted with Orozco.\u00a0 The statements were\u00a0 there repeated, and Orozco denied having had any connection with the transaction.\u00a0 He claimed, however, that the shirt which had been found in the <i>tienda<\/i> belonged to Domingo.\u00a0 On one of the occasions when Domingo and Orozco were being questioned they quarreled, and Orozco charged Domingo with killing the Chinese, and when asked how he knew it, replied that he saw Domingo do it.\u00a0 When asked, \"How did you see him?\"\u00a0 Orozco replied, \"I was passing by there going to the market, coming or going, and saw Domingo at the <i>tienda<\/i>.\"\u00a0 When asked to take the officer there Orozco quieted down, and said, \"I didn't mean that, I just became angry because he was accusing me, and I just said that for that.\"\u00a0 When Orozco was on the stand testifying in his own behalf, he admitted having made this<br\/>statement, and gave the same explanation.<br\/><br\/>The witness Hartpence, who was present when Domingo made his statement, testified at the trial, and in all substantial respects corroborated the evidence given by Marshall as above recited.\u00a0 He said that Domingo stated that Orozco, Cruz, and Leon all went inside the <i>tienda<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Lope Deang testified that he had been working for the Atlantic Gulf Company for nine months prior to the time of the murder; that he knew Domingo; Cruz, and Orozco; that about 5 o'clock on September 23 Domingo asked him and Andres where they worked, and was told that they worked for the Atlantic Gulf Company at the sewer.\u00a0 He then asked them how much they got a day, and on being told that they received 80 centavos, he told them to go with him, and he would give them work at Pl a day.\u00a0 Sometime during the night Domingo came to the house of Deang and asked him to come down, as it was late.\u00a0 Deang responded and was sent by Domingo to find Andres, and instructed to bring him to Calle Carolina.\u00a0 Upon arriving there they tfound Domingo, Cruz, and the man called Leon.\u00a0 They then went together to the Intendencia Building.\u00a0 When they came opposite the <i>tienda<\/i> they stopped, and Domingo told them to wait awhile, as he was going to get some bread.\u00a0 The <i>tienda<\/i> was closed, and at that moment the bread wagon arrived and the baker knocked at the\u00a0 door of the <i>tienda<\/i> and asked the Chinaman to come out and get the bread.\u00a0 After the Chinaman got the bread he closed the window (door) again, as it was very early.\u00a0 Domingo then asked the Chinaman to open the window again, as he wanted to buy some bread.\u00a0 The Chinaman opened the door to Domingo \"and suddenly we noticed that the lights of the <i>tienda<\/i> were put out, and that there was some noise inside of the <i>tienda<\/i>, as if there was some fighting in the <i>tienda<\/i>, and I heard then Domingo saying, 'Rafael, Leon, come inside and help me,' and Santos Andres and myself stayed there at a distance, watching them near a post.\"\u00a0 After a while they came out.\u00a0 One of them was carrying some cigars, and the other had cigarettes in his hand.\u00a0 Domingo had some money,<br\/>and offered some to Deang, who did not take it.\u00a0 Domingo then threatened to kill them if they told what had occurred.\u00a0 After that Deang and Andres went away, and did not know where the others went.\u00a0\u00a0 Domingo entered the <i>tienda<\/i> first, and Orozco next.\u00a0 When they came out, Domingo's hands were bloody.<br\/><br\/>In the <i>tienda<\/i> there was found a shirt which Domingo testified was worn by Orozco on the night of the murder.\u00a0 Orozco denied that it was his, and claimed that it belonged to Domingo.\u00a0 The evidence tends to show that it was the property of Orozco.<br\/><br\/>Santos Andres told substantially the same story, in every essential matter corroborating the evidence given by Deang.\u00a0 Neither of the witnesses claimed to have seen Orozco kill the Chinaman, but both testified that they saw him enter the <i>tienda<\/i>, evidently going to the assistance of Domingo.\u00a0 We have then the testimony of Marshall and Hartpence as to the statements made by Domingo, and the direct testimony of Deang and Andres, which make Orozco a principal<br\/>in the crime.\u00a0 Orozco testified in his own behalf, stating that he spent the night in question at home, until about 5 o'clock in the morning, when he went out to get fish.\u00a0 He denied that the shirt belonged to him, but admitted that when he was being examined before the officers he told Domingo that he saw him kill the Chinamen.\u00a0 The explanation of this statement has already been referred to.\u00a0 Orozco's wife and another witness corroborated his statement as to his whereabouts on the night in question.\u00a0 The evidence of Deang and Andres impressed the trial court as true, and we have received the same impression from a careful reading of the record.\u00a0 The slight differences therein are such as would naturally occur, and are <i>indicia<\/i> of truth rather than falsehood.\u00a0 We are satisfied that the evidence establishes the guilt of these men, and that the court properly found them guilty as charged in the information.<br\/><br\/>2.\u00a0 We then come to the question of the right of Orozco to a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence.\u00a0 The affidavits presented tell a remarkable story.\u00a0 Orozco and the other defendants were sentenced December 1, 1908, and about the 24th of December, 1908, a person by the name of Alberto David\u00a0 made a so-called confession in which he stated that he, in company with Gregorio Medrano and Crisanto Magalindan, robbed this tienda and killed the Chinamen.\u00a0 The circumstances of the crime were related in detail by David, and on its face the story might well tend to shake our confidence in the guilt of the men who had been convicted.\u00a0 David gave a description of the property which he and his companions stole from the <i>tienda<\/i>, and told what had been done with each article.\u00a0 It did not appear that any of the articles had ever been in the <i>tienda<\/i> of the Chinamen, but the fact that they were subsequently found where David stated that he had sold or disposed of them tended to confirm his story.\u00a0 The confession was made in the presence of Gregorio Panlequi, <i>presidente<\/i> of Floridablanca, Pampanga, and others.\u00a0 Gregorio Medrano was arrested and he also promptly and without hesitation confessed that he had participated in the robbery and murder.\u00a0 The other alleged murderer was never found.\u00a0 But this elaborate structure suddenly collapsed.\u00a0 David retracted his confession, and in doing so told an even more sensational story.\u00a0 As in the beginning, Gregorio Medrano promptly followed David and retracted his confession.\u00a0 On January 5, 1909 David, in the presence of certain officials and Assemblyman Mercado, made the following statements:<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What is your name, age, residence, occupation, etc. ?\u2014A.\u00a0 Alberto David y Ocampo; 21 years of age; occupation, <i>casquero<\/i>; residence, barrio of Baruya, municipality of Lubao, Province of Pampanga; single, born in Macabebe, Pampanga.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Did you ever work in Manila?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes; I worked from September, 1907, to October, 1908, as a <i>casquero<\/i> on a <i>casco<\/i> owned by Eligio Naval.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Who was the <i>patron<\/i> of that <i>casco<\/i>?\u2014A.\u00a0 At first the <i>patron<\/i> was Dionisio Bernal, and later Bonifacio Gabriel was the patron.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Why did you make the statement to me that you, in company with Gregorio Medrano and Crisanto Magalindan, murdered and robbed the two Chinamen in their <i>tienda<\/i> at the Santo Domingo gate during\u00a0 the\u00a0 month of September, 1908?\u2014A.\u00a0 When I was in Baruya a man named Juan Rivera warned me that an American and a Filipino of the secret service were coming after me.\u00a0 The <i>teniente<\/i> of the barrio, whose name is Felipe Turla heard of this, and they arrested me and delivered me to Gregorio Panlequi, <i>presidente<\/i> of Floridablanca.\u00a0 While I was at the <i>presidente's<\/i> house he taught me what I should say when brought to Manila.\u00a0 The <i>presidente<\/i> told me to say that I had been invited by Gregorio Medrano and Crisanto Magalindan to go with them to the Chinese <i>tienda<\/i> at the Santo Domingo gate to buy cigarettes, and then\u00a0 state that I saw Gregorio and Crisanto enter the Chinese store and kill the Chinamen, while I watched outside.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What promise did the <i>presidente<\/i> make to you to induce you to make this statement?\u2014A.\u00a0 He told me not to be afraid of going to jail as he would take care of me, and also that I would receive a reward.\u00a0 He did not say how much the reward would be.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What did he tell you to state about those watches and rings?\u2014A.\u00a0 He did not tell me to state anything about them, as they are mine.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Then all you stated to me was false\u00a0 and you only stated it because you were instructed to do so by the <i>presidente<\/i> of Floridablanca and the <i>teniente<\/i> of Baruya?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Do you made this statement voluntarily?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes.\"<br\/><br\/>About the same time Gregorio Medrano on being again examined, made the following statement:<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Why did you state to me in the presence of Captain Opperman in Sexntoan at the time of your arrest that you went with Alberto David and Crisanto Magalindan and robbed a Chinese <i>tienda<\/i> at Sto. Domingo Gate (Intramuros), and murdered the two Chinamen there?\u2014A.\u00a0 I only stated to you that I got the\u00a0 watch, which you showed\u00a0 me, from Alberto.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Did Alberto tell you what to state if you were arrested?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.\u00a0 He told me a few days before Christmas in my house in Sexmoan, if I should get arrested to say 'Yes.'\u00a0 I am guilty of anything I am asked.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Who was with Alberto at that time?\u2014A.\u00a0 The other men\u2014<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Why did Alberto tell you to say you are guilty if you are not?\u2014A.\u00a0 He only told me to say 'I am guilty' and he would get P1,000, and he would give my sisters some money, and that he would get a lawyer for me and get me out of prison.\u00a0 And since we have been arrested Alberto said to me, 'Why\u00a0 did you not say you are guilty? Now I can not get the money, because you do not still say you are guilty.'<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Then all that you first stated about killing the two Chinamen and robbing their store at Santo Domingo gate was false?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.\u00a0 Alberto also told me that since I have not told the same story as I did at first, he will tell the same one, no matter what happens to him, and also get me into trouble with him.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Do you make this statement voluntarily and of your own free will and without promise of reward or immunity?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.\"<br\/><br\/>It is proper to state also that because of all these events the defendant Gregorio Domingo was on January 4, 1909, brought from Bilibid and questioned by the prosecuting attorney and the judge of the Court of First Instance, and that he then told substantially the story which the witnesses Marshall and Hartpence testified that he told when examined by them shortly after the robbery and murder.\u00a0 The statements appear in the affidavit presented on the affidavit upon motion for a new trial for Orozco.<br\/><br\/>Further comment seems unnecessary.\u00a0 The motion of the defendant Orozco for a new trial is denied, and the judgment and sentence imposed upon him is in all things affirmed.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

ANTONINA LAMPANO AND RAYMUNDO ZAPANTA, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The complaint in this case, which is dated February 1908, charges accused with the crime of adultery, committed as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That the said Antonina Lampano, although united in lawful and canonical marriage with the complaining witness from the 17th of June of the year 1886, which marriage was not dissolved or annulled up to this date, lived together with the other accused Raymundo Zapanta as his wife in the pueblo of Angeles, of this province, from the 1st of July, 1906, up to this date, from which illicit relations and sexual intercourse they have a daughter who was baptized as a legitimate child in the parish of the same pueblo on November 27, 1907; all contrary to law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The trial court found the accused guilty of the crime with which they were charged, and sentenced each of them to three years six months and twenty-one days' imprisonment in Bilibid Prison, with hard labor, and to pay one-half of the costs.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of record conclusively establishes that throughout the period indicated in the complaint, the accused, Raymundo Zapanta, had illicit relations with his codefendant, Antonina Lampano, and that the latter is, and during that period was, the lawful wife of the complainant, Pascual Acu\u00f1a.<br\/><br\/>These facts are substantially admitted upon appeal, but counsel for appellants vigorously contend that there is not sufficient evidence in the record to sustain a finding that the accused Zapanta knew that his codefendant, Antonina Lampano, was married at the time when he had these relations with her, and that, in the absence of proof of that fact, the judgment of conviction must be reversed, such knowledge, under the provisions of article 434 of the Penal Code which defines and penalizes the crime of adultery, being an essential element of the crime.\u00a0 We think, however, that Zapanta's knowledge of the fact that his codefendant was married to Acu\u00f1a was proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 As far back as the year 1899, Zapanta was on friendly terms with Acu\u00f1a, visited at Acuna's house, where Acu\u00f1a lived together with his wife, and at that time she was introduced to Zapanta as Acuna's wife.\u00a0 From that time until the time when he was arrested in 1908, the two accused have been on intimate terms, and during a considerable portion of that period have lived together, Zapanta having taken the woman away from her husband's home in 1900, and again in 1903, and yet again in 1906.\u00a0 The woman had three children by her husband, who bore his name, and were known to Zapanta as the children of Acu\u00f1a.\u00a0 These children lived at times with their father, and at times with their mother and her paramour, by whom on such occasions they were supported; and, if the testimony of the accused themselves can be believed, the two accused, on various occasions contributed, from their joint earnings, money which was delivered to the father partly for his own support and partly for the support of his children.\u00a0 Throughout the long period during which these illicit relations existed, Zapanta and Acu\u00f1a were well known to each other, and keeping in mind the circumstances under which the accused first became known to each other, the repeated conciliations between husband and wife followed by her repeated desertion of her home with Zapanta, the existence of the children, and the attitude of both accused toward\u00a0 them, Zapanta's bare denial of all knowledge of the fact that his codefendant was married to the complainant is in our opinion wholly incredible and unworthy of belief.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for appellants insist that the complaint is insufficient and fatally defective, in that it fails to allege that the accused, Raymundo Zapanta, was aware of the fact that his coaccused was a married woman at the time when he had illicit relations with her, and further because, as counsel alleges, it charges two offenses, the private crime of adultery, defined and penalized in the Penal Code, committed prior to October 11, 1907, the date of the passage of Act No. 1773 of the Philippine Commission, and the public crime of adultery, as defined in that Act, committed since that date.<br\/><br\/>It is sufficient answer to these contentions to point out that no objection was raised upon these grounds in the court below.\u00a0 In the language of the syllabus in the case of Mortiga <i>vs<\/i>. Serra et al. (5 Phil. Rep., 34, following U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Sarabia, 4 Phil. Rep., 566), \"Objections to the complaint, based upon an insufficient statement of the facts constituting the offense, will not be considered by this court when they were not presented to the court below;\" and in the language of the syllabus of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in that case on appeal, \"while a complaint on a charge of adultery under the Penal Code of the Philippine Islands may be fatally defective for lack of essential averments as to place and knowledge on the part of the man that the woman was married, objections of that nature must be taken at the trial, and, if not taken, and the omitted averments are supplied by competent proof, it is not error\u00a0 for the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands to refuse to sustain such objections on appeal.\"\u00a0 (204 U. S.,\u00a0 470; also reported in 11 Phil. Rep., 762.)<br\/><br\/>And while it is true that, under the provisions\u00a0 of section 11 of General Orders, No. 58, a complaint or information should charge but one offense, and that, if the attention of the trial court is directed to the fact that a complaint or information charges more than one offense, it is the duty of the court to direct the prosecution to elect to stand on one of the charges or to file two or more separate complaints or informations charging each crime separately; nevertheless, if by mistake or oversight a complaint does charge two or more separate offenses, and the accused without\u00a0 opposition goes to trial thereon, and the evidence submitted is sufficient to convict him of one of them, he can not be heard to complain on appeal of the fact that there were other offenses charged in the complaint of which he was not convicted.\u00a0 The rule\u00a0 was made more especially for the benefit of the accused in criminal cases, to protect them from being overwhelmed with charges which they might be unable to meet and refute in a single trial; but, if the accused waives the protection of the rule, and undertakes to defend himself against several different offenses charged in the same complaint, he must abide the consequences. Acquittal on the complaint would, forever relieve him of liability\u00a0 to prosecution for any of the offenses charged therein, and no reason can be suggested why he should not be convicted of any one of these offenses, when his guilt is established by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.<br\/><br\/>But it may not be improper to add that defendants by their counsel undertook to controvert the evidence of the prosecution tending to prove that Zapanta knew that his coaccused was a married woman at the time when he had illicit relations with her, and their contentions having been duly considered by the court, they were in nowise prejudiced by the omission of a specific allegation in that regard from the complaint; and, admitting that the provisions of Act No. 1773' changed the essential nature as well as the mode of prosecution of the crime of adultery, the accused were in no real sense prejudiced by the fact that the complaint charges the commission of the crime of adultery prior to the passage of the Act as well as after its passage, for the prosecution having offered evidence to establish the commission of the crime before as well as after the passage of the Act, the accused had full opportunity to offer evidence in their defense as to both periods, of which they did in fact take advantage.<br\/><br\/>Counsel also contend that, since criminal prosecutions for adultery can only be instituted on the complaint of the aggrieved party, who is forever barred from filing such complaint, under the provisions of article 434 of the Penal Code, when he or she has consented to the commission of the adulterous acts, the trial court should have dismissed the complaint in this case without rendering judgment of conviction, because, as counsel allege, the evidence of record discloses that the husband and complainant consented to the adulterous relations of his wife with her codefendant.<br\/><br\/>We are of opinion, however, that the provisions of the Penal Code whereby the consent of the husband to the adulterous relations of his wife forever barred him from filing a complaint, and thus forever relieved the culprits from liability, which was a logical and necessary consequence of the treatment of the crime of adultery strictly as a private crime, must be deemed to have been repealed by necessary implication by the provisions of Act No. 1773, enacted October 11, 1907, which treats the crime, not as a private crime, but as a public crime.<br\/><br\/>Under the provisions of the Penal Code, which treated adultery strictly as a private crime, the law took cognizance only of the injury to the offended person, and when that person, either by consenting to the commission of the adulterous act or by granting a pardon therefor, once waived or surrendered his right to have the offense vindicated by the strong arm of the law, he was forever thereafter barred from filing a complaint, and if a pardon was granted after' the penalty had been imposed, that penalty was remitted.\u00a0 The new law, on the other hand, which treats adultery as a public crime, concerns itself chiefly with the offense to public morals involved in the commission of the adulterous acts, and expressly provides for the prosecution of the offenders \"in the same manner\" as persons charged with other public crimes are prosecuted, with the single proviso that the proceedings can only be instituted by the offended party, that is to say, by the husband or wife, as the case may be.<br\/><br\/>The penalty prescribed for the crime of adultery is that of <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its medium and maximum degrees, and the sentence of the trial court, modified by the substitution of three years six months and twenty-one days of <i>prision correccional<\/i> with the right to an <i>abono<\/i> of one-half the period they may have been held in detention pending trial, in accordance with the provisions of article 93 of <i>Ley Provisional<\/i> for the application of the Penal Code in the Philippine Islands, in lieu of the term of imprisonment with hard labor therein imposed, and by the addition of the subsidiary penalties prescribed\u00a0 iii article 61 of the Penal Code, is hereby affirmed, with a proportionate share of the costs of this instance against each of the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

on the east by the Caguray River; on the south by the land of Felix Lopez; and on the west by the lake of Sabangan.\u00a0 According to the plan accompanying her petition, it has an area of 4,525,359.98 square meters, and for the purposes of taxation was last assessed at $2,000, United States currency.\u00a0 The property is free from all incumbrances, is unoccupied, and she acquired it by inheritance from her father, who in turn obtained it from his ancestors, and it is used for pasturing animals.<br\/><br\/>On the 6th of September, 1905, the petitioner presented a written amendment to her former petition, invoking the provisions of Chapter XI [VI] of Act No. 926, and asking that the prescription therein stated be applied m her case.\u00a0 On the 14th of March, 1906, the Attorney-General stated in writing that he appeared on behalf of the Director of Lands, and requested that he be notified of all future proceedings in the case.<br\/><br\/>On the 26th of March, 1906, the case was heard in Calapan, Province of Mindoro, the petitioner, her counsel, and the provincial fiscal representing\u00a0 the Insular Government being present.\u00a0 On the 10th of July of the same year another hearing was held in this city of Manila, but it does not appear that the Attorney-General and the\u00a0 Director of Lands were previously summoned, nor that the first-named officer was present thereat.<br\/><br\/>Judgment was rendered by the court below on the 30th of the said month of July, decreeing that the said tract of land be adjudicated and registered in favor of the applicant.\u00a0 The Attorney-General was notified of this decision on the following day, the 31st, and on the 13th of September of the same year, a certified copy of the decree with the plan of the estate was forwarded to the Director of Lands, who, on June 20, 1907, addressed an official communication to the Court of Land Registration, inclosing a copy of a true plan of said land that had been drawn up in his office, together with a technical description of the same.<br\/><br\/>For reasons that he gave the Attorney-General requested the lower court on the 27th of the said month and year to review the matter and order the case reopened in accordance with the provisions of section 38 of Act No. 496.\u00a0 He alleged that, upon an examination and survey of the land made by a surveyor of the Bureau of Lands, it appeared that the said land has an area of 1,248 hectares, 57 ares, and 78 centares, and not 452 hectares, 53 ares, and 59 centares as shown on the petition and plan which appear at the beginning of the record of the case, there being, therefore, an excess of 796 hectares, 4 ares and 19 centares; that the plan offered by the interested party as compared with that drawn up by the surveyor of the Bureau does not represent the topography of the place, nor the actual extent of the land; it is seen that the fish pond of Mapaya is not in the center of the land; nor does the latter adjoin the Sabangan Bay, neither is there any resemblance between the rivers shown on both plans; that according to the report of the surveyor, part of the land is a mangrove swamp, the rest has never been under cultivation, and no cocoanut trees grow thereon as averred by certain witnesses for the applicant; that the Director of Lands had not been summoned to appear at the hearing in Manila on the 10th of July, 1906, so that the witnesses for the applicant have not been cross-examined by any official from the Attorney-General's Office; that the decree ordering the registration of the said land was obtained by means of fraud, because the plan offered at the trial was a fictitious one, and the witnesses of the applicant did not testify to the truth; and that for said reason the Insular Government was unlawfully deprived of its ownership of the land adjudicated to the applicant.<br\/><br\/>In view of the above the court below entered an\u00a0 order on the 9th of August, 1907, overruling the foregoing motion of the Attorney-General and directing that title be issued in favor of the applicant in accordance with the approved plan.\u00a0 The Attorney-General excepted to this decision and presented a bill of exceptions for the purpose of having this court review the order alluded to, and on the 10th of February, 1908, the bill of exceptions, together with the amendment allowed on the 6th day of the said month of February, were approved by the trial judge.<br\/><br\/>This appeal was filed against the order dated August 9, 1907, approving the plan prepared by the surveyor of the Bureau of Lands, and denying the motion of the Attorney-General, in which he moved for a review of the case and the judgment, for a reopening of the case under the provisions of section 38 of Act No. 496, and also for a revision of the order granting title to the applicant on the basis of the plan approved by the court.<br\/><br\/>The above motion of the Attorney-General on behalf of the Director\u00a0 of Lands is based on that the final decree ordering the registration of the land of the applicant was obtained by means of fraud, for the reasons alleged in his above-mentioned writing, arid that the Director of Lands received no notice of the hearing that was held on the 10th of July, 1906, in this city of Manila.\u00a0 Thus the witnesses of the petitioner have not been cross-examined by any official from the Attorney-General's Office.<br\/><br\/>After an examination of: the documents and plan submitted by the applicant, and of the result of the evidence given by the witnesses introduced by her, and after considering the merits of the case, it can not be held that the said applicant acted fraudulently and in bad faith.\u00a0 The proceedings do not show that the decree ordering the registration of the land in question was obtained by means of fraud or deceit, and that the provisions of section 38 of Act No. 496 are properly applicable.<br\/><br\/>The failure to cite the Director of Lands to appear, or his absence at the hearing that took place on the 10th of July, 1906, can not be charged to the applicant; and if there was an error in the decision that was rendered without taking into account this defect, the only adequate remedy by which it might have been corrected was an appeal; none was interposed, so that, as the decision has become final, there is no way of lawfully annulling it.<br\/><br\/>As to the fraud charged in obtaining the decree, the fact that, upon a survey by the Government surveyor, the land of the petitioner proved to be more than one-half larger than the area that she had stated, as appears from the plan drawn up for that end, while the interested party only claims the possession and registration of much less than one-half of the area stated by the said surveyor, this does not prove that the applicant acted in bad faith and by means of fraud; there is, therefore, no legal reason to support the revision asked for.<br\/><br\/>In view of the discrepancy between the plans, and of the fact that according to the plan drawn up by the Government surveyor the land sought to be registered is larger than as shown by the plan of the applicant, the court below should have proceeded to make an investigation, without approving the second plan.\u00a0 It is not proper to adjudicate to the applicant more land than she possesses and endeavors to enter in the registry.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, in order to avoid prejudice to the interest of the Government, and in view of the provisions of section 66 of Act No. 926, it is our opinion that the order of the 9th of August, 1907, should be revoked in so far as it approves the new plan drawn up by the Government surveyor, and provides that title be issued to the applicant in accordance with the said plan; otherwise, the said order is hereby affirmed.\u00a0 Let the case be remanded to the Court of Land Registration for a due investigation and determination of the situation, area, and boundaries of the land that the applicant seeks to register under the plan and documents presented by her, with the correction of such errors as her plan may contain, and let a proper decision be entered in due course in accordance with the law.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Uy Cebio, in which action the said Marquez Lim and Hang Wo were present and took part, and the said justice of the peace there decided that Ko Bengco was the owner of said contract and was entitled to a judgment thereon, and did on the 4th day of October, 1906, render a judgment on said contract in favor of Ko Bengco.\u00a0 None of the parties appealed from this judgment; the judgment, therefore, became final as to ail of the parties to it.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that the defendant Uy Cebio, when he paid to the sheriff the said sum of WOO, intended to have it applied upon the contract which he had theretofore executed and delivered in favor of Jose Melliza Te Juat.\u00a0 He indicated that fact to the justice of the peace when he offered him the money and also took a receipt from the sheriff, stating that the payment was for the purpose of paying the amount due on said contract.<br\/><br\/>Our conclusion is, therefore, that the judgment of the justice of the peace with reference to the ownership of said contract is conclusive and the P00 which the said Uy Cebio paid to the sheriff having been paid for the purpose of liquidating the amount due on the said contract, the sheriff had no right or authority to apply the said money to the payment of the judgments of Marquez Lim and Hang Wo, respectively, <i>vs<\/i>. Pe Naco.\u00a0 The sheriff and his deputy having therefore wrongfully applied the said sum of P300 to the payment of the judgments of Marquez Lim and Hang Wo, money which they had received for the benefit of Ko Bengco, they are responsible to the said Ko Bengco for the same.\u00a0 Uy Cebio had a right to indicate upon which of the various claims against him the said payment should be applied.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court is therefore hereby affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J,, Torres, Mapa, Carson, Willard<\/i>, and <i>Tracey, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

and on the 23d day of June, she made demand upon the plaintiff for the sum of $864, Mexican currency, the amount required by the municipal authorities for the renewal of her license.\u00a0 The plaintiff declined to advance this amount, claiming that, under his contract with the defendant, it was defendant's duty to secure these licenses and advance the amount required therefor, the amount thus advanced to be returned to her in six equal monthly installments during the license period.\u00a0 On the same day, June 23, 1903, the defendant formally petitioned the Collector of Internal Revenue for the city of Manila to cancel her application for a renewal of the licenses for the latter half of the year 1903, and also to cancel the unexpired portion of the\u00a0 licenses then in force covering the period down to the end of the month of June.\u00a0 Sometime thereafter and before the 1st day of July, the municipal authorities closed the bar on the ground that the licenses had been canceled; and on the 15th day of July plaintiff made formal delivery of possession of the property to the defendant, protesting at the same time against the action of the defendant in canceling the licenses for the first half of the year 1903 before they had expired, and in failing to secure new licenses for the latter half of that year.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff now prays for P40,000 damages, alleging that as a result of defendant's breach of contract in canceling the licenses in force in the month of June and, failing to secure new licenses for the latter half of the year 1903, he had been compelled to surrender possession of the rented property and to lose the\u00a0 profits which would have accrued to him from the time when the bar and restaurant were closed to the end of the rental period.\u00a0 Defendant denies the alleged breach of contract and insists that the reason for her failure to take out new licenses and for the canceling of the licenses then in existence was the refusal of the plaintiff to advance the amount required by the municipal authorities for the renewal of the licenses, so that any damages which may have ensued were properly to be attributed not to defendant's failure to secure the renewal of the license but to plaintiff's failure to pay therefor.<br\/><br\/>The trial court was of opinion that under the terms of the contract, no obligation was imposed upon the defendant to obtain a license for the operation\u00a0 of the bar, because from its terms it appears that the only thing which was rented was the building together with the furniture and fittings; and held that the plaintiff, having voluntarily surrendered the premises, is estopped from claiming damages resulting from this surrender, notwithstanding the fact that the bar and restaurant were closed by the authorities for lack of the necessary licenses.<br\/><br\/>We think, however, that the provisions of clause nine of the contract clearly imposed upon the defendant the duty of applying for and taking out the necessary licenses for the conduct of the bar and restaurant, the only obligation imposed upon the plaintiff in that regard being the duty of paying therefor.\u00a0 That this is the proper construction of the contract, and the construction placed thereon by the parties themselves, is made clear by the testimony of the defendant herself upon cross-examination, when in answer to the question \"When Don Gavieres rented from you the bar and restaurant, was the bar open?\u00a0 Did it have a license?\"\u00a0 She said:\u00a0 \"Yes, sir, it had a license, and it was in the contract that we were the persons who should apply for the license for the bar and restaurant, but Se\u00f1or Gavieres was to pay for it, and he refused to pay for it.\"\u00a0 She also testified that as a matter of fact she did apply for a renewal of the license for the latter half of the year 1903, in accordance with the terms of her contract, and that the reason the license was not procured was because of the failure of the plaintiff to advance the amount therefor.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff, as appears from the evidence of record, declined to advance this money and insisted that it was the duty of the defendant so to do, the amount thus advanced to be recouped from the plaintiff in six equal installments during the term of the license; and he still insists that such were the terms of his contract with the defendant.\u00a0 An examination of the terms of the written contract, however, leaves no room for doubt that under its terms, it was plaintiff's duty to pay such amount as was required by the municipal authorities for the license, and nowhere in that contract is it made the duty of the defendant to advance the cost of the licenses and recover the amount thus advanced in installments, as claimed by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff, testifying in his own behalf, swore that during the period from January\u00a0 to June while he operated the bar and restaurant, he had as a matter of fact paid to the defendant in monthly installments the amount of the license for the first half of the year 1903, in installments, though apparently not, as he alleges, in six equal installments.\u00a0 But keeping in mind the circumstances under which these payments were made, the fact that the amount of the license for the first half of the year 1903 was paid in installments is in itself by no means sufficient to establish plaintiff's contention that the original contract contemplated the continuance of a similar arrangement throughout the rental period, or that the contract had been modified to that effect by agreement between the parties after the execution of the contract.\u00a0 It appears that the license for the first half of 1903 had already been secured before the rental contract was entered into on the 8th day of January, and the fact that the defendant agreed to accept and did accept reimbursement for the amount paid therefor in installments, by no means justifies the plaintiff's contention that the terms of the written contract were so modified as to impose upon the defendant the duty of advancing the amount required for the various renewals of the licenses throughout the entire rental term of six years.\u00a0 Defendant positively denied the existence of any agreement for a modification of the terms of the written contract, and indeed plaintiff, when testifying in his own behalf, did not positively claim that such an agreement had been formally and expressly entered into between the parties, and relied rather upon the alleged implied modification of the contract resulting from the conduct of the defendant in accepting reimbursement, in installments, for the amount paid for the licenses for the first half of the year 1903.<br\/><br\/>We are of opinion that defendant, having applied for a renewal of the license for the latter half of the year 1903, and plaintiff having formally declined to advance the amount necessary to secure the issuance of such renewal, defendant's failure to secure the renewal of the license was due to plaintiff's fault, and plaintiff, therefore, is not entitled to damages because of the\u00a0 failure to procure the renewal of the licenses.\u00a0 We think, however, that defendant was clearly at fault in having the unexpired portion of the license for the first half of the year 1903 canceled at the same time that she withdrew her application for a renewal of the old license.\u00a0 The evidence of record discloses that the plaintiff had reimbursed her for the full amount expended therefor, and she herself, while denying that she was reimbursed for the amount paid for the license, stated that when the contract was executed, she made a gift to her tenant of\u00a0 the license down to the 1st of July.\u00a0 The failure of the plaintiff to advance the amount necessary to secure a renewal of the license in nowise justified her in having the license for the first half of the year, which she\u00a0 had sold or ceded to the plaintiff, canceled, and under the terms of her contract, it was clearly her duty, the tenant having paid for the license, to secure to him, as far as in her power lay, the benefits to be derived therefrom.<br\/><br\/>We think there can be no doubt that the plaintiff, as a result of her breach of contract in this regard, was entitled to damages for any losses which he may have sustained as a result of the closing of the bar by the municipal authorities, from the time when it was closed until the 30th of June, when the license expired; but, while it is clear from the record that the municipal authorities closed the bar sometime between the 23d day of June, when defendant asked to have the license canceled, and the last day of that month, there is no evidence as to the precise day or hour when such action was taken, nor is there any satisfactory evidence as to the amount per diem of the losses suffered by the plaintiff while the bar and restaurant were closed in the month of June.\u00a0 The only testimony as to the date when the municipal authorities closed the bar was the statement of the\u00a0 plaintiff himself, who said that about the middle of June the police came and ordered him to close up the business on account of there being no license.\u00a0 The other evidence of record, however, leaves no room for doubt that defendant did not apply for the cancellation of the license until the 23d of June, and it nowhere appears how long after that date or before the end of the month the bar and restaurant were actually closed.\u00a0 Plaintiff claimed that the monthly profits from the <i>hotel<\/i>, bar, and restaurant conducted in the rented building amounted to some seven or eight hundred pesos during the period it was under his control, but it nowhere appears how much these profits were affected by the canceling of the license for the restaurant and bar.\u00a0 Plaintiff having failed to establish definitely the amount of his damages, which at most would amount to no more than the probable profits of the bar for the few days in June, 1903, during which it was closed by order of the municipal authorities, no judgment can be rendered therefor in his favor.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons assigned in this opinion, the judgment of the trial court should be and is hereby affirmed, but without costs to either party in this instance or in the court below.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

David y de Leon; I have received\u00a0 the said amount in legal silver coin, and on account of the same debt I deliver also to the said Do\u00f1a Manuela the ten folios of the title deed of two parcels of the above lands; but the title deed relating to the third one can not be delivered to\u00a0 her because it is attached to the deed of Do\u00f1a Anatalia Pangilinan, which is at present in the possession of Don Valentin Viola; so that I have delivered to the said Do\u00f1a Manuela only a receipt therefor, which receipt was given to me by Don Valentin; and with regard to the above-cited lands, I hereby deliver to my above creditor the full possession, administration and intervention as well as of all trees planted thereon, and she shall be recognized as the true owner until I have paid the full amount mentioned on the other side of this (document).<br\/><br\/>\"And I ratify the above forever, and in witness thereof I have signed the same,\u00a0 as well as the two other witnesses above mentioned.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It will be observed that this private instrument mentions three tracts of land, while the notarial document of 1898 mentions only two tracts.\u00a0 The third tract of land mentioned in the private document is not involved in this case and the petitioners do not here claim to be the owners of it.\u00a0 The theory of the appellant, Sabat, is that this agreement constitutes a mortgage and annuls the previous purchase made by Do\u00f1a Manuela in 1898.\u00a0 That document of 1898 conveyed the ownership of the property to the mother of the petitioners.\u00a0 No repurchase having been made within three years from this date, the purchaser was, on the 30th day of June, 1901, the absolute owner of the property.\u00a0 It can not be presumed that, being the absolute owner of the property, she gave up that ownership and accepted the position of a mere mortgagee.\u00a0 It is to be considered, on the contrary, as held by the court below, that the purpose of this document was to give Do\u00f1a Manuela an additional tract of land as security for her debt which had increased from 3,500 pesos in 1898, to 4,500 pesos in 1901, and the most that can be claimed is that this instrument was intended not to change the nature of the contract previously made between the parties, which was that of a sale with a right to repurchase, to an entirely different kind of contract, namely a mortgage, but rather to continue the relation previously existing between them as to the two tracts of land included in the deed of 1898, and to make that contract extensive to the third tract of land.\u00a0 This view would give to the contract of 1901 the nature of a sale with the\u00a0 right to repurchase.\u00a0 That it is such a contract is evidenced by the statement in the latter part of it to the effect that Do\u00f1a Manuela is to be considered as the true owner as long as the amount due was not returned.\u00a0 A somewhat similar document was held to evidence a sale with the right to repurchase in the case of Albert <i>vs.<\/i> Punsalan (9 Phil. Rep., 294).\u00a0 See also Espiritu <i>vs.<\/i> Luis (5 Phil. Rep., 482).<br\/><br\/>Considering it as a sale with the right to repurchase, no time being mentioned therein for the exercise of the right to repurchase, it lasted only for four years, which had expired\u00a0 prior to the commencement of this proceeding.\u00a0 (Art. 1508, Civil Code; Alano <i>vs.<\/i> Babasa, 10 Phil. Rep., 511; Garcia <i>vs.<\/i> Diamson, 8 Phil. Rep., 414.)<br\/><br\/>This view of the nature of the relations between the parties is borne out by the evidence in regard to the possession of the land.\u00a0 Although the defendant Sabat testified that he had been in possession of the property until 1905, the evidence of the petitioners satisfies us that they and their mother had been in possession since 1901, and probably since 1898.\u00a0 Gelasio Buencamino testified that he went to see Anastasio Sabat in 1901 to tell him that the time to repurchase had expired and that Sabat\u00a0 then told him that the purchaser should continue in possession because he, Sabat, had no money with which to repurchase the property.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below in reference to the claim of this appellant must be affirmed,<br\/><br\/>2.\u00a0 The appellant Nicasia Viceo claims title to only a part of the property described in the petition.\u00a0 She bases her claim upon a private document signed by Anastasio Sabat on the 1st of October, 1893, which contains the following statements:<br\/><blockquote>\"I hereby\u00a0 declare that I own a rice field in the sitio of Tagulod, San Roque, within the limits of the pueblo of Gapang, of 11 <i>cavanes<\/i> of seed, which land I bought from Lakan-ilaw, De los Reyes, and Sankal, bounded on the east and south by lands also belonging to me, on the west by the lands of Don Damaso Lakan-ilaw, and on the north by the lands of Marcelo Yuson, as shown in the document consisting of 12 folios and made a part of the present instrument on this date; I have agreed to sell the said land with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> to Do\u00f1a Nicasia Viceo, of San Rafael, for the sum of 1,000 pesos which I have duly received in legal currency from her, and in consideration thereof I have transferred to the said Nicasia Viceo the possession and enjoyment\u00a0 of that property; I have, however, requested her, and we so agreed, that I would work and cultivate said land for the sum of 200 pesos which I will pay her annually as rent beginning this day, and I hereby promise, and we have so agreed, that I should not redeem the said land except after the expiration of four years, which is the period above stipulated; notwithstanding this proviso, in case that, during the existence of the lease, I fail to pay the 200 pesos agreed upon, she shall have the right to oust me from the land the first year of such default without any further claim on my part, and I also promise to deliver to Do\u00f1a Nicasia the title deed of the lands in Tagulod, as soon as I can get it from the Government.\u00a0 In testimony whereof I signed this instrument in the presence of the witnesses Don Ramon Ilusorio and Don Pedro Guinegundo.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This, being a private document, never was recorded in the registry of property.\u00a0 The court below held that the land described in this document was not included in the land described in the petition and this finding of fact must, in our opinion, be sustained.\u00a0 Emiliano Tecson, a witness for this appellant, and Gelasio Buencamino, the guardian of the petitioners, agreed that the land now occupied by Tecson as the tenant of Nicasia, and the land claimed by her are situated in the second parcel described in the patent issued by the Government to Anastasio Sabat, and toward the west.\u00a0 It would therefore be bounded both on the east and west by the land of the petitioners, but the document of 1893 names as the boundary upon the west the land of Damaso Lakan-ilaw, and the answer presented by this defendant in this proceeding names as the\u00a0 adjoining proprietor on the west Andres Lakan-ilaw.\u00a0 It is impossible to fit this description to the land claimed by Do\u00f1a Nicasia, for if the boundary on the west is not the land of the petitioners, it certainly would be the land at the extreme west of the land of the petitioners, which is land not owned by any of the family of Lakan-ilaw, but on the contrary owned by other persons. Moreover, it is entirely improbable that Anastasio Sabat owning a tract of land 19 hectares in extent would have sold 14 hectares out of the middle of the tract, leaving two narrow portions one to the east and the other to the west.<br\/><br\/>The evidence in regard to the possession also satisfies us that the land described in the appellant's document of 1893 is no part of the land described in the petition.\u00a0 It is true that Emiliano Tecson testified that he had been in possession of the land for fourteen years, but the testimony in favor of the petitioners, which strongly preponderates, is to the effect that he had been in possession only since the year 1906, and that the petitioners and their mother had been in possession at least since 1901 and probably since 1898.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below as to this parcel must also be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>The result of the whole case is that the judgment of the court below in its entirety is affirmed, with the costs of this instance\u00a0 against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

No. 5190, July 28, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, <i>VS.<\/i> JOSE CONSUELO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">Before 10 o'clock on the evening of the 7th of\u00a0 December, 1908, Rosa Reposar was in the house of her sister, Consolacion Reposar, lying in a hammock, together with her little child, when Jose Consuelo, her husband, made his appearance and asked her to go home, whereupon Rosa at once left Consolacion's house, and followed her husband.\u00a0 Shortly thereafter, Rosa was heard crying out for help from her own house, which was close by that of Consolacion; the latter's husband woke up at once, and was about to render assistance, but the said Consolacion prevented his leaving; by this time the accused appeared near by calling for Consolacion's husband, but, as the latter paid no attention to him, he tried to enter their house, but one of the children saw his intention and locked the door.\u00a0 Consolacion then cried out for the police, thereby waking her brother, Pio Reposar, who was in his own house and who went to inquire what was the matter.\u00a0 Consolacion replied that there was a quarrel in Rosa Reposar's house, and Pio went thither, but the accused was no longer to be found; he only saw Rosa Reposar lying dead upon the floor, with a wound in the neck and two in the right side of her body.\u00a0 Prom the investigation it further appears that the accused Consuelo, after killing his wife with a bolo, left his house carrying the weapon, and called at the <i>tribunal<\/i> or municipal building, where he delivered it with fresh blood stains to Laureano Molina, a policeman on duty, telling him that he had killed his wife, Rosa, and on being asked the reason by the policeman the accused replied that such had been his luck.\u00a0 The policeman then arrested him and reported the affair to his sergeant, Bonifacio Salazar, and handed him the bloodstained <i>bolo<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing facts the provincial fiscal, on the 14th of the said month, filed an information with the Court of First Instance of Leyte against Jose Consuelo, charging him with the crime of parricide committed with premeditation, treachery, and cruelty on the person of his lawful wife, Rosa Reposar, and inflicting on her three mortal wounds, to wit, one in the neck, and two in the right side, in consequence of which the woman died instantly.<br\/><br\/>Proceedings were instituted, and the trial judge entered judgment therein on the 14th of January, 1909, sentencing the accused to the penalty of death, to be carried out at the place and in the manner provided by law, and further sentenced him to pay an indemnity of P500 to the heirs of the deceased, and, in case of a pardon being granted, to suffer the accessory penalties of article 53 of the Penal Code, without prejudice to the submission of the case to the Supreme Court for a review of the judgment, whether or not appeal were taken by the accused.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the above-stated facts, which have been fully proven in the case, that the serious crime of parricide, defined and punished by article 402 of the Penal Code with two indivisible penalties, to wit, life imprisonment (<i>cadena perpetua<\/i>) to death, has been committed, inasmuch as it has been fully shown in the proceedings that Jose Consuelo killed his wife with a <i>bolo<\/i>, the wounds discovered on her body, especially the one inflicted on the neck being serious and mortal.\u00a0 With the exception of a little child that the deceased was looking after, there is no eyewitness to the crime, which was committed in the house of the said spouses, as it does not appear that the boy Marcelo, their own child, was present at the time, and for this reason it could not be ascertained if the aggression had been committed treacherously; but it can not be doubted that, when the accused attacked his wife with a deadly weapon, she was unarmed and defenseless, and he took advantage of the superior force that his sex and the weapon that he was carrying afforded him; the woman who was attacked being unarmed, was accordingly overcome and could not defend herself, and probably not even escape from the savage attack of her aggressor.<br\/><br\/>The guilt of the defendant as the sole, proven, confessed, and convicted author of said crime is unquestionable, because, apart from the fact that when Pio Reposar went to the house in response to the cries for help uttered by the deceased and found the defendant no longer there, although he had been there shortly before, and found only the still warm body of the unfortunate Rosa with three wounds, Consolacion Reposar, the surviving sister of the victim, having previously seen the said Jose Consuelo when he descended from his house after the cries of his wife, carrying a <i>bolo<\/i> in his hand, it further appears that, shortly after the crime, said accused reported at the municipal building and delivered the blood-stained instrument of the crime to the policeman on duty, Laureano Molina, and voluntarily informed him and Sergeant Bonifacio that he had killed his wife with the weapon, and afterwards repeated this confession when pleading guilty at the preliminary investigation, and when arraigned in court.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the parricide no mitigating circumstance is present, but, on the contrary, there are two aggravating ones, premeditation and abuse of superiority, as hereinbefore mentioned, for the record discloses that the accused was in the habit of misbehaving and improperly conducting himself toward his wife and that he was accustomed to abandon and ill treat her to such an extent that she was obliged to complain to the justice of the peace about one month before the affray, when the defendant was punished with fifteen days' imprisonment for ill treatment and threats.<br\/><br\/>From the above, and as it further appears in the case that the accused, while undergoing the said sentence of fifteen days' imprisonment, repeatedly stated to Balbina Alvarado, a booth keeper in the pueblo of Palo who supplied rations to prisoners, that he would soon be wearing a tiger's suit because he was going to stab (<i>pinchar<\/i>) or wound his wife, and that it was preferable to wear such suit as he would have better food as a prisoner; and as he also repeated said statement to Antonio Cemino, an Insular prisoner from Bilibid Prison, telling him three times that he was in jail on account of his wife, and that as soon\u00a0 as released he desired to be like him and other Insular prisoners, it is clear that he intended to kill his wife.\u00a0 Marcelo Consuelo, the 10-year-old son of the accused, stated that on the night of December 7, before his mother was killed, his father had been sharpening the <i>bolo<\/i> which, when shown him, he recognized as his father's property.\u00a0 All of the foregoing facts which have been fully, proven in\u00a0 this case clearly show that the accused had for many days deliberately premeditated the tragic death of his unfortunate wife, and effected the same, with abuse of superior strength, after long and persistent meditation, as already stated.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, in view of the presence of two aggravating circumstances, without any\u00a0 mitigating circumstance, the adequate penalty under rule 1 of article 80 of the Penal Code is the higher of the two indivisible penalties imposed by article 402 of said code, with the accessories thereof.<br\/><br\/>The court, for the reasons above set forth and admitting the conclusions in the judgment appealed from in so far as they are in conformity therewith, is of opinion that the sentence of the lower court should be affirmed with costs, and that the penalty of death\u00a0 imposed on Jose Consuelo should be executed in accordance; with the provisions of Acts Nos. 451 and 1577, provided, however, that, in the event of a pardon being granted, he shall be further sentenced to suffer the accessory penalties of article 53 of said code, and to pay an indemnity of P1,000 to the heirs of the deceased, with the costs of this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

ROMAN ABAYA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">From the hearing of the appeal interposed by Roman Abaya in the special proceedings brought in the Court of First Instance of La Laguna for the settlement of the intestate estate and the distribution of the property\u00a0 of Casiano Abaya it appears:<br\/><br\/>I.\u00a0 As antecedents:\u00a0 that Casiano Abaya, unmarried, the son of Romualdo Abaya and Sabina Labadia, died on the 6th of April, 1899; that Paula\u00a0 Conde, as the mother of the natural children Jose and Teopista Conde, whom she states she\u00a0 had by Casiano Abaya, on the 6th of November, 1905, moved the settlement of the said intestate succession; that an administrator having been appointed for the said estate on the 25th of November, 1905, Roman Abaya, a son of the said Romualdo Abaya and Sabina Labadia, the parents of the late Casiano Abaya, came forward and opposed said appointment and claimed it for himself as being the nearest relative of the deceased; that this was granted by the court below on the 9th of January, 1906; that on the 17th of November, 1906, Roman Abaya moved that, after due process of law, the court declare him to be the sole heir of Casiano Abaya, to the exclusion of all other persons, especially of Paula Conde, and to be therefore entitled to take possession of all the property of said estate, and that it be adjudicated to him; and that on November 22, 1906, the court ordered the publication of notices for the declaration of heirs and distribution of the\u00a0 property of the estate.<br\/><br\/>II.\u00a0 That on the 28th of November, 1906, Paula Conde, in reply to the foregoing motion of Roman Abaya, filed a petition wherein she stated that she acknowledged the relationship alleged by Roman Abaya, but that she considered that her right,was superior to his and moved for a hearing of the matter, and, in consequence of the evidence that she intended to present she prayed that she be declared to have preferential rights to the property left by\u00a0 Casiano Abaya, and that the same be adjudicated to her together with the corresponding products thereof.<br\/><br\/>III.\u00a0 That the trial was held, both parties presenting documentary and oral evidence and the court below entered the following judgment:<br\/><blockquote>\"That the administrator of the estate of Casiano Abaya should recognize Teopista and Jose Conde as being natural children of Casiano Abaya; that the petitioner Paula Conde should succeed to the hereditary rights of her children with respect to the inheritance of their deceased natural father Casiano Abaya; and therefore, it is hereby declared that she is the only heir to the property of the said intestate estate, to the exclusion of the administrator, Roman Abaya.\" <\/blockquote> IV.\u00a0 That Roman Abaya excepted to the foregoing judgment, appealed to this court, and presented the following statement of errors:<br\/><ol><li>The fact that the court below found that an ordinary action for the acknowledgment of natural children under articles 135 and 137 of the Civil Code, might be brought in special probate proceedings.<br\/><\/li><li>The finding that after the death of a person claimed to be an unacknowledged natural child, the mother of such presumed natural child, as heir to the latter, may bring an action to enforce the acknowledgment of her deceased child in accordance with articles 135 and 137 of the Civil Code.<br\/><\/li><li>The finding in the judgment that the alleged continuous possession of the deceased children of Paula Conde of the status of natural children of the late Casiano Abaya, has been fully proven in these proceedings; and<br\/><\/li><li>On the hypothesis that it was proper to adjudicate the property of this intestate estate to Paula Conde, as improperly found by the court below, the court erred in not having declared that said property should be reserved in favor of relatives of Casiano Abaya to the third degree, and in not having previously demanded securities from Paula Ponde to guarantee the transmission of the property to those who might fall within the reservation.<br\/><\/li><\/ol>As to the first error assigned, the question is set up as to whether in special proceedings for the administration and distribution of an intestate estate, an action might be brought to enforce the acknowledgment of the natural child of the person from whom the inheritance is derived, that is to say, whether one might appear as heir on the ground that he is a recognized natural child of the deceased, not having been so recognized by the deceased either voluntarily or compulsorily by reason of a preexisting judicial decision, but asking at the same time that, in the special proceeding itself, he be recognized by the presumed legitimate heirs of the deceased who claim to be entitled to the succession opened in the special proceeding.<br\/><br\/>According to section 782 of the Code of Civil Procedure-<br\/><blockquote>\"If there shall be a controversy before the Court of First Instance as to who the lawful heirs of the deceased person are, or as to the distributive share to which each person is entitled under the law, the testimony as to such controversy shall be taken in writing,by the judge, under oath, and signed by the witness.\u00a0 Any party in interest whose distributive share is affected by the determination of such controversy, may appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance determining such controversy to the Supreme Court, within the time and in the manner provided in the last preceding section.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This court has decided the present question in the manner shown in\u00a0 the case of Juana Pimentel <i>vs<\/i>. Engracio Palanca (5 Phil. Rep., 436.)<br\/><br\/>The main question with regard to the second error assigned, is whether or not the mother of a natural child now deceased, but who survived the person who, it is claimed, was his natural father, also deceased, may bring an action for the acknowledgment of the natural filiation in favor of such child in order to appear in his behalf to receive the inheritance from the person who is supposed to be his natural father.<br\/><br\/>In order to decide in the affirmative the court below has assigned the following as the only foundation:<br\/><blockquote>\"In resolving a similar question Manresa says:\u00a0 'An acknowledgment\u00a0 can only be demanded by the natural child and his descendants whom it shall benefit, and should they be minors or otherwise incapacitated, such person as legally represents them; the mother may ask it in behalf of her child so long as he is under her authority.'\u00a0 On this point no positive declaration has been made, undoubtedly because it was not considered necessary.\u00a0 A private action is in question and the general rule must be followed.\u00a0 Elsewhere the same author adds:\u00a0 'It may so happen that the child dies before four years have expired after attaining majority, or that the document supporting his petition for acknowledgment is discovered after his death, such death perhaps occurring after his parents had died, as is supposed by article 137, or during their lifetime.\u00a0 In any case such right of action shall pertain to the descendants of the child whom the acknowledgment may interest.'\u00a0 (See Commentaries to arts. 135 and 137, Civil Code, Vol. I.)\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The above doctrine, advanced by one of the most eminent commentators of the Civil Code, lacks legal and doctrinal foundation.\u00a0 The power to transmit the right of such action by the natural child to his descendants can not be sustained under the law, and still less to his mother.<br\/><br\/>It is without any support in law\u00a0 because the rule laid down in the code is most positive, limiting in form, when establishing the exception for the exercise of such right of action after the death of the presumed parents, as is shown hereafter.\u00a0 It is not supported by any doctrine, because up to the present time no argument has been presented, upon which even an approximate conclusion could be based.<br\/><br\/>Although the Civil Code considerably improved the condition of recognized natural children, granting them rights and actions that they did not possess under the former laws, they were not, however, placed upon the same plane as legitimate ones.\u00a0 The difference that separates these two classes of children is still great, as proven by so many articles dealing with the rights of the family and with succession in relation to the members thereof.\u00a0 It may be laid down as a legal maxim, that whatever the code does not grant to the legitimate children, or in connection with their rights must still less be understood as granted to recognized natural children or in connection with their rights.\u00a0 There is not a single exception in its provisions.<br\/><br\/>If legitimacy is the attribute that constitutes the basis of the absolute family rights of the child, the acknowledgment of the natural child is, among illegitimate ones, that which unites him to the family of the father or the mother who recognizes him, and affords him a participation in the rights of the family, relatively advantageous according to whether they are alone or whether they concur with other individuals of the family of his purely natural father or mother.<br\/><br\/>Thus, in order to consider the spirit of the\u00a0 Civil Code, nothing is more logical than to establish a comparison between an action to claim the legitimacy, and one to enforce acknowledgment.<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 118.\u00a0 The action to claim its legitimacy may be brought by the child at any time of its lifetime and shall be transmitted to its heirs, should it die during minority or in a state of insanity.\u00a0\u00a0 In such cases the heirs shall be allowed a period of five years in which to institute the action.<br\/><br\/>\"The action already instituted by the child is transmitted by its death to the heirs, if it has not lapsed before then.<br\/><br\/>\"ART. 137.\u00a0 The actions for the acknowledgment of natural children can be instituted <i>only<\/i> during the life of the presumed parents, except in the following cases :<br\/><br\/>\"1.\u00a0 If the father or mother died during the minority of the child, in which, case <i>the latter<\/i> may institute the action before the expiration of the first four years of its majority.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 If, after the death of the father or mother, some instrument, before unknown, should be discovered in which the child is expressly acknowledged. <br\/><br\/>\u00a0\"In this case the action must be instituted within the six months following the discovery of such instrument\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On this supposition\u00a0 the first difference that results between one action and the other consists in that the right of action for legitimacy lasts during the whole lifetime of the child, that is, it can always be brought against the presumed parents or their heirs by the child itself, while the right of action for the acknowledgment of a natural child does not last his whole lifetime, and, as a general rule, it can not be instituted against the heirs of the presumed parents, inasmuch as it can be exercised <i>only<\/i> during the life\u00a0 of the presumed parents.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the question at issue, that is, the transmission to the heirs of the presumed parents of the obligation to admit the legitimate filiation, or to recognize the natural filiation, there exists the most radical difference in that the former continues during the life of the child who claims to be legitimate, and he may demand it either directly and primarily from the said presumed parents, or indirectly and secondarily from the heirs of the latter; while the second does not endure for life; as a general rule, it <i>only<\/i> lasts during the life of the presumed parents.\u00a0 Hence the other difference, derived as a consequence, that an action for legitimacy is always brought against the heirs of the presumed parents in case of the death of the latter, while the action for acknowledgment is not brought against the heirs of such parents, with the exception of the two cases prescribed by article 137 transcribed above.<br\/><br\/>So much for the passive transmission of the obligation to admit the legitimate filiation, or to acknowledge the natural filiation.<br\/><br\/>As to the transmission to the heirs of the child of the <i>latter's<\/i> action to claim his legitimacy, or to obtain the acknowledgment of his natural filiation, it is seen that the code grants it in the first case, but not in the second.\u00a0 It contains provisions for the transmission of the right of action which, for the purpose of claiming his legitimacy inheres in the Child, but it does not say a word with regard to the transmission of the right to obtain the acknowledgment of the natural filiation.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the respective corollary of each of the two above-cited articles is:\u00a0 (1) That the right of action which devolves upon the\u00a0 child to claim his legitimacy under article 118, may be\u00a0 transmitted to his heirs in certain cases designated in the said article; (2) That the right of action for the acknowledgment of natural children to which article 137 refers, can never be transmitted, for the reason that the code makes no mention of it in any case, not even as an exception.<br\/><br\/>It is most illogical arid contrary to every rule of correct interpretation, that the right of action to secure acknowledgment by the natural child should be presumed to be transmitted, independently, as a rule, to his heirs, while the right of action to claim legitimacy from his predecessor is not expressly, independently, or, as a general rule, conceded to the heirs of the legitimate child, but only relatively and as an exception.\u00a0 Consequently, the pretension that the right of action on the part of the child to obtain the acknowledgment of his natural filiation is transmitted to his descendants is altogether unfounded.\u00a0 No legal provision exists to sustain such pretension, nor can an argument of presumption be based on the lesser claim when there is no basis for the greater one, and when it is only given as an exception in well-defined cases.\u00a0 It is placing the heirs of the natural child on a better footing than the heirs of the legitimate one, when, as a matter of fact, the position of a natural child is no better than, nor even equal to, that of a legitimate child.<br\/><br\/>From the express and precise precepts of the code the following conclusions are derived:<br\/><br\/>The right of action that devolves upon the child to claim his legitimacy lasts during his whole life, while the right to claim the acknowledgment of a natural child lasts only during the life of his presumed parents.<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as the right of action accruing to the child to claim his legitimacy lasts during his whole life, he may exercise it either against the presumed parents, or their heirs; while the right of action to secure the acknowledgment of a natural child, since it does not last during his whole life, but depends on that of the presumed parents, as a general rule can only be exercised against the latter.<br\/><br\/>Usually the right of action for legitimacy devolving upon the child is of a personal character and pertains exclusively to him, only the child may exercise it at any time during his lifetime.\u00a0 As an exception, and in three cases only, it may be transmitted to the heirs of the child, to wit, if he died during his minority, or\u00a0 while insane, or after action had been already instituted.<br\/><br\/>An action for the acknowledgment of a natural child may, as an exception, be exercised against the heirs of the presumed parents in two cases:\u00a0 first, in the event of the death of the latter during the minority of the child, and second, upon the discovery of some instrument, of express acknowledgment of the child, executed by the father or mother, the existence of which was unknown during the life of the latter.<br\/><br\/>But such action for the acknowledgment of a natural child can only be exercised by <i>him<\/i>.\u00a0 It can not be transmitted to his descendants, or to his ascendants.<br\/><br\/>In support of the foregoing the following authorities may be cited:<br\/><br\/>Sanchez Roman, in his Treatise on Civil Law, propounds the question as to whether said action should be considered transmissive to the heirs or descendants of the natural child, whether he had or had not exercised it up to the time of his death, and decides it as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"There is an entire absence of legal provisions, and at most, it might be deemed admissible as a solution, that the right of action to claim the acknowledgment of a natural child is transmitted by analogy to his heirs on the same conditions and terms that it is transmitted to the descendants of a legitimate child, to claim his legitimacy, under article 118, but nothing more; because on this point nothing warrants placing the heirs of a natural child on a better footing than those of the legitimate child, and even to compare them <i>would not fail to be a strained and questionable matter,<\/i> and one of great <i>difficulty for decision<\/i> by the courts, for the simple reason that for the heirs of the legitimate child, the said article 118 exists, while for those of the natural child, as we have said, there is no provision in the code authorizing the same, although on the other hand there is none that prohibits it.\"\u00a0 (Vol. V.) <\/blockquote> Diaz Guijarro and Martinez Ruiz in their work on \"The Civil Code as construed by the supreme court of Spain,\" commenting upon article 137, say:<br\/><blockquote>\"Article 118, taking into account the privileges due to the legitimacy of children, grants them the right to claim said legitimacy during their lifetime, and even authorizes the transmission of said right for the space of five years to the heirs thereof, if the child die during his minority or in a state of insanity.\u00a0 But as article 137 is based on the consideration that in the case of a natural child, ties are less strong and sacred in the eyes of the law, it does not fix such a long and indefinite period for the exercise of the action; it limits it to the life of the parents, excepting in the two cases mentioned in said article; and <i>it does not allow<\/i>, as does article 118, the <i>action to pass on<\/i> to the heirs, inasmuch as, although it does not prohibit it, and for that reason it might be deemed on general principles of law to consent to it, <i>such a supposition is inadmissible<\/i> for the reason that a comparison of both articles shows that the silence of the law in the latter case is not, nor can it be, an omission, but a deliberate intent to establish a wide difference between the advantages granted to a legitimate child and to a natural one.\" <\/blockquote> (Ibid., Vol. II, 171.)<br\/><br\/>Navarro Amandi (<i>Cuestionario del Codigo Civil<\/i>) raises the question:\u00a0 \"Can the heirs of a natural child claim the acknowledgment in those cases wherein the father or mother are under obligation to acknowledge\"?\u00a0 And says:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Opinions are widely divergent.\u00a0 The court of Rennes held (on April 13, 1844) that the right of investigation forms a part of the estate of the child, and along with his patrimony is transmitted to his heirs.\u00a0 The affirmation is altogether too categorical to be admissible.\u00a0 If it were correct the same thing would happen as when the legitimacy of a child is claimed, and as already seen, the right of action to demand the legitimacy is not transmitted to the heirs in every case and as an absolute right, but under certain limitations and circumstances.\u00a0 Now, were we to admit the doctrine of the court of Rennes, the result would be that the claim for natural filiation would be more favored than one for legitimate filiation.\u00a0 This would be absurd, because it can not be conceived that the legislator should have granted a right of action to the heirs of the natural child, which is only granted under great limitations and in very few cases to those of a legitimate one.\u00a0 Some persons insist that the same rules that govern legitimate filiation apply by analogy to natural filiation, and that in this conception the heirs of the natural child are entitled to claim it in the cases prescribed by article 118.\u00a0 The majority, however, are inclined to consider the right to claim acknowledgment as a personal right, and consequently, not transmissive to the heirs.\u00a0 Really there are no legal grounds to warrant the transmission.\"\u00a0 (Vol. 2, 229.) <\/blockquote> In a decision like the present one it is impossible to bring forward the argument of analogy for the purpose of considering that the heirs of the natural child are entitled to the right of action which article 118 concedes to the heirs of the legitimate child.\u00a0 The existence of a provision for the one case and the absence thereof for the other is a conclusive argument that <i>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius<\/i>, and it can not be understood that the provision of law should be the same when the same reason does not hold in the one case as in the other.<br\/><br\/>The theory of the law of transmission is also entirely inapplicable in this case.\u00a0 This theory, which in the Roman Law expressed the general rule that an heir who did not accept an inheritance during his lifetime was incapacitated from transmitting it to his own heirs, included at the same time the idea that if the inheritance was not transmitted because the heir did not possess it, there were, however, certain things which the heir held arid could transmit.\u00a0 Such was the law and the right to accept the inheritance, tot the existing reason that all rights, both real and personal, shall pass to the heir; <i>quia haeres representat defunctum in omnibus et per omnia<\/i>.\u00a0 According to article 659 of the Civil Code, \"the inheritance includes all the property, rights, and obligations of a person, which are not extinguished by his death.\"\u00a0 If the mother is the heir of her natural child, and the latter, among other rights during his lifetime was entitled to exercise an action for his acknowledgment against his father, during the life of the latter, or after his death in some of the excepting cases of article 137, such right, which is a portion of his inheritance, is transmitted to his mother as being his heir, and it was so understood by the court of Rennes when it considered the right in question, not as a personal and exclusive right of the child which is extinguished by his death, but as any other right which might be transmitted after his death.\u00a0 This\u00a0 right of supposed transmission is even less tenable than that Sought to be sustained by the argument of analogy.<br\/><br\/>The right of action pertaining to the child to claim his legitimacy is in all respects superior to that of the child who claims acknowledgment as a natural child.\u00a0 And it is evident that the right of action to claim his legitimacy is not one of those rights which the legitimate child may transmit by inheritance to his heirs; it forms no part of the component rights of his inheritance.\u00a0 If it were so, there would have been no necessity to establish its transmissibility to heirs as an exception in the terms and conditions of article 118 of the code.\u00a0 So that, in order that it may constitute a portion of the child's inheritance, it is necessary that the conditions and the terms contained in article 118 shall be present, since without them, the right that the child held during his lifetime, being personal and exclusive in principle, and therefore, as a general rule not susceptible of transmission, would and should have been extinguished by his death.\u00a0 Therefore, where no express provision like that of article 118 exists, the right of action for the acknowledgment of a natural child is, in principle and without exception, extinguished by his death, and can not be transmitted, as a portion of the inheritance of the deceased child.<br\/><br\/>On the\u00a0 other hand, if said right of action formed a part of the child's inheritance, it would be necessary to establish the doctrine that the right to claim such an acknowledgment from the presumed natural father and from\u00a0 his heirs is an absolute right of the heirs of the child, not limited by certain circumstances as in the case of the heirs of a legitimate child; and if it is unreasonable to compare a natural child with a legitimate one to place the heirs of a natural child and his inheritance on a better\u00a0 footing than those of a legitimate child would not only be unreasonable, but, as stated in one of the above citations, most absurd and illegal in the present state of the law and in accordance with the general principles thereof.<br\/><br\/>For all of the foregoing reasons we hereby reverse the judgment appealed from in all its parts, without any special ruling as to the costs of this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Mapa, Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">DISSENTING<\/span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\/><\/div><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">TORRES, J.,<\/span><br\/><br\/>The questions arising from the facts and points of law discussed in this litigation between the parties thereto, decided in the judgment appealed from, and set up and discussed in this instance by the said parties in their respective briefs, are subordinate in the first place to the main point, submitted among others to the decision of this court, that is, whether the right of action brought to demand from the natural father, or from his heirs, the acknowledgment of the natural child which the former left at his death was, by operation of the law, transmitted to the natural mother by reason of the death of the said child acknowledged by her.<br\/><br\/>The second error assigned by the appellant in his brief refers exclusively to this important point of law.<br\/><br\/>Article 846 of the Civil Code prescribes:<br\/><blockquote>\"The right of succession which the law grants natural children extends reciprocally in similar cases to the natural father or mother.\" <\/blockquote> Article 944 reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"If the acknowledged natural or legitimized child should die without issue, either legitimate or acknowledged by it, the father or mother who acknowledged it shall succeed to its entire estate, and if both acknowledged it and are alive, they shall inherit from it share and share alike.\" <\/blockquote> It can not be inferred from the above legal provisions that from the right of succession which the law grants the natural father or mother upon the,death of their natural child, the right of the heirs of any of the said parents to claim the acknowledgment of the natural child is excluded.\u00a0 No article is to be found in the Civil Code that expressly provides for such exclusion or elimination of the right of the heirs of the deceased child to claim his acknowledgment.<br\/><br\/>If under article 659 of said code, the inheritance includes all the property, rights, and obligations of a person, which are not extinguished by his death, it is unquestionable that among such rights stands that which the natural child had, while alive, to claim his acknowledgment as such from his natural father, or from the heirs of the latter.\u00a0 There is no reason or legal provision whatever to prevent the consideration that the right to claim acknowledgment of the filiation of a deceased child from his natural father, or from the heirs of the latter, is included in the hereditary succession of the deceased child in favor of his natural mother.<br\/><br\/>It is to\u00a0 be regretted that such an eminent writer as Manresa is silent on this special point, or that he is not very explicit in his comments on article 137 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 Among the various noted writers on law, Professor Sanchez Roman is the only one who has given his opinion in a categorical manner as to whether or not the right of action for the acknowledgment of a deceased natural child shall be considered transmissive to his heirs, as may be seen from the following:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"In order to complete the explanation of this article 137 of the Civil Code, three points must be decided:\u00a0 (1) Against whom shall an action for acknowledgment be brought under the cases and terms to which the two exceptions indicated in paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 137 refer?\u00a0 (2) Who is to represent the\u00a0 minor in bringing this action when neither the father nor the mother has acknowledged him?\u00a0 (3) Should this right of action be considered as transmitted to the heirs or descendants of the natural child whether or not it was exercised at the time of his death?<br\/><br\/>\"With respect to the third, there is an entire absence of legal provisions, and at most, it might be deemed admissible as a solution, that the right of action to claim the acknowledgment of a natural child is transmitted by analogy to his heirs on the same conditions and terms that it is transmitted to the descendants of the legitimate child, to claim his legitimacy, under article 118, but no more; because on this point nothing warrants placing the heirs of a natural child oh a better footing than those of the legitimate child, and even to compare them would not fail to be a strained and questionable matter, and one of great difficulty for decision by the courts, for the simple reason that for the heirs of the legitimate child the said article 118 exists, while for those of the natural child, as we have said, there is no provision in the code authorizing the same, although on the other hand there is none that prohibits it.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>Certainly there is no article in the Civil Code, or any special law\u00a0 that bars the transmission to the heirs of a natural child, particularly to his natural mother, of the right of action to claim the acknowledgment of said natural child from the heirs of his deceased natural father.<br\/><br\/>According to the above-cited article 944 of the Civil Code, the only persons designated to succeed to the intestate estate of a natural child who died during minority or without issue are is natural father or mother who acknowledged it; consequently if by operation of the law his parents are his legal successors or heirs, it is unquestionable that by reason of the child's death the property, rights, and obligations of the deceased minor were, as a matter of fact, transmitted to them, among which was the right to demand the acknowledgment of the said deceased natural child from the heirs of the deceased natural father or mother, respectively, on account of having enjoyed uninterruptedly the status of natural child of the said deceased parents.\u00a0 (Arts. 135 and 136, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>At the death of the children, Teopista in 1902, and Jose in 1908, during their minority, and after the death of their natural father which took place in 1899, the natural mother of the said minors, Paula Conde, succeeded them in all of their property and rights, among which must necessarily appear and be included the right of action to claim the acknowledgment of said two children from the heirs of Icasiano Abaya, their deceased natural father.\u00a0 There is no legal provision or precept whatever excluding such right from those which, by operation of the law, were transmitted to the mother, Paula Conde, or expressly declaring that the said right to claim such acknowledgment is extinguished by the death of the natural children.<br\/><br\/>It is true that, as a general rule, an action for acknowledgment can not be brought by a surviving natural child after the death of his parents, except in the event that he was a minor at the time of the death of either of his parents, as was the case with the minors Teopista and Jose Conde, who, if living, would unquestionably be entitled to institute an action for acknowledgment against the presumed heirs of their natural father; and as there is no law that provides that said right is, extinguished by the death of the same, and that the mother did not inherit; it from the said minors, it is also unquestionable that Paula Conde, the natural mother and successor to the rights of said minors, is entitled to exercise the corresponding action for acknowledgment.<br\/><br\/>If the natural mother had no right of action against the heirs of\u00a0 the natural father, for the acknowledgment of her natural child, the unlimited and unconditional reciprocity established by article 846 of the code would neither be true nor correct.\u00a0 It should be noticed that the relation of paternity and that of filiation between the above-mentioned father and children are both natural in character; therefore, the intestate succession of the said children of Paula Conde is governed exclusively by articles 944 and 945 of the said code.<br\/><br\/>It is true that nothing is provided by article 137 with reference to the transmission to the natural mother of the right to claim the acknowledgment of her natural children, but, as Sanchez Roman says, it does not expressly prohibit it; and as opposed to the silence of the said article, we find the provisions of articles 846 and 944 of the Civil Code, which expressly recognize the right of the natural mother to succeed her natural child, a right which is transmitted to her by operation of law from the moment that the child ceases to exist.<br\/><br\/>The question herein does not bear upon the right of a child to claim his legitimacy, as provided in article 118 of the code, nor is it claimed that the rights of natural children and of their mother are\u00a0 equal to those of legitimate ones, even by analogy.<br\/><br\/>The foundations of this opinion are based solely on the provisions of the above-mentioned articles of the code, and I consider that they are sustainable so long as it is not positively proven that the so often-mentioned right of action for acknowledgment is extinguished by the death of the minor natural child, and is not transmitted to the natural mother by express declaration or prohibition of the law, together with the property and other rights in the intestate succession.<br\/><br\/>In view of the considerations above set forth it is my opinion that it should be held:\u00a0 That Paula Conde, as the natural mother and sole heir of her children Teopista and Jose, was and is entitled to the right to institute proceedings to obtain the acknowledgment of the latter as natural children of the late Icasiano Abaya, from Roman Abaya, as heir and administrator of the estate of the said Icasiano Abaya; and that the said Teopista and Jose who died during their minority, three years after the death of their father, should be considered and acknowledged as such natural children of the latter, for the reason that while living they uninterruptedly enjoyed the status of his natural children.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from should be affirmed without any special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the declaration that the property of the late Icasiano, which Paula Conde might take, are of a reservable character, together with the other matter contained in the third error assigned by the appellant to the said judgment, the writer withholds his opinion until such time as the question may be raised between the parties in proper form.<br\/><\/div>",

SANTIAGO TRILLANA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 15th of January, 1904, Manuel Ormachea Tin-Congco, a Chinaman, presented an amended complaint against Santiago Trillana, alleging that the plaintiff Ormachea and Luis Vizmanos Ong Queco were engaged in business in the pueblos of Hagonoy, Malolos, and other places in the Province of Bulacan, and that in the course thereof the defendant purchased from them merchandise to the value of 4,000 pesos, local currency; that two years prior to that date, a little more or less, the partnership was dissolved and the business was divided up between the partners, all accounts and debts of the defendant were allotted to the plaintiff, and became the individual property of Ormachea Tin-Congco; the indebtedness is proven by the documents signed by the defendant or his agents in favor of Ormachea or of Vizmanos Ong Queco or their agent named Lawa in charge of the business.\u00a0 The documents of indebtedness are inserted in the complaint and duly numbered.\u00a0 They aggregate 135 documents, some of which are written in Tagalog with their corresponding translations; that the legal interest on the said 4,000 pesos is 1,500 pesos which makes the total debt amount to 5,500 pesos, and the same has not been paid by the defendant.\u00a0 Therefore, the plaintiff prays that judgment be entered ordering the defendant, Santiago Trillana, to pay the said 5,500 pesos with costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendant filed a written answer on November 15, 1904, setting forth:\u00a0 That he admitted the first statement of the complaint, but had no knowledge as to the second as it appears therein; that he did not admit the same, nor the other allegations in the complaint in the sense in which they are set out; that as a special defense, the defendant alleges that he had already settled his accounts and obligations contracted in the business to which the complaint refers, by means of periodical payments in <i>tuba<\/i> or the liquor of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">nipa <\/span>palm, and that if any accounts are still pending, the same should, owing to their character and the manner in which they were constituted, be paid in kind and not in money as the plaintiff claims in his complaint, and should be paid at the time and under the circumstances which, as is customary in Hagonoy, such class of obligations are settled; he therefore asked the court below to enter judgment absolving the defendant of the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence presented by the parties, the trial judge, on February 27,1907, rendered judgment ordering the defendant, Santiago Trillana, to pay to the Chinaman Florentino Tiu\u00a0 Tusay, the judicial administrator of the estate of the deceased plaintiff, Ormachea Tin-Congco, the sum of P2,832.22, in <i>tuba<\/i>, under the same conditions stipulated between the debtor and the copartnership for the working of the distillery of Luis Vizmanos and the late Chinaman Manuel Ormachea, with costs.<br\/><br\/>The representative of the defendant excepted to the above judgment, and announced his intention to appeal by means of a bill of exceptions; and by a writing dated March 22, 1907, he prayed the\u00a0 lower court to revoke or amend its former decision of the 27th of February, and to order a new trial as the evidence adduced at the hearing was not sufficient to justify said decision, because the <i>vale<\/i> No. 88 is subscribed by another person who is not the defendant, and for said reason its value can not be demanded from him; that <i>vales<\/i> numbered 31, 87, 91, 93, 94, 96, and 97 are in the same condition; that the <i>vales<\/i> Nos. 5, 6, 7, 32, 33, 35, 40, 41, 44, 48, 54, 63, 104, 105, 127, 132, and 133 offered by the plaintiff in evidence and signed by the defendant, clearly express on whose account they were issued, and\u00a0 for said reason the obligations contained in said <i>vales<\/i> are\u00a0 not those of the defendant, Santiago Trillana, and can not stand as evidence against him; that the <i>vales<\/i> Nos. 109,112,113,115, 116,118,12, and 15 by themselves do not prove, nor can they prove that the amount of money which they represent should form part of the defendant's debt, because it does not appear that there was ever a lawful transfer, cession or indorsement made between the person in whose favor they are made out and the so-called creditor, nor between said person and the successor of the said entity, that is to say, the representative of the plaintiff; that <i>vale<\/i> No. 113\u00a0 is made out as a mere recommendation of the defendant, and for account of a third person; that <i>vale<\/i> No. 1 does not state the year, and No. 135 bears no date at ail, therefore, they do not constitute sufficient proof to justify the condemnatory judgment with respect to the amount which they represent, because the time when said respective obligations were contracted is not determined; that the vales which are dated previously to <i>vale<\/i> No. 98 are invalidated by the note of general liquidation between the creditor Manuel Ormachea, and the debtor Santiago Trillana written on the back of the said <i>vale<\/i> No. 98 in Chinese characters and explained by the witness Jose R. Lopez Lawa, and, nothwithstanding said liquidation, the said <i>vales<\/i> are reputed as unpaid; and finally, that if the debt is payable in <i>tuba<\/i>, unless it is shown and it does not so appear that the defendant refused to pay it in that manner or has failed to comply with his obligations, there is no reason to compel him to pay, therefore he should not be ordered to do so, much less to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>At the hearing, the trial judge, on the 7th of May, 1907, overruled the motion to modify his former decision as far as it referred to the amount of the indebtedness found against the defendant and the said judgment was modified by adding the provision that the defendant should make payment in <i>tuba<\/i> which he should deliver at the plaintiff's distillery in the town of Hagonoy within the term of six months, but that, if said term should expire without such payment, whatever might be the cause,\u00a0 he should\u00a0 be obliged to pay his debt in cash.<br\/><br\/>The defendant requested a decision in his motion for a new trial in which he contended that the evidence was not sufficient to justify the judgment of February 27, and on the 12th of November the court below held that, by its order of May 7, last, the motion for a new trial was denied, and said denial was reproduced as explanation of the ruling of May 7.\u00a0 The defendant excepted to the foregoing decision and presented the corresponding amended bill of exceptions; when approving the bill of exceptions, the court below ordered the suspension of the execution providing that the defendant furnish bond in the sum of P4,000.<br\/><br\/>As Manuel Ormachea Tin-Congco claimed from Santiago Trillana the payment of the sum which, as capital and interest thereon, he owed the former for amounts in cash and in goods which he took from the creditor and his partner, Luis Vizmanos Ong Queco, as shown by the 135 <i>vales<\/i> which are attached to the complaint and which were admitted as authentic by the defendant, with the exception of eight of them signed by other persons, aggregating P173, the court below, in view of the evidence, found that the debt which could be claimed from the defendant, after deducting the said P173, amounted only to P2,832.22 4\/8.<br\/><br\/>The record shows that the amounts advanced to the debtor, Santiago\u00a0 Trillana, and to others by means of the said <i>vales<\/i>, most of which were\" addressed to Lopez Lawa, and some to other persons, were delivered by the said Lopez Lawa who, from the years 1894 or 1895 to 1901, was the manager of the distillery situated in the\u00a0 barrio of San Sebastian, municipality of Hagonoy, Bulacan, and owned in partnership,by Ormachea and Vizmanos, but that the money furnished by the\u00a0 manager to Trillana and to the others on account of the <i>tuba<\/i> or liquor of the <i>nipa<\/i> palm which the defendant had engaged to supply to said distillery, belonged to the two owners of the same, not to the manager, Jose Lopez Lawa.<br\/><br\/>It has also been fully proven that, when in June or July, 1901, the aforesaid Ormachea Tin-Congco and Vizmanos Ong Queco withdrew from the business, Lawa ceased to act as manager of the distillery, and then, among other things that belonged to the two partners, they divided between them the credits that they held against third persons, those that stood against Santiago Trillana as evidenced by the said 135 <i>vales<\/i>, having gone to Manuel Ormachea Tin-Congco.\u00a0 This is affirmed by Luis Vizmanos Ong Queco, Syo Bunchad, by Jose R. Lopez Lawa himself, and, as stipulated between the parties, by Tiu Langco, a Chinaman who was at the time employed as mixer in said distillery.\u00a0 It should be noted that, while this litigation was pending, the plaintiff, Manuel\u00a0 Ormachea, died, and Florentino Tiu Tusay was appointed administrator of his estate; letters of administration in favor of the latter were issued on the 9th of October, 1905.\u00a0 (Folio 56.)<br\/><br\/>As has been seen, the defendant stated that he had already<br\/><br\/>paid his accounts and obligations contracted in favor of the said Ormachea and Vizmanos by means of periodical deliveries of <i>tuba<\/i> or liquor of the <i>nipa<\/i> palm, and alleged that, if any amount was still pending payment, it should be paid not in monjsy but in <i>tuba<\/i>, at such time and under such circumstances as are customary in the town of Hagonoy.\u00a0 In evidence of this, while testifying under oath, he introduced the following document marked \"A\" which appears at folio 248:<br\/><blockquote>\"I, Jose R. Lopez (Lawa), a Christian Chinese, do hereby declare that D. Santiago Trillana has no outstanding debt whatever with the distillery situated in the barrio of San Sebastian in this town, which in past times was under my management, what I have stated is the truth.-Hagonoy, November 19, 1903.-Jose R. Lopez.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The debtor explained how and in what manner he obtained the foregoing document from Lawa, and stated:\u00a0 That in November, 1903, he received a letter from\u00a0 Mr. McGirr, the plaintiff's attorney, requesting him to settle his account with Lawa, for which reason he called on the latter and asked him whether he still owed him anything on account of the distillery in San Sebastian; Lawa replied that he no longer owed anything; thereupon he requested Lawa to issue the said document, and under Lawa's direction the debtor wrote out the document, and the former, upon being informed of its contents, signed it; for said reason the witness believed that he no longer owed anything.<br\/><br\/>However, Lopez Lawa affirms that he gave the said document marked as \"Exhibit A\" to the debtor, Santiago Trillana, because the latter was not indebted to him but to Manuel Ormachea, to whom the credits standing against Trillana were transferred when Ormachea withdrew from the above-mentioned partnership with Vizmanos Ong Queco.\u00a0 When drawing up the preinserted document,\u00a0 it was not his intention to annul and set aside the <i>vales<\/i> which represented the indebtedness of the defendant, Trillana.<br\/><br\/>If the business jointly carried on by Ormachea and Vizmanos was dissolved, and its transactions\u00a0 ceased in 1901, Jose Lopez Lawa,\u00a0 who managed the distillery on behalf of the owners of the same, also ceased to act as such manager in said year, and for said reason the document Exhibit A, which he issued to the debtor on the 19th of November, 1903, two years after ceasing to be manager, can not serve to relieve the debtor from paying what he owed by virtue of the documents or <i>vales<\/i> that he had issued in order to obtain money from the owners of the said distillery; that is to say, as agreed upon by them, the right to recover the debts of the defendant still belonged to Ormachea when the business was dissolved, as Lawa was not authorized by Ormachea to deliver to the debtor an acquittance releasing him from the obligations that he had contracted, to the prejudice of the real creditor, the only person entitled to condone a debt in the event of waiving the right to recover the same.<br\/><br\/>If the document marked \"A\" had been issued by Jose Lopez Lawa while still at the head of the business of the distillery, as representative of the owners thereof, the aforesaid Ormachea and Vizmanos, prior to their withdrawal from business, perhaps it might have served as a foundation for the debtor to allege that his obligations evidenced by said <i>vales<\/i> had been settled, although, if such was the case, the said <i>vales<\/i> should have been returned to him by Lawa, of by the owners of the distillery; but, as the document was made out and issued two years afterwards, without a previous payment of the amounts secured on the said <i>vales<\/i>, when the business no longer existed, when the owners had entirely withdrawn from it, and when Lawa, who then acted as manager of the distillery, had no express authority to issue such a document, with the further circumstance of its being written in Spanish, a language with which the Chinaman who signed it was probably not well acquainted and the fact that it was written by the defendant, Santiago Trillana himself; it is not proper nor lawful to admit the said document as possessing a force and effect that would fully exempt the defendant from the payment of his obligation, and with greater reason if it is considered that it has not been shown that Lawa was authorized to liquidate accounts, or to issue an acquittance releasing the debtor from the payment of his debt.\u00a0 (Arts. 1714 and 1719, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Article 1162 of said code reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Payment must be made to the person in whose favor an obligation is constituted, or to another authorized to receive it in his name.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>After the close of the business of the distillery owned by Ormachea and Vizmanos, and after Lawa had ceased for two years to act in the administration and management thereof, he was not authorized to sign the document marked \"A,\" made out by the debtor, by which the credit of Ormachea should be considered as settled, and the obligation contracted by Santiago Trillana, as shown by the <i>vales<\/i> which appear in the record, extinguished.<br\/><br\/>Since the <i>vales<\/i> existed, and were in the possession of the creditor, it was because the amounts they called for had not yet been paid, inasmuch as an obligation can only be presumed to have been fulfilled when the proofs of its existence have been returned to the debtor.\u00a0 (Sec. 834, par. 8, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>Seeing that the amounts stated in the <i>vales<\/i> acknowledged by the debtor were advanced\u00a0 to him in part payment of the price of certain quantities of <i>tuba<\/i> or liquor of the <i>nipa<\/i> palm which he had contracted to deliver at the distillery, and as long as he is able to comply with these stipulations within a reasonable time, the defendant can not be compelled to pay his debt in cash.\u00a0 The amounts stated in the <i>vales<\/i> were advanced under the condition that the same would be paid or satisfied with the value of the <i>tuba<\/i> received by the distillery; therefore, the decision of the court below, which moreover appears to have been acquiesced in by the appellee for the reason that it was undoubtedly so stipulated, is in accordance with the law.\u00a0 (Art. 1278, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, and accepting the conclusions contained in the judgment of February 27, 1907, appealed from, it is our opinion that the same should be affirmed, and we hereby affirm it, with the addition made in the order of May 7 of the same year, with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,, C.

all contrary to law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>After hearing the evidence, the lower court found the defendants guilty of the crime charged in the complaint, and expressly finding that there were no aggravating circumstances, and applying the provisions of article 11 of the Penal Code as an extenuating circumstance, sentenced the defendant Wenceslao Mercado to be imprisoned in the provincial jail of the Province of Ambos Camarines for a period of eight months of <i>prision correccional<\/i> and to pay one-half of the costs, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment for the payment of said costs at the rate of 12\u00bd pesetas per day.\u00a0 The lower court sentenced the said Vicenta Rey to be banished from the territory surrounding the barrio of Manangle, jurisdiction of Sipocot, of the Province of Ambos Camarines, within a radius of 25 kilometers, for a period of six months and one day, and to pay one-half the costs, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary banishment at the rate of 12\u00bdpesetas per day, for the payment of one-half of the\u00a0 costs.<br\/><br\/>From this sentence of the lower court the defendants appealed, making one assignment of error only, to wit, that the lower court committed an error in declaring the defendants guilty of the crime of adultery.<br\/><br\/>From a reading of the above complaint, it will be noted that the defendants were charged with the violation of the provisions of article 437 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 An examination of the record brought to this court discloses the following facts:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That Maria Aureus and\u00a0 Wenceslao Mercado were married in the Province of Ambos Camarines on the 3d day of February, 1883; that the said marriage had never been annulled.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That some time before the time of the alleged commission of the crime charged in the complaint, the said Maria Aureus and her husband, Wenceslao Mercado, had separated and were living apart.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 That some time before the said separation of Aureus and her husband Mercado, the husband (Wenceslao Mercado) had employed the\u00a0 defendant, Vicenta Rey, and her husband to work for him, and that they (Vicenta Rey and her husband) had continued in his employment until the death of the husband of the said Vicenta Rey.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 The accused, Vicenta Rey, continued to live in the house of the defendant Mercado after the separation of the latter from his wife and after the death of her husband.<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 The evidence shows, beyond peradventure of doubt, that the\u00a0 defendants at\u00a0 various times and for a great many months committed the acts described in the complaint presented against them in the lower court.\u00a0 We find, therefore, that they are guilty of the crime charged in said complaint beyond peradventure of doubt.<br\/><br\/>The lower court found that there were no aggravating circumstances.\u00a0 With this finding we agree.\u00a0 The lower court gave the\u00a0 defendants the benefit of the provisions of article 11 as an extenuating circumstance.\u00a0 We do not believe, and so hold, that it was the intention of the Legislature that the provisions of article 11 should be extended to the persons named therein for crimes of the character with which these defendants are here charged.\u00a0 There being, therefore, neither aggravating nor extenuating circumstances, the penalty imposed should be in the medium degree of <i>prision correccional<\/i>.\u00a0 (See art. 437, Penal Code.)<br\/><br\/>The sentence of the lower court is, therefore, hereby modified and the defendant Wenceslao Mercado is hereby sentenced to be imprisoned for the period of two years of <i>prision correccional<\/i> and to pay one-half the costs.\u00a0 The defendant Vicenta Rey is hereby sentenced to two years, four months, and one day of banishment from the barrio of Manangle, of the jurisdiction of Sipocot, of the Province of Ambos Camarines, and from the territory surrounding said barrio within a radius of 25 kilometers.\u00a0 The lower court imposed subsidiary imprisonment and banishment for the payment of costs.\u00a0 Subsidiary imprisonment or subsidiary banishment can not be imposed for costs in favor of the State.\u00a0 Articles 49, 50, and 51 of the Penal Code contain the provisions applicable to the imposition of the payment of costs and for subsidiary imprisonment, etc.<br\/><br\/>Article 49 provides the order of the payment of the pecuniary liability of the accused in criminal cases.<br\/><br\/>Article 50 contains the provisions with reference to the circumstances under which the accused may be required to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, etc., and for the nonpayment of some of these pecuniary liabilities.<br\/><br\/>Article 51 expressly mentions, by reference, the pecuniary liability for which a defendant may be required to suffer imprisonment.\u00a0 The costs incurred by the State are not included, and therefore subsidiary imprisonment can not be enforced for the payment of costs in favor of the State.\u00a0 Subsidiary imprisonment may be enforced for the payment of costs of a private accuser.\u00a0 Had the lower court rendered a judgment in the present case for costs incurred by a private accuser, he might have imposed subsidiary imprisonment for the payment of the same.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which shows that such a judgment was rendered.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the right to impose subsidiary imprisonment for the payment of costs, see 1 Viada 429-431;

Grant Trent, judge of said court, issued an order of execution, directing the sheriff to sell the property covered by the said mortgage.\u00a0 The mortgaged property, under said execution, was duly sold on the 10th day of April, 1908.<br\/><br\/>On the 14th of April, 1908, the\u00a0 plaintiff presented a motion in the lower court, asking that the said sale of the mortgaged property be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>On the 21st day of April, 1908, the defendant appeared in court and objected to the confirmation of the sale upon the ground that there was another person who would pay the sum of P5,500 for the property\u00a0 sold.\u00a0 The return of the sheriff shows that he sold the property for the sum of P4,715.\u00a0 The defendant in said motion requested that\u00a0 the property be put up and sold again.\u00a0 It will be noticed that the defendant appeared and objected to the confirmation of the sale eleven days after the sale had been consummated, and so far as the record discloses this was his first appearance during the pendency of the cause in the lower court.<br\/><br\/>On the 21st day of April, 1908, after duly considering the objection made by the defendant, the lower court over-ruled the said objection and confirmed the sale of said property.<br\/><br\/>To this ruling of the lower court the defendant duly excepted and later presented his bill of exceptions in this court.<br\/><br\/>In this court the appellant made the following assignments of error:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the court committed an error in confirming the sale of the mortgaged property; and<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That the lower court committed an error in adjudicating the said property to the purchaser.<br\/><br\/>These two assignments of error may be considered as one, to wit: that the lower court committed an error in confirming the sale of said mortgaged property.<br\/><br\/>Sections 254 to 261 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provide the method of foreclosing a mortgage upon real estate or the interest thereon.<br\/><br\/>Section 256 provides for trial and judgment in such actions.\u00a0 Section 257 provides for the sale of the mortgaged property in case the lower court renders a judgment ordering the sale.\u00a0 After the sale has been made by the sheriff, under the provisions of said last-named section, it is necessary to secure a decree of the court confirming such sale.\u00a0 Said section also provides that \"should the court decline to confirm the sale for good cause shown, and should set it aside, it shall order a resale in accordance with law.\"\u00a0 The lower court, in accordance with this provision has a right to confirm or to refuse to confirm the sale for good cause shown, and the single question presented in this court is whether or not the objection of the defendant to the confirmation of the sale constituted a sufficient cause for refusing to confirm such sale.<br\/><br\/>The basis of the objection of the defendant in the lower court was that he was able to obtain from another person about P800 more than the sheriff received from the person to whom he sold said property.\u00a0 This person was not discovered by the defendant until ten or twelve days after the sale took place.\u00a0 No objection is made by the defendant that the sale was not duly advertised or that there was any collusion on the part of the sheriff or the other parties interested in the sale.\u00a0 It is the duty of the court, of course, in the sale of property under the conditions of the present case, to obtain as much money for the judgment debtor out of his property as it is possible.\u00a0 This duty on the part of the court, however, does not justify negligent delay in an attempt to protect his rights on the part of the said judgment debtor.<br\/><br\/>In the present case the defendant made no attempt to defend his rights until some days after judgment, execution, and sale.\u00a0 The Supreme Court of the United States has held in numerous decisions, that a sale under foreclosure proceedings would not be set aside upon the ground that the sheriff did not receive as much money as he might have received, providing all of the proceedings were valid and regular, unless the sale was made for a sum grossly inadequate in comparison with the real value of the property.<br\/><br\/>A judicial sale of real estate will not be set aside for inadequacy\u00a0 of price unless the inadequacy be so great as to shock the conscience or unless there be additional circumstances against its fairness.\u00a0 (Graffam et al. <i>vs.<\/i> Burgess, 117 U.

VALERIANO VELOSO YAP-JUE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from a final order of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, in contempt proceedings prosecuted under the provisions of section 172 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 The principal case to which these proceedings are ancillary, was an action to enjoin infringement of a patented process for the manufacture of curved handles for canes, parasols, and umbrellas.\u00a0 In that case plaintiff established his title to a valid patent covering the process in question, and obtained against this defendant a judgment, granting a perpetual injunction restraining its infringement, which judgment was affirmed by this court on appeal (C Phil. Rep., 143.)\u00a0 The order was couched in the following terms:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is ordered that the defendant abstain from manufacturing canes and umbrellas with a curved handle by means of a lamp or blowpipe fed with mineral oil or petroleum, which process was protected by patent No. 19228, issued in favor of Henry Gsell, and by him transferred to Carlos Gsell\u2014 \"<br\/><\/blockquote>and the process therein mentioned is fully described in the following statement which accompanied the application for the patent:<br\/><blockquote>\"After the canes have been cut for cane or umbrella handles, the outsides are thoroughly cleaned.\u00a0 This operation having been performed, they are then trimmed and the interior cleaned by means of a gimlet of about 15 centimeters in length operated by a wheel, by means of which the knots inside are broken.\u00a0 There is then introduced to a depth of about 15 centimeters a piece, of very clean bamboo, which completely fills the hole made by the gimlet, thereby giving to the cane the necessary strength to resist the heat of the lamp or blowpipe without breaking or cracking.<br\/><br\/>\"This operation having been performed, the cane, the end of which is attached to a fixed point, is given the shape of a hook or some other form by means of fire and pressure.\u00a0 Once the cane has been shaped as desired, it is allowed to cool, and is then cleaned, varnished, and ornamented at will.<br\/><br\/>\"This industry requires skillful handiwork, owing to the great risk engendered by the treatment of such fragile material as a light cane. On the other hand, however, it affords large profits to the workman.<br\/><br\/>\"NOTE.-The patent applied for shall be for the industrial product 'cane handles for walking sticks and umbrellas, curved by means of a small lamp or blowpipe, fed by petroleum or mineral fuel.'\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Thereafter the defendant continued to manufacture curved cane handles for walking sticks and umbrellas by a process in all respects identical with that used by the plaintiff under his patent, except only that he substituted for a lamp fed with petroleum or mineral oil, a lamp fed with alcohol, as appears from a stipulation entered into between plaintiff and defendant in the following terms:<br\/><blockquote>\"The plaintiff and defendant agree upon the fact that the defendant has used and is still using a process for curving handles of canes and umbrellas identical with that described in the application for the patent by the plaintiff with the exception that he has substituted for the lamp fed with oil another lamp fed with alcohol.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Contempt proceedings were instituted against the defendant in the month of February, 1904, the plaintiff in the original action alleging that the\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"Defendant in disobedience of the judgment of the same was and is now engaged in the unlawful manufacture of umbrella handles by the identical process described in and protected by said patent, No. 19228, or a process so like the patented process as to be indistinguishable.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The trial court found the defendant \"not guilty\" of contempt as charged; and this court, on appeal, held that\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"The violation, if there has been any, was not of such a character that it could be made patent by the mere annunciation of the acts performed by the defendant, which are alleged to constitute the said violation.\u00a0 These acts were not clearly and manifestly contrary to the precise terms of the prohibition.\u00a0 According to the express language of the judgment, the prohibition is against the manufacture of canes and umbrellas with curved handles, by means of the use of a <i>coal or mineral oil<\/i>-burning lamp or blowpipe and the parties have stipulated that the defendant did not use a coal or mineral oil-burning lamp but an <i>alcohol<\/i>-burning lamp.<br\/><br\/>\"The question, however, arises as to whether that prohibition included the substitution of alcohol for coal or mineral oil.\u00a0 In more abstract and general terms, the appellant propounds this question in his brief, as follows:\u00a0 The question presented by this appeal is whether or not the use of a patented process by a third person, without license or authority therefor, constitutes an infringement when the alleged infringer has substituted in lieu of some <i>unessential part<\/i> of the patented process a <i>well-known mechanical equivalent.'<\/i>\u00a0 It is seen that by its very terms this question implies in the present case the existence of two fundamental facts which must first be duly established, viz:\u00a0 (1) That the use of the lamp fed with petroleum or mineral oil was an unessential part of the patented process the use of which by the accused was prohibited by the said judgment; and (2) that alcohol is an equivalent and proper substitute, well known as such, for mineral oil or petroleum in connection with the said process.\u00a0 The appellant has failed to affirmatively establish either of these two essential facts.\u00a0 He has merely assumed their existence, without proving the same, thus begging the whole question.\u00a0 Consequently the contempt with which the accused is charged has not been fully and satisfactorily proved, and the order appealed from should accordingly be affirmed in so far as it holds that the defendant is not guilty of contempt.\"\u00a0 (7 Phil. Rep., 130.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Thereafter the plaintiff continued the use of the patented process, save only for the substitution of a lamp fed by alcohol for a lamp fed by petroleum or mineral oil, and new proceedings were instituted under the provisions of section 172 for the purpose of enforcing the original injunction above cited.\u00a0 Substantially the same question is submitted in these new proceedings as that submitted in the former case, but at the trial of this case testimony was introduced which, in our opinion, leaves no room for doubt, first, that alcohol is an equivalent or substitute, well known as such at the time when the patent was issued, for mineral oil or petroleum, in connection with blast lamps or blowpipes such as that which plaintiff uses in the patented process, and, second, that the use of a blast lamp or blowpipe fed with petroleum or mineral oil, rather than one fed with alcohol, is an unessential part of the patented process the use of which was prohibited by the said judgment<br\/><br\/>It was clearly proven at the trial, that kerosene and alcohol blast lamps are agencies for producing and applying heat, well known throughout the world long prior to 1906, the date of the issue of the patent; that it is and for many years has been known that one may for all ordinary purposes be used in the place of the other, and especially for the purpose of applying heat in the manner described in the patent; that the only consideration which determines the employment of one in place of the other is the convenience of the user and the question of relative cost; and that the principle upon which both lamps work is substantially identical, the only difference in\u00a0 construction being occasioned by the application of this principle to oils of different physical and chemical composition.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff does not and can not claim a patent upon the particular lamp used by him.\u00a0 The patent, however, gives.him the exclusive right to the use of \"la lamparilla o soplete, alimentada de petroleo o esencia mineral\" (the small lamp or blowpipe fed with petroleum or mineral oil)' in manufacturing curved handles for umbrellas and canes, to which reference is made in the above-cited descriptive statement and annexed note.\u00a0 \"The small lamp or blowpipe\" mentioned in the descriptive statement and annexed note which accompanied the application for the patent, evidently referred to the design of a blast lamp which was attached thereto; and in our opinion both plaintiff and defendant make use of a blast lamp substantially similar, in principle and design, to that referred to in the descriptive statement and the annexed note, for the exclusive use of which in the manufacture of curved handles, plaintiff holds a patent.\u00a0 True, defendant's blast lamp is fed with alcohol, and its shape varies in unimportant details, for the purpose of accommodating the principle, by which the flame is secured, to the different physical and chemical composition of the fuel used therein; but the principle on which it works, its mode of application, and its general design distinguish it in no essential particular from that used by the plaintiff.\u00a0 If the original design accompanying the statement had shown a blast lamp made of brass or delf, he would be a reckless advocate who would claim that the patent might lawfully be evaded by the use of a lamp made of iron or tin; or if the original design had shown a blast lamp 6 inches high, with a nozzle 4 inches long it would hardly be seriously contended that the use of a lamp 8 inches high with a nozzle 3 inches long would protect the ingenious individual, who in all other respects borrowed the patented process, from the consequences of an action for damages for infringement.\u00a0 But in the light of the evidence of record in this case, the reasoning upon which these hypothetical claims should be rejected applies with equal force to the contentions of the defendant, the ground for the rejection of the claims in each case being the same, and resting on the fact that unessential changes, which do not affect the principle of the blast lamp used in the patented process, or the mode of application of heat authorized by the patent, are not sufficient to support a contention that the process in one case is in any essential particular different from that used in the other.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for plaintiff invokes the doctrine of \"mechanical equivalents\" in support of his contention, and indeed that doctrine is strikingly applicable to the facts in this case.\u00a0 This doctrine is founded upon sound rules of reason and logic, and unless restrained or modified by law in a particular jurisdiction, is of universal application, so that it matters not whether a patent be issued by one sovereignty or another, the doctrine may properly be invoked to protect the patentee from colorable invasions of his patent under the guise of a substitution of some part of his invention by some well-known mechanical equivalent.\u00a0 Our attention has not been called to any provision of the patent law of Spain, which denies to patentees thereunder the just and equitable protection of the doctrine; and indeed a patent law which failed to recognize this doctrine would afford scant protection to inventors, for it is difficult if not impossible to conceive an invention, which is incapable of alteration or change in some unessential part, so as to bring that part outside of the express terms of any form of language which might be used in granting a patent for the invention; and as has been well said by counsel for plaintiff, human ingenuity would be taxed beyond its powers in preparing a grant of a patent so comprehensive in its terms, \"as to include within the express terms of its detailed description every possible alternative of form, size, shape, material, location, color, weight, etc., of every wheel, rod, bolt, nut, screw, plate, and other component parts of an invention.\"<br\/><br\/>The following citations from various decisions of the Federal Courts of the United States illustrate the application of the doctrine in that jurisdiction, and clearly point the way to the proper solution of the questions involved in the case at bar:<br\/><blockquote>\"Can the defendant have the right of infringement, by substituting in lieu of some of the parts of the combination well-known mechanical equivalents?\u00a0 I am quite clear that he can not, both on principle and authority.\u00a0 It is not to be disputed that the inventor of an ordinary machine is, by his letters patent, protected against all mere formal alterations and against the substitution of mere mechanical equivalents.\u00a0 Why should not the inventor of a new combination receive the same protection? If he can not, then will his patent not be worth the parchment on which it is written.<br\/><br\/><i>\"If no one can be held to infringe a patent for a combination unless he uses all the parts of the combination and the identical machinery as that of the patentee, then will no patent for a combination be infringed<\/i>; for certainly no one capable of operating a machine can be incapable of adopting some formal alteration in the machinery, or of substituting mechanical equivalents.\u00a0 No one infringes a patent for a combination who does not employ all of the ingredients of the combination; but if he employs all the ingredients, or adopts mere formal alterations, or substitutes for one ingredient another which was well known at the date of the patent as a proper substitute for the one withdrawn, and which performs substantially the same function as the one withdrawn, he does infringe.\"\u00a0 (King <i>vs<\/i>. Louisville Cement Co., Fed. Cas., 7798.)<br\/><br\/><i>\"Bona fide<\/i> inventors of a combination are as much entitled to equivalents as the inventors of other patentable improvements; by which is meant that a patentee in such a case may substitute another ingredient for any one of the ingredients of his invention, if the ingredient substituted performs the same function as the one omitted and was well known at the date of his patent as a proper substitute for the one omitted in the patented combination.\u00a0 Apply that rule and it is clear that an alteration in a patented combination which merely substitutes another old ingredient for one of the ingredients in the patented combination, is an infringement of the patent, if the substitute performs the same function and was well known at the date of the patent as a proper substitute for the omitted ingredient.\"\u00a0 (Gould <i>vs<\/i>. Rees, 82 U. S., 187, 194.)<br\/><br\/>\"Mere formal alterations in a combination in letters patent are no defense to the charge of infringement and the withdrawal of one ingredient from the same and the substitution of another which was well known at the date of the patent as a proper substitute for the one withdrawn is a mere formal alteration of the combination if the ingredient substituted performs substantially the same function as the one withdrawn.<br\/><br\/><i>\"Bona fide<\/i> inventors of a combination are as much entitled to suppress every other combination of the same ingredients to produce the same result, not substantially different from what they have invented and caused to be patented as any other class of inventors.\u00a0 All alike have the right to suppress every colorable invasion of that which is secured to them by letters patent.\" (Seymour <i>vs<\/i>. Osborne, 78 U. S., 516, 556.)<br\/><br\/>\"A claim for the particular means and mode of operation described in the specification extends, by operation of law, to the equivalent of such means-not equivalent simply because the same result is thereby produced-but equivalent as being substantially the same device in structure, arrangement and mode of operation.7' (Burden <i>vs<\/i>. Corning, Fed. Cas., 2143. Gottfried <i>vs<\/i>. Philip Best Brewing Co., Fed. Cas., 5633.)<br\/><br\/>\"An equivalent device is such as a mechanic of ordinary skill in construction of similar machinery, having the forms, specifications and machine before him, could substitute in the place of the mechanism described without the exercise of the inventive faculty.\"\u00a0 (Burden <i>vs<\/i>. Corning, <i>supra<\/i>.)<br\/><br\/>\"All the elements of the invention in this case are old, and the rule in such cases, as before explained, undoubtedly is, that a patentee can not invoke the doctrine of equivalents to suppress all other improvements of the old machine, but he is entitled to treat everyone as an infringer who makes, uses, or vends his patented improvement without any other change than the employment of a substitute for one of its elements, well known as such at the date of his invention, and which any constructor acquainted with the art will know how to employ.\u00a0 The reason for the qualification of the rule as stated is, that such change-that is, the mere substitution of a well-known element for another-where it appears that the substituted element was well known as a usual substitute for the element left out-is merely a formal one, and nothing better than a colorable evasion of the patent.\"\u00a0 (Union Sugar Refining Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Matthieson, Fed. Cas., 14399.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Counsel for defendant insists that, under Spanish law, none of the steps of the process described in the descriptive statement,\u00a0 save\u00a0 those mentioned in the \"note\" thereto attached are included in the patent, and that the patent rights secured thereunder are strictly limited to the precise language of the \"note\" attached to the descriptive statement; while counsel for plaintiff appears to think that the language of the patent covers any process or device whereby wood or cane may be bent or curved by the use of heat.\u00a0 But for the purpose of this decision it is not necessary to consider these questions, further than to hold, as\u00a0 we do, that under the doctrine of equivalents, the language of the note in the descriptive statement applies to the operation of applying heat for the purpose of curving handles for canes and umbrellas by means of a blast lamp fed with alcohol, as well as by means of a blast lamp fed with petroleum or mineral oil; and the defendant having admitted the fact that he applied heat for the purpose of curving handles for canes and umbrellas by means of a blast lamp fed with alcohol, he must be deemed to have infringed plaintiff's patent, and to have been guilty of a contempt in violating the terms of the injunction issued in the principal case, wherein plaintiff was declared owner of the patent in question, and defendant enjoined from its infringement.<br\/><br\/>The argument of counsel for defendant and appellant, based on the theory that the questions herein discussed and decided have been heretofore settled by this court, and that the subject-matter of this proceeding is <i>res adjudicata<\/i> between the parties thereto is sufficiently refuted by the simple reading of the decision of this court in the case relied upon.\u00a0 (Gsell <i>vs<\/i>.

This action was brought in the month of May, 1905.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the lower court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the sum of P5,117.55 and costs.\u00a0 From this judgment the defendant duly excepted and presented a motion for a new trial in the lower court, which was denied; to which ruling the defendant also excepted.<br\/><br\/>The defendant presents three assignments of error in this court.\u00a0 They are as follows;<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"1.\u00a0 The court below erred in considering that the plaintiff had legal capacity to bring the present action against the defendant.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 The court below erred in holding that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of P3,208.50 as capital.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 The court below erred in sentencing the defendant to pay the legal interest on the capital of P3,208.50 from January 1, 1897.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>While the defendant presented a motion for a new trial in the lower court, he has not brought the proof to this court.\u00a0 In our conclusions, therefore, we are governed by the facts stated in the decision of the lower court, for the reason that the defendant filed, among his other defenses, a general denial.<br\/><br\/>The lower court in its decision made the following findings :<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"In view of all the evidence offered in this case I find that, at the time of the death of Ledesma, the sum of P3,208.50 was due his estate.\u00a0 This balance has never been paid, and was due the estate together with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent from the 1st of January, 1897, making a grand total of P5,117.55 on December 1, 1900.<br\/><br\/>\"Inasmuch as the papers were lost by the plaintiff in the manner mentioned above, he was required to account for the property received by him as guardian of the heirs.\u00a0 Extensive litigation followed before the superior provost court under the military government of the United States in these Islands, which practically resulted in a settlement of the claim of the estate against the plaintiff herein, as shown by Exhibit 1 which is attached to the record.\u00a0 Under the conditions of said settlement the plaintiff agreed to pay to said estate the sum of P16,000 in order to extinguish his liability.\u00a0 Said agreement was made by the president of the family council who, in accordance with the Spanish regulations, had charge of the settlement.\u00a0 It was subsequently approved by the superior provost court, and since the inauguration of the civil government has been ratified in a suit in connection with said Exhibit 1 which resulted in a judgment in favor of the said estate for the amount stipulated in said agreement, together with interest thereon.<br\/><br\/>\"At the trial of the case the defendant alleged that the plaintiff had no legal capacity to bring this action, because the said president of the family council had no authority to enter into such an agreement, but I believe that the actions of the representatives of the estate have repeatedly ratified the said agreement, even though the president of the family council had no authority to make it, and that this defendant is so connected with the events that he is not entitled to question the legal capacity of this plaintiff to maintain an action against him.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>With reference to the first assignment of error to wit, that the court committed an error in deciding that the plaintiff was the proper person to bring the present action-it appears that the lower court held that the agreement above referred to, by which the plaintiff became the owner of the account upon which the present action was based, was agreed to and accepted not only by the heirs of Pablo Ledesma, but also by the family council.\u00a0 By this agreement the account was transferred to and became the property of the plaintiff herein, he having settled his responsibility to the heirs by paying an amount agreed upon.\u00a0 He being the owner, therefore, by reason of this agreement, he certainly was entitled to maintain an action to cover the said account.\u00a0 The lower court, therefore, committed no error in holding that the plaintiff was the proper party to maintain the present action.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the second assignment of error-to wit, that the lower court committed an error in deciding that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of P3,208.50-the lower court made an express finding upon this question in the first paragraph of the decision above quoted.\u00a0 The appellant not having brought the evidence to this court, we are bound by this finding of fact.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the third assignment of error-to wit, that the lower court committed an error in rendering a judgment against the defendant for the payment of interest upon the said amount of P3,208.50, from the 1st of January, 1897-we are of the opinion, and so hold, that there are no facts in the decision to justify this conclusion.\u00a0 Under the provisions of the Civil Code, the contract itself containing no provision for the payment of interest, no interest could be collected upon the same until after a judicial or extra-judicial demand had been made for the payment\u00a0 of the same.\u00a0 (Arts. 1755 and 1100, Civil Code; Manresa's Commentaries on the Civil Code, vol. 8, page 56; La Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos de Filipinas <i>vs.<\/i> Araza, 7 Phil. Rep., 455.)<br\/><br\/>In the present case it does not appear that the account bore interest; neither does it appear that there was any judicial or extrajudicial demand made for the payment of the same until the commencement of the present action, which was in the month of May, 1905.\u00a0 Therefore the plaintiff is not entitled to interest for any\u00a0 period prior to the demand made by the commencement of the present action.\u00a0 (Bautista <i>vs.<\/i> Calixto, 7 Phil. Rep., 733.)<br\/><br\/>The facts set out by the judge in his decision are not sufficient, therefore, to justify his conclusion that the plaintiff was entitled to interest upon the said amount of P3,208.50, from the 1st of January, 1897.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court is, therefore, hereby modified, and it is hereby directed that a judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the sum of P3,208.50, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, from the 31st day of May, 1905, and costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C J., Torres, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 13 Phil.

EMILIA GUY-SAYCO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">Long before the commission of the crime herein prosecuted, Gelasio Galupitan, the husband of the accused, entered into unlawful relations with the deceased Lorenza Estrada; all were residents of the town of Santa Cruz, the capital of the Province of La Laguna.<br\/><br\/>The accused, Emilia Guy-sayco, duly became aware of this relation.\u00a0 As her husband had stayed away from home for more than two weeks, remaining in the barrio of Dujat, distant about two and one-half hours' walk from the said town under the pretext that he was engaged in field work, on the 20th of March, 1907, at about 2 p. m., she decided to go to said barrio and join him.\u00a0 To this end she hired a <i>carromata<\/i>, and after getting some clothes and other things necessary for herself and husband, started out with her infant child and a servant girl; but before reaching the barrio and the <i>camarin<\/i> where her husband ought to be, night came on, and at about 7 o'clock she alighted and dismissed the vehicle after paying the driver.\u00a0 They had yet to travel some distance, and for fear of being attacked she disguised herself, using her husband's clothes and a hat given to her by her companion, and dressed in this manner they continued on their way. On seeing her husband's horse tied in front of a house she suspected that he was inside; thereupon she went to the steps leading to the house, which was a low one, and then saw her husband sitting down with his back toward the steps.\u00a0 She immediately entered the house and encountered her husband, the deceased, and the owners of the house taking supper together.\u00a0 Overcome and blinded by jealousy she rushed at Lorenza Estrada, attacked her with a penknife that she carried, and inflicted five wounds upon her in consequence of which Lorenza fell to the ground covered with blood and died a few moments afterwards.\u00a0 The accused left the house immediately after the aggression, and went to that of Modesto Ramos where she changed her clothes.<br\/><br\/>From art examination of the body made on\u00a0 the following day by Dr. Gertrudo Reyes, it appeared that five wounds had been inflicted by a cutting and pointed weapon, one of which was on the left side of the breast and penetrated the left ventricle of the heart; this wound was of necessity mortal, the others being more or less serious.<br\/><br\/>A complaint was thereupon filed by the provincial fiscal on May 31, 1907, and the corresponding proceedings were instituted.\u00a0 The\u00a0 court below entered judgment on June 29, 1908, sentencing the accused, Emilia Guy-Sayco, to the penalty of twelve years and one day of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i>, to suffer the accessory penalties, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000, and to pay the costs.\u00a0 From said judgment she has appealed.<br\/><br\/>The above-stated facts, which have been fully proven in this case,\u00a0 constitute the crime of homicide defined and punished by article 404 of the Penal Code, for the reason that in the violent death of Lorenza Estrada, occasioned by the infliction of several wounds, one of which was mortal, none of the circumstances were present that qualify the crime of assassination and call for a heavier penalty as imposed by the previous article 403 of the code.<br\/><br\/>The reality and certitude of the crime at bar\u00a0 can not be denied.\u00a0 It has been proven by the testimony of several witnesses, to wit, Roberto Villaran, Susana de Mesa, the owners of the house, and Maria Ramos, all of whom witnessed the aggression; they saw the deceased die as the result of five wounds inflicted upon her, one of which was, of necessity mortal; it was also proven by the testimony of the surgeon who examined the body, which was seen by the said witnesses and by others who went to the place of the occurrence.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 accused pleaded not guilty, and in exculpation she alleged that, when Lorenza Estrada saw her and heard her remonstrate with her husband, she being then upstairs, Lorenza at once asked what had brought her there and manifested her intention to attack her with a knife that she carried in her hand, whereupon the accused caught the deceased by the right hand, in which she held the weapon, and immediately grappled with her, and in the struggle that ensued she managed to\u00a0 get hold of a penknife that she saw on the floor close by; she could not say whether she struck the deceased with it as she could not account for what followed.<br\/><br\/>From this allegation of the accused, her counsel, with a view to asking that she be absolved, claims that in wounding the deceased she acted in proper self-defense.<br\/><br\/>It has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that as soon as the accused entered the house where she found her husband, without saying a word, she attacked the deceased with a penknife and inflicted wounds that caused the immediate death of the latter.\u00a0 Such an allegation can not therefore be admitted, even though corroborated by the husband and the servant of the accused, inasmuch as the testimony of the latter is entirely contradicted and destroyed by the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, who were present at the aggression, and who deny that the servant was present; it is not true that a penknife was found on the floor of the house; it is probable that the instrument with which the crime was committed was carried by the accused when she went to said house; and even though it were true that when the accused, Emilia, made her appearance, the deceased Lorenza arose with a knife in her hand and in a threatening manner asked the accused what had brought her there, such attitude, under the provisions of article 8, No. 4 of the Penal Code, does not\u00a0 constitute that unlawful aggression, which, among others, is the first indispensable requisite upon which exemption by reason of self-defense may be sustained.<br\/><br\/>In order to consider that an unlawful aggression was actually committed, it is necessary that an attack or material aggression, an offensive act positively determining the intent of the aggressor to cause an injury shall have been made; a mere threatening or intimidating attitude is not sufficient to justify the commission of an act which is punishable <i>per se<\/i>, and allow a claim of exemption from liability on the ground that' it was committed in self-defense.\u00a0 It has always\u00a0 been so recognized in the decisions of the courts, in accordance with the provisions of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime the presence of mitigating circumstance No. 7 of article 9 of the code should be considered, without any aggravating circumstance to neutralize its effects, for the reason that it has been proven that the accused, at the time when the crime was committed, acted upon the impulse of passion and under great jealous excitement at the sight of her husband taking supper in the company of his mistress, after he had been absent from the conjugal dwelling for several days.<br\/><br\/>As to the penalty of indemnity contained in the judgment appealed from and impugned by the defense, article 17 of the code reads: \"Every person criminally liable for a crime or misdemeanor is also civilly liable,\" and according to the established rule of the courts, in\u00a0 order that\u00a0 an accused person may be declared to have incurred civil liability, it is sufficient that said liability shall proceed from, or be the consequence of the criminal liability, and in addition thereto, article 122 of said code provides that the courts shall regulate the amount of indemnity for damages under said civil liability, upon the same terms as prescribed for the reparation of damage in article 121 of the code, and a finding on the matter should be contained in the judgment.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above set forth it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, as we do hereby affirm it in all its parts with costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The evidence of Zacarias Esmero, one of the above-named witnesses, who testifies that the plaintiff, the defendant, and Pacita Ballori appeared before the justice at the time named and did sign\u00a0 the document referred to.\u00a0 Fourth.\u00a0 The evidence of Pacita Ballori, who testified to the same effect.\u00a0 Fifth.\u00a0 The evidence of Jose Santiago, the bailiff of the court of the justice of the peace, who testified that the plaintiff, the defendant, the two witnesses above-named, and the justice of the peace were all present in the office of the justice of the peace at the time mentioned.<br\/><br\/>The only direct evidence in favor of the plaintiff is her own testimony that she never appeared before the justice of the peace and never was married to the defendant.\u00a0 She admits that she signed the document in question, but says that she signed it in her own home, without reading it, and at the request of the defendant, who told her that it was a paper authorizing him to ask the consent of her parents to the marriage.<br\/><br\/>There is some indirect evidence which the plaintiff claims supports her case, but which we think, when properly considered, is not entitled to much weight.\u00a0 The plaintiff at the time was visiting, in the town of Palompon, her married brother and was there for about two weeks.\u00a0 The wife of her brother, Rosario Bayot, testified that the plaintiff never left the house except in her company.\u00a0 But she admitted on cross-examination that she herself\u00a0 went to school every morning and that on one occasion the plaintiff had gone to church unaccompanied.\u00a0 The testimony of this witness loses its force when the testimony of Pacita Ballori is considered.\u00a0 She says that at the request of the defendant on the day named, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, she went to the store of a Chinese named Veles; that there she met the plaintiff and her mother; that she asked the mother of the plaintiff to allow the plaintiff to accompany her, the witness, to her own house for the purpose of examining some dress patterns; that the mother gave her consent and the two girls left the store, but instead of going to the house of the witness they went directly to the office of the justice of the peace where the ceremony took place; that after the ceremony had taken place, one came advising them that the mother was approaching, and that they thereupon hurriedly left the office of the justice and went to the house of Pacita Ballori, where the mother later found them.<br\/><br\/>The other testimony of the plaintiff relating to certain statements made by the justice of the peace, who died after the ceremony was performed and before the trial, and certain statements made by Pacita Ballori, is not sufficient to overcome the positive testimony of the witnesses for the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of Pacita\u00a0 Ballori is severely criticised by counsel\u00a0 for the appellant in his brief.\u00a0 It appears that during her first examination she was seized with an hysterical attack and practically collapsed at the trial.\u00a0 Her examination was adjourned\u00a0 to a future day and was completed in her house where she was sick in bed.\u00a0 It is claimed by counsel that her collapse was due to the fact that she recognized that she testified falsely in stating that the office of the justice of the peace was at the time in the municipal building, when, in fact, it was in a private house.\u00a0 We do not think that the record justifies the claim of the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 The statement as to the location of the office of the justice of the peace was afterwards corrected by the witness and we are satisfied that she told the facts substantially as they occurred.<br\/><br\/>There is, moreover, in the case written evidence which satisfies us that the plaintiff was not telling the truth when she said she did not appear before the justice of the peace.\u00a0 This evidence consists of eight letters, which the defendant claims were all written by the plaintiff.\u00a0 The plaintiff admits that she wrote letters numbered 2 and 9.\u00a0 The authenticity of the others was proven.\u00a0 No. 9 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"ANGEL:\u00a0 Up to this time I did not see my father;

MARIANO MEDINA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On May 24, 1907, Tomas Olino filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance of Capiz against Mariano Medina, in which he alleged that, in consideration of the sum of P175, which the plaintiff owed the defendant from about February, 1905, he mortgaged a parcel of rice land owned by him and his sister Albina Olino.\u00a0 The land is situated in the barrio of Sibaguan, pueblo of Capiz, the capital town of the province, and has a seeding capacity of about three and one-half <i>cavanes<\/i>, and its boundaries are given in the complaint.\u00a0 Among other conditions it was stipulated that, after the harvesting of two crops of <i>palay<\/i>, to be reckoned from the year in which the contract was made, the possession of the land should be restored to the plaintiff; that in the said month of February, after the execution of a private document, delivery was made of the land to the defendant; that the time for the redemption of said land was fixed for the period subsequent to the month of November, 1906, but the defendant has unjustly refused and now refuses to permit the said redemption in spite of the demands privately made on various occasions by the plaintiff, and of the delivery or payment of the redemption price, and by reason of such unjust refusal to accede to the redemption the defendant has caused the plaintiff damages to the amount of P600; wherefore said plaintiff prayed for judgment against the defendant for the return of the possession of the mortgaged land, the payment of P500 as damages caused, and the costs of this action, the plaintiff undertaking to pay the defendant the sum of P175 due him.<br\/><br\/>In his answer to the complaint the defendant entered a denial to each and every one of the essential allegations thereof, and prayed the court that he be absolved from the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The case being heard, the evidence of both sides having been submitted, and the documents presented by the defendant together with the translations thereof having been made part of the record, the court rendered judgment on July 9, 1908, absolving the defendant from the complaint and sentencing the plaintiff to the payment of the costs.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff excepted to said judgment and moved for the reopening of the trial on the grounds that the findings of fact therein\u00a0 were manifestly against the weight of the evidence and that the judgment was contrary to law.\u00a0 His motion was denied, the petitioner excepted to the ruling of the court, and the\u00a0 corresponding bill of exceptions was certified and forwarded to the office of the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff claims the restitution of a piece of land which he delivered to the defendant as security for the sum of P175 which he had received from the latter, on the ground that the period within which he could recover the land had already expired, the plaintiff, moreover, obliging himself to pay him said sum.<br\/><br\/>The defendant denied the allegations of the plaintiff and testified that he acquired the land, with the knowledge and consent of the owner thereof, the plaintiff herein, by absolute\u00a0 purchase from Isidora or Teodora Rendon for the sum of P175.<br\/><br\/>It appears fully proven in the records that the plaintiff Tomas Olino, at the request of Isidora Rendon, made an effort to procure money wherewith to redeem the land which he had sold to the latter\u00a0 on\u00a0 August 4, 1902, with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>.\u00a0 He found Mariano Medina ready to furnish the money to redeem the land, according to Olino, or according to Medina, to purchase it outright.\u00a0 Certain it is that they came to an agreement and went to see Isidora Rendon, the original purchaser, who, by her own statement, received from Tomas Olino the said amount for the redemption of the land, in the presence of Mariano Medina who had furnished it and had drafted the document in the local dialect.\u00a0 This document was signed by Rendon, and its translation into Spanish (English), is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"I indorse\u00a0 these documents to Mariano Medina, for the same amount of one hundred <i>cavanes<\/i> of good quality, clean, white <i>palay<\/i>, which he himself shall deliver to me within two weeks from this date, binding himself to the payment of damages in case of delay.\u00a0 I hereby acknowledge receipt from Mariano Medina of the sum of 150 pesos, Philippine currency, which he deposited with me or left in my possession as security for the purchase from me of the land of Tomas Olino.\u00a0 Capiz, January 22, 1905.-(Sgd.)\u00a0 Teodora Rendon.-Translated from Visayan into Spanish (English).\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The contending parties, including the witness Isidora Rendon, all agree that these transactions were had between them; they only disagree in that Olino avers that he had borrowed from Medina the sum of P175 to redeem his land from Isidora Rendon, who had bought it years previously under <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, and that he afterwards delivered the land to his creditor as security for his\u00a0 debt.\u00a0 On the other hand, Medina contends that he had acquired the land in question by absolute purchase from Isidora Rendon, who had bought it from its Original owner, Tomas Olino, and, conditioned on the execution by Rendon of the proper instrument therefor, she indorsed the document relating to said land, moreover he denies that he had entered into the contract alleged by Olino, although the latter had received from him a gratuity of P20.<br\/><br\/>From the facts alleged and proven\u00a0 at the trial of this cause it is gathered that there was entered, into between Medina and Olino either a contract of sale of said land with the right of repurchase, or one of loan of PI75 secured by the land in question.<br\/><br\/>Inasmuch as we are in doubt as to which of the two contracts it was by reason of which Medina furnished the P175 with which Olino redeemed his land from Isidora Rendon, and Olino in turn consented to the transfer of the land to Medina, the party who furnished the money, we elect to consider that said contract was that of loan, because such a contract involves a smaller transmission of rights and interests, and the debtor does not surrender all rights to his property but simply confers upon the creditor the right to collect what is owing from the value of the thing given as security, there existing between the parties a greater reciprocity of rights and\u00a0 obligations.\u00a0 (Art. 1289, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The trial judge himself, in paragraph 9 of his judgment, printed at page 5 of the bill of exceptions, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"We admit that the fact that both the plaintiff and the defendant went to the house of Teodora or Isidora Rendon to pay her the sum of P175, can be construed in the sense that Olino did not wish to dispose of his land, but that he borrowed money from Medina in order to redeem the property he had sold to Teodora Rendon, and that he simply turned the land over to Medina as security for the obligation he had contracted in favor of the latter.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>On the theory that Olino had borrowed P175 from Medina in order to redeem his land from Isidora Rendon, and in the absence of conclusive evidence to prove that Olino had in his turn sold the land to Medina, the latter, after the payment by Olino of the sum due him, is not entitled permanently to retain the land nor to redeem the same.<br\/><br\/>If the statement of Medina were true, to the effect that he had purchased the land from Isidora Rendon outright, inasmuch as the latter was not the exclusive owner thereof, and upon its redemption she was no longer even a temporary owner and could not have transmitted to Medina, the purchaser, any right whatever, it is seen that the defendant Medina, not being the lawful owner of the property, is not entitled to hold it nor to retain possession thereof permanently, provided that Olino pay the sum of P175 due him.<br\/><br\/>The word \"indorse\" (<i>endoso<\/i>), used in document No. 1, that was signed by Isidora or Teodora Rendon signifies nothing more than the transfer of the documents relating to said land, to-wit, the property in controversy herein; the word, however, does not mean that the land was absolutely sold to Medina.<br\/><br\/>In his sworn declaration Medina set forth that he acquired the land from Rendon, and for that purpose the latter signed the indorsement and obligated herself to execute an instrument of sale.\u00a0 This she was not able to do, because it was essential that the same should bear the signature of Tomas Olino which did not appear, although the defendant himself stated that Olino's wife went to him and endeavored to redeem the land from him, but he told her that the transaction should be made by Olino himself.\u00a0 By these and other contradictory statements of Mariano Medina,\u00a0 it becomes apparent that he recognized that Tomas Olino still had some rights over the land.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, on the supposition that the contract between the parties\u00a0 was not one of sale but one of loan, in spite of the denial of the defendant, and seeing that the instrument alleged by the plaintiff does not exist, for if Tomas Olino did not sell to Mariano Medina the land held by the latter, and nothing to the contrary appears on the records, and Medina himself states that he bought it, not from Olino, but from Isidora Rendon, it follows from the facts of record that the sum of P175 was given by Medina\u00a0 to Olino in the nature of a loan secured by the possession of the\u00a0 land in question by the creditor, and therefore, the latter is entitled to\u00a0 collect his credit and at-the same time is under the obligation to return the land to its owner upon receipt of the above-mentioned sum.\u00a0 (Arts. 1157, 1158,\u00a0 1162, 1754, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>In view of the above considerations we are of the opinion that the\u00a0 judgment appealed from should be reversed, and, holding that the contract entered into by the parties was one of loan, we hereby sentence Mariano Medina, upon payment to him by Tomas Olino of the sum of P175 due, to return to said Tomas Olino the land belonging to him and at present held by Medina, without special ruling as to costs; and, inasmuch as there is no evidence that the defendant has held possession of the land in bad faith, no provision is made herein for the payment of damages.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><center><b>DISSENTING<\/b><\/center><br\/><b>WILLARD, J.,<\/b> <br\/><br\/>Prior to the 22d of January, 1905, the day when Isidora Rendon received the P175, she was the owner of the land subject only to the right of Olino to repurchase it.\u00a0 This right did not expire till the 4th of August, 1906.\u00a0 The nature of the transaction of the 22d of January,\u00a0 1905, should be decided relying on the document then executed rather than upon the oral evidence of the plaintiff.\u00a0 That document shows that there was no repurchase nor redemption by Olino.\u00a0 The rights acquired by Rendon by the contract of 1902 were not then extinguished.\u00a0 They were transferred to Medina.\u00a0 The use of the word <i>endoso<\/i> proves this.<br\/><br\/>If there were a redemption by Olino and a new contract between him and Medina, there would be no reason why, the debt having been extinguished, the papers evidencing it should not have been delivered to Olino.\u00a0 The fact that they are now found in the possession of Medina shows that he is entitled to the rights created by them.\u00a0 The testimony of Medina and Rendon supports this theory.<br\/><br\/>Olino testified that, after the transaction\u00a0 with Rendon he made a written contract\u00a0 with Medina by which he had the right to redeem the land at any time after two years.\u00a0 The evidence clearly supports the finding of the court below that no such written contract was made, and this court is of the same opinion.\u00a0 Exactly\u00a0 what the new contract between Olino and Medina was, the court does not state, except to say that it was a loan with the land as security.\u00a0 The time for the payment of the loan is not stated.<br\/><br\/>Why Medina should have been willing to give up the written contract purchased from Rendon, under which he would become the owner of the land in a year and a half if Olino did not repurchase, and accept in place thereof a verbal agreement by which he loaned Olino P176, for an indefinite term without any security at all, does not appear.\u00a0 I say without any security, for no authorities are cited by the court to show that real estate may be the subject of a pledge, or that a mortgage may be created thereon by mere delivery of the possession.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the case that Rendon desired to receive her money, saying that the land produced nothing.\u00a0 Olino was not able to pay her, but he was able to find a person, Medina, who would buy her interest.\u00a0 The result of the transaction was that Medina took the place of Rendon and that Olino still had more than a year and a half in which to buy from Medina,<br\/><br\/>It may be that, on the 22d of January, 1905, Medina bought Rendon's interest in the land and at the same time paid Olino P25 for a surrender by him of his rights to repurchase, thus becoming the absolute owner.\u00a0 This would explain his testimony as to the execution of a deed in which both Olino and Rendon should join.\u00a0 But, however this may be, he bought at all events the rights of Rendon, and Olino, not having repurchased the property before August, 1906, was after that date the owner.\u00a0 I think that the judgment should be affirmed.<br\/><\/div>",

the said properties, assessed at the last assessment, at P44,112, were acquired by inheritance from their late parents, Claudio Sandoval and Evarista Manlave, who died intestate in Palawan on December 31, 1896, and January 17, 1906, respectively; that no encumbrance of any kind exists upon the said\u00a0 properties, nor has any person any rights of participation therein, although in that parcel marked with the letter H, Lucio Villareal, Marcelino Bayos, Juan Endencia, Agustin Rodriguez, and Domingo Cacula, together with other individuals at the instigation of Serafin Rodriguez have, since the latter part of December, 1905, claimed possession of said land; the names of the lessees on shares who occupy the said lands, and the names of the owners of the adjoining estates, all residents of the town of Coron, Province of Paragua, now Palawan, are given as well as the residence and status of the applicants; and that the described lands, in the possession of and owned for more than fifty years by Evarista Manlave, were inherited by her from her late parents, Nicolas Manlave and Silvestra Bartolome, who died on May 8 and September 8, 1888, respectively, but that parcel marked Q was purchased by Claudio Sandoval from its original owner, Loreto Zapla; all said parcels are used for the cultivation of rice and cocoanuts, and, with the exception of the one marked H, which is used as a pasture for cows and carabaos, are fenced in\u00a0 with bamboo; the applicants therefore claim the benefit of Chapter VI [sec. 54], paragraph 6, of the Public Land Act, and submit the respective plans of said estates and a descriptive report on the same together with a certificate from the president of the town of Culion, Calamianes,<br\/><br\/>The examiner of titles rendered an opinion opposed to the claim of the applicants who, however, insisted therein.\u00a0 Thereafter, on October 5, 1906, the Attorney-General appeared on behalf of the Director of Lands, setting forth that the lands referred to in the\u00a0 application presented by Vicente Sandoval and others are public property, and that the applicants had not been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of the said 17 parcels during the ten years immediately preceding the\u00a0 enforcement of Act No. 926, and for said\u00a0 reason he objected to the registration applied for, and prayed the court to deny the same with costs.<br\/><br\/>At the trial of the case, evidence was adduced by both parties, and on April 16, 1907, the court below rendered judgment dismissing the opposition on the part of the Attorney-General representing the Insular Government and the Director of Lands, owing to his statement that he did not desire to insist in his opposition to said application with respect to the parcels of land, the plans of which were marked A, C, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, and Q, but that from the parcel G, the triangle formed by the lines B, C, D and D, B, should, however, be excluded, and for the reasons he gave, he stated that the applicants were entitled to obtain a certificate of title to said\u00a0 parcels of land in accordance with paragraph 6 of section 54 of said Act No. 926.<br\/><br\/>For reasons given it was also held that the representative of the applicants was entitled to a certificate of title in accordance with the paragraph, section, and\u00a0 Act cited above, to the parcels of land\u00a0 referred to in the plans marked B and E, and to the greater portion of the land to which plan marked F refers, with the exception of that portion situated between the Muchong River and the sea and Mount Sinibtayan; therefore, the opposition of the Government with respect to said portion of land in the plan marked F, bounded on the south and west by the sea, and on the north and east by the slopes of Mount Sinibtayan and the Muchong River was sustained, and the opposition with respect to the remainder of parcel F and the parcels B and E dismissed.<br\/><br\/>The opposition of the Government relative to the whole of the parcel shown in the plan Exhibit H was sustained for reasons given, and therefore, after a declaration of default against all parties concerned with the exception of the Government, the court decreed the adjudication and registration of the parcels whose plans are marked A, B, C, D, E, I, J, K, L, M, N O, P, and Q, and the described portions of the parcels F and G in favor of counsel for the applicants; the application relative to the whole of parcel H, the triangle mentioned of parcel G, and also the indicated portion of parcel F which is bounded on the south and west by the sea and on the north and east by the plains at the foot of Mount Sinibtayan and the Muchong River was dismissed.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the applicants excepted to the above decision so far as it dismissed the application with\u00a0 respect to the parcel of land marked H and the indicated portion of parcel F, and moved for\u00a0 a new trial on the ground that the evidence did not justify the judgment in connection with the parts excepted to, and because said judgment was contrary to law; the motion was overruled, to which the petitioner excepted and presented the corresponding bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>On May 22,1907, the Attorney-General in turn presented a written exception to the said judgment as to the decree granting the adjudication and registration of the parcels of land marked A, B, C,\u00a0 D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, and Q, and in addition moved for a new\u00a0 trial; the motion was overruled.<br\/><br\/>By another writing of the 23d of July following, the representative of the Government excepted to the overruling of his\u00a0 former motion limiting it to the parcels of land marked with the letters B, E, and F.\u00a0 Bills of exceptions were submitted by both the applicants and the Attorney-General, that of the applicants relating to parcel H and that portion of parcel F, the\u00a0 registration of which were denied; the Attorney-General's bill of exceptions referred to the three parcels mentioned above.<br\/><br\/>In view of the fact that counsel for the Government waived his opposition made in the beginning against the application for the registration of the parcels of land marked with the letters A, O, D,\u00a0 I, J; K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, and G, with the exception of that portion of the latter which is a triangle formed by the lines BC, CD, DB, and in view of the fact that the evidence proves that the applicants, by themselves and by their antecessors, have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of the mentioned parcels of agricultural land for more than the last twenty years as the owners thereof, the judge of the Court of Land\u00a0 Registration held that the interested parties were entitled to a certificate of title in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 6, section 54, of Act No. 926, and to that effect decreed the registration of said parcels of land, and dismissed the opposition with respect thereto.<br\/><br\/>These parts of the judgment have not been impugned, nor are they now the subject of appeal; therefore, this decision will not deal therewith.<br\/><br\/>As to the parcels of land indicated by the letters B, E, and F, less that portion of the latter which is bounded on the south and west by the sea and on the north and east by the slopes of Mount Sinibtayan and the Muchong River, the record discloses sufficient proof that the ancestors of the applicants, and after their death the applicants themselves, have been in possession of and materially occupied the said land for more than thirty years without any interruption whatever, cultivating certain parts thereof, and using others for the pasture of animals, keeping them fenced in for the purpose of preserving at the same time the trees, shrubs, and bamboo growing thereon in order to meet various needs in the field.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 6 of section 54 of Act No, 926 reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"All persons who by themselves or their predecessors in interest have been in the open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of agricultural public lands, as defined by said Act of Congress of July first, nineteen hundred and two, under a bona fide claim of ownership except as against the Government, for a period of ten years next preceding the taking effect of this Act, except when prevented by war or <i>force majeure<\/i>, shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a Government grant and to have received the same, and shall be entitled to a certificate of title to such land under the provisions of this chapter.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>As may be seen from the foregoing paragraph, the Act requires not that the land be cultivated, but an open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of the same with good faith and under claim of ownership for more than ten years prior to the year 1904, in which the said Act took effect, and since it appears of record that the applicants, together with their predecessors have been in possession of the three parcels of land above alluded to, in good faith and under title of ownership, and have performed the requirements established by the law, no legal reason exists for revoking that part of the judgment appealed from referring to the three mentioned parcels of land, with the exception of the small portion situated between the sea and the Muchong River, and which only comprises Mount Sinibtayan; the plain of that name bordering the sitio of Balatbat, which, according to the plan marked F, constitutes the remainder of this parcel acknowledged in favor of the applicants is not included in this exception.<br\/><br\/>As regards the parcel of land marked in the plan with the letter H, the court has held that the evidence adduced in the case does not prove the open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of the property with good faith which is necessary in order to acquire ownership and right to a certificate of title in accordance with paragraph 6 of the aforesaid Act.<br\/><br\/>Such a holding accords with the result and the merits of the case,\u00a0 inasmuch as, considering as a whole the testimony of the witnesses offered by the representative of the applicants, it is not possible to infer therefrom that the open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of the land comprised in the parcel of 1,501 hectares, marked H, was enjoyed with good faith for more than ten years prior to 1904, with the intention of acquiring the ownership thereof, since, aside from the inconsistencies observed in the testimony of the said witnesses, Vicente Sandoval, one of the applicants, notwithstanding his allegation that he, together with his predecessors and his coowners, had been in possession of such a large tract of land for more than thirty years, avers that he only knew of the land in 1902, in which year it was surveyed and posts were placed to indicate the boundary lines; it does not appear that fences were placed around the entire property; they were only built in certain places in order to prevent the cattle from straying; said fences were often removed to other places as the animals moved on.<br\/><br\/>Opposed to the statement of the witnesses of the applicants there is the testimony of the witnesses of the Government, who unanimously aver that the land marked in the plan with the letter H was in its entirety a <i>cogonal<\/i>, suitable for pasture; that animals belonging to different owners grazed over it, among which were those of the Sandoval y Manlave family; that with the exception of a small parcel of about 30 hectares, occupied and plowed by one of them, Hilario Alberto, no one else was known to have ever owned or been entitled to said land, nor had anyone seen the whole of it fenced in; this point is confirmed by the provincial governor, Edward Y. Miller.<br\/><br\/>It may be true that the forefathers of the applicants, and the latter themselves by means of their servants, allowed their cattle to graze over said land, and in places built fences to prevent the\u00a0 scattering and loss of the animals, but it is none the less true that animals owned by others also used to graze over the said property; the fact that the cattle of the applicants and of their antecessors grazed over the land in question is no conclusive evidence of their dominion, since it has not been proven that they exercised acts of ownership, were in open, continuous, and peaceful possession of the whole of the land, and had caused it to be inclosed to the exclusion of other persons; it does appear as proven in the case that the applicants and their antecessors possessed the said land as owners for the time fixed by the law; and though for the effects of possession as owner the law does not require that the land shall be cultivated, yet it does unquestionably require that whoever claims such possession shall exercise acts of dominion and ownership which can not be mistaken for the momentary and accidental enjoyment of the property.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing considerations, and those stated by the court below, the judgment appealed from must be and is affirmed without costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

CROSSFIELD, JUDGE  OF THE COURT  OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, AND VICENTE GUASH, ADMINISTRATOR OF THE  ESTATE OF JOSE JIMENEZ Y MIJARES, DEFENDANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">From the record it appears that on the 2d day of November, 1906, the said Vicente Guash, as administrator of the estate of Jose Jimenez y Mijares, commenced an action in the Court of First Instance against the said Juana Espiritu, for the purpose of recovering the possession of certain personal property described in the second paragraph of said complaint.<br\/><br\/>The defendant answered the petition of the plaintiff in that action, alleging that she had purchased said personal property of the said Jose Jimenez y Mijares on the 19th of January, 1906.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the judge found that the plaintiff, as administrator of the estate of Jose Jimenez y Mijares, was entitled to the possession of said personal property, or the value thereof, in case delivery could not be had, which value was fixed at the sum of P1,000.<br\/><br\/>From that judgment the defendant (Juana Espiritu) appealed to the Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>After a consideration of the record  brought to the Supreme Court, the judgment of the lower court was reversed and the defendant (Juana Espiritu) was absolved, without costs.  (Guash <i>vs.<\/i> Espiritu, 11 Phil. Rep., 184.)<br\/><br\/>The decision of the Supreme Court was based upon the provisions of section 712 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, for the reason that the judge below had not found as a fact either that the plaintiff had no other remedy or that there was a deficiency of assets, and for the reason that there was no such allegation in the pleadings in the court below.  The effect of the decision of the Supreme Court in that cause was to dismiss the cause of action and to relieve the defendant (Espiritu) from any liability in that action.  Final judgment to that effect was rendered on the 24th of September, 1908, in the Supreme Court and the cause was duly remanded to the lower court on the 5th of October, 1908, with direction to enter a judgment to the same effect.  The cause was received in the lower court on the said 5th of October, 1908.<br\/><br\/>It must be remembered that the original action (Guash <i>vs.<\/i> Espiritu) was for the purpose of recovering the personal property described in the complaint, or its value, and that at the beginning of the action in the lower court' the property was taken from the possession of the defendant (Espiritu) and delivered to the plaintiff, and it is to be supposed that the  property was in the possession of the plaintiff at the time of the final judgment rendered in said cause, as well as at the time said amended pleading was filed in said cause.<br\/><br\/>It is to be supposed that a judgment was entered in the lower court in accordance with the direction of the Supreme Court.  However, notwithstanding the judgment of this court dismissing said cause of action and absolving the defendant from liability, the plaintiff (Guash) obtained permission of the lower court and filed an amended complaint in said cause, thereby attempting to keep alive said cause of action.<br\/><br\/>On the 22d of July, 1909, the defendant in that action (Juana Espiritu) commenced an original action in this court against A. S. Crossfield, one of the judges of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, and Vicente Guash, administrator, etc., reciting substantially the substance of the facts hereinbefore set out and prayed for the following relief;<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"In view of all the foregoing the plaintiff petitions the Supreme Court-<br\/><br\/>\" (1) To issue a writ of mandamus against the Hon. A. S. Crossfield, judge of First Instance, Manila, directing him to issue an order of execution in connection with the afore-said judgment of the Supreme Court, requiring Vicente Guash, administrator of the antestate estate of Jose Jimenez y Mijares to return to Juana Espiritu the personal property taken by the said administrator.<br\/><br\/>\"(2) To issue a preliminary writ of prohibition against the said judge of First Instance, ordering him to desist and abstain from further proceedings under the amended and supplementary complaint presented in the civil suit No. 5000 by Vicente Guash, administrator of the intestate estate of Jose Jimenez y Mijares, against Juana Espiritu.<br\/><br\/>\"(3) To condemn the defendant herein to the payment of the costs of this action.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The theory of the plaintiff (Espiritu) in this action is \u2014<br\/><br\/><blockquote>(1) That the original action having been dismissed and she having been relieved from all responsibility in such action, that she was entitled to a return of the personal property, of the possession of which she had been deprived.<br\/><br\/>(2) That a final judgment having been rendered in such original action, the same could not be revived by the filing of an amended complaint in said cause.<br\/><br\/>(3) That the lower court should be directed to issue an execution directing Guash (the plaintiff) to return to her (Espiritu) the possession of the personal property in question.<\/blockquote><br\/>This contention of the plaintiff in the present action presents, in fact, but one question, to wit, the right of any of the, parties to an action to amend their pleadings after final judgment has been rendered in the cause.  Upon this question of the right to amend pleadings, the modern codes of procedure in civil actions, as well as criminal, are very liberal.  Section 110 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, in force in the Philippine Islands, provides that \u2014<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The court shall, in furtherance of justice, and on such terms, if any, as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding and <i>at any stage of the action<\/i>, in eitheir the Court of First Instance or the Supreme Court, by adding or striking out the name of any party, either plaintiff or defendant, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake or inadequate allegation or description in any other respect, so that the actual merits of the controversy may speedily be determined, without regard to technicalities and in the most expeditious and inexpensive manner.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>It will be noted that the right to amend covers almost all possible amendments which  might be made, but that it limits the rime of the amendment, by saying that it shall be made <i>\"at any stage of the action.\"<\/i>  We are of the opinion and so hold that after (final judgment has been rendered that the action is closed and the time for amendments is passed.<br\/><br\/>This court said in the case of Molina <i>vs.<\/i> De la Riva (8 Phil. Rep., 569) :<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"After judgment is rendered [in the Supreme Court] and the case is returned to the lower court for execution, the party liable under the judgment will not be permitted, in opposition to the execution, to present for consideration new issues of fact and law upon the question of his liability.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>If the parties, after final judgment, should be allowed to amend their pleadings at that time or take an exception to the issuance of an execution upon the final judgment rendered, the cause might never end; there might never'be a final termination of the litigation, for as often as an order for an execution was issued, if such practice should be permitted, the parties might present an exception and bring the case again to the higher court on appeal, and thus the cause be prolonged indefinitely.  Parties litigant, both plaintiff and defendant, should be required to state in the beginning of the action all of the facts upon which they rely-for their relief or for their defense, and their amendments should be allowed with great caution, to the end that parties litigant might not use this as a method of procrastination for an immeritorious cause, solely for the purpose of harassing their opponents.<br\/><br\/>Of course the Supreme Court in deciding the original action might have reserved to the defeated party (see Sanidad <i>vs.<\/i> Cabotaje, 5 Phil. Rep., 204) the right to amend their pleadings, and thus not have rendered a final judgment.  This the Supreme Court did  not do.  It rendered a final judgment closing that litigation, evidently believing that the parties had stated all of the1 facts upon which they relied for relief and for their defense, and, therefore, there existed no further facts upon which the pleadings could be amended, upon which the parties might rely for relief.<br\/><br\/>From all of the foregoing facts, we are of the opinion and so hold that the prayer oft the petition presented by the plaintiff in this  action should be and is hereby granted, with costs.  So ordered.<br\/><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa<\/i>, and<i> Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

that when they were married neither of them brought any property to the marriage, and that therefore, all the property found after her death should be considered as property acquired during marriage, with the exception of two parcels of rice land, the first of which, of a capacity of 3 <i>cavanes<\/i> of seed, situated in the rear of the church of said pueblo, she inherited from her mother, Petrona Espino, and the other parcel, of 21 <i>gantas<\/i> of seed, situated in the barrio of Lacuit in the same pueblo, she had inherited from her deceased sister Petrona Cabigting; that as she had full liberty to dispose of her own property, having no lawful or natural ascendants or descendants, she named her said husband, Florentino Cordero, as her sole and lawful heir to all such property as she owned at the time of her death; that in addition she appointed him her sole executor, conferring upon him all powers necessary under the law; that this was the first and only testament ever executed by her, and the intervention of the courts was prohibited unless absolutely necessary; and that owing to the fact that, by reason of her weakness she was unable to sign the will, the same was signed at her request by Teodoro Jurado, who, at the hour of 5.40 p. m. on the 12th day of January, 1908, in the town of Arayat, Province of Pampanga, interpreted the will to her in the Pampanga dialect.<br\/><br\/>At the foot of the will the following appears; \"At the request of Do\u00f1a Felicitas Cabigting.\u00a0 (Signed) Teodoro Jurado.\"<br\/><br\/>Following the will made by the testatrix Felicitas Cabigting it is shown that'it was signed at her request by Teodoro Jurado, and published by him in the name of said testatrix, who declared that it was her will and testament in the presence of three witnesses who, at her request and in her presence, and in the presence of each other, signed their respective names as witnesses of said will:\u00a0 \"(Signed) Teodoro Jurado; (Signed) Esteban Domingo;\u00a0 (Signed) Jacobo Fajardo.\"<br\/><br\/>The court set the 1st of April, 1908, for the probate of the will.\u00a0 Counsel for Pedro Cabigting opposed the said probate on the ground that the testatrix was not in the full enjoyment of her mental faculties, and because the will had not been drawn and signed in the manner provided by law.<br\/><br\/>Evidence was adduced by both parties, their witnesses were examined, and the document presented by the petitioner was made of record.\u00a0 After hearing the proofs adduced, the trial court rendered judgment on the 11th of April of the same year, admitting to probate said testament as the last will of Felicitas Cabigting, deceased, and appointing Florentino Cordero executor under a bond of P1,000 to be secured by two responsible bondsmen; commissioners of appraisement were also appointed to hear all claims that might be presented against the said estate in the manner prescribed by law.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing decision counsel for the opposition moved in writing on the said 11th of April for a new trial and the annulment of the above decision on the ground that Pedro Cabigting had been unable to produce evidence of his parentage with the deceased, and of his interest in the matter; that proofs referring to a description of the property of the deceased which would undoubtedly have influenced the decision of the court had lately been discovered and\u00a0 which, notwithstanding the diligence employed, could not be offered at the trial; that the decision rendered, together with the facts said to have been proven, are manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence, and that in addition said decision is contrary to law.<br\/><br\/>The petitioner, Florentino Cordero, opposed the foregoing motion and\u00a0 asked that the motion for a new trial be denied for the reason that a new trial as moved for can only be granted in an ordinary action, and not in special proceedings such as the probate of\u00a0 a will; that the oversight alleged by the opponent is not one of the reasons provided for by section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure; that the evidence said to have been newly discovered is not supported by affidavits as required by law; and because the facts which the judgment holds to have been proven sufficiently justify the court's decision, and the latter is fully in accordance with the provisions and doctrines of law applicable to the case.\u00a0 Said motion was overruled on the 15th of April, 1908.\u00a0 On the same date the opposition excepted to the decision admitting the supposed will to probate, in accordance with section 781 of Act No. 190, and appealed therefrom, offering to furnish the bond fixed at P350; this was done on the same date and a certified copy of the\u00a0 proceedings submitted to this court.<br\/><br\/>The alleged errors in the judgment appealed from consist in that the testatrix, Felicitas Cabigting, was not in full possession of her mental faculties, nor legally qualified to execute a will, and that the same had not been executed in accordance with the law; therefore, the court should not have ordered it probated.<br\/><br\/>All persons who are not expressly prohibited by law may make a will.\u00a0 (Art. 662, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>According to article 663 thereof the following are disqualified from making wills:\u00a0 (1) Persons of either sex under 14 years of age; (2) persons who permanently or temporarily are not of sound mind.<br\/><br\/>The Civil Code has followed the principle, as being the most rational one, that all persons, unless they have been previously disqualified by the courts, are presumed to be of sound mind as long as the party alleging their disqualification does not show and establish the contrary.<br\/><br\/>In these proceedings no evidence whatever has been furnished by the opponent, Pedro Cabigting, tending to show that the testatrix was not of sound mind when she executed her will on the afternoon of January 12, 1908.\u00a0 On the contrary, the presumption that she was is corroborated by the certificate of the physician who attended her and was present at the execution of the will in question, and by the testimony of the said physician, of Attorney Emiliano Kerr, and of the witness Teodoro Jurado who, by order of the testatrix, signed for her and affixed her name to the will, wherefore it is unquestionable that Felicitas Cabigting was legally qualified at the time of executing said will.<br\/><br\/>As to the form in which the will was executed there is no reason for refusing to accept the finding of the court below to the effect that\u00a0 said will had been executed in accordance with the formalities and requisites required by section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as found in the last two paragraphs of said testament.\u00a0 If the execution of the same is found to be in accordance with the law, it should be admitted to probate forthwith.\u00a0 As stated in the judgment appealed from, no well founded opposition appears in the proceedings, and in addition thereto the court rightly held that said opposition was devoid of legal foundation for the reason that the said Pedro Cabigting failed to establish his legal capacity and right as a party in interest in the hereditary succession of the said Felicitas Cabigting.\u00a0 In the present instance it is neither possible nor permissible to admit the theory of the appellant that from the mere fact that he had impugned said will and objected to its authentication, it should be presumed that he was an interested party with legal capacity therefor.\u00a0 Such a theory would be absurd and is unsupported by the law or by the established rule of courts.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, and accepting the considerations contained in the judgment appealed from, it is our opinion that the same should be, and is hereby affirmed with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Juana Valencia (9 Phil. Rep., 322) had been entered, the record was returned to the court below where an execution was issued directing the sheriff to put the plaintiff in that suit, who is the defendant in this suit, in possession of the real property there in question.\u00a0 The defendant in that suit, who is the plaintiff in this suit, then brought this action, asking that she be not ejected from the property until the defendant had paid her for the improvements which she had made thereon, which she alleged were of the value of P8,000.\u00a0 A preliminary injunction was granted restraining the eviction until the termination of the suit.\u00a0 The defendant\u00a0 in her answer set up a counterclaim for the use and occupation of the premises from the 1st day of September, 1901.\u00a0 The judgment of the court below acquitted the defendant of the complaint and ordered judgment against the plaintiff on the counterclaim for the sum of Pl5 a month as rent from the 1st day of September, 1901.\u00a0 From this judgment the plaintiff has appealed.<br\/><br\/>Article 453 of the Civil Code is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Necessary expenses are refunded to every possessor, but only the possessor in good faith may retain the thing until they are repaid to him.<br\/><br\/>\"Useful expenses are paid the possessor in good faith with the same right of retention, the person who has defeated him in his possession having the option of refunding the amount of the expenses or paying him the increase in value the thing has acquired by reason thereof.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>So far as the plaintiff's claim to recover for the improvements is based upon the first paragraph of this article, it cannot be sustained.\u00a0 The improvements consisted in filling lot and erecting a house thereon.\u00a0 The term \"necessary expenses\" was considered in this court in the case of Alburo <i>vs<\/i>. Villanueva (7 Phil. Rep., 277), and it was there held that the filling in and improvement of a lot could not be brought under this head.\u00a0 The construction of the house, of course, could not, because that was not at all necessary for the preservation of the lot.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff's principal reliance is, however, upon the second paragraph of article 453, and her claim is that she was a possessor in good faith.\u00a0 The status of the plaintiff with reference to this property was conclusively settled by the decision in the former case.\u00a0 (Sec. 306, Code of Civil Procedure.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In that case it was said (9 Phil. Rep., 324) :<br\/><blockquote>\"We hold in this case that the defendant did not occupy this land as owner, but was there by the mere tolerance of the plaintiff, and, consequently, that she, the defendant, has not acquired the ownership thereof.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The question whether a person who occupies by the mere tolerance of the owner is entitled to recover for improvements, has already been decided by this court.\u00a0 In the case of De Guzman <i>vs<\/i>. Rivera (4 Phil. Rep., 620), the court said (p. 624) :<br\/><blockquote>\"From the foregoing it follows that the plaintiff occupied the land unlawfully and by mere tolerance of the actual owners thereof.\u00a0 She did not acquire when she bought the house any more rights than those which the former tenant had.\u00a0 She acted in bad faith when she instituted this action and she can not now avail herself of the provisions of articles 361 and 434 and other corresponding articles of the Civil Code.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Without considering the other objections raised to the complaint, we hold that it can not be maintained because the plaintiff was not an occupant in good faith.<br\/><br\/>The only evidence in the case to show the value of the use of the land occupied by the plaintiff from the 1st of September, 1901, is the following agreement made by the parties at the trial:<br\/><blockquote>\"The parties agree that the lot next to the lot mentioned in the complaint, occupied by the Chinese Pio Barretto, pays as rent to Do\u00f1a Carmen Ayala P237 a month for an area of 4,000 meters.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The lot occupied by the plaintiff has an area of 479.49 square meters.\u00a0 There is no evidence to show whether the location of the lot occupied by Barretto is better or worse than the situation of the lot occupied by the plaintiff.\u00a0 There is no evidence to show what the natural features of the two properties are so that it can not be said that one is just as valuable as the other for the purposes of leasing.\u00a0 The mere isolated fact that one piece of property is actually rented for a certain sum of money is not sufficient evidence of the value of the use of an adjoining piece of property without some evidence to show that they are similarly situated and that one, for the purposes of renting, has the same value as the other.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below acquitting the defendant of the complaint is affirmed.\u00a0 It is reversed so far as it orders judgment against the plaintiff for ?15 a month from the 1st day of September, 1901, and the plaintiff is hereby acquitted of the counterclaim contained in the defendant's answer.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed to either party in this court.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

S., 124; The \"Edwin I. Morrison,\" 153 U. S., 199); and the mere fact that a strong wind was blowing when the boat changed its course is not in itself sufficient to excuse her owners for losses incurred as a result of so poor an execution of this maneuver as to result in sinking her.\u00a0 In the absence of proof of such a violent storm or such an\u00a0 exceptionally high sea that, despite the proper equipment of the boat and the exercise of due skill and diligence by the patron and crew, those in charge of the boat were overpowered by the force of the elements, we do not think that the sinking of the boat can justly be said to have been the result of an act of God or of an unvoidable accident; the blowing of strong winds must always be anticipated by men who go down into the sea in ships, and in the absence of evidence of some unusual intervening cause, we must hold that the exercise of due diligence in the performance of their duty by the patron and the members of his crew, had they been reasonably expert as seafaring men, could have and would have avoided the accident which actually occurred, provided the boat was suited to the work required of her.<br\/><br\/>We would not be understood as holding that ships and boats are not sometimes lost as a result of unavoidable accident or an act of God when storms are not raging and even when the sea is comparatively calm.\u00a0 Instances of such losses are of frequent occurrence.\u00a0 Losses resulting from an accident caused by a sudden and unexpected gust of wind have under some circumstances been held to be attributable to an act of God (11 111., 519; 95 Penn., 287); and the books contain many instances of losses attributed\u00a0 to an act of God or inevitable accident, other than those resulting from the action of storms and high seas, but it will be found that in all such cases the evidence introduced at the trial sustains a finding that the loss was due to exceptional circumstances or conditions, beyond the control of those who would otherwise be responsible for the loss, notwithstanding the exercise of due diligence, foresight, pains and care to avoid it; and, as has been said, mere proof that a strong wind is blowing when a properly manned and equipped sailing boat tacks its course is not sufficient to sustain such a finding.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

THE MUNICIPALITY OF VICTORIA, PROVINCE OF TARLAC, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On January 17, 1908, the representative of Mgr. Jeremiah J. Harty, archbishop of the Roman Catholic Church, as the legal administrator of all the properties and rights of the Catholic Church within the archbishopric of Manila, filed a written complaint in the Court of First Instance of Tarlac against the municipality of Victoria, alleging that the parish of the said town had been and was then the owner of a parcel.of land within the said municipality, known as the <i>plaza<\/i> of the church of Victoria; that it had acquired said parcel of land more than sixty years previously, and had continued to possess the same ever since up to 1901, in which year the defendant municipality unlawfully and forcibly seized the said property, claiming to be entitled thereto and retaining it to the\u00a0 present day.\u00a0 For the purposes of the complaint, a description of the metes and bounds of the land in question was set forth in the writing, and plaintiff prayed that, in view of what was therein\u00a0 set forth, judgment be entered holding that the said land was the property of the parish of Victoria, of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, and that the defendant be ordered to vacate the same and to pay the costs of the action.<br\/><br\/>The defendant municipality answered the complaint through its attorney and offered a general denial of all the facts stated therein, especially of those numbered 4, 5, 6, and 7; in special defense it alleged that the <i>plaza<\/i> described in No. 4 of the complaint was founded when the sitio denominated Canarum, a barrio of the town of Tarlac, was converted into a civil town in 1855; that the parish of Tarlac was established many years after the civil town, and that therefore, it neither had then, nor has now any title to the <i>plaza<\/i> claimed, and that the complaint injured the defendant, and for this reason it prayed that judgment be entered absolving the defendant of the complaint with costs and\u00a0 damages against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Evidence was adduced by both parties, and the documents exhibited,\u00a0 to one of which the plaintiff objected, were made of record; the trial court rendered judgment on the 15th of June, 1908, holding that the parish of Victoria of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, had a better right to the possession of the land described in the complaint, and sentenced the defendant to vacate the same and to pay the costs.\u00a0 To said judgment the representative of the defendant excepted and moved for a new trial on the ground that it was contrary to the weight of the evidence, and he notified the court that, if his motion were overruled, he would appeal to the Supreme Court.\u00a0 The motion for a new trial was overruled; the defendant excepted, and presented the corresponding bill of exceptions which, after receipt of a copy had been acknowledged by the adverse party, was approved.\u00a0 On the 1st of September last, the appellant was ordered to furnish bond in the sum of P1,000 to insure the fulfillment of the judgment in the event that it should\u00a0 be totally or partially, affirmed.\u00a0 To said order the defendant excepted, but furnished the bond as directed by the court.<br\/><br\/>In view of the nature of the action brought by the plaintiff against the municipality of Victoria, Province of Tarlac, the question that has arisen between the contending parties consists only in determining who is the owner and proprietor of the parcel of land that surrounds the parish church of the said town, and which is called the public <i>plaza<\/i> of the same.<br\/><br\/>Article 339 of the Civil Code reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Property of public ownership\u00a0 is:<br\/><br\/>\"1.\u00a0 That destined to the public use, such as roads, canals, rivers, torrents, ports, and bridges constructed by the State, and\u00a0 banks, shores, roadsteads, and that of a similar character.\" <\/blockquote> Article 344 of said code also reads;<br\/><blockquote>\"Property for public use in provinces and in towns comprises the provincial and town roads, the squares, streets, fountains, and public waters, the promenades, and public works of general service supported by the said towns or provinces.\" <\/blockquote> From the evidence presented by both parties it appears that the town of Victoria, which was formerly only a barrio of the town of Tarlac and known as Canarum, was converted into a town in 1855, and named Victoria; to this end they must have laid out the streets and the plaza of the town, in the center of which were situated the church and parish house from the commencement, and at the expiration of about twelve years the parish of said town was constituted and the priest who was to perform the office of curate was appointed; that from the very beginning, the large tract of land that surrounds the church and the parish house was known as a public <i>plaza<\/i>, destined to the use of all the residents of the recently founded town; public performances and religious processions were held thereon without hindrance either on the part of the local authorities or of the curate of said town.<br\/><br\/>It must be assumed that the principal residents of the old barrio, being interested in the conversion of the barrio into a civil town, arranged in such a way that the barrio, as the center of the future town which was subsequently called Victoria, should have streets and a public <i>plaza<\/i>, with its church and parish house, and also a <i>tribunal<\/i> or building destined for the use of the municipality and the local official at that time called the <i>gobernadorcillo<\/i> and later\" on <i>capitan municipal<\/i>, as has occurred in the foundation of all the towns in these Islands, under the old administrative laws.<br\/><br\/>It may be true that the father of the witness Casimiro Ta\u00f1edo, who owned the space of land where the church and parish house were erected, had voluntarily donated it to the Catholic Church, the only one known at the time, but proper proof is lacking that the donation affirmed by the said Ta\u00f1edo comprehended the whole of the large tract which at the present time constitutes the <i>plaza<\/i> of the town.<br\/><br\/>It was a custom observed by all the towns established administratively in these Islands under the old Laws of the Indies, that on their creation, a certain amount of land was always reserved for <i>plazas<\/i>, commons, and special and communal property, and as it is unquestionable that the said large space of land was left vacant in the center of the town of Victoria when it was constituted as a civil town, more than twelve years prior to the appointment of a permanent curate therein, there are good grounds to suppose that the late Vicente Ta\u00f1edo donated the land now occupied by the church and parish house in said municipality for religious purposes, or to the church, but not to the parish curate, because at the time there was no curate at the new town of Victoria.<br\/><br\/>Even though all the remaining space of land which now forms the great <i>plaza<\/i> of the town of Victoria had been owned by the said Ta\u00f1edo, it must be presumed that he waived his right thereto for the benefit of the townspeople, since from the creation or establishment of the town, down to the present day, all the residents, including the curate of said town, have enjoyed the free use of said <i>plaza<\/i>; it has not been satisfactorily shown that the municipality or the <i>principales<\/i> of the town of Victoria had donated the whole of said land to the curate of Victoria or to the Catholic Church, as alleged, nor could it have been so donated, it being a public <i>plaza<\/i> destined to public use and was not of private ownership, or patrimony of the town of Victoria, or of the Province of Tarlac.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that, among other things, <i>plazas<\/i> destined to the public use are not subject to prescription.\u00a0 (Art. 1936, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>That both the curates and the <i>gobernadorcillos<\/i> of the said town procured fruit trees and plants to be set out in the <i>plaza<\/i>, does not constitute an act of private ownership, but evidences the public use thereof, or perhaps the intention to improve and embellish the said plaza for the benefit of the townspeople.<br\/><br\/>Certain it is that the plaintiff has not proven that the Catholic Church or the parish of Victoria was the owner or proprietor of the said extensive piece of land which now forms the public <i>plaza<\/i> of said town, nor that it was in possession thereof under the form and conditions required by law, inasmuch as it has been fully proven that said <i>plaza<\/i> has been used without let or hindrance by the public and the residents of the town of Victoria ever since its creation.\u00a0 For the above reasons it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and that it should be held, as we do hereby hold, that the whole of the land not occupied by the church of the town of Victoria and its parish house, is a public <i>plaza<\/i> of the said town, of public use, and that in consequence thereof, the defendant is absolved of the complaint without any special ruling as to the costs of both instances.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

THE PASIG IRON WORKS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The plaintiff is a stockholder in the incorporated company (<i>sociedad anonima<\/i>), known as the \"Pasig Iron Works,\" and hereinafter referred to as the company, and secured the appointment of a receiver for the company on the 10th day\u00a0 of October, 1907, under the\u00a0 provisions of section 176 of the Code of Civil Procedure, on the ground of its actual or threatened insolvency.\u00a0 Thereafter, by virtue of an agreement between the various interested parties and under orders and instructions of the court, the receiver sold all the tangible property of the company, collected the outstanding debts, as they appeared on the books, and on the 11th day of March, 1908, filed a report of his conduct of the business of the company, and at the same time prayed for authority to pay its debts, as set out in the report, and thereupon to be discharged from the duties of his office.\u00a0 On the same day the trial court issued an order setting the hearing upon the report and the motion for its approval for the 14th day of March, 1908.\u00a0 Thereafter the date of the hearing was continued until March 21, when the plaintiff appeared in person and stated verbally that he could show many reasons why the said report\u00a0 should not be approved, and asked to be permitted to submit evidence in support of his objections.<br\/><br\/>The hearing was thereupon continued until Tuesday of March 24, and the court orally instructed the plaintiff to submit his objections in writing before noon of that day.\u00a0 At nine o'clock on the morning of the 24th of March, plaintiff filed in the clerk's office a protest in writing objecting to the\u00a0 approval of the report, basing his objections principally upon the lack of proof in the record in support of the claim of the Philippine Transportation and Construction Company, hereinafter referred to as the Transportation Company, for P2,624.80, Philippine currency, set out in the receiver's report.\u00a0 Plaintiff did not appear in person or by attorney to contest the motion for the approval of the receiver's report, nor did he take any further action until the 4th day of April, 1908, when he filed a motion praying that the court set aside its order approving the final report of the receiver, and set a date for the taking of testimony in support of his objections to the claim of the Transportation Company; and praying at the same time that the court vacate a certain judgment entered in the course of these proceedings on March 6, 1908, in favor of the Transportation Company and against the Pasig Iron Works, for the amount set out in the receiver's report.<br\/><br\/>The receiver, immediately upon the issuance of the order of March 24 affirming and approving his account, paid all the claims against the company set out in the report, including that of the Transportation Company, and on March 25, 1908, turned over a balance of P172.36 in his hands to the clerk of the Court of First Instance of Manila; on the 7th day of April, an order was issued discharging the receiver arid exonerating his bond, \"there appearing no longer any reason for continuing the receivership.\"\u00a0 On the same day, the trial court overruled plaintiff's motion to vacate the order approving the receiver's account, and to set aside the judgment in favor of the Transportation Company.\u00a0 To this order the plaintiff excepted, and brings the record here for review on his duly perfected bill of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff and appellant makes\u00a0 the following assignment of errors:<br\/><blockquote>\"(1)\u00a0 The court erred in rendering judgment in favor of the Philippine Transportation and Construction Company, because:<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 This plaintiff, as a party to the record, had no notice whatever of either a presentation of said claim, nor of any<br\/>proceeding thereon;<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 There was no presentation or hearing of said claim as required by law.<br\/><br\/>\" (2)\u00a0 The court erred in denying plaintiff's motion to set aside said judgment in favor of said Philippine Transportation and Construction Company, because:<br\/><br\/>\"(a)\u00a0 The clear and positive showing against the validity of said claim made upon the opposition to the approval of the receiver's report, and upon the motion to set aside said judgment, was in no way contradicted.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 The judgment in question, as to this plaintiff, was<br\/>at most a default judgment irregularly taken, and it was an abuse of discretion upon the part of the court to refuse to set it aside.<br\/><br\/>\" (3)\u00a0 The court erred in refusing to set aside its approval of the so-called final report of the receiver, because:<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 The receiver had wholly failed to comply with his first duty under section 176 of the Code of Civil Procedure, namely, to collect the debts and property due and belonging to the corporation.<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 Such an <i>ex parte<\/i> and summary disposition of the business and property of the corporation as was made in this case amounts to a taking of property without due process of law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It appears from the record that a few days prior to the filing of the receiver's report, the receiver together\u00a0 with one Burlingame Johnson representing the Transportation Company, appeared in open court, without previous notice to any of the other parties in interest, and that Johnson, on behalf of the Transportation Company, then and there orally submitted a claim for $1,312.40, United States currency, together with evidence satisfactory to the court that such claim was due as a balance on account between the Transportation Company and the defendant company; and that the receiver having recommended the allowance of the claim, the court directed that judgment be entered in favor of the Transportation Company for the sum of P2,624.80.\u00a0 It is to this judgment, and to the order overruling plaintiff's motion to set it aside, that the plaintiff's first and second assignments of error are directed.<br\/><br\/>There can be no doubt that the trial court erred in rendering judgment in favor of the Transportation Company in the summary manner above set out, without notice to the plaintiff who was a party to the record.\u00a0 It is true that while the provisions of section 176 of the Code of Civil Procedure direct the payment of the debts of a corporation committed to the hands of a receiver, no particular form of procedure is prescribed whereby such debts are to be ascertained and paid; but whatever proceeding may be<br\/>adopted looking to this end, claims against the corporation should not be approved and paid without some formal and regular proceeding whereby their justice and correctness may be inquired into, after due and reasonable notice to all parties in interest, who should be given a reasonable opportunity to present objections to the admission and to the payment of such claims, and to offer evidence in support of their objections.<br\/><br\/>We do not undertake at this time to determine the form which such proceedings should take, but whether the court itself undertakes to hear all claims against the corporation after due notice to the various parties in interest, or whether the receiver undertakes to\u00a0 determine these questions for himself, it is clear\u00a0 that no such claims should be paid by the receiver or approved and ordered paid by the trial court until all parties in interest have had an opportunity to submit their objections thereto and to secure a full and complete judicial review of the action of the court or of the receiver in this regard.\u00a0 It is hardly necessary to add that for this purpose notice to the receiver can not be regarded as sufficient notice to the various parties interested.<br\/><br\/>One of the plaintiff's principal objects in instituting these proceedings appears to have been to prevent the payment of the claim of the Transportation Company to a balance due on account with the defendant company; nevertheless, the court, in a summary proceeding, without notice to him and without affording him an opportunity to be heard, gave judgment for the full amount of its claim in favor of the Transportation Company.\u00a0 Manifestly such judgment was not binding on the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>We think, however, that while it was undoubtedly error for the trial court to proceed to a hearing of the claim of the Transportation Company, without reasonable notice to the parties in interest, and without providing some formal and orderly proceeding for the determination of the claim, whereby any party in interest who believed himself aggrieved by the action of the court in that regard could secure judicial review of its action, nevertheless, in the light of after events, it must be regarded as error without prejudice so far as appellant is concerned.\u00a0 It appears that after judgment was entered the receiver filed his final report wherein was set out the claim of the Transportation Company; that plaintiff had full notice of the motion for the approval of that report and of the prayer of the receiver for an order directing him to pay the claims therein set out; that while he filed a written objection to the report, he failed to appear either in person or by attorney to support his objection; and that the court at the time and place appointed for the hearing, upon the motion of the receiver for the approval of his report, did in fact approve that report, and ordered the payment of the debts of the Transportation Company, as therein set out.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff had full opportunity, had he so desired, to appear and resist the claim to which he objected, and having wholly failed so to do or to offer any sufficient excuse for his absence at the time appointed for the consideration of the motion to approve the receiver's report, he was not entitled to come in a week thereafter, and have the report set aside on his bare allegation that if he had an opportunity to be heard, he could satisfy the court that one of the claims set out in the report should not be paid.\u00a0 Had he appeared in due time and objected to the approval of the report, it would have been the duty of the court to give him an opportunity to present witnesses in support of his contentions, and had the court then relied upon the judgment in the record or declined to hear his witnesses, he would clearly have been entitled to appeal from the action of the court in that regard.\u00a0 We must presume that had he thus appeared and informed the court that he had had no notice whatever of the hearing upon which the judgment was based, the court would forthwith have vacated said judgment, given the parties an opportunity to introduce evidence in support and in opposition to the claim, and in the absence of satisfactory proof, declined to approve the report in this regard.\u00a0 Admitting that the judgment complained of, in so far as it affects the plaintiff, was a nullity, and could not be supported upon appeal, its entry in the record without notice to the plaintiff can not be said to have prejudiced him, since he was given an opportunity thereafter to contest the claim, of which, by his own fault, he failed to take advantage.<br\/><br\/>The second assignment of error must also be disregarded on the grounds just stated, in so far as it is directed to the action of the court in declining to vacate the judgment in question.\u00a0 In so far as it goes to the action of the court in affirming receiver's report, we do not think plaintiff's contention can be sustained.\u00a0 It appears from the record in this case that the books of the Pasig Iron Works in the hands of the receiver showed an indebtedness upon account with the Transportation Company of the amount set out in the report, and in the absence of proof of fraud or mistake, we do not think we would be justified in reversing the ruling of the court approving the report of the receiver setting out this claim in the list of debts due by the company whose affairs he was administering.<br\/><br\/>The last assignment of error may be dismissed without much discussion.\u00a0 The receiver was appointed under the provisions of section 176 of the Code of Civil Procedure on the ground of the alleged insolvency of the company.\u00a0 It appears from the record that all the debts of the company have been paid and, all its tangible property has been disposed of, except a small cash balance now on deposit with the clerk of the court to the credit of the company.\u00a0 The object for which the receiver was appointed having been attained, the trial court properly discharged him.<br\/><br\/>The appointment and discharge of the receiver did not work a dissolution of the company, as claimed by\u00a0 appellant, and did not change the title or right of possession of the property, its corporate rights and the rights of the stock-holders being in nowise affected thereby., (186 (J. S., 223; 11 Colo., 464; 115 Ind., 466.)<br\/><br\/>The order of the court approving the report of the receiver and providing for his discharge, upon the payment of the debts set out therein, is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

GABINO SORIANO AND GERARDO VILLALOBOS, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This case being submitted to this court by virtue of the appeals respectively interposed by the two accused, it appears:<br\/><br\/>That Gabino Soriano appealed from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros sentencing him, as guilty of the theft of a carabao, to pay a fine of 1,875 pesetas and one-half of the costs, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of one day for every 12\u00bd pesetas that he failed to pay.<br\/><br\/>And that Gerardo Villalobos in his turn appealed from that part of the judgment which \"orders the return to Candido Montilla of the carabao in question, deposited with the said Villalobos whose right of action against Gabino Soriano is reserved.\"<br\/><br\/>As to Gabino Soriano, he appealed from the judgment because he was charged with criminal participation in the act; the court below considered that his participation in the commission of the crime was that of an abettor for the reason that he profited by the carabao, although it was not proven that he was guilty as principal of the appropriation.\u00a0 But in one of its findings of fact the court below held:\u00a0 (1) That on the 24th of February, 1905, Gabino Soriano obtained the registration of the carabao in the municipality of Silay, and that on the <i>same day<\/i> he transferred it by sale to Gerardo Villalobos for the\" sum of P150; and (2) that Miguel Tionco, who was municipal treasurer of Silay, declared that at the time of registration of the carabao, Gabino Soriano produced an old certificate, issued in the time of the Spanish Government, but did not give any particulars as to the town or the date on which the document had been issued, and said that he returned the said document to Soriano in order that he might attach it to his certificate of ownership as provided in the new law.\u00a0 And finally, the new law referred to by Tionco is Act No. 1147 of the Philippine Commission, section 9 of which provides that persons charged with the duty of branding or registering large cattle and issuing the proper certificates, shall satisfy themselves of the ownership of the cattle so branded or registered.\u00a0 And it has been fully proven that in addition to the original brand of the real owner, Candido Montilla, the accused, placed his own brand, that is, his initials, on the carabao in question.<br\/><br\/>Given these facts and the settled rule of this court, the fact that a number of stolen carabaos were found in the possession of an individual who kept them hidden away, and that a few days prior to the recovery thereof he had altered or modified the old marks on the animals, gives rise to the presumption that said individual was the principal in the crime, and not merely an accessory, unless it be satisfactorily proven that it was another person who stole the carabaos. (U S. <i>vs<\/i>. Jamero, 10 Phil. Rep., 137.) His participation as an accessory, as found in the judgment appealed from, can not be admitted; he must be considered as principal in the crime as sustained by the Attorney-General in this instance; therefore, lie is guilty as principal in the crime of theft as denned by paragraph 3 of article 518 of the Penal Code, applied by the court below.<br\/><br\/>But it was also found in the judgment appealed from that Gabino Soriano had been sentenced by the same court for tins same1 crime of theft of carabaos in cases Nos. 131, 164, 185, 235, 238, and 285, and was then serving sentence in three of the cases.\u00a0 In this case the aggravating circumstance No. 18 of article 10, that is, that the culprit is a recidivist, should be considered, and it is so considered in the judgment appealed from; but then article 520 should be applied\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"Theft shall be punished with penalties next higher in degree to those respectively prescribed in the two preceding articles:<br\/><br\/>\"1. *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"3. If the culprit were a recidivist two or more times.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The penalties imposed by paragraph 3 of article 518 for the crime herein are <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its medium degree to <i>presidio correccional<\/i> in its minimum degree; hence the penalties next higher are <i>presidio correccional<\/i> in its medium degree to <i>presidio mayor<\/i> in its minimum degree.\u00a0 Therefore, the medium degree of this penalty should be imposed on him, which we determine to be five years of <i>presidio correccional<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the appeal of Gerardo Villalobos, it is based on the allegation that the court below erred in ordering that the stolen carabao be returned to its lawful owner, Candido Montilla, without reimbursing Gerardo Villalobos for its value, notwithstanding the fact that he was fully acquitted and declared to be the possessor and purchaser thereof in good faith, and holding title in accordance with Act No. 1147.<br\/><br\/>It is true that he was acquitted; for the judgment appealed from says \"A reasonable doubt as to his guilt exists in the mind of the court'' for the reason that it was not proven that he was aware of the unlawful origin of the animal.\u00a0 \"Apparently, the carabao was lawfully acquired by Villalobos, but, notwithstanding this, the true owner, Candido Montilla, is entitled to recover it, inasmuch as the acquisition by Villalobos is null and void, because the supposed vendor is not the real owner of the animal.\"<br\/><br\/>What does not appear to be equally certain is that the court below held that he was a possessor and purchaser in good faith; the only thing that the court below said is, that it does not agree with the opinion of the defense \"<i>even<\/i> admitting that the carabao was acquired in good faith.\"<br\/><br\/>Had Villalobos acquired it in good faith at a public sale, he would be entitled to reimbursement by the real owner upon recovery by the latter; but the third purchaser in this case, Villalobos, did not obtain the animal at a public sale, but by private purchase from Soriano.\u00a0 The registration of the purchase and transfer in the books of a municipality does not confer a public character upon a sale agreed to between two individuals only, without previous publication of notice for general information in order that bidders may appear.\u00a0 Therefore, the finding contained in the judgment impugned on this appeal is entirely in accordance with the law, that is, with the provisions of articles 120 of the Penal Code, and 464 of the Civil Code for which reason this part of the judgment appealed from should be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, the said judgment is reversed as far as concerns the penalty imposed on Gabino Soriano as an accessory, and we hereby sentence him to five years of <i>presidio correccional<\/i> with the accessories of article 58 of the Penal Code and one-half of the costs of both instances ; and we affirm the said judgment as to the restoration of the stolen carabao to its lawful owner, Candido Montilla, without right on the part of Gerardo Villalobos to first obtain reimbursement for the value thereof; his right of action, in accordance with the judgment, is reserved and he is hereby sentenced to pay one-half of the costs of this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Willard<\/i>, and <i>Tracey, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

No. 5069, October 25, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>TAN CHUCO, PLAINTIFF, APPELLANT AND APPELLEE, <i>VS.<\/i> YORKSHIRE FIRE AND LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, DEFENDANT, APPELLANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">Judgment in this action was rendered in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the plaintiff upon his claim under an \"open\" fire insurance policy for compensation to the full extent of the policy, for the alleged loss by fire of a certain stock of goods insured by the defendant company; and against the defendant company on its counterclaim for losses resulting from the plaintiff's alleged intentional and fraudulent setting on fire of the building wherein the insured goods were kept, thereby as it is alleged causing the destruction by fire of several stocks of goods belonging to third parties, and insured by the defendant company.<br\/><br\/>The trial court found that the evidence did not sustain defendant's allegation that plaintiff or his agents had intentionally and fraudulently set the building on fire, but was of opinion that not only had the plaintiff failed to establish the value of the goods which he alleges were destroyed by fire but that he had failed in several particulars to live up to the terms of his contract as set out in the policy, thereby voiding the policy and defeating his claim to indemnification thereunder.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff and defendant each appealed from so much of the judgment as is against their respective claims.<br\/><br\/>It is not denied that all of plaintiff's property which was within the building wherein, under the terms of policy, the insured goods were to be kept, was destroyed by fire as alleged in the complaint; and there is no question as to the defendant company's liability to indemnify the plaintiff, under his policy, for the amount of these losses, when duly established, unless it appears that plaintiff's right of recovery was defeated by some failure on\u00a0 his part to live up to the terms of his contract, as set out in the policy; nor is there any question of defendant's right to recover from the plaintiff upon its counterclaim, if it appears from the evidence that the plaintiff, as alleged by the defendant, intentionally and fraudulently set on fire, or caused to be set on fire the building wherein it is alleged the insured goods were kept.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of record strongly tends to sustain defendant's allegations that the plaintiff, although himself absent in China, caused the building in question to be set on fire, but the trial judge, in whose presence the witnesses testified, appears to have had some doubt as to the credibility of some of the witnesses called by the defendant, and was of opinion that these\u00a0 allegations were not satisfactorily established by the weight of the evidence.\u00a0 Upon a careful review of the whole record, and keeping in mind the fact that the trial judge saw and heard the witnesses testify, we are unable to say that there is such a preponderance of the evidence in support of these allegations as would sustain an affirmative finding in favor of the defendant, and justify us in reversing the finding by the trial court upon this issue.\u00a0 The judgment against the defendant company upon its counterclaim should therefore be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>The trial court was of opinion, however, that the building wherein the insured goods were stored having been destroyed by fire the origin of which is unknown, the plaintiff failed to prove the value of the insured goods, and that for the fraudulent purpose of\u00a0 recovering the full amount of the policy, he submitted fabricated written evidence and false testimony in support of his claim that the insured goods actually destroyed by fire were worth more than the total amount of the insurance thereon.\u00a0 Plaintiff introduced an inventory of the insured goods alleged to have been taken a short time before the fire, which would leave little room for doubt as to the truth of his allegation as to the amount of his loss if it could be accepted as genuine.\u00a0 But the trial judge was of opinion that this inventory was not genuine and that it had been fraudulently prepared with a view to its use as evidence in support of plaintiff's claim.\u00a0 He was led to reject this alleged inventory as unworthy of belief, partly because of the inherent improbability of the story told by the witnesses for the plaintiff who testified as to the conditions under which it was made and as to the manner in which it had been preserved from destruction, notwithstanding the fact that all other useful documentary evidence, books, and papers were lost in the fire; partly because: the unconvincing and unsatisfactory manner in which these witnesses testified; partly because the evidence of record tends to prove, though not conclusively, that the stock of insured goods at the time of the fire was considerably less than the total amount of the insurance thereon; and partly because the evidence conclusively establishes that defendant's manager and representative, who claims to have made this inventory, was in the building together with his employees when the fire took place, and not only made no effort to extinguish, the fire or to save the insured goods from destruction, although such efforts might have been availing, but that he failed to save from destruction any of the books or papers connected with the business of which he was in charge which would have served in any wise to corroborate the data contained in the alleged inventory, or to give any accurate information upon which a finding could be based as to the true value of the insured goods destroyed by the fire.<br\/><br\/>The inventory was dated as of the 1st of January, although it appears that it was not the custom of the plaintiff or his manager, who are Chinese persons, to make an inventory on the first day of the New Year under the Gregorian calendar, and no reason was given or suggested which would satisfactorily explain the making of the inventory upon that date on this particular occasion; while the fact that the plaintiff and owner of the store\u00a0 left for China in the month of November immediately prior thereto, and that the Chinese New Year occurs in the month of February, and that in the ordinary course of business, inventories, if taken at all, would naturally be taken upon those occasions, renders it, to say the least, highly improbable that a third inventory would, in the ordinary course of business, be taken within less than two months after the former, and two months before the latter date.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff's manager testified that after the taking of the inventory it was turned over to a friend who was about to leave for China to be taken to plaintiff, and he thus attempted to account for the fact that it was not destroyed together with the other books and documents relating to the business; but it appears that the friend to whom it had been intrusted had not yet departed for China in the month of February when the fire took place, so that the manager immediately after the fire was able to secure the return of the inventory for the purpose of making his report to the insurance company.\u00a0 No explanation was offered which would account for the remarkable conduct of plaintiff's manager in preparing an inventory less than two months after his employer had left for China and then instead of forwarding it at once by mail to his principal, intrusting it for transmission to a friend who had not left for China when the fire took place several weeks later.<br\/><br\/>Evidence was introduced at the trial which showed that as a result of adverse conditions in the sugar market the business of the plaintiff for some time prior to the fire was at a low ebb, and this evidence strongly tended to prove that because of these adverse business conditions the stocks of goods of the plaintiff, as well as those of all the Chinese merchants in the town wherein the fire took place, were far below the average at the time the fire occurred; and it was proven that not long before the fire the plaintiff had sought and secured a reduction in his rent, because of the admittedly adverse business conditions then existing.\u00a0 Plaintiff at the trial sought to corroborate the contents of the inventory by introducing copies of various alleged invoices of goods made to him during the course of several months preceding the fire, but these invoices, as the trial judge points out, not only failed to establish the fact that the goods were actually delivered to the building wherein the insured goods were kept, but amounting as they do to but a small fraction of the loss claimed by the plaintiff, tended rather to raise a doubt as to the probability of the existence in the store of such a stock of goods as is set out in the inventory, than to corroborate the truth of plaintiff's claims, since the plaintiff, who well knew the persons with whom he dealt, should not have found any serious difficulty in proving the purchase and delivery of any goods which may have been received by him prior to the fire and during the existence of the insurance contract.<br\/><br\/>We think that the action of the trial court in rejecting the proof offered by plaintiff as to the amount of the loss must be sustained, and the contract of fire insurance being a contract of indemnity, and the plaintiff only entitled therefore to recover the amount of the actual loss sustained by him, there being no express valuation in the policy, judgment was properly entered against him for lack of satisfactory proof of the amount of his loss.\u00a0 (Franklin F. Ins. Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Hamill, 6 Gill (Md.), 87; Marchesseau <i>vs.<\/i> Merchants Ins., Co., 1 Rob. (La.), 438; Eagle Ins. Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Lafayette Ins. Co., 9 Ind., 443.)<br\/><br\/>It is not necessary for us to examine the assignments of error by counsel for plaintiff appellant which are directed to the findings and conclusions of the trial court as to the failure of the plaintiff to live up to various provisions of the contract set out\u00a0 in the policy (which in the opinion of the trial court defeated plaintiff's right of recovery even had he established the amount of his loss with satisfactory evidence), because even if all these assignments of error were\u00a0 sustained, it would be our duty nevertheless to affirm the decision of the court below upon the grounds already set out.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from should be, and is, therefore, affirmed, without costs to either party.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

In not granting the appellant Ayala the wages corresponding to the subordinate crew employed by him on the ship, and who are unable to claim, by themselves, their salaries, on account of the small amount of the same and the wandering character of the life imposed upon them by their occupation.<br\/><br\/>\"VI.\u00a0 In granting the credit of the Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino a preference over a great part of those claimed by the appellant Ayala, which were expenses incurred for the maintenance and benefit of the vessel during the existence of the mortgage in favor of the bank.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>\u00a0El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino did not appeal from the judgment of the lower court and therefore whatever error may have been committed by the lower court to the prejudice of the said bank can not now be considered.<br\/><br\/>The claim of the defendant Manuel Ayala is based upon the theory that the wages of the crew and expenses incurred for the ship and furnishing supplies for the same have a preference over the claim of the other defendant, El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino.\u00a0 The defendant, the said Ayala, evidently bases his claim upon the provisions of articles 580 and 646 of the Code of Commerce.\u00a0 Article 580 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"In all judicial sales of vessels for the payment of creditors, the following shall have preference in the order stated:<br\/><br\/>\"1. The credits in favor of the public treasury which are accounted for by means of a judicial certificate of the competent authority.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The judicial costs of the proceedings, according to an appraisement approved by the judge or court.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The pilotage charges, tonnage dues, and the other sea or port charges, proven by means of proper certificates of the officers intrusted with the collection.<br\/><br\/>\"4. The salaries of the caretakers and watchmen of the vessel and any other expense connected with the preservation of said vessel, from the time of arrival until her sale, which appear to have been paid or are due by virtue of a true account approved by the judge or court,<br\/><br\/>\"5. The rent of the warehouse where the rigging and stores of the vessel have been taken care of, according to contract.<br\/><br\/>\"6. The salaries due the captain and crew during their last voyage, which shall be vouched for by virtue of the liquidation made from the shipping articles and account books of the vessel, approved by the chief of the bureau of merchant marine where there is one, and in his absence by the consul, or judge, or court.<br\/><br\/>\"7. The reimbursement for the goods of the freight the captain may have sold in order to repair the vessel, provided the sale has been ordered by a judicial instrument executed with the formalities required in such cases,'and recorded in the certificate of the registry of the vessel.<br\/><br\/>\"8. The part of the price which has not been paid the last vendor, the credits pending for the payment of material and work in the construction of the vessel, when it has not navigated, and those arising from the repair and equipment of the vessel and its provisioning with victuals, and fuel during its last voyage.<br\/><br\/>\"In order that said credits may enjoy the preference contained in this number, they must appear by contracts recorded in the commercial registry, or if they were contracted for the vessel while on a voyage and said vessel has not returned to the port where she is registered, they must be proven with the authority required for such cases and entered in the certificate of the record of said vessel.<br\/><br\/>\"9. The amounts borrowed on bottomry bonds before the departure of the vessel, proven by means of the contracts executed according to law and recorded in the commercial registry, the amounts borrowed during the voyage with, the authority mentioned in the foregoing number, filling the same requisites, and the insurance premium, proven by the policy of the contract or certificate taken from the books of the broker.<br\/><br\/>\"10. The indemnity due the shippers for the value of the goods shipped, which were not delivered to the consignees, or for averages suffered for which the vessel is liable, provided either appear in a judicial or arbitration decision.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>By reference to paragraph 6 of said article 580, as above quoted, it is seen that in all judicial sales of vessels the salaries due the captain and the crew during the last voyage shall be paid in accordance with the preferences mentioned in said article out of the proceeds of said ship.\u00a0 Article 646 of said Code of Commerce provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The vessel with her engines, rigging, equipment, and freights shall be liable for the pay earned by the crew engaged per month or for the trip, the liquidation and payment to take place between one voyage and the other.<br\/><br\/>\"After a new voyage has been undertaken, credits such as the former shall lose their right of preference.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>\u00a0This article creates a lien upon a ship in favor of the crew engaged in the operation of the same and this lien in favor of the crew takes certain preference in accordance with the provisions of said article 580.\u00a0 The wages due the crew and expenses incurred in maintaining the ship during the last voyage constitute a lien under the law and take preference over a lien created by giving the ship as security for money borrowed.\u00a0 The crew, therefore, under article 580 of the Commercial Code, for their wages, etc., for the last voyage, have a prior lien upon a ship, to the lien created in the present case by the chattel mortgage.\u00a0 Liens in favor of the crew under these circumstances are known as legal liens and whoever buys a ship or loans money and takes a chattel mortgage as security, takes the ship subject to such prior liens. In the present case the said mortgage was executed and delivered in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1508 of the Philippine Commission.\u00a0 The ship was sold by the sheriff of the city of Manila in accordance with the provisions of section 14 of that Act. Section 14 provides the method of disposing of the funds received under such a sale.\u00a0 The method is as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"The proceeds of such sale shall be applied to the payment, (1) of the cost and expenses of keeping and sale; (2) to the payment of the demand or obligation secured by such mortgage; (3) the residue shall be paid to persons holding subsequent mortgages in their order; and (4) the balance shall be paid to the mortgagor or person holding under him on demand.\"<br\/><br\/>It will be seen that there is no provision in the law for using the funds received in the sale of mortgaged property for the payment of amounts due on prior liens.\u00a0 The reason is plain why no such provision was made.\u00a0 It is that in no case can such a sale or a sale based upon the second mortgage or lien upon property affect in any way prior liens.\u00a0 To illustrate:\u00a0 Suppose that \"A\" held a mortgage against the ship in question, executed, delivered and recorded prior to the date of the mortgage executed, delivered, and recorded to and by El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino.\u00a0 Certainly the sale of the ship under the mortgage in favor of the second mortgagee could in no way affect the rights which \"A\" held against the ship and the purchaser under the sale of the mortgage in favor of El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino would take the ship subject to the claim which \"A\" held against the same.\u00a0 The lien which Manuel Ayala and the other members of his crew held against the said ship were exactly analogous to the claims of \"A\" in the above illustration.\u00a0 Therefore the sale of the ship under the mortgage in question in no way divested the lien which the law created in favor of the said Manuel Ayala and his crew against the ship in question. His remedy is, therefore, not against the money which was received under said sale, but against the ship by foreclosing his lien against the same.\u00a0 It is true that under a sale of personal property in accordance with section 14 of said Act, the sheriff has a right to pay the costs and expenses of <i>keeping<\/i> and <i>sale<\/i>, but we are not of the opinion that this relates to the cost of keeping and maintaining the ship prior to the time when the sheriff takes possession of it for the purpose of selling the same.<br\/><br\/>The Code of Commerce refers to two methods of sale:\u00a0 one a judicial and the other a voluntary sale.\u00a0 Article 580 provides how the funds received from a judicial sale shall be distributed and for the cancellation of liens held against the ship.\u00a0 But it can not be contended, even under the provisions of article 582, that by the mere fact that a ship has been sold under a judicial sale, the rights of prior lien holders, who were not parties to the procedure under which such sale took place, were foreclosed.\u00a0 The rights of persons not parties to a proceeding can not be affected thereby.\u00a0 Article 582 gives a certain time within which the creditors shall present and enforce their liens when the sale is a voluntary one.\u00a0 Articles 579 and 584 provide a method of collecting or enforcing not only the liens created under section 580 but also for the collection of any other kind of lien whatsoever.<br\/><br\/>The appellant alleges that the lower court committed an error in not allowing Manuel Ayala to collect the amount due the other members of the crew.\u00a0 The lower court denied the right of Ayala to collect the amount due the other members of the crew upon the theory <i>that he was not the real person in interest<\/i> and was not, therefore, permitted to collect the amount under section 114 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.\u00a0 The lower court allowed Ayala to collect the amount that was due him, as well as the amount which was due other members of the crew and which had been assigned to him. With reference to the amounts which had been assigned to him he <i>was the real party in interest<\/i> and, if he was entitled to recover at all he was entitled to recover not only what was due him but what had been assigned to him. But under no theory could he recover the amount due to the other-members of the crew whose claims had not been assigned to him.\u00a0 Said section 114 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions expressly provides that every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.\u00a0 This section of the code recognizes the assignments of rights of action and also recognizes that when one has a right of action assigned to him he is then the real party in interest and may maintain an action upon such claim or right.\u00a0 The purpose of section 114 is to require the plaintiff to be the real party in interest, or, in other words, he must be the person to whom the proceeds of the action shall belong, and to prevent actions by persons who have no interest in the result of the same.\u00a0 Of course the said section can not be construed to prohibit the maintenance of an action by one who is legally authorized to represent the real parties in interest.<br\/><br\/>In view of the fact that the defendant El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino did not appeal from the judgment of the lower court in which the defendant Manuel Ayala was allowed the sum of P756.66 out of the proceeds of the sale, we,make no change in the result of the decision in the lower court.<br\/><br\/>For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, without any special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Leonardo Santos et al. (7 Phil. Rep., 66), there were in the chapel in the barrio of Concepcion, in the pueblo of Tambobong in the Province of Rizal, images, ornaments, and jewels which had been there in use for many years.\u00a0 That action was brought to recover the possession of the chapel and it was decided in favor of the plaintiff.\u00a0 One of the witnesses in the case at bar testified that when the said decision of this court was known the property above mentioned disappeared from the chapel.\u00a0 This action was brought by the plaintiff, the archbishop of Manila, against the defendant to recover the possession of these images, jewels, arid other property alleged to belong to that chapel and formerly used therein.<br\/><br\/>At the trial the controversy was limited to the image of the Immaculate Conception and certain adornments used in connection therewith.\u00a0 The judgment finally entered was one in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the possession of the image only.<br\/><br\/>It was proven that the image had been in the possession of the Roman Catholic Church and had been used in the chapel in question for many years.\u00a0 The defendant admitted that he now had the image in his possession, but presented no evidence to show that he had any right to such possession.\u00a0 Upon the merits of the case the judgment must be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>The appellant, however, claims that the action can not be maintained for several reasons.<br\/><br\/>It is said by him that the Court of First Instance had no jurisdiction\u00a0 of this case because Act No. 1376 of the Commission confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court of all controversies of this character.\u00a0 Many cases have been brought to this court under the provisions of that Act; the first one to be decided being the case of the Roman Catholic Church <i>vs<\/i>. the Municipalities of the Province of Tarlac (9 Phil. Rep., 450).\u00a0 A conclusive answer to the appellant's contention is found in the last paragraph of section 8 of the Act, which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Provided, however<\/i>, That nothing in this Act contained shall prohibit the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, the Independent Filipino Church, or any municipality or other person not taking advantage of the provisions of this Act from instituting actions in the Courts of First Instance, or in the Court of Land Registration, in accordance with existing provisions of law, to recover the possession and control of churches, convents, cemeteries, or other property.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The phrase \"other property\" does not have the limited meaning given to it by the appellant and is not restricted to real estate.\u00a0 It evidently was intended to cover personal as well as real property.<br\/><br\/>It is also said that the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila had no jurisdiction of this action because the image was in the Province of Rizal, where the defendant resided.\u00a0 The image is an article of personal property and the place where an action relating thereto should be brought is determined by the\u00a0 provisions of section 377 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 By the terms of that section this action could be brought either in the province where the plaintiff resided or in the province where the defendant resided.\u00a0 The plaintiff residing in the city of Manila, the action was well brought in the Court of First Instance of that city.<br\/><br\/>It is further\u00a0 claimed that the complaint is insufficient because it does not allege the time when the defendant took possession of the property.\u00a0 This point was not raised by motion in the court below but by a demurrer.\u00a0 It is now suggested that, if the\u00a0 time when the defendant took possession of the property had been alleged, the complaint would, perhaps, have been demurrable on the\u00a0 ground that the statute of limitations had run in favor of the defendant.\u00a0 But it has already been held by this court that the statute of limitations is a defense which must be set up in the answer (Aldeguer <i>vs<\/i>. Hoskyn, 2 Phil. Rep., 500), and that it, can not be raised by a demurrer, (Domingo <i>vs<\/i>. Osorio, 7 Phil.

In other words, proof of possession for the statutory period, in the absence of any adverse claim, was to be taken by the Land Departments as equivalent to an establishment in detail of all the facts necessary to constitute a valid location.

Moreover, the defendant, equally with the plaintiffs, went through the course of taking testimony, preparing the case for hearing, and submitting it to the court for determination as a case pending in and before a court competent and adequate to adjudge the controversy.

The trial court rendered a judgment or decree granting an injunction as prayed. Exceptions were taken on the grounds that the findings of facts were against the weight of evidence, and that the judgment was against the law. The Supreme Court reexamined the evidence, and affirmed the decree below. Then the case was brought here by appeal.<\/p><p> The appellees make.a preliminary argument against the jurisdiction of this court, while the appellant asks us to reexamine the evidence, and to reverse the decree on the facts as well as the law. We cannot accede to either of these contentions. We are of opinion that this court has jurisdiction. For, if the affidavits of value should be held to apply to the whole of Reavis's claims, and not to only that part of them that are in controversy here, still, statute of the United States, namely, a section of the organic act (sec. 45, concerning mining titles in the Philippines), is \"involved,\" within the meaning of section 10 of the same act, which determines the jurisdiction of this court. Act of July 1, 1902, chap. 1369. 32 Stat. at L., 691, 695; U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1907, p. 214. The meaning and effect of that section are in question, and our construction even has some bearing upon our opinion that the findings of the two courts below should not be reopened. For, apart from the general rule prevailing in such cases, (De la Rama <em>vs.<\/em> De la Rama, 201 U. S., 303, 309; 50 L. ed., 765; 26 Sup. Ct. Rep., 485) we shall refer to the law for special reasons why those findings should not be disturbed in a case like this.<\/p><p> The appellees are Igorots, and it is found that, for fifty years, and probably for many more, Fianza and his ancestors have held possession of these mines. He now claims title under the Philippine Act of July 1, 1902, chap. 1369, sec. 45; 32 Stat. at L., 691. This section reads as follows:<\/p><blockquote><p> \"That where such person or association, they and their grantors have held and worked their claims for a period equal to the time prescribed by the statute of limitations of the Philippine Islands, evidence of such possession and working of the claims for such period shall be sufficient to establish a right to a patent thereto under this Act, in the absence of any adverse claim; but nothing in this Act shall be deemed to impair any lien which may have attached in any way whatever prior to the issuance of a patent.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> It is not disputed that this section applies to possession maintained for a sufficient time before and until the statute went into effect. See Soper <em>vs.<\/em> Lawrence Bros. Co., 201 U. S., 359; 50 L. ed., 788; 26 Sup. Ct. Rep., 473. The period of prescription at that time was ten years. Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, August 7, 1901, No. 190, sec. 40, 1 Pub. Laws of Philippine Commission, 378, 384. Therefore, as the United States had not had the sovereignty of the Philippines for ten years, the section, notwithstanding its similarity to Rev. Stat., sec. 2332, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1433, must be taken to refer to the conditions as they were before the United States and come into power. Especially must it be supposed to have had in view the natives of the Islands, and to have intended to do liberal justice to them. By section 16, their occupancy of public lands is respected and made to confer rights. In dealing with an Igorot of the Province of Benguet, it would be absurd to expect technical niceties, and the courts below were quite justified in their liberal mode of dealing with the evidence of possession and the possibly rather gradual setting of the precise boundaries of the appellees' claim. See Carino <em>vs.<\/em> Insular Government, 212 U. S., 449; 53 L. ed., 594; 29 Sup. Ct. Rep., 334. At all events, they found that the appellees and their ancestors had held the claim and worked it to the exclusion of all others down to the bringing of this suit, and that the boundaries were as shown in the plan that was filed and seems to have been put in evidence before the trial came to an end.<\/p><p> It cannot be said that there was no evidence of the facts found, for the plaintiff Fianza testified, in terms, that his grandfather and father had owned the mines in question, and that he and the other appellees owned, them in their turn; that they had all worked the mines, that no one else had claimed them, and that the appellant had interfered with his possession, and, when he put up a sign, had torn it down. No doubt his working of the mines was slight and superficial according to our notions, and the possession may not have been sharply asserted as it would have been with us, whether from Igorot habits or from the absence of legal title under Spanish law. But it sufficiently appears that the appellee's family had held the place in Igorot fashion, and to deny them possession in favor of Western intruders probably would be to say that the natives had no rights under the section that an American was bound to respect. Whatever vagueness there may have been in the boundaries, it is plain that the appellant attempted to locate a claim within them, and Fianza testified that the plan to which we have referred followed the boundaries that his father showed to him. It is said that the claim is larger than is allowed by section 22. But the limitation of that section applies only to claims \"located after the passage of this Act.\"<\/p><p> It is to be assumed, then, that the appellees and their ancestors had held possession and had worked their claims for much more than the period, required by section 45, before the moment when the statute went into effect. It is<\/p><p> to be assumed that the possession and working continued down to within two months of that moment. But the appellant says that he entered and staked his claims before that time and then was in possession of them. On this ground, as well as others that are disposed of by the findings below, he contends that there was an adverse claim within the meaning of the act. But the ground in question was not unoccupied, and therefore he could not make a valid claim under section 28. <em>See also<\/em> Act of March 2, 1901, chap. 803, 31 Stat. at L., 895, 910; U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2799. He refiled a location in October, 1902, but he did not and could not make the required affidavit because of the prior occupation; and, at that date, Fianza was within the act, unless he already had been deprived of its benefits. Moreover, it is found that Fianza's. possession continued down to the bringing of this suit. This is justified by the evidence, and is not contradicted by the bill. The bill, to be sure, alleges that Reavis, in 1900, illegally entered and deprived the appellees of their mines, and that he still continues to maintain his unjust claim. But further on it alleges that, in the spring of 1902, Reavis was directed by the Governor of Benguet not to molest the appellees; that he then waited in Manila, and, after the promulgation of the law, \"again entered,\" set stakes, and filed a notice of location. So that the bill does not mean that he was continuously in possession, or that he was in possession when the law took effect. We are of opinion that there was no adverse claim that would have prevented the appellees from getting a patent under section 45. (See Belk <em>vs.<\/em> Meagher, 104 U. S., 279, 284; 26 L. ed., 735, 737; Altoona Quicksilver Min. Co. <em>vs.<\/em> Integral Quicksilver Min. Co., 114 Cal., 100,105; 45 Pac, 1047. <em>See also<\/em> McCowan <em>vs.<\/em> Maclay, 16 Mont., 234, 239, 240; 40 Pac, 602.)<\/p><p> It is suggested that the possession of Fianza was not under a claim of title, since he could have no title under Spanish law. But, whatever may be the construction of Rev. Stat., sec. 2332, the corresponding sec. 45 of the Philippine Act cannot be taken to adopt from the local law any other requirement as to the possession than the length of time for which it must be maintained. Otherwise, in view of the Spanish and American law before July 1, 1902, no rights could be acquired, and the section would be empty words; whereas, as we have said before, another section of the Act, section 16, still further shows the intention of Congress to respect native occupation of public lands.<\/p><p> Again, it is urged that the section, of itself, confers no right other than to apply for a patent. But a right to an instrument that will confer a title in a thing is a right to have the thing. That is to say, it is a right of the kind that equity specifically enforces. It may or may not be true that, if the objection had been taken at the outset, the plaintiffs would have been turned over to another remedy, and left to apply for a patent; but, after a trial on the merits, the objection comes too late. (See Perego <em>vs.<\/em> Dodge, 163 U. S., 160, 164; 41 L. ed., 113, 116; 16 Sup. Ct. Eep., 971; Reynes <em>vs.<\/em> Dumont, 130 U. S., 354, 395; 32 L. ed., 934, 945; 9 Sup. Ct. Rep., 486.)<\/p><p> Some objections were taken to the exclusion of the evidence. But, apart from the fact that they do not appear to have been saved in the exceptions taken to the Supreme Court, and irrespective of its admissibility, the evidence offered could not have affected the result. An inquiry of Fianza, whether he claimed the mines mentioned in the suit or those measured by the surveyor who made the plan to which we have referred, was met by the allowance of an amendment, claiming according to the plan. A question to another of the plaintiffs, whether she saw any igorots working for Reavis, would have brought out nothing not admitted by the bill, that Reavis did, for a time, intrude upon the mines in suit. Upon the whole case we are of opinion that no sufficient ground is shown for reversing the decree, and it is affirmed.<\/p><p><em>Decree affirmed<\/em>.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><\/p><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\u00a0 <sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 215 U.

Saturnino complied with Soto's request and allowed his daughter to go to his neighbor's house to stay with the latter's wife.<br\/><br\/>Late that night the girl Clara woke up and asked Soto's wife to strike a light but the latter did not answer; thereupon Soto approached the girl, embraced her, and tried to raise her skirt and, as she had gotten up and was sitting on the bed endeavored to pull her down onto the floor; and as, in spite of her resistance and opposition, her aggressor persisted in his endeavor to lie with her and would not let her go, she cried out for help, whereupon Prudencio released her.\u00a0 Then the girl, as soon as she managed to find a box of matches, struck a light and from the <i>sala<\/i> of the house where she had been lying with the sick woman, saw her aggressor in the adjoining room in his undershirt.\u00a0 He, acknowledging his guilt, begged her to pardon him; but the injured girl after saying to the sick woman, the wife of the accused, who asked her what had happened, \"so this is the way you reward me for keeping you company,\" left the house, and weeping and with tumbled\u00a0 hair went to her own house where she informed her father of what had occurred.\u00a0 The latter at once went to the house of the aggressor who, however, was no longer there.\u00a0 Finding only the wife of the accused he inquired after her husband, to which she replied that he had just left.\u00a0 Next morning the girl appeared before the justice of the peace court and complained of the act committed by the accused.<br\/><br\/>As a result of the preliminary investigation a complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal on the 29th of September, 1908, charging Prudencio with the crime of attempted rape, and the corresponding proceedings having been instituted, the trial court, as a result thereof, entered judgment on the 9th of January, 1909, sentencing the accused to the penalty of four years two months and one day of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, to suffer the accessory penalties and to pay the costs; from said judgment the accused has appealed.<br\/><br\/>From the facts above stated it is deduced that the crime of attempted rape was actually committed on the person of Clara Nicanor, a girl about 16 years of age, late at night, and at the time when the said girl, with her father's permission, was in the house of the accused, by request of the latter that she stay with his wife who was sick, as he had to be away from his house on the night in question.<br\/><br\/>There is an attempt when the guilty person makes a beginning in the commission of a crime directly by overt acts, and does not perform all of the acts of execution which should constitute the crime by reason of some cause or accident other than his own voluntary desistance.\u00a0 (Art. 3, par. 3, Penal Code.)<br\/><br\/>According to the evidence in the case, Prudencio Soto, after pretending to be absent from his house on the night of the 20th of August, 1908, approached the injured girl, and taking advantage of the opportunity while she was sleeping close to and at the feet of his sick wife, embraced her and tried\u00a0 to lift up her skirt, endeavoring, when he noticed that she had arisen and was sitting on the bed for the purpose of opposing his intent, to lay her on the floor; as the culprit persisted in his intent to lie with her and refused to let her go, the injured girl cried out for help.\u00a0 When the girl managed to strike a light and recognized her aggressor, the latter, who was in his undershirt, ran into an adjoining room, and acknowledging his guilt, prayed the girl to pardon him, but she left the house and returned to her home for the purpose of informing her father of what had occurred.\u00a0 The accused also left his house, so that when Saturnino Nicanor called there in order to find out what had taken place the wife of the accused told him that her husband had just left.<br\/><br\/>The crime prosecuted herein is defined and punished by article 438 in connection with articles 3 and 66 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>The accused denied the charge and pleaded not guilty, but notwithstanding his exculpatory allegations and the affirmative testimony of the two witnesses offered by him in alibi, satisfactory and conclusive evidence establishes the actual commission of the crime and the guilt of its proven author, inasmuch as there is no reason for doubting the incriminating statements of the injured girl as confirmed by her father.\u00a0 The latter testified that his daughter, Clara Nicanor, appeared at his house late that night weeping and with her hair dishevelled, and that when he called at the house of the accused in order to find\u00a0 out what had occurred, the latter's wife informed him that her husband, Soto, had just left the house. This corroborates the charge and proves that as a matter of fact the accused had been in his house for the purpose of committing the would-be rape in question, and that when the injured girl left, he was still in the house.<br\/><br\/>The presentation by the defense of the document marked \"A\" does not constitute evidence of the innocence of the accused, or of the\u00a0 falsity of the charge, inasmuch as the injured girl signed the said document without a perfect knowledge of its contents, and without the assistance of her father; she was a minor, and simply adopted the suggestions of the municipal president of the town of whose services the accused perhaps availed himself in order to escape prosecution.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand the crime is already provided for in Act No. 1773, which provides that crimes which, according to the Penal Code, are of a private character shall be prosecuted <i>de oficio<\/i> and that the pardon of the aggrieved person shall not extinguish the liability of the guilty one except by subsequent marriage, which in the present case, can not be accomplished because the culprit is a married man.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime herein the presence of aggravating circumstance 10 of article 10 of the Penal Code must be considered for the reason that Prudencio Soto abused the confidence that Saturnino Nicanor had in him when he permitted his daughter, the aggrieved girl, to sleep that night in the house of the accused in order to bear his sick wife company; this aggravating circumstance is not counterbalanced in its effects by any mitigating one, for which reason the adequate penalty of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prision\u00a0 correctional<\/span> should be applied in its maximum degree.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, provided, however, that the culprit shall be sentenced to suffer the accessory penalties of article 61, and to pay the costs of this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

G. Irwin, are the same as Claus Spreckels &amp; Co. in whose favor the bond in question was executed.<br\/><br\/>The only evidence introduced at the trial to prove the identity of the plaintiffs in this action with the person or persons in whose favor the bond in question was executed is the original record in the former case including the bond itself.\u00a0 We think, however, that in the absence of proof to the contrary, this evidence sufficiently establishes their identity.\u00a0 The plaintiffs in this case are Claus Spreckels and Wm. G. Irwin, who allege that they are partners doing business in Honolulu under the firm name of Spreckels &amp; Co.\u00a0 The plaintiffs in the former case were Claus Spreckels and Wm. G. Irwin, who alleged that they were partners doing business in Honolulu under the firm name of Claus Spreckels &amp; Co.\u00a0 The identity of names raises a presumption of identity of persons, which, if not rebutted by proof to the contrary, becomes satisfactory, in accordance with the provisions of subsection 23 of section 334 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 The bond was executed in favor of Claus Spreckels &amp; Co., and keeping in mind the fact that the bond was executed in the course of the proceedings in the former case in consideration of a concession by the plaintiffs therein, we think that an examination of the language of the bond, and especially of the condition therein which makes express reference to \"the above-named plaintiffs\" (manifestly referring to the plaintiffs in the action in the course of which the bond was executed, and whose names appear as plaintiffs in the title prefixed to the bond), leaves no room for doubt that the name of Claus Spreckels &amp;'Co., in whose favor the bond was executed, was inserted in the bond by the defendants to designate the plaintiffs in that action and none other.\u00a0 The plaintiffs in that action being the same as the plaintiffs in the present action, we think the evidence of record sufficiently establishes the fact that the bond was executed by the defendants in favor of the plaintiffs in this action.\u00a0 It will be noted that in arriving at this conclusion, we have not deemed it necessary to look to the decision and judgment in the former action, wherein it is set out as a finding of fact that the plaintiffs were partners doing business under the firm name of Claus Spreckels &amp; Co., and we agree with appellant Hargis that, had it been necessary so to do, there might well be a question whether the findings of fact in the decision of the former case are binding upon him in this case, he not having been a party to that action.<br\/><br\/>In this connection it will be well to dispose of the point raised by the appellant Hargis, as to the right of plaintiffs to maintain this action and to have judgment in their favor, they having failed to establish by affirmative evidence their allegation that they are partners doing business under the firm name of Claus Spreckels &amp; Co.\u00a0 Hargis in his answer denied plaintiffs' allegation as to the partnership, and alleged that \"Claus Spreckels &amp; Co.\" is an unregistered corporation, and if we understand his contention aright, it rests on two grounds:\u00a0 first, that, in conformity with the provisions of the Corporation Law, the complaint should have been dismissed on the failure of plaintiffs to introduce evidence to prove that \"Claus Spreckels &amp; Co.\" is not an unregistered foreign corporation; and, second, that judgment should have been rendered in favor of defendants on plaintiffs' failure to establish the allegation of partnership.<br\/><br\/>So far as this defendant's contention rests on the provisions of section 69 of the Corporation Law, which denies to unregistered foreign corporations the right to maintain suits for the recovery of any debt, claim, or demand, it is sufficient to say that these provisions do not impose upon all plaintiff-litigants the burden of establishing by affirmative proof that they are not unregistered foreign corporations.\u00a0 That fact will not be presumed by the courts without some evidence tending to establish its existence.\u00a0 The plaintiffs are Claus Spreckels and Win. G. Irwin, who appear to be natural persons, and as such are entitled to institute any proper action in the courts in these Islands, and this defendant having failed to introduce any evidence whatever in support of his allegation that either the plaintiffs, or \"Claus Spreckels &amp; Co.\"'are in reality an unregistered foreign corporation, the trial court properly declined to dismiss the complaint on this ground.<br\/><br\/>As to the second contention, it is to be observed that the allegation that plaintiffs are partners doing business under the firm name of Claus Spreckels &amp; Co. is merely descriptive, and it having been proven that the bond was executed by the defendants in favor of the plaintiffs, the allegation as to the fact that they are partners doing business under the firm name of \"Claus Spreckels &amp; Co.,\" is immaterial, and failure to establish this fact in no wise affects their right to judgment in this case.<br\/><br\/>The principal ground upon which both appellants rely for a reversal of the judgment rendered in the lower court is that it appears from the record that the original case, No. 2550, was continued with the consent of plaintiffs therein after the expiration of the stipulated continuance of six months in consideration of which the bond was executed, without the express consent of the applicants, so that final judgment was not entered until the 17th day of July, 1906; and this notwithstanding the alleged fact that at the expiration of the six months' postponement originally agreed upon, the defendant Ward had returned to the Islands, and had in the Islands property sufficient to satisfy the judgment had such judgment been secured forthwith and execution issued thereon:\u00a0 Appellants lay special stress on an agreement of the parties in the original action for a continuance for an indefinite time entered into in January, 1906, which was the basis upon which the trial court issued the following order:<br\/><blockquote>\"This case having been set for trial on this day, and the parties having agreed to the postponement of such trial for an indefinite time, the same is hereby continued until the next term of court.\u00a0 So ordered.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is contended that the agreement to continue the trial for an indefinite time, in effect amounted to an extension of time to the original debtor to pay the promissory note, recovery of payment of which was the basis of the former action, and that this extension of time operated to release the appellants from the obligation of their bond.<br\/><br\/>Many American cases are cited in support of this contention, but we think that the authorities relied upon shed little light on the question under consideration, being for the most part limited to a discussion of the varying phases of the doctrine whereby, in certain cases, endorsers on negotiable instruments, and sureties on obligations to pay money are released where the payee or obligee in such instruments extends the time of payment without the consent of the endorser or surety.\u00a0 The appellants can not be considered in any sense as sureties on the promissory note which was sued on in the original action.\u00a0 Their obligation as sureties, is to pay the amount of the judgment in the original action in the event of the failure of their principal so to do, and is in many respects similar to that in an appeal or stay bond; and there being no question of an extension of the time to the principal creditor to pay the judgment <i>after it was obtained<\/i>, neither the cases cited nor the provisions of article 1851 of the Civil Code relied upon by appellants are applicable to the true issue involved.<br\/><br\/>There was no condition in the bond releasing the securities in the event that judgment was not obtained within a fixed period or in the event of failure to exercise diligence in the prosecution of the action, and in our opinion the execution of the bond in no wise deprived the parties to the original action of the right to do everything which is usually or necessarily done in the course of such proceed- ings.\u00a0 The court had the power upon the application of either party to grant continuances irrespective of the agreement of parties; and in the absence of allegation and proof of fraud or collusion between the plaintiffs and the defendant in the original action, we are of opinion that the fact that continuances were granted upon the stipulations of the parties was in no sense a violation of the obligation of the bond, for the undertaking of the sureties clearly and necessarily contemplated the possible exercise of the right to make such stipulations.\u00a0 It would be unreasonable and absurd to hold that the plaintiffs in the former action in agreeing to a continuance for the convenience of the defendant therein, agreed to sacrifice or surrender any of their rights as litigants in the proceedings had after the period of the agreed upon continuance had expired, and in the absence of a stipulation to the contrary they were clearly entitled to seek or to grant such further continuances as might be convenient or necessary.\u00a0 (Pearl <i>rs<\/i> Wellman, 11 111., 352; Railsback <i>vs<\/i>. Greve, 58 Ind., 72; Bailey <i>vs<\/i>. Rosenthal, 56 Mo., 385; Howell <i>vs<\/i>. Alma Milling Co., 3(J Neb., 80.)<br\/><br\/>Cases may perhaps arise wherein an unexplained continuance for an indefinite time might be sufficient to raise a presumption of fraud or collusion and to discharge the securities on such a bond as the one under consideration; and it is possible that mere failure to prosecute the action for a long period of time might operate, in some cases, to release securities on a bond of this nature, where the delay is so great as to justify a finding of a violation of an implied obligation upon the plaintiff to prosecute his claim with reasonable diligence; but in the case at bar, wherein there is no allegation in the pleadings of bad faith, collusion or fraud, and wherein the continuance more especially complained of only resulted in a delay of a few months, and the case was prosecuted to judgment in a little over two years, we are of opinion that neither of these reasons operated to release the securities, and that any loss incident to such delay, was necessarily contemplated in the undertaking.<br\/><br\/>What has been said disposes of all the points raised by appellants, and counsel for plaintiffs not having raised any objection in the court below to the provision of the judgment granting to the defendants the <i>beneficio de excusion<\/i>, to which it is suggested they are not entitled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed with costs against the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

P.,\" that being the brand used by the\u00a0 plaintiff on his stock for some thirty years past and duly registered by him as such in the municipality of San Isidro on the 4th day of May, 1904.\u00a0 In the month of July, 1907, a <i>caraballa<\/i> branded with the letters \"S. P.,\" and in addition thereto, the number 23, was found in the possession of the\u00a0 defendant, together with two of her calves some 2 or 3 years old.\u00a0 Plaintiff claims that this <i>caraballa<\/i> is the animal which disappeared\u00a0 from his hacienda in the year 1900; and in the month of August, 1907, he instituted these proceedings, wherein he prays for possession of the <i>caraballa<\/i>, together with her calves.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of the identity of the <i>caraballa<\/i> lost by the plaintiff with the <i>caraballa<\/i> found in the possession of the defendant is not wholly satisfactory, but it is not necessary for us to go into that question, because we are of opinion that the evidence of record conclusively establishes defendant's title to the animal by prescription, under the provisions of article 1955 of the Civil Code, which provide that the title to personal property prescribes by uninterrupted possession for three years in good\u00a0 faith (<i>con buena fe<\/i>).<br\/><br\/>Defendant\u00a0 proved by unimpeached documentary and oral evidence that he purchased the animal in question for the sum of P110 from one Guillermo Zamora on March 9, 1903; that Zamora purchased the animal for the sum of P110 from one Salvador Pangangban on February 27, 1903; and that Pangangban was the duly registered owner of the animal on March 30, 1901.\u00a0 Each of these transfers of ownership and the title of the various owners is evidenced by the necessary certificates of property and transfer-all apparently executed in accordance with the provisions of law in such cases.<br\/><br\/>It will be seen that more than the three years' prescriptive period had elapsed from the date when defendant purchased the animal, on March 9, 1903, until the date when plaintiff discovered her in the possession of defendant, and instituted these proceedings looking to her recovery (July-August, 1907).<br\/><br\/>The trial court was of opinion that proof of this uninterrupted possession by the defendant was not sufficient to establish his title by prescription, under the provisions of the above-cited article 1955 of the Civil Code, because in the opinion of the trial court, he failed to establish affirmatively that he had acquired, and held possession of the animal in good faith (<i>con buena fe<\/i>), as required by the provisions of that article.\u00a0 Under the provisions of article 434 of the Civil Code, however, \"good faith (<i>la buena fe<\/i>) is always presumed, and the burden of proof is upon the party alleging the bad faith of the possessor,\" and plaintiff offered no evidence whatever which tends to impeach the <i>bona fides<\/i> of defendant's alleged purchase of the animal or of his uninterrupted possession thereof from the date of the purchase until the date when this action was instituted; and we may add that in the total absence of proof to the contrary, defendant's documentary and oral evidence affirmatively established the <i>bona fides<\/i> of his purchase and possession.<br\/><br\/>The trial court appears also to have been of opinion that, in any event, the period for prescription provided in article 1955 did not begin to run as to the <i>caraballa<\/i> in question until the month of July, 1907, when plaintiff discovered for the first time the whereabouts of the animal which he claims to have lost in 1900.\u00a0 It is quite clear, however, from the provisions of article 1955, that the running of the period by virtue of which title of prescription may be acquired is coincident with the, period during which the thing has been in possession of him who claims ownership thereof by prescription, without regard to the time when a former owner may have lost possession or discovered the whereabouts of the thing lost; and in this connection, it is worthy of observation, that the provisions of article 1962, touching the prescription of actions for the recovery of possession of personal property, declare in express terms that the prescriptive period for such actions begins to run from the moment when the owner loses possession.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for plaintiff and appellee relies on appeal, more especially on the provisions of article 1956, which deny the right to acquire ownership of stolen property by prescription to the thief and his accomplices and accessaries in the commission of the\u00a0 crime before and after the fact.\u00a0 But there is not a particle of evidence in the record which tends to prove that this defendant was either a principal or an accomplice in the alleged theft of the animal from the plaintiff in 1900; the evidence upon which counsel for plaintiff relies, as to the alleged theft of the animal in question from the hacienda of the plaintiff in the year 1900, is not satisfactory, and there is no evidence whatever to connect this defendant or his predecessors in interest, as they appear from the certificates of registry, with the alleged theft, if it actually occurred.\u00a0 Counsel for plaintiff, relying upon various decisions of this court wherein we have held that the unexplained possession of stolen property a short time after the commission of the crime raises a presumption of guilt of the crime of theft against him\u00a0 who has the stolen property in his possession, contends that there is a presumption of guilt of the theft of the <i>caraballa<\/i> from the plaintiff, against Pangangban, arising out of his possession of the <i>caraballa<\/i> on March 30, 1901; but while it may be admitted that, if the proof established the identity of the animal in question with the animal which disappeared from plaintiff's hacienda in 19Q0, the discovery of the animal in Pangangban's possession early in 1901 might be sufficient to give ground for a suspicion as to his guilt, it would be wholly insufficient to sustain a finding of his guilt until and unless he had an opportunity to explain how he came into possession of the animal, and to prove, if he could, that he was guiltless of any crime in acquiring such possession.\u00a0 So far as the record in this case discloses, Pangangban never had any such opportunity extended to him, and there is no ground, therefore, upon which to base a finding that he had any part in the alleged theft of the <i>caraballa<\/i>; and, in any event, proof that Pangangban had stolen the animal, would not, in itself be sufficient to sustain a finding that one who bought from him, for a valuable consideration, nearly two years after the first date at which it appears he was in possession, was also a thief or had any part in\u00a0 the commission of the crime.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of record, which discloses that plaintiff's animal was lost in 1910, and that defendant and his predecessors in interest had been in uninterrupted possession of the animal in question more than six years prior to the date when this action was instituted, would appear to be sufficient to sustain a finding that defendant had acquired title thereto by prescription, under the provisions of article 1955 of the Civil Code, which declare that title by prescription may be acquired in personal property, by virtue of the uninterrupted possession for six years, <i>without the necessity of any other condition<\/i>; and to sustain a further finding that plaintiff's action to recover possession had prescribed, before the institution of this action, by virtue of the provisions of article 1962 of the Civil Code, as well as by the provisions of subsection 3 of section 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 But defendant being entitled to judgment in his favor under the provisions of article 1955 hereinbefore discussed and on which he relied, there is no need for a specific ruling on these possible defenses.<br\/><br\/>We do not deem it necessary to discuss at length the ruling of the trial court and the contention of counsel, that the provisions of the Civil Code and of the Code of Civil Procedure, thus construed and made applicable to the facts in this case, are in conflict with the provisions of section 5 of the Philippine Bill, which forbid the enactment of any law in\u00a0 these Islands \"which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, or deny to any person therein the equal protection of the laws.\"<br\/><br\/>Prescriptive rights have been recognized and protected by the laws of all nations, and indeed, in the language of Burke, the \"solid rock of prescription\" is \"the soundest, the most general, the most recognized title between man and man that is known in municipal, as in public jurisprudence.\"\u00a0 (Vol. IX, p. 449.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the trial court is reversed without costs in this instance, and twenty days from the date of this decision let judgment, be entered in accordance herewith, and ten days thereafter let the record be returned to the trial court where judgment will be entered in favor of the defendant for the costs in first instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Casiano, before a pastor or Protestant minister in the city of Manila, according to a certificate issued by the justice of the peace of this city on June 19, 1908, appearing at folio 9.<br\/><br\/>From the time they were married Platon Iba\u00f1ez and his wife, Maria Lopez, lived together for nearly five years and had two children, one of whom died, while the other is still living and is now nearly 12 years old.\u00a0 When the woman separated from her husband on account of the ill-treatment which, according to her statement, she received at his hands after the birth of her second child, she\u00a0 went to live with her parents in the said pueblo of Hagonoy, while the husband removed to Bulacan, arid later on to Manila, where he has resided ever since; but from the time of his second marriage, Platon Iba\u00f1ez and Vivencia B. Casiano have been living together.<br\/><br\/>In view of the above an assistant\u00a0 prosecuting attorney filed a complaint on the 25th of July, 1908, against the said Iba\u00f1ez, charging him with the crime of contracting an illegal marriage on the 9th of January, 1907, while his wife, Maria Lopez, was still living, and without his first marriage having been lawfully dissolved.\u00a0 The corresponding proceedings having been instituted, the court below rendered judgment on the 1st of September, 1908, sentencing the accused to the penalty of eight years and six months of <i>presidio mayor<\/i>, and the payment of the costs of the proceedings, from which judgment the representative of the accused has appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>From the above facts it appears to have been fully proven that Platon Iba\u00f1ez has committed the crime of illegal marriage.\u00a0 Inasmuch as while his lawful wife, Maria Lopez, was still living in the pueblo of Hagonoy, Province of Bulacan, where she and the accused, Platon Iba\u00f1ez, resided together for nearly five years, between\" the time when they were, married in accordance with the ecclesiastical and civil laws on the 8th of May, 1893, and the time when the husband abandoned his wife and went to live first in Bulacan and subsequently in the city of Manila, where he again contracted marriage on the 9th of January, 1907, with Vivencia B. Casiano before a Proteptanf; minister, without using due and necessary diligence in order to ascertain with certainty whether his lawful wife, Maria Lopez, was still living or was dead, as he claims in his defense, it is not proper to consider that he acted in good faith when marrying a second time.<br\/><br\/>Article 471 of the Penal Code provides as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Any person who shall contract a second or subsequent marriage without the prior marriage being lawfully dissolved shall be punished with the penalty of <i>prision mayor<\/i>.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>The impediment termed \"<i>ligamen<\/i>\" in law prohibits a married man or woman from contracting another bond of union as long as the\u00a0 consort is alive; a violation of the prohibitive law against contracting a second or subsequent marriage without the prior one being dissolved constitutes the crime of bigamy, which consists in the contracting, on the part of a married person with fraudulent intent and bad faith, of a new marriage while a lawful spouse is<br\/>living.<br\/><br\/>The two certificates exhibited, marked \"A\" and \"B,\" are authentic and indisputable; they prove the respective and successive celebrations of the two marriages contracted by the accused with two different women.\u00a0 Certificate marked \"B\" of the marriage contracted with Vivencia B. Casiano appears as having been issued by the justice of the peace of this city in connection with the register of marriage certificates kept in said court; and document marked \"A\" consists of a certificate of the record of the marriage copied from the church records kept in the parish church of the pueblo of Hagonoy and signed by the curate thereof.<br\/><br\/>It is proper to state herein that parish priests continue to be the legal custodians of the parish records kept under the laws enforced during the former sovereignty, and are authorized to issue true copies, in the form of certificates, of the entries contained in said books.\u00a0 The latter, for the purpose of proving th'e acts to which they refer, have not lost the character of public documents which they possessed under the former laws.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Arceo, 11 Phil. Rep., 530.)<br\/><br\/>The accused pleaded not guilty, but notwithstanding his exculpatory allegations unsupported by even circumstantial evidence, the record in the case furnishes incriminating data and sufficient merits to fully establish the conviction of his guilt as the proven responsible author of said crime, as it has not been\u00a0 shown that he contracted the second marriage in good faith.\u00a0 This case does not refer to a spouse who was absent for many years, but to a wife whom, on the statement of a third party, the accused believed to be already dead.\u00a0 In order to be sure he should have communicated with the relatives of the woman reported dead, and the parish priest and municipal secretary, who keep a record of the burials that take place in the pueblo, but as these things were not done, his allegation of good faith can\u00a0 not be accepted.<br\/><br\/>If it were true that the accused tried to ascertain the whereabouts of his wife, Maria Lopez, in the pueblo of Hagonoy where she now\u00a0 resides, well known and reputed among its inhabitants as an honest woman, according to the declaration of the parish priest thereof, it is impossible to believe, in the natural order of things, that, had he employed the most common and ordinary diligence, he could have remained ignorant of her whereabouts as well as that of his child; he did not do this, and preferred to incur the penalty that the penal law imposes on persons guilty of the crime of bigamy.<br\/><br\/>It has further been shown from the statements of his condition as given in his cedulas\u00a0 for 1905 and 1906 that Platon Iba\u00f1ez's second marriage was a guilty one and that he was aware that his lawful wife was still living; in the first one he appears as a widower, while in the second he appears as single.\u00a0 (Exhibits 1 and 2.)\u00a0 Such changes indicate bad faith on the part of the holder of said cedulas, as it is impossible to admit the explanation given by the accused, attributing the error to the clerk who made out the said document.\u00a0 It is impossible to understand how, if in his 1905 cedula he figured as a widower, he could appear as single in his cedula of 1906, unless it was done at his request or upon his indication, and, as there is no evidence to the contrary, it must be accepted as true that in 1905 he procured a widower's cedula but in the following year had himself appear as a bachelor, for had he given no instructions, his cedula for 1906 would have contained the same statement as that of the previous year.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, there is no question but that, under the provisions of General Orders, No. 68, the second marriage contracted by the accused was illegal and null.\u00a0 The first marriage contracted in 1893 had not been dissolved or annulled, inasmuch as his first wife was then, and is still living, and the accused did not come within the exception expressly indicated in the said general orders by the positive absence of his lawful wife, Maria Lopez.<br\/><br\/>In view of the above, and inasmuch as no mitigating nor aggravating circumstance is present in the commission of the crime, and in the absence of proof as to the amount or importance of the damages occasioned to the woman who married in good faith, and considering that the judgment appealed from is in accordance with the law and the merits of the case, it is our opinion that the same should be and is hereby affirmed; provided, however, that the penalty imposed shall be <i>prision mayor<\/i> with costs; and provided further, that the right to claim an indemnity in accordance with the provisions of article 480 of the code shall be reserved to the woman Vivencia B.

Article 503 of the Penal Code, subdivision 1, provides that the penalty for the crime of robbery shall be <i>cadena perpetua<\/i> to death, \"if on account or on the occasion of the robbery there results homicide.\"\u00a0 The maximum penalty, death, can not be imposed in the absence, of an aggravating circumstance.\u00a0 (Penal Code, art. 81.)\u00a0 A <i>garita<\/i> is not a dwelling within the meaning of article 10, subdivision 20, of the Penal Code.\u00a0 There is no evidence that the place where the crime was committed was uninhabited.\u00a0 As to nocturnity, article 10, subdivision 15, of said code says:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"When it is committed at night or in an uninhabited place, or by a gang.<br\/><br\/>\"The\u00a0 courts shall take this circumstance into consideration according to the nature and characteristics of the crime.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>We are of opinion that, under all the circumstances of this case, as disclosed by a careful reading of the evidence and record, the court is not warranted in finding any aggravating circumstance present in the commission of the crime.\u00a0 Estrada and his wife were traveling from one part of the country to another.\u00a0 Shortly before the commission of the crime they had taken possession of this <i>garita<\/i> for the night.\u00a0 The defendants, so far as the evidence goes, did not know, until almost the very moment of the crime, that Estrada was anywhere in that neighborhood.\u00a0 They happened to be passing that place and, seeing the <i>garita<\/i> and its occupants, conceived then the purpose of committing the crime for which they stand convicted.<br\/><br\/>The appreciation of nocturnity as an aggravating circumstance being in the discretion of the court (supreme court of Spain, February 28, 1884), we do not feel warranted in finding it present under the circumstances of this case.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court is, therefore, modified and the defendants are hereby sentenced to <i>cadena perpetua<\/i>, to the corresponding accessories provided in the law, to indemnify the family of the deceased in the sum of P500, and to pay each one-half of the costs of the action; and said judgment, so modified, is affirmed.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Rep., 230; Du-Yungco <i>vs.<\/i> Barrera, 5 Phil. Rep., 125; Cornelios <i>vs.<\/i> Guaranty Trust Co. (not reported), decided Nov. 27,1906; Reyes <i>vs.<\/i> Alburo, 7 Phil. Rep., 398; and Bartolome <i>vs.<\/i> Mandac, 8 Phil. Rep., 263.)<br\/><br\/>After the court refused to dismiss the appeal from the justice of the peace the plaintiff and appellee paid the clerk's fees and filed his complaint.\u00a0 To this complaint the defendant filed his answer, presenting many defenses, together with a general denial and the statute of prescription.\u00a0 After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause,' the lower court found that the plaintiff had no right to recover on said contract against the defendant, and dismissed the said cause, with costs against the plaintiff.\u00a0 From this judgment the plaintiff appealed, and in this court makes two assignments of error, each of which relates to the\u00a0 sufficiency of the proof to sustain plaintiff's demand.\u00a0 The plaintiff alleges that the proof was sufficient to show his right to recover upon said contract as against the defendant.\u00a0 During the trial in the Court of First Instance but four witnesses were examined-the plaintiff Jose Laserna Tupaz, his son Marcos Laserna, Macario Alegre, and the defendant.\u00a0 Jose Laserna Tupaz testified that the father of the defendant, Fausto Lozada, had executed and delivered the original contract and had made or signed the indorsement thereon upon the 22d day of July, 1890; that Fausto Lozada had made no payments upon said contract during his lifetime; that the defendant had paid 40 pesos upon said original contract.\u00a0 Marcos Laserna testified that he had made at least three demands upon the defendant for the payment of said contract; that the defendant had paid a part of said original indebtedness and promised to pay the balance.\u00a0 Rafael Lozada, the defendant, testified that the son of the plaintiff had made three demands upon him for the payment of said contract; that he had paid on said contract the sum of 60 pesos; that he had paid the said sum of 60 pesos in order to avoid a lawsuit; that he never promised to pay the amount of said obligation.<br\/><br\/>There was no proof whatever that the father of the defendant at the time of his death left any assets whatever, nor that the defendant had inherited any property from his father.\u00a0 The defendant contends that he never made any promise obligating\u00a0 himself to pay the said contract.\u00a0 On or about the 26th day of February, 1903, the plaintiff herein wrote a letter to the defendant (the letter does not appear in evidence) requesting the defendant to execute and deliver to him a contract for the payment of said indebtedness existing between his father (Fausto Lozada) and himself.\u00a0 The defendant herein, on the 27th day of February, 1903, answered said letter, which appears above and is marked \"Exhibit B.\"\u00a0 The plaintiff introduced in evidence this Exhibit B. The plaintiff claims that this letter (Exhibit B) was an acknowledgment of said contract and a promise to pay the same.\u00a0 A careful reading of this letter, however, clearly shows the contrary.\u00a0 The defendant expressly renounces any intention to pay the same and denies that the same is any obligation against him, and alleges that the payments which he had made upon the same were purely voluntary payments and were not made with any idea that he was responsible upon said contract.<br\/><br\/>The defendant admits that he paid to the plaintiff on different occasions the sum of 60 pesos but that the payments were not made upon the theory that he regarded himself responsible in any way for the payment of the indebtedness which his father owed to the plaintiff.\u00a0 He asserts that the payments were made in order to avoid the embarrassment of a lawsuit upon said contract which the plaintiff threatened to bring against him.\u00a0 The defendant denies that he ever made any promise whatever or that he had obligated himself in any manner for the payment of said contract.\u00a0 The mere payment of a part of said contract or debt, under the circumstances of this case, can not be regarded as a promise to pay said debt.\u00a0 The record does not show that the defendant had inherited any property from his father.\u00a0 He could not be liable, therefore, upon the theory that he had taken possession of property of his ancestor, thereby impliedly promising to pay his ancestor's debt.\u00a0 Therefore he can not be held liable upon the contract in question unless he had by some valid new contract, entered into by himself upon a sufficient consideration,\u00a0 promised\u00a0 or obligated himself to pay the\u00a0 said indebtedness.\u00a0 In our opinion the evidence does not show that such a contract was entered into by the defendant and he is, therefore, not liable to pay the said indebtedness.\u00a0 Upon the foregoing considerations, and without discussing the; other questions presented, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

There is  nothing in section 125 of Act No. 1189 which invalidates a bond because of its failure to show on its face that at the time of its execution the sureties presented their certificates of registration to any official or had in their possession such certificates.  It is true that that section provides that any person who transacts any business with any public offices or officers shall present his certificate of registration when he transacts such business, and doubtless the justice of the peace might and should have required the sureties to produce their certificates of registration when they executed the bond; but there is no requirement that a note of such fact should be entered on the bond nor does the law provide that the lack of such a note invalidates the bond.  The law provides that when any contract, deed, or other document is acknowledged before a notary, that official shall certify in a note on the face thereof that the parties thereto have presented to him their certificates of registration, and it expressly provides also that the lack of a note to this effect shall invalidate the notarial act.  But this provision applies to no other public official, and as the intervention of a notary was wholly unnecessary in the execution of the bond in question, it was not incumbent upon the sureties to have the fact that they presented certificates of registration certified on the face of the bond, and, of course, the lack of such certification in no wise invalidates the bond.<br\/><br\/>The defect in the bond arising from its failure to provide for the payment of rents and damages as well as costs presents a more serious question.  We have frequently held that the legislature, under its general authority to regulate appellate procedure, may require appeal bonds of the appellant in both civil and criminal cases, and in our decisions we have on many occasions recognized and accepted the general principle that acts required by statute to perfect an appeal are jurisdictional, and must be complied with to vest the appellate court with power to entertain the appeal.  Manifestly, therefore, neither the appellate nor the trial court, over the objection of appellee, can dispense with the statutory security or accept a security of a different character from that named in the statute, and it follows, as of course, that where no bond is given, the appeal must, upon motion of the appellee, be dismissed or stricken from the docket, unless it appears that the requirement has been waived by the appellee, as a technical step in appellate procedure purely for the appellee's benefit.<br\/><br\/>So also when an instrument purporting to be an appeal bond is so fatally defective as to be absolutely void or is not such an instrument as is contemplated by the statute, the appellate court acquires no jurisdiction.  (Macondray &amp; Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Quintero et al., 6 Phil. Rep., 429.)<br\/><br\/>But an appeal bond or undertaking is sufficient where it substantially complies with the statute, although it varies from its language, provided its legal effect is to secure to the appellee all the rights contemplated by the statute requiring the bond.  (Mejia <i>vs.<\/i> Alimorong, 4 Phil. Rep., 572.)<br\/><br\/>Between these extremes, however, a great variety of cases may arise and in actual practice do arise, wherein appeal bonds or undertakings, while they can not be said to be absolute nullities, are nevertheless so defective in form or substance that they fail to secure to the appellee <i>all<\/i> the rights contemplated by the statute requiring the bond or undertaking, and, therefore, entitle him to a dismissal of the appeal unless a proper amendment is made.  In such cases the question presents itself whether the defective bond or undertaking may not be sufficient to sustain the jurisdiction of the appellate court, at least for the purpose of permitting an amendment of the defective bond or the filing of a new bond, although it is admittedly insufficient without amendment to confer complete jurisdiction, when the appellee insists on his right to have the benefit of the bond or undertaking prescribed by the statute.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Johnson <i>vs.<\/i> Johnson (31  Ohio St., 131, 135) it was held that notwithstanding the fact that an appeal bond \"omitted some of the conditions required by the section regulating the appeal,\" the \"undertaking was too substantial, in both form and substance, to be treated as a nullity, and it should not have been so treated, unless the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas in appeals from the probate court, for the purpose of amendment, does not attach until an undertaking is filed, containing all the conditions prescribed by the section giving the appeal.  A rule so strict would tend to defeat, rather than promote the administering of justice in our courts.\"<br\/><br\/>In Coulter <i>vs.<\/i> Stark (7 Cal., 244), following Howard <i>vs.<\/i> Harman (5 Cal., 78), the court said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"But had the undertaking been defective, objection should have been made in the county court upon the appeal, when upon a proper showing, the party might have been permitted to file a proper undertaking.  When the appeal is taken <i>bona fide<\/i>, and not for delay, the appellate court will always permit another undertaking to be filed.  This is no injury to the respondent.  In proceedings before justices of the peace, there can not reasonably be required the same strictness as in the higher courts.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>In the case of Deen <i>vs.<\/i> Hemphill (7 Fed. Cases, 350) the court said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"It is admitted that the decision of the circuit court upon the first question (permitting a new bond to be filed after having sustained a motion to quash the old one) is contrary to the practice which has heretofore generally prevailed in this territory.  It is, however, sanctioned  by the practice of several of the States, * * *  and seems to be founded on reason.  (Brown <i>vs.<\/i> Matthews, 1 Rand (Va.), 462; 1 Munf. (Va.), 397.)  The object in requiring a bond from the party appealing is to secure the rights of the adverse party; and it seems to us, if the bond be given at any time before the suit is finally  acted upon by the circuit court, the rights of the parties are as effectually protected as if the bond taken by the justice had been valid and sufficient.  The fact that the justice failed to take a good bond should not operate to the prejudice of the party.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>(See also Foster <i>vs.<\/i> Foster, 7 Paige (N. Y.), 48.)<br\/><br\/>Our statute prescribing the conditions upon which an appeal from a judgment of a justice of the peace may be perfected would appear to be so positive and express in its terms as to forbid our holding that the Court of First Instance can acquire jurisdiction where no security is given or where the instrument purporting to be an appeal bond is a nullity and absolutely void (Macondray &amp; Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Quintero et al., 6 Phil. Rep., 429); but  we think that under the liberal rules of procedure and amendment laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure we can and should hold that when in good faith, and not for the mere purpose of delay, a bond, undertaking, or other instrument which (while it may fall far short of securing all the rights contemplated by the statute requiring the bond, and is defective in either form or substance) secures to the appellee at least a partial protection of his rights, such bond, undertaking, or other instrument, when approved by the justice of the peace is sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the Court of First Instance, at least for the purpose of amendment; and that in such cases the appellant should be allowed, upon reasonable terms, to perfect the bond wherein it is defective, or to file a new bond such as is required under the statute providing for the allowance of appeals.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for applicants in their brief point out other alleged irregularities in the proceedings whereby the action was transferred from the court of the justice of the peace to the Court of First Instance, especially the alleged failure of the appellants to deposit with the court the amount of damages allowed in the court of the justice of the peace, as required by the statute; but since the petition does not expressly allege the failure of appellants so to do, this question is not properly before us in ruling upon the demurrer to the complaint.  We may say, however, that in the event that appellants in the proceedings below did in fact omit to make the deposit as is intimated by counsel in his brief, we see no reason why the omission should not be corrected in the same manner as the defect in the bond may be corrected on the motion of the appellee, by an order dismissing the appeal unless the deposit be made within a fixed number of days; and in the absence of such a motion the irregularity in the proceedings must be taken to have been waived by the appellees, for whose benefit alone the<br\/>provision requiring the deposit was made.<br\/><br\/>The several demurrers of the various defendants are sustained, and plaintiffs will be given a period of five  days from the date of the  notice of this decision in which to amend their complaint.  If an amended complaint is not filed within  that time, the clerk, without  further orders from this court, will  enter final judgment in this case in favor of the defendants, denying the issuance of the, writ<br\/>prayed for, with costs against the plaintiffs.  So ordered.<br\/><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<i><\/i><br\/><\/div>",

whereupon Lao Lock Hing ordered it thrown overboard, which was done, and in order to conciliate the guards offered each of them Pl,000 not to report the matter to their chief.<br\/><br\/>Some hours later, by order of the authorities, two divers, Florentino Rodriguez and Tiburcio Cabugason, recovered the package.\u00a0 It proved\u00a0 to be a closed bag containing seventy tins of opium of which nine tins were damaged and the contents spilled.\u00a0 Two tins were sent to a pharmacist for chemical analysis who stated that he found their contents, which he examined and analyzed, to consist of opium alkaloids, destined among other uses for that of smoking.\u00a0 This seized opium constitutes the <i>corpus delicti<\/i> and is offered in evidence as Exhibit A.<br\/><br\/>In view of the above, a complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal on the'20th day of the said month with the Court of First Instance of Cebu, charging Lao Lock Hing with the violation of section 31 of Act No.\u00a0 1761, in that he had been in possession, had charge of, and had had under his control seventy tins of opium without being duly authorized.\u00a0 Corresponding proceedings were instituted, and the trial judge after hearing the evidence adduced, rendered judgment on the 14th of December of the same year, sentencing the accused to the penalty of five years' imprisonment, to pay a fine of P10,000, and in case of insolvency to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, not to exceed one year, and to pay the costs, the fifty-nine tins of opium contained in the bag, Exhibit A, the nine damaged tins, and the two that were sent for analysis to be turned over to the collector of customs of Cebu for confiscation; from which judgment the accused has appealed.<br\/><br\/>It is seen from the facts stated above that the accused purser of the said steamer had in his possession and control seventy tins of opium which were concealed in a bag in one of the holds of said steamer, and that he tried to land the same at a time when the vessel was lying at anchor in Cebu; when he found that the customs guards doing duty on said steamer were disposed to perform their duties, even though he had tried to bribe them, he ordered one of his Chinese subordinates to throw the package overboard, which was done, but a few hours later and by means of two divers the package which contained said seventy tins of opium was recovered.<br\/><br\/>Section 31 of Act No. 1761, passed on the 10th of October, 1907, reads as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Any unauthorized person owning, carrying, holding, having, controlling, having possession of, or knowingly having on his premises, any opium, cocaine, alpha or beta cocaine, or any derivative or preparation of such drugs or substances, on and after March first, nineteen hundred and eight, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding ten thousand pesos, or by imprisonment for not exceeding five years, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court:\u00a0 <i>Provided, however<\/i>, That in the case of the commission of a second offense under the provisions of this section, any person so convicted, if other than a citizen of the United States or a citizen of the Philippine Islands, may, by order of the court, be deported.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>It is a proven fact that the accused, Lao Lock Hing, held, was in possession of, and had control of the seventy tins of opium which were in the sack on board the steamer <i>Kaifong<\/i> from the night of November 1, 1908, until the following morning, while at anchor in the port of Cebu, since the evidence adduced at the trial shows beyond all reasonable\u00a0 doubt that the accused shipped on the said steamer the seventy tins of opium which were seized, and took them to the port of Cebu, there to be smuggled ashore and\u00a0 landed; he knew that it was an article the introduction of which into this country is prohibited by law and punished by a heavy penalty.\u00a0 Yet he did not hesitate to circumvent the law and violate its provisions, and even dared to commit another crime by attempting to bribe the agents of the authorities who might have surprised him in his criminal act and seized the contraband article which he brought with him and was trying to get ashore.<br\/><br\/>The accused pleaded not guilty, and his counsel in this second instance has alleged:\u00a0 (1) That the court below erred in overruling his demurrer to the complaint for the reason that the said complaint was not drawn in accordance with the law and for the further reason that the acts complained of did not constitute a crime; (2) that the court below also erred in finding that the accused was guilty of violating section 31 of Act No. 1761, and for having sentenced him to the maximum penalty.<br\/><br\/>In spite of the fact that counsel for the accused did not except to the overruling of the demurrer, it should be noted that the complaint upon which the proceedings were instituted appears to be drawn in accordance with the provisions of section 6 of General Orders, No. 58, inasmuch as Lao Lock Hing is charged with the violation of the provisions of section 31 of Act No. 1761, in having maliciously and illegally performed certain acts set forth in the said complaint which he well knew were forbidden by the said Act; with criminal intent to violate its prohibition, secretly and unlawfully, and by offering a bribe to the Government agents placed as watchmen on the steamer, he endeavored to carry and smuggle ashore the forbidden contraband article.<br\/><br\/>The crime under consideration consists of the violation of a special law as referred to in article 7 of the Penal Code, and consequently the provisions of said code and the classifications of the crimes comprised therein are not applicable in the present case.\u00a0 The said crime must be punished under the provisions of the Act which the sovereign power, by virtue of its authority, saw fit to enact for the good of the country and of its inhabitants.\u00a0 Wherefore, inasmuch as it is an act which the lawmaker has declared to be invested with the attributes of a crime, the overruling of the demurrer and the prosecution of the case are in\u00a0 accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>As to the culpability of the accused as the responsible author of the said crime, the testimony in the case and the circumstantial evidence, together with the seizure, of the opium thrown into the sea show conclusively that the accused, Lao Lock Hing, if not the owner, was at least in charge of and responsible for a large and valuable amount of opium on board the <i>Kaifong<\/i>, since by reason of his office and position on board said ship it was an easy matter for him to carry concealed thereon the package containing the seventy tins of opium.\u00a0 Indeed so great was his anxiety to get it ashore, notwithstanding the strict prohibition of the law of which he was aware, that he offered P200 to each of the two watchmen to permit him to land it at the port of Cebu; and to this end two Chinamen, Ah Ki and Ah Yu, members of the ship's crew, took the package from the hold by\u00a0 order of the accused and placed it forward on deck on the port side near the rail, but between 1 and 2 o'clock on the following morning, fearing that the package of opium\u00a0 might be seized, the accused called up another Chinaman, Ah Chiong, and ordered him to throw said package overboard, which he did, and, the guards' attention being attracted by the splash, the accused approached them and offered each one of them P1,000 if they would not report it to their American chief.<br\/><br\/>The conduct of the accused in respect to the package of opium in question shows that he had the greatest interest in keeping it and\u00a0 in accomplishing the safe landing of the same, and upon seeing that he could not consummate his unlawful design, notwithstanding his offer of a bribe to the customs guards, he resorted to the extreme of concealing it in the sea, believing in his desperate position that he would thus prevent its seizure.\u00a0 He has not claimed that the opium belonged to a third party, and all the above facts show that, if not the owner of the drug, he was at least the possessor, conductor, and bearer of the article, and therefore, directly responsible under the law, together with such other persons as may subsequently appear, for the violation of the same.<br\/><br\/>For the above reasons it is our opinion that the court, using the discretion authorized by law in imposing an adequate penalty, should affirm the judgment appealed from, provided, however, that the accused, Lao Lock Hing, shall only be sentenced to two years' imprisonment, to pay a fine of P3,000, with the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1732, without, however, exceeding one year, and to pay the costs of this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

No. 5165, September 15, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>GERVASIO UNSON, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, <i>VS.<\/i> SEGUNDO ABRERA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 25th of February, 1908, Gervasio Unson filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance of Tayabas setting forth that in the year 1897 he and Abrera formed a partnership for the purchase and sale of copra, Unson being the capitalist, and Abrera an industrial partner; that Unson engaged to furnish Abrera all the capital necessary to start the business on condition that Unson should receive two-thirds of the profits; that notwithstanding the fact that the business was a prosperous one and continued until 1899, it had to suspend operations on account of the war, although the partnership has not been dissolved up to the present day; that\u00a0 when the business ceased the plaintiff recovered the cashbook from the defendant, who kept the company's books, and the following entries appeared there-in under date of the 23d of December, 1898, to wit:\u00a0 debit P52,562.09; credit P48,135.97; balance on hand P4,426.12, in which were included bills receivable amounting to P2,884.63; it also appeared that up to January, 1899, Abrera had received from Unson merchandise to the value of P1,133.82, it having been agreed between them that no credit should be given to anyone except for account and under the guarantee of the defendant; that ever since that date the plaintiff has repeatedly, but thus far unsuccessfully, requested the defendant to liquidate the accounts in order to bring the partnership to a close; that the amounts stated above were advanced by the plaintiff as capital for the business, and are now in the possession of the defendant, who refuses to deliver the same to the plaintiff to whom said sums belong; the plaintiff therefore prayed the court to enter judgment against the defendant in the sum of P4,559.94, that being the capital of the business advanced by the plaintiff and now in the hands of the defendant, together with interest at the rate of 6 per cent and costs.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer presented by the defendant to the foregoing complaint, maintaining that the facts alleged in said complaint did not constitute a right of action, was overruled on the 28th of\u00a0 April, 1908, to which the defendant excepted.<br\/><br\/>On the 20th of May of the same year the plaintiff moved that the court declare the defendant in default, and fix a day whereon the plaintiff might produce evidence showing that the defendant had appeared for the hearing of the case on the 10th of April and demurred to the complaint on the 15th of said month, which demurrer was overruled on the 28th of said month, the defendant excepting; and although the court below had ordered the defendant to answer the complaint within the term fixed by the rules, he had not done so in spite of the fact that more than twelve days had elapsed.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, informed of the foregoing motion, in a writing dated May 25, answered:\u00a0 that the defendant's counsel had not been notified by the plaintiff of the over-ruling of the demurrer by the court, and that the term of five days granted to the defendant in which to answer the complaint, when a demurrer thereto is overruled, should count from the day after the day of the notification by the plaintiff of the order or ruling wherein said demurrer is set aside, as provided by section 9 of the Rules of the Courts of First Instance; therefore, he moved that the request of the plaintiff in his previous writing be denied.<br\/><br\/>The matter having been set for hearing on the 5th of September, the defendant in a writing dated August 21, 1908, answering the complaint, stated:\u00a0 that the allegations contained in paragraph 1 of the complaint are true with the exception of the\u00a0 part which, according to the agreement between the partners, refers to the proportion of the net profits of the business that should accrue to the defendant; that the allegations contained in paragraph 2 of the complaint are also true, but not so those set forth in paragraphs 3, 4, and 5, which the defendant denies.\u00a0 As a special defense he alleged that whatever action the plaintiff may have had against the defendant by reason of the said partnership had expired by limitation; that the said commercial partnership had been satisfactorily liquidated between the parties thereto in January 1899, and that it was agreed between the plaintiff and the\u00a0 defendant that the latter should receive two-thirds of the net profits of the business, and for said reason he asked that judgment be entered in his favor absolving him of the complaint, and sentencing the plaintiff to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>The question involved in this litigation is the recovery of the balance of certain accounts that existed between the parties by reason of a partnership which they had formed for the purchase and sale of copra.<br\/><br\/>In no document does there appear the contract of partnership, from\u00a0 which arose said accounts and balance, and aside from the book kept by the defendant and which was offered in evidence by the plaintiff, together with the testimony of the latter, the record fails to disclose sufficient evidence to permit of a decision allowing the plaintiff's claim.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the fact that the items appearing in paragraph 3 of the complaint agree with the entries in said book, with the exception of the last one which must be a mistake and should read 133.82 instead of 1,133.82, as appears therein, nevertheless, as the defendant denies the plaintiff's contention that it had been agreed between them that no credits should be allowed to anyone except for account of and under the guaranty of the said defendant, the record fails to establish the plaintiff's claim inasmuch as the contract of partnership does not appear in writing, and the book offered in evidence originated with the defendant, nor has the plaintiff produced the books that he ought to have kept showing the transactions which must have taken place here in Manila, in connection with said business.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that the credits amount to P2,884.63, and the value of the stock on hand, according to the complaint and the aforesaid book, amounts to only P1,541.49, and that as long as there appears no proper liquidation of the partnership accounts, all cash, stock on hand, and bills receivable belong to the partnership without prejudice to such responsibility as, from the evidence, one partner might be shown to have contracted in favor of the other.<br\/><br\/>In consequence of the foregoing, and by virtue of the provisions of section 496 of the Code of Civil Procedure, we believe that a new trial should be held and such evidence submitted as would, at the proper time, enable final judgment to be entered, based on the testimony and evidence presented by the litigants herein.<br\/><br\/>As to the last part of section 9 of the Rules of the Courts of First Instance, it should be remembered that the sole object of the provisions of the rule is the notification of the defendant in order that he may answer the complaint within five days, and once notified and informed that his demurrer has been overruled, the term fixed by the law commences, and the\u00a0 defendant is obliged to comply with the further provisions thereof.<br\/><br\/>Even admitting the argument erroneously advanced by the defendant, though it was based on the literal wording of said section 9 of the Rules, section 110 in connection with section 2 of the Code of Procedure authorizes the trial judge in his discretion, to permit an answer or other writing to be presented even after the time fixed for its presentation by the general rules; and in view of the fact that a written answer to the complaint was filed in the first instance, and that the defendant excepted and submitted a bill of exceptions to the judgment appealed from, and in addition thereto presented a brief in this second instance, it is left to the discretion of the lower court to determine whether or not, upon a new trial being held, the defendant may appear therein to the end that justice may be done.<br\/><br\/>In view of the considerations above set forth the judgment appealed from is hereby set aside\", and the case will be remanded to the court whence it came with a certified copy of this decision in order that a new trial may be held in accordance with the law and the terms indicated above, and that in due course such judgment be rendered as it may consider proper in view of the evidence already adduced, and of such additional evidence as may be forthcoming at the new trial.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

THE EASTERN MINING COMPANY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant for the purpose of recovering the sum of $2,705, United States currency, with interest.\u00a0 The action was based upon two grounds:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 For services rendered by the plaintiff for the defendant as engineer and general agent of the defendant, at a salary of $250, United States currency, per month, from on or about the 15th of October, 1906, until the 15th of April, 1907.\u00a0 The plaintiff alleged that there was still due and unpaid upon said contract of employment the sum of $125, United States currency.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 And for a second cause of action the plaintiff alleged that he had been employed by the defendant on the 1st day of May, 1907, to visit the United States in the interests of the said defendant, and that the defendant promised to pay to him as salary the sum of $250, United States currency, per month, and the necessary expenses of his voyage, including his food; that in accordance with such employment, on the 1st day of May, 1907, the plaintiff left the Philippine Islands and went to the United States under said contract of employment, and returned to the Philippine Islands on or about the 15th of October, 1907, and that his employment under this agreement with the defendant was terminated on the 25th of October, 1907; that there was still due under said contract for salary and necessary expenses incurred, the sum of $2,580 United States currency.<br\/><br\/>To this complaint the defendant demurred, which demurrer was overruled.\u00a0 Later the defendant answered and presented a general denial of each and all of the facts alleged by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Later the cause was duly tried, and after hearing the evidence the\u00a0 lower court found that there was due to the plaintiff from the defendant the sum of P5,310, for which sum he rendered a judgment against the defendant and in favor of the plaintiff, with interest at 6 per cent per annum from the 21st of February, 1908, with costs.<br\/><br\/>From this decision the defendant appealed and in this court made the following assignments of errors:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"First. That the findings of fact in the judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance are not supported by the preponderance of the evidence in the case.<br\/><br\/>\"Second. That the findings of fact in the judgment rendered by the said Court of First Instance are clearly and manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence in the said case.<br\/><br\/>\"Third. That the judgment rendered in this case is contrary to the preponderance of the evidence adduced in the same.<br\/><br\/>\"Fourth. That the conclusions of the said court at the trial, regarding the admission of evidence in this case and the dismissal of the evidence offered at the said trial, were contrary to law.<br\/><br\/>\"Fifth. That the judgment of the said court, as rendered, is contrary to law.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The first three assignments of error above noted relate only to the question of the sufficiency of the evidence adduced during the trial to support the judgment of the lower court.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the first cause of action in which the plaintiff\u00a0 attempts to recover of the defendant the sum of $125 (P250) the defendant admits its responsibility for this amount.\u00a0 (Brief of appellant, p. 2.)<br\/><br\/>With reference to the second cause of action the plaintiff claims that the defendant owes him the sum of $1,500, United States currency, as salary due him for services rendered from the 1st day of May, 1907, up to and including the 31st day of October, 1907, at the rate of $250 per month; and in addition thereto the sum of $1,880, United States currency, for money expended for traveling expenses and living expenses in going to and from the United States, which expenses were incurred in accordance with the terms of the contract between the said plaintiff and defendant.\u00a0 The plaintiff admits that he received as payment on his claim the sum of $800, United States currency, leaving due him, according to his\u00a0 claim, the sum of $2,580, United States currency.\u00a0 In support of this claim the plaintiff introduced a letter written by him to the defendant, dated April (August), 1906, which letter was marked \"Exhibit B\" and is as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"My services as mining engineer to your company are at your disposal for $250 gold a month, and all expenses, including proper quarters, food, etc., traveling expenses where necessary, technical and personal services and assistance, etc., such as usually obtain.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>On the 29th day of April, 1907, the board of directors of the defendant passed the following resolution:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Whereas Mr. A. J. Eveland has signified his willingness to resume his position as general manager of said company:\u00a0 Therefore, be it<br\/><br\/>\"<i>Resolved<\/i>, That A. J. Eveland be, and hereby is, employed by The Eastern Mining Company as\u00a0 mining engineer and general manager of said company, according to the terms mentioned in the letter of the said A. J. Eveland, dated April (August) 24, 1906, and on file with the secretary of said company; said services to begin on the 1st day of May, 1907.<br\/><br\/>\"<i>Be it further resolved<\/i>, That the said A. J. Eveland be given, and he hereby is given, full and general powers of attorney to represent The Eastern Mining Company in any and all matters in the United States.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The resolution of the board above referred to contained other matters which, however, have no bearing upon the question of the employment of the plaintiff, with reference to his salary and expenses.<br\/><br\/>There seems to have been some question whether the letter (Exhibit B) bore the date of August, 1906, or April, 1906.\u00a0 It was admitted, however, by\u00a0 the defendant that the letter should bear the date of April, 1906, and therefore that date\u00a0 is used.\u00a0 The date is a matter of no importance, however, because it was written before the date of the said resolution (Exhibit A) and no question is made as to its contents.<br\/><br\/>It appears that the plaintiff, under the contract thus entered into by Exhibits A and B, entered upon the employment and sailed for the United States on or about the 1st day of May, 1907, and returned to Manila on or about the 15th day of October of the same year.\u00a0 Upon the return of the plaintiff from the United States he rendered an account of his salary and expenses to the board of directors and asked that the same be paid.\u00a0 So far as the record shows there was no objection made by the defendant at the time of the rendition of said account, except as to the amount of the expenses incurred by the plaintiff.\u00a0 The account of the plaintiff was referred to an auditing committee of the board of directors of the defendant company, which committee on the 25th of October, 1907, made the following report:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The undersigned committee begs to present the following report of their investigation of the report submitted by A. J. Eveland of his expenditures from Manila to New York and return while traveling for the Eastern Mining Company, that, with the exception of a few dollars spent as tips to servants, etc., <i>the said expenditures have been validly made<\/i>, but considering that Mr. Eveland was drawing a salary of $250 United States currency per month from the company, and his living expenses, and further considering that this company was and is in a struggling condition financially, it is respectfully recommended that the expense bill rendered by the said Mr. Eveland amounting to over $15 United States currency per day is excessive, and that the directors request him to exercise that spirit of fairness which we believe his, by reducing his account to a more reasonable basis, considering the condition of this company.<br\/><br\/>\"Respectfully,<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\"T. M. DEVILBLISS.<br\/>\"THOS. D. AITKEN.<br\/>\"G. W. PARSONS.\"<\/div><\/blockquote><br\/>From the above report of the committee appointed to audit the account of the plaintiff it will be seen that the said committee found \"that, with the exception of a few dollars spent as tips to servants, etc., the said expenditures have been validly made.\"<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff presented to the board Exhibit C, which was an itemized statement of his expenditures during his trip to the United States, and during the trial swore that this statement was true and correct and that the expenditures indicated in said itemized statement were made as stated in said account.\u00a0 The plaintiff was discharged as an employee of the defendant on the 25th of October, 1907.\u00a0 The period of his services, therefore, as claimed under his second cause of action, was from the 1st of May, 1907, to the 25th of October, 1907.<br\/><br\/>An effort was made on the part of the defendant during the trial of the cause to show that there was an understanding between the plaintiff and defendant that he was not to be paid until the company was in a position to do so comfortably.\u00a0 The lower court found as a fact and the president of the said company testified during the trial that it owed no debts, that it had no incumbrances, and that it\u00a0 owned property which he considered worth more than a half a million dollars.\u00a0 It would seem, therefore, that if the contention of the defendant in this particular should be admitted that even then it should not affect the right of the plaintiff to a judgment, considering the financial condition of the company as stated by the president.<br\/><br\/>Under the foregoing statements of facts, as sustained by the record, and with special reference to the second cause of action, it would seem that the following facts are admitted beyond question:<br\/><br\/>First. That the plaintiff was employed by the defendant as its mining engineer and general manager.<br\/><br\/>Second. That such employment commenced on May 1, 1907, and terminated October 25, 1907, covering a period of five months and twenty-five days.<br\/><br\/>Third. That the plaintiff was directed by the defendant to proceed jto the United States on business for the company, and that the plaintiff, in obedience to said direction, did go to the United States and returned October 15, 1907.<br\/><br\/>Fourth. That the defendant was to be paid the sum of $250, United States currency, per month, as said mining engineer and general manager, and his necessary expenses, including proper quarters, food, traveling expenses, technical and personal services and assistance, etc.\u00a0 (See Exhibits A, B, C, and D.)<br\/><br\/>Exhibits A and B above quoted constituted an absolute offer and an absolute\u00a0 acceptance and therefore together constitute a contract, in accordance with the terms of the said exhibits.\u00a0 There was an attempt during the trial of the cause to vary the terms of this contract, and while the court admitted much evidence which tended to vary the terms of\u00a0 the said contract, yet the court in its decision, in accordance with section 285 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, held that such evidence should not be allowed to have the effect of varying the terms of the said contract.<br\/><br\/>The defendant attempted to show that the services rendered by the plaintiff while he was in the United States were rather against than in favor of the interests of the defendant.\u00a0 The evidence is not clear upon this question.\u00a0 Even though it should be admitted, it would operate rather to show that the defendant had made a mistake in entering into the contract with this particular plaintiff than to invalidate the contract which it had made.<br\/><br\/>The defendant further contends that it received no benefit whatever from the services of the plaintiff while he was on his trip to the United States in the interest of the said company.\u00a0 That fact may be admitted, for the payment of the salary and expenses of the plaintiff mentioned in said contract were not dependable upon the result of his efforts in behalf of said company.\u00a0 The evidence admitted for the purpose of showing that the payment of the salary and expenses of the plaintiff depended upon whether or not the efforts of the plaintiff in the United States were successful was inadmissible under the contract.\u00a0 It would be extremely dangerous to permit testimony of this character to vary the terms of written contracts.\u00a0 There is nothing in the\u00a0 record which shows that at the time the offer\u00a0 and acceptance were made that the parties to the said offer and acceptance had the remotest idea that the payment of the salary and expenses mentioned in said contract depended upon the successful result of the efforts of the plaintiff while on his trip to the United States.<br\/><br\/>The attorney for the appellant has presented a very interesting and able brief in this court, but after a careful examination of all of the facts presented by him we are compelled to, and do hereby, find that the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause was sufficient to justify the findings of fact\u00a0 made by the lower court.<br\/><br\/>We deem it unnecessary to discuss the fourth and fifth assignments of error made by the appellant, for the reason that the questions involved in them have been discussed in relation to the other assignments of error.<br\/><br\/>We find no reason for changing or modifying the judgment of the lower court and the same is hereby affirmed with costs.<br\/><br\/>After the expiration of twenty days let judgment\u00a0 be entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the sum of P5,310, with interest at 6 per cent from the 21st of February, 1908.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that the defendant Compa\u00f1ia de Tabacos had asked and obtained from the Court of First Instance, in or about the month of October of the same year, the appointment of a receiver for the property of Romana Ganzon, among which property that described above was included at the instance of the\u00a0 defendant as belonging to the debtor Ganzon; that at the designation of the Compa\u00f1ia de Tabacos Juan Pomar was appointed receiver and upon taking charge of the property of the said Romana Ganzon he did not confine himself thereto, but unlawfully and without any right whatever took possession, as receiver, of the property of the plaintiff hereinbefore described; that notwithstanding the repeated demands made by the plaintiff, Bischoff, the latter was unable to secure from the defendants the return of the said property; that they refused to deliver the said property to him and continued to use the same to the prejudice of the plaintiff, whose loss and damages amounted to P30 a day; the plaintiff therefore prayed that judgment be entered in his favor, declaring that the property described in the first paragraph of the complaint belonged to him, and that the said defendants be ordered to pay the said losses and damages with costs.<br\/><br\/>In his written answer, counsel for the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos denied the allegations 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8 of the complaint, and as a defense alleged, that under a public instrument executed before the notary Gregorio Yulo, on the 20th of July, 1900, Lazaro Mota\u00a0 y Ayo loaned to Romana Ganzon or Tan son, widow of Vega, the sum of 11,209 pesos, payable at the expiration of two years from the date of the instrument, and as security for her debt, the said Romana Ganzon mortgaged to her creditor, Mota, the sugar plantation called Ban Jose, situated in the sitio of Sibungcogon, barrio of San Carlos, in the town of Calatrava, Occidental Negros; that by another instrument executed on October 8, 1900, Lazaro Mota and Romana Ganzon agreed to increase the said mortgage credit by a further sum of 4,177,20 pesos; that this was duly paid to the debtor, whose total indebtedness thus amounted to 15,386.20 pesos, the said mortgage remaining as security for both amounts; that by another instrument executed on September 6, 1902, before the same notary, the loan or debt was further increased by the sum of 6,037.73 pesos, which Mota delivered to Ganzon; this last amount, added to the previous 15,386.20 pesos, makes a total of 21,423.93 pesos, and it was agreed upon between the parties in this last instrument that, if Ganzon was not able to pay the creditor Mota on or before July 20, 1904, the mortgaged hacienda would be disposed of at public auction, together with its buildings, machinery and agricultural implements, and the whole amount of the indebtedness would be collected from the proceeds thereof; that this instrument was entered in the registry of property on October 11, 1902; that by an instrument dated September 30,1904, Lazaro Mota y Ayo unreservedly transferred the said credit, free of all incumbrance, together with all of his rights, to the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos for\u00a0 the sum of P21,423.93, subrogating to the latter all his rights with respect to the collection of the debt from Ganzon; that by another instrument dated December 10, 1904, Romana Ganzon created a mortgage in favor of the said company on the aforesaid Hacienda of San Jose for all the amounts owed, which amounts are, the said P21,423.93 transferred by Mota to the Compafa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos, and P31,195.99, plus P422.61 as interest at 10 per cent on Mota's credit, making a grand total of P53,042.53, said instrument being entered in the registry of property; that the aforesaid steam sugar mill and portable 8-horsepower boiler, the tramway, with all its fittings, appurtenances, and rails, and all the cars upon the above-mentioned Hacienda of San Jose, are fixtures thereon, and the machinery, vessels, implements, and utensils are necessary for the working of said hacienda and formed an integral part of the same when the said mortgages were executed; that the plaintiff Bischoff was informed and knew of said mortgages prior to making the alleged purchase of the goods mentioned in his complaint; that the property referred to in the complaint, together with the Hacienda of San Jose, was mortgaged to the creditor company as security for its loan of P53,042.53; that said mortgage still stands because neither Romana Ganzon nor the plaintiff have paid it; that the credit of the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos, secured by the said mortgages, is anterior and\u00a0 preferent to the purchase alleged by the\u00a0 plaintiff, and, therefore, the defendant prays that judgment be entered in his favor dismissing the complaint; that all the property claimed by the plaintiff as his own property, be held to be included in the mortgage in favor of the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos, and that the mortgage credit of the said Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos be declared as preferred.<br\/><br\/>The other defendant, Juan Pomar, in his answer denied the allegations contained in the complaint, and as a defense set forth that by virtue of an order of the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros, dated September 27, 1905, in the matter of The Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos <i>vs<\/i>. Romana Ganzon or Tanson, viuda de Vega, the deponent was appointed receiver of the property claimed in the complaint; that both the petitioner and the Compa\u00f1ia Tabacalera had executed the bonds required by law in the amounts of P12,000 and P6,000, respectively, which bonds were approved on the 31st of October of the same year; that after being duly sworn, he was appointed receiver, assumed the duties of his office, and took charge of the said property with no other interest than the faithful and exact compliance of the orders of the lower court in the performance of his duties; for this reason he prayed that the complaint be dismissed with costs.<br\/><br\/>At the trial of the case evidence was adduced by both parties and their exhibits were made of record.\u00a0 On February 28, 1907, the court below rendered judgment, holding that the steam sugar mill and 8-horsepower portable boiler and fittings, the tramway, rails and cars upon the Hacienda of San Jose, should be considered as included in the mortgage executed by Romana Ganzon in favor of Lazaro Mota, which mortgage was transferred to the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos and ratified in favor of the latter by the debtor; the defendants were therefore absolved of the complaint without costs, and such right of action was reserved to Samuel Bischoff as he may be entitled for the return from Romana Ganzon of whatever sum he paid for the said property.<br\/><br\/>From the above judgment the plaintiff appealed and moved that the same be set aside and a new trial granted; his motion was overruled, to which overruling he excepted and presented the corresponding bill of exceptions; the latter was approved by the court below and submitted to this court.<br\/><br\/>Supposing that the steam sugar mill and portable boiler, and the tramway with fifteen small wagons, rails, and other fittings, mounted at the Hacienda San Jose and in use thereon, were improvements upon said hacienda, are they to be considered for this sole reason as necessarily included in the mortgage of the said hacienda, even though not specifically described in the instruments as included therein?<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff avers, without proof, that the said articles were excluded from the mortgage of the Hacienda San Jose where they are to be found, because in the instruments wherein the Hacienda San Jose was repeatedly mortgaged, far from it being stated that, by agreement between the contracting parties, the objects claimed in the complaint should be understood to be positively excluded, in the successive mortgage deeds executed by Romana Ganzon in favor of Lazaro Mota y Ayo on July 20 and October 8, 1900, and September 6, 1902, Exhibit D, as security for the increasing loans made by the latter, the debtor mortgaged her Hacienda San Jose with the improvements thereon to guarantee the payment of the total sum of 21,423.93 pesos; in the last instrument, as well as in the previous ones, it is stated that the\u00a0 warehouse, farmhouse, furnaces, machinery, and the described land that constitutes the said hacienda shall be liable for the payment of her total indebtedness, the legal interest thereon, and loss and damages and\u00a0 costs in case of judicial proceedings having to be instituted; said instrument, like the previous ones, was recorded in the registry of property, and it should be noted that by express desire of the contracting parties, in the successive documents of indebtedness of 1900, the mortgage of the hacienda with the improvements thereon was maintained, and was afterwards repeated in the last instrument.<br\/><br\/>Owing to the nonpayment of the said sum of P21,423.93, notwithstanding the demands made upon, and extensions of time granted to the debtor, on September 30, 1904, the creditor, Lazaro Mota, assigned and transferred the said credit with all his rights to the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos by means of a\u00a0 public instrument which was recorded in the registry, and appears as Exhibit B herein.<br\/><br\/>In the private\u00a0 document marked as Exhibit A, dated September 10, 1902, it appears that the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos opened an annual credit of P15,000 under the conditions therein stated, the debtor having offered as security the said hacienda with the cattle, buildings, and two steam engines, and stating in addition, that the said hacienda with its buildings, machinery, and cattle had already been mortgaged by her to Lazaro Mota.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, even in the instrument executed on the 10th of December, 1904, when Romana Ganzon created a mortgaged in favor of\u00a0 the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos to guarantee her debt of P53,042.53, she designated the said hacienda with all the improvements, buildings, machinery, and carabaos thereon, and in addition declared that the same hacienda and its dependencies were already mortgaged to the said Lazaro Mota.<br\/><br\/>So that in the instruments of mortgage above referred to, three of which are anterior to the sale <i>a retro<\/i>, effected on the 8th of November, 1904, upon which the plaintiff bases his claim, the improvements on the Hacienda San Jose, among which is the machinery that was already mounted, appear as expressly mortgaged at the time of executing the instrument of mortgage of September 6,1902, and later on, that of transfer of the mortgage credit on the 30th of September, 1904, to the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos.<br\/><br\/>From none of the said instruments does it appear that the contracting parties had expressly agreed to exclude the said machinery and tramway from the repeated mortgages of said hacienda, so that no value would be given to the words written therein proving in an unquestionable manner that it was the will of the contracting parties to include in the lien all the improvements upon the hacienda, among which was the machinery mounted thereon for the needs of the said hacienda:<br\/><br\/>Article 110 of the Mortgage Law in force reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"A mortgage extends to natural increase, improvements, growing crops, and rents not collected when the obligation falls due, and the value of indemnities allowed or due the owner for insurance on the property mortgaged, or by virtue of condemnation by right of eminent domain.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The same precept is repeated in detail and more extensively in the following article 111 of said law.<br\/><br\/>Article 1877 of the Civil Code contains the same precept but treats at greater length than in the preinserted article 110 of the Mortgage Law; it is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A mortgage includes the natural accessions, improvements, growing fruits, and rents not collected when the obligation is due, and the amount of the indemnities granted or due the owner by the underwriters of the property mortgaged or by virtue of the exercise of eminent domain by reason of public utility, with the declarations, amplifications, and limitations established by law, in case the estate continues in the possession of the person who mortgaged it, as well as when it passes into the hands of a third person.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>As may be seen from the doctrine established by the Supreme Court of Washington in its decision in the matter of The Royal Insurance Company <i>vs<\/i>. R. Miller, liquidator, and Amadeo (26 Sup. Ct. Rep., 46\u00b9) the above-quoted legal precepts in force in these Islands are in accord with the American laws:<br\/><blockquote>\"3.\u00a0 <i>Mortgage-Right of Mortgagee to Insurance on Harvested Crop<\/i>.-The avails of insurance on sugar and molasses coming into the sugar house on a sugar plantation as the result of the manufacture of a crop growing thereon when the insurance was effected inure to the benefit of the mortgagee in a mortgage of the realty and the fruits thereof if the loss occurred after the execution of the mortgage, under the Porto Rico Mortgage Law of 1880, which subjects to a mortgage of real property the crops growing or harvested when the mortgage falls due, 'but not yet removed or warehoused,' and the indemnities awarded or due the owner of the realty either for the insurance or for the crops, provided the damage occurred after the creation of the mortgage.<br\/><br\/>\"4.\u00a0 <i>Mortgage-Right of Mortgagee to Sue for Insurance without Exhausting Other Remedies<\/i>.-The mortgage creditor in a mortgage governed by the civil law may sue for the avails of insurance subject to his mortgage without first exhausting his remedies against other property embraced by the mortgage.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>So that even though no mention had been made of said machinery and tramway in the mortgage instrument, the mortgage of the property whereon they are located is understood by law to extend to them and they must be considered as included therein, as well as all\u00a0 other improvements, unless there was\u00a0 an express stipulation between the parties that they should be excluded.\u00a0 Such exclusion,\u00a0 however, certainly does not appear in the record; on the contrary,\u00a0 they are manifestly included in the mortgage.<br\/><br\/>It has already been stated that the machinery in question was already mounted on said property and was in use thereon when the mortgage given to secure the debt of Romana Ganzon to the original\u00a0 creditor, Lazaro Mota, was created; but even if this were not so, article 111 of the Mortgage Law, hereinbefore\u00a0 cited, provides that the following shall be considered as mortgaged with the estate, provided they belong to the owner of said estate, although they be not mentioned in the contract:<br\/><blockquote>\"1.\u00a0 Chattels permanently located in a building, either useful or ornamental, or for the service of some industry, even though they were placed there after the creation of the mortgage.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It should be noted that the said machinery and tramway were exclusively owned by Romania Ganzon, the owner of the hacienda, and at the time when the mortgage was made they\u00a0 had not yet been sold <i>a retro<\/i> to the plaintiff Bischoff; this sale was effected on November 8, 1904, long after the property was mortgaged.<br\/><br\/>Given the rights of dominion possessed by Romana Ganzon over the articles in question it is not possible to deny that she had the right to dispose of them, as she did, by sale under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> to the plaintiff, but the alienation thereof does not release them from the encumbrance to which they are subjected until redeemed from the mortgage that weighs upon them, since the right of the creditor limits that\u00a0 of the owner of the thing mortgaged, and the purchaser, assuming that he was able to effect\u00a0 a valid purchase, is necessarily bound to acknowledge and respect the encumbrance to which is subjected the purchased thing and which is at the disposal of the said creditor in order that he, under the terms of the contract, may recover the amount of his credit therefrom.<br\/><br\/>If it be a true and incontrovertible fact that at the time the plaintiff Bischoff acquired under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> the machinery and the tramway in question, they were already affected by and included in the mortgage of the Hacienda San Jose, the placing of the said hacienda, together with all of the property existing thereon in the hands of a receiver at the instance of the creditor, the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos, has not occasioned any damage to the plaintiff, inasmuch as the defendant limited itself to the exercise of a perfect right protected by law, and it is the duty of the plaintiff to respect the encumbrance that burdens the property acquired by him under these conditions, and therefore, he can not have acquired any right to indemnity for loss and damages, for the reason that he purchased goods that were already liable to the credit of the company that was the creditor of Romana Ganzon, and which latter sold them on <i>pacto de retro<\/i>; he therefore did not obtain possession of the same.<br\/><br\/>For the above considerations, and accepting the conclusions contained in the judgment appealed from in so far as they agree with the foregoing, it is our opinion that the same should be affirmed, without any ruling as to the costs of this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Mapa, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur,<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 199 U.

Quintero, justice of the peace of Manila, from which copy of the writ of execution it appears that said justice had rendered a judgment against the defendant and in favor of the plaintiff, on the 27th day of December, 1906, for the sum of P550 and costs.\u00a0 At the time of this judgment by the justice of the peace it is to be supposed, at least, that the defendant was in Bilibid Prison, serving the sentence of the Supreme Court, and the record does not disclose whether or not he was present during the trial or had received any notice of the action pending against him in said court of the justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>On the same day (the 3d day of January, 1907) the plaintiff and appellant presented another petition to the Court of First Instance, praying that the court order the clerk to pay to him, out of the money in his hands, the sum of P559.24, to apply on said judgment obtained before the justice of the peace.\u00a0 On the 4th day of January, 1907, the judge of the said Court of First Instance fixed the 5th day of January for the hearing on the said petition and ordered that the defendant be brought into court for this purpose of being heard upon said motion.\u00a0 The record discloses that the defendant was brought into court on the day fixed for the hearing and then and there stated to the court that he was willing that a portion of the money originally taken from him by the officer making the arrest might be applied upon the execution, but that he wished some of it reserved for his own use.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the respective parties, the judge of the lower court ordered that the clerk pay to the plaintiff and appellant, out of said money, the sum of P50 and further ordered that the balance should be retained by the clerk for the benefit of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>From this order of the lower court the plaintiff appealed.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff and appellant makes two assignments of error as follows:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the court erred in arbitrarily fixing the value of the services rendered by him in the trial of said cause at the sum of P50, and in not ordering the clerk to pay to him the sum of P550.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That the lower court erred in not ordering the clerk of the court to pay to the plaintiff or to the sheriff of the said court, a sum equal to the amount mentioned in said execution.<br\/><br\/>The fact is not denied that the money which the plaintiff and appellant is attempting to secure was taken from the defendant at the time of his arrest and was by such officer turned over to the clerk of the court.<br\/><br\/>An officer making an arrest may take from the person arrested any money or property found upon his person which was used in the commission of the crime or was the fruit of the crime or which might furnish the prisoner with the means of committing violence or of escaping, or which may be used as evidence in the trial of the cause; but there is very serious doubt whether an officer making an arrest has the right to take from the defendant any property found upon his person, unless for some of the reasons just mentioned.\u00a0 (Rex <i>vs<\/i>. Burgis, 7 Carrington and Payne, English Reports, 488; Houghton <i>vs<\/i>. Bachman, 47 Barber, N. Y., 388; 1st Bishop's Criminal Procedure, sees. 210-212.)<br\/><br\/>Unless some of these special reasons exist the officer should not deprive the defendant of the possession of his property.\u00a0 (Rex <i>vs<\/i>. Johnson, 11 Modern Reports, English, 62; Rex <i>vs<\/i>. Jones, 6 Carrington and Payne, 343.)<br\/><br\/>To deprive the defendant of his money or property under other circumstances than those mentioned above is to deprive him, perhaps, of the lawful means of defense. (Rex <i>vs<\/i>. Jones, <i>supra<\/i>; Clark's Criminal Procedure, 71; 1st Bishop's Criminal Procedure, sees. 210-212.)<br\/><br\/>But what becomes of the property of the person arrested when the officer making the arrest has taken possession of the same and after the termination of the trial it appears conclusively that such property was in no way connected with the commission of the offense for which the defendant was arrested?\u00a0 If the property was in no way connected with the commission of the offense, at the termination of the trial it is the duty of the court to order the officer in possession of the same to return it to the defendant.\u00a0 The custody of the officer of such property in no way deprives the defendant of his right therein and such custody should be considered as the custody of the defendant under these circumstances.<br\/><br\/>But the question arises, may third persons, creditor's for example of the defendant, obtain a lien or claim upon such property while it is in the possession of such officer?\u00a0 We are of the opinion, and so hold, that third persons, creditors, etc., can not acquire any claim or lien upon such property while thus in the hands of the officer, which they might not acquire had the property remained in the custody of the defendant himself.\u00a0 To hold otherwise would lead to unlawful and forcible searches of the person under cover of criminal process as an aid to civil actions for the collection of debts.\u00a0 When it is fully shown that the property so taken was in no way connected with the crime charged, the court should not permit any advantage to be taken of the defendant, by reason of the fact that he had been deprived of his property by the officer and against his will.\u00a0 (Commercial Exchange Bank <i>vs<\/i>. McLeod, 65 Iowa, 665; 54 American Reports, 36; 1 Archibald Criminal Pleading and Procedure, 34, 35; Wharton-s Criminal Pleading and Practice, sec, 61.)<br\/><br\/>It is therefore, the duty of the judge, under facts such as existed in this case, at the close of the trial to order such property returned to the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court is therefore hereby reversed and it is hereby ordered that the cause be remanded to the lower court with direction that an order be issued returning to the defendant the money or property which was taken from his person at the time of his arrest.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Its execution was not denied under oath by the defendant but he alleged that it was given, not for a loan of money, but for amounts which he had lost to the plaintiff and others at the game of <i>monte<\/i>.\u00a0 Judgment was entered in the court below in favor of the plaintiff for 11,000 pesos and the defendant has appealed;<br\/><br\/>At the opening of the trial in the court below the plaintiff presented no evidence.\u00a0 The defendant thereupon moved to dismiss the case for failure of proof.\u00a0 This motion was denied by the court below for the reason that the obligation sued upon having been copied into the complaint and the defendant not having denied its execution under oath, he had admitted it (sec. 103, Code of Civil Procedure), and no evidence was therefore necessary to show that he owed the amount claimed.\u00a0 This view of the law was entirely correct.\u00a0 The burden of proving payment, or any similar defense, was upon the defendant.\u00a0 (Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Rosatzin, 5 Phil. Rep., 660; Merchant<i> vs<\/i>. International Bank, 9 Phil. Rep., 554.)<br\/><br\/>Upon the merits of the controversy, the evidence in the case strongly preponderates in favor of the plaintiff.\u00a0 He had in his favor, in the first place, the obligation itself, which was a solemn statement before a notary public by the defendant himself to the effect that the money was paid to him in cash as a loan.\u00a0 There was also the testimony of the plaintiff, who stated that he had never played <i>monte<\/i> with the defendant and that the money was furnished by him to the defendant as a loan, which was sought by one Aviles, a broker, acting for the defendant.\u00a0 Aviles testified that, at the request of the defendant, he negotiated with the plaintiff for this loan, was present when it was consummated and saw the money paid by the plaintiff to the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The only testimony to overcome this evidence was the declaration of the defendant, who said that he never gambled with the plaintiff but once; that on that occasion he lost 15,000 pesos to the several people present, among whom was the plaintiff; that the entire amount lost by him to the various players was put into one sum and an obligation for 15,000 pesos was executed in favor of the plaintiff, and that two or three days later this obligation, which was in the form of a note, was destroyed, and the document sued upon executed before the notary public.\u00a0 He stated that among the players was one Zamora.\u00a0 Zamora was called as a witness by the defendant, but instead of corroborating the latter's testimony, he stated that he never had,gambled in the house of the plaintiff.\u00a0 This is practically all of the evidence in the case, because we consider of no importance the testimony of the witness for the defendant who said that an obligation similar to the one in question had been offered for sale to him at a discount of 25 per cent.<br\/><br\/>If such evidence as this were sufficient to destroy the value of an obligation such as the one sued upon, it would be difficult to see how any person with a genuine document of this character would be secure in his rights.\u00a0 It is hardly necessary to say that this case must be decided upon the evidence presented to the judge who tried it and not upon evidence presented to other judges in other cases relating to this transaction or other transactions between Martinez and other persons and which have come to our knowledge.<br\/><br\/>The defendant also alleged in his answer that after the execution of the obligation he had compromised and settled it by the payment of 4,000 pesos to the plaintiff.\u00a0 The payment of the 4,000 pesos was admitted, but the plaintiff claims that it was on account.\u00a0 It was admitted that the receipt which the plaintiff gave the defendant when the payment was made expressly stated that it was on account.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, however, said that the payment was in full settlement of the entire obligation and that he did not read the receipt when it was given to him because he had Confidence in the plaintiff and his attention was not called to the fact that the receipt stated that it was on account until sometime afterwards.\u00a0 He made the payment by a check on the International Bank and when he learned what the terms of the receipt were he ordered the bank to stop payment on the check.\u00a0 This was done.\u00a0 The plaintiff had several interviews with the manager of the bank in which he attempted to collect the check but was unsuccessful.\u00a0 He thereupon placed it in the hands of his lawyers and after an interview with the bank the check was paid.<br\/><br\/>The evidence supports the finding of the court below, that there was no settlement of the entire obligation by this payment of 4,000 pesos.\u00a0 If the claim of the defendant is true, it is difficult to understand why he finally consented to the payment of the check.<br\/><br\/>The defendant also complains because the court refused to continue the case to allow him to present other witnesses.\u00a0 The trial was commenced on November 8, 1907.\u00a0 At the opening of the court on November 9, counsel for the defendant stated that some of his witnesses were in the provinces and he asked for a continuance until after the rebuttal of the plaintiff, saying that if there was no rebuttal, then he had no more evidence to offer.\u00a0 He stated that he had two witnesses, one living in Mindoro and the other in Pangasinan.\u00a0 The court said the witnesses would be allowed, but only for rebuttal of the plaintiff's proofs.\u00a0 The plaintiff did present evidence in rebuttal.\u00a0 After the rebuttal evidence of the plaintiff was presented, the defendant presented one witness and then asked for a continuance until the end of the month in order that he might bring his witnesses from the province.\u00a0 This was opposed by the plaintiff but the court continued the case until the 13th of November.\u00a0 On the 13th of November the witnesses not being present, counsel for the defense asked for a further continuance, which was objected to by the plaintiff, but the court continued the case to the 19th of November.\u00a0 On the 19th of November, the defendant stated that his witnesses had not yet arrived and asked for a further continuance, which the court refused to grant.\u00a0 It is apparent that in this ruling there was no error.<br\/><br\/>The defendant states that the court committed an error in not compelling the witness George to testify.\u00a0 Mr. George, who is the prosecuting attorney, was called by the defendant for the purpose of testifying as to certain statements which had been made by Luis Santos, deceased, in reference to this and other transactions connected with the defendant Martinez.\u00a0 The court refused to allow the evidence on the ground that it was hearsay.\u00a0 This ruling was clearly correct as the supposed statements by the deceased Santos did not come within any of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure allowing testimony to be given as to declarations made by deceased persons.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

chapel of the Presbyterian faith was to be inaugurated in the barrio of Santander in the pueblo of\u00a0 Oslob in the Province of Cebu.\u00a0 Ricardo Alonso, a Protestant minister in Oslob, with some 40 or 50 people left Oslob at or about 2 o'clock in the afternoon of the 14th of December to attend this ceremony at Santander on the 15th.\u00a0 They arrived at Santander about 7 o'clock in the evening of the 14th and were lodged in various houses of members of the Presbyterian Church.\u00a0 On the morning of the 15th, Sunday, the Protestants, in number about 80, with Alonso at their head, left the chapel on the east side of the small stream which separated that part of the barrio from the principal part on the west side, where were situated the Roman Catholic Church, convent and public buildings, crossed the bridge over this stream and reached a place near, if not within, the plaza of the Roman Catholic Church.\u00a0 They did this for the purpose of holding services in the open air, but arriving at the point named they saw the defendant Daniel Ferejoles leave a house near the church and advance toward them brandishing a lance.\u00a0 Fearing, as the witnesses say, that they were about to be attacked by the Roman Catholics, they abandoned the idea of holding a service\u00a0 there and returned across the bridge to their chapel.\u00a0 This took place at 8 or half past 8 in the morning.\u00a0 All the witnesses agree that there was no contest of any kind between the Protestants and the Catholics upon this occasion.<br\/><br\/>It appears that at the time the Protestants arrived on the Catholic side, mass was about to begin in the Roman Catholic Church and that either the appellant, who was the parish priest, or one of the councilmen, ordered all the men to go outside the church and defend it while the women stayed inside.\u00a0 There was testimony also on the part of the defense that the Protestants stated on this occasion that they came to kill the priest and burn the church.\u00a0 As has been said, however, nothing was done.\u00a0 The Protestants retired to their side of the stream, went to the chapel and held a service there which was finished about 10 o'clock.\u00a0 The celebration of the mass in the Roman Catholic Church was finished about that time and after the Protestants had concluded their services and the principal members, including Alonso, had retired to the house of Mariano Bureros for luncheon, and Aloriso and three or four companions had finished luncheon, the defendant appeared upon the Protestant side, followed by a band which, according to the witnesses, numbered from two to four hundred persons, the appellant armed with a revolver and a saber, the defendant Daniel Ferejoles with a lance, and the defendant Adriano Culaniban a bolo, and other members of the party with bolos and clubs.\u00a0 The appellant ordered his followers to advance and kill the Protestants.\u00a0 Balbino Lozano was slain by Daniel Ferejoles and Adriano Culaniban.\u00a0 Upon the arrival of the band of Catholics headed by the appellant and upon noting the death of Balbino Lozano, all of the Protestants fled from the place toward\u00a0 Oslob, where they arrived some hours later.\u00a0 The Catholics then apparently returned to their side of the stream, but later came back, destroyed the furniture in the Protestant chapel and destroyed the furniture in several of the houses belonging to the Protestants.<br\/><br\/>Upon the arrival of Alonso at Oslob at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, he gave notice to the president of what had taken place, and the latter sent five policemen to Santander who, upon arrival there, found a body of men gathered about the church, armed.\u00a0 They took away from these people, who were all Catholics, some 30 weapons, including bolos and other arms.<br\/><br\/>A complaint was filed in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Cebu charging the appellant and others with the crime of assassination.\u00a0 The appellant demanded and was granted a separate trial, was convicted of the crime of homicide and sentenced to seventeen years, four months, and one day of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i>.\u00a0 From this judgment he has appealed.<br\/><ol><li>The appellant alleges that the court below erred in overruling his demurrer to the complaint, the demurrer being based upon the ground that the complaint was not sufficient to charge the crime of assassination.\u00a0 If this order of the court were error, it could not in any way prejudice the appellant because the court did not convict him of assassination but of homicide, and no question is made but that the complaint was sufficient as a complaint for the latter crime.<br\/><\/li><li>The second error assigned is to the effect that the court erred in permitting certain clerks attached to the court to administer the oaths to the witnesses.\u00a0 No objection was made by the appellant to this manner of administering the oaths at the time it was done, and he thereby waived any objection thereto.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Barroquillo,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> R. G. No. 4884, decided January 5,1909.)<br\/><\/li><li>The appellant says that the court below erred in holding that the Protestants were not armed when they crossed the bridge and entered upon the Catholic side of the river.\u00a0 The evidence preponderates in favor of this finding of the court, but to our minds it has no bearing upon the decision of the case.\u00a0 According to the witnesses, more than an hour and a half elapsed between the time when the Protestants left the Catholic side of the river and the time when the Catholics advanced from their side and committed the crime charged in the complaint.\u00a0 It also appears that the parties did not come in contact with each other in any way while the Protestants were on the Catholic side.\u00a0 It may be that the Protestants made a mistake in attempting to hold a service where they did, but this mistake in no way justified the Catholics, after waiting an hour and a half, in attacking the Protestants and killing Balbino Lozano.<br\/><\/li><li>The appellant's counsel criticises the testimony of several witnesses for the Government, claiming that they contradicted themselves to such an extent as to make their testimony without weight.\u00a0 But nothing is said in the brief about a great many other witnesses whose testimony was direct and positive as to the facts above narrated, and we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the affair occurred as has been stated.<br\/><\/li><\/ol>That the appellant is guilty as a principal, is well settled by the authorities.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Abelinde, 1 Phil. Rep., 568; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Santos, 2 Phil. Rep., 453; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Asilo, 4 Phil. Rep., 175.)<br\/><br\/>The court below held that there existed the fourteenth aggravating circumstance mentioned in article 10 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 It seems to us that the aggravating circumstance applicable is that of <i>cuadrilla<\/i>, and considering this as proved, the penalty falls where the court placed it, in the maximum degree of <i>reclusion temporal.<\/i><br\/><br\/>After the record had been brought to this court the appellant presented a motion for a new trial, based upon newly discovered evidence.\u00a0 The alleged newly discovered evidence consists of affidavits presented by five different persons who claim to have been in or about the Roman Catholic Church on the morning of December 15.\u00a0 In some respects these affidavits support the case of the Government, but in so far as they do not, they can not change the result which was reached from a consideration of the other evidence offered in the case.\u00a0 Moreover, there is no proper showing of the diligence which was used prior to the trial for the purpose of securing this evidence.\u00a0 The appellant himself has presented no affidavit of any kind.\u00a0 In fact the only paper presented with the affidavits is a statement signed by the present counsel for the appellant, who did not act as counsel for him in the court below, in which he states that the appellant did not know that these persons could testify in his favor.\u00a0 This is not sufficient.\u00a0 The motion is denied.<br\/><br\/>The sentence of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

the prosecuting attorney of the Province of Capiz presented in the Court of First Instance of that province the following complaint:<br\/><blockquote>\"That on the 28th day of June, 1907, said accused were holding the office of election inspectors for the first precinct of the municipality of Calibo, Province of Capiz, the three persons above named constituting the board of inspectors of said precinct, and as such board of inspectors they held on the aforesaid day an ordinary meeting in the precinct of the municipality of Calibo, for the purpose of registering the voters duly qualified in said precinct for the election of a Delegate to the First Philippine Assembly; that Juan Policarpio, being a duly qualified voter of said precinct, appeared before the said inspectors and asked that he be registered as a voter; but, that the said inspectors willfully, intentionally, illegally, and feloniously refused and prevented the registration of the name of Juan Policarpio in the registry, and refused to administer to him the elector's oath prescribed by section 17 of the Election Law, thereby violating the provisions of section 29 of the said law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>To this complaint the defendants demurred, which demurrer was later overruled by the judge of that court, to which ruling of the court the defendants duly excepted.<br\/><br\/>On the 31st day of October, 1907, the defendants were duly arraigned and each pleaded \"not guilty.\"<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial, the lower court found each of the defendants guilty of the crime charged in the complaint and sentenced each of them to pay a fine of P300 and costs, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment at the rate of P2 per day, until said fine and costs were fully paid, which subsidiary imprisonment should in no case exceed an imprisonment of six months.\u00a0 From this sentence of the lower court the defendants each appealed.<br\/><br\/>No question was raised in this court as to the sufficiency of the complaint.\u00a0 The complaint charges that the defendants, being inspectors of election in the municipality of Calibo of the Province of Capiz, did on the 28th of June, 1907, voluntarily, knowingly, illegally, and criminally refuse to allow one Juan Policarpio to register as a voter in the said municipality.<br\/><br\/>During the trial the prosecuting attorney attempted to prove that the said Juan Policarpio was a resident of the municipality of\u00a0 Calibo and was entitled to be registered as a voter of said municipality; that the defendants knew that the said Policarpio was a resident of the said municipality and that he was entitled to be registered but that they fraudulently and corruptly refused him the right to register as a voter.<br\/><br\/>During the trial the defendants attempted to prove that one or more of them personally knew the said Policarpio and knew that\u00a0 he\u00a0 had not resided in the said pueblo for many years, and especially during the six months immediately preceding the time of registration.<br\/><br\/>At the time the said Policarpio presented himself for registration, he presented his personal cedula issued by the authorities of the city of Manila, which gave his residence) as the city of Manila.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the fact that the cedula stated that his residence was in Manila, the said Policarpio claimed that he presented several witnesses to the said inspectors, who stated to the inspectors that he, Policarpio, was\u00a0 a resident of the pueblo of Calibo.\u00a0 The defendants deny that Policarpio presented any proof whatever of his residence except his cedula.<br\/><br\/>Section 17 of Act No. 1582, as amended by section 4 of Act No. 1709, provides that the inspectors of election shall hold four meetings before any election at a designated place, for the purpose of preparing a list of names and residences of the persons qualified to vote, in the precinct in which they are acting as such inspectors.\u00a0 Said Act also provides the manner in which the list of names, etc., shall be arranged, and also provides that before the name of any resident shall be entered upon this list, he shall take an oath, prescribed by said law.<br\/><br\/>Said Act provides that any person who applies for registration at any of the four meetings of the board may be challenged by any of the inspectors or by any qualified elector of the precinct.\u00a0 In case of a challenge, the board shall examine such person and shall\u00a0 hear such other evidence as shall to them seem necessary, with respect to the qualifications or disqualifications of the applicant for registration.\u00a0 If the board finds that such applicant is entitled to be registered, they shall enter his name upon the list of voters.\u00a0 If they find that he is disqualified, they have a right to refuse to allow such person to register, and if his name had been already entered upon the list of voters, the board has a right to strike the same therefrom.<br\/><br\/>In the investigation of this question of qualification of the applicant for registration, the election board has authority to call witnesses and compel their attendance.<br\/><br\/>The law provides that the inspection board shall decide the question as to the qualification of the applicant for registration without delay.\u00a0 The law further provides that in case the applicant is refused the right to register, he may appeal to the provincial board of the province or to the judge of the Court of First Instance of said province, for the purpose of having his name placed upon the list of voters.<br\/><br\/>In the present case the record does not disclose whether the applicant appealed to the provincial board or to the Court of First Instance of said province.<br\/><br\/>Section 29 of said Act provides, among other things, that\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"Any inspector or poll clerk who knowingly enters upon any registry or poll list or causes or allows to be entered thereon the name of any person as a voter in a district who\u00a0 is not a voter thereof, and any inspector of election who refuses or willfully votes to refuse or willfully neglects to enter the name of any qualified applicant for registration upon the registry list, or who knowingly prevents or seeks to prevent the registration of any legally qualified voter * * * shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one month, nor more than one year, or by a fine of not less than two hundred pesos, nor more than five hundred pesos, or both, in the discretion of the court.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It will be noted that this paragraph provides that if any inspector <i>knowingly<\/i> enters, etc., the name of any person as a voter, etc., who is not a voter, or who refuses or willfully votes to refuse or willfully neglects to enter the name of any qualified applicant, etc., shall be punished.<br\/><br\/>It will be noted that in said section 17, above quoted, the board\u00a0 of inspectors were given the right to decide in the first instance\u00a0 whether or\u00a0 not a particular applicant for registration was legally entitled to be registered or not.\u00a0 This authority is in the nature of a judicial capacity conferred upon the inspectors.\u00a0 Having thus been given judicial capacity or quasi-judicial capacity to decide the question whether or not a particular applicant is entitled to register, we are of the opinion and so hold, that such inspectors of election can not be punished under the provisions of section 29 until it is shown, beyond question, that such inspectors, <i>knowingly, willfully<\/i>, and <i>maliciously<\/i> entered upon the poll list or <i>knowingly, willfully<\/i>, and <i>maliciously refused to permit<\/i> the entry upon such list of the name of any applicant for registration.<br\/><br\/>Under the provisions of the law evidently the inspectors of election have a right not only to call witnesses for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not a particular applicant is entitled to be registered, but they may act upon their own knowledge with reference to the qualifications of such applicant, and if they act honestly and without willfulness or maliciousness they can not be held to be criminally responsible.\u00a0 It is only when they knowingly, willfully, and maliciously register or refuse or vote to refuse to register one who is not entitled to be registered, or\u00a0 one who is entitled to be registered, that they can be punished criminally.\u00a0 The mere fact that they have registered or refused or voted to refuse to register one who is entitled to be registered or one who is not entitled to be registered, is not sufficient, under the law, to make the inspectors of election criminally responsible.\u00a0 It must be shown, beyond peradventure of doubt, that the acts of said inspectors in such a case were done knowingly, willfully, and maliciously.<br\/><br\/>In the present case, in our opinion, the record does not disclose facts sufficient to show that the defendants did knowingly, willfully, and maliciously refuse to allow the said Juan Policarpio to register, and therefore the sentence of the lower court is hereby revoked and it is hereby ordered that the said\u00a0 cause be dismissed and that the defendants be discharged from the custody of the law.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that from September, 1906, to the 15th of May, 1907, the debtor had paid on account the sum of P160, which deducted from the amount loaned the defendant leaves P1,234 still owing to the plaintiff; and that since the 16th of June, 1907, Wenceslaua Damian, in violation of the contract, had failed to pay the balance of her indebtedness, notwithstanding the many friendly demands made therefor; for said reason the plaintiff prayed the court to enter judgment in her favor ordering that the said contract be canceled through noncompliance on the part of the defendant; that the latter be sentenced to pay to the plaintiff the sum of Pl,234 with interest thereon from the 16th of June aforesaid, until full payment is made, and that she be also sentenced to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendant's demurrer was overruled.\u00a0 She excepted to the overruling and in answer to the complaint set forth; that by reason of the continued absence of her husband, Teodoro Pati\u00f1o, since the month of June, 1908, she presented her answer without his assistance; that she still maintained and again set forth her exception to the order overruling the demurrer because she had not been notified of the hearing thereon; that she denied the first part because she was a resident of the municipality of San Roque, Cavite, at the time when the summons were served on her; that she denied paragraphs 2, 4, and 5 of the complaint for the reason that the amount claimed was more than sufficiently covered by the value of several pieces of jewelry set with diamonds which her creditor had received for sale on commission, the proceeds to apply toward the payment of the sum of P1,394, in addition to the amounts paid in by the defendant on account of said debt which were more than the amount stated in paragraph 4 of the complaint, without having violated the obligation contracted by her; and that as special\u00a0 defense she alleged that the plaintiff received several pieces of jewelry from her which are described and valued at P3,000 for the aforesaid purpose, the balance of the value thereof to be returned to the defendant, but that the plaintiff had not even rendered an accounting for the sale of said jewels nor for the total value of the same as had been agreed upon between them; that as alleged in paragraph 3 of the complaint the amount loaned should be gradually paid by monthly installments of P20, for which reason the subject of the complaint could only be the amount due and not paid from the 16th of June, 1907, to May, 1908, when the complaint was filed, which, according to the statement of the plaintiff herself, should be P240; that in view of the terms of the contract an action brought to rescind the same did not lie; that as a counterclaim the defendant claimed from the plaintiff the sum of P2,000, balance of the proceeds of the said jewelry with the legal interest thereon, and finally prayed that judgment be entered absolving her of the complaint, and sentencing the plaintiff to pay the amount demanded in the counterclaim with legal interest thereon and costs.<br\/><br\/>In reply to the foregoing answer the plaintiff set forth that paragraphs 1 and 2 of said answer should be stricken out as incompetent and immaterial, and denied each and every one of the statements made in said answer, special defense, and counterclaim with the exception of such as are admitted in the following special defense, wherein she states that on or about the 6th of July, 1904, the defendants delivered to the plaintiff a bill of sale, for the sum of $4,000, Mexican currency, with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> for one year from date, and witnessed by a notary, for three houses of light material and\u00a0 several pieces of jewelry described in the defendant's answer; that on or about the 10th of October, 1905, after a liquidation was made of the debt of the defendant, Wenceslaua Damian, being duly authorized by her husband, Teodoro Pati\u00f1o, as she was unable to fulfill the agreement contained in the said deed, executed and delivered to the plaintiff a new bill of sale, ratified before the same notary, for two houses of light material and the same jewelry for the sum of P2,404, with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, from the said 10th of October, 1905, for the term of one year with the right to extend it for another year; that on the 19th of February, 1906, the defendants duly authorized the\u00a0 creditor to\u00a0 sell the jewelry which she held as security for the debt; that on the 26th of July, 1906, the plaintiff declared before a notary that all the jewelry mentioned had a market value of P875, and at that price sold them with the acquiescence of the defendant debtor, and in like manner acknowledged to have received from the defendant the sum of P135, for which reason the sum paid on account of the debt amounted to Pl,010, which, being deducted from the P2,404 mentioned above, left a balance of Pl,394 in favor of the plaintiff, which balance has been acknowledged by the parties in litigation by means of another instrument dated September 19, 1906, which is cited in the complaint.\u00a0 In view of all of the foregoing the plaintiff prays the court to render judgment in accordance with what she had previously requested in her complaint, and that she be absolved of the counterclaim interposed by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The case came up for trial and the testimony and documents offered in evidence were made of record; the trial court in view of the result entered judgment on the 26th of December, 1908, holding that the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendant the sum of P250, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 2d of June, 1908, with costs, without prejudice to an action to recover such other installments as might become due upon maturity under the provisions of the document on which the complaint is based.\u00a0 The defendant excepted to the foregoing judgment and by a writing dated the same day, December 29, 1908, prayed that the same be vacated and a new trial held for the reason that the said judgment was contrary to the weight of the evidence and to the law, as there is no legal provision in force which provides for the amendment of said decision; the motion was overruled on the 22d of January of this year, to which the petitioner excepted and presented the corresponding bill of exceptions which, notwithstanding the opposition of the appellee, was approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The controversy in the present action refers on the one hand to the annullment of the contract set forth in the document marked Exhibit A, and the recovery of P1,234, with legal interest thereon from the 16th of June, 1907, as claimed by the plaintiff from the defendant who owes the same; and on the other to the payment of P2,000 which the latter claims the plaintiff should pay as a counterclaim.<br\/><br\/>The spouses Teodoro Pati\u00f1o and Wenceslaua Damian were indebted to Francisca Jose since July, 1904, in the sum of P4,000, which appears from the document marked \"B\" to be the result of the sale of three houses of light material situated in Sampaloc and of a quantity of jewelry described therein, payable by installments within the period of one year.\u00a0 By means of payments made the debt was subsequently reduced to P2,404 and this amount is the result of another sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> of two houses of light material situated in San Roque, Cavite, and of several pieces of jewelry described in the document marked \"C\" by the terms of which the\u00a0 defendant, as the seller, duly authorized by her husband, bound herself to settle the said amount in the manner and under the terms agreed upon in the aforesaid document executed on the 10th of October, 1905.<br\/><br\/>Both documents appear to have been ratified before a notary who signed a note dated October 10, 1905, at the foot of the first one marked \"B\" to the effect that from said date the said document or instrument marked \"B\" was null and void.<br\/><br\/>In July, 1906, the creditor, for the purpose of effecting a payment on account, by realizing on the jewelry pledged by the debtor, after obtaining the latter's consent and with her husband's authority sold said jewelry for P875, which amount added to the P135 received on account made a total of Pl,010, and deducting said sum from the P2,404, the amount of the indebtedness shown by the document marked \"C,\" there resulted a balance of P1,394 in favor of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>On the 19th of September, 1906, after the sale of said jewelry, the defendant debtor, authorized by her husband, executed in favor of the plaintiff creditor the instrument marked \"A\" which was ratified before the same notary, wherein among other things appears the following:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"That I, Do\u00f1a Wenceslaua Damian, have settled with the other party here present, Do\u00f1a Francisca Jose, the balance of the amount in which I am indebted to her, with the result that, by reason of several payments made by me aggregating P1,010 Conant, I still owe Do\u00f1a Francisca Jose the sum of P1,394 Conant; that by mutual agreement between both parties herein, I, the debtor, bind myself to pay to Do\u00f1a Francisca Jose the sum of P20 Conant until the whole of my indebtedness, amounting to P1,394 Conant, is paid, said payment of P20 Conant, to be made at the end of each month at the residence of Do\u00f1a Francisca Jose, No. 25, Calle Ricafort, Tondo, and said monthly payments shall be witnessed by receipts signed by Do\u00f1a Francisca Jose.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>It is stated in the complaint that the defendant has paid on account of her debt of P1,394, installments of P20 for the eight and a half months from September, 1906, to May 15, 1907, that is to say, the sum of P170 and not P160 as appears therein; and deducting said amount from the total indebtedness we find that at the time when the complaint was filed, May 4, 1908, the defendant still owed Pl,224.<br\/><br\/>The existence and correctness of the indebtedness is unquestionable for the reason that it is fully proven by documentary evidence which has not been properly impugned or contradicted; and the contention for release from payment which the defendant endeavored to establish in her brief completely fails of justification and appears to be overthrown by the notarial document and other authentic papers of a private character offered in evidence by the plaintiff during the trial of the case.<br\/><br\/>Several months before the document Exhibit C was executed by the defendant Damian on October 10, 1905, her husband, Teodoro Pati\u00f1o, by means of a notarial instrument dated August 29, of said year, granted her ample power and authority to enter into all kinds of contracts, to administer the property of the conjugal copartnership and to appear before the courts in order to exercise and maintain their rights and interests; therefore, the defendant had legal capacity to contract and to execute the documents marked \"A\" and \"C,\" and also to act as defendant in this litigation apart\u00a0 from the fact that although her husband had been duly summoned to appear in these proceedings he decided not to do so, and being well aware of his rights and duties left the matter of the present litigation completely in the hands\u00a0 of his wife; therefore, the two errors assigned to the judgment appealed from are unfounded and inadmissible.<br\/><br\/>The record does not show that any legal or just reason exists or was therein provided which would call for the cancellation of the contract contained in the document or instrument marked \"A,\" and for that reason the matter does not fall within any of the provisions referred to in articles 1290 to 1297 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>As to the manner stipulated between the contracting parties, in which the debt was to be paid, as provided in said instrument marked \"A,\" that the debtor, in order to extinguish the indebtedness, would pay P20 at the expiration of each month, beginning in September when the document was dated, no legal reason exists to prevent the slow payment agreed to.\u00a0 Contracting parties may establish such covenants clauses, and conditions as they may deem fit, as long as they are not contrary to law, to morals, or to public order.\u00a0 (Art 1255, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The complaint was filed claiming payment of the whole debt in view of the failure of the debtor to pay the installments agreed upon, and as the said instrument of indebtedness does not state that the failure to pay any of the installments would entitle the creditor to recover the total amount of the debt, and it not appearing that a subsequent agreement providing therefor had been entered into, the decision in the present controversy must be governed by the agreement entered into between the parties, it being the only law governing the matter, as provided by section 285 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the trial Judge held in conformity with the doctrine repeatedly established in jurisprudence, that when a debt is payable in installments, according to agreement between the parties, partial amounts remaining unpaid at the time of the filing of the complaint can alone be claimed unless there should exist a stipulation to the contrary.\u00a0 (Decisions Nos. 3019, 7 Phil. Rep., 455;\u00b9 3584, 8 Phil. Rep., 677; \u00b2 4123, 9 Phil. Rep., 210,\u00b3 and others cited in the judgment appealed from.)<br\/><br\/>From the 16th of May, 1907, to the 2d of June, 1908, twelve months and a half have elapsed, without counting the days of June, that is, twelve and a half installments at the rate of P20 each, and therefore, according to the agreement in the above-mentioned document A, the conditions of which are sanctioned by law and the established rules of courts, the plaintiff was only entitled to recover and receive the P250 due for the twelve and a half months when her complaint was filed.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the interest on said amount, article 1755 of the Civil Code\u00a0 provides that no interest shall accrue except when the same has been expressly agreed to; and in view of the fact that it does not appear from the said document that it was agreed between the parties that the said sum would earn interest, and on the other hand as it has not been proven that the creditor had ever demanded extra-judicially from the debtor the settlement of her indebtedness in order that it might be considered as having become delinquent according to article 1100 of said code, there can be no question that the obligation to pay the legal interest on account of the debt as an indemnity for loss and damage shall count from the month of June at which time the complaint was filed.\u00a0 (Arts. 1108 and 1109 of said code.)<br\/><br\/>For the reason above set forth it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

MATEO CUNANAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT,<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Pampanga, for a divorce and for a division of the marital property.<br\/><br\/>On the 25th day of February, 1906, after hearing the respective parties, the court rendered a decision containing the following order or decree:<br\/><br\/>\"It is hereby ordered, that judgment be entered granting a divorce between the plaintiff and the defendant, and declaring the conjugal partnership formed between both of them to be dissolved on this date; and in order to wind up the partnership in these same proceedings, the administrator of said partnership, Mateo Cunanan, is hereby ordered to file with the court a true and exact\u00a0 inventory which shall comprise the capital contributed by him, his wife's dowry and paraphernalia, as well as the property acquired during the existence of the said partnership, with the costs against the defendant.\"<br\/><br\/>On the 4th day of March, 1909, the defendant presented a motion for a new trial based upon the ground that the facts adduced during the trial of the cause did not justify the conclusions of the lower court, which motion was denied upon the 13th day of March, 1909.\u00a0 On the same day the defendant excepted to the order of the court denying his motion for a new trial.\u00a0 On the 28th day of March, 1909, the defendant presented his bill of exceptions.\u00a0 On the 22d\u00a0 day of March, 1909, the attorney for the plaintiff presented the following motion, asking that the appeal of the defendant be not allowed:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Now comes the plaintiff in the above-entitled case and respectfully prays the\u00a0 court:<br\/><br\/>\"1. That the bill of exceptions presented by the defendant be overruled for the reason that the decision rendered in this case is not final; therefore, it is not appealable.<br\/><br\/>\"2. That a peremptory term be fixed for the defendant to comply with the decision of the court with reference to the inventory of the property and the fruits thereof, with a warning as to contempt, on the ground that said measure is necessary for the proper execution of said part of the decision.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>After hearing the respective parties, the lower court, upon the 16th day of June, 1909, denied the motion of the plaintiff in the following language:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"After considering the motion presented in this case on the 23d of March, 1909, by the representative of the plaintiff, the court holds that the decision entered in this case is final, and that the presentation of the inventory as ordered therein in order to wind up the conjugal partnership is nothing more than a consequence of the declaration of divorce; therefore, the motion is denied.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>On the 16th day of June, 1909, the court approved and certified the\u00a0 bill of exceptions in said cause.<br\/><br\/>On the 9th day of July, 1909, after the bill of exceptions had been received in this court, the attorney for the appellee presented the following motion:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Now comes the appellee and through his undersigned attorney respectfully prays this honorable court to dismiss with costs the bill of exceptions submitted by the appellant, for the reason that the same is not in accordance with the law, and because the controversy has not been properly submitted to this high tribunal by means of the said bill of exceptions, inasmuch as it is not <i>final<\/i>; therefore, the decision rendered in this cause by the court below is not subject to appeal.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>The question presented is, Was the decision of the lower court final and appealable?<br\/><br\/>The complaint filed in the cause in the court below contained a statement of the facts upon which the plaintiff claimed a decree of divorce, as well as the facts upon which she claimed a division of the marital property and concluded with the following prayer:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"1. That a divorce between the plaintiff and the defendant be granted by the court.<br\/><br\/>\"2. That an account between the parties be made up by the court as to the property acquired during the marriage, and that the same be divided between the parties in conformity with the law.<br\/><br\/>\"3. That the court hold that all the property owned by the plaintiff prior to her marriage with the defendant is <i>per se<\/i> entirely free from any right of administration, or any other right on the part of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>\"4. That pending a final decision in this matter the court be pleased to issue an injunction prohibiting the defendant, the lawyers who represent him, his agents or subordinates, from disposing of, pledging or mortgaging any portion of the marital property until further order of this court.<br\/><br\/>\"5. That the plaintiff be granted by the court any other relief that it may deem just and equitable.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>By reference to the prayer of the petition it will be noted that the lower court in its decree filed in the present case, resolved only a part of the question presented by the plaintiff.\u00a0 Under the provisions of section 123 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, it will he noted that \"no interlocutory or incidental ruling, order, or judgment of the Court of First Instance shall stay the progress of an action or proceeding therein pending, but only such ruling, order, or judgment, <i>as finally determines the action or proceeding<\/i>; nor shall any ruling, order, or judgment be the subject of appeal to the Supreme Court until <i>final judgment is rendered for one party or the other.\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>Section 143 of said code\u00a0 provides as follows:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Upon the rendition of <i>final judgment, disposing of the action<\/i>, either party shall have the right to perfect a bill of exceptions for review by the Supreme Court of all rulings, orders, and judgments made in the action, to which the party has duly excepted at the time of making such ruling, order, or judgment.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>These two sections provide that (a) no appeal shall be allowed from\u00a0 an interlocutory ruling, order or judgment of the Court of First Instance; and (b) that bills of exception shall only be allowed upon <i>final judgment<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>It will be noted also\u00a0 that these sections provide for an appeal only upon a judgment which <i>\"finally determines the acting or proceeding.\"<\/i>\u00a0 This phrase, <i>\"final judgment disposing of the action or proceeding\"<\/i> seems to be significant.\u00a0 The evident purpose of the legislature in using this phrase was to prevent (except in very extreme cases) appeals from an order, decree or judgment of the lower court which <i>disposed of only a part of the proceeding or action<\/i>.\u00a0 Appeals always mean delay in the final determination of causes.\u00a0 The\u00a0 majority of the United States Commission at the time these provisions of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions were enacted, were eminent lawyers and fully understood the delays caused by appeals and evidently intended that no appeal should be allowed in any cause from a judgment, order or decree of the lower court until <i>the cause was finally determined<\/i>.\u00a0 In the present case the plaintiff was attempting to seek (<i>a<\/i>) a divorce, and (<i>b<\/i>) a division of the conjugal property.\u00a0 The court granted the divorce.\u00a0 If an appeal should be allowed against that decree, then it would be useless to proceed to a division of the conjugal property until after the question whether or not the plaintiff was entitled to her divorce was settled on the appeal.\u00a0 And then suppose the Supreme Court should affirm the decree of the lower court and return the cause for further proceedings, and in settling the second question with reference to the division of the conjugal property, one or both of the parties might claim that an error was committed, they would then be entitled to another appeal against that order or decree of the lower court and have the case brought to this court again.\u00a0 Thus double time would be lost in the final settlement of the differences between the plaintiff and the defendant.\u00a0 And then again suppose that in one or the other of these appeals there existed questions upon which the parties might appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States; we would then have a further delay and the result of the whole case would remain suspended during the pendency of this appeal.<br\/><br\/>It might be argued, however, that the decree of the lower court in the present case was wrong; that the plaintiff was not entitled to her divorce and that it would be useless, therefore, to proceed to a division of the conjugal property.\u00a0 That might be admitted for the purpose of the argument; nevertheless it would seem clear that the decree of the court granting the divorce, without deciding the question as to the division of the conjugal property did not \"finally determine the action\" pending in the lower court.\u00a0 The lower court recognized this fact, to wit, that his decree did not finally determine all of the questions presented by the complaint in the\u00a0 lower court, by providing that\u00a0 a division of the conjugal property should constitute a part of the proceedings in that cause.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion and so hold that it was the purpose of the legislature in enacting the provisions of sections 123 and 143 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions to prohibit appeals except from decisions of the lower court which finally determine the action or proceeding.\u00a0 We fully recognize the fact, however, that there may be cases in which decrees or orders are made by the lower court which do not finally determine the action or proceeding, from which an appeal may be taken, but these cases must be such as will effectually prevent the parties to the action from protecting their rights in the further proceedings in the lower court, until the validity of such decree or order is finally settled on appeal.\u00a0 These exceptions, however, will be found to be very few.\u00a0 We will not now attempt to determine under what circumstances such appeals will be allowed.\u00a0 It is sufficient now to state the general rule.<br\/><br\/>The question as to when a decree is final is one which the courts have discussed many times and it is difficult to harmonize the numerous decisions of the various courts upon that question.\u00a0 Mr. Justice Brown, of the Supreme Court of the United States, speaking for the court, said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Probably no question of equity practice has been the subject of more frequent discussion in this court than the finality of decrees.\"\u00a0 (McGourkey <i>vs.<\/i> The Toledo &amp; Ohio Ry. Co., 146, U. S., 536, 544.)<\/blockquote><br\/>In the present case the court granted the plaintiff her divorce and appointed a commissioner for the purpose of making an inventory of the conjugal property.\u00a0 The commissioner had no authority to make a division of the property.\u00a0 His only duty was to make an inventory and report the same to the court when the final division in accordance with law would be made by the court.\u00a0 Nothing could be done in the actual division of the property without the intervention of the court and even after\u00a0 the court had made a decree dividing the property, if the parties were dissatisfied with such decree, they would have their right of appeal.\u00a0 This court has decided in the case of De la Rama <i>vs.<\/i> De la Rama (7 Phil. Rep., 745) that the proceeding for the division of the conjugal property was a proper proceeding in an action for divorce.<br\/><br\/>In discussing the question as to the finality of a decree, Mr. Justice Brown (146 U. S., 536, 545) laid down the following rule:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"It may be said in general that if the court make a decree fixing the rights and liabilities of the parties, and thereupon refer the case to a master for a ministerial purpose only, and no further proceedings in court are contemplated, the decree is final; but if it refer the case to him as a subordinate court and for a judicial purpose, as to state an account between the parties, upon which a further decree is to be entered, the decree is not final.\"\u00a0 (Mc-Gourkey <i>vs.<\/i> Toledo &amp; Ohio Ry. Co., 146 U. S., 536; Craig-head <i>vs.<\/i> Wilson, 59 U. S., 18 How., 199; Beebe <i>vs.<\/i> Russell, 60 U. S., 19 How., 283.)<\/blockquote><br\/>In the case of Perkins <i>vs.<\/i> Fourniquet (6 How., 206) the Circuit Court of the United States decreed that the complainants were entitled to two-sevenths of certain property, and referred the matter to a master to take an accounting of it.\u00a0 The decree was held not to be final.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Pulliam <i>vs.<\/i> Christian (6 How., 209, 47 U. S.) a decree setting aside a deed by a bankrupt, directing the trustees under the deed to deliver up to the assignee all the property in their hands, and directing an account to be taken of the proceeds and sales previously made, was also held not to be a final decree.\u00a0 (Keystone Manganese Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Martin, 132 U. S., 91; Lodge <i>vs.<\/i> Twell, 135 U. S., 232; Clark <i>vs.<\/i> Roller, 199 U. S., 541; Guarantee Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Mechanics' Bank, 173 U. S., 582; Araullo <i>vs.<\/i> Araullo, 3 Phil. Rep., 567; Toribio <i>vs.<\/i> Toribio, 7 Phil. Rep., 526; Ron <i>vs.<\/i> Mojica, 8 Phil. Rep., 328.)<br\/><br\/>Under all of the\u00a0 facts in the present case and the law applicable thereto, we are of the opinion and so hold that the defendant is not injured by denying1 him an appeal at this stage of the proceedings, and that he must wait until the commissioner who was appointed by the lower court makes his report and the same is finally acted upon by the court and until all of the matters in controversy between the parties are disposed of by final order.\u00a0 Upon an appeal from that decree, every matter in discussion will be open to the parties in this court and may all be heard at the same time.\u00a0 We think that this is the better doctrine to establish.<br\/><br\/>The bill of exceptions in the present case is dismissed with costs against the appellant.\u00a0 After the expiration of ten days let a judgment be entered in accordance herewith and the record remanded to the court from which it came for such further action as may be necessary to finally determine the questions involved in the cause.\u00a0 It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Carson, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Elliott, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/><center><b>DISSENTING OPINION<\/b><\/center><br\/>TORRES J.:<br\/><br\/>Save always the respect due to the majority opinion, the undersigned believes that it is his duty to state the reason why he does not concur with, and has not subscribed the foregoing decision.<br\/><br\/>The question involved in the motion presented by the plaintiff may be reduced to the following:\u00a0 Is a decision entered by the Court of First Instance in an action for divorce, granting a separation between the plaintiff and the defendant, and holding that the conjugal partnership formed between them has been dissolved from the date of the decision, a final one?\u00a0 Can the said decision be appealed from by means of a bill of exceptions, under the provisions of the Code of Procedure now in force?<br\/><br\/>We answer both questions in the affirmative and therefore, in our opinion, considering the provisions of section 123 of the Code of Civil Procedure, said motion does not lie, inasmuch as the decision above alluded to definitely puts an end to the contention between a badly mated husband and wife; it authorizes their legal separation, modifies to a certain extent their respective social status, and dissolves the conjugal partnership that they had formed by their marriage, together with the other consequences which under the law a final decree of divorce produces.<br\/><br\/>In order to wind up the said partnership the defendant was directed by the court to present an inventory comprising all the property described therein.\u00a0 Has the said mandate altered the final character of the judgment granting the divorce?\u00a0 Not at all.\u00a0 The latter part of the judgment will be executed after the first part has become final and susceptible of compliance.\u00a0 As long as no final decision granting the divorce has been rendered, the marital partnership can not be considered dissolved, nor can a separation of the property of the divorced couple be proceeded with.\u00a0 (Arts. 1433, 1434, and 1437, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The main object of an appeal interposed and admitted by means of a bill of exceptions is to obtain from the appellate court a reversal of the judgment appealed from, that is to say, that the divorce granted therein be\u00a0 overruled; and this notwithstanding the fact that the second part of the judgment is expressly involved in the decision affirming or reversing the same; in the decision, however, the only question to be considered is whether or not the granting of the divorce, which was the principal finding in said judgment, was in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>In our opinion it is not proper to discuss what property constitutes the <i>gananciales<\/i>, and what property was contributed by each spouse and the character and conditions thereof, until it shall have been determined by means of a final judgment that the separation of the partners and of their respective properties should be made.\u00a0 The said separation and division will be effected when there is no more discussion as to whether or not the divorce should be granted.\u00a0 The judgment on this very important question can not be supposed as rendered finally in order to decide at once how the conjugal partnership will be liquidated and how the property thereof will be divided between the partners.\u00a0 Such operations, which are of a secondary nature, can easily be performed upon the rendering of a final judgment granting the divorce which is the principal and only object of the action.<br\/><br\/>This action should be brought to a close by means of a decision granting or denying the prayer for divorce, not by a separation and division of the property of the divorced parties which only follows as a consequence of an affirmative finding in a petition for divorce.<br\/><br\/>Sections 181 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure, touching partition of real estate, are not applicable in this case.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing and of other considerations based on the law, in our opinion the motion above referred to should be overruled, and the appeal to this second instance should be prosecuted.<\/div>",

CARLOS PALANCA TAN-GUINLAY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.-GERMANN &amp; CO., LIMITED, APPELLEES.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>WILLARD, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">Some of the matters connected with this litigation have been examined by this court twice before.\u00a0 (Quiros <i>vs<\/i>. Tan-Guinlay, 5 Phil. Rep., 675; Palanca Tan-Guinlay <i>vs<\/i>. Quiros, 10 Phil. Rep., 360.)<br\/><br\/>On the 18th day of April, 1906, judgment was rendered in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila in favor of the plaintiff in this action and against the defendant Tan-Guinlay for 7,981.80 pesos, and interest from the 1st day of January, 1894.\u00a0 The plaintiff, claiming that Germann &amp; Co., Limited, were indebted to the defendant Tan-Guinlay in the amount of 7,741.17 pesos, with interest from the 1st day of January, 1894, took these proceedings for the purpose of having that debt applied in payment of its judgment against Tan-Guinlay.<br\/><br\/>We will not stop to inquire whether the practice adopted by the plaintiff is or is not authorized by the Code of Civil Procedure, but will pass directly to the merits of the case, which involve only one question, namely, whether in 1893 Germann &amp; Co. owed Tan-Guinlay the amount which the plaintiff claims they owed him, or any other amount.<br\/><br\/>Tan-Guinlay was not a witness in these proceedings.\u00a0 The person who was the manager of Germann &amp; Co. in 1893 long since ceased to be such manager and did not testify at the trial, nor did any persons so testify who were then connected with that concern.\u00a0 The evidence in the case practically consisted of the books of Germann &amp; Co. kept at that time and parts of the records of\" various proceedings in the litigation then had between Quiros, the present plaintiff, and Tan-Guinlay, and between Germann &amp; Co. and Tan-Guinlay.\u00a0 The books above mentioned show that Germann &amp; Co. not only did not owe Tan-Guinlay anything but that he owed them 7,358.83 pesos.\u00a0 It was also proven that Germann &amp; Co. then obtained judgment against Tan-Guinlay for that amount; that the judgment never was collected, and that it was charged off as loss upon the books of Germann &amp; Co.\u00a0 It seems to be admitted by the plaintiff and appellant that Tan-Guinlay did, in fact, owe Germann &amp; Co. this amount of 7,358.83 pesos.\u00a0 And the whole case of the plaintiff rests upon the proposition that Tan-Guinlay was entitled to credit upon that sum to the amount of 15,100 pesos, money paid by Tan-Guinlay, or on his account, to Germann &amp; Co.\u00a0 Deducting the admitted balance of 7,358.83 from this amount of 15,100 pesos, there is left 7,741.17 pesos, which is the amount claimed in these proceedings to be due from Germann &amp; Co. to Tan-Guinlay, with interest.<br\/><br\/>The evidence relating to this sum of 15,100 pesos is as follows; On the 5th day of December, 1893, the plaintiff Quiros commenced an action against Tan-Guinlay, in which action all the property of Tan-Guinlay in his store in Calle Rosario, in Binondo, was attached, including all his books, papers, and documents.\u00a0 Among the papers thus seized were seven documents-two promissory notes and five bills of exchange.\u00a0 These bills of exchange were all substantially of the same kind and number; 423 (4148) will serve as an example of the rest.\u00a0 It is a bill of exchange drawn at Calibo on the 7th of September, 1893, for 5,150 pesos, signed by Chiu-Ponso to the order of Chua-Seongco, drawn upon Tan-Tuco, and accepted by him payable on the 17th of October, 1893.\u00a0 The following names appear upon the back in this order:\u00a0 Chua-Seongco, C. Tan-Guinlay, and under them these words:\u00a0 \"Recibimos, Germann y Ca.\"\u00a0 It also bears a rubber stamp which reads, \"Germann &amp; Co., Manila.\"<br\/><br\/>The two promissory notes were signed by persons other than Tan-Guinlay and Germann &amp; Co., and were not payable to either of them, though both bore the name of Tan-Guinlay upon the back and the words, \"Recibimos, Germann &amp; Co.\"<br\/><br\/>It will be observed that Tan-Guinlay was not the person who was ultimately bound to pay these obligations.\u00a0 That person, so far as the bills of exchange are concerned, was Tan-Tuco, and Tan-Guinlay was only an indorser.<br\/><br\/>The only thing that appears in connection with these documents, is the bare fact that they were found among the papers of Tan-Guinlay when the attachment above-mentioned was levied; that they were then taken possession of by a receiver, were introduced in evidence in a criminal case against Tan-Guinlay and the manager of Germann &amp; Co. in 1895, and have been since that time in the records of the Court of First Instance of Manila, and at the present trial were presented as a part of that record.<br\/><br\/>The theory of the plaintiff, however, is that Germann &amp; Co. received by reason of these documents 15,100 pesos in cash from someone on account of Tan-Guinlay and that 7,358.83 pesos of the amount was applied in payment of the debt then due from Tan-Guinlay to Germann &amp; Co., leaving a balance of 7,741.17 pesos still due from Germann &amp; Co. to Tan-Guinlay.\u00a0 There is no direct evidence to show these facts.<br\/><br\/>It seems apparent that these documents were at one time in the possession of Tan-Guinlay, and that they were afterwards delivered by Tan-Guinlay to Germann &amp; Co., who later redelivered them to Tan-Guinlay.\u00a0 The books of Germann &amp; Co., kept at the time, were examined at the trial of this proceeding and they contained no entry whatever relating to these papers.\u00a0 There was no entry in any of the books showing that any money had ever been received by Germann &amp; Co. on account thereof, either from Tan-Guinlay or Tan-Tuco or the other persons ultimately bound to pay them.\u00a0 That the obligations were never paid by Tan-Tuco is clearly proven by the fact that the papers were found in the office of Tan-Guinlay, an indorser.\u00a0 If they had been paid by Tan-Tuco to Germann &amp; Co., the latter would have delivered the documents to Tan-Tuco and they would be in his possession and not in the possession of Tan-Guinlay.\u00a0 It is also apparent that the obligations were never paid by any other of the persons primarily responsible thereon, for the reason that they are now found in the possession of Tan-Guinlay, one of the indorsers.\u00a0 Not only were they never paid by any of the parties thus responsible, but it is very evident that they never will be paid and are worthless.<br\/><br\/>Germann &amp; Co. not having received this amount of 15,100 pesos from the makers and acceptors, they must have received it from Tan-Guinlay if they received it at all.\u00a0 If the theory is that when Germann &amp; Co. returned the notes they demanded that Tan-Guinlay pay them the amount of their bill, and he did make that payment, the plaintiff is in no way aided because Tan-Guinlay would have paid only what he owed and no money belonging to him would have been left in the hands of Germann &amp; Co.\u00a0 The theory must be that when they returned the notes, Germann &amp; Co. demanded not only payment for their bill but the balance of the 15,100 pesos, to wit, 7,741.17 pesos.\u00a0 This theory must rest on the claim that Germann &amp; Co., when receiving the bills, actually paid that amount in cash for them.<br\/><br\/>There is no evidence to support this theory and it is inherently improbable when it is considered that Germann &amp; Co. were only interested in securing the payment of their debt of 7,358.83 pesos, for which two of the bills-No. 4119 for 3,000 pesos, and No. 4148 for 5,150 pesos-would more than have sufficed, and no reason is shown why they should have desired to purchase and pay cash for the five other bills, which were then of so little value that they were not considered worth protesting.<br\/><br\/>The only reasonable theory is that these documents were delivered by Tan-Guinlay to Germann &amp; Co. with the understanding that whatever amount was collected by them should be credited on his account, and nothing having been collected, they were all returned to him.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff relies to a great extent upon an opinion given on the 19th of October, 1896, by two expert bookkeepers, who were appointed by the Court of First Instance of Binondo to examine the books and accounts of Germann &amp; Co.\u00a0 These experts were appointed in a criminal action for <i>estafa<\/i> which had been instituted by the plaintiff against Tan-Guinlay and the then manager of Germann &amp; Co.\u00a0 They reported the facts which have been set forth above in regard to the notes amounting to 15,100 pesos, held that, under the circumstances, Germann &amp; Co. should be charged with the amount of these notes, and that therefore they owed Tan-Guinlay 7,741.17 pesos.\u00a0 Two other experts appointed in the same proceeding made a similar report on the 22d of March, 1898.\u00a0 These reports amounted to nothing more than the legal opinion of the experts as to the liability of Germann &amp; Co. for the amount of these notes and bills of exchange and as such can not be considered as evidence of any facts.\u00a0 In the report of the first two experts, it is stated that Germann &amp; Co. recognized that these notes and bills had been paid by Tan-Guinlay.<br\/><br\/>Nothing is said upon this subject in the report of the second experts, one of whom was a witness at the trial of this proceeding.\u00a0 He testified that the then manager of Germann &amp; Co. was not informed by the experts of the results of the investigation and that they had no communication with him.\u00a0 These experts were appointed to examine the books of Germann &amp; Co. Their faculties were limited to a report of what appeared from the books and anything inserted in the report relating to statements made by the then manager of Germann &amp; Co. would be purely hearsay.\u00a0 None of the first board of experts was examined as a witness in this proceeding.\u00a0 It follows, therefore, that even if these reports, made in another proceeding to which Germann &amp; Co. were not parties, could in any way be considered evidence in this case, they can not vary the result which necessarily follows from the other evidence presented.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff not having proved that Germann &amp; Co. are indebted to Tan-Guinlay in any amount, the judgment of the court below must be sustained.\u00a0 It is accordingly affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

LEONA ARBADO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 30th day of June, 1906, Silvestra Lubrico, by her attorney at law, brought an action against Leona Arbado for recovery of possession, praying that the defendant be ordered to return to the plaintiff 18 hectares of land, the property of said plaintiff, as being an integral part of 70 hectares, 50 ares, and 47 centares of land which belonged to her father, Guillermo Lubrico, as shown by a deed of ownership issued in favor of the latter.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff further demanded that the defendant be obliged to restore to her the fruits collected, amounting to 1,500 <i>cavanes<\/i> of unhusked rice, at the rate of 500 <i>cavanes<\/i> per annum, in addition to the pending crop, the corresponding damages, and costs.<br\/><br\/>In support of her contention she alleged that she is the only general heir of her deceased parents, Guillermo Lubrico and Venancia Jaro, who left her the said land, situated in Camansi, barrio of Castellana in the municipality of Pontevedra, Occidental Negros.\u00a0 The property is bounded on the north by land formerly belonging to Pedro Camon and now to Felix Robles; on the east by the land of the heirs of Mariano Arteca, now pertaining to Balbino Lacson, and by that of Clara Luna, now the property of Hermogenes Traspicio; on the south by the land of Marcos Montafio and Isidro Esteves, which has been transferred to the Chinaman Chiua; and on the west by the River Camansi, the Mansalagao Creek, and the land of Margarita Velez.\u00a0 That the herein-described land was the property and in the possession of her father, by virtue of the title deed No. 4402, issued July 2, 1888, by the <i>Direccion Civil<\/i>, and duly inscribed in the registry of property on June 20, 1906; that notwithstanding these facts, the defendant, Leona Arbado, three years ago appropriated a tract of about 18 hectares of said land on the east side bordering the land of Clara Luna (formerly of the heirs of Mariano Arteca), the unlawful detainer taking possession of almost one-fourth of the land of the plaintiff on the east side in a straight line from north to south, approximating 18 hectares; that for three years the defendant has had the usufruct of the said portion of land, annually collecting therefrom a crop of not less than 500 <i>cavanes<\/i> without allowing the plaintiff any participation therein, notwithstanding the fact that she is the hereditary owner, and that in order to avoid litigation and consequent trouble the plaintiff requested the defendant, in a friendly manner, to return the land unlawfully appropriated by her together with the fruits therefrom, but that Leona Arbado refused to make such restitution.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, Leona Arbado, Mas cited to appear and served with a copy of the complaint.\u00a0 Her demurrer to the preceding complaint was overruled, whereupon on the 15th of September, 1906, she presented a written answer denying each and every allegation contained in the complaint, and, as a special defense, set forth that she, the defendant, was the owner of the land claimed, and that she had held possession thereof for more than forty-three years, counting the time the land was held by her antecessor; she therefore prayed that the complaint be dismissed with costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The documents offered in evidence by the plaintiff were made of record, and without any proof being adduced by the defendant the court below rendered judgment on the 16th of January, 1907, absolving the defendant, Leona Arbado, with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The latter excepted to the foregoing judgment as soon as she was notified of it, and, on the same date, January 17, 1907, presented a written motion for a new trial in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 190, on the ground that the said decision was not in accord with the weight of the evidence, inasmuch as she, having proven her ownership of the land, of which that portion which the defendant claimed to have been in possession of for more than forty-three years formed an integral part, it devolved upon the defendant to prove the alleged possession, in order to counteract her ownership, evidenced as it was by documentary proof; that after the trial was new evidence was discovered of which the plaintiff had no knowledge, and which she could not have discovered during the trial even by the exercise of the greatest diligence, as she was sick and absent from the capital; that it had been impossible for her to offer further proofs than the documentary evidence already presented; she therefore submitted affidavits regarding the facts mentioned.\u00a0 The motion was overruled on the 25th of January, 1907; the plaintiff excepted and presented the corresponding bill of exceptions, which was approved and submitted to this court.<br\/><br\/>The question at issue in this action is the recovery of a parcel of land with an area of about 18 hectares alleged to have been owned by the plaintiff and retained by the defendant for more than three years prior to the date of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 2 of article 348 of the Civil Code provides that-<br\/><blockquote>\"The owner has a right of action against the holder and the possessor of the thing to recover the same.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is an incontrovertible principle of law that, in order that an action to recover may be successfully prosecuted, it is necessary to identify the thing claimed, and to verify the claimant's right of dominion.\u00a0 This is established by various decisions, among others, those of May 18, 1866, December 30, 1881, and May 10, 1895, which already constitute the rule of courts.<br\/><br\/>It has been fully proven in the record, by means of documentary evidence, that Guillermo Lubrico, deceased, and his wife, were the owners of a parcel of land of 70 hectares, 50 ares, and 47 centares, situated in Camansi, in the town of Pontevedra, and whose area and boundaries are set out in the title by \"composition\" with the Government issued in his favor by the<i> Direccion Civil<\/i> on July 2, 1888, in the time of the former sovereignty, and duly registered on the 20th of June, 1906.\u00a0 It also appears to have been fully proven, by the same kind of evidence, that the plaintiff is the legitimate daughter of the said Guillermo Lubrico and Ignacia or Venancia Jaro; that the latter were lawfully married, and are now deceased.<br\/><br\/>These facts, as well as that the 18 hectares of land claimed in the complaint form a part of the larger tract situated in Camansi, in the town of Pontevedra, to which the said title refers, and the fact that the defendant is now in material possession of the said parcel of 18 hectares, have not been disputed; on the contrary, they have been admitted in this litigation.<br\/><br\/>The detention of the said land by the defendant, Leona Arbado, being alleged in the complaint and denied by the latter, with the averment that she has possessed, and still possesses, the same as owner for more than forty-three years, including the time her ancestor was in possession, it is unquestionable that the land claimed by the plaintiff, also as owner, is actually in the possession of the defendant, as asserted by the latter, and that it has so been for forty-three years; hence, the property is clearly identified, and the plaintiff is not under the necessity, other than by her allegation, of proving the detention or occupation, already admitted by the defendant, nor the period of the usurpation.\u00a0 This latter detail is of no importance for the decision of the contention, inasmuch as the person detaining the property admits the possession of the land claimed for a much longer period.<br\/><br\/>When each of the contending parties alleges his right of ownership to certain property, in order to decide the question it is sufficient to ascertain and determine which of the two holds title of ownership.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, Silvestra Lubrico, in due course presented her title to the land which she inherited from her parents, of which the parcel of 18 hectares that the defendant alleges she possesses as owner forms an integral portion; but the latter has not produced her title, nor has she proven her right of dominion over the said parcel of land, nor in what manner her ancestor acquired it, and, what is even worse, the said defendant has not proven that she possessed the land as the owner thereof for the number of years that she claims.<br\/><br\/>If in order to be respected in the possession of a thing mere possession is sufficient, unless a better right be established by another person, yet from the time when it is shown that such possession is unlawful and to the prejudice of the real owner who has established his claim by means of a lawful title, the property usurped must, in justice, be forthwith restored to the true owner.<br\/><br\/>An action of recovery is a right pertaining to the owner, the ownership being duly proven, and lies against any person in possession who, without title, unlawfully detains the property of the plaintiff.\u00a0 (Puruganan <i>vs<\/i>. Martin, No. 3616, 8 Phil. Rep., 519.)<br\/><br\/>If in her answer thB defendant had limited herself to denying the facts alleged in the complaint, the duty to prove them would have devolved upon the plaintiff; but since the said defendant has alleged as a special defense that she is the owner of the 18 hectares of land which is the subject of the complaint, and that, including the time that her ancestor was in possession, she was in possession thereof for more than forty-three years, she can not evade her obligation to prove her ownership and the lengthy possession that she alleges, inasmuch as ownership supposes, possession on the part of the owner unles it be proven that another is in possession of the property, as happens in the present case, in which the defendant, Arbado, possesses the parcel of land in question without lawful right.<br\/><br\/>It is alleged in the complaint that the plaintiff, Silvestra Lubrico, is an only child, and therefore the sole general heir of the original owners of the property, and no proof was offered at the trial to show that there was any other descendant entitled to succeed besides the plaintiff, who, on her part, has shown herself to be the legitimate daughter of the late Guillermo Lubrico and Venancia Jaro.<br\/><br\/>If heirs succeed the deceased by their own right and operation of law in all his rights and obligations by the mere fact of his death, it is unquestionable that the plaintiff, in fact and in law, succeeded her parents and acquired the ownership of the land referred to in the said title, by the mere fact of their death.\u00a0 (Arts. 440, 657, 658, 659, and 661, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Even in the event that there should be a coheir or a coowner of the parcel of land in question, once the right of the plaintiff, and consequently her personality, has been proven, the defendant has no right to dispute them, because she is not a coheir nor a coowner of the property, nor does it appear that she ever had any right to the land, she being a mere usurper thereof.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the proceeds that the defendant has collected from the land and the loss and damages suffered by the plaintiff in consequence of the detention, no evidence has been offered as to their value or extent, therefore, upon ordering the restoration of the detained land, it is not possible to direct the corresponding restitution of the fruits or any indemnity for their value.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, and in view of the fact that the judgment appealed from is not in accordance with the law, it is our opinion that the same should be reversed, and that Leona Arbado be, and is hereby, sentenced to restore to Silvestra Lubrico the parcel of land of 18 hectares claimed in the complaint, without any special ruling as to the costs in either instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano., C.

to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P150 monthly for their maintenance, and the costs, in addition to any further relief to which in the opinion of the court the plaintiff and her children might be entitled.\u00a0 She alleged that from December, 1895, to March, 1902, she and Edmundo Ullmann lived together as man and wife; that both were single at the time, and there was nothing to hinder marriage between them; that from this union there were had two children, the elder of which was born on the 4th of September, 1896, and was baptized under the name of Carlos, in the parish church of Intramuros, and the latter was born on the 23d of April, 1900, and baptized under the name of Elvira, in the parish church of Quiapo; that the said children, from the time of their respective births until March, 1902, continuously enjoyed the status of natural children of the defendant, and the latter constantly provided for their maintenance and furnished their necessities; that the defendant owns sufficient property to be able to contribute P150 monthly toward the support of the said children, while on the other hand the plaintiff lacks the means to provide for them.\u00a0 The defendant, through his counsel, filed a written answer on the 23d of the said month and year, praying that he be absolved from the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff, and that he be granted any other proper relief.\u00a0 To this effect he set forth that as to the first allegation of the complaint, he neither admitted nor denied it, for the reason that he had no exact information with regard to it; as to the second, third, and fourth allegations, he offered a general and specific denial, to each and every part thereof.<br\/><br\/>The case was duly tried and the documents offered in evidence by the plaintiff were made of record.\u00a0 On the 30th of April, 1908, the court below rendered judgment in the case and sentenced the defendant to recognize Carlos and Elvira as his natural children, and to allow the plaintiff, in whose company they live the sum of P40 monthly for their maintenance, and to pay the costs.\u00a0 The \"defendant excepted to the above judgment and moved for new trial on the ground that it was contrary to the weight of the evidence; his motion was overruled, to which the petitioner excepted, and in due course the corresponding bill of exceptions was presented, and afterwards submitted to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The matter at issue is the recognition of two natural children born to two persons who at the time of the conception\u00a0 of the said children were free to marry.\u00a0 The recognition was claimed by the mother from the defendant father of the children in view of the fact that they had continuously enjoyed the status of natural children of the said defendant; claim was also made for provision for the maintenance of the said children as a consequence of the recognition sought.<br\/><br\/>As may be seen, the court below considered as proven certain facts which conclusively demonstrate that the children Carlos and Elvira had continuously enjoyed the status of natural children of the defendant Edmundo Ullmann; this appreciation of the result of the proofs submitted in the case is in accordance with the merits and the law.<br\/><br\/>In effect, it.has been clearly proven in the case that the plaintiff, Juana Dizon, and the defendant, Edmundo Ullmann, were single persons, and free to contract marriage; that from the year 1895 until March, 1902, they lived together as man and wife in a house rented by the defendant and properly furnished by the man, except during the hours when he was engaged in the mercantile store of which he was a partner, and during the months when he was absent in Europe and other foreign places; and that in consequence and by reason of their living together in the same house during the said seven years and odd months, the plaintiff gave birth to four children, two of which died at a tender age and the other two are living.\u00a0 By the respective certificates of baptism offered in evidence at the trial the eldest was born on the 4th of September, 1896, and baptized under the name of Carlos, natural son of Juana Dizon and an unknown father; the younger was born on the 23d of October, 1900, and baptized by the name of Elvira, the natural daughter of Juana Dizon and an unknown father.<br\/><br\/>Since the year 1895, when the plaintiff and the defendant commenced to live together as man and wife, in the same house, with the children that they commenced to have from the following year, 1896, the said defendant has provided for the maintenance of the plaintiff as the mother of said children, and also for the latter; he paid the rental of the several houses that they successively occupied in Calle Arlegui, Tanduay, and in Calle Quiotan, Santa Cruz.\u00a0 On leaving this city to go to Paris, he left with the plaintiff, for the needs of herself and the said two children, some money, three carromatas and six horses for hire, so that the said mother and children might live with the returns from the said vehicles.<br\/><br\/>The defendant acknowledged under oath that he had paid all the expenses for the keeping of the\u00a0 aforesaid children Carlos and Elvira, the children of Juana Dizon, who he said was his mistress, from the time they were born until his departure from Manila in 1902;\u00a0 he added that, in order to maintain the said children and the plaintiff, he was obliged to spend not less than 26,000 to 28,000 pesos, and that when he left in that year, he gave them the vehicles and six horses above referred to in order that they might support themselves with the 150 pesos that the rental thereof produced.<br\/><br\/>Article 135 of the Civil Code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The father is obliged to\u00a0 acknowledge the natural child * * *<br\/><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 When the child is in uninterrupted enjoyment of the status of a natural child of the defendant father, justified by direct acts of the said father * * *.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The doctrine established by the supreme court of Spain, among other decisions in that of November 7, 1896, is of the following tenor:<br\/><blockquote>\"The enjoyment of the status to which said article 135 refers, must necessarily be revealed by acts clearly showing the will of the father or, in certain cases, of his family, to recognize as his natural child him who claims compulsory recognition, by keeping him in his house, supporting and educating him as such, or by other similar acts of equal value and efficiency, showing that under the said character the child maintains constant relations with the author of his days, or with his family.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>From the conduct of the defendant Ullmann since 1896 when the boy Carlos was born, until the year 1902 at which time he left this city, and long afterwards while he was in Paris, from which city he wrote various letters to the plaintiff and her two children, in which he expressed his tender affection, and charged the mother to\u00a0 care for the children, averring that he was anxious in regard to her health and that of the children, it is logically and unquestionably inferred that the said Carlos and Elvira continuously enjoyed the status of natural children of the defendant father, plainly shown by the behaviour and the manifest and direct acts of the father himself.<br\/><br\/>The following facts are proven:\u00a0 that the defendant kept the children Carlos and Elvira in the various houses that he rented as dwellings from the time they were born; that one day he asked his neighbor, Rafael Enriquez, to stand as godfather at the christening of the girl Elvira, which Enriquez did, and the father gave him his own carriage for the purpose; that he paid for the maintenance of the said two children, and attended to all their needs as well as of the mother for almost seven years, prior to abandoning them in this city.\u00a0 For all of which the said Enriquez always thought and believed that the said children were the issue of the contending parties, seeing that the latter lived together in the same house as husband and wife with the children and treated them as their own; and it is natural that Carlos and Elvira should be considered by the public as the children of both,\u00a0 because if such was the opinion formed by the godfather, Enriquez, it is not to be wondered that other residents of the place, and everyone who knew them acquired the conviction that the said children were the issue of the defendant Ullmann by the plaintiff Dizon, and as such they continuously enjoyed the status of\u00a0 natural children of their known natural father, in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing and of the considerations contained in the judgment appealed from, it is our opinion that the same should be and it is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Willard, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

examination of the record it appears that on or about the 1st day of August, 1905, the plaintiff and defendant entered into a contract by which the latter was to construct a house, for the former and to complete the same within a period of four months after the contract was signed and delivered.\u00a0 The construction of the house was actually commenced.\u00a0 The plaintiff made some changes in and additions to the original plans of the house, which changes were agreed to by the defendant, and a new contract was made relating thereto.\u00a0 It appears that the defendant was prevented from continuing his work upon the house for the reason that the plaintiff had not secured a proper permit to make the additions from the authorities of the city of Manila.\u00a0 By reason of the failure of the plaintiff to obtain a permit to make the said changes and additions, the defendant was delayed for several weeks.\u00a0 For the construction of the house the plaintiff had furnished several pieces of timber, alleged to be worth P132.\u00a0 The defendant proved that he had expended in labor and money upon the additions made to the house the sum of P500.\u00a0 Under the first agreement the plaintiff was to make four equal payments for the construction of the house, each payment to be made when the house was in a certain state of completion.\u00a0 The evidence is very conflicting with reference to the state of completion at the time when the present differences arose between the parties.\u00a0 The evidence, however, sustains one fact beyond question, and that is that it had certainly passed the state of completion when the plaintiff was to make the first payment upon the original contract.\u00a0 The plaintiff does not allege nor attempt to prove that he made any payments whatever upon the original contract, nor any payments whatever upon the second contract for the additions to the original building.<br\/><br\/>The defendant alleges and proves that by reason of the fact that the plaintiff failed to make the payments in accordance with the terms of the contract, that he was unable to proceed with the construction of the house.\u00a0 The plaintiff attempted to prove that the material used by the defendant in the construction of the house was not of the class which he contracted to furnish.\u00a0 The defendant's witnesses all testified that the material was of the kind and character contracted to be supplied.\u00a0 Finally the house was totally destroyed by a <i>baguio<\/i> before its completion.\u00a0 On the 19th of December, 1906, the plaintiff commenced the present action for the purpose of recovering of the defendant the sum of P132, the value of the said pieces of material furnished by him to the defendant, and the sum of P600 damages for failure of the defendant to complete the house within the period of four months provided for in the first contract.\u00a0 The defendant answered the said complaint, denied really all of the material allegations of the complaint, set out the original contract, alleged the new contract and the fact that the plaintiff had refused to make payments in accordance with the terms of the contract, and asked for a judgment against the plaintiff in the sum of P1,928.56.<br\/><br\/>The lower court, after hearing the evidence, found as a matter of fact that each of the parties had more or less failed to comply with his respective obligation, and\u00a0 said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"It is greatly to be regretted that the parties can not adjust their difficulties amicably.\u00a0 The condition in which both must be left as a result of this judgment, which appears to be the only one justified by the evidence, can hardly be satisfactory to either.\u00a0 The plaintiff will not have his building and the defendant, although he seems to have expended considerable for labor and material, will not receive his contract price.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>Thus the lower court balances the failure of one of the parties to comply with his terms of the contract with the failure of the other to comply with his part of the original contract, and refused to allow either one a judgment.<br\/><br\/>The lower court further found that inasmuch as the plaintiff had actually furnished material to the defendant in the sum of P132, which the defendant had used, that he (the plaintiff) was entitled to a judgment for that amount.<br\/><br\/>The lower court further found that inasmuch as the defendant had expended in labor and material the sum of P500 for additional\u00a0 work and labor performed upon the additions made to the original building, at the request of the plaintiff, that he (the defendant) was entitled to a judgment against the plaintiff for that sum.<br\/><br\/>The conclusion of the lower court was, therefore, that the defendant recover of the plaintiff the sum of P368, being the difference between P500 and P132.<br\/><br\/>From this judgment of the lower court the plaintiff appealed, basing his appeal upon the provisions of articles 1124 and 1591 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>It seems to us that the judgment of the lower court being based purely upon a question of fact, it should be affirmed, and without any finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/>The appellant claims that the lower court committed an error in not deciding that each of the parties was absolved from any further liability under the said contract, by virtue of the provisions of article 1124 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 Upon this question we are of the opinion and so hold that while the court did not expressly pronounce that the parties were absolved from any further obligation upon the contract, yet, by the very terms of the judgment the said parties must necessarily be absolved from any further action or liability upon the said contract.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that the plaintiff did not perform the undertaking which he was bound by the terms of his agreement to perform; consequently he is not entitled to insist upon the performance of the contract by the defendant or to recover damages by reason of his own breach.\u00a0 We think the judgment of the lower court absolved each party from any further liability upon the said contract.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff alleges that the lower court committed an error in not making\u00a0 the defendant, the contractor of the building which was destroyed, liable for the loss and damage which he suffered by such destruction.\u00a0 The building was destroyed by a <i>baguio<\/i>.\u00a0 The proof is not sufficient to show that the destruction was due to defects in the construction of the building, and until that fact had been established, certainly the plaintiff would not be entitled to damages under the said article, (Cf. Choy <i>vs.<\/i> Heredia, 12 Phil. Rep., 259.)<br\/><br\/>Under all of the evidence adduced in the trial of the case in the lower court, we are of the opinion and so hold that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, and without any finding as to costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

D. 20504, averring that by the acceptance of the lines\u00a0 contained in the plan, there is included an extension of 15 square meters of Calle Velazquez, which belongs to the public domain.\u00a0 The city of Manila also joins in the\u00a0 opposition of the Insular Government.<br\/><br\/>\"The petitioner contends that his plan is correct, and that the parcels claimed by both parties opponent are integral parts of his land comprised within the plan.<br\/><br\/>\"Under a public instrument executed on December 20, 1872, before Francisco R. Avellana, then a notary public of this city, a copy of which, Exhibit B, issued by M. de Iriarte, chief of the division of archives, on September 17, last year, is attached to the record, Fray Antonio Fermentino, the then <i>procurador general<\/i> of the Augustinian fathers of this city, sold two adjoining lots to the brothers Atanasio and Moises Buzon, both parcels being located in the barrio of Caleros, within the jurisdiction of the district of Tondo, the metes and bounds of which parcels are shown in said document.<br\/><br\/>\"At the death of one of the purchasers, Atanasio Buzon, his two surviving daughters, Serapia Buzon by the first marriage, and Apolonia Buzon of the second marriage, together with his only three granddaughters, Severina, Maria, and Victoria Buzon, issue of his deceased son Diego Buzon, succeeded him in all his rights and actions as his only heirs.\u00a0 These five heirs of Atanasio Buzon sold to the petitioner their interest in the land as the only heirs of Atanasio Buzon, as appears by parol evidence shown in Exhibit E, the two last named, Maria and Victoria Buzon, being represented by their mother Brigida de la Cruz, on account of being minors.\u00a0 The necessity and advisability of the sale of the interest of the two minors, Maria and Victoria Buzon, was duly shown.<br\/><br\/>\"At the death of the other purchaser, Moises Buzon, his widow Anselma Feliz, by whom he had but one son, also named Moises Buzon, sold the part of the property corresponding to the first named to Leon Buzon, as appears in a public instrument executed on January 27, 1879, before Alejandro Casal, then one of the notaries public of this city, a copy of which was issued on November 12 of last year by M. Iriarte, chief of the division of archives, and is attached to the record L. D. 17953.\u00a0 Moises Buzon, who, as appears from the oral evidence is the only heir of his father, Moises Buzon, being of legal age, agreed to the sale made by his mother, Anselma Felix.<br\/><br\/>\"On the death of Leon Buzon, his only son, Lucio Buzon, succeeded him and brought a possessory action before one of the Courts of First Instance of this city, and inscribed the possession shown in the former registry of property of that portion of land adjudged to Moises Buzon.<br\/><br\/>\"From the foregoing facts, fully proven by documentary and oral evidence, it is to be inferred that the two contiguous parcels acquired from the Augustinian fathers were joined together and\u00a0 divided\u00a0 between the brothers Atanasio and Moises Buzon, and, after their death, and after successive and legal transfers, the two portions in which it was divided came into the possession of the applicant, Lucio Buzon, who joined them in one parcel, which is described in the application as follows:\u00a0 Bounded on the east or in front by Calle Velazquez; on the west or on the back by Manila Bay; on the north or the right side on entering, by Calle Pavia; and on the south or the left side on entering, by the land of Isidora Cristobal.\u00a0 The front toward Calle Velazquez is a broken or zigzag line composed of two straight lines, one of them 41.50 meters, and the other 52.80 meters in length, that is, a total of 93.80 meters; the rear measures 95.20 meters, and the right and left sides 23.77 meters, respectively.<br\/><br\/>\"The description contained in the public document of December 20, 1872, executed by the <i>procurador<\/i> of the Augustinian fathers in favor of Atanasio and Moises Buzon, attributes a greater extension than that assigned to each one of the sides forming the said plan.\u00a0 The east side of the two adjoining lots measures 165 <i>varas<\/i>, which is equivalent to 137.90 meters; the west side toward Manila Bay measures 149 <i>varas<\/i>, equivalent to 124.60 meters; the south and north sides are 32 <i>varas<\/i> in length, equivalent to 26.75 meters, and 31 <i>varas<\/i>, or 25.91 meters, respectively.<br\/><br\/>\"As is seen at a glance, the present measurements of the property have suffered a reduction.\u00a0 It can not be averred that the plan embraces a larger portion of land\u00a0 than that described in the instrument of December 20,\u00a0 1872.<br\/><br\/>\"If we heed the parol evidence, we find that the seashore was formerly about one hundred <i>brazas<\/i> distant from the land in question; that, in the course of time, and by the removal of a considerable quantity of sand from the shore at the back of the land for the use of the street car company in filling in Calle Cervantes, the sea water in ordinary tides now covers part of the land described in the petition.<br\/><br\/>\"The fact that certain land, not the bed of a river or of the sea, is covered by sea water during the period of ordinary high tide, is not a reason established by any law to cause the loss thereof, especially when, as in the present case, it becomes covered by water owing to circumstances entirely independent of the will of the owner.<br\/><br\/>\"It is notorious and of public knowledge that in Tondo, where the property in question is located, the sea waters as years elapse, are gradually encroaching on the lands of private ownership adjoining the bay to such an extent that many of the owners of the lands therein situated\u00a0 have lost a considerable portion of them on account of their becoming covered by the sea waters even during low tides.<br\/><br\/>\"The land in question is that which was acquired from the Augustinian fathers on December 20, 1872.\u00a0 Its superficial extension not only has not increased, but on the contrary, has been actually reduced, as appears from the comparison made of the survey evidenced\u00a0 by the deed, Exhibit B, and that which appears on the plan.<br\/><br\/>\"There is no legal reason, or any other ground, to justify the pretension of the Insular Government and of the city of Manila to consider that portion of land which becomes covered by water on the days and hours of usual tide, as public domain, it being, as it actually is, susceptible of being used for building purposes.<br\/><br\/>\"Owing to the topographical situation of the city of Manila, some lands are higher than others, according to the districts wherein they are located.\u00a0 They can be recognized at a glance.\u00a0 Even within a single district, the same thing happens, according to the location of the lands and the resources of their owners.\u00a0 Hence the constant and almost daily labor of certain employees of the city in the filling of many streets, in order to raise the level thereof and render them inaccessible during high tide to the sea water surrounding the city.\u00a0 However, there are still many streets which become, if not totally, at least partially inundated during the night tides of this month, and during the day tides of May, June, and July, for example.\u00a0 As eloquent proof of the above statements, certain streets of the districts of Trozo, Tondo, and Sampaloc, within the knowledge of the writer, can be cited.\u00a0 If this happens in the streets which are constantly being repaired and attended to by the city with the large resources at its command, it is needless to say what would happen to the low lands, many of which are below the street level, and whose owners are without the means to raise them.<br\/><br\/>\"The owners of lands situated in Tondo and adjoining Manila Bay are unfortunate enough by having to suffer the disastrous effects of the action of the sea, caused by the southeast monsoons, and by being exposed to the total loss of their lands on account of the phenomenon observed along the Tondo shore, where the sea, instead of depositing land formed by the action of the water, as happens in other places, gradually wears away that already existing and which adjoins the bay.<br\/><br\/>\"If the theory of the Insular Government and the city of Manila were to be accepted, unsupported as it is by any law, it would be an additional misfortune for property owners, who would become deprived of their lands.<br\/><br\/>\"The circumstance of the land in question belonging to a private person who aims to conserve it at his own expense, and takes the risk of its total disappearance, far from being a prejudice, is an advantage so far as the improvement of the city is concerned, and benefits the opposing entities themselves, inasmuch as the owner, if he persists in his desire to conserve the land, will employ the necessary means to prevent the flooding thereof and will raise the level and build retaining walls along the side facing Manila Bay, as has been done in various places in the districts of Ermita and Malate.<br\/><br\/>\"In other countries, as America, Japan, and the neighboring colony of Hongkong, the policy of the various governments is to reclaim lands from the inexhaustible store of the sea, either by their own initiative, or by that of private persons owning or not owning lands adjacent to the sea, for the purpose of extending their territory and to meet the requirements of a population daily increasing in numbers.\u00a0 But a radically different policy is adopted in the oppositions filed by the Insular Government and the city of Manila, a policy which tends to infringe on the sacred rights of private ownership, and in nothing benefits the interests of the Government itself or of the inhabitants of the country.<br\/><br\/>\"The city of Manila has presented no proof to\u00a0 show the equity of its claim.\u00a0 Its opposition, as well as that of the Insular Government, lacks foundation, and is overruled.<br\/><br\/>\"It having been duly proven by the evidence that the petitioner has acquired the ownership of the property described in the petition by virtue of the possession he enjoys, computing his possession, with that of his predecessors, from December 22,1872, the date of the document Exhibit B (an extraordinary prescription of 30 years), it is hereby decreed that, after general declaration\u00a0 of default, the property be adjudged to and registered in the name of Lucio Buzon y Javier.<br\/><br\/>\"After this decision becomes final, let the decree be issued, and let the register of deeds of the city of Manila cancel the entry of registration of possession standing in the

In Exhibit 1 there is an item crediting him with this amount, but later on in the same exhibit the same amount is charged to him, so that when Exhibit 1 was delivered to the defendant for his examination It did not appear that he had, in fact, been credited with this delivery.\u00a0 The double entry of this amount upon Exhibit 1 is explained by the witnesses for the plaintiffs who testified that this particular hemp was delivered by one Miguel Estela; that it was credited to the defendant because it was at first thought that it was his hemp, and that it was afterwards charged back to him on the theory that it was the hemp of Estela.<br\/><br\/>According to the defendant's own testimony, he had Exhibit 1 in his possession for several days.\u00a0 He testified that he and the agent of the creditor spent several days in examining the accounts; that he, the defendant, kept books of account and kept books which showed the amount of hemp which he had delivered to Perez; and that he examined these books of his during the process of the settlement.\u00a0 After this examination he presented to the creditors' agent a list of his objections to the account.\u00a0 The balance against him, as shown by Exhibit 1 as it originally was, amounted to 28,687.65 pesos.\u00a0 He claimed that, by reason of mistakes and errors in the account, it should be reduced by 6,178.62 pesos.\u00a0 The agent of the creditor allowed his entire claim in this respect, subtracted this sum from the original amount, 28,687.65 pesos, and the account was liquidated at the difference, namely, P2,509.03 pesos, which is the exact amount contained in Exhibit A.\u00a0 The plaintiffs' witnesses, testified that the claim as presented in the complaint was taken from the books kept by the creditor and was correct according to those books.\u00a0 The books themselves the plaintiffs produced in court and offered to the defendant for his examination.\u00a0 The defendant testifying as a witness, admitted that he was allowed a reduction of 6,178.62 pesos, but did not undertake to say how that amount was made up. We have no doubt that in it was included this sum of 1,612.20 pesos.<br\/><br\/>The defendant having signed Exhibit A, is bound by it unless at least he shows affirmatively that there was some mistake or error in the settlement.\u00a0 The burden of proof was on him to show such mistake or error, and, if this amount of 1,612.20 pesos was not included in the 6,178.62 pesos it was his duty to show it as he easily could have done.\u00a0 He testified that he himself kept books of account, but he did,not offer them in evidence at the trial.\u00a0 Having before him when he signed Exhibit A his own books, showing the amount of hemp he had delivered, in which book the amount represented by this 1,612.20 pesos must have appeared, it is impossible to believe that he did not then make a claim for an allowance on account of that delivery.<br\/><br\/>It will have been observed that in Exhibit A it is stated that all the accounts pending.between the parties had been arranged, except that relating to the business at Goa in charge of Don Simon Perfecto.\u00a0 On the 29th of August, 1903, the following document was signed by Simon Perfecto:<br\/><blockquote>\"The accounts of the business at Goa which I represent on account and by order of Don Mariano Fuentebella, having been this day settled with Don Tomas R. Perez, I hereby acknowledge the correctness of the balance of 7,434.95 pesos resulting against my account in the business, the sum of $647.03 as the purchase commission on 647.03 piculs of hemp only remaining unpaid; which sum shall be paid to Don Mariano Fuentebella as per contract.<br\/><br\/>\"San Jose, Lagonoy, August 29, 1903.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">(Signed)\u00a0 \"SIMON PERFECTO.\"<br\/><\/div><\/blockquote>The plaintiffs included this amount in their complaint in this action and claimed that the defendant was responsible therefor.\u00a0 He denies such responsibility, alleging that he had nothing to do with the business of Perfecto at Goa except to ask the creditor at one time to deliver to Perfecto 2,000 pesos.\u00a0 The court found against the defendant upon this point and the evidence is entirely in favor of such finding.\u00a0 In the first place Exhibit A itself is a strong indication that the business at Goa belonged to the defendant.\u00a0 The agent of the creditor testified that the defendant told him, the agent, to settle the account with Perfecto, and that he, Perfecto, was authorized to make the settlement.\u00a0 The defendant himself testified that Perfecto was his purchaser at Goa and was in charge of the business there; that he, the defendant, had authorized him to buy hemp, giving him one-half of the commission which he received from the creditor; and that the creditor knew that Perfecto was the agent or purchaser of the defendant at Goa.<br\/><br\/>The business between the parties was entirely closed on the 20th of June, 1904.\u00a0\u00a0 This action was commenced on the 22d of June, 1906,\u00a0 The defendant claims that the balance which appeared\u00a0 against him on the 20th of June, 1904, constituted a mercantile loan made by the creditor to him and that, in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Commerce, no action could be maintained upon it until a notarial demand for its payment had been made by the creditor, and no such demand having been made, the action was prematurely brought.\u00a0 The account between the parties was an ordinary current account between a commercial house in Manila and a dealer in the provinces and embraces a great variety of transactions.\u00a0 It is apparent that the balance which results from the settlement of such a current account can in no sense be called a mercantile loan.\u00a0 (Gutierrez Hermanos <i>vs.<\/i> De la Riva, 7 Off. Gaz., 215.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>)<br\/><br\/>The court below allowed the plaintiffs interest from the 20th of June, 1904.\u00a0 We think that in this respect the court erred and that the plaintiffs are\u00a0 entitled to interest only from the time of the presentation of their complaint.\u00a0 There was no agreement as to interest.\u00a0 The transaction did not constitute a mercantile loan so as to fall within the provisions of article 316 of the Code of Commerce relating to interest.\u00a0 Nor can the balance due on a current account be said to be due for the sale of merchandise, so as to bring the case within article 341 of the same code.\u00a0 It rather falls under articles 1108 and 1100 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 No demand for payment having been made before the bringing of this suit, interest can be allowed only from the presentation of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is modified by providing for interest only from the 22d day of June, 1906.\u00a0 In all other respects it is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

and when the woman asked him why he had done so, Arreglado replied that he had killed him because the deceased had threatened to kill his carabao if he could not manage to steal it, and when, on seeing a man some distance away, she asked Arreglado who it was, he said that it was Juan Buybuy, and after answering compelled her to return to her house, threatening to kill her if she reported the matter to the authorities; and, in order that she might not report the occurrence, the two aggressors kept watch over her the whole of that night; however, on Thursday morning, the third day, she managed to leave her house, with the permission of her guards, under the pretext of looking for a seamstress.\u00a0 While on the street, she met a certain Gregorio Umali (alias Atoy), and informed him that her husband had been murdered by Arreglado and Buybuy, and requested him to report it to the authorities.\u00a0 Umali reported the matter to the municipal president who, after the preliminary investigation, went to the place where the body of the deceased was buried, as pointed out by Bartolome Arreglado who was already in custody; the body was exhumed and recognized by the wife and relatives of the deceased as well as by the president of the local board of health who, upon examining said remains on October 20, found labial wounds, the upper and lower lips being cut without affecting the gums, another wound in the right auricular region inflicted with a blunt instrument, and also a contusion in the right temple which produced cerebral hemorrhage and caused the death of the wounded man, he having been attacked with an iron bar 2 feet long and 1 inch in diameter.<br\/><br\/>In view of the above a complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal on the 27th of November of said year in the Court of First Instance of Tayabas, charging Bartolome Arreglado with the crime of murder; another separate complaint was filed against Juan Buybuy, and proceedings were instituted against the first-named.\u00a0 On the 30th of November, 1908, the trial judge sentenced Bartolome to the penalty of death, to pay an indemnity to the heirs of the deceased, together with the costs, and ordered the case forwarded to this court for review.<br\/><br\/>From the record in the case, it seems to be completely established\u00a0 that a very serious crime, the murder of Felipe Malihan, was committed on the night of October 13 in a barrio of the town of Tiaong, Tayabas.<br\/><br\/>On the body, when exhumed \"by order of the authorities, there were\u00a0 found wounds and contusions\u00a0 which, if not mortal, were very serious, so that the violent death of the said individual should be classified as murder, inasmuch as the specific circumstance of premeditation is clearly manifest; for from the time when the malefactors conceived the idea of, and seriously reflected and meditated on the crime, they planned to carry it through with persistence and reflection, and took preparatory steps which demonstrated their intent.\u00a0 To this end they prepared and dug the grave in which they were to and did bury the body of their victim, and in order to accomplish the murder of the unfortunate Malihan they made use of Claudio Ocampo to summon the deceased on the night of the said 12th of October, divulging at the time to the messenger their criminal\u00a0 intention.\u00a0 When by reason of the information so volunteered Ocampo neglected to obey the order, the criminals persisted in the perpetration of the crime, and one of them, the accused Bartolome Arreglado, went to the house of the victim and called him out in the name of the lieutenant of the barrio, causing him to leave his house by means of said false pretext, and when Malihan went out to obey the lieutenant's order, he was suddenly attacked by the said accused and Juan Buybuy, who had been lying in ambush in the road, and\u00a0 who inflicted upon him wounds that produced his instant death.\u00a0 All of said acts which preceded the crime and were performed successively on different days and hours, as fully proven in the case, show in an unquestionable manner that the\u00a0 death of the said Felipe Malihan was calmly and coolly considered and fully decided upon by the guilty parties, and consequently this crime can not be classified otherwise than as premeditated murder.<br\/><br\/>The evidence introduced by the prosecution satisfactorily and conclusively establishes the guilt of Bartolome Arreglado as one of the two authors of the murder in question, for notwithstanding\u00a0 the fact that the said accused pleaded not guilty, and in spite of his exculpatory allegations tending rather to inculpate his codefendant, Juan Buybuy, who is being separately prosecuted for the same crime, the case furnishes sufficient evidence and weighty and conclusive indications, based on proved facts and confessions by the accused, to produce in the mind, when considered as a whole, according to the rules of sound criticism, the fullest conviction of the guilt of the accused, Bartolome Arreglado, as one of the murderers.<br\/><br\/>Even though it may be deduced from the record in the case that Tomasa Arpon, the widow of the victim, who for many months had been the querida or mistress of Juan Buybuy, the other defendant charged under another complaint, must have been aware of the premeditated murder of her unfortunate husband, as shown by her own statements and other acts even before the crime was committed, it does not, however, prevent her uncontradicted testimony against the authors of the crime, corroborated in several points by the declarations of Claudio Ocampo, Valeriano-Arpon, and the municipal president of Tiaong, Pedro Cantos, from serving as evidence for the prosecution, and, taking the evidence all in all, we consider the criminal responsibility of the accused Bartolome Arreglado as coauthor of the crime as proven, inasmuch as he has stated that he himself called the injured party and made him leave his house, by means of deceit and a false pretext, at 11 o'clock on the night of October 13, while Juan Buybuy awaited his victim on the road.\u00a0 The accused, according to his own declaration, alleges that, though he was present at the place where the crime was committed, he took no part in the deed which was carried out by his codefendant Juan Buybuy alone, but the wife of the injured man testified that she heard her husband cry out \"Bartolo, you have betrayed me,\" and that, when she went to the place where her husband should have been, she was met by Bartolome, who told her that he had killed the latter, and threatened to kill her too if she\u00a0 reported the matter to the authorities.\u00a0 It has also been proven that Bartolome Arreglado assisted Buybuy to bury the body, and when arrested later on, pointed out the place of burial in compliance with the demand of the local authorities.\u00a0 All of said acts clearly show the participation of the accused in the crime, and that it was committed with especial malice, cruelty, and the greatest perversity.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of the crime in question it is proper to consider the presence of circumstances 2, 6, 8, and 15 of article 10 of the Penal Code, for the reason that Felipe Malihan was unprepared and believed that the authorities of the barrio had actually sent for him; he was suddenly attacked from behind, judging from the location of the wounds, according to the statement of the physician who examined the body, and from what Bartolome Arreglado, the accused, stated, corroborated by the cry heard by the wife of the deceased; and further because, in order to make the injured party leave his house, on both occasions the accused and his codefendant employed trickery and deceit, simulating a false order from the lieutenant of the barrio, and in order to facilitate the execution of the crime with impunity, they purposely selected the darkness and silence of night; and, even though the circumstance of abuse of superiority be considered as included in the treachery because the injured party was suddenly attacked by two armed men, making it impossible for him to defend himself or even to escape, the fact must not be ignored that the accused, in order to cause the violent death of the unfortunate Malihan, deliberately increased the enormity of the crime by subjecting him to unnecessary suffering in order to deprive him of his life, such as the cutting off of his upper and lower lips; an act of cruelty which they had no need to perform in order to kill him.\u00a0 There is not a single mitigating circumstance to compensate any of the aggravating ones mentioned and, in view of the nature of the crime and the circumstances and conditions surrounding it, and the trickery and perversity with which it was performed, no reason whatever exists that would justify the application in his favor of the mitigating circumstance established by article 11 of the code.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, in view of the foregoing reasons, it is our opinion that the judgment submitted for review should be affirmed, provided, however, that Bartolome Arreglado shall be sentenced to pay jointly and severally with Juan Buybuy, who has also been sentenced in the case brought against him, an indemnity of P1,000 to the widow and heirs of the deceased, with costs, the sentence to be executed in accordance with Acts Nos. 451 and 1577; and provided further, that in the event of a pardon being granted by a conmutation of the penalty, he shall also be sentenced to suffer the accessory penalties of article 53 of the code unless the same be specially included in the pardon.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

No. 3075, April 14, 1909<\/h2>\n<h3>THE ROMAN CATHOLIC APOSTOLIC CHURCH, PLAINTIFF, <i>VS.<\/i> SEVERAL MUNICIPALITIES OF THE PROVINCE OF OCCIDENTAL NEGROS AND THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE INDEPENDENT FILIPINO CHURCH, GREGORIO AGLIPAY, AND NARCISO HIJALDA, DEFENDANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">From a consideration of the original proceedings filed in this court for the recovery of the possession of certain buildings used by the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, and the answers thereto and evidence presented, it appears:<br\/><br\/>That the defendants, by their answers, rely upon two classes of defense, one of law, and the other of fact.\u00a0 The former is contained in the following allegations:<br\/><br\/>(1)\u00a0 That Act No. 1376, governing these proceedings, is unconstitutional;<br\/><br\/>(2)\u00a0 That the plaintiff church does not possess juridical personality;<br\/><br\/>(3)\u00a0 That the property claimed by the plaintiff is not her own, but formerly belonged to the Spanish Government and is now owned by the Government of the United States of America in these Islands; and<br\/><br\/>(4)\u00a0 That said property is part of the public domain and was transferred by the former to the present sovereignty, to wit, that of the United States; that said property falls within, the provisions of section 12 of the Act of July 1, 1902; and that finally said property was so classed by paragraph 2 of article 25 of the regulations for the application of the Mortgage Law, which provides that parish property can not be inscribed in the registry of property.<br\/><br\/>All these questions have already been finally determined in similar decisions formerly rendered by this Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>The first question-as to the constitutionality of Act No. 1376-was decided in the case of The Roman Catholic Apostolic Church <i>vs.<\/i> The Municipalities of Tarlac and Victoria (9 Phil. Rep., 450).<br\/><br\/>The second, as to the personality of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, in Barlin <i>vs.<\/i> Ramirez (7 Phil. Rep., 41).<br\/><br\/>The third was also determined in the case of Barlin <i>vs.<\/i> Ramirez, in The Roman Catholic Apostolic Church <i>vs.<\/i> Santos (7 Phil. Rep., 66), and in the city of Manila <i>vs.<\/i> The Roman Catholic Apostolic Church (8 Phil. Rep., 763); and<br\/><br\/>The fourth question was decided in these same cases, and also in the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church<i> vs.<\/i> The Municipality of Badoc (10 Phil. Rep., 659).\u00a0 The legal principles set out in the above-cited cases may, therefore, be regarded as reproduced herein.<br\/><br\/>The facts relied upon by the defense are dealt with in relation to each municipality, and having regard to the contentions of the plaintiff, this court will proceed to consider the evidence presented in this action.<br\/><br\/><i>Municipality of Valladolid<\/i>.-There is claimed the church building of Valladolid and the churchyard, the convent of Valladolid and its yard, and the cemetery of Valladolid.<br\/><br\/>The first witness brought by the plaintiff is one \"Lorenzo Paloma, 62 years old, a resident of Valladolid, and Bishop of the Filipino Independent Church,\" who testified that, from October, 1898, until March, 1903, he was in possession of the church building, convent, and the cemetery of Valladolid in his capacity of curate appointed by the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church and under the same conditions as those imposed upon his predecessor in office; that since March, 1903, he, as curate appointed by the Filipino Independent Church, has been in the material possession of the church building, while the municipality has held that of the convent and the cemetery, and that the convent is used as the residence of the curate.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the history of the administration of the above-described property, the witness testified that he was in Valladolid in the years 1867 and 1871, on the occasion of the diocesan visits paid to the parish by two bishops who were in charge of the diocese which included the town of Valladolid within its jurisdiction, the said witness acting as secretary to the diocesan bishop during the visit paid in 1871; that during all this period up to the time of the revolution no person or entity, other than the diocesan bishop and the parish priest, had administered and possessed the church building, convent and cemetery; that he, in his capacity of secretary of the visiting bishop had examined the accounts rendered by the parish priests to the bishop in regard to the church and cemetery of Valladolid; that he knew that the diocesan bishop compelled the inhabitants of a town to build a house for the parish priest before he would appoint such priest; that in 1895 he was made coadjutor to the curate of Valladolid, who was a member of the Order of Recoletos of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, and that the witness was also a priest of said community and as such priest of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church he administered the holy sacraments to the inhabitants of Valladolid; that toward the end of the year 1898, the municipality notified him that a military commissioner (<i>delegado de guerra<\/i>) had appointed him curate of Valladolid, and that the church building1 and <i>convento<\/i> were turned over to him; that from that time he had taken possession of the said church and <i>convento<\/i>, which later were seized by the revolutionary government. (P. 160.)<br\/><br\/>Another witness, Felipe Benedicto, corroborated the possession and administration of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church of the property claimed by her, to wit, the church building, the <i>convento<\/i> sites upon which they were built, together with the cemetery of the municipality of Valladolid, and stated that at the present time the municipality is in possession of the <i>convento<\/i> and its yard, and the church building and churchyard are possessed by Father Paloma, in his capacity of Aglipayan curate.\u00a0 Counsel for the defendant admitted that, from the year 1884 until November 5, 1898, the cemetery of Valladolid, wherein only the bodies of faithful Roman Catholics were buried, was in the possession and under the administration and control of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, but that at the present time the <i>convento<\/i> and cemetery are in the possession of the municipality, and the church building in that of Father Paloma, the Aglipayan curate.\u00a0 The defendants produced various witnesses who averred that, with the exception of two or three families, all the inhabitants of the town are affiliated with the Philippine Independent Church.\u00a0 This allegation is wholly immaterial to this question.<br\/><br\/>Whereas the detention and seizure by Lorenzo Paloma and the municipality of Valladolid, of the property belonging to the plaintiff and the subject of these proceedings has been fully established by proof;<br\/><br\/>We adjudge and decree that the plaintiff church is entitled to the possession of the property referred to in this part of the complaint, to wit:\u00a0 the church building and the <i>convento<\/i> of Valladolid, together with the sites upon which they are erected, and the cemetery of Valladolid; and we order and direct that said plaintiff be placed in possession immediately and that the present occupants be ejected therefrom.<br\/><br\/>In order to carry out the restitution ordered above, pursuant to the provisions of Act No. 190, the Code of Civil Procedure, let a writ of possession be issued against the defendants Lorenzo Paloma and the municipality of Valladolid, without special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Municipality of Cadiz<\/i>.-There are claimed (a) the <i>convento<\/i> and the lot whereon it is erected; (b) the cemetery of Cadiz; and, in the barrio of Sicaba, within the jurisdiction of the said municipality of Cadiz, the land formerly occupied by the demolished church building of said barrio.\u00a0 The complaint in regard to these properties has made Gregorio Aglipay, Narciso Hijalda, and the municipality of Cadiz parties defendant.<br\/><br\/>According to the testimony of the priest Juan Hofile\u00f1a, curate of Saravia, of Baltasar Llorace and Esteban Batayalo, and of Feliciano Gomez, a priest, the said properties were possessed and administered by priests of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, however, by a writing dated January 27, 1908, has laid claim to the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">convento <\/span>and the land whereon it stands, and the 6emetery of Cadiz.<br\/><br\/>Whereas the seizure by the Independent Filipino Church and the municipality of Cadiz, and the possession and administration by the plaintiff have been fully proven:<br\/><br\/>We adjudge and decree that the plaintiff is entitled to the immediate possession of the above-described property, and that neither the municipality of Cadiz nor the Independent Filipino Church, or their representatives Gregorio Aglipay, Narciso Hijalda, and Juan Hofilena, have any right or interest in said property.<br\/><br\/>Let a writ of possession be issued by this court against said persons in the manner and form provided by Act No. 190.\u00a0 No special ruling is made as to costs against either party.<br\/><br\/><i>Municipality of Ilog<\/i>.-The plaintiff claims:\u00a0 (a) the church building of Hog, the adjacent <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">convento<\/span>, and the parcels of land on which they are erected; (b) the church bells and all the articles and ornaments used for the service of the Roman Catholic Apostolic faith; and (c) the cemetery of said town of Hog.<br\/><br\/>From the testimony given by vice-president Bruno de Leon, member of the Aglipayan committee, and by Lucas Nadal and Bartolome Tolon, it appears proven that all the properties claimed in the complaint and situated in the municipality of Ilog belong to the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church and that at present the church building is detained by the committee of the Independent Filipino Church, and the convent and cemetery by the municipality.\u00a0 (Pp. 78, 217, 245.)<br\/><br\/>We, therefore, find and decree that the plaintiff Roman Catholic Apostolic Church is entitled to the possession of said properties, and we order and decree that they be restored to the possession of the plaintiff and that the defendants be ejected therefrom.<br\/><br\/>Let a writ of possession be issued by this court against the defendants detaining said properties, in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 190, without special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Barrio of Gusi<\/i>.-It is also proven that the church building or hermitage with its bells, belonging to the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, is being detained by the committee of the Independent Filipino Church.<br\/><br\/>We adjudge and decree that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of that property, and we order and decree that it be restored to the possession of the plaintiff, and the defendants or whoever are holding the same be ejected therefrom, and that the plaintiff be placed in possession, without special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/>Let a writ of possession be issued by this court against the defendants Gregorio Aglipay, Bishop of the Independent Filipino Church, and the committee of said Church in the municipality of Ilog.<br\/><br\/><i>Old town of Cabancalan<\/i>.-It is likewise proven that the church building, the ruins of the convento and the parcels of land on which said buildings are erected, as well as the cemetery of Cabancalan, are the property of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, and are detained by the members of the Aglipayan Church or by the committee of said Church.<br\/><br\/>We adjudge and decree that the plaintiff is entitled to be immediately placed in possession of said properties, and we order and decree that the same be restored to the plaintiff and that the defendants or those in possession of the same be ejected therefrom, and that the plaintiff be put in possession, without special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/>Let a writ of possession be issued by this court against the defendants Gregorio Aglipay, Bishop of the Independent Filipino Church, or the committee of said church in the old town of Cabancalan.<br\/><br\/><i>Barrio of Dancalan, and barrio of Guiljungan<\/i>.-It is in like manner established that the church building, its grounds and the grounds of the <i>convento<\/i>, the bells and the articles and ornaments of the church are now in the possession of the committee of the Independent Filipino Church, and the cemetery is in the possession of the municipality; and that the chapel of Guiljungan and the ground on which it is erected, cited in the writing filed by the plaintiff on January 27, 1908, are now in the possession of the Aglipayan priest.<br\/><br\/>We hold that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of said properties, and we order and decree that the same be restored to the possession of the plaintiff, and that the defendants or the person detaining them be ejected therefrom, and the plaintiff be put in possession, without special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/>Let a writ of possession be issued by this court against the defendants Gregorio Aglipay, bishop of the Independent Filipino Church, or the committee of said church.<br\/><br\/><i>Municipality of Silay<\/i>.-The cemetery of the town is claimed by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>It was proven by the testimony of two witnesses, and even by that of the municipal president that the cemetery was administered by the parish priest of the Catholic Church for more than twenty years prior to its seizure by the municipality.<br\/><br\/>We hold and declare that the plaintiff is entitled to continue in the possession thereof, and we order and decree that the possession thereof shall be immediately restored to said plaintiff, without special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/>Let a proper writ of possession be issued by this court against the municipality of Silay.<br\/><br\/><i>Municipality of Victorias<\/i>.-There are claimed:\u00a0 (a) The <i>convento<\/i> and the lot on which it is erected; (b) the land on which the ruins of the old church stand; and (c) the cemetery.<br\/><br\/>Whereas it has also been proven that said properties belonged to the plaintiff and were administered by the parish priests appointed thereby until their seizure by the municipality of Victorias:<br\/><br\/>We adjudge and decree that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession thereof, and we order and decree that said plaintiff be immediately restored therein, and that the municipality of Victorias be ejected therefrom.<br\/><br\/>Let a writ be issued by this court to that effect; no special ruling is made as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Municipality of Saravia, and barrio of Tansa<\/i>.-The plaintiff claims the cemeteries of Saravia and Tansa.<br\/><br\/>It was proven that they belonged to the plaintiff and that she possessed them through her parish priests until they were seized by the municipality of Saravia.<br\/><br\/>We hold and decree that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession thereof and we order and decree that they be restored to the plaintiff and that the municipality be ejected therefrom.<br\/><br\/>Let the proper writ be issued to this end, without special ruling as to costs. <i>Municipality of Manapla<\/i>.-There are claimed:\u00a0 (a) The <i>convento<\/i> adjoining the church building of Manapla, and the land on which it is erected; and (b) the cemetery of Manapla.<br\/><br\/>Whereas it has been proven that the plaintiff was in the possession of said properties through her parish priests until their seizure by the municipality, and that the land occupied by the cemetery was the property of the church;<br\/><br\/>We hold and decree that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession thereof, and we hereby order and decree that said plaintiff be placed in possession of the same, and that the municipality be ejected therefrom.<br\/><br\/>Let the proper writ issue from this court to that effect, without special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Municipality of Pontevedra; barrio of La Castellana within the jurisdiction of Pontevedra<\/i>.-There are claimed:\u00a0 (a) The church building of Pontevedra, the <i>convento<\/i> adjacent thereto, and the land occupied by said buildings; (b) the cemetery of Pontevedra; (c) the demolished church of La Castellana and the land on which it was erected; (d) the demolished <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">convento <\/span>of La Castellana, according to the writing presented by the plaintiff, formerly known as the <i>convento of La Castellana.<\/i><br\/><br\/>It has been fully proven that all the above-described properties were in the possession of the plaintiff, and this is corroborated even by the testimony of the witnesses for the defense.\u00a0 This legal status is not in the least affected by Exhibit No. 1 of the defense, to wit, that said properties are set out in an inventory of property belonging to the Spanish Government, nor by the fact that the inhabitants of Pontevedra and La Castellana continue to belong to the Catholic faith or may have joined the Aglipayan cult, or that the number of the latter is greater than that of the former, because the rights of said inhabitants are not at issue in this case.<br\/><br\/>We, therefore, hold and decree that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of the properties mentioned above and by virtue thereof we order and decree that they be immediately restored to the plaintiff and that the defendants be ejected therefrom.<br\/><br\/>Let a writ of possession be issued to the plaintiff against Gregorio Aglipay, or any member of the Independent Filipino Church, and the municipality of Pontevedra, who detain the same, without special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Municipality of La Carlota; pueblo of San Enrique<\/i>.-The original complaint as well as the writing filed on January 27, 1908, only make demand for the return of the property situated in the latter town; nevertheless, the evidence submitted by both sides also relates to the property situated in the former.<br\/><br\/>This court, taking into consideration the text of the complaint, which has not been amended, will only consider the evidence submitted upon the subject of the property located in the pueblo of San Enrique.The following is claimed:\u00a0 (a) The church building of San Enrique, the <i>convento<\/i> adjacent thereto, and the land occupied by both buildings;\u00a0 and (b) the cemetery of San Enrique Cipriano Perez, a witness for the plaintiff, said that he has known the said property since 1870, that it was in the possession and under the administration of parish priests appointed by the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church; that the church building was furnished with all the articles and ornaments necessary for worship, and that the former municipality of San Enrique, and now that of La Carlota, seized said property in 1898.<br\/><br\/>Four witnesses took the stand for the defense, and their testimony supports rather than overcomes the right of the plaintiff.\u00a0 Said witnesses testified that the church building, <i>convento<\/i>, and the belfry were built by order of the governor of the province during the Spanish sovereignty; that the bells, chasubles and other requisites were donated to the Church; that although the land occupied by the cemetery was donated by a private person, in the judgment of one of the witnesses, it now belongs to the State; that all the properties above-described figure in a statement signed during the former sovereignty by the Catholic parish priest (Exhibit No. 2)} and that lastly all the inhabitants belong to the Aglipayan cult.<br\/><br\/>We hold and declare that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of the above-described property, and we order and decree that said property be immediately restored thereto and that the persons detaining them be ejected therefrom.<br\/><br\/>Let a writ of possession issue against the municipality of La Carlota and the proper persons, without special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Municipality of Jinigaran<\/i>.-According to its last writing filed with this court, the plaintiff claims:\u00a0 (a) The <i>convento<\/i> of Jinigaran and the lot on which it is built;

The latter, a witness for the plaintiff, testified that the Church, through the parish priests appointed by her, had the possession, use and enjoyment of the property in controversy.<br\/><br\/>We hold and declare that the plaintiff is entitled to said property and we order and decree that the same be immediately restored thereto and that the persons detaining them be ejected.<br\/><br\/>Let the writ of possession issue against the municipality of Jinigaran and the proper persons.\u00a0 No special ruling is made as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Municipality of Jimamaylan<\/i>.-The following is claimed by the plaintiff: (a) The church building of Jimamaylan, the adjacent <i>convento<\/i>, the new church building in construction, and the land on which said buildings are located; (b) the cemetery of Jimamaylan.<br\/><br\/>it has been proven that the plaintiff was in possession of the property in controversy up to the time of the seizure of the church building and the cemetery of the committee of the Independent Filipino Church by reason of the Aglipayan schism, and of the church building in construction and the <i>convento<\/i> by the municipality.<br\/><br\/>The rights of the plaintiff are supported by the statements of the witnesses for the defendants, who said that the lands on which the buildings were erected belonged to the State; that the same w\u00a3re built by order of the governor of the province, and that the money therefor was obtained from the <i>sanctorum<\/i> and poll-tax funds.<br\/><br\/>We adjudge and declare that the plaintiff is entitled to the said properties and we order and decree that the same be immediately restored thereto, and that the persons detaining them be ejected therefrom.<br\/><br\/>Let the proper writ issue against said detainers, without special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Pueblo of Suay, now annexed to the municipality of Jimamaylan.<\/i>-The plaintiff claims:\u00a0 (a) The ruins of the church building of Suay and the land on which it was erected; (b) the cemetery of Suay.<br\/><br\/>The possession by the plaintiff has in like manner been fully established.<br\/><br\/>We make a similar finding, decree and order against the municipality of Jimamaylan which took possession of the land, demolished church building, and cemetery.<br\/><br\/>Let a writ of possession issue against said municipality.<br\/><br\/><i>Municipality of Isabela<\/i>.-There are claimed:\u00a0 (a) The <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">convento <\/span>adjacent to the church building, and the land on which the church and the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">convento <\/span>of the town are erected.<br\/><br\/><i>Barrio of Magallon, annexed to said municipality<\/i>.-There are claimed: (a) The land on which the demolished church building of Magallon and the adjoining <i>convento<\/i> were erected; (b) the cemetery of Magallon.<br\/><br\/>The right of the plaintiff, who had the possession and enjoyment of said properties, is well supported by the evidence.<br\/><br\/>We adjudge and declare that the plaintiff is entitled thereto, and by virtue thereof, we order and decree that possession of the same be immediately restored thereto, and that the persons detaining them be ejected therefrom.<br\/><br\/>Let a proper writ of possession be issued to that effect.\u00a0 No special ruling is made as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Municipality of Escalante<\/i>.-There are claimed:\u00a0 (a) The belfry and the bells of the church of Escalante and the lot on which it is erected; (b) the cemetery of Escalante.<br\/><br\/><i>Barrio of Honob-Honob<\/i>.-There are claimed:\u00a0 (a) The chapel of Honob-Honob and the lot on which it stands; (b) the cemetery of Honob-Honob.<br\/><br\/>According to the testimony of Miguel Gamao, a witness for the plaintiff, it appears that the belfry of Escalante and the land on which it is erected are in the possession of the Catholic parish priest, but the land on which the chapel is built and the cemetery of Honob-Honob are held by the municipality of Escalante.<br\/><br\/>The defendants' witnesses claim to be entitled to the said property on the grounds that the bells were donated by inhabitants of the town, their names being engraved on the largest bell, but they stated that said bells were given for the use of the church.\u00a0 As to the cemetery, which, as stated by one of them was consecrated by reason thereof it is clear that the municipality is not entitled to possess it.<br\/><br\/>We adjudge and declare that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of the property claimed, and we order and decree that said possession be immediately restored thereto, and that the person detaining them be ejected therefrom.<br\/><br\/>Let a proper writ of possession issue therefor, without special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Municipality of Cauayan<\/i>.-The plaintiff claims:\u00a0 (a) The church building of Cauayan, the ruined convent adjoining thereto, and the land on which they are erected; (b) the old cemetery of Cauayan, and the new cemetery of the same town.<br\/><br\/><i>Barrio of Isui, municipality of Cauayan<\/i>.-The plaintiff claims the chapel and the lot on which it stands, located in said barrio.<br\/><br\/>The possession by the plaintiff is supported by the evidence and even by the testimony of the witnesses of the adverse party.\u00a0 Said witnesses while stating that the parcels of land on which the buildings were erected were the property of private individuals, have nevertheless affirmed that said parcels were donated to the plaintiff and that the work of construction was carried out with funds derived from the poll tax; in view of the purpose for which they were intended they can not be held to belong to the municipality.<br\/><br\/>We adjudge and declare that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession thereof, and we order and decree that they be immediately restored thereto, and that the municipality or any person detaining the same be ejected therefrom.<br\/><br\/>Let a writ of possession be issued therefor.\u00a0 No special ruling is made as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Guijulgan, a pueblo now annexed to the municipality of Cauayan<\/i>.-There are claimed:\u00a0 (a) The demolished church building of Guijulgan, the adjacent <i>convento<\/i>, and the land on which said buildings are erected; (b) the cemetery of Guijulgan,<br\/><br\/>In a manner similar to the former it has also been established that the plaintiff had been in the possession of said property through the medium of its priests.\u00a0 It is contended by the defendants, however, that all the inhabitants of Cauayan and its barrios are now enrolled in the Independent Filipino Church.<br\/><br\/>But it should be noted, with reference to the property situated in the municipality of Hog, that the complaint lays claim to the chapel of <i>Guilhugan<\/i> and the land on which it is erected. Thus, according to the complaint, the pueblo of <i>Guilhugan<\/i>, now a part of the municipality of Cauayan, is separate and distinct from the barrio of <i>Guilhugan<\/i> of the municipality of Hog.\u00a0 Yet, Lucas Nadal, testifying for the plaintiff, has stated the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q.\u00a0 Do you know if during the Spanish Government there was in the pueblo of Hog, a barrio called Guilongan?-A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Are you acquainted with this barrio of Guilongan or Guilhungan within the jurisdiction of Hog and of the municipality of Cauayan?-A.\u00a0 Yes, sir; I am acquainted with it.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.

When testifying on the matter the defendant literally stated?\u00a0 \"<i>She<\/i> (the plaintiff) <i>executed a document by which she gave the house as security.\u00a0 She gave the house in guaranty, but nothing more.\"<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 Later on, referring to the said Exhibit 2 he added:\u00a0 \"This is the document that she handed me giving me the house <i>as security for the debt,\"<\/i> and further on, when questioned as to whether the document was dated in 1902, he answered:\u00a0 \"Yes, sir; that is to say, when she gave the house <i>as a security for the debt\"<\/i>\u00a0 Of the three witnesses to the document, two testified at the trial, and both agree with the defendant, that the house was given to guarantee the payment of the debt.\u00a0 Such being the case, as the defendant himself and his witnesses have thus explained, that the true intention of the parties when executing the document, Exhibit 2, was simply to secure the payment of the credit of the said defendant with the house as a guarantee, it is clear and evident that the plaintiff continued to be the lawful owner of the latter, and that the defendant did not acquire the ownership of the same by reason of the aforesaid document, nor had he, therefore, the right to destroy, it, or to order its destruction and to take possession and\u00a0 dispose of its materials, because these were real acts of dominion which could not have been transferred to him by a simple contract of guaranty, even though it contained, which it did not, all the essential requisites of an actual contract of mortgage.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing is on the supposition that the execution of the said Exhibits was a real fact; but the court below did not consider that it had been proven, in view of the conflicting testimony of the witnesses of the defendant; the result of the evidence corroborates the opinion of the trial judge.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant declared that the document above alluded to was written by a certain Esteban Gonzalez while his witnesses say that it was written by Claudio Ralota, and not by Esteban, who was not present at the time when the document was signed.\u00a0 Several other contradictions of importance are observed in the declarations of the defendant and his witnesses, which on being considered together, cause their testimony to appear at least very suspicious, as the court below has rightly stated in the judgment appealed from.<br\/><br\/>It is requested in the complaint that \"judgment be entered in favor of the\u00a0 plaintiffs for the possession of the materials of the house unlawfully retained by the defendant, or for the sum of 500 pesos in case the same are not to be found.\"\u00a0 The judge below sentenced the defendant specifically to pay the sum of 500 pesos without any ruling whatever with respect to the materials as prayed for in the first part of the complaint, and\u00a0 this is assigned as an error in the brief of the defendant appellant.\u00a0 In addition to the petition just transcribed the plaintiffs made in the complaint a general request for any other remedy that may be in accordance with the law, in conformity with the provisions of section 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 Section 126 of the said code authorizes the lower court in those cases in which the defendant has answered the complaint, as happens in this case, to grant the plaintiff any other relief that may be considered equitable within what has been alleged and proven, without being required to abide by what was literally prayed for in the complaint.\u00a0 In accordance with said provisions the lower court did not err when sentencing the defendant to pay the amount mentioned above, it having been proven on the other hand, in our opinion, that the house destroyed by said defendant was actually worth 500 pesos.<br\/><br\/>In the judgment appealed from it is held that, in view of the fact that the plaintiffs were unjustly deprived of the use of the house, they were prejudiced to the extent of 150 pesos and in consequence thereof the defendant is sentenced to pay the said sum as losses and damages.\u00a0 The appellant does not impugn the finding of the court below with regard to the reality and extent of the damages suffered by the plaintiffs in respect of which he says absolutely nothing, nor does he raise any question whatever in his brief for which reason this point remains beyond all controversy in the present instance.\u00a0 He maintains, however, that the sentence for losses and\u00a0 damages should include only the legal interest on the amount at which the house was assessed and to the payment of which he has been sentenced, for the reason that, as he states, the sum is a net one.\u00a0 This claim can not be sustained under the law.\u00a0 Interest is computed as a just compensation for loss and damages when the latter arise from the default of the debtor in his obligation which consists in the\u00a0 payment of a sum of money. (Art. 1108, Civil Code.)\u00a0 In the present case there is no question as to the collection of any money debt, or of any default on the part of the defendant, but of indemnity for the Value of a house which the defendant had no right to destroy, and of the prejudice that he caused the plaintiffs by his unlawful and unjust act, and it is quite obvious that the actual and true extent of such damages, which has not been controverted by the appellant), is what must serve as the basis and measure for the indemnity, according to the most elemental principles of justice and law.\u00a0 Hence, the error assigned by the appellant to this part of the judgment appealed from does not exist.<br\/><br\/>The judgment is hereby affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

the document marked \"Exhibit A,\" and itemized account of his services, duly sworn to, as the basis of his claim, being made a part of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, Jose Alejandre, being duly summoned, appeared by his attorneys, and on the 29th of November of the same year demurred to the complaint, alleging that the facts set forth therein did not constitute a sufficient cause for action, and that the same was ambiguous, unintelligible, and vague; but by an order of the court dated February 21, said demurrer was, upon request of the petitioner, considered withdrawn, and the defendant ordered to answer the complaint within five days as if the demurrer had been overruled.<br\/><br\/>On the 26th of February, 1908, the defendant answered the complaint and made a general and specific denial of each and all of the facts alleged therein as a cause of action, and asked the court to dismiss the complaint with costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The case came up for trial, the evidence adduced by both parties was heard, and the documents produced by them made of record.\u00a0 On the 1st of April, 1908, the trial court entered judgment, sentencing the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of P593.75 only, without any special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/>On the 10th of the said month of April, the plaintiff moved for a new trial on the ground that the said judgment was contrary to law and to the weight of the evidence, which was insufficient to justify it.\u00a0 The motion was overruled, whereupon the plaintiff excepted on the 14th of the said month, and announced his intention to appeal to the Supreme Court by means of a bill of exceptions, which having been approved, was forwarded to the clerk of this court together with the documents offered by both parties.<br\/><br\/>The question involved in this suit is the recovery of certain professional fees by virtue of a contract for lease of services as provided for by article 1544 of the Civil Code in which connection the plaintiff, as a physician, rendered professional services to the defendant who was sick at the time.<br\/><br\/>The contending parties agree that the plaintiff, upon request of the defendant, who was suffering from ulcers on the left knee, rendered him medical assistance and paid him 146 visits in Virac and ten in Bato during six months in order to cure him, and that no agreement had been entered into between them as to the fees that the patient was to pay the physician.<br\/><br\/>On the supposition that the defendant was obliged to pay the fees earned for the treatment of his ailment, the plaintiff, who had received the sum of P300 on account, made up and sent in the bill attached to the complaint and marked \"Exhibit A\" from which it appears that for 146 calls made in Virac where both the patient and the physician resided, and 10 calls made in Bato, together with\u00a0 the cost of seven prescriptions, the defendant owed P3,161.75; deducting therefrom the P300 received in advance, the plaintiff claimed payment of the balance, to wit, P2,861.75, which the defendant refused to pay notwithstanding the repeated requests of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>In deciding the litigation the lower court stated in its decision that the only question which it was called upon to decide was whether or not P80 for each call made in Bato, and P16 for each one made in Virac where the doctor resided, was,a reasonable charge.<br\/><br\/>In view of the fact that no price was stipulated for the medical attendance rendered, the trial judge, in the discretion that, the law and the established rule grant him, and in view of the evidence, held, for the reasons stated in his decision, that the amounts above referred to were and are very excessive for the visits made in the two places mentioned, and stated that, in his opinion, P30 for each medical visit made from Virac to Bato, and P4 for each one made in Virac was a reasonable fee; therefore, the ten visits made to Bato at the rate of P30 each amount to P300, and the 146 made in Virac at P4 each amount to P584, both of which amounts, together with the P9.75, cost of the medicines, make a total of P893.75, from which the P300 paid in advance must be deducted, leaving a balance of P593.75 which the defendant was sentenced to pay to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>In spite of the allegations of the plaintiff appellant we find no legal reason or basis to establish the existence of the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from, which, in our opinion, is in accordance with the law and the merits of the case.\u00a0 In the absence of an agreed price between the physician and the patient, the latter must be compelled to pay to the former a reasonable and just remuneration, the amount of which shall be fixed by the trial judge in his decision according to the claims made and approved by the litigants and either with or without expert testimony.<br\/><br\/>Hence, in the case of a contract for hire of services such as those rendered by a physician to a sick person, where no rate has been fixed\u00a0 the courts shall determine an equitable one according to the uses and customs of the place.\u00a0 The supreme court of Spain so held when applying the provisions of said article 1544 of the\u00a0 Civil Code in its decision of October 18, 1899, which reads:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"A contract for the lease of work or services under the provisions of this article which is in accordance with what has already been determined in law 1, title 8 of partida 5, consists in one of the parties binding himself to execute some work, or to render a service to the other for a certain price, provided that the latter exists, as held by the supreme tribunal, not only when it has been\u00a0 expressly agreed upon but also when it is fixed by the custom and usage of the place in which such services are rendered.\" <\/blockquote><br\/>With relation to article 1547 the said court also established [May 7, 1901] the following doctrine:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Considering that it does not violate article 1547 of the Civil Code either, according to the terms of which the price of the lease must be agreed upon, because it is none the less agreed upon even though not stated in a numerically determined amount, if, when entering into a contract of lease for services the price is settled in connection with an event that may determine it, as occurs in the present case, wherein, as set forth above, the remuneration was contingent upon the payment of the first pay roll by the management.\u00a0 The contention therefore that the fixing of the price depended solely on the will of the person about to receive the same, as erroneously alleged in the appeal, is a mistaken one, though indirectly, his activity or negligence in the performance of his duties might either favor or prejudice the pensioners, that is a matter foreign to this suit, in which it is not intended to make X responsible for\u00a0 the negligence attributed to him.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>Thus it is now a doctrine established by the courts, that in the absence of an express agreement regarding the price of the service rendered, the fixing of said price shall not depend on the exclusive will of the party who is to receive it, and inasmuch as the disagreement or controversy is solely concerning the amount involved, it is for the courts to determine it within just and reasonable limits according to the custom of the place where the service was rendered.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

RAFFERTY, COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On or about the 18th day of February, 1905, Juan Co, the plaintiff in this\u00a0 action, arrived\u00a0 on board a vessel in the harbor of Cebu direct from China and sought to land.\u00a0 Disembarkation was refused by the customs authorities on the ground that he was a subject of China and as such was not entitled to enter the Philippine\u00a0 Islands.\u00a0 He alleged that he was 17 years of age and a native of the Philippine Islands; that he was the illegitimate son of a Filipino woman and of a Chinese merchant, both residents of Cebu at the time of his birth; that he was taken to China by his father when he was 6 or 7 years of age; and that his father had not since that time returned to the Philippine Islands, but had remained continuously in China; that, on arriving at an age where he could care for himself, he had left his father in China and returned to the Philippine Islands, desiring to resume a residence in the country where he was born.\u00a0 These claims of the plaintiff were duly and personally investigated by the defendant in the case, who was then, as now, collector of customs of the city of Cebu.\u00a0 At hearings appointed for the purpose the defendant heard the declarations and the testimony of the plaintiff, of his alleged mother, and of all other witnesses whom the plaintiff desired to produce in favor of his contentions.\u00a0 Thereafter the defendant appointed a commission to investigate the allegations of the plaintiff as to his right to land and his claim to citizenship in the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 That commission heard the proofs and declarations by the plaintiff, and of his alleged mother and all other witnesses whom the plaintiff desired to produce, and, after having carefully investigated the merits of the case, rendered a decision in which they found that the contentions of the plaintiff were not sustained and that he was not entitled to land in the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>A careful investigation of the record in this case discloses that the plaintiff has not been deprived of any opportunity to present such proofs as he desired and has been denied no privilege which the law confers.\u00a0 He was given every opportunity to protect his rights.\u00a0 A fair and impartial hearing was given him in the manner prescribed by law, and, after due deliberation upon the part of those authorities, based upon the proofs of the case, it was found\u00a0 as a fact that the plaintiff was not born in the Philippine Islands, but was born in China, and that he had no right to be admitted into the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 The proceedings referred to were duly transmitted to the defendant by the commission, and he, after having personally investigated the matter himself, approved the findings of the commission and ordered the deportation of the plaintiff.\u00a0 After having been passed upon by the defendant, the matter, with all the record, was transmitted to the Collector of Customs for the Philippine Islands, who, after a careful review of the whole case, in a written opinion, approved the action of the defendant and of the commission appointed by him.\u00a0 Later the matter was presented, at the request of the plaintiff, to the Secretary of Finance and Justice, who, after a careful review of the whole proceedings, approved the same.<br\/><br\/>While the proceedings above mentioned were being carried on, the plaintiff was permitted to land in the city of Cebu upon giving a bond conditioned that he would hold himself ready for deportation if it should finally be determined that he was not entitled to land.\u00a0 While enjoying the privileges thus given to him in the city of Cebu, the plaintiff on or about the 27th day of February, 1905, caused proceedings to be instituted in the Court of First Instance of the city of Cebu having for their object the adoption of the plaintiff by a Chinese resident of the city of Cebu named Co Kip Jat.\u00a0 Such proceedings were carried to a successful issue and the plaintiff was on said date duly adopted as a son of the said Co Kip Jat pursuant to the laws of the Philippine Islands, under which said proceedings were brought.<br\/><br\/>The claims of the plaintiff as to his right to land having been defeated by the decision of the customs authorities above referred to, the plaintiff, by his attorney, Martin M. Levering, on or about the 28th day of February, 1907, instituted the action at bar, in which the plaintiff asked that the court decree an order of perpetual prohibition preventing the defendant from deporting the plaintiff from the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 He alleges two grounds as the basis of such action:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the plaintiff was born in the city of Cebu of a Chinese father and a Filipino mother and that he was a natural-born citizen of the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That having been duly adopted as a son of Co Kip Jat in the proceedings above referred to, he, upon the successful termination of those proceedings, became a citizen of the Philippine Islands\u00a0 and had the right to remain therein.<br\/><br\/>That action was brought to trial before the Court of First Instance of the city of Cebu on the 20th day of April, 1907.\u00a0 Substantially the same evidence was produced by the plaintiff in this case as was produced by him before the collector of customs and his commission above referred to.\u00a0 The only substantial difference was the testimony relative to the adoption of the plaintiff by Co Kip Jat.\u00a0 At the conclusion of the trial the court rendered a decision adverse to the plaintiff's claim.\u00a0 From that judgment the plaintiff appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>As to the claim of the plaintiff that he has a right in the Philippine Islands because of his having been born here under the circumstances above set forth, it must be, and is, denied.\u00a0 That question has been settled adversely to plaintiff's claim by the Supreme Court of the United States and by the Supreme Court of the\u00a0 Philippine Islands.\u00a0 In the case of Ngo-Ti <i>vs.<\/i> W. Morgan Shuster, Collector of Customs (7 Phil. Rep., 355), the court, in discussing the precise question presented here, says (p. 358):<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"The principal and important question, whether the decision of the\u00a0 administrative officers is final or not upon question of citizenship has, we think, been decided in the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Ju-Toy (198 U. S., 253).\u00a0 In that case the court said:<br\/><br\/>\" 'It is established, as we have said, that the act purports to make the decision of the Department final, whatever the ground on which the right to enter the country is claimed, as well when it is citizenship as when it is domicile, and the belonging to a class excepted from the exclusion acts.\u00a0 * * * If, for the purpose of argument, we assume that the fifth amendment applies to him, and that to deny entrance to a citizen is to deprive him of liberty, we, nevertheless, are of opinion that with regard to him due process of law does not require judicial trial.'<br\/><br\/>\"In the case of Pearson <i>vs<\/i>. Williams (202 U. S., 281), the court said at page 286 :<br\/><br\/>\" 'But the matter which was before the mind of Congress presumably was that which had been before it on the former occasion, which had been the subject of judicial discussion (Lem Moon Sing <i>vs.<\/i> United States, 105 U. S., 538; Fok Yung Yo <i>vs.<\/i> United States,\u00a0 185 U. S., 296), and which was not quite disposed of until the last term of this court.\u00a0 (United States <i>vs.<\/i> Ju-Toy, 198\u00a0 U. S., 253.)'<br\/><br\/>\"According to this judgment, the decision of the administrative officers upon the question of citizenship is final where no abuse of authority of any kind on their part is alleged.\u00a0 There is no allegation of that character in this case.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>While an abuse of discretion and authority upon the part of the customs officials in the proceedings referred to is alleged by the plaintiff, no proof sustaining that allegation appears in the record.\u00a0 There is not a scintilla of evidence indicating that the customs officials in any way abused their authority or discretion.<br\/><br\/>As to the other contention of the plaintiff, viz, that, having been adopted by a person domiciled in the Philippine Islands, he himself thereupon became a citizen of the Philippine Islands in the sense that he was not subject to deportation but had a perfect right to remain here regardless of the conditions upon which he was allowed to land, I am of the opinion that that claim must also be disallowed.\u00a0 The status and right of the plaintiff to enter the Philippine Islands under the circumstances of this case are to be determined as of the time when he presented himself for entry and not by events that subsequently transpired.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Ju-Toy, 198 U. S., 253, 263.)\u00a0 If he was not entitled to land in the Philippine Islands of right at the time he was admitted under bond, he could not while in them under that bond do anything which would render valid and unconditional his original entry.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above expressed, the judgment of the lower court must be, and hereby is, affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Rep., 613.)<br\/><br\/>The defendants not having denied the execution of said promissory note, under oath, they admitted it, arid no evidence was therefore necessary on the part of the plaintiff to show that the defendants owed the amount claimed.\u00a0 The burden of proving the payment of the said promissory note, or any similar defense, was upon the defendants.\u00a0 (Knight <i>vs.<\/i> Whitmore, 125\u00a0 Cal., 198; McCormick Harvester Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Doucette, 61 Minn., 40.)<br\/><br\/>During the trial of the cause the defendants attempted to prove that the present promissory note had been paid by the substitution of another promissory note.\u00a0 The plaintiff admits that the defendants attempted to have the time of the payment of the promissory note in question extended by giving another promissory note in its stead.\u00a0 The plaintiff says that this proposal was refused by him.\u00a0 The plaintiff admits that the defendants paid upon the note in question the sum of P216.<br\/><br\/>The lower court allowed the plaintiff to recover on the said promissory note the difference between the original note of P3,500 and the amount of the payment, P216, or the balance of P3,284, with interest at 12 per cent.\u00a0 The objection is made in this court that the lower court had no authority to allow interest upon the amount due upon said promissory note, for the reason that said note did not contain any\u00a0 provision for interest.\u00a0 During the trial the plaintiff testified that there was an agreement between the parties to said promissory note that the defendants should pay interest at the rate of 12 per cent from the date of said note until the same was paid, and one of the defendants during the trial admitted that he had actually paid interest on said note, and it was agreed that\u00a0 interest upon said note had been paid up to and including the 13th day of May, 1908.\u00a0 The lower court based his right to allow interest upon the note in question upon the provisions of article 1108 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 Said article is as follows;<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Should the obligation consist in the payment of a sum of money, and the debtor should be in default, the indemnity for losses and damages, should there not be a stipulation to the contrary, shall consist in the payment of the interest agreed upon, and should there be no agreement, in that of the legal interest.\"<\/blockquote><br\/><br\/>In the present case an express agreement was proven on the part of the plaintiff and was admitted by the defendants by their having actually paid interest on the said contract.<br\/><br\/>The defendants made the further objection that the plaintiff had no authority to loan money upon promissory notes, and therefore had no authority to bring an action upon such notes.\u00a0 The defendants, however, accepting the money represented by said promissory note from the plaintiff, and entering into the said contract, are thereby estopped now from denying the authority of the plaintiff to make such a contract.\u00a0 (Sec. 333 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions; Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Rosatzin, 5 Phil. Rep., 660.)\u00a0 In the present action the plaintiff proved that it was a corporation duly organized under the laws in force in the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>There are many cases bearing upon this subject, and the distinction should always be borne in mind, if it does not always appear, between a pretended corporation or a corporate entity, one\u00a0 having no existence in fact, and one illegally organized or which may have forfeited its charter.\u00a0 The question whether the entity contracted with is an entity organized by law is one which can not be raised by one who has dealt with it and recognized its existence, for the purpose of defeating a liability growing out of such contractual relation between himself and such entity.\u00a0 When one makes a contract with a plaintiff under a corporate name, he is estopped from denying its corporate existence.\u00a0 (Connecticut Bank <i>vs.<\/i> Smith,. 17 How.

I.<br\/><br\/>\"II.\u00a0 The defendant is likewise another corporation organized under the laws in force in these Islands.<br\/><br\/>\"III.\u00a0 The plaintiff, as such corporation sole, is the administrator of the temporalities of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church in the Archdiocese of Manila.<br\/><br\/>\"IV.\u00a0 The municipality of Rosario, Province of Batangas, is comprised within the said Archdiocese\u00a0 of Manila.<br\/><br\/>\"V.\u00a0 The Roman Catholic Apostolic Church is the owner of a rural estate devoted to the cultivation of rice and described as follows:\u00a0 Bounded on the N. by the land of Leonida Suno and Eugenio Maguita; on the S. by that of Sixto Rojas and Mariano Goyena; on the E. by that of Juan Gatchalian and Norberto Inandan and the Bantoc River; and on the W. by that of, the said Mariano\u00a0 Goyena and the Tumbol River; with a capacity of approximately 25<i> cavanes<\/i> of seed.<br\/><br\/>\"VI.\u00a0 The defendant entity appropriated to itself nearly seven years ago the above-described land, and is in possession thereof, and alleges to have title to and interest in the said rural estate.<br\/><br\/>\"VII.\u00a0 The church has been deprived ever since from receiving the fruits of the said land which were destined for the maintenance of the parish curate of said municipality, and which amounts approximately to the sum of P1,500, Philippine currency.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, the plaintiff prays the court to enter judgment against the defendant municipality, or to hold that the land described in this complaint is the property of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, and that the defendant has no title or interest therein whatsoever; and at the same time that the latter be ordered to make restitution of the possession of the said land to the plaintiff, and to pay him the sum of P1,500 for fruits received, with the costs against the said defendant, or to grant to the plaintiff any other remedy which the court may deem to be in accordance with the law.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>On the 27th day of December, 1907, the defendant filed the following answer:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"I.\u00a0 That it denies that the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church is the owner of the rural property described in Paragraph V of the complaint, inasmuch as it is the property of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>\"II.\u00a0 That as the defendant is the owner of the land in question he can hardly have appropriated it as alleged in Paragraph VI of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>\"III.\u00a0 That the defendant municipality has granted the usufruct of the land in question to the\u00a0 parish curate of the same for his maintenance; but as for the last seven years no parish curate has been stationed in said municipality, the said right, mistaken for that of ownership, has lapsed.<br\/><br\/>\"IV.\u00a0 That in view thereof the defendant prays the court to absolve him of the complaint with costs.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>After hearing the evidence adduced during\u00a0 the trial of the cause, the lower court rendered the following decision, after having made a resume\" of the proof:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Before the plaintiff could recover absolutely these lands, they, must show title and possession.\u00a0 They show none.\u00a0 Their only witness to show occupation says that the laymen were administering the land while he was on it, claiming to be the tenant of the plaintiff or its authorized agent.\u00a0 It is much more plainly shown that the laymen have administered the lands in dispute for a long period of years, except four or five years, when one of the curates refused to allow the laymen to have anything to do with them.\u00a0 It is certain that the laymen, after this curate's time, again took up the administration of the lands, for they returned them to the municipality, being no longer able, by reason of the unsettled condition of affairs in this country, to administer them.\u00a0 The one witness for the plaintiff says he left the land about 1896, about two years after the justice of the peace said one of the curates took out a possessory information, and even while this witness, Melecio, was on the lands as a tenant, he says, of the curate, these laymen, he says, were the administrators of the land also.\u00a0 The plaintiff has failed to show any right of title or possession to the lands in dispute, and the defendant should not be disturbed in its possession.\u00a0 Therefore I find for the defendant, with the costs of the suit.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>From this decision of the lower court, the plaintiff, after having excepted thereto, and after having made a motion for &amp; new trial based upon the grounds that the judgment was contrary to the weight of the evidence, appealed to this court and made the following assignments of error:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"1. Because the evidence shows that the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, by means of its representatives, had been in possession of the land in question from time immemorial until the insurrection;<br\/><br\/>\"2. Because the defense interposed by the defendant in his answer to the complaint is not substantiated by the evidence; and<br\/><br\/>\"3. Because the evidence shows that the defendant had no right or interest therein whatsoever before he seized the land in question.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>At the time the cause was called for trial in the Court of First Instance, the attorney for the plaintiff made the following statement, supposedly for the purpose of laying a foundation for proof of the contents of certain documents, in accordance with the provisions of section 321 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Before preparing this case I went to Rosario to hunt evidence.\u00a0 I inquired of several curates if they still had titles to these lands, and was told that during the revolution the church at Rosario was burned down and all of the records lost.\u00a0 I found no one who knew where the title was.\u00a0 I searched in the archives of the Archbishopric of Manila for documents and found some about Rosario, but none about the title to the lands in Rosario.\u00a0 He then said that no title could be found, but was lost.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>With reference to the first assignment of error, to, wit, that the proof shows that the plaintiff, by means of its representatives, had been in possession of the land in question from time\u00a0 immemorial up to the time of the revolution, the proof seems to show, beyond question, that this is true.\u00a0 The evidence adduced during the trial on this particular question is as follows:<br\/><br\/>Juan Magtibay, a witness called for the plaintiff, said that he was 51 years of age and a farmer; that he had been a justice of the peace of the pueblo of Rosario for a period from 1892 to 1895; that he knew the priest of Rosario; that the priest obtained a possessory information for the lands in question; that the possessory information had been taken in the name of the priest Mariano Pe\u00f1a; that the possessory information had been taken in the name of the priest Mariano Pe\u00f1a for the reason that the land belonged to the parish.<br\/><br\/>Upon cross-examination the same witness testified that Mariano Pena had been the priest of the said pueblo for about eight years; that the priest, Mariano, administered the said land; that he saw\u00a0 the fruits of the land in the convent of the church; that the municipality of Rosario was now in possession of the land.<br\/><br\/>Melecio Delgado, a witness called for the plaintiff, testified that he was 56 years of age and had cultivated the land in question for sixteen years; that <i>he got permission to cultivate the land from the priest Pedro Catalan<\/i>; that he gave one-half of the products of the land to the priest while he cultivated the same and that he did not remember when the priest Pedro Catalan left the pueblo; that he had <i>always heard that the land belonged to the Church<\/i>; that he had seen the members of the cofradia working the land; that the <i>members of the cofradia were the ones sent by the priest to the land at the time the harvest was to be divided;<\/i> that he had been acquainted with the land before the time of the priest Pedro Catalan, during the time of the priest Pedro Leybas; that he carried the products of<br\/>the land to the convent; that he understood that <i>any priest who was in charge of the church administered the land and took the products; that the priest had administered the lands since the witness was a boy;<\/i> that the land in question is now in the possession of the municipality of Rosario.<br\/><br\/>Pedro Launcing, a witness called for the defendant, testified that he was 59 years of age; that he knew the land which was claimed by the Catholic Church; <i>that he had known the land since the time he had use of his reason, because it bounded the land of his father;<\/i> that on the second Sunday in October of each year there was a <i>fiesta<\/i> of the <i>cofradia<\/i> and the <i>products of the land were used there;<\/i> that those who administrated the property were the twelve members (of the <i>cofradia<\/i>); <i>that the product was carried to the convent,<\/i> because it was used as a depot or storehouse for the product; that these members (<i>Hermano Mayor<\/i>) always administered and cared for these products; <i>that they administered the land for thirty years, and when the revolution came the lands were delivered to some of the revolutionists;<\/i> that he knew the priest Pedro Catalan and the priest Mariano Pena, who succeeded him; that the only thing he knew was that these twelve members administered the land and carried the products to the convent; that the products of the land, according to his understanding and according to what everybody in the town said, were used for the <i>cofradia<\/i> and for the vestments of the Holy Virgin and the wagon floats used in the processions; that in the time of the priest Leybas the products were also used for those who worked about the church; that the twelve members were a kind of helpers to the priest to get the <i>fiesta<\/i> ready; that they could not dispose of the products without the consent of the priest; that in the time of the priest Leybas the members administered the land, <i>but when the priest Catalan came he refused to let the members have anything to\u00a0 do with it<\/i>; that the priest Leybas took the products from the members or they were carried to the convent by them and in this way he became connected with the administration; that the\u00a0 products were used for the <i>fiesta.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Florencio Velasco, a witness for the defendant, was called and testified that he was 44 years of age and that he had known the land in question as long as he could remember; that the members (<i>Hermano Mayor<\/i>) had possession of the land when he first knew it; that the members (<i>Hermano Mayor<\/i>) were then all dead; that they made use of the land to sustain the <i>fiestas<\/i> and for the food of the people at the <i>fiesta<\/i> of the <i>cofradia<\/i>; that the\u00a0 priests administered the land; that the products from the land were taken to the convent to be disposed of by the twelve members.<br\/><br\/>Anastasio Recto was called as a witness for the defendant, and testified that he was 55 years of age and a farmer; <i>that he had known the land in dispute since he was 12 or 13 years of age<\/i>; that when he was 12 years old he was studying with the priest of the church; that he saw in the warehouse of the convent some rice which had been harvested upon the land in question; that in those times the authorities supported twelve of the oldest and most honest men to administer the land; that the priest Leybas was the priest at that time; that he left the town of Rosario in 1870 for fifteen years; that he began to study with the priest Cipriano Tomas in 1866; he returned to Rosario in 1885 and Pedro Catalan was priest then.<br\/><br\/>It would seem clear that from this testimony the church had been in possession of the land in question through its priests, its representatives in the municipality, for a period as long back as any of the witnesses could remember, covering a period certainly from forty to fifty years.\u00a0 There was no proof to show that any other person or entity had been in possession of the land before that time, excepting the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the second assignment of error, to wit, that the defense interposed by the defendant in its answer was not sustained by the proof, it will be remembered that the defendant alleged that <i>it was the owner of the land in question<\/i> and the only proof introduced by the defendant during the trial to sustain that allegation <i>was proof to the effect that it had been in possession of the land in question only from the time of the insurrection<\/i> (some time between 1896 and 1898).<br\/><br\/>The defendant introduced no documents to support its claim of ownership.\u00a0 The proof shows that the defendant obtained possession of the land in question, after the priest in charge of the church had left the municipality by reason of the insurrection, from the tenant of the land, and that the tenant who delivered the land to the defendant was, and had been for several years prior thereto, the tenant representing the priest of the parish in the management and cultivation of the said land.\u00a0 At the time the tenant turned the land over to the defendant he said that by reason of the insurrection then existing in the country, he could not remain upon the land longer, evidently believing that the municipality or the president of the municipality would be able to protect the property, thereby saving to the church its vested rights.<br\/><br\/>The result of the proof then seems to us to be clear that-<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 The plaintiff, by its representatives, the parish priest of the <i>pueblo<\/i> of Rosario, had been in possession and control of the land in question for a time immemorial.\u00a0 No person seems to have been found in the <i>pueblo<\/i> who could remember when the land in question had been in the possession of any other person or entity;<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That the parish priests had been obliged to leave the municipality of Rosario by reason of the existence of an insurrection and thereby were obliged to give up the actual possession and control of their lands and property; and<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 That under these circumstances and during the enforced absence of the real possessor of the property, the defendant obtained possession.<br\/><br\/>The question presented by these facts is, Can the defendant, having obtained possession of the land under these circumstances, continue to keep the plaintiff out of the possession of the property, the period of prescription not having run?\u00a0 Did the plaintiff, by reason of being driven out of the municipality, lose its right to its property or to the possession of the same?\u00a0 Suppose, for example, that the defendant, the municipality, had driven the plaintiff out of the possession of the property in question, and without any further right than the mere possession of the property, could it maintain its possession against the plaintiff in an action properly brought in the courts?\u00a0 It is not believed that the courts or the Government will permit one person to forcibly take possession of the property of another by intimidation and then retain the possession as against the person driven out, if the latter seeks to enforce his right within the period prescribed by law.\u00a0 The right to be repossessed of the property, under these conditions, does not depend upon whether one or the other is the owner of the property.\u00a0 The action is one to recover a right which had been temporarily lost by force and intimidation.\u00a0 If the action had been brought\u00a0 within a period of one year, then it should have been brought in the court of the justice of the peace.\u00a0 If it is not brought until after the expiration of one year, then it must be brought in the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 (Espiritu <i>vs.<\/i> Deseo, 1 Phil. Rep., 225; Simpao <i>vs.<\/i> Dizon, 1 Phil. Rep., 261; Alonso <i>vs.<\/i> The Municipality of Placer, 5 Phil. Rep., 71.)<br\/><br\/>Every possessor of property is entitled to be respected in his possession and to be protected therein or restored there to by the means established by law when he is by force or intimidation deprived of his possession.\u00a0 (Endencia <i>vs.<\/i> Loalhati, 9 Phil. Rep., 177.)<br\/><br\/>In an action to obtain the possession of property lost under the circumstances in the present case, the question of ownership is not one of importance.\u00a0 (Ty Laco Cioco <i>vs.<\/i> Muro, 9 Phil. Rep., 100.)<br\/><br\/>One who has been improperly and by force and intimidation deprived\u00a0 of the possession of real property, can recover such possession if the action is brought within the period prescribed by law, and before some other person or persons have acquired title thereto by\u00a0 prescription.\u00a0 (Barlin <i>vs.<\/i> Ramirez, 7 Phil. Rep., 41.)<br\/><br\/>A question very analogous to the question presented in the present\u00a0 case was presented to this court in the case of The Bishop of Cebu <i>vs.<\/i> Mangaron (6 Phil. Rep., 286.)\u00a0 In that case this court discussed at length the form of an action existing prior to the present Code of Procedure in Civil Actions and held, in effect, that one who had been in possession of real property for a period of twenty years, more or less, and who had been illegally deprived of such possession, could properly maintain, under the provisions of the present Code of Procedure, an action for the possession of such property.\u00a0 We deem it unnecessary here to repeat the discussions with reference to the former practice found in that case.\u00a0 It is sufficient to say that the doctrine established in the case of The Bishop of Cebu <i>vs.<\/i> Mangaron, with reference to the right of one who has been deprived of the possession of this property by force and intimidation, may maintain an action for the possession of such property as against any one who may be found possessing the same.<br\/><br\/>We believe by virtue of our conclusions with reference to the first and second assignment of error, that it is unnecessary to discuss the third assignment of error made by the appellant.<br\/><br\/>Our conclusion is, therefore, that in view of the facts and circumstances of the present case, and in view of the fact that the plaintiff had been in possession of the land in question for an\u00a0 immemorial period, and in view of the fact that it had been driven out by forces over which it had no control, and in view of the fact that the defendant went into possession after the plaintiff had been so driven out, and without discussing the question whether the plaintiff or the defendant is the real owner, of the property in question, that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of the property described in the fifth paragraph of the complaint, above quoted, and that, therefore, the judgment of the lower court is hereby reversed, and without any finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

That on March 22, 1905, Benito Nova sold to Macario Samson, for the sum of P350, two parcels of land, one of which, the first one described in the document, according to the agreed statement of facts, is the subject-matter of the complaint.\u00a0 It was expressly stipulated in the contract that the purchaser, and his heirs and assigns became the owners of the above-mentioned lands by virtue of this sale, they being entitled to exercise the rights pertaining to them as owners. It was also expressly stipulated that, at any time the seller should repay the amount received, the said lands would be returned to him, provided not more than three months after each crop had elapsed.\u00a0 This contract was ratified before a notary on the same date.<br\/><br\/>(2) That on May 12, 1906, the said Benito Nova sold to Saturnino Nery, for P900, the two parcels of land which had been sold on <i>pacto de retro<\/i> to Macario Samson, in accordance with the foregoing document, this sale being absolute, and the following declaration of the seller being set up in the deed, viz, that the said lands were sold on <i>pacto de retro<\/i> to Macario Samson, under a deed executed on March 22, 1905, and that they were redeemed by the purchaser Nery; that they are not encumbered, and he binds himself to answer to any claim that may be presented, as well as to be responsible for the eviction and warranty.\u00a0 This deed also was ratified before a notary public on the same date.<br\/><br\/>(3) That, at the foot of the foregoing document of sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> in favor of Macario Samson, there is the following note:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"I indorse this document in favor of Saturnino Nery, on account of the above-mentioned lands having been redeemed.-Camalig, May 12, 1906.-Macario Samson.-Signed in the presence of Benito Nova and another witness.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/><br\/>(4) That on June 7, 1905, the said Benito Nova pledged the land in question to Bernabe Alcera for the sum of P300, under the following conditions:\u00a0 that the period fixed for the redemption should be eighteen months from that date, but, should this period elapse without the redemption being effected, the pledge was to continue for a further period of eighteen months.\u00a0 There is also the following clause:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"I hereby declare that the said <i>late<\/i> (field) is pledged from this date forward to my creditor, and he is the one who has the right to collect the fruits thereof until such time as I redeem it; I also declare that, at the expiration of the period fixed, I will redeem the said land, and he shall not make any objection, provided the amount is in order and the period has expired.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>This document, executed in the Bicol dialect, is purely a private one.<br\/><br\/>(5) On August 31,1906, the said Benito Nova sold with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, to Bernabe Alcera, the land here in question, for the sum of P300 and for the period of eighteen months from June 7,1905, the date on which he received the money, according to a document in Bicol attached to the deed, and he, on that date, still claimed that the land was his exclusive property, and both of the parties agreed in the deed that, upon the payment of the sum of P300, Bernabe Alcera was to be the absolute owner of the property described until the date fixed for the redemption in the said deed, and that he might exercise his right to transfer the same to a third party.<br\/><br\/>If we note the context of the deeds, the land was apparently delivered to Alcera on June 7, 1905, but on the other hand it appears that, inasmuch as it was redeemed on May 12, 1906, it ought to have been in Samson's possession from the month of March; and, since it is claimed from Nery in this suit, it must at present be in the possession of the latter.\u00a0 Bernabe Alcera claimed it on March 18, 1907, pretending to be the owner thereof.<br\/><br\/>The parties set out the facts in the contention in an agreement that was produced at the trial.\u00a0 Therein appears an article (the 8th), of the following tenor:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"That the fruits collected by the defendant from the land in question amount to the sum of P30.\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>By virtue of the agreement, there were introduced and admitted the following documents:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Evidence of the plaintiff:\u00a0 Exhibit A, with a translation into Spanish, which is a deed of the land in controversy executed by Benito Nova in favor of the plaintiff; Exhibit B, which is another deed of the same land executed by the said Benito Nova in favor of the plaintiff on the 31st day of August, 1906.\"<br\/><br\/>\"Evidence of the defendant:\u00a0 Exhibit No. 1, which is a document executed by Benito Nova in favor of Macario Samson, the first parcel of land therein described being the land in litigation; and Exhibit No. 2, which is another document executed by the said Benito Nova in favor of Saturnino \"Nery, the defendant, the first parcel of land therein described being the land in question, the same which had been sold to Macario Samson,\"<br\/><\/blockquote><br\/>By virtue of these proofs the Court of First Instance of Albay, on April 24, 1907, entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff holding that the ownership of the land, at the time of the filing of the complaint, belonged, and actually, now belongs, to said plaintiff, ordering that the possession thereof be restored by the defendant to the plaintiff, with the costs against the defendant.\u00a0 The latter appealed from this judgment, as did also the plaintiff in so far as it disregarded the payment of the sum of P30, as agreed, according to article 8 cited above.\u00a0 Tin's appeal is presented without the corresponding bill of exceptions.\u00a0 The appeal being now before us, we hold:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 That the land having been sold on March 22, 1905, to Macario Samson, although with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> in favor of the vendor, the ownership and possession of said land were transferred to the purchaser, inasmuch as the contract of purchase and sale transferred the ownership and possession of the thing sold and delivered.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 That from the date of the sale, the vendor Nova had only the right to repurchase the land, according to the conditions stipulated in the said contract of purchase and sale.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 That, therefore, the pledge of the land made by Nova to Alcera on June 7, 1905, before said land was repurchased from Samson, was not properly a contract of pledge, because the question at issue is one of realty, nor was it even valid as a mortgage, not being the property of the mortgagor, inasmuch as the then true owner was Samson.<br\/><br\/>Fourth.\u00a0 That Samson continued to be the owner of the land until the 12th of May, 1906, on which date Nery, by agreement with Nova, repurchased it from Samson; the right of repurchase in favor of Nova stipulated in the deed of March 22, 1905, thereupon became extinguished.<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 That the land being at once sold by Nova to Nery, the ownership thereof was transferred to Nery on the same day, May 12, 1906, by virtue of the contract of purchase and sale.<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 In consequence, Nova, on the 31st, of August, 1906, neither had land to sell nor any right of ownership that he might transfer to Alcera, as both of them appeared to believe when they executed the instrument of that date; the sale made by Nova is therefore of no effect or value, as he sold something which then was no longer his property.<br\/><br\/>Seventh.\u00a0 If the object of the document executed by Nova on June 7, 1905, in favor of Alcera, instead of being a pledge or mortgage had been the sale of his right to repurchase stipulated with Samson on March 22, 1905, its effect would have been to nullify the repurchase and the absolute sale effected by Nova on May 12, 1906, in favor of Nery, as an act and a contract executed by one who, in 1906, no longer had either a right to repurchase, or a right to sell, because he had parted with such rights in 1905.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, he who was defrauded by the contracts of June 7, 1905, and August 31, 1906, was Alcera, who accepted as security, and later under a sale with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, land which on that date did not belong to Nova, and he can not blame anyone else for his own fault.<br\/><br\/>By virtue thereof, with an entire reversal of the judgment appealed from, we absolve the defendant from the complaint, and hold that he is entitled to the ownership and the possession of the land in question.\u00a0 The plaintiff is sentenced to pay the costs of first instance, without any special ruling as to costs in this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Willard<\/i>, and <i>Tracey, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

and that during that period the band committed a number of heinous offenses, among others the kidnaping and murder of one Francisco Ambas and his son Martin, and the sacking of the town of Alabat, in the course of which the brigands murdered in cold blood one Gerardo Afable, the municipal justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/>The defendant testifying in his own behalf admitted his affiliation with the band, so that, there can be no doubt of his guilt of the crime of which he was convicted; and the only question for consideration is whether the sentence of death imposed by the trial court is the just and appropriate penalty for that crime.<br\/><br\/>The penalty prescribed by law is from twenty years' imprisonment to death, but this court has uniformly declined to affirm the imposition of capital punishment upon persons convicted of the crime of brigandage, unless the record disclosed, beyond a reasonable doubt, either that the convict, while a member of a band of brigands, had\u00a0 taken an individual part in the commission of some heinous offense, or that he had been the chief or a subchief of a band at a time when the brigands under his command committed such an offense.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, testifying in his own behalf, swore that he had had no direct participation in the commission of the above-mentioned murders, and that he was at no time in command of the band of which he was a member, being at all times subject to the orders of its chief; but the evidence of record leaves no room for doubt that, with his own hand and in cold blood, he slew the justice of the peace of Alabat, and that on that occasion and also when Ambas and his son were kidnaped he was either a chief or subchief of the band, actively in command of the brigands who participated in the commission of these crimes.<br\/><br\/>Four witnesses testified as to the assault on the town of Alabat, and the circumstances under which\u00a0 the justice of the peace of that town was murdered.\u00a0 Two of these, the wife and niece of the murdered man, saw him done to death; and the other two, on the night of the murder, heard the defendant boasting to his companions that he, personally, together with his men, had committed the crime.<br\/><br\/>Almacha Tajabo testified that about 6 o'clock of the evening during which the town of Alabat was sacked, the defendant and two other strange men presented themselves in the room of her house where she was sitting with her husband; that the defendant ordered his companions to bind her husband; that the three then assaulted him with bolos, inflicting fatal wounds in his head and body, and threw the corpse in a large box outside the house; that afterwards they ransacked and robbed the house, threatening the inmates with death if they made a move.<br\/><br\/>Martina Azuela, a niece of the murdered man, corroborated the testimony of her aunt in all its essential details, and both these witnesses identified the accused as the leader of the party which entered their house on that occasion, with such certainty, and so clearly and positively as to leave no room for doubt in the mind of the trial court, or in ours, as to the truth and accuracy of their statements.<br\/><br\/>Vicente Francia testified\u00a0 that he was <i>presidente<\/i> of the town of Alabat at the time when it was sacked; that on that occasion he was seized, bound, and carried into the street by one of the parties, into which the brigands separated after they\u00a0 entered the town; that about three hours afterwards the defendant Vargas came up to the place where the witness was held a prisoner and ordered that he be brought to the <i>presidencia<\/i> or municipal building; that when they arrived there the defendant said to him,\u00a0 among other things:\u00a0 \"We have killed your justice of the peace, because he was a man of bad character,\" adding, as he showed the witness his bolo, \"You can see the blood still dropping.\"<br\/><br\/>Dolores Nava de Angeles testified that at the time of the sack of Alabat her husband was <i>presidente<\/i>-elect of the town; that he escaped from the house before the robbers arrived; that when they entered they ordered her outside with instructions to say her prayers; that on her return to the house, the defendant, Melecio Vargas, told her that he was <i>comandante<\/i> of the band, and among other things said:\u00a0 \"You should pray for the justice of the peace because we have killed him.\"<br\/><br\/>Three witnesses described in detail the kidnaping on the 12th day of February, 1904, of Francisco Ambas and his son by a party of ten armed brigands, acting under the joint orders of the defendant\u00a0 (who was addressed by his followers with the title <i>comandante<\/i>) and another brigand called Cabayo.<br\/><br\/>Aleja Amado, the widow of Francisco Ambas, and Graciana Leyman, the\u00a0 widow of his son Martin, described in detail how this party of brigands seized their husbands in the house of one Doroteo Maravit, brought them bound to their own house, which was sacked and robbed, and later sailed away in a boat with their booty and their prisoners who were never seen again alive by the witnesses.\u00a0\u00a0 These witnesses also testified that sometime afterwards they were called to Daet in North Camarines to identify two skulls which the justice of the peace of that town exhibited to them as a part of the remains of two unknown persons who were believed to have come to their death by violence; that one of these skulls bore a marked indentation of such size, shape, and location, that the witnesses were\u00a0 satisfied that it was the skull of Francisco Ambas whose head was similarly marked, and that the peculiar filing of the teeth in the other skull proved it to be the skull of Martin Ambas.<br\/><br\/>Doroteo Maravit, from whose house these victims of the band were kidnaped, also described the details of the commission of that crime, adding that he himself had been compelled to aid the robbers in carrying the property stolen from the house of Francisco Ambas and his son to the boat in which the robbers made their escape.\u00a0 This witness, who knew the defendant by sight prior to the kidnaping, definitely and\u00a0 positively identified him as one\u00a0 of the band of about ten armed brigands who committed the crime.<br\/><br\/>Two other witnesses for the prosecution, Juan Tolinto and Modesto Pamiliran, who themselves had been kidnaped by the brigands and held prisoners for some weeks, testified that in the brigand camp the defendant was always addressed and spoken of by his companions as the <i>comandante<\/i>, and that he it was who gave orders there.<br\/><br\/>In the light of the foregoing testimony no credence can be given to the statements of the accused, who swore that he was not present at the time when Francisco Ambas and his son are said to have been kidnaped, and that while it is true that he was one of the band which sacked the town of Alabat, he was not present when the justice of the peace was killed, and was not in command on that occasion, being no more than a mere soldier under the orders of his chief who was called Cabayo.<br\/><br\/>In our opinion the evidence of record proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant directly participated in the assassination of the justice of the peace\u00a0 of Alabat and in the kidnaping of Francisco Ambas and his son; and that, if he was not the supreme chief of the band of which he was a member, he was one of the subchiefs in active command of a portion of the band at a time when the parties under his command were engaged in the commission of heinous offenses.\u00a0 We find no errors in the proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the accused, and the sentence of death imposed by the trial court should be, and is hereby, affirmed with the costs of these proceedings against the defendant,<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

THE CITY OP MANILA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 21st of March, 1905, counsel for the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos filed a written complaint against the city of Manila, claiming the refund of the sum of P88,698, illegally collected from said company, together with legal interest thereon from April 13, 1904, until the same should be settled; the company also claimed the return of P45,746.97, with legal interest thereon, which it had paid in excess taxes; at the close of the trial, the Court of First Instance rendered judgment on the 11th of September of said year, and sentenced the defendant city of Manila to refund the first-mentioned amount, with legal interest thereon from the date of the complaint with the costs; as to the second amount claimed, the defendant was absolved, because it was not shown that the plaintiff had paid it to the defendant city.<br\/><br\/>The defendant excepted to the above judgment, and this court, on February 14,1907, reversed the same and directed that a new trial be held in order that the plaintiff might prove which portion of the so-called illegal taxes had been actually collected and received by the city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>The case was reopened, and the new trial held in the court below on the 5th of June, 1907; the testimony of witnesses was taken, and the documents marked A, B, C, D, and E, exhibited by the plaintiff, to which the adverse party objected, were made of record, and the trial judge, rendered a new judgment on the 28th of September, 1907, ordering the city of Manila to pay the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos the sum of P88,698 with legal interest thereon from the 13th of April, 1904, and costs.\u00a0 To said judgment the defendant excepted and in addition moved for a new trial; the motion being overruled, the petitioner also excepted, and the bill of exceptions was presented and approved on the 22d of October, 1907,<br\/><br\/>In order to be able to declare as unjust the collection and payment of the sum of P88,698, the refund of which is herein claimed, it becomes necessary to ascertain whether the plaintiff company did unduly, and for a second time pay the said amount after having already paid it or whether it was compelled to do so without the existence of any legal provision authorizing such collection, or to compel it to pay the same, either as a tax on its profits, or as an industrial tax.<br\/><br\/>The matter at issue is the industrial tax established in this country under the general regulation approved by the royal order of June 19, 1890, which regulation, together with its tariffs, was enforced until the 1st of July, 1904, when it was repealed by Act No. 1189 7of the Commission, dated July 2 of the said year; and based on the provisions of the said regulation, the return of that sum, which the plaintiff company had paid as a tax of 5 per cent on the profits of its business during the years 1901, 1902, and 1903, is demanded in the complaint.\u00a0 The action is brought against the city of Manila, notwithstanding the fact that the amount was paid to the Collector of Internal Revenue, or the <i>Administrador de Hacienda Publica<\/i> for the reason that the money was turned over to the municipal treasury of Manila.<br\/><br\/>It is absolutely necessary for the proper settlement of this litigation, that it be effectively shown that, according to the terms and provisions of the aforesaid regulation, the taxes denominated therein as industrial, <i>urbana<\/i>, and tax on profits, are separate and entirely distinct taxes, involving diverse conceptions and meanings in their administrative economic consequences and effects, without it being possible ever to confuse them or mistake the one for the other, because the taxpayer, who is compelled to pay one or all of them, can in no manner evade their imposition and payment by \"computation,'y except in the manner prescribed and authorized by the said regulation.<br\/><br\/>The generic denomination of the various taxes therein established is industrial taxation, but the general conception of the tax does not exclude the diversity and special nature of its imposition on each of the various branches of industry, commerce, professions1, arts or occupation, according to their respective classification in the tariffs. (Articles 1 and 22 of the regulation.)<br\/><br\/>Although the 5 per cent tax on the net profits, which banks and joint-stock companies were obliged to pay, is a tax of an industrial character, it can not in any way be mistaken for the other industrial taxes mentioned in the general rules and enumerated in the tariffs.\u00a0 Hence, a taxpayer who has paid the said tax of 5 per cent can not allege exemption from payment of the industrial tax for carrying on the industry or commerce in which he is engaged.\u00a0 Article 23 6i the aforesaid general rules reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Unless otherwise provided for, the person carrying on in the same premises, shop or store, two or more industries trades or businesses included in the same\u00a0 tariff, will pay tax on the one subject to the higher rate; if the industries, trades or businesses should be governed by different tariffs, the taxpayer will be required to obtain a license for the highest taxable industry, trade or business, in each tariff, in which he may be engaged.<br\/><br\/>\"If the industries are carried on in separate stores, shops or premises, tax chargeable to the different industries will be collected, even if they should belong to the same tariff.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The plaintiff acknowledges that, as a joint-stock company, according to the said general rules, it was obliged to pay 5 per cent tax on the net profits distributed to its stockholders, in accordance with its respective balance sheets, under the provisions of paragraph 4 of tariff 1 of the industrial tax, the said company not being one of those exempted by No. 58 of the table of exemptions.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff also acknowledges that, as a corporation or a joint-stock company, it was under obligation to pay the tax indicated in the said tariff by reason of the commerce or industry carried on by it through its branch offices or agencies in the different provinces of this archie pelago, as prescribed in the respective tariff, class, number, rate and item.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff likewise acknowledges that it was obliged to pay the city tax (<i>contribucion urbana<\/i>), and subsequently, upon the abolishment of the latter by Act No. 183 of July 30, 1901, the land tax on the real estate in its possession, although, according to the note at foot of the said paragraph 4 of tariff 1, the city tax which banks and mercantile associations have paid on their realty, is to be computed as a part of the tax collectible on their dividends.<br\/><br\/>On these suppositions, what was the motive for the claim set up by the Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos against the city of Manila, into whose treasury the money was paid, and, as claimed, improperly paid?<br\/><br\/>The motive is, and this is the question set up by the plaintiff, that in its opinion, in the amount of the 5 per cent tax imposed upon its dividends, there should be computed, not only the total <i>urbana<\/i> tax, and subsequently the land tax paid in lieu thereof, but also the amount of the industrial tax paid by it in the provinces through its agencies or branch offices, alleging that, as a joint-stock company or corporation, it should pay but one tax only; that, therefore, in addition to the urbtma tax, the total industrial tax paid by it for carrying on commerce and industries in several provinces of the Archipelago should be computed in the 5 per cent paid on the net profits.\u00a0 The plaintiff has not cited any article of the regulation which authorizes this last computation.<br\/><br\/>Before proceeding further, and before inquiring whether or not the Compailia General de Tabacos has any legal foundation for its claim, it should be stated that the municipality of the city of Manila was only constituted and established on the 7th of August, 1901; therefore, the latter can not be held responsible for sums collected, although improperly, by its predecessor prior to that date, and that notwithstanding the fact that such sums were ultimately deposited in its treasury, the truth is that the money was actually paid to the <i>Administracion de Hacienda Publica<\/i> or the Collector of Internal Revenue of Manila, upon an examination of the annual reports, accounts, and balance sheets of the taxpaying company, without any intervention on the part of the municipality. (Article 36 of the General Rules.)<br\/><br\/>Upon an examination of the one hundred and eleven articles of this regulation, the only law applicable in this case, the seven tariffs with their respective explanations, and the table of exemptions attached to the said regulation, we fail to find anything which provides either explicitly or by implication for the alleged computation of the total amount of the industrial tax paid by the plaintiff company in tlie 5 per cent tax on the net profits to its stockholders, so that the said company should pay the Government but one sole tax which is the 5 per cent tax alluded to and that as, according to the law, the city tax and subsequently the land tax was also computable in this tax, by a wide and liberal interpretation of the regulation this new tax should also be computed in the aforesaid tax of 5 per centum.<br\/><br\/>The theory of a sole tax probably pursued by the plaintiff, dreamed of by some of the economists and financiers of the civilized world, does not appear to have been adopted in any part of the said regulation of which articles 8, 13, 23, 24, 29, and others, and the tariffs annexed thereto fully demonstrate the system established of compelling the different manifestations of commerce, industry, art, profession or occupation not included in the table of exemptions, to sustain the burdens of the government.<br\/><br\/>If the only law that governs this case does not authorize the computation of the industrial tax in the amount of the 5 per cent tax imposed upon dividends to be divided among the partners, which is the theory advanced by the plaintiff, as expressly provided in reference to the city tax, there is no legal authority for acceding to the prayer of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>Even though the 5 per cent tax payable on dividends of companies or mercantile associations to which paragraph 4 of tariff 1 of the regulation refers was denominated an industrial tax, it would be no reason why the amount of the industrial tax paid by the same under different contributive items should be computed in said tax, because according to the said regulation, corporations or individuals in these Islands engaged in any industry, commerce, profession, art, or occupation not expressly exempted, were obliged to pay it.\u00a0 (Article 1 of the regulation. )<br\/><br\/>It is a proven fact, which the parties have admitted, that the plaintiff company paid into the <i>Administracion de Hacienda Publica de Manila<\/i> (internal revenue office), and not to the municipality, the sum of 88,698 pesos as a tax of 5 per cent on the net profits distributable among its stockholders, corresponding to the years 1901, 1902, and 1903; the collection was lawfully made in this city for the reason that the administration and management of the said company resided in this city, and because the law did not impose upon the company the obligation to liquidate and pay said tax of 5 per cent in the provinces, by means of its agencies, which would have been an absurdity.\u00a0 (Article 36 of the said regulation.)<br\/><br\/>In the said sum there should only be computed the 83,307.89 pesos which the plaintiff company paid first as <i>urbana<\/i> and later as land tax corresponding to the year 1901, 22,103.18 pesos; to the year 1902, 43,520.49 pesos; and to the year 1903, 17,684.22 pesos, the same being the only tax allowed by the regulation, according to the note at foot of No. 4 of tariff 1; the computation should, however, be now made upon liquidation by the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\u00a0 Under no consideration can the pretended computation of the amount paid as industrial tax in the total amount of the 5 per cent tax on dividends distributed among the stockholders of the plaintiff company be held to be in accordance with law, because there is no legal provision authorizing it.<br\/><br\/>This second computation is inexplicable and can not be reasonably inferred from the contents of the said regulation and its tariffs. Otherwise one sole tax would have been established, and the administration of the revenue would have been simpler, easier and more expeditious.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand the record does not show that any amount was illegally collected from the plaintiff by way of taxes.\u00a0 If no computation was made of the amount paid by it firstly as <i>urbana<\/i> and subsequently as land tax, as part of the tax due on its dividends, it was and is entitled to claim it and to obtain the refund thereof.<br\/><br\/>In order to arrive at this declaration of the only right that the plaintiff has, it is not necessary for this court to consider the modifications introduced by the laws in force enacted by the Commission with regard to the disposition of funds collected by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, for the reason that such action pertains to the Department of Finance, and the final settlement of this contention can easily be reached through the administration of the law by the Bureau of Internal Revenue from which the city received the amount whose return is now claimed.<br\/><br\/>Aside from this, it should be noted that in this decision, the deduction or computation of the total amount of the <i>urbana<\/i> or land tax paid by the plaintiff company on its real property, situated both in this city and in the provinces from the aggregate amount of the 5 per cent of the net profits of the company is considered to be in accordance with law, for the reason that the said 5 per cent tax comes from all the profits obtained in its general business throughout the Archipelago.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, by virtue of the considerations above set forth it is our opinion that it should be held, as we do hereby hold:\u00a0 First, that the amount of the industrial tax paid to the Administration by the Compa\u00f1a General de Tabacos can not be computed in the 5 per cent tax on its dividends; second, that the only tax that should be computed therein, according to the general rules approved by royal order of June 19, 1890, was the <i>urbana<\/i> (city tax), and later the land tax which substituted it; and third, that in the sum which is the basis of the complaint, and which is the aggregate of the 5 per cent tax on dividends, there should have been computed the <i>urbana<\/i> and land taxes paid and corresponding to the three years 1901, 1902, and 1903; and, in consequence thereof, we must and do hereby order the Municipal Board of the city of Manila to refund to the plaintiff company the sum of P83,307.89, Philippine currency, which should have been computed in the amount claimed, or deducted therefrom.\u00a0 The judgment appealed from is thus affirmed in so far as it agrees with this decision; no special ruling is made as to the costs of either instance.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Tracey, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/>WILLIARD, J., with whom concurs CARSON, J., dissenting:<br\/><br\/>In view of what was held in the previous decision rendered in this matter (7 PhiL Rep., 488)\u00a0 I believe that the only payments, to the deduction of which the plaintiff is entitled, are those made to the city of Manila by reason of taxes on its real property situated therein, to wit:\u00a0 P52,430.60.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><center style=\"font-weight: bold;\">DISSENTING<\/center><br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">ARELLANO, C. J., <\/span><br\/><br\/>The city of Manila, the defendant herein, was created with the personality and rights set forth in its organic law, Art No. 183 of Philippine Commission, enacted July 30, 1901, section 1.<br\/><br\/>Section 47 of said Act, which fixed the annual tax rate for the years 1901, 1902, and 1903, repealed the laws, general orders or regulations by virtue of which the <i>urbana<\/i> and the frontage tax were collected in the city of Manila; they were substituted by the land tax the rate of which was fixed for the three years before mentioned.\u00a0 By virtue of the said provision the plaintiff paid to the defendant P52,430.00 as land tax on its real property situated in the city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the <i>urbana<\/i> tax imposed during the Spanish regime, and which, as already stated, was substituted by the land tax, there existed the industrial tax, which continued in force until 1904, when it was likewise expressly repealed by section 138 of Act 1189, which instituted the internal revenue tax, and by Chapter XVI established the tax on commerce and industry which went into effect, as provided in said section 138, on the 1st of January, 1905.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff had up to that time paid its industrial taxes in accordance with the laws of the former Spanish sovereignty.\u00a0 And in accordance with the said laws the present question must of necessity be decided; it must be assumed that since 1899 until the end of 1904, there existed the form and manner of collecting said industrial tax imposed by the Spanish legislator.<br\/><br\/>The resume, as it appears in the conclusion of facts in judgment appealed from is undoubtedly correct, as the total amount of taxes paid by the plaintiff during those five years was:\u00a0 for <i>urbana<\/i> or city tax P84,541.93, and for land tax P44,928.02, that is in all P128,839.95. (B. of E., 10.)<br\/><br\/>Prior to 1899, that is to say during the former sovereignty, the industrial tax would have been paid in full into the Insular Treasury, because it was not paid, nor could it be paid into any provincial or municipal treasury, nor to that of the <i>ayuntamiento<\/i> of the city of Manila which could only receive the tax that it had established on the frontage of properties. This point is also beyond all controversy; the industrial tax was a general one, as may be seen in the royal decree creating it, dated June 14, 1878:<br\/><blockquote>\"Article 1. A direct tax is hereby created in the Philippine Islands on urban property which shall amount for the time being to 5 per cent of the net profits of each proprietor.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 2. Another direct tax is also hereby established and imposed on industry, commerce, professions and arts, which shall be assessed proportionally to the nature and importance of the profits obtained by the persons engaged therein, whether they be Spanish subjects or foreigners.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>But upon the advent of American sovereignty, from the year 1899, the plaintiff was required and compelled to pay in the provinces, and out of the said total of\u00a0 P128,839.95, P76,409.35 were paid in the provinces, and P52,430.60 to the city of Manila, as already stated.<br\/><br\/>After the above P52,430.60 had been paid to the city of Manila as land tax, it was discovered that the plaintiff had not paid anything as industrial tax, and, acting under the Spanish legislation still in force, on the 9th of April, 1904, the plaintiff was required to pay on account thereof the sum of P88,698 which is the subject matter of this controversy.\u00a0 Under the said legislation it established, as the first premise, that the dividends declared and distributed by the plaintiff company during the years 1901, 1902, and 1903 amounted to Pl,773,960; and, as the second premise, that the plaintiff company should pay five per cent of the profits declared and distributed in order to draw the conclusion that said five per cent amounted to the aforesaid P88,698.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff company proved by the payments already enumerated, that it had more than paid the industrial tax due for the years 1901, 1902, and 1903; because if the 5 per cent on the profits which it had to pay for the years 1901, 1902, and 1903 only amounted to P88,698, from the fact that it had paid P128,839.95 for the said years, it was evident that it had paid P40,145,95 in excess.<br\/><br\/>But the defendant turned a deaf ear to the claim; it insisted on its demand with the warning that the plaintiff company would be suspended in the exercise of its commerce and industry if it did not pay the amount demanded, and matters being in this condition, the plaintiff company made the payment under protest and immediately filed the present complaint, the object of which is the refund of the W8,694 improperly collected by the city of Manila according to the facts above set forth.<br\/><br\/>The legal provisions by which this contention should be decided is the regulation for the-application of the royal decree of June 14, 1878, 'previously cited, which was promulgated by another royal decree dated June 19, 1890, published in the \"Gaceta de Manila\" of the 26th of October of the same year.\u00a0 Paragraph 4 of tariff 1 reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"The following will pay 5 per cent of the clear profits distributed to their shareholders according to their respective balances:<br\/><br\/>\"1.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"2. Companies and mercantile societies, Spanish and foreign, agencies of the latter whether stock or insurance companies not excepted in article No. 58 of the exemption table, even if their business, mercantile enterprise or other operations be conducted as agencies or on commission.<br\/><br\/>\"Note.-The city tax which banks and mercantile associations included in the preceding paragraph have paid on the revenue of their propeBty, will be computed as a part of the tax collectible on their dividends.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>To the claim of the plaintiff company the defendant set up the two points of defense which it has sustained in this suit.<br\/><br\/>First, that the land tax, now existing and imposed by the present sovereign, can not be computed nor included in the Spanish industrial tax which continued in force during the years 1901,1902, and 1903.<br\/><br\/>And, second, that the industrial tax, paid by the plaintiff company in the provinces of this Archipelago during the three years mentioned above, can not be computed as that due by it in the city of Manila, the place of its corporate residence.<br\/><br\/>It is, therefore, concluded that the pretension of the defendant is, that besides the P128,839.95 the plaintiff should pay P88,694 or altogether P217,533.95; deducting from the said total only whatever amount it may have paid as strictly <i>urbana<\/i> tax to the <i>ayuntamiento<\/i> of the city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the first claim or defense, this court has already stated the conclusion of law in its former decision:<br\/><blockquote>\"It seems clear from the above-quoted provisions of said law that when banks and commercial associations have paid an industrial tax of 5 per cent upon the dividends declared, that they will thereby be relieved from the neces- sity of paying a <i>territorial<\/i> and an <i>urbana<\/i> tax.\u00a0 Therefore, under this law the plaintiff, being a commercial association, can not be required to pay more taxes in the form of <i>territorial<\/i> and <i>urbana<\/i> taxes after having paid an industrial tax in accordance with the above provisions of said industrial tax regulation.\"\u00a0 (7 Phil. Bep,, 488, 493.)<br\/><\/blockquote>But the plaintiff still insists in its brief that in this court's decision, the <i>urbana<\/i> and the territorial tax are confounded for the purposes of the computation provided for by the note to paragraph 4 of tariff 1 of the industrial tax regulations, and claims an essential difference between the two aforesaid taxes; First, that the former is levied on the income, and the latter on the value of the property; that the former was not imposed on rural property while the latter is; second, that in Spain the territorial tax was computed as the industrial tax according to a note analogous to that contained in the regulation in force in the Philippines, for the reason that the said territorial tax existed there, while here it does.not, the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">urbana<\/span> tax taking its place, and that even so there was yet a difference between the Spanish territorial tax and the American land tax established here, consisting in that the first is equivalent to the <i>urbana<\/i> because it is an impost which is levied on the income, while the second is an <i>ad valorem<\/i> tax on the capital that the property represents, not on the income or product thereof.<br\/><br\/>It is true that the <i>urbana<\/i> tax established in the Philippines was imposed on the net profits which, for said purpose, was regulated for each property owner in accordance with article 1 of the royal decree of June 14, 1878, cited above, which established the said tax for the first time in these Islands; and it is also true that said tax was designated in Spain as the territorial tax, and as such it was not brought to these Islands, the reason therefor being contained in the preamble of said royal decree which reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"And if in the manner of their establishment (the taxes created by this royal decree) they do not appear with all the characteristics of similar taxes in the peninsula; if the tax imposed on urban property does not cover agricultural wealth and cattle; if for the industrial tax our system here of distribution, licenses and bases of population is not at once adopted, the reason therefor will be found in the essential difference which exists between that country and the peninsula by reason of its origin, situation and social organization; in that the landed property there, for the purposes of taxation, has not yet the character of such property here; that while the tribute exists, a new tax can not be imposed on agriculture which is mostly (tarried on by the tax paying masses, and prudence counsels that, in the beginning, every reform should be made to conform to the habits and practices of the people of each country, as the best means to establish it, allowing time to gradually modify such habits in order that the form of taxation may be altered as experience may warrant.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This was said in 1878, but ever since the royal decree of May 19, 1893, organizing municipal governments, went into effect, which was the one in force at the advent of the new sovereignty, the tax on rural property, which every municipality could assess, had already been authorized; this tax consisted of a percentage on the <i>real value<\/i> of the property, whether it was under cultivation or not, which tax was to be fixed by the municipal tribunal, that is to say, a territorial tax the same as the one in force at the present time; and if the tax had been established in any municipality on real property belonging to a mercantile company that paid a percentage on distributable profits, the amount thereof would unquestionably have inured to the municipality in the form, manner and conditions under which the tax should be imposed and administered, but it is certain that if in the lowest, which was the <i>urbana<\/i>, computation was established as to the industrial tax, with regard to the highest, which was the territorial tax, which as may be seen was more cumbersome than in Spain, the same computation could not fail to exist, invoking for said effect as the settled rule of law the same Spanish legislation which admits such computation; otherwise, an agency or branch office in the Philippines would be more heavily taxed than the head or main office would be in Spain, while both were under the same dominion.\u00a0 This would be the question to be set up before the former sovereignty which would have decided it in accordance with the principles of its legislation.<br\/><br\/>As to the second defense the appellant insists on the provision of article 23 0f the Regulation of June 19, 1890, sustaining that the amount paid by the appellee in the provinces was by reason of the industries carried on therein, and that such payment as industrial tax is independent of the tax on profits distributed which consists, as already stated, of 5 per cent thereon; it thus claims a difference between the industrial tax for license and a tax on profits, as if the latter were not an industrial tax.\u00a0 The said article 23 of the Regulation of June 19, 1890, reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Unless otherwise provided for, the person carrying on in the same premises, shop or store, two or more industries, trades or businesses included in the same tariff, will pay tax on the one subject to the higher rate; if the industries, trades or businesses should be governed by different tariffs, the taxpayer will be required to obtain a license for the highest taxable industry, trade or business, in each tariff, in which he may be engaged.\u00a0 If the industries are carried on in separate stores, shops, or premises, tax chargeable to the different industries will be collected, even if they should belong to the same tariff.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is an admitted fact that what existed in the provinces were agencies or branch offices of the company, the present appellee, without it having been agreed upon or proven in any manner that any of such agencies or branch offices had carried on a different branch of industry for which a tax of a higher or different rate should have been paid; had such a thing been proven, there would have been no reason for the existence of this dissenting opinion.<br\/><br\/>If the only reason for setting aside the computation of the amount paid in the provinces, by Act No. 133, is the above-cited article 23 of the regulation of June 19, 1890, this separate opinion becomes imperative for the sake of the rule involved.\u00a0 It may be assumed that the regulation of June 19, 1890, was not the only one that was promulgated in order to enforce the royal decree of 1878 which established the industrial tax.<br\/><br\/>The first regulation was of January 30, 1880, and contains the same provision as that of the 23d that was inserted from the regulation of 1890:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 26.\u00a0 The highest rate of the tax shall be paid by the taxpayer carrying on in the same premises, etc.\"\u00a0 That is to say, two or more industries under the same tariff, or as many taxes as industries under different groups of tariffs, and even when they pertain to the same tariff if carried on in separate premises; and nevertheless, the second tariff reads as follows:\u00a0 \"The following shall pay 5 per cent of their net profits which, according to their respective balances, are for distribution among their shareholders, whatever may be the manner in which they were earned and the use to which the capital is put, and <i>whatever<\/i> may, also be the <i>class<\/i> of such profits:\u00a0 1st. * * * 2d. Joint stock companies of all kinds, <i>comanditarias<\/i> by shares, and insurance companies unless exempted under paragraph 50 of the table of exemptions, whether Spanish or foreign, or agencies thereof employing their capital in mercantile transactions whether on their own account or on commission as agents.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>And the regulation of February 28, 1887, contained the same precept as article 26 of the previous one:<br\/><blockquote>\"Article 25.\u00a0 Unless otherwise provided in the tariffs the highest rate of tax shall be paid by the taxpayer who may carry on in the same premises, etc.,\" almost identical with the text above stated; and moreover, in tariff 2, \"Tax on profits7' appears No. 3, more extensive and more explicit than the one transcribed from the foregoing regulation.\u00a0 It reads as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"Second.\u00a0 Five per cent of their net profits which according to their respective balances, are for distribution among their shareholders, <i>whatever<\/i> may be the form under which they were earned and the <i>employment<\/i> to which the capital is put, and <i>whatever may be the kind of such profits<\/i>, shall be paid by all mercantile associations, whether collective, anonymous, <i>comanditaria<\/i> or insurance companies not exempted in No. 50 of the table of Exemptions, Spanish or foreign, or agencies thereof engaged in <i>all kinds of<\/i> businesses or mercantile or industrial enterprises, whether conducted on their own account or on commission as agents.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Therefore, the existence of an article as article 23 in the regulation of 1890, or of article 25 in that of 1887, or of 26 in that of 1880, is no reason why it should be established as a conclusion of law that an anonymous mercantile association, in addition to the 5 per cent on net profits distributed to its shareholders, which it must pay in the place where it resides, shall pay separately for its agencies or branch offices in the provinces where the same may exist, as many licenses under the industrial tax as there are agencies.<br\/><br\/>It would be necessary to show that such agencies or branch offices, or as might be said, the company itself through its agencies or branch offices, carries on in different places various industries even though they belonged to one sole tariff.<br\/><br\/>There is not in the entire proceedings one fact and even less one item of proof with regard to these matters.\u00a0 Nor as to the fact that the amount collected in the provinces was not 5 per cent on the profits, but for licenses.<br\/><br\/>The company in question paid in 1901, 1902 and 1903 the whole of the industrial tax due for the said three years.\u00a0 And it paid the excess on account of the peculiarity introduced in its exaction by reason of the creation of the autonomous provincial and municipal treasuries.\u00a0 An excess which should not enter into this question because the city of Manila had nothing to do with its exaction.<br\/><br\/>What portion of the said taxes paid for the said three years corresponds to the city of Manila from the 7th of August, when it was created is not a matter within the jurisdiction of the company nor of the courts of justice; it is a financial administrative question which should be settled between the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the provincial treasuries that received the partial amounts that make up the total sum of P128,839.95 paid by the company.<br\/><br\/>It appears, therefore, very evident that the P88,698 was a second payment improperly exacted; hence, this claim for the amount improperly paid is fully justified, and the entire amount, that is, the P88,698, with legal interest thereon as ordered in the judgment appealed from, should be refunded.\u00a0 The judgment appealed should be affirmed in all its parts.<br\/><\/div>",

that these latter also died; the first named was the father of the plaintiff; the second was the father of the defendant Eustaquio Salvacion; and the last named was the mother of the other defendant, Andres Salting; that the said lands are now in the possession of the defendants and have not been divided among the heirs, as the plaintiff, notwithstanding the extrajudicial actions taken by him, has been unable to obtain the apportionment of the same, for which reason he prays the court below to enter judgment ordering that the lands in question be divided into equal parts between the plaintiff and the defendants, and that the latter be sentenced to pay the costs and damages.<br\/><br\/>The representative of the defendant Eustaquio Salvacion, in answer to the foregoing complaint, denied the first allegation as being false, and set forth that the said lands had already been apportioned during the lifetime of the children, Lazaro, Evaristo, and Dorotea Salvacion, that each of them had received his share to which the plaintiff and the defendants had particularly succeeded as the respective children of the above-named brothers.\u00a0 As a special defense he alleged that the question of the ownership of the lands possessed by Eustaquio Salvacion had already been ventilated in a civil action before the same court, the same David Salvacion being the plaintiff therein; the suit was decided in favor of the former, who afterwards, out of affection and regard for the said plaintiff, made him a present of one of the parcels of land in question, which David Salvacion received and of which he is now in possession; for said reason he asked that judgment with costs be entered against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>According to a telegraphic communication of the 5th of January, 1906, addressed to the clerk of the court by Silvestre Arzadon, Andres Salvacion was unable to appear before the court for the reason that he was seriously ill, and he conformed to the petition\u00a0 of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The case was tried and evidence was adduced by the parties; the trial judge in view of the evidence adduced and of the documents that were made of record, entered judgment on the 20th of February, 1907, absolving the defendants Eustaquio Salvacion and Andres Salting of the complaint, without any special ruling as to costs.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff excepted to the above decision and moved for a new trial on the ground that the evidence did not justify the decision and that said decision was contrary to law.\u00a0 The motion was overruled, whereupon the petitioner at once gave notice of his intention to appeal by means of the corresponding bill of exceptions.\u00a0 The court below, while overruling the motion, admitted the statement of the plaintiff and directed the clerk of the court to enter the same in the corresponding register, and the bill of exceptions, together with\u00a0 the record of the case, was submitted to this court.\u00a0 By an order of May 25, 1907, the appellant was authorized to appeal to this court as a pauper in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 1123 of the Philippine Commission.<br\/><br\/>It is an established rule of this court, in consonance with the provisions of section 497, paragraph 3, of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended by Act No. 1596, that, where a motion for a new trial is overruled by a lower court, and no exception is taken to the overruling, the Supreme Court has no authority to review the evidence, and, admitting the facts held to be proven, it shall limit its jurisdiction to the questions of law.\u00a0 (Decision in case\u00a0 No. 4,100, among others, Singayan <i>vs<\/i>. Mabborang, 10 Phil. Rep., 601.)<br\/><br\/>It appears from the bill of exceptions submitted by the appellant that he did not except to the order of the court below of the 30th of March, 1907, by which his motion for the reopening of the case and the holding of a new trial was denied; for said reason, in accordance with the law and the established rules, we are not permitted to review the evidence in the present case, and this court of appeal, after admitting the facts established by the court below in its judgment and the conclusions therein contained, will limit its jurisdiction to reviewing and deciding such questions of law as may have arisen between the contending parties.<br\/><br\/>It is held in the judgment appealed\u00a0 from that it has been proven that a partition had already been made of the property belonging to the inheritance of the grandparents of the plaintiff and the defendant, between the parents of the same, and among the said property appears the greater part of the lands now claimed; and that the lands referred to in some of the documents produced by the defendant did not come from the said inheritance and that they were acquired by the latter; therefore, the plaintiff has no right to claim a participation in them.<br\/><br\/>As to the fact alleged that the partition as made was unequal, and that the lands already apportioned were again taken possession of by the defendant, the judgment states that a different action should be brought, and not one for the partition of the property already distributed.<br\/><br\/>We consider that the judgment appealed from is in accordance with the facts and the merits of the case.<br\/><br\/>It should be\u00a0 noted that, under article 406 of the Civil Code, the\u00a0 rules relating to the division of an estate shall be applicable to division among the coowners.<br\/><br\/>The special remedy authorized by sections 181 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure can only be availed of by the person who is a coowner of real estate possessed in common and undivided; without these requisites no action can be brought by a person who is not entitled to real estate owned exclusively by a third party without the characteristics of joint ownership and undivided interest mentioned.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, it is our\u00a0 opinion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, and we do hereby affirm it with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

he likewise denied the facts alleged in paragraph 8 in so far as they do not conform to those that he would allege as a second\u00a0 defense; he offered a general and\u00a0 specific\u00a0 denial to the allegations in paragraph 9 as\u00a0 well as to those contained in paragraph 10 of the complaint.\u00a0 As a Second defense, he alleged that the dispositive part of the judgment\u00a0 rendered in\u00a0 said case No. 2060 and\u00a0 copied in the complaint,\u00a0 finds,\u00a0 among other things that are made an\u00a0 integral part\u00a0 of his\u00a0 answer, the following:\u00a0 The facts therefore conclusively show that the mercantile relations between\u00a0 the deceased\u00a0 Aramburu\u00a0 and Ortiz, by virtue of the public instrument\u00a0 dated July 15, 1889, were reassumed or continued after the death of the former, between the eleven defendant heirs of the deceased and the said Ortiz, under the same conditions and guaranties as were stipulated in said instrument;\u00a0 that the property of the inheritance\u00a0 of the late Aramburu\u00a0 was in the possession of his heir Ceferino Aramburu\u00a0 y Garcia, the other\u00a0 defendant heirs, and Jose Rodriguez de Hinojosa, without one or other or any of them having availed themselves of the benefit of inventory or the right to deliberate within the term granted\u00a0 by law; it\u00a0 is evident that\u00a0 they showed their\u00a0 intention not to\u00a0 make use of the\u00a0 same when they held with Ortiz the conferences\u00a0 and agreements that resulted in said transactions and the continuation thereof in the form and to the extent heretofore\u00a0 described, which acts did not constitute the mere keeping or\u00a0 temporary administration of\u00a0 the inheritance; and\u00a0 that, by means\u00a0 of these acts, the\u00a0 eleven\u00a0 defendants assumed\u00a0 the title and quality of heirs of\u00a0 the\u00a0 late Aramburu\u00a0 y Lambarri, and publicly, and\u00a0 in\u00a0 all their business transactions, made use thereof, particularly in such as they had with Ortiz, which acts necessarily\u00a0 imply willingness to accept the inheritance, and constitute the tacit\u00a0 acceptance defined\u00a0 by\u00a0 article 999 of\u00a0 the Civil\u00a0 Code;\u00a0 an\u00a0 acceptance\u00a0 which\u00a0 is\u00a0\u00a0 pure\u00a0 and simple on the\u00a0 part of the heirs who are of age,\u00a0 and which, according to paragraph 2 of article 992, must be\u00a0 understood as made under\u00a0 benefit of\u00a0 inventory\u00a0 on the\u00a0 part of those who are minors, for the reason that\u00a0 it was carried\u00a0 out by\u00a0 their tutor,\u00a0 Ceferino Aramburu\u00a0 y Garcia,\u00a0 without it appearing\u00a0 that he had secured authority\u00a0 for the purpose from the\u00a0 family council;\u00a0 consequently,\u00a0 the one and\u00a0 the other acceptance, according to its class, should produce the effects respectively defined by articles 1003 and 1023 of said code,\u00a0 for which reason the defendants, as inheriting the\u00a0 assets\u00a0 and\u00a0 liabilities of the deceased,\u00a0 must be\u00a0 considered as\u00a0 continuing to\u00a0 bear the responsibility of the deceased in the business carried on with Ortiz to such extent as may respectively correspond to\u00a0 them, according to the acceptance made by them of the inheritance of their principal;\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 Supreme Court,\u00a0 upon affirming the\u00a0 judgment of the court below, advanced as a ground for its decision, among others, the following: It was admitted that the entire assets of \"the firm\" of The\u00a0 Heirs of C. Aramburu, the name under which the business was carried on after the death: of the latter, was the property which the latter had left to his heirs.\u00a0\u00a0 This property was taken possession of and\u00a0 managed\u00a0 by this new\u00a0 firm.\u00a0 Any of the heirs who participated in these acts accepted the inheritance without\u00a0 benefit of an inventory and\u00a0 became\u00a0 personally responsible for the obligations of the deceased.\u00a0\u00a0 (Arts 999, 1000, Civil\u00a0 Code.)\u00a0\u00a0 That Ceferino Aramburu for himself and as attorney in fact of all the heirs except Leonor, did participate in these acts, is\u00a0 clearly proved.\u00a0\u00a0 As to the appellant\u00a0 Leonor,\u00a0 the wife\u00a0 of Jose Rodriguez de Hinojosa, it appears that the latter administered said business for several years while she was in\u00a0 these\u00a0 Islands,\u00a0 and\u00a0 there is sufficient evidence to hold that she consented to the acts performed\u00a0 by\u00a0 her coheirs\u00a0 and\u00a0 accepted the\u00a0 inheritance without benefit of inventory; that\u00a0 from these conclusions there follows the legal consequence that the\u00a0 plaintiff, Matilde Aramburu, was responsible in solidum with her coheirs for the total indebtedness of her deceased father, claimed in the said\u00a0 civil case No. 2060; that, with\u00a0 the exception of the sum of P8,277.09, cash, withdrawn from the Hongkong Bank,\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant has not received any other sum of money from the property of\u00a0 the plaintiff in payment of the judgment rendered\u00a0 in\u00a0 said\u00a0 case\u00a0 No. 2060,\u00a0 since, although the sheriff\u00a0 of\u00a0 Albay\u00a0 offered at public auction certain rights and interests that the plaintiff had or might have over property administered\u00a0 in the proceedings of the intestate estate of Josefa\u00a0 Garcia,\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff's\u00a0 mother, and\u00a0 in the estate of Ceferino Aramburu y\u00a0 Lambarri, as well\u00a0 as in\u00a0 the estate\u00a0 of Jose M.a Ceballos, instituted in the Court of First Instance\u00a0 of Albay, as no bidder\u00a0 came forward, Angel\u00a0 Ortiz\u00a0 moved that the said rights and interests of the plaintiff be adjudicated to him at given prices so that\u00a0 they\u00a0 might\u00a0 be applied in\u00a0 part\u00a0 payment\u00a0 of said judgment; but the fact is that the said plaintiff, ignoring all rights of the defendant Ortiz\u00a0 over said interests\u00a0 sold, claims to still have\u00a0 and\u00a0 maintain all\u00a0 her\u00a0 interest in the property included in\u00a0 said proceedings, and has denied and still\u00a0 denies\u00a0 Ortiz any\u00a0 interest\u00a0 therein,\u00a0 and\u00a0 claimed and still\u00a0 claims\u00a0 to be and continue to be an interested\u00a0 party in said proceedings;\u00a0 and\u00a0 as third defense he alleges\u00a0 that, even\u00a0 on\u00a0 the supposition that the\u00a0 plaintiff had really paid more than she was bound\u00a0 to pay by reason of the judgment in said\u00a0 case\u00a0 No. 2060, she is\u00a0 not\u00a0 entitled to bring any action against the defendant Ortiz\u00a0 to recover the excess; that if such claim existed it should be brought\u00a0 against her codebtors\u00a0 and coheirs sentenced\u00a0 in\u00a0 said case\u00a0 No. 2060, and, in\u00a0 view\u00a0 of what\u00a0 has been\u00a0 set forth,\u00a0 he prays the court to\u00a0 dismiss the plaintiff's claim\u00a0 with\u00a0 costs against her.<br\/><br\/>At the trial the plaintiff presented as evidence under Exhibit A all the civil orders involved in case No. 2060 of the Court\u00a0 of First Instance of Manila\u00a0 in which\u00a0 are included the complaint and the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 rendered\u00a0 therein.\u00a0 Both parties agreed that the accounting set out in paragraph 9 of the complaint was correct.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendant in turn presented as evidence the original judgment rendered by the lower court\u00a0 and the amended complaint in\u00a0 the said case No.\u00a0 2060,\u00a0 together with the decision of the Supreme Court, for the purpose of proving the fourth allegation of his answer; he also offered as evidence\u00a0 the printed copy of civil case No. 143 in the Court\u00a0 of First Instance of Albay in connection with the estate of the late Jose\u00a0 M.a Ceballos, reviewed by\u00a0 the Supreme Court under No. 4190,[1] wherein Angel Ortiz\u00a0 appears as appellant,\u00a0 and Matilde\u00a0 Aramburu\u00a0 the\u00a0 appellee.\u00a0\u00a0 The judge below ordered that the original judgment rendered in case\u00a0 No.\u00a0 2060 be marked as \"Exhibit 1,\" the amended complaint as \"Exhibit 2,\" the\u00a0 decision\u00a0 of the Supreme Court in said\u00a0 matter as\u00a0 \"Exhibit\u00a0 3,\" and the printed copy of case No. 143 of the Court of Albay as \"Exhibit 4.\"<br\/><br\/>On the 5th of March of this year judgment was entered by the\u00a0 trial court absolving the defendant of the previous complaint with the\u00a0 costs\u00a0 against\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff.\u00a0\u00a0 On\u00a0 the following day counsel for the plaintiff excepted in writing and announced\u00a0 his intention to file and forward\u00a0 a bill of exceptions,\u00a0 and\u00a0 in addition moved\u00a0 that the said judgment be set aside and a new trial granted on the ground that the evidence was insufficient and did not justify the\u00a0 decision of the court below,\u00a0 which decision was furthermore contrary to law; his motion was overruled on the 15th of said month, to which the petitioner excepted and presented in due course the corresponding bill of exceptions which\u00a0 was approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>After the record\u00a0 of the suit\u00a0 brought by Angel\u00a0 Ortiz against Josefa Aramburu et al.\u00a0 under No.\u00a0 2060,\u00a0 for\u00a0 the recovery of a certain sum of money, was returned to\u00a0 the Court of\u00a0 First Instance on April 23,\u00a0 1907,\u00a0 with\u00a0 certified copies of the judgment and the affirmative decision rendered by this\u00a0 court, counsel for one\u00a0 of the defendants, Matilde Aramburu y Garcia, presented a written motion\u00a0 on the 10th\u00a0 of September of the said year, that is to say, four months\u00a0 and a half later, requesting\u00a0 that the said judgment and decision be made clear in the sense that the defendants were\u00a0 sentenced\u00a0 to pay\u00a0 the\u00a0 amount claimed\u00a0 not severally but jointly,\u00a0 that is, that each defendant\u00a0 shall respond for one eleventh part of the debt and the corresponding interest thereon.\u00a0\u00a0 To this end he alleged that the judgment of the lower court,\u00a0 as affirmed by this court, did not impose\u00a0 an obligation in solidum on said defendants, nor had the plaintiff asked that the payment be ordered made in\u00a0 that manner; that the explanation prayed for did not violate article 1003\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Civil\u00a0 Code, and that\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 Matilde Aramburu did not refuse\u00a0 to pay\u00a0 her share\u00a0 with her own property, seeing that the\u00a0 inherited\u00a0 property\u00a0 was not sufficient even\u00a0 though said judgment be made clear, and she only wishes to know the extent of her obligation.<br\/><br\/>The court,\u00a0 after discussing the matter in its\u00a0 sitting of the 23d of the\u00a0 month of September, resolved to overrule the motion.<br\/><br\/>Before taking up the question set up in this controversy and in\u00a0 the appeal interposed against the judgment of the court below, we deem it advisable and pertinent to refer to the aforesaid motion which was duly acted upon and finally decided in said resolution, inasmuch as the point for which an explanation was requested (in\u00a0 the sense that\u00a0 the order of\u00a0 payment of\u00a0 the\u00a0 amount claimed in\u00a0 the\u00a0 complaint, as decreed\u00a0 in the judgment affirmed\u00a0 by\u00a0 this court, shall be considered as mancomun, and not in solidum, so that the petitioner would only be responsible for one eleventh part of the debt with interest thereon), was considered\u00a0 in the complaint filed in this new suit as settled and a determining reason\u00a0 for bringing the suit,\u00a0 notwithstanding\u00a0 the said resolution which conclusively overruled her pretension, as may be seen from folio 56\u00a0 of the record of the\u00a0 principal proceedings, bearing the register number 3143.<br\/><br\/>With the above preface, and proceeding to an examination of the errors assigned in the judgment appealed\u00a0 from, we find in\u00a0 the appellant's brief and\u00a0 bill of errors\u00a0 that the following question\u00a0 has been\u00a0 set\u00a0 up:\u00a0 Has the\u00a0 order\u00a0 of payment of the\u00a0 debt contained in\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 the character of an obligation in solidum, so that Matilde Aramburu, one of the debtors, is under obligation\u00a0 to pay the whole amount of the indebtedness although entitled to claim from her codefendants?\u00a0 The\u00a0 provisions\u00a0 of articles 1084 and 1085 of the Civil Code answer the question in the affirmative.<br\/><br\/>The question at issue is an hereditary debt, acknowledged after the death of\u00a0 the debtor, the common\u00a0 principal, by six of his heirs\u00a0 who are\u00a0 of age\u00a0 and by the representative of the five minors,\u00a0 and as the former accepted the inheritance purely and\u00a0 simply, without\u00a0 the\u00a0 benefit of inventory, since by the acceptance of the inheritance of the late Ceferino Aramburu y\u00a0 Lambarri as\u00a0 made by the said six heirs\u00a0 who are of age, among them\u00a0 being\u00a0 the plaintiff herein, Matilde Aramburu, according to article 1003 of the code they thereupon became liable for all of the charges of said inheritance not only with the\u00a0 inherited property but also with their own; for said reason the condemnatory judgment entered in case\u00a0 No. 2060 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, which bears No.\u00a0 3143 of the general register of this court, was properly executed with\u00a0 regard to the legal portion or interest in the estates of her deceased parents which pertained to Matilde Aramburu, also with regard\u00a0 to her own property, and even such\u00a0 as she was entitled to from the estate of her\u00a0 late husband, Jose Ma. Ceballos.<br\/><br\/>Granted the foregoing, and as the court must abide by the express provisions of the law, it must\u00a0 be affirmed that the obligation to pay the large sum in\u00a0 controversy as decreed in the\u00a0 said judgment is in solidum,\u00a0 although\u00a0 it may not be clearly stated therein.\u00a0\u00a0 The obligation of heirs who accept an inheritance encumbered by debts does not arise from the contracts, but from the law which has established the right\u00a0 to\u00a0 inherit, and has declared\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 obligation to pay an hereditary indebtedness is in solidum, as whatever may have been tfce form\u00a0 in\u00a0 which they accepted the inheritance, and, according to the\u00a0 form of such acceptance, the extent of their respective liability would\u00a0 differ, but the creditor is entitled\u00a0 to\u00a0 claim\u00a0 the entire amount of his credit from any one of the heirs who accepted the inheritance\u00a0 without benefit\u00a0 of\u00a0 inventory, and also from any of the others who received the same with benefit to the extent of their hereditary portion.\u00a0\u00a0 (Arts. 988, 998,\u00a0 1003, 1010, 1023, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>It\u00a0 is immaterial to the creditor of the\u00a0 principal what may\u00a0 be the number of the heirs.\u00a0 He has the right to select one or more of them who may inspire\u00a0 him with confidence or offer him\u00a0 better assurances for the collection of his\u00a0 credit. If the debt is\u00a0 a single\u00a0 one,\u00a0 as\u00a0 in\u00a0 the present case, the obligation of'the debtors toward the owner of the credit is also one and indivisible.\u00a0 The\u00a0 power\u00a0 to divide the debt between the\u00a0 debtor heirs,. as well\u00a0 as the\u00a0 inheritance,\u00a0 resulting from the relations among themselves, can not affect the right of the creditor which already\u00a0 existed before the death of the principal and\u00a0 before the rights of his heirs. There is no law or proper\u00a0 reason to compel a\u00a0 creditor to divide his action into the\u00a0 number of heirs\u00a0 a\u00a0 debtor\u00a0 may have, and\u00a0 incur\u00a0 the\u00a0 risks\u00a0 and expenses\u00a0 arising\u00a0 from a multiplicity of suits.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing is based on various provisions of the Civil Code peculiarly harmonized and interrelated,\u00a0 and particularly on the above-cited articles\u00a0 and articles 1082,\u00a0 1088, and\u00a0 1084, the first and last\u00a0 of which are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 1082. Creditors, recognized as such, may oppose the division of the inheritance until they are paid or the amount of their credits is secured.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 1084. After the division has been made the creditors may demand the payment\u00a0 of their debts in full of any of the heirs who may not have accepted the inheritance under the\u00a0 benefit of\u00a0 inventory, or up to the amount of\u00a0 their hereditary\u00a0 share in case they have accepted it under\u00a0 such benefit.<br\/><br\/>\"In either case the\u00a0 defendant shall have a right to notify and\u00a0 summon his coheirs, unless, by disposition\u00a0 of\u00a0 the testator or by reason of the division, he alone should be bound to pay the debt.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The supreme court of Spain, in applying the\u00a0 provisions of the above two articles of the code in deciding appeals in cassation, established\u00a0 in that\u00a0 of the 9th of January, 1901, the following doctrine:<br\/><blockquote>\"That the provisions contained in articles 1082 and\u00a0 1084 of the\u00a0 Civil Code\u00a0 do\u00a0 not restrict\u00a0 or limit in any way the right of the hereditary creditor to exercise the\u00a0 actions derived from his title of credit, and to demand the payment of the\u00a0 amount thereof\u00a0 even\u00a0 when the\u00a0 inheritance remains undivided; inasmuch\u00a0 as the first of said provisions\u00a0 does nothing more\u00a0 than establish in favor\u00a0 of the\u00a0 creditor a faculty which he may or may not use as he wishes, that is, to oppose the division until he has been paid or the amount of his\u00a0 credit has been secured; and the second,\u00a0 namely article 1084, does not\u00a0 subordinate the exercise of his action to the fact that the inheritance has been\u00a0 divided, but sustains the principle that each heir is jointly liable for the hereditary\u00a0 debts, and\u00a0 authorizes\u00a0 the\u00a0 creditor to demand the whole amount of the debt from any of the simple heirs, and grants the defendant\u00a0 the right to notify and summon his coheirs, unless, by disposition of the testator\u00a0 or by reason of the division,\u00a0 he alone should be bound to pay the debt.\"<\/blockquote>In that of April 3, 1903, is the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"That under the provisions of\u00a0 article 1084\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Civil Code, as\u00a0 construed\u00a0 by recent jurisprudence,\u00a0 each of the heirs is liable in solidum for the hereditary debts.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The provision contained in article 1085\u00a0 of said\u00a0 code sustains all our findings with regard to the character in solidum of the obligation to pay the credit of\u00a0 Angel Ortiz on the part of the heirs\u00a0 of the deceased\u00a0 debtor,\u00a0 Ceferino Aramburu, inasmuch as,\u00a0 if\u00a0 the\u00a0 creditor is\u00a0 entitled\u00a0 to proceed against any one of the heirs in order to recover the value of his credit, the coheir\u00a0 who has paid more than corresponds to his share in the inheritance may\u00a0 in turn\u00a0 demand his proportionate part of the others.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the expression in solidum need not be looked for in a judgment recognizing the validity of an obligation which affects and encumbers\u00a0 an\u00a0 inheritance,\u00a0 but in the substantive law,\u00a0 which, in\u00a0 establishing hereditary\u00a0 right, at the same time proclaimed the joint nature of the obligation on\u00a0 the part of any of his heirs to pay the\u00a0 debts of the deceased, without prejudice to\u00a0 the right conferred upon the coheir under article 1085 to demand\u00a0 his proportional part of\u00a0 the others.<br\/><br\/>The complaint of Ortiz,\u00a0 demanding\u00a0 payment from\u00a0 the heirs\u00a0 of\u00a0 Ceferino\u00a0 Aramburu of the\u00a0 large sum of money that the latter owed him while living, even though it contained no prayer that the\u00a0 heirs be jointly sentenced, was yet sufficient to\u00a0 produce the effect that the judgment rendered in the matter should\u00a0 be considered as involving the character\u00a0 of <i>in\u00a0 solidum,<\/i> it being in accordance with the law that has decreed the joint obligation on the part of the heirs to pay the debts of their deceased principal.\u00a0\u00a0 Nothing in the law\u00a0 provides that the creditor must divide his suit for the recovery of his credit into the number of responsible heirs.<br\/><br\/>If the obligation in question is per se in solidum, it follows that the judgment rendered in consonance therewith should bear the same character, and that on motion of the creditor its execution may be effected against all or any one of the parties finally sentenced therein.\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec. 471, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>On the other hand it\u00a0 should\u00a0 be noted that the question raised herein has already been\u00a0 overruled and finally negatived by the said resolution of this court of September 23, 1907, and that in claiming from Ortiz the restitution of a certain sum which the\u00a0 plaintiff\u00a0 alleges to have paid in excess,\u00a0 she\u00a0 has instituted an improper suit which tends to violate\u00a0 the\u00a0 law that\u00a0 protects the creditor\u00a0 in his relations with\u00a0 the heirs of his deceased debtor, and to discredit or modify a\u00a0 final\u00a0 judgment rendered in\u00a0 accordance with the law, and\u00a0 which\u00a0 must be understood, complied\u00a0 with,\u00a0 and executed in\u00a0 conformity with its precepts.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, and considering that\u00a0 the judgment appealed from is in accordance with the law, it is our opinion that the\u00a0 same should be and it is hereby affirmed, with the costs against the petitioner.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Johnson<\/i> and <i>Elliott, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"left\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>Ortiz<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> vs<\/span>.

At about 1\u00a0 o'clock that night Basco, hearing a noise, awoke his aunt, saying that he\u00a0 believed that\u00a0 there\u00a0 was\u00a0 some stranger in the room. By the light which Basco had lit they saw a man\u00a0 hiding\u00a0 behind a column\u00a0 who,\u00a0 on being held by Benavente's wife,\u00a0 gave her a push and escaped through the same window\u00a0 by which he\u00a0 had entered\u00a0 and which had\u00a0 been\u00a0 left\u00a0 partly open.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 window, like\u00a0 all the others of the room, was in\u00a0 the outer wall of the house, about 8 varas from the ground.\u00a0 The defendant, climbing over the fence which inclosed the lower part of the house, raised himself to the window, which\u00a0 was fastened by a transverse piece of wood.<br\/><blockquote>\"It appears that\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant made\u00a0 use\u00a0 of\u00a0 a weapon to open\u00a0 that window by applying it to\u00a0 the\u00a0 ends of both sections, which were joined, and, as the\u00a0 window bolt was half\u00a0 worn-out, he was\u00a0 able to raise\u00a0 it\u00a0 and thus opened the window, breaking the bolt; that is to say, between the crack in the wall of the\u00a0 house\u00a0 and the edge of the window a mark was seen which\u00a0 was left by some instrument used to raise the window catch (pp.\u00a0 23 and 24 of the record).\"<\/blockquote>The preceding facts were proved.<br\/><br\/>The only argument offered\u00a0 by the\u00a0 defense is that the defendant did not forcibly enter a house\u00a0 in which he was in the habit of sleeping and considered as his own home.<br\/><br\/>But the place through which\u00a0 he entered\u00a0 was not a proper entrance to the house, and he\u00a0 did climb up into\u00a0 the house as any stranger might have done who had\u00a0 conceived the same purpose as did\u00a0 the defendant.\u00a0 Moreover, not because he had been authorized\u00a0 to occasionally pass\u00a0 the night in the dining room, was he also authorized stealthily to enter; not the dining room, but the apartment\u00a0 reserved for the family, the\u00a0 doors\u00a0 and windows of which were\u00a0 all closed that night.<br\/><blockquote>\"The fact that the defendant,\" concludes the trial judge, \"entered in\u00a0 this manner\u00a0 at a late hour of the night, when all the inmates of that house were asleep, clearly establishes the fact that he entered against the will of the occupants.\"<\/blockquote>The crime committed falls squarely within the provisions of article 491, paragraph 2, Penal Code.\u00a0\u00a0 It was perpetrated with violence, this word\u00a0 being\u00a0 understood in the sense already established in the reported cases.\u00a0 (U.

One day in April, 1909, she entered into a formal engagement of marriage with Gelasio Lacuesta, and the betrothed were to marry on Monday, May 24 of the same year. On Sunday, the 23d, the day before the marriage, she was to go to the pueblo in company with her other brother, Venancio Liana, for the purpose of confessing preparatory to her wedding, as she had agreed with her said brother Venancio, on Saturday evening, the 22d. She left her house very early in the morning and went to Venancio's, about 60 meters distant, and invited him to go to the pueblo; but Venancio made the remark that it was still very early and suggested to her that she return to her house and wait until daybreak before starting for the pueblo. Tecla did return toward her house, but she never entered it again. The day dawned, and already a considerable time had elapsed since sunrise when the brothers, Saturnino and Venancio, and their wives started to look for Tecla, who was found, well along in the afternoon, in a small wood near the house, at a distance of some 30 meters therefrom; here, in a hollow, they came upon Tecla's body; it was stretched out on the ground face up; the skull was fractured and the upper teeth were broken; beside it was a piece of a broken club, about 8 inches long, stained with blood.<br\/><br\/>The justice of the peace, accompanied by a police corporal, in default of a competent physician, removed the body and made a description of its condition and immediately held a preliminary investigation, as a result of which a complaint was filed by the provincial fiscal against Juan Idica and Silvestre Yadao for the crime of homicide.<br\/><br\/>The justice of the peace, Buenaventura Arzadon, and the police corporal, Eugenio Baldonado, agree in their testimony that the body of Tecla Liana was found, at half past 5 o'clock of the afternoon of May 23, 1909, hidden in a small wood at a distance of some 30 meters toward the northwest from the house in which the deceased lived; that her brothers and other relatives were present at the time of the discovery; that the body showed that the skull was fractured and bore two other wounds, one in the mouth and the other in the occipital region; that the upper teeth were shattered; that these wounds were apparently inflicted with a club; and that a piece of a club or stick, the part next to the handle and stained with blood, was found at the right side of the body.<br\/><br\/>When the justice of the peace was asked whether he knew to whom the handle of the stick which was shown to him belonged, he replied, \"To Juan Idica, the codefendant of Silvestre Yadao, for he identified it when he testified before me in the justice of the peace court of Badoc\" (p. 11 of the record). And the following cross-question was put to the police corporal by the defense:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Did you people inquire of the family of the deceased as to who might be her slayer or slayers ? - A. Yes, sir, for the justice made an investigation and they told him that they suspected Juan Idica who, they said, was the owner of the club, a piece of which was shown to me.\"<\/blockquote>On the strength of the foregoing and other evidence introduced at the trial, the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte sentenced the defendants, Juan Idica and Silvestre Yadao, to fourteen years eight months and one day of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i>, to the accessory penalties, to pay an indemnity of P1,000 to the heirs of the deceased, and the costs.\u00a0\u00a0 Both defendants appealed from this judgment and the appeal was heard before this court; briefs were submitted by the attorneys for the defense together with a very lucid presentation by the Attorney-General.<br\/><br\/>There is this evidence against Silvestre Yadao: Venancio Liana testified that on his leaving the house of Simon Calaycay on the night of Saturday, May 22, 1909, after 12 o'clock, and passing in front of that of Cesarea Calaycay, he desired to enter her house in order to awaken his <i>compadre,<\/i> Silvestre Yadao, but his sister Tecla Liana, who accompanied him, endeavored to dissuade him by saying that the said Yadao did not have good intentions toward her, and that when, in spite of her persuasion, witness endeavored to awaken him, he saw that Yadao was clasping a stick, of which the piece shown in evidence in the court was a part. Cesarea Calaycay corroborated Venancio Liana's testimony with respect to the cane and identified the piece exhibited at the trial. David Marquez swore that, \"on the morning of May 22, 1909\" (that is, on Saturday, for on Sunday the 23d, Tecla was killed), just at daybreak, he saw the defendants Idica and Yadao running through the garden which lies south of Tecla Liana's house, in the<i> sitio<\/i> between Labot and Puroc, Badoc, Ilocos Norte, and within a distance of about 10 <i>brazas<\/i> from the said house.<br\/><br\/>We next have the testimony of Guillermo Raneses and Luis Idica, the brother-in-law and father, respectively, of the other defendant, Juan Idica. These witnesses testified that Silvestre Yadao confesses to having committed the homicide in question in the following manner; according to Raneses, the latter had met Yadao, who told him that he (Yadao) had just been talking to several persons to induce them to testify for him because he had committed homicide upon the person of Tecla Liana, and witness communicated this statement of Yadao's to his mother-in-law when she came crying to his house on the arrest of her son, Juan Idica, a brother-in-law of the witness; and, according to Luis Idica, on the 28th of May, 1909, while Yadao was passing in front of his (Idica's)\u00a0 house, witness asked him where he was going, to which Yadao replied that he was going to mass and that he would offer two candles in request for divine assistance because he had taken a life as a result of his having made an agreement with the deceased that she should not marry without his consent, and thereupon the witness told him that he should give himself up in order to prevent an innocent person's suffering. This same witness, Juan Idica's father, further testified that, on the 23d of May, 1909, the day of Tecla Liana's death, he noticed the disturbance in Yadao's house, on passing near it, for his parents were crying and Yadao was asking their pardon, saying that he had taken the life of a girl from Badoc; this the witness testified he had heard from the street.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing testimony is all the evidence there is in the case against the defendant Yadao.<br\/><br\/>The criticism of this testimony made by the Attorney-General in this instance is a correct appreciation of the grounds of the charge against the said defendant, and is of the following purport:<br\/><blockquote>\"As to the confessions alleged to have been made by Yadao to Juan Idica's father and brother-in-law to say nothing of the improbability of Yadao thus confessing his guilt to Juan Idica's relatives four or five days after Juan had been arrested, the falsity of this testimony is apparent on its face, and so apparent that we think it not improper here to observe that the responsibility of a prosecutor (<i>procurador<\/i>) who represents the Government extends to the protection of the innocent as well as the punishment of the guilty. A prosecutor should never concede to the pernicious doctrine, which is altogether too prevalent among the ignorant, that 'the end justifies the means.' The fact that a prosecutor believes a defendant to be guilty is never any justification for his permitting witnesses, eager through motives of sentiment or self-interest, to perjure themselves on behalf of the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>\"Eliminating that testimony relative to the alleged confessions of Yadao as wholly unworthy of belief, we next come to the testimony of David Marquez to the effect that he saw Yadao on Sunday morning running away from the scene of the crime in company with Juan Idica. This bald statement is not only contradicted by Yadao himself and his three credible witnesses, but it is in flat contradiction of the credible testimony of the three witnesses for the prosecution, who testified that, in the early morning of that day, Idica was seen alone in the said neighborhood, and two of them swore that they spoke with him.<br\/><br\/>\"So that the whole case against Yadao is reduced to the testimony of Venancio Liana and Cesarea Calaycay that they saw Yadao using Idica's cane 'as a bolster;' but this is specifically denied by Yadao. Therefore, that testimony not only lacks evidentiary force, but is also, we believe, rather a recourse employed in consonance with the reproved doctrine that the end justifies the means. Venancio Liana and Cesarea Calaycay suspected Yadao from the fact that he was in the company of Idica that Saturday night, and so they tried, aided by David Marquez, a brother-in-law of Norberta Campos, and by Idica's relatives, to create a combination against Yadao.<br\/><br\/>\"Against Yadao, not a fact can be discovered in the record to show that this man, who has a wife and five small children and who, according to the testimony of Venancio Liana, did not visit the house of Saturnino Liana oftener than once a year, had any designs whatever upon the deceased, or that he had any real or imaginary cause for injuring her.\"<\/blockquote>The following facts were, without contradiction, proved against Juan Idica:<br\/><br\/>Idica, although he resided in Sinait, 4 kilometers distant from Labot, the place of residence of the Liana family, was very frequently in this latter barrio, as he was a tenant of Mariano Raneses, and on various occasions he visited the house of Saturnino Liana where, as before stated, Tecla Liana lived, and whom he liked, according to the testimony of Saturnino Liana and his wife.<br\/><br\/>Before Tecla Liana's betrothal to Gelasio Lacuesta, one morning just before daylight Juan Idica stealthily entered the house of Saturnino Liana, while all its inmates were asleep and, in going to the place where Tecla was sleeping, trod on the feet of Norberta Campos, Saturnino's wife, who awoke and insulted him, and, on awakening and taking cognizance of the fact that an attempt was being made against her by Idica, Tecla did likewise. From that time, Idica ceased to visit Saturnino's house, although after the incident just mentioned he daily went to the house of Simeon Calaycay, his <i>compadre.<\/i> (Testimony of Norberta Campos.)<br\/><br\/>On the morning of Saturday, May 22, just prior to the death of Tecla Liana, the latter went to the river to do some washing, together with her other sister-in-law, Lorenza Baldivino, the wife of Venancio Liana, and while she was so engaged Idica arrived, bringing his carabao to drink, and opened a conversation. He remarked that Felix Bautista had proposed to him that they both oppose Tecla Liana's marriage, but that he had replied to Bautista, \"and what ground have we to oppose it if we have no dealings with her?\" He continued, saying that if he were Felix Bautista, he would prefer to kill the woman with whom he was in love, if he were rejected by her, rather than oppose her marriage, whereupon the woman Lorenza remarked: \"And what reason nave you to compel the woman, if you have no dealings with her,\" to which Idica replied, \"No matter.\" He was about to leave, when he turned around toward Tecla and spoke with her, making an appointment for that night in the house of Simon Calaycay, where they proposed to meet for the purpose of offering their presents because both of them, Idica and Tecla, had been chosen godfather and godmother, respectively, of a son of Calaycay.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Testimony of Lorenza Baldivino.)<br\/><br\/>On the night of that same day, Saturday, a party was held in the house of Simon Calaycay for the purpose above stated. Tecla Liana went there and also other persons of the barrio; it was already past midnight, and Idica had not yet put in an appearance, wherefore, according to the uniform testimony on this point of those who attended, the party broke up, all returning to their respective homes. Mariano Raneses, one of the guests, on leaving the party, saw Idica in the yard of the house where the gathering was held and asked him why he had not attended, inasmuch as he was godfather and was to act jointly with Tecla, to which he replied that he was ashamed because he had no money. Raneses then asked him from whence he had come and whether he came with Silvestre Yadao (the other defendant), and he answered that he had come from his locality (Sinait) and in the company of Silvestre Yadao and that he had already been there, in the yard of Simon Calaycay's house, a considerable while.<br\/><br\/>Silvestre Yadao testified that, while he was in his house that Saturday night and in conversation with Manuel Palpalatoc, Idica arrived and invited him to go to the house (that where the party gathered) in which the baptism was to be celebrated; that he excused himself, because he felt tired and had a visitor, Palpalatoc, but Idica was so insistent that he finally accompanied him; that while they were on the way witness observed a sparkling ring on one of Idica's fingers and asked him why he carried it, whereupon Idica immediately took off the ring and put it into his pocket, telling Yadao not to touch it as it was the pledge of his love for Tecla Liana; that Idica lamented the fact that Tecla was then about to be married, and expressed to the witness how much he regretted that marriage, but that, notwithstanding, he (Idica) would know how to do what was appropriate; that when they arrived near the house where the baptism was to be held, Idica told the witness to go on ahead, for he (Idica) would first have to go to a certain place; that witness replied that he did not dare to go to the said house, for the reason that he was not invited, and that Idica then suggested to him that he go to the house of Cesarea Calaycay, where witness waited for Idica up to a very late hour, until 12 o'clock midnight, and then returned home, where he still found Palpalatoc.<br\/><br\/>Tecla Liana, at that hour, left the house of Simon Calaycay, and, as before related, her brother Venancio accompanied her to the house of her other brother, Saturnino, where she lived, previously agreeing that on the following day, Sunday, the 23d, they should go to the pueblo in order that Tecla might make her confession preparatory to her marriage, which was to take place on Monday, the 24th.<br\/><br\/>Pursuant to the said arrangement, and before dawn on the following day, Tecla left her house and went to her brother Venancio's, but the latter told her that it was yet too early, it being still dark, and that she should return to her house and sleep a little longer; and Tecla returned toward her home.<br\/><br\/>At dawn of that day Idica passed near the house of Saturnino Liana, and the latter and his wife invited him to come in, but he did not wish to, and proceeded upon his way.<br\/><br\/>When it was broad daylight Venancio went to Saturnino's house for the purpose of going to the pueblo, and it was a surprise for all that Tecla had not returned to the house, as Venancio had told her to do when it was still very early and that she could sleep awhile longer. They set out to look for her and, well along in the afternoon, they found her body in the place and in the manner before related. It was the same place through which Idica had passed at daybreak when Saturnino and his wife had greeted and invited him to come into the house, a place which was one not usually traversed and was a wood adjoining the house of Saturnino Liana.<br\/><br\/>The man who, scarcely had he learned that Tecla Liana was to be married to Lacuesta, tried to surprise her during her sleep at night and entered her house as a robber enters homes to steal others' belongings; who, two days prior to the date set for the marriage, figuratively described his displeasure at Tecla's becoming the wife of another and gave hypothetical expression to his sentiments, by suggesting the death of the woman he desired as a means of preventing her marriage; who learned from the lips of the woman herself that they were to meet at a given place, and that night caused himself to be awaited by the people there, though he went to the place, but remained in the yard of the house a considerable while without entering, while at the same time he had a social duty to perform at that gathering; who probably hoped to be able to speak with Tecla when she should be alone on leaving the house, but likely was again disappointed on seeing that Tecla was returning to her house accompanied by her brother Venancio, thus losing the opportunity to offer her a ring, an expression, as he said, of his vehement amorous desire; that man, who forgot Yadao and was lost from sight, would find a propitious occasion, on seeing Tecla return the following day by an obscure and almost deserted trail which separates Venancio's house from Saturnino's, and very likely it was there that he expected to speak to her and give full rein to his desire before she could enter her house; and it is already known that, if he did not succeed in that purpose, if he were rejected, he (Juan Idica) had resolved \"to do what was appropriate,\" and he had stated \"what was appropriate\" the day before, on the river bank where Tecla was washing clothes, which was to kill Tecla Liana. When he was seen at daybreak of that day to pass near Saturnino's house, through the place which was not an ordinary one of travel, but a wood, and in a hollow or depression in that wood the body of the deceased was found, he had but a short while before carried out his perverse idea of killing the woman who resisted his ungovernable passion.<br\/><br\/>It is to be added that the deceased was killed by blows from a stick, and beside the corpse was found a piece of stick, the part next to the handle, with Idica's initials on it, which numerous witnesses had frequently seen in Idica's hands and which Idica, as the justice of the peace averred, identified as his own at the preliminary investigation.<br\/><br\/>There is no room for reasonable doubt, according to the natural and ordinary course of events, that any man who harbors the wicked idea that when he is disappointed in securing the possession of the woman he desires, and who is to cast her lot with that of another man, he must kill her, thus employing the most expeditious means to prevent her marriage with her successful suitor, when he finds an opportunity to effect such a wicked purpose and the moment and the occasion are critical and propitious for the realization of the design he has planned, he will carry out that idea, thus gratifying his longing either to possess her or to kill her.<br\/><br\/>By reason of the foregoing, the sentence appealed from is affirmed, in so far as it relates to Juan Idica, with one-half of the costs of both instances and the accessory penalties; and the judgment is reversed with respect to Silvestre Yadao, whom we freely absolve, with the other half of the costs <i>de oficio.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><\/div>",

that\u00a0 he carried\u00a0 with\u00a0 him his written appeal and\u00a0 showed it\u00a0 to\u00a0 the justice, who\u00a0 did\u00a0 not\u00a0 receive it,\u00a0 telling\u00a0 him\u00a0 to return on Monday;\u00a0 and that he took no sureties with him, but that\u00a0 he did carry money, although he made no\u00a0 intimation of his wish to deliver\u00a0 the money to him, in view\u00a0 of the fact that the latter told him to return on Monday.\u00a0 On the other hand, the justice\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 peace testified\u00a0 in his behalf that the plaintiff did not present to him, nor did he carry on\u00a0 that occasion any document whatever; that neither did he\u00a0 present\u00a0 to him any\u00a0 bond, and that he\u00a0 merely said to him that he wished to appeal, wherefore the justice told him to return\u00a0 on Monday.\u00a0 On this\u00a0 witness being asked why he did not admit the appeal as\u00a0 it was\u00a0 the fifteenth day, he answered literally as follows: \"<i>It was because he brought nothing with him on that occasion.\" <\/i><br\/><br\/>Section\u00a0 16\u00a0 of Act No.\u00a0 1627,\u00a0 amendatory of section\u00a0 76 of Act No. 190,\u00a0 provides as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>An\u00a0 appeal<\/i> in civil causes\u00a0 shall be perfected by filing with the justice\u00a0 of the peace, within fifteen\u00a0 days after the entry\u00a0 of the\u00a0 judgment complained of, a notice that the party intends to appeal, and by depositing with such justice the appellate\u00a0 court docket fee\u00a0 of sixteen\u00a0 pesos, and by filing with him a bond in\u00a0 the sum of fifty pesos, executed to the adverse party by the appellant and by at\u00a0 least one sufficient\u00a0 surety, conditioned that the appellant\u00a0 will pay all costs\u00a0 which\u00a0 the Court of First Instance may award against him.\u00a0 In lieu of such a\u00a0 bond, the\u00a0 appellant may file with the justice a certificate of the proper\u00a0 official that the appellant has deposited twenty-five pesos with\u00a0 the municipal\u00a0 treasurer (in Manila with\u00a0 the Collector of Internal\u00a0 Revenue)\u00a0 and\u00a0 that said\u00a0 sum\u00a0 is\u00a0 available for the satisfaction of any judgment for costs that may be rendered against appellant by the appellate court in said cause.\"<\/blockquote>Even admitting as true the whole testimony of the plaintiff, the conclusion is\u00a0 that all\u00a0 he did\u00a0 on\u00a0 that occasion amounted\u00a0 to no\u00a0 more\u00a0 than a\u00a0 mere intention to appeal, which was not carried\u00a0 out, or at least was not effected in the manner required by law.\u00a0 Neither did he\u00a0 deposit the P16 for the court fee, nor execute the bond required by law, nor even\u00a0 make any offer of the one or\u00a0 the other, nor did he make the slightest\u00a0 intimation\u00a0 that he was willing at\u00a0 that moment to comply with the\u00a0 said\u00a0 requirements, which was the least that\u00a0 he could have\u00a0 done in\u00a0 order to file his appeal in due form.\u00a0 Far\u00a0 from doing this, he himself asserted that he took no\u00a0 sureties with\u00a0 him and did not tell the justice of\u00a0 the peace that he carried money. And he also testified that what he said to the latter was only that he\u00a0 would file an appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 But\u00a0 the appeal was not filed.\u00a0\u00a0 He did not comply with, nor\u00a0 did he do\u00a0 anything to comply with any of the essential\u00a0 formalities prescribed by law for the perfecting of an\u00a0 appeal.\u00a0 As the justice of the peace states, when he\u00a0 saw that the plaintiff brought nothing,\u00a0 that is, neither money for a deposit nor a bond, he told him to return on Monday.\u00a0 Consequently, the fact of\u00a0 saying that he was\u00a0 to return\u00a0 on another day was not the reason why the appeal\u00a0 was\u00a0 not filed within the term\u00a0 specified by law; it was said because the plaintiff did not then formally file\u00a0 the appeal.\u00a0 We find, therefore, that it has not been\u00a0 shown\u00a0 that the\u00a0 latter was prevented through error or\u00a0 other\u00a0 cause not\u00a0 imputable to himself from filing the appeal in due time.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is reversed\u00a0 and the petition contained in the complaint is denied, without special finding as to costs of\u00a0 this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

In\u00a0 the room there was\u00a0 but\u00a0 one small window, which, like the door, opened on the porch.\u00a0 Aside from the door and window, there\u00a0 were no\u00a0 other openings of any kind in the room.<br\/><br\/>On the night of August 14, 1908, at about 10 o'clock, the defendant, who had\u00a0 retired for the\u00a0 night, was\u00a0 suddenly awakened by someone trying to force open the door of the room.\u00a0 He sat up\u00a0 in bed and\u00a0 called out twice,\u00a0 \"Who\u00a0 is there?\"\u00a0\u00a0 He heard no answer and was convinced by the noise at the door that it was being\u00a0 pushed open by someone bent upon forcing his way into the room.\u00a0 Due to the heavy growth of vines along the\u00a0 front of\u00a0 the porch, the room was very\u00a0 dark, and the defendant, fearing that the\u00a0 intruder was a robber or a thief, leaped to his feet and called out. \"If you enter the room, I\u00a0 will kill\u00a0 you.\"\u00a0\u00a0 At that moment he was struck just above the knee\u00a0 by the edge of the chair which had been placed against the door.\u00a0\u00a0 In the darkness and confusion the defendant thought that the blow had been inflicted\u00a0 by the person who had\u00a0 forced\u00a0 the\u00a0 door open, whom he supposed to be a burglar, though in the light of after events, it is probable that\u00a0 the chair\u00a0 was merely thrown\u00a0 back into the room\u00a0 by the sudden opening of the door against which it rested. Seizing a common kitchen knife which he\u00a0 kept under his pillow, the defendant struck out wildly at the intruder who, it\u00a0 afterwards turned\u00a0 out, was his\u00a0 roommate,\u00a0 Pascual.\u00a0 Pascual ran\" out upon the porch and fell down on the steps in a desperately wounded condition, followed by the defendant, who\u00a0 immediately recognized him in the moonlight.\u00a0 Seeing that Pascual was wounded, he called to his employers who slept in the next house, No. 28, and ran back to his room to\u00a0 secure bandages to bind up Pascual's wounds.<br\/><br\/>There\u00a0 had been several\u00a0 robberies in Fort McKinley not long prior to the date of the\u00a0 incident just described, one of which took place in\u00a0 a house in which the defendant was employed as cook; and as defendant alleges, it was because of these repeated robberies he kept a knife under his pillow for his personal protection.<br\/><br\/>The deceased and the accused, who roomed together and who\u00a0 appear to have\u00a0 been on friendly and amicable terms prior to the fatal incident, had an understanding that when either\u00a0 returned at night, he should knock at\u00a0 the door and acquaint his companion with his identity.\u00a0\u00a0 Pascual\u00a0 had left the house early\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 evening and gone for a walk with his friends, Celestino Quiambao and Mariano Ibanez, servants employed at officers' quarters No. 28, the nearest house\u00a0 to the mess hall. The three returned from their walk at about 10 o'clock, and Celestino and Mariano stopped at their room at No. 28, Pascual going on to his room at No. 27.\u00a0 A few\u00a0 moments after the party separated, Celestino\u00a0 and Mariano heard cries for assistance\u00a0 and upon returning to\u00a0 No. 27 found Pascual sitting on the back steps fatally wounded in\u00a0 the stomach, whereupon\u00a0 one of them ran back to No. 28 and called Lieutenants Jacobs and Healy, who\u00a0 immediately went to the aid of the wounded man.<br\/><br\/>The defendant then\u00a0 and there admitted\u00a0 that he had stabbed his roommate,\u00a0 but\u00a0 said that he did\u00a0 it\u00a0 under the impression that\u00a0 Pascual was \"a\u00a0 ladron\" because he forced open the door of their\u00a0 sleeping room, despite defendant's warnings.<br\/><br\/>No reasonable explanation of the remarkable conduct on the part of Pascual\u00a0 suggests itself,\u00a0 unless it be that the boy\u00a0 in a\u00a0 spirit of\u00a0 mischief was playing a\u00a0 trick on his Chinese roommate, and sought to frighten him by forcing his way into the room, refusing to give his\u00a0 name\u00a0 or say who\u00a0 he was, in\u00a0 order to make Ah Chong believe that he was being attacked by a robber.<br\/><br\/>Defendant was placed under arrest forthwith, and Pascual was\u00a0 conveyed to the\u00a0 military hospital, where he died from the effects\u00a0 of the wound on the following\u00a0 day.<br\/><br\/>The defendant was charged with the crime of assassination,\u00a0 tried, and\u00a0 found guilty by the trial court of simple homicide, with extenuating circumstances, and sentenced to six years and one day p<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">residio mayor, <\/span>the minimum penalty prescribed by law.<br\/><br\/>At the trial in\u00a0 the\u00a0 court below the defendant\u00a0 admitted that he killed his roommate, Pascual Gualberto, but insisted that he\u00a0 struck the fatal blow without\u00a0 any intent to do a wrongful act, in the exercise of his lawful right of self-defense.<br\/><br\/>Article 8 of the\u00a0 Penal Code\u00a0 provides that - <br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 following are not\u00a0 delinquent\u00a0 and\u00a0 are\u00a0 therefore exempt from criminal liability:<br\/><br\/>\"4. He who acts in defense of his person or rights, provided there are the following attendant circumstances:<br\/><br\/>\"(1)\u00a0 Illegal aggression.<br\/><br\/>\"(2)\u00a0 Reasonable\u00a0 necessity\u00a0 of the means\u00a0 employed\u00a0 to prevent or repel it.<br\/><br\/>\"(3)\u00a0 Lack of sufficient provocation on\u00a0 the\u00a0 part of the person defending himself.\"<\/blockquote>Under these provisions we think that there can be no doubt that defendant would be entitled to complete exemption from criminal liability\u00a0 for the death of the victim of his fatal blow, if the intruder who forced open the door of his room had been in\u00a0 fact a dangerous\u00a0 thief or \"ladron,\" as the defendant believed him to be.\u00a0\u00a0 No one, under such circumstances,\u00a0 would doubt the right of the defendant to resist and repel such\u00a0 an intrusion, and the thief having forced open the door notwithstanding\u00a0 defendant's thrice-repeated warning to desist, and his threat that he would kill the intruder\u00a0 if he persisted in his attempt, it will not be questioned that\u00a0 in the darkness of\u00a0 the\u00a0 night, in a small room, with no means of escape, with the thief advancing upon him despite his warnings, defendant would have been wholly justified\u00a0 in using any\u00a0 available weapon to defend himself from such an assault, and\u00a0 in\u00a0 striking promptly, without waiting for the thief\u00a0 to discover his whereabouts and deliver the first blow.<br\/><br\/>But the evidence clearly discloses that the intruder was not a thief or a \"ladron.\"\u00a0 That neither the defendant nor his property nor any of the property under his charge was in real danger at the\u00a0 time when he struck the fatal blow. That there was\u00a0 no such \"unlawful aggression\" on the part of a thief or \"ladron\" as defendant believed he was repelling and resisting, and that there was no real \"necessity\" for the use of the knife to defend\u00a0 his person or his property or the property\u00a0 under\u00a0 his charge.<br\/><br\/>The question\u00a0 then squarely presents\u00a0 itself, whether in this jurisdiction one can be held criminally responsible who, by\u00a0 reason of a mistake as to the facts, does an\u00a0 act for which\u00a0 he would be exempt from criminal liability if the facts were as he supposed them to\u00a0 be, but which would constitute the crime of\u00a0 homicide or assassination if the actor had known the true state of the facts at the time when he committed the act. To this question we think there can be but one answer,\u00a0 and we hold that under such circumstances there is no\u00a0 criminal\u00a0 liability,\u00a0 provided\u00a0 always that the alleged ignorance or mistake of fact was not due to negligence or bad faith.<br\/><br\/>In broader terms, ignorance or mistake of fact,\u00a0 if such ignorance or mistake of fact is sufficient to negative a particular intent which under the law is a necessary ingredient of the offense charged (e. g., in larceny, <i>animus furendi<\/i>; in murder, malice; in\u00a0 crimes and misdemeanors generally some degree\u00a0 of\u00a0 criminal intent)\u00a0 \"cancels the\u00a0 presumption of intent,\" and\u00a0 works\u00a0 an acquittal; except in those cases where\u00a0 the circumstances\u00a0 demand a\u00a0 conviction\u00a0 under the penal provisions touching criminal negligence; and in cases where, under the provisions of article 1 of the Penal Code one voluntarily committing a crime or misdemeanor incurs criminal liability for any\u00a0 wrongful act committed by him, even though\u00a0 it be different from that which he intended to commit.\u00a0\u00a0 (Wharton's Criminal Law,\u00a0 sec. 87 and\u00a0 cases cited; McClain's Crim.\u00a0 Law, sec. 133 and cases cited; Pettit <i>vs.<\/i> S.,\u00a0 28 Tex. Ap., 240; Commonwealth vs. Power, 7 Met., 596; Yates <i>vs.<\/i> People, 32 N. Y., 509; Isham <i>vs<\/i>. State, 38 Ala., 213; Commonwealth <i>vs.<\/i> Rogers, 7 Met., 500.)<br\/><br\/>The general proposition thus stated hardly admits of discussion,\u00a0 and the only question worthy of consideration is whether malice or criminal intent is an essential element or ingredient of the crimes of\u00a0 homicide and assassination as defined and\u00a0 penalized in the\u00a0 Penal\u00a0 Code.\u00a0\u00a0 It has been said that since the\u00a0 definitions there given of these as well as most\u00a0 other\u00a0 crimes\u00a0 and\u00a0 offenses\u00a0 therein defined, do\u00a0 not specifically and expressly declare that the acts constituting the crime or offense must\u00a0 be committed with malice or with criminal intent in order that\u00a0 the actor may be held criminally liable, the commission of the acts set out in the various definitions subjects the actor\u00a0 to the penalties described therein, unless it appears that he\u00a0 is exempted from liability\u00a0 under one or other of the express provisions of article 8 of the code, which treats of exemptions.\u00a0 But while it is true that contrary\u00a0 to the\u00a0 general rule of legislative enactment in the United\u00a0 States, the definitions of crimes and offenses as set\u00a0 out in the Penal\u00a0 Code rarely contain provisions expressly declaring that malice or\u00a0 criminal intent is an essential\u00a0 ingredient of the crime, nevertheless, the general\u00a0 provisions of article 1 of the code clearly indicate\u00a0 that malice, or criminal intent in\u00a0 some form, is an essential requisite of all crimes and offenses therein defined, in the\u00a0 absence of express provisions modifying the general rule, such as are those\u00a0 touching liability resulting from acts negligently or imprudently committed, and acts done by one voluntarily committing a crime\u00a0 or\u00a0 misdemeanor, where\u00a0 the act committed\u00a0 is\u00a0 different\u00a0 from that\u00a0 which he intended to\u00a0 commit.\u00a0 And it is to be\u00a0 observed that even these exceptions are more\u00a0 apparent than real, for \"There is little distinction, except\u00a0 in degree, between\u00a0 a will to do a wrongful thing and indifference whether it is done or not. Therefore carelessness is criminal, and within limits supplies the place of the affirmative criminal\u00a0 intent\"\u00a0 (Bishop's New Criminal Law,\u00a0 vol.\u00a0 1, s. 313)\u00a0 ; and,\u00a0 again, \"There is so little difference between a disposition to do a great harm and a disposition to do harm that one of them may very well be looked upon as the measure of the other.\u00a0 Since, therefore, the guilt of a\u00a0 crime\u00a0 consists in the disposition to do harm, which the criminal shows by committing it, and since this disposition is greater or less in\u00a0 proportion to the harm which is done by the crime, the consequence is\u00a0 that the guilt of the\u00a0 crime follows the same\u00a0 proportion; it\u00a0 is greater or less according as the crime in its own nature does greater or less harm\"\u00a0 (Ruth. Ints. C. 18, p.\u00a0 11); or, as\u00a0 it has been otherwise stated, the thing\u00a0 done, having proceeded from a corrupt mind, is to be\u00a0 viewed the same whether the corruption\u00a0 was of one particular form or another.<br\/><br\/>Article 1\u00a0 of the Penal Code is\u00a0 as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Crimes or misdemeanors are voluntary acts and omissions punished by law.<br\/><br\/>\"Acts and omissions punished by law are always\u00a0 presumed to be voluntary unless the contrary shall appear.<br\/><br\/>\"Any person\u00a0 voluntarily committing a crime\u00a0 or misdemeanor shall incur criminal\u00a0 liability,\u00a0 even\u00a0 though the wrongful act committed be different from that which he had intended to commit.\"<\/blockquote>The celebrated Spanish jurist Pacheco, discussing the meaning of the word \"voluntary\" as used in this article, says that a voluntary act is a <i>free, intelligent, and intentional act,<\/i> and roundly asserts that\u00a0 without intention\u00a0 (intention to do wrong or criminal\u00a0 intention) there can be no crime; and that the word\u00a0 \"voluntary\" implies and\u00a0 includes the words<i> \"con malicia,\" <\/i> which were expressly set out in the definition of the word \"crime\" in the code of 1822, but omitted from the code of 1870, because, as Pacheco insists, their\u00a0 use in the former code was redundant, being implied and included in the word \"voluntary.\"\u00a0 (Pacheco, Codigo Penal, vol. 1, p. 74.)<br\/><br\/>Viada, while insisting that the absence of intention to commit the crime can only be said to exempt from criminal responsibility when the act which was\u00a0 actually intended to be done was in itself a lawful one, and in the absence of negligence or imprudence,\u00a0 nevertheless admits and recognizes in his\u00a0 discussion of\u00a0 the\u00a0 provisions of this article of the code that in general without intention there\u00a0 can be no crime.\u00a0\u00a0 (Viada,\u00a0 vol. 1,\u00a0 p.\u00a0 16.)\u00a0 And, as we\u00a0 have shown above, the exceptions insisted upon by Viada are more apparent than\u00a0 real.<br\/><br\/>Silvela, in\u00a0 discussing the doctrine herein laid down, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"In fact,\u00a0 it is\u00a0 sufficient to\u00a0 remember the\u00a0 first article, which declares that where there is\u00a0 no intention there is no crime\u00a0 * *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 in\u00a0 order to\u00a0 affirm, without\u00a0 fear of mistake, that under our code there\u00a0 can be no crime if there is no act, an\u00a0 act which must fall within the sphere of ethics if there is no moral injury.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Vol. 2, The Criminal Law, folio 169.)<br\/><\/blockquote>And to the same effect\u00a0 are various decisions of the supreme court\u00a0 of Spain, as, for example in its sentence of May 31, 1882, in which it made\u00a0 use of the following\u00a0 language:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is necessary that\u00a0 this act, in\u00a0 order\u00a0 to\u00a0 constitute a crime, involve all the\u00a0 malice which is supposed\u00a0 from the operation of the\u00a0 will\u00a0 and\u00a0 an\u00a0 intent\u00a0 to\u00a0 cause the\u00a0 injury which may be the object of the crime.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>And again in\u00a0 its sentence of March 16, 1892, wherein it held that\u00a0 \"considering that,\u00a0 whatever may be the\u00a0 civil effects of the inscription of his three sons, made by the appellant\u00a0 in the civil registry and in\u00a0 the parochial church, there can be\u00a0 no crime because of the\u00a0 lack of the\u00a0 necessary element or criminal intention, which characterizes every action\u00a0 or\u00a0 omission punished by\u00a0 law; nor is he\u00a0 guilty of criminal negligence.\"<br\/><br\/>And to\u00a0 the same effect in its sentence of December 30, 1896,\u00a0 it made use of the following language:<br\/><blockquote>\" *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 Considering\u00a0 that the moral element of the crime, that is, intent or malice or their absence\u00a0 in the commission of an act denned and punished by law as criminal, is\u00a0 not a necessary question of fact submitted to the exclusive judgment and decision of the trial court.\" <br\/><\/blockquote>That the author of\u00a0 the Penal Code deemed criminal intent or malice to be\u00a0 an\u00a0 essential\u00a0 element of the various crimes and misdemeanors therein defined becomes clear also from an examination of the provisions of article 568, which are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"He who shall execute through reckless negligence an act that, if done with malice, would constitute a grave crime, shall be punished with the penalty of <i>arresto mayor <\/i>in its maximum\u00a0 degree, to <i>prision correccional<\/i>\u00a0 in its minimum degree, and with <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its minimum and medium degrees if it shall constitute a less grave crime.<br\/><br\/>\"He who in violation of the regulations shall commit a crime through simple imprudence or negligence\u00a0 shall incur the penalty of<i> arresto\u00a0 mayor<\/i> in its medium and maximum degrees.<br\/><br\/>\"In the application of these penalties the\u00a0 courts shall\u00a0 proceed according to their discretion, without\u00a0 being subject to the rules prescribed in article 81.<br\/><br\/>\"The provisions of this article shall not be applicable if the penalty prescribed\u00a0 for the crime is equal to or less than those contained\u00a0 in the first\u00a0 paragraph thereof, in which case the courts shall apply the next one thereto in the degree which they may consider proper.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The\u00a0 word \"malice\" in this article is\u00a0 manifestly\u00a0 substantially equivalent to the words \"criminal intent,\"\u00a0 and the direct inference from its provisions is that the commission of the acts\u00a0 contemplated therein, in the\u00a0 absence of malice (criminal intent), negligence, and imprudence, does not impose any criminal liability on the actor.<br\/><br\/>The word \"voluntary\" as used in article 1 of the Penal Code would seem to\u00a0 approximate in meaning the word \"willful\" as used\u00a0 in English and American statutes to\u00a0 designate\u00a0 a form of\u00a0 criminal intent.\u00a0 It has been said\u00a0 that while the word \"willful\" sometimes means\u00a0 little more than intentionally or designedly, yet\u00a0 it is more frequently understood to extend a little further and approximate the\u00a0 idea of the milder kind of\u00a0 legal malice; that is, it signifies an evil intent without justifiable\u00a0 excuse.\u00a0 In\u00a0 one case it\u00a0 was said to mean,, as employed\u00a0 in a statute\u00a0 in contemplation, \"wantonly\" or \"causelessly;\" in another, \"without reasonable grounds to\u00a0 believe the\u00a0 thing lawful.\"\u00a0\u00a0 And\u00a0 Shaw, C. J., once said that ordinarily\u00a0 in a\u00a0 statute\u00a0 it means \"not merely 'voluntarily' but with a bad purpose; in other words, corruptly.\"\u00a0 In English and\u00a0 the American statutes defining crimes \"malice,\"\u00a0 \"malicious,\"\u00a0 \"maliciously,\" and \"malice aforethought\" are words indicating\u00a0 intent, more\u00a0 purely technical than \"willful\" or \"willfully,\" but \"the difference between them is not great;\" the word \"malice\" not often being\u00a0 understood to require\u00a0 general malevolence toward a particular individual, and signifying rather the intent from which flows any unlawful and injurious act committed without legal justification.\u00a0\u00a0 (Bishop's New Criminal Law,\u00a0 vol. 1, sees. 428 and 429, and cases cited.)<br\/><br\/>But even in the absence of\u00a0 express words in\u00a0 a statute, setting out a\u00a0 condition in the definition of\u00a0 a crime that it be committed \"voluntarily,\" \"willfully,\" \"maliciously,\" \"with malice aforethought,\"\u00a0 or in one of the various modes generally\u00a0 construed to imply a criminal intent, we think that reasoning\u00a0 from general\u00a0 principles it will always be found that,\u00a0 with the rare exceptions hereinafter\u00a0 mentioned, to constitute\u00a0 a crime evil intent\u00a0 must combine with an act. Mr. Bishop, who supports his position\u00a0 with numerous citations from the decided cases, thus forcefully presents this doctrine:<br\/><blockquote>\"In no one thing does criminal jurisprudence differ more from civil than in the rule as to the intent.\u00a0\u00a0 In controversies between private parties the<i> quo animo <\/i>with which a thing was\u00a0 done\u00a0 is sometimes important, not always; but crime proceeds only from a criminal mind.\u00a0 So that - <br\/><br\/>\"There can\u00a0 be\u00a0 no crime, large or small, without an evil mind.\u00a0 In\u00a0 other words,\u00a0 punishment\u00a0 is\u00a0 the\u00a0 sequence\u00a0 of wickedness, without which it can not be.\u00a0\u00a0 And neither in philosophical speculation nor in religious or moral sentiment would any\u00a0 people\u00a0 in any age allow that a man should be deemed guilty unless his mind was so.\u00a0 It is therefore a principle of our legal\u00a0 system,\u00a0 as probably it is\u00a0 of\u00a0 every other, that the essence of an offense is the wrongful intent, without which it can not exist.\u00a0\u00a0 We find this\u00a0 doctrine confirmed by - <br\/><br\/><i>\"Legal maxims.<\/i> - The ancient wisdom of the law, equally with the modern, is distinct on this subject.\u00a0 It consequently has supplied to us such maxims as <i>Actus non facit\u00a0 reum<\/i> nisi mens sit rea, 'the act itself does not make\u00a0 a man guilty unless his intention were so;<i>' Actus me invito factus non est meus actus, <\/i>'an\u00a0 act done by me against my will is not my act;' and others of the like sort.\u00a0 In this, as just said, criminal jurisprudence differs from civil.\u00a0 So\u00a0 also - <br\/><br\/><i> \"Moral science and moral sentiment <\/i>teach the same thing. 'By reference to the intention,\u00a0 we inculpate\u00a0 or exculpate others or ourselves\u00a0 without\u00a0 any respect to the happiness or misery actually produced. Let the\u00a0 result\u00a0 of an action be what it may, we hold a man guilty simply on the ground of intention; or, on the same ground, we hold him innocent.' The calm judgment\u00a0 of mankind keeps this doctrine among its jewels.\u00a0 In times of excitement, when\u00a0 vengeance takes the place of justice, every guard around\u00a0 the innocent is cast down.\u00a0 But with the return of reason comes the public voice that where the mind is pure,\u00a0 he who differs in act from his neighbors does not offend.\u00a0 And - <br\/><br\/>\"In\u00a0 the\u00a0 spontaneous judgment which springs from the nature given\u00a0 by God to\u00a0 man,\u00a0 no one deems another to deserve punishment for what he did from an upright mind, destitute of every form of evil.\u00a0 And whenever a person is made to suffer a punishment which the community deems hot his due, so far from its placing an evil mark upon him, it elevates him to the seat of the martyr.\u00a0 Even\u00a0 infancy itself spontaneously pleads the want of bad\u00a0 intent in justification\u00a0 of what\u00a0 has the appearance\u00a0 of wrong, with\u00a0 the utmost confidence that the plea, if its truth is credited, will be accepted as good.\u00a0 Now these facts\u00a0 are only the voice of nature\u00a0 uttering one of her\u00a0 immutable truths. It is, then, the doctrine of the law, superior to all other doctrines, because first in nature from which the law itself proceeds, that no man is to be punished as a criminal unless his intent is wrong.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Bishop's New Criminal Law, vol. 1, sees. 286 to 290.)<\/blockquote>Compelled by necessity, \"the great master of all things,\" an apparent departure from this doctrine of abstract justice results from the adoption of the arbitrary rule that <i>Ignorantia juris non excusat<\/i>\u00a0 (\"Ignorance of the law excuses no man\"), without which justice could\u00a0 not be administered in our tribunals; and compelled also by the same doctrine of necessity, the courts have\u00a0 recognized the\u00a0 power\u00a0 of the legislature to forbid, in a limited class of cases, the doing of certain acts, and to make their commission criminal without regard to the\u00a0 intent of the doer.\u00a0\u00a0 Without discussing these exceptional cases at length, it is\u00a0 sufficient here to say that the\u00a0 courts have\u00a0 always held that unless the intention of the lawmaker to\u00a0 make the\u00a0 commission of certain acts criminal\u00a0 without regard to the intent of the doer\u00a0 is clear and\u00a0 beyond question the\u00a0 statute will\u00a0 not be so\u00a0 construed (cases cited in Cyc, vol. 12, p. 158,\u00a0 notes 76 and 77) ; and the rule that ignorance of the law excuses no man has been said not to be a real\u00a0 departure\u00a0 from the law's fundamental principle that crime exists only where\u00a0 the mind\u00a0 is at fault, because \"the evil purpose need not be to break the law, and it suffices if\u00a0 it is simply to do\u00a0 the thing\u00a0 which\u00a0 the law\u00a0 in fact forbids.\"\u00a0 (Bishop's New\u00a0 Criminal Law, sec. 300, and cases cited.)<br\/><br\/>But, however this may be, there is no technical rule, and no pressing\u00a0 necessity therefor, requiring mistake\u00a0 in fact to be dealt with otherwise\u00a0 than in\u00a0 strict accord with the principles of abstract justice.\u00a0\u00a0 On the\u00a0 contrary, the maxim here is <i>Ignorantia facti excusat <\/i>(\"Ignorance or\u00a0 mistake in point of fact is, in all cases of supposed offense, a sufficient excuse\").\u00a0 (Brown's Leg. Max., 2d ed., 190.)<br\/><br\/>Since evil intent is in general an\u00a0 inseparable element in every crime, any\u00a0 such mistake of fact as shows\u00a0 the act committed to have proceeded from\u00a0 no sort\u00a0 of evil\u00a0 in the mind necessarily relieves the actor from\u00a0 criminal liability, provided\u00a0 always there is no fault or negligence\u00a0 on his part; and as laid down by Baron Parke,\u00a0 \"The guilt of the accused must depend on the circumstances as they\u00a0 appear to him.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Reg. <i>vs.<\/i> Thurborn, 1 Den.

J., in the Massachusetts court, once said: \"If the party killing had reasonable grounds for believing that the person slain had a felonious design against him, and under that supposition killed him, although it should afterwards\u00a0 appear\u00a0 that there was no such design, it will not be murder,\u00a0 but it will\u00a0 be either manslaughter or excusable homicide, according to the degree\u00a0 of caution used and the probable grounds of such belief.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Charge to the grand\u00a0 jury in Self ridge's\u00a0 case, Whart.\u00a0 Horn., 417, 418, Lloyd's report of the case, p. 7.)<br\/><br\/>In this case, Parker, J., charging the petit jury, enforced the doctrine as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A, in the peaceable pursuit of his affairs, sees B\u00a0 rushing rapidly toward him, with an outstretched arm and\u00a0 a\u00a0 pistol in his hand, and using violent menaces against his life as\u00a0 he advances. Having approached near enough in the same attitude, A, who has a club in his\u00a0 hand, strikes B over the head before or at the instant the pistol is discharge; and of the wound B dies.

second, that the trial court erred in failing to set out in its decision the\u00a0 finding of\u00a0 facts upon\u00a0 which the judgment rests;\u00a0 third,\u00a0 that the evidence of record does not\u00a0 sustain a finding that the defendant\u00a0 did in fact assume responsibility for the payment of the\u00a0 purchase price of the lumber delivered to his\u00a0 contractor; and fourth,\u00a0 that even if it be held that he\u00a0 did so, then\u00a0 since the alleged promise, as\u00a0 set up by plaintiffs\u00a0 in their\u00a0 evidence, merely guaranteed payment for the lumber and was\u00a0 not in writing, proof\u00a0 thereof was\u00a0 not admissible in evidence,\u00a0 and defendant was\u00a0 not bound thereby, under the provisions of section 335 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>The alleged errors of procedure may\u00a0 be dismissed without much discussion.\u00a0 We think a\u00a0 reading of the judgment itself clearly discloses that the trial judge did in\u00a0 fact make the necessary findings of fact, and that he expressly held that,\u00a0 admitting\u00a0 all the evidence\u00a0 offered by both parties, the evidence of record establishes\u00a0 the existence of defendant's promise to pay for the lumber,\u00a0 and discloses\u00a0 the existence of a balance due on account of the lumber delivered to defendant's contractor.\u00a0 Without considering whether, under\u00a0 the pleadings, the\u00a0 defendant's evidence should have been stricken out of the record and his motion to amend his answer denied, as appears to have been the opinion of the\u00a0 trial court, we agree with the trial\u00a0 court that even if the\u00a0 evidence be admitted and the complaint amended, the weight\u00a0 of\u00a0 all\u00a0 the evidence,\u00a0 including\u00a0 the evidence\u00a0 thus admitted, supports the plaintiffs' allegations\u00a0 touching defendant's promise to pay for the lumber in question, and establishes\u00a0 his contention that this lumber was in\u00a0 fact delivered to the defendant's contractor, and by him used in the\u00a0 construction of the house under the directions of the defendant,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that\u00a0 the amount for which the judgment was given in the court below was the amount of the unpaid purchase price of the lumber thus delivered.\u00a0 If, therefore, it was error of the trial court to rule that defendant's evidence should be stricken from the record and that defendant's answer should not be amended in\u00a0 accordance with a motion\u00a0 for\u00a0 that purpose made three weeks after judgment was rendered, it was\u00a0 at most error without prejudice.<br\/><br\/>The only question that remains is defendant's contention that his alleged guaranty of payment of the purchase price of the lumber\u00a0 furnished at\u00a0 his request to his contractor Kabalsa not being in writing, it\u00a0 is unenforceable in this action.<br\/><br\/>Section 335 of Act\u00a0 No. 190 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"In the following\u00a0 cases an agreement\u00a0 hereafter made shall\u00a0 be\u00a0 unenforceable by action unless the same, or some note or memorandum\u00a0 thereof, be in writing, and subscribed by the party charged, or by his agent;

But, on the other hand, if the promise is collateral to the agreement of another and\u00a0 the promisor becomes\u00a0 thereby merely a surety, the promise must be\u00a0 in writing.\u00a0 (Gull <i>vs.<\/i> Lindsay, 4\u00a0 Exch.\u00a0 45; and other\u00a0 cases\u00a0 cited\u00a0 under\u00a0 note 2, p. 906, Encyclopedia of Law, vol.\u00a0 29.)<br\/><br\/>Just what is\u00a0 the\u00a0 character of a promise as original\u00a0 or collateral is a question of law and fact\u00a0 which must\u00a0 in\u00a0 each case be determined\u00a0 from the evidence\u00a0 as to the language used in making the promise, and\u00a0 the circumstances under which the promise was made;\u00a0 and, since as a general rule the parties\u00a0 making a promise of this nature rarely understand the legal and technical difference between an\u00a0 original and\u00a0 a collateral promise, the precise form of words used, even when established by undisputed testimony is not always conclusive.\u00a0 So\u00a0 that it is said that \"While, as a matter\u00a0 of law, a promise, absolute in form, to pay or to be 'responsible' or to be the 'paymaster,' is an\u00a0 original promise, and while, on the other hand,\u00a0 if the promisor says, 'I will see you paid,' or 'I will pay if he does not,' or uses\u00a0 equivalent words, the promise standing alone is collateral, yet under all\u00a0 the circumstances\u00a0 of the case,\u00a0 an\u00a0 absolute\u00a0 promise to pay, or a promise to be 'responsible,'\u00a0 may be found to be collateral, or promises deemed <i>prima facie<\/i> collateral may be adjudged original.\"\u00a0 (Encyclopedia of Law, 2d\u00a0 ed., vol. 29,\u00a0 p. 907, and many cases there cited.)<br\/><br\/>If goods are sold upon the sole credit and responsibility of the party who makes the promise, then, even though they be delivered to a third person, there is no liability of the third person to which that of the party promising\u00a0 can be collateral, and\u00a0 consequently such a\u00a0 promise to pay\u00a0 does not require a\u00a0 memorandum in writing; and on the same principle it has been held that when one\u00a0 advances\u00a0 money at the request of\u00a0 another\u00a0 (on his promise to repay it) to pay the debt of a third party, as the payment creates\u00a0 no debt against such third party, not being made at all upon his credit, the liability of the party on whose\u00a0 request and promise it was made is original and not collateral, and not within\u00a0 the Statute\u00a0 of\u00a0 Frauds.\u00a0 (Pearce <i> vs<\/i>. Blagrave, 3 Com. Law, 338; Prop'rs. of Upper Locks vs. Abbott, 14 N. H., 157.)\u00a0 But it has been said that if the person for whose benefit\u00a0 the promise\u00a0 is made was himself liable at all, the promise of the defendant must be in\u00a0 writing.\u00a0\u00a0 (Matson <i>vs.<\/i> Wharam, 2 T. R., 80.)\u00a0\u00a0 And the text writers point out that if this rule be understood as confined to cases where'a third party and the defendant are liable in the same way, and to do the same thing, one as principal and the other as surety, it may be accepted as the uniform doctrine of all the cases both in\u00a0 England and in the United States.\u00a0 (Browne on the Statute of Frauds, par. 197, and cases there cited.)\u00a0\u00a0 In such cases, the defendant is said to come in aid to procure the credit to\u00a0 be given\u00a0 to the principal\u00a0 debtor, and the question, therefore,\u00a0 ultimately\u00a0 is \"upon whose credit the goods were sold or the money advanced, or whatever other thing done which the defendant by his promise procured to be done;\" and where the defendant stands\u00a0 in the relation to the third party of surety\u00a0 to principal \"if any\u00a0 credit at all be given to the third party, the defendant's promise\u00a0 is required to be in writing as collateral.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Browne on the Statute of Frauds, p. 227, and notes 2 and 4.)\u00a0 But it must be clearly recognized that these\u00a0 principles\u00a0 are applicable only where the parties are liable in the same way to do the same thing, one as principal and the other as surety, for if the credit is given to both jointly, since neither can be said to be surety for the other to the creditor, their engagement need not be in writing.<br\/><br\/>As has been\u00a0 said before, it is frequently a matter of difficulty to determine to whom the credit has actually been given, whether\u00a0 to\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 alone, in which case\u00a0 the debt is his own and his promise\u00a0 is good without writing; or in\u00a0 part to the third party, in which case the defendant's promise being collateral to and in aid of the third party's liability, requires a writing to support it, or to both jointly, in which\u00a0 case as has been said their engagement need\u00a0 not be in writing.\u00a0\u00a0 This must be determined from the language and expressions used by the parties promising, and from an\u00a0 examination of the circumstances showing the\u00a0 understanding of the parties.\u00a0 The unexplained fact that charges were\u00a0 made against a third party on the plaintiffs' books, or that the bill was presented to the original\u00a0 debtor in\u00a0 the first instance, unqualified\u00a0 by special circumstances,\u00a0 tends to prove that the credit was given in whole\u00a0 or in part to him, and\u00a0 that the defendant's promise is a collateral one. (Larson <i>vs<\/i>. Wyman, 14 Wend. (N. Y.), 246;\u00a0 Pennell\u00a0 <i>vs.<\/i> Pentz, 4 E. D. Smith (N. Y.), 639.)\u00a0\u00a0 But it is evidently quite\u00a0 impossible to specify any one fact or set\u00a0 of facts on which the question as to whom the plaintiff gave credit is to be\u00a0 determined.\u00a0\u00a0 In the language of Buchanan, C.\u00a0 J., in Elder <i>vs.<\/i> Warfield (7 Harris &amp; J.\u00a0 (Md.), 397), \"the extent of the undertaking, the expression used, the situation of the parties, and\u00a0 all the circumstances of the case should be taken into consideration.\"<br\/><br\/>Application of these principles\u00a0 has been made in many cases\u00a0 where owners of buildings going up under contract enter\u00a0 into agreements\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 faith of which subcontractors or others have continued to supply labor or material after the principal contractor has become either actually or probably unable\u00a0 to\u00a0 pay.\u00a0 In these cases,\u00a0 the question is whether the services for which the action is brought against the owner\u00a0 of the building were performed solely upon the credit of his promise, to be himself responsible and to pay for the\u00a0 materials and labor furnished, or whether the subcontractors and\u00a0 laborers continued to furnish labor\u00a0 and materials\u00a0\u00a0 to the principal\u00a0 contractor relying\u00a0 upon\u00a0 his obligation guaranteed by the promise of the owner.\u00a0\u00a0 (Gill <i>vs<\/i>.

L., 17.)<br\/><br\/>Taking\u00a0 into consideration\u00a0 all the circumstances of the case at\u00a0 bar, we are satisfied that\u00a0 the credit for the lumber delivered by the\u00a0 plaintiffs to defendant's\u00a0 contractor was extended solely and\u00a0 exclusively to the defendant under the verbal agreement had with\u00a0 him, and therefore, that the provisions\u00a0 of the statute did not\u00a0 require that\u00a0 it should be made in writing.\u00a0 Defendant admitted on the stand that his contractor had no commercial credit or standing in the community, and it appears that plaintiffs,\u00a0 after investigation, absolutely refused to extend\u00a0 him any\u00a0 credit\u00a0 whatever upon\u00a0 any conditions\u00a0 and that\u00a0 the defendant was well aware of that fact.\u00a0 From the testimony\u00a0 of the contractor himself, it\u00a0 seems clear that when the\u00a0 agreement for the delivery of lumber\u00a0 was made,\u00a0 the\u00a0 credit was extended\u00a0 not to\u00a0 the contractor\u00a0 but to the\u00a0 defendant.\u00a0 It appears that\u00a0 both plaintiffs and\u00a0 defendant exercised especial precautions to see that all the\u00a0 lumber was\u00a0 delivered on\u00a0 defendant's lot, and that before each bill of lumber was delivered, defendant carefully examined the\u00a0 invoice, which by\u00a0 agreement was submitted to him, and that no lumber was delivered without his approval.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 precise language in which\u00a0 the\u00a0 verbal agreement was made does not appear\u00a0 fvom the evidence, and while\u00a0 it is true that one of the plaintiffs in his deposition, made in the United States, refers to the agreement as\u00a0 one\u00a0 whereby defendant \"guaranteed\" payment for the lumber, we are satisfied from\u00a0 all the\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 that the word was\u00a0 not\u00a0 used by this witness\u00a0 in\u00a0 its\u00a0 technical sense, and that he did not mean thereby to say that defendant guaranteed payment by the\u00a0 contractor, but rather that after satisfying plaintiffs as to his\u00a0 own financial responsibility, he obligated himself to pay for the lumber delivered to his contractor for use in his\u00a0 house.\u00a0\u00a0 The only evidence in the whole record which tends to put our conclusion in this regard in\u00a0 doubt, is the testimony of plaintiffs'\u00a0 acting manager during plaintiffs' absence in the United States who stated that he\u00a0 sent a statement of account and\u00a0 a bill for the lumber to\u00a0 the contractor; but this\u00a0 fact, which under ordinary circumstances would be strong evidence that the credit was\u00a0 originally extended to the contractor and merely guaranteed by\u00a0 the defendant, was satisfactorily\u00a0 and sufficiently explained by proof that the plaintiffs were compelled to leave for the United States quite\u00a0 unexpectedly, with no opportunity to\u00a0 go over the\u00a0 accounts\u00a0 with their\u00a0 acting manager, who was left in charge, so that the latter having no\u00a0 knowledge\u00a0 whatever as to plaintiffs' agreement with defendant,\u00a0 and learning that lumber had been delivered to the contractor, supposed that it\u00a0 had been sold to him, and only discovered his mistake on later investigation and correspondence with his principals, after the contractor had notified him as to the true nature of the transaction.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from should be affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.\u00a0 J., Torres,\u00a0 Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Thereupon Pintu went out of the\u00a0 house, and Labai, taking advantage of his absence, carried away the latter's shotgun and, thus armed, started for the place where he thought his sweetheart Salong would be with his rival, and found Salong in\u00a0 a\u00a0 vinta or\u00a0 small boat, sitting under cover beside her sister Saoda,\u00a0 who\u00a0 was lying\" down.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant then rested one knee on the ground\u00a0 in order to take sure aim and in this posture discharged his gun at his said sweetheart, wounding her in the right side,\u00a0 and also her sister Saoda by the same shot.\u00a0 Neither of the injured women had previously observed the assault made upon them, notwithstanding the fact that Labai fired the shot at very\u00a0 close range, said to\u00a0 be 3 feet.\u00a0 As a result of the wound inflicted Salong died five hours afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0 Two witnesses, Ungal and Saoda, were present during the commission . of the crime and, immediately after the report of the gun, saw, from the vinta where\u00a0 they were, the defendant still with one knee on the ground\u00a0 and the shotgun\u00a0 pointed at his victim.<br\/><br\/>By reason of the foregoing facts, the assistant fiscal of the Moro Province filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of the\u00a0 said\u00a0 province,\u00a0 charging Labai with the crime of murder, and the present cause having come to trial,\u00a0 the court, in view of the evidence introduced, rendered judgment on February 16, 1910,\u00a0 sentencing the defendant to the penalty of death by hanging, to pay to the heirs of the deceased an indemnity of Pl,000, and the costs of the trial.\u00a0\u00a0 The judgment also provided\u00a0 that the said penalty should be executed in the public square of the municipality of Malabang, in which district the crime was committed, on\u00a0 a\u00a0 date to be\u00a0 subsequently fixed.\u00a0 The\u00a0 records in this case were forwarded to this\u00a0 court for review of the said judgment.<br\/><br\/>From the facts related, which\u00a0 were fully proven at the trial of the present cause,\u00a0 it is concluded that the crime of murder was committed against\u00a0 the person\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Moro woman named\u00a0 Salong,\u00a0 a crime provided for\u00a0 and punished by article 403\u00a0 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as a wound of a serious and\u00a0 mortal character was inflicted in the right side of her body by a\u00a0 shot discharged from a shotgun at very close range while she\u00a0 was sitting in a vinta, unwarned and without having noticed that she was to be assaulted in a treacherous manner; for the aggressor, in order to get a good aim and successfully carry out his criminal purpose, knelt with one knee\u00a0 on the ground,\u00a0 thus employing ways and means in the execution of the crime directly to insure the consummation thereof, without risk to his person from any defense which the victim might have offered.\u00a0 The defendant therefore committed the crime with treachery, which circumstance qualifies the\u00a0 act of the violent death of the offended party and determines the imposition of the severer penalty provided by the said article.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of two eyewitnesses to the criminal act and other evidence of record prove in a\u00a0 satisfactory and\u00a0 conclusive manner that the Moro Labai was the sole perpetrator by direct participation, fully convicted,\u00a0 of the said crime. His denial and exculpatory allegations, absolutely devoid of proof, can not overcome the evidence\u00a0 produced against him by the prosecution.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is,\u00a0 therefore, not true that, as a result of a struggle\u00a0 with\u00a0 Amay\u00a0 Lampukan, the shotgun which they were wrestling over was accidentally discharged, the shot striking the\u00a0 deceased.<br\/><br\/>In fact, the eyewitnesses named Ungal and Saoda affirmed that immediately after\u00a0 they heard the\u00a0 discharge of the shotgun they saw the defendant with\u00a0 the weapon\u00a0 still pointed at his victim and\u00a0 with\u00a0 one knee resting on the ground, in which position he had placed himself in order to insure the effect of the\u00a0 shot.\u00a0 These witnesses denied that there was any dispute or struggle between the defendant Labai and Amay\u00a0 Lampukan, as alleged\u00a0 by the former without the slightest\u00a0 proof\u00a0 in corroboration of his allegation;\u00a0 wherefore it is\u00a0 incontrovertible that\u00a0 the defendant Labai, instead of attacking Dangalug, whom, he testified, the deceased Salong, his sweetheart, was to have married, he sought out the latter and fired upon her with the shotgun which he took from the house of the\u00a0 Moro Pintu.<br\/><br\/>In the perpetration of the said crime, it is proper, to consider the\u00a0 presence\u00a0 of the aggravating circumstance of premeditation, which is proved by the conduct of the accused who,\u00a0 after having consulted Pintu as to what\u00a0 he Labai, ought to do in view of the news of the approaching marriage of his sweetheart Salong with the said Dangalug, took the shotgun which he found in the house of the aformentioned Pintu, after the latter\u00a0 had gone out, and provided with the said firearm, started to look for his victim, thus showing by his acts that he had decided to kill, as he did, the girl Salong. This aggravating circumstance\u00a0 is compensated in its effects by the special extenuating circumstance of article 11 of the Penal Code,\u00a0 by\u00a0 reason of the\u00a0 uncivilized\u00a0 customs of the race to which the\u00a0 defendant belongs, his\u00a0 personal conditions, and his lack of education, circumstances which perfectly harmonize with the spirit of the provision contained in the said article 11 of the Penal\u00a0 Code of the Islands,\u00a0 The aggravating circumstance No. 24 of article 10 of\u00a0 the code can not be considered as having been present, inasmuch as, in accordance with the laws in force, among them, Act No. 1780 of the Philippine Commission, the possession or use of firearms and other weapons therein specified as\u00a0 prohibited without license\u00a0 constitutes a crime specially\u00a0 punished by the same, and therefore the possession or use\u00a0 of a firearm without license can not\u00a0 be considered merely as an aggravating circumstance.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the errors imputed to the judgment under review, it is to be noted that, in the amended complaint, only the crime of murder is\u00a0 charged, and mention is made, as an additional fact resulting from\u00a0 the assault, of the wound inflicted upon the Moro Saoda by the same shot which occasioned the death of Salong, although, if the provincial fiscal had charged the\u00a0 defendant with murder and lesiones, not on such\u00a0 account would the\u00a0 complaint have\u00a0 been\u00a0 defective, under the provisions of section 11 of General Orders, No. 58, in connection with article 89 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 The rest of the errors assigned\u00a0 to\u00a0 the judgment of the lower court\u00a0 have been\u00a0 disposed of by the statements made in this decision.<br\/><br\/>Therefore\u00a0 the penalty, in its\u00a0 medium\u00a0 degree, provided by law for the crime of murder, must be imposed upon the defendant, since the aforementioned\u00a0 aggravating: and extenuating circumstances compensate\u00a0 each\u00a0 other in\u00a0 their effects, and, therefore, it is proper, in our opinion, with a reversal\u00a0 of the judgment reviewed, to sentence the Moro Labai, as we hereby do, to the penalty\u00a0 of life imprisonment, to the accessory penalties, Nos. 2 and\u00a0 3 of article 54 of the code, to\u00a0 pay an\u00a0 indemnity\u00a0 of\u00a0 P1,000 to\u00a0 the heirs of the deceased, and the costs\u00a0 of both instances.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

AGUSTINA JARRA, ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE ESTATE OF MAGDALENO JIMENEA, DECEASED, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT,.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the 1st of September, 1906, Felix de los Santos brought suit against Agustina Jarra, the administratrix of the estate of Magdaleno Jimenea, alleging that in the latter part of 1901\u00a0 Jimenea\u00a0 borrowed\u00a0 and obtained from\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff ten first-class carabaos, to be used at the animal-power mill of his hacienda during the season of 1901-2, without recompense or remuneration whatever for the use thereof, under the sole condition that they should be returned to the owner as soon as the work at the mill was terminated; that Magdaleno Jimenea, however, did not return the carabaos, notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiff claimed their return after\u00a0 the work\u00a0 at\u00a0 the mill was\u00a0 finished;\u00a0 that Magdaleno Jimenea died\u00a0 on the 28th of October, 1904,\u00a0 and the defendant herein\u00a0 was appointed by the\u00a0 Court\u00a0 of First Instance of\u00a0 Occidental\u00a0 Negros administratrix of his\u00a0 estate and she took\u00a0 over\u00a0 the administration of the\u00a0 same and is still performing her duties as such administratrix; that the plaintiff presented\u00a0 his claim to the commissioners of the estate of Jimenea, within the legal term, for the return of the said ten carabaos, but the said commissioners rejected his claim as appears in their report; therefore, the plaintiff prayed that judgment be entered against the defendant as administratrix of the estate of the deceased, ordering her to return the ten first-class carabaos loaned to the late Jimenea, or their present value, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendant was duly summoned, and on the 25th of September, 1906, she demurred in writing to the complaint on the ground that\u00a0 it was vague; but on the 2d of October of the same year, in answer to the complaint, she said that it was true that the\u00a0 late Magdaleno Jimenea\u00a0 asked the plaintiff to loan him ten carabaos, but that he only obtained three\u00a0 second-class animals, which were afterwards\u00a0 transferred by sale by the plaintiff to the said Jimenea; that she denied the allegations contained in paragraph 3\u00a0 of the complaint;\u00a0 for all of which she asked the court to absolve her of the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>By a writing dated the 11th of December, 1906, Attorney Jose Felix Martinez notified the defendant and her counsel, Matias Hilado, that\u00a0 he had made an agreement with the plaintiff to the effect that the latter would not compromise the controversy without his consent, and that as fees for his professional services he was to\u00a0 receive one half of the amount allowed in the judgment if the\u00a0 same were entered in favor of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The case came up for trial,\u00a0 evidence was adduced by both parties, and their exhibits were made of record.\u00a0 On the 10th of January, 1907, the court below entered judgment sentencing Agustina\u00a0 Jarra, as administratrix of the estate of Magdaleno\u00a0 Jimenea, to return to the plaintiff, Felix de los\u00a0 Santos, the remaining six second and third class carabaos, or the value thereof at the rate of ^=120 each,\u00a0 or a total of P720 with the\u00a0 costs.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendant excepted to the foregoing judgment,\u00a0 and, by\u00a0 a\u00a0 writing dated January 19, moved for a new trial on the\u00a0 ground that the findings\u00a0 of\u00a0 fact were openly and manifestly contrary to the\u00a0 weight of the\u00a0 evidence. The motion was overruled, the\u00a0 defendant duly excepted, and in due course submitted the corresponding bill of exceptions, which was approved and submitted to\u00a0 this court.<br\/><br\/>The defendant\u00a0 has\u00a0 admitted that\u00a0 Magdaleno Jimenea asked the plaintiff for the loan of ten carabaos\u00a0 which are now claimed by the latter, as shown by two letters addressed by the said Jimenea to Felix de los Santos; but in her answer the said defendant alleged that the late Jimenea only obtained three second-class carabaos, which were subsequently sold to\u00a0 him by the owner, Santos; therefore, in order to decide this litigation it is indispensable thatproof be forthcoming that\u00a0 Jimenea only received three carabaos from his son-in-law Santos, and that they were sold by the latter to him.<br\/><br\/>The record discloses that it has been fully proven from the testimony of a sufficient number of\u00a0 witnesses\u00a0 that\u00a0 the plaintiff,\u00a0 Santos, sent in charge of various persons the ten carabaos\u00a0 requested by\u00a0 his\u00a0 father-in-law,\u00a0 Magdaleno\u00a0 Jimenea, in the two letters produced at the trial by the plaintiff, and that Jimenea received them in the presence of some of said persons, one being a brother of said Jimenea, who saw the animals arrive at the hacienda where it was proposed to employ them.\u00a0\u00a0 Four died of rinderpest, and it is for this reason that the judgment appealed from only deals with six surviving carabaos.<br\/><br\/>The alleged purchase of three carabaos by Jimenea from his son-in-law Santos is not evidenced by any trustworthy documents such as those of transfer, nor were the declarations of the witnesses presented by the defendant affirming it satisfactory; for said reason it can not be considered that Jimenea only received three carabaos on loan from his son-in-law, and that he afterwards kept them definitely\u00a0 by virtue of the purchase.<br\/><br\/>By the\u00a0 laws in force the transfer of large cattle was and is still made by means\u00a0 of official documents issued by the local authorities; these documents constitute the title\u00a0 of ownership^ the carabao or horse so\u00a0 acquired.\u00a0 Furthermore, not only\u00a0 should the purchaser be provided with a new certificate or credential, a document which has not been produced\u00a0 in evidence by\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant, nor has\u00a0 the loss of the same been shown in the case,\u00a0 but the old documents ought to be on file in the municipality,\u00a0 or they should have been\u00a0 delivered to\u00a0 the new purchaser,\u00a0 and in the case\u00a0 at bar neither did the defendant present the old credential\u00a0 on which should be stated the name of\u00a0 the previous owner of each of the three carabaos said to have been sold by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing it may be logically inferred that the carabaos loaned or given on commodatum\u00a0 to the now deceased Magdaleno Jimenea were ten\u00a0 in number; that they, or at any rate the six surviving ones, have not been returned to the owner thereof, Felix de los\u00a0 Santos,\u00a0 and that it is not true that the latter sold to the\u00a0 former three carabaos that the purchaser was already using; therefore, as the said six carabaos were not the property of the deceased nor of any of his descendants,\u00a0 it is\u00a0 the\u00a0 duty of the administratrix of the estate to return them\u00a0 or indemnify\u00a0 the owner for their value.<br\/><br\/>The Civil Code, in dealing with loans\u00a0 in general, from which generic denomination the specific one of commodatum is derived, establishes\u00a0 prescriptions in relation to the last-mentioned contract by the following articles :<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 1740. By the contract of loan, one of the\u00a0 parties delivers to\u00a0 the\u00a0 other, either\u00a0 anything not perishable, in order that the latter may use it during a certain period and return it to the former, in which case it is called commodatum,\u00a0 or money\u00a0 or any other\u00a0 perishable\u00a0 thing,\u00a0 under the condition\u00a0 to return an equal amount of the same kind and quality, in which case it is merely\u00a0 called a loan.<br\/><br\/>\"Commodatum is essentially gratuitous.<br\/><br\/>\"A simple loan may\u00a0 be\u00a0 gratuitous, or made, under\u00a0 a stipulation to pay interest.<br\/><br\/>\"Art, 1741. The bailor retains the ownership of the thing loaned.\u00a0 The bailee acquires the\u00a0 use thereof, but\u00a0 not its fruits j if\u00a0 any compensation is involved, to be paid by the person requiring the\u00a0 use,\u00a0 the agreement ceases to\u00a0 be\u00a0 a commodatum.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 1742. The obligations and rights\u00a0 which arise from the commodatum pass to\u00a0 the heirs of\u00a0 both contracting parties, unless the loan has been made in\u00a0 consideration for the person of the bailee, in which case his heirs shall not have the right to continue using the thing\u00a0 loaned.\"<\/blockquote>The earabaos delivered to be used not being returned by the defendant upon demand, there is no doubt that she is under obligation to indemnify\u00a0 the\u00a0 owner thereof by paying him their value.<br\/><br\/>Article\u00a0 1101 of said code reads:<br\/><br\/>\"Those\u00a0 who in fulfilling their obligations are guilty of fraud, negligence, or delay, and those who in\u00a0 any manner whatsoever act in contravention of the stipulations of the same, shall be\u00a0 subject to indemnify\u00a0 for the losses\u00a0 and damages caused thereby.\"<br\/><br\/>The obligation of the bailee or of his successors to return either the thing loaned\u00a0 or its value,\u00a0 is sustained by\u00a0 the supreme tribunal of Spain.\u00a0 In its\u00a0 decision of March 21, 1895, it sets out with precision the legal doctrine touching commodatum as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Although it\u00a0 is true that in a contract\u00a0 of commodatum the bailor retains the ownership of the thing loaned, and at the expiration of the period, or after the use for which it was loaned has been accomplished,\u00a0 it is the imperative duty of the bailee to return the thing itself to its owner, or to pay him damages if through the\u00a0 fault of the bailee the thing\u00a0 should have been lost or\u00a0 injured,\u00a0 it is clear\u00a0 that where public\u00a0 securities\u00a0 are involved,\u00a0 the trial court,\u00a0 in deferring to the claim of the bailor that the amount loaned \"be returned him by the\u00a0 bailee in bonds of the same class as those which\u00a0 constituted the contract, thereby properly applies law 9 of title 11 of <i>partida<\/i> 5.\"<\/blockquote>With regard to the third assignment of error, based\u00a0 on the fact that the plaintiff Santos had not appealed from the decision\u00a0 of the\u00a0 commissioners rejecting his claim\u00a0 for\u00a0 the recovery of his carabaos,\u00a0 it is sufficient to state that we are not dealing\u00a0 with a claim for the payment\u00a0 of a certain sum,\u00a0 the collection of a\u00a0 debt from the estate,\u00a0 or payment for losses and damages (sec. 119, Code of Civil Procedure), but with the exclusion from\u00a0 the inventory of the property of the late Jimenea,\u00a0 or\u00a0 from his\u00a0 capital,\u00a0 of\u00a0 six carabaos which did not belong to him, and which formed no part of the inheritance.<br\/><br\/>The demand for the exclusion of the said carabaos belonging to a third party\u00a0 and which did not form part of\u00a0 the property of the deceased, must be the\u00a0 subject of a direct decision of the court in an ordinary action, wherein the right of the third party to the property which he seeks\u00a0 to have excluded from the inheritance and the right of the deceased his been discussed, and\u00a0 rendered in view\u00a0 of the result\u00a0 of the evidence adduced by the administrator of the estate and of the claimant, since\u00a0 it\u00a0 is so provided by the\u00a0 second part of section. 699 and by section 703 of\u00a0 the Code of Civil Procedure; the refusal of the\u00a0 commissioners before whom the plaintiff unnecessarily appeared can not\u00a0 affect nor reduce the\u00a0 unquestionable\u00a0 right of ownership\u00a0 of the latter, inasmuch as there is no law nor principle of justice authorizing the\u00a0 successors\u00a0 of the\u00a0 late Jimenea to enrich themselves at the cost and to the prejudice of Felix de los Santos.<br\/><br\/>For\u00a0 the reasons\u00a0 above\u00a0 set forth, by which the\u00a0 errors assigned to the judgment appealed from have been refuted, and considering that\u00a0 the same is in accordance with the law and the merits of\u00a0 the case,\u00a0 it is our opinion that it should\u00a0 be affirmed and we do hereby affirm it with the costs against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.\u00a0 J.,\u00a0 Johnson,\u00a0 Moreland,<\/i>\u00a0 and\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Elliott,\u00a0 JJ.,<\/span> concur.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Carson, J.,<\/span> reserved his vote.<br\/><\/div>",

that the said vessel San Gabriel while proceeding and being taken by the said accused, Pedro Eduardo, upon the voyage to Corregidor, as aforesaid,\u00a0 and while within the\u00a0 waters of Manila Bay and beyond the harbor limits of the city of Manila, by reason of being so overloaded by the accused, as aforesaid,\u00a0 and by reason and\u00a0 because of the unseaworthy condition\u00a0 of\u00a0 her hull, as aforesaid, and by reason\u00a0 of bein&amp; then and there a vessel of less than 96 tons burden, was unable\u00a0 to resist the severe storm and stress of weather aforesaid and was then and there wrecked, foundered, and sunk in the waters of Manila Bay, whereby said Erisberta Garrido and others whose names are unknown were then and there drowned.<br\/><br\/>\"That the said vessel <i>San Gabriel <\/i>was unable, by reason of said foundering and shipwreck, to come into any port of the Philippine Islands after she sailed from the said port of Manila, but the said Pedro Eduardo was rescued\u00a0 and brought to the city of Manila on the 19th day of July, 1908, on the steam launch <i>De la Rama,<\/i> duly licensed and registered in the Philippine Islands,\u00a0 under the\u00a0 laws thereof;

That said launch San Gabriel was a launch constructed of wood, with a gross tonnage of 43.94 tons, and on the 16th\u00a0 of\u00a0 July, 1908, was licensed\u00a0 to carry thirty passengers only, together with a crew composed of eleven persons, composed of one captain, one machinist, four firemen, and five sailors.<br\/><br\/>Third. That on the said 16th of July, 1908, said launch was\u00a0 anchored in the Pasig River, in the\u00a0 city\u00a0 of\u00a0 Manila; that the hold was filled with freight and additional freight was\u00a0 piled upon the deck; that a policeman who was near the place where the said launch was anchored just before the time of raising said anchor, forbade the captain from taking any more freight on\u00a0 board, because of the then overloaded condition of said launch.<br\/><br\/>Fourth. That there was on board said launch\u00a0 at the time it sailed out of the Pasig River into Manila Bay, about one hundred\u00a0 passengers, more or less, among whom was one Erisberta Garrido, a child of tender years.<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 That there were no cabins for passengers on said launch, and that all the passengers were required to remain on deck, and that the launch was a single-deck launch.<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 That at and before the time\u00a0 (16th of July, 1908) the said launch raised anchor, the ,second storm signal was displayed at the usual place for displaying such signals in the city of Manila, knowledge of which the defendant had.<br\/><br\/>Seventh. That the defendant had full knowledge of the provisions of the Customs Administrative Circular, No. 436, issued by the Hon.\u00a0 H. B.\u00a0 McCoy, Acting Insular Collector of Customs,\u00a0 which contains\u00a0 the following precautions\u00a0 to captains\u00a0 of vessels when the second\u00a0 storm signal is displayed:<br\/><blockquote>\"Vessels shall strengthen their moorings.\u00a0 It is deemed advisable that vessels shall send down light yards and masts. Steamers shall be ready to use their engines on short notice. Dangerous for small vessels to be in the bay.\u00a0 Bancas must not leave the river.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Eighth, That the son of the owner of the vessel, Andres Gabriel, who had\u00a0 under his control\u00a0 the\u00a0 disposition\u00a0 and direction of\u00a0 said launch, on the afternoon of the 15th of July, 1908, in view of the\u00a0 bad condition of the weather, advised the machinist and the said captain, that they should not go out of the river on the following day.<br\/><br\/>Ninth. That a few days\u00a0 before the said 16th of July, 1908, the said launch had collided with the stone wall or embankment of the Pasig River with\u00a0 such force as might have weakened the frame of said launch.<br\/><br\/>Tenth. That notwithstanding\u00a0 the instructions of the son of the owner of said\u00a0 launch given to the defendant not to leave the river on the 16th of July, 1908; and notwithstanding the fact that the\u00a0 hold was filled with freight and that additional freight was piled upon the single deck of said launch;\u00a0 and notwithstanding the fact\u00a0 that the\u00a0 launch was loaded with one hundred passengers,\u00a0 more or less,\u00a0 being more than three times the number which she was permitted to\u00a0 carry; and notwithstanding\u00a0 the fact that\u00a0 the\u00a0 second storm\u00a0 signal had\u00a0 been displayed several hours; and notwithstanding\u00a0 the fact that the\u00a0 defendant knew that the second storm\u00a0 signal had been displayed and was then displayed, he raised anchor and\u00a0\u00a0 left\u00a0 the\u00a0 Pasig\u00a0 River and steamed out\u00a0 into Manila Bay,\u00a0 where, after two or more hours of sailing in the direction of Corregidor Island, in the face of a severe storm, the said\u00a0 launch foundered and\u00a0 one Erisberta Garrido, a child of tender years, and dthers whose names are unknown,\u00a0 were then and there drowned; that ninety-five of the passengers who were on board the said launch at the time she foundered, and who were struggling in the water at or near the place where the said launch sunk, were rescued by other launches and bancas, which went to\u00a0 the scene for that\u00a0 purpose, the bodies of others being found a few days later on the shores of Manila Bay.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 theory of the prosecution is\u00a0 that the defendant is criminally liable under the provisions of article 568 of the Penal Code, in its first paragraph.\u00a0 Said article provides that \"he who shall execute t<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">hrough reckless negligence<\/span> an act that, if done with malice, would constitute\u00a0 a grave crime, shall be punished with the penalty of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">arresto mayor<\/span> in its maximum\u00a0 degree to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prision correccional<\/span> in\u00a0 its minimum degree, and with <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">arresto mayor<\/span> in its minimum and medium degrees if it shall constitute a less grave crime.\"<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 crime\u00a0 imputed to the\u00a0 defendant here is\u00a0 that he drowned Erisberta Garrido, which would, had it been done with malice, have constituted a grave crime.<br\/><br\/>The phrase \"reckless negligence\" is one most difficult to define.\u00a0 Many courts have attempted to define it.\u00a0 It seems impossible to\u00a0 give an\u00a0 exact definition of what constitutes \"reckless negligence.\"\u00a0 We do not attempt here to define it\u00a0 Each case must\u00a0 depend upon its own facts.\u00a0 We deem it sufficient, under the facts and circumstances of the present case, to hold that the defendant did, through his\u00a0 reckless negligence and without due regard for the safety of Erisberta Garrido and the other passengers on board the said launch\u00a0 <i>San Gabriel<\/i>, raise the anchor of said\u00a0 launch\u00a0 and steam out of the\u00a0 Pasig River into Manila Bay, in the face of a severe storm, while the boat was overloaded both with freight and passengers, where, by reason\u00a0 of said negligence and overloading, Erisberta Garrido was drowned.<br\/><br\/>In our conclusions we have taken into consideration the decisions of the supreme court of Spain of the 7th of March, 1871; the 13th of May, 1874; the 3d of May, 1876; the 23d of December, 1887, and the 18th of October, 1899.<br\/><br\/>After a full consideration of all of the\u00a0 facts and circumstances, we are of the opinion and so hold that the evidence shows,\u00a0 beyond peradventure of doubt, that the defendant is guilty of a violation of the provisions of said article 568 of the Penal Code, and that\u00a0 the penalty imposed\u00a0 by the lower court was in accordance with the provisions of law; it is, therefore, hereby affirmed, with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

Gil Gamao et al.,\"<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>\u00a0 for murder, illegally, maliciously, willfully, and falsely testified and declared, under oath, that on the 15th day of May, 1909, one Dionisio Tambolero came to his house in Japitan, within the jurisdiction of the municipality of, Escalante, in said province, at about 7 p. m. on the said 15th day of May, 1909, and that he remained in the house of the said accused (Lope Estrana) until the following day; when, as a matter of fact, and as the accused, Lope Estrafia, well knew, the said Dionisio Tambolero was not at Japitan on the said 15th day of May, 1909; all of which was in violation of the statutes in such case made and provided.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The accused was arraigned, plead not guilty, tried, convicted, and sentenced to be confined in the Insular penitentiary, for the period of one year and one day, and \"to hereafter be incapable of holding any public office or of giving testimony in any court of the Philippine Islands,\" and to pay the costs of the cause.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>The Roman Catholic priest in charge of the parish in the town of Escalante, Province of Occidental Negros, was. fatally wounded on the night of May 15, 1909, and died about 5 a. m. on the following morning. Subsequently thereto criminal case No. 1055, wherein the United States was plaintiff and Gill Gamao et al. were defendants, charged with the assassination of the said priest, was instituted in the Court of First Instance in the said province. The appellant, Lope Estrana, was called as a witness for the defense in said criminal case and after being duly sworn according to law, testified, among other things, that he wad then living in the barrio of Japitan, jurisdiction of the said town of Escalante, and that one Dionisio Tambolero came to his house in the said barrio about 7 p. m. on May 15, 1909, and remained there all night, leaving about 5 a. m. on the following morning. The prosecuting officers, believing this testimony to be false, filed a complaint against the appellant, charging him with the crime of perjury. On the trial of this case in the court below the appellant again testified that the said Tambolero passed the night of May 15, 1909, at his house, and called as witnesses to corroborate him on this point his wife and stepson who did in fact corroborate the testimony of the appellant, in that the said Tambolero came to the appellant's house and passed the night of May 15 there, but they could not specifically state the hour he left the following morning.<br\/><br\/>Dionisio Tambolero testified in this case that he did not know exactly where the defendant's house is situated in the barrio of Japitan and that he never was. at any time in the house of the defendant in the said barrio; that on the morning of the 15th of May, 1909, he went to the church in Escalante, heard mass, and returned to his house in the said town of Escalante; that at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon he returned to the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sacristia,<\/span> arriving there about 5 o'clock that afternoon, had a conversation with Natalio Inson about certain baptisms which had taken place on that afternoon, and that on leaving the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sacristia<\/span> he went to the store of one Jose Nieva and remained there until about 6.30 or 7 o'clock in the evening; that on leaving this store he returned to his own house and later went to the house of his <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">compadre;<\/span> that he and his family did not sleep in his own house on the night of May 15 on account of it being used for the storage of tobacco, but that they did sleep in the next house, which was owned by an employee of his; that the next morning, when he was informed by a policeman named Clemente Magallon of what had happened to the priest on the night before, he went direct to the convent, arriving there a few minutes after 5 o'clock; that within one-half hour after he arrived at the convent Gregorio Tudanca gave him some money and sent him to a Chinese store to buy nails to be used in making a casket for the deceased priest.<br\/><br\/>According to the testimony of this witness he did not leave the town of Escalante at any time during the night of May 15, 1909.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He was in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sacristia<\/span> of the church at 4 o'clock on the afternoon\u00a0 of May\u00a0 15,\u00a0 and\u00a0 was at the convent the following morning just a few minutes after 5 o'clock.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The testimony of this witness as to the time he was at the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sacristia<\/span> on the afternoon of the 15th of May is corroborated by the testimony of Natalio Inson, and his testimony with reference to the time he went to the convent on the following morning is corroborated in every particular by the testimony of Gregorio Tudanca, Celedonia Samonte, and Vicente Olmedo, all of whom testified positively that they saw the said Tambolero at the convent about 5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0o'clock on the morning of the 16th of May assisting in the preparation of the body of the deceased\u00a0 priest for interment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So\u00a0 it has been\u00a0 conclusively established that Dionisio Tambolero did not go to the house of the appellant in the barrio of Japitan on May 15, neither did. he spend the night of the\u00a0 15th of May in the appellant's house. Considering the distance from the appellant's house to the town of Escalante, which requires at least two and one-half hours, either by land or water, and the difficulties to be encountered in making this journey, it was a physical impossibility for Tambolero to have left the house of the appellant at the time stated by him (the appellant) and to have arrived at the convent at the time he appeared there to assist in the burial of the priest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellant, Lope Estrana, did therefore knowingly and intentionally testify falsely, under oath, before a legally constituted tribunal, when he swore that Tambolero passed the night of May 15 in his (appellant's) house.<br\/><br\/>The prosecution in this case is based on the said false testimony of the appellant given in. criminal case No. 1055. It may be inferred that Dionisio Tambolero was a material witness for the prosecution in said criminal case No. 1055. If said Tambolero did, in fact, testify as a witness for the prosecution in that case, the record of the case at bar fails to disclose what his testimony was. Tambolero did not state that he was a witness in the said murder case (No. 1055), neither did he make any reference to what he knew, if anything, about the commission of that murder; but on the contrary, reading his testimony alone, it would appear that he knew nothing about the facts surrounding the commission of that crime, as he stated that after leaving the Chinese store he went to his own house, slept in the house of one of his employees, and was informed the following morning1 by a policeman that the murder had been committed. The only reference to the testimony of Tambolero in said murder case appears in the appellant's brief, wherein his counsel states that \"In said case (referring to criminal case No. 1055) a witness for the prosecution, called Dionisio Tambolero, testified that on the night of May 15, 1909, when the murder was committed he saw Mauricio Gamao, with a bolo in his hand, come out of the lower part of the convent.\" (Mauricio Gamao was one of the defendants charged with the assassination of the priest in case No. 1055.) If this statement of counsel for the appellant be accepted as true, then Tambolero did testify that he saw one of the defendants in that case (No. 1055) on the night of the murder leaving the lower part of the convent with a bolo in his hand. This statement of counsel will be considered later.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the appellant insists that the court below should have dismissed this case for the reason that the facts alleged in the complaint do not constitute the crime of perjury as defined and punished by Act No. 1697, basing his contention on the ground that in order to sustain a conviction under said Act it was necessary to show that the appellant had testified twice about a certain matter, his latter testimony being contradictory of his former, and as he had only testified once he should have been charged with the crime of false swearing (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">falso testimonio<\/span>), under the provisions of Chapter VI of the Penal Code.<br\/>\u00a0<br\/>Section 3 of Act No. 1697 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any person who, having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the Philippine Islands authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury, and shall be punished by a fine of not more than two thousand pesos and by imprisonment for not more than five years; and shall, moreover, thereafter be incapable of holding any public office or of giving testimony in any court of the Philippine Islands until such time as the judgment against him is reversed.\"<\/blockquote>This section specifically provides that any person who has taken an oath before a competent tribunal that he will testify truly, or that any written testimony by him subscribed is true, willfully and contrary to such oath, states or subscribes to any material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury. This section does not impliedly require as an essential element of the crime of perjury that a defendant who is prosecuted for having violated these provisions should have testified twice in any case or in any investigation, his second testimony being contradictory of his first, but he can be charged and convicted of the crime of perjury if he willfully testifies, under oath, as provided in said section, to any material matter which he does not believe to be true.<br\/><br\/>In the case of The United States <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Concepcion (13 Phil. Rep., 424), the defendants were inspectors of the election board in the municipality of Calibo, Province of Capiz, in the election for Delegates held on the 31st of July, 1907. The defendants were accused and convicted for having violated the provisions of the Election Law, in that they refused to inscribe the name of one Esteban Leocario without just cause.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The point in controversy in said case was whether or not Esteban Leocario appeared before the inspectors (the accused) in order to have his name registered in the electoral list. The accused were convicted of having violated the provisions of the Election Law and on appeal to this court the sentence and judgment of the lower court was affirmed. The defendants having testified in that case that the said Esteban Leocario did not appear before them on the day alleged, to have his name registered as an elector, the prosecution filed a complaint against the said defendants charging them with the crime of perjury. The fact in controversy in both cases was only one, namely, the appearance or nonappearance of Esteban Leocario before the election inspector. The defendants having been convicted of the crime of perjury, they appealed, and this court, in passing upon the questions involved, said (pp. 425, 429) :<br\/><blockquote>\"The important question in the case, however, is whether this offense is to be punished by the provisions of the Penal Code, articles 318 and following, or whether these articles have been impliedly repealed by section 3 of Act No. 1697. If the case falls within the provisions of the Penal Code and those provisions are still in force, the judgment must be reversed, because this case for perjury was tried and decided in the court below before the termination of the case in which the false testimony was given.<br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br\/><\/div><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * \u00a0<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"Our conclusion is that the articles of the Penal Code relating to perjury have been repealed, and that the crime is now defined and punished by section 3 of Act No. 1697.\"<\/blockquote>So the reason given by counsel for the appellant as to the sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint is untenable, but there is a good reason why the complaint is insufficient in law, and that is that there is no allegation in this complaint that the testimony of the appellant in criminal case No. 1055 was material to the issues involved in\u00a0 said\u00a0 case.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 question\u00a0 apparently\u00a0 escaped the\u00a0 attention of the trial court, the prosecuting officers, and counsel for the appellant. It is not mentioned anywhere in the record, nor in the briefs filed in this court.<br\/><br\/>As we have said, the appellant willfully and contrary to the oath which he had taken, testified in said criminal case No. 1055 that Tambolero came to his house about 7 p. m. on May 15 and remained there until 5 a. m. of the next day. This testimony was false, but the record does not disclose (aside from the statement of counsel before mentioned) whether or not this false testimony did affect, or could have in any way affected, the questions involved in said murder case.<br\/><br\/>It is now necessary to determine whether or not the appellant is guilty of the crime of perjury under section 3 of Act No. 1697, above quoted (the provisions of the Penal Code with reference to false testimony having been repealed by Act No. 1697), when it is not alleged in the complaint, nor does it appear from the record, that the false testimony given by the appellant in said criminal case No. 1055 was material to the issues involved therein.<br\/><br\/>In the absence of a statute to the contrary, it is well settled that an indictment for perjury must show conclusively that the testimony given or assertion made by the defendant and charged to be false was material to the issue on the trial on which he was sworn or it will be fatally defective. This may be done either by a direct allegation that it was material, or by the allegation of facts from which 'its materiality will appear. (30 Cyc 1433, and U.

(Serra <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Mortiga, 204 U. S., 470, reported in 11 Phil. Rep., 762.)<br\/><br\/>The complaint in the case at bar is fatally defective for the want of an allegation that the testimony, alleged to be false, was material to the issues involved in the murder case. Our statute (section 3 of Act No. 1697, supra) specifically makes materiality an essential element of the crime of perjury and without this the crime can not legally exist. As no objection to the sufficiency of the complaint was raised this fatal defect could have been supplied by competent testimony on the trial.<br\/><br\/>The materiality of a matter sworn to must be established by evidence and can not be left to the presumption or inference. (30 Cyc, 1443, and Nelson <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. State, 32 Ark., 192; Mackin <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.

(In re Franklin County, 5 Ohio S. &amp; C. Pi. Dec, 691; 7 Ohio, N. P., 450; People <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Greenwell, 5 Utah, 112, 13 Pac, 89.)<br\/><br\/>By the common law perjury is the willful and corrupt taking of a false oath, lawfully administered in a judicial proceeding or the course of justice in regard to a matter material to the issue or point of inquiry. (30 Cyc, 1399, and cases cited therein.)<br\/><br\/>This definition of perjury, as modified by statute, may be more accurately defined to be the willful and corrupt assertion of a falsehood, under oath or affirmation administered by authority of law, in a material matter, the offense being enlarged and made to extend to other false oaths than those taken in the course of judicial proceedings. (30 Cyc, 1400, and cases cited.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of The State <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Hattaway (10 Am. Dec, 580) one Shackleford having been indicted for stealing a cow and afterwards discharged, brought an action against the prosecutor for malicious prosecution. In this action Hattaway was called as a witness and testified that Shackle-ford purchased the cow in question from one Carter, and that he was present at the time. Being asked where he lived at the time, he said, \"Near Carter's; perhaps within 100 yards;\" whereas it was proved that he did not live in the State. The perjury assigned was his false testimony as to where he lived. The trial court instructed the jury that the testimony was not material so as to constitute perjury, but the jury thought otherwise and found the defendant guilty. The defendant then moved to set aside the verdict as contrary to the law, and the court in passing upon this motion said (p. 581) :<br\/><blockquote>\"It seems to be agreed by all the writers on criminal law, that one ingredient in the crime of perjury is that the oath relate to some matter material to the question in issue: * * * There can be no doubt but that an extra-judicial oath, or one relating to a matter utterly immaterial, or even an impious oath, taken in idle conversation, may be as offensive in the eye of heaven as the most solemn oath taken in a court of justice. But there are many offenses against morality and religion which are not cognizable in courts of justice. For such offense, a man is answerable only to his God, and not to the laws of his country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"There is no offense the general character of which is better understood than that of perjury; and no point better settled, perhaps, than that the oath must relate to some fact material to the issue.\"<\/blockquote>There is a distinction between perjury and false swearing; the one is stubborn and corrupt while the other is simply not true, lacking the elements which go to constitute the crime of perjury.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Miller <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. State, 15 Fla., 577.)<br\/><br\/>Section 3 of Act No. 1697 is a copy, with the necessary changes only, of section 5392 of the Revised Statutes of the United States.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This section\u00a0\u00a0 (5392)\u00a0\u00a0 is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every person who, having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury, and shall be punished by a fine of not more than two thousand dollars, and by imprisonment, at hard labor, not more than five years; and shall, moreover, thereafter be incapable of giving testimony in any court of the United States until such time as the judgment against him is reversed.\"<\/blockquote>The essential parts of this section (5392) and section 3 of Act No. 1697 are exactly the same. It is also true that section 3 of our perjury law is practically the same as that of nearly all of the States of the Union wherein materiality is made, by statute, an element of the crime.<br\/><br\/>An essential element of the offense created by the statute (section 5392, Rev. Stat.) is the materiality of the matter charged to have been falsely stated. (U. S. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Landsberg, 23 Fed. Rep., 585.)<br\/><br\/>In some jurisdictions the prosecution of perjury is continued until the proceeding in which the perjury is alleged to have been committed has been ended, but under our law (Act No. 1697) it is not necessary that the proceeding in which the perjury was committed should be terminated before prosecution for that crime is commenced. (U. S. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.\u00a0 Concepcion, supra.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The contrary rule obtained for prosecutions under the .provisions of the Penal Code. (U.

Rep., 296.)<br\/><br\/>Where materiality is made by statute, as in Act No. 1697, an essential element of the crime of perjury, the doctrine of the courts that it,must be shown by competent proof that the false testimony was material to the issues involved, is settled beyond question. This doctrine pervades the entire adjudged law on the subject. \"Wherever we move in this department of our jurisprudence we come in contact with it. We can no more escape from it than from the atmosphere which surrounds us.\"<br\/><br\/>Aside from the statement of counsel in his brief, here-tofore referred to, the prosecution has failed to establish the legal guilt of the accused of the crime of perjury, inasmuch as it has not been proven in any manner that the false testimony of the appellant was material in the murder case.<br\/><br\/>We shall now determine in what way, if any, the said statement of counsel can affect the guilt of the accused. As we have said, he has not committed a crime (if this statement of counsel does not affect the result) for which he can be punished under the law in force in this jurisdiction. In order to sustain a conviction based on a fatally defective complaint, the defects must be supplied by competent proof. Counsel in his printed brief in this court states that the witness Tambolero testified in said murder case that when the murder was committed he saw one of the defendants come out of the lower part of the convent with a bolo in his hand. This is not a confession, as there is a marked difference between a confession and such a statement, but this is purely a statement by counsel made in the appellate court. It is more than probable that the appellant himself knows nothing of this statement; no doubt he has never seen the brief filed in this case. So such a statement made for the first time on appeal is not competent proof to establish the guilt of the appellant when such guilt must depend solely upon the said statement. Counsel for appellant was not authorized by his client to make this statement.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Sweet Clayton <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. State (4 Tex. App., 515), George Spears and Sweet Clayton were indicted in the district court of Uvalde, Texas, for the crime of conveying, or causing to be conveyed, into the jail of Uvalde County, certain instruments for the purpose of aiding two prisoners to make their escape. A motion for the arrest of the judgment was made in the court of appeals, based on the ground of the insufficiency of the indictment. The court did not sustain the contention of counsel for the defendants, but on its own motion reversed the judgment on another ground which was not raised by counsel and which referred to the admission made by defendant's counsel, and in passing upon this question the court, speaking through Mr. Justice White, said (p. 518) :<br\/><blockquote>\"The charge of the court, which was otherwise unexceptionable, presents an error which will necessitate a reversal of the case. In the fourth subdivision of the charge the jury are told that 'it is admitted by the defendant's counsel that John Woods and Lark Clayton were prisoners, legally confined in the county jail of Uvalde County, on an accusation of felony, to wit, theft of a cow.' As was said in the case of Nels <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. The State: 'The prisoner's counsel had no authority to make any statement or admission to supply the place or have the force of evidence against him. No confession of theirs could bind or affect him. Their admissions could not in law prejudice or affect his rights; nor could they be in any wise jeopardized by the assumption of any grounds whatever upon which his defense may have been placed by his counsel. Whether those grounds were correct or incorrect, true or false, was wholly immaterial. That was not the question for the consideration of the jury, whose duty it was to decide the question of the guilt or innocence upon the law as given them\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0\u00a0 court,\u00a0\u00a0 and\u00a0 the\u00a0\u00a0 evidence\u00a0 as\u00a0 given\u00a0 by\u00a0 the witnesses, irrespective of any admissions by the prisoner's counsel, or any grounds upon which they may have rested his defense.' \"<\/blockquote>In this case, defendant's counsel no doubt admitted in open court, at the time the defendants were on trial and in their presence, that the said Woods and Clayton were prisoners legally confined. It does not appear that the defendants made any objections to the said admission. Notwithstanding all these facts the court reversed the judgment solely for this reason.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar we do not find it necessary to go as far as the Texas court did, for the reason that the statement of counsel for the appellant was not made in the trial court and this record fails to disclose whether said statement was made in the presence of the accused; but it does conclusively show that the same was made for the first time in the printed brief on appeal. So such a statement can not be accepted as competent proof to supply the fatal defects in the complaint and form the basis upon which a conviction can be entered.<br\/><br\/>Our conclusions are, therefore, that the appellant is not guilty of the crime of perjury for the reasons above set forth. The judgment is reversed and the appellant acquitted, with costs <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de oflcio.<\/span><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

From this sentence and judgment they appealed.<br\/><br\/>The Government presented only one witness, Burgess, an internal-revenue agent, who testified that he, in company with a Mr. Hoye, another internal-revenue agent, having received information that the appellants had opium in their possession, obtained a search warrant from the justice of the peace of Lucena, Province of Tayabas, and proceeded on the 6th day of July, 1909, to search the house of the said appellants; that, when this search was made, both of the appellants were in the house during the entire time; that on entering the house Mr. Hoye searched the bedroom and he, the witness, guarded the kitchen to prevent the appellants from disposing of the opium should they desire to do so; that while the search was being conducted the appellant, Ambrosia de Jesus, passed through the kitchen and stopped on the <i>azotea,<\/i> being followed by him, the witness; that while they were standing on the <i>azotea<\/i> the other internal-revenue agent appeared there with the other appellant, Enrique Lopez Sy Quingco; that while the four were standing there together the Chinaman said to his wife, \"Ambrosia, turn over that package.\" Ambrosia, upon receiving this command from her husband, took from under her <i>saya<\/i> a small package of opium pills and gave it to Hoye; that when the Chinaman was asked certain questions he admitted that on the 7th of June of the same year two other Chinamen were in his house smoking opium. The witness further testified that these pills were sent to Manila and analyzed by the Bureau of Science and found to contain opium. This is the material part of the testimony of Burgess and the only testimony presented by the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>The two appellants testifying in their own behalf, while admitting that their house was searched on the 6th of July, 1909, by Burgess and Hoye, internal-revenue agents, positively deny any knowledge of the opium pills, stating that these two internal-revenue agents found nothing whatever in their house and that the package referred to was not turned over to Hoye by the appellant Ambrosia de Jesus.<br\/><br\/>Two municipal policemen, who accompanied the two internal-revenue agents at the time this search was made, were called as witnesses for the defense. One of these policemen, Tiburcio Abril by name, testified that he and the other policeman remained downstairs during the search, and that he did not see any package or any other thing found by the two Americans. The other policeman only stated that he remained below while the search was being conducted.<br\/><br\/>While it is true that the testimony of one witness is sufficient to sustain a conviction, if such testimony establishes the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, we think that the testimony of the one witness in this case is not sufficient for this purpose.<br\/><br\/>The other internal-revenue agent was not called as a witness, and the only testimony which connects this Chinaman with the offense is that of the witness Burgess, wherein he stated that the Chinaman ordered his wife to turn over the package to Hoye. This is specifically denied by the Chinaman and his wife. The two policemen, if they heard anything about opium being found at that time, failed to, state it in their testimony.<br\/><br\/>This search was made on the 6th of July, 1909, under a search warrant issued by the justice of the peace. The complaint was not filed until the 22d of September of the same year. The internal-revenue agents did not return the search warrant at the time search was made, but delayed over two months. While the witness Burgess attempts to explain this delay by stating that he sent the pills to the Bureau of Science for analysis, we think his explanation is not sufficient to justify this long delay.<br\/><br\/>The appellants have the presumption of innocence in their favor until the contrary is proven. The positive testimony of the two appellants is sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to their guilt. This doubt must be resolved in favor of the appellants.<br\/><br\/>The judgment is, therefore, reversed, and the appellants, Enrique Lopez Sy Quingco and Ambrosia de Jesus, are acquitted, with costs de oftcio.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that on the 17th day of September, 1908, there were\u00a0 present in that house Felix\u00a0 Mendoza, the witness,\u00a0 and one Pascual\u00a0 Ismael; that very\u00a0 early in the morning of said\u00a0 day four individuals, namely,\u00a0 Ponciano Salazar,\u00a0 Venancio Villanueva,\u00a0 Antonino Evaristo,\u00a0 and Eugenio\u00a0 Seriosa,\u00a0 came to the house; that Villanueva, Evaristo, and Seriosa were armed with revolvers and Salazar was armed\u00a0 with a Remington\u00a0 rifle;\u00a0 that said\u00a0 four,\u00a0 on arriving\u00a0 at the house, arrested\u00a0 Felix\u00a0 Mendoza; that they bound\u00a0 him to\u00a0 Pascual Ismael;\u00a0 that,\u00a0 after having bound them, the four individuals discharged\u00a0 several shots at the house,\u00a0 then\u00a0 entered the same and searched\u00a0\u00a0 it carefully; that,\u00a0 after completing their\u00a0 search,\u00a0 they destroyed\u00a0 the house; that they then left the house, taking with\u00a0 them the witness, Mendoza, and Ismael, conducting them to the house of Toribio Ramos, where\u00a0 they\u00a0 ate their breakfast; that during the breakfast Mendoza was tied to a table leg; that in the afternoon\u00a0 they left the house\u00a0 and soon thereafter released\u00a0 Ismael;\u00a0 that\u00a0 they proceeded\u00a0 in the\u00a0 direction of Rabago and arrived there\u00a0 late in the afternoon; that there they ate their supper; that they then proceeded to a point just outside of the pueblo of Rosales and stopped again; that they were so near some of the inhabited houses of the pueblo that the people occupying the\u00a0 houses\u00a0 could\u00a0 hear the ordinary conversation of the defendants and their companions; that, after\u00a0 it became dark, they\u00a0 built\u00a0 a large bonfire in the\u00a0 road, from the light of\u00a0 which everything for some distance around became plainly visible;\u00a0 that, after having made the fire, Salazar said to\u00a0 Mendoza, \"Commend your soul to God, because now we are going to kill you;\" that thereupon Mendoza got down\u00a0 upon his knees in the middle of the road and in the light of\u00a0 the bonfire and Salazar shot him\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 back with the Remington rifle; that Mendoza, on receiving the shot, said \"Pardon me and have pity on my family;\" that his captors paid no attention to his words, but, on the contrary, both of the\u00a0 defendants, together with\u00a0 Evaristo and\u00a0 Seriosa,\u00a0 shot\u00a0 him repeatedly in the back with\u00a0 their revolvers; that they shot him at a distance\u00a0 of from\u00a0 6 to 8\u00a0 meters;\u00a0 that while\u00a0 they\u00a0 were shooting him,\u00a0 they began to cry \"<i>guerilla, guerilla;<\/i>\" that after they had shot him, Salazar went to where witness was kneeling and\u00a0 said to her, \"Go over yonder where he is arid beg his pardon;\" that she thereupon\u00a0 approached Mendoza, who was\u00a0 still able to speak and who\u00a0 said to her \"my poor family\" and immediately expired; that thereupon the defendants went to the justice of the peace to give an account of what had happened, agreeing\u00a0 that\u00a0 they would say\u00a0 to the justice\u00a0 that they\u00a0 had been attacked by malefactors, and that deceased, in attempting\u00a0 to\u00a0 escape in the confusion, was killed; that the killing of Mendoza occurred between 7 and 8 o'clock of the night; that, while the night was dark, she was able to see perfectly all\u00a0 that transpired, not only because it occurred in the middle of the street and her view was therefore unobstructed,\u00a0 but also by reason of the bonfire which they had made; that when\u00a0 Mendoza was shot his elbows were bound together and there was a rope around his neck.<br\/><br\/>Said\u00a0 Veronica\u00a0 Valenzuela is the\u00a0 only\u00a0 witness\u00a0 for the prosecution who claims to have seen the event.\u00a0 The witness Ismael corroborated, to some extent,\u00a0 the testimony of the witness Valenzuela up to the time when he was set at liberty, but fails wholly to\u00a0 corroborate her in the most important portion of her testimony.\u00a0 He\u00a0 does\u00a0 not testify that the deceased was bound elbow to\u00a0 elbow as stated\u00a0 by her. Neither\u00a0 does the witness Praxedes Doliente,\u00a0 wife of the deceased.\u00a0 Upon that point Veronica is wholly without corroboration.<br\/><br\/>The witness\u00a0 Dizon,\u00a0 the fourth and last\u00a0 witness of the prosecution, testified that he, at the time of the commission of the alleged crimes, was the sanitary\u00a0 inspector of that district; that he was not\u00a0 a physician or surgeon; that he examined the body of Felix Mendoza two\u00a0 or three\u00a0 days after his death; that he found\u00a0 six gunshot wounds in the body, five of which were\u00a0 mortal; that two of the wounds were\u00a0 made by\u00a0 a Remington rifle\u00a0 and the other four by revolvers; that he knew said two wounds were caused by a Remington rifle because those wounds were much larger in size than the other four wounds; that some of the wounds were inflicted from\u00a0 the rear; that the\u00a0 reason why he knew that such wounds were inflicted from the rear was that the wounds in\u00a0 front\u00a0 were larger than\u00a0 those in the back, he alleging that the bullet in\u00a0 its exit makes a larger aperture than at its entrance; that he had no\u00a0 knowledge whatever of his own upon that subject and had never tried, or seen tried, any experiments from the results of which he could draw\u00a0 such\u00a0 an inference; that\u00a0 some of said wounds must have been made while deceased was on his\u00a0 knees\u00a0 because the\u00a0 track of the bullets took a downward slant,\u00a0 their exit being lower upon the body than their entrance.<br\/><br\/>These are the only witnesses produced by the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>The defendants testified in their own behalf.\u00a0 The facts, as they and the three witnesses, Evaristo, Seriosa, and Severo, who were of the party having\u00a0 deceased in custody, relate them, are as follows:<br\/><br\/>Some time prior\u00a0 to the event from which this action springs\u00a0 it was known to the Constabulary officers of that locality that the deceased was in possession of prohibited arms\u00a0 and that\u00a0 he\u00a0 was a\u00a0 desperate character and\u00a0 was strongly suspected of complicity in various robberies and other crimes.\u00a0 For the purpose of obtaining such arms the captain of the Constabulary of that district\u00a0 ordered the defendant Villanueva, who was a member of the Constabulary, to arrest the deceased and search his premises.\u00a0 In order to carry out this order the defendant Villanueva took with him the defendant\u00a0 Salazar, a municipal policeman of Rosales, Pangasinan,\u00a0 Eugenio Seriosa, another member of the Constabulary, and Antonio Evaristo,\u00a0 a member of the secret police of Rosales. These four were later joined by Eulalio Severo, a rural\u00a0 policeman.\u00a0 They went to the house of the deceased, arrested him\u00a0 upon a warrant\u00a0 previously\u00a0 procured\u00a0 for the\u00a0 purpose,\u00a0 searched\u00a0 the\u00a0 premises and\u00a0 discovered a Remington rifle\u00a0 and a quantity of cartridges belonging to the same.\u00a0 Thereupon they started to take him before the justice of the peace who had issued the warrant. Between 7 and 8 o'clock of the night in question they arrived at a place near the\u00a0 pueblo of Rosales\u00a0 and within earshot of many of the houses belonging to that pueblo.\u00a0 On arriving at said place they were beset by a band of persons unknown, and were ordered to halt and to disclose who they were.\u00a0 On answering that\u00a0 they were municipal policemen and members of the Constabulary they heard\u00a0 the words from the band of unknown, \"<i>avance en guerrilla<\/i>,\" followed instantly by the discharge of several shots\u00a0 from firearms. Thereupon they\u00a0 in turn discharged\u00a0 several shots\u00a0 at\u00a0 the unknown\u00a0 persons.\u00a0 At that moment, and during the confusion ensuing, the deceased, Mendoza, leaped forward\u00a0 and grasped the revolver which the defendant Salazar\u00a0 had in his hand and sought to wrest it from him.\u00a0\u00a0 Salazar, seeing that the deceased would succeed in his design, called upon the defendant Villanueva to aid him.\u00a0\u00a0 Villanueva, on reaching the side of Salazar, observed that Mendoza had hold of the revolver\u00a0 and was endeavoring with all his might to secure\u00a0 complete\u00a0 possession\u00a0 of it.\u00a0 Villanueva\u00a0 thereupon sought to aid his companion and both he and. Salazar attempted\u00a0 to break the hold which the deceased had upon it. Finding\u00a0 that they could not do\u00a0 so, the defendant Villanueva said to the deceased \"let loose of the revolver for your own safety.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Mendoza did not reply, but redoubled his\u00a0 efforts to obtain possession of it.\u00a0\u00a0 Villanueva, seeing that\u00a0 it was likely that the deceased, on account of his unusual physical strength, would succeed\u00a0 in obtaining possession of the revolver unless heroic measures\u00a0 were immediately adopted, in order to prevent that result, discharged his revolver at deceased.\u00a0 Instead of letting go of the revolver and ceasing his efforts to obtain possession\u00a0 of it,\u00a0 the deceased continued to hold fast to it and attacked\u00a0 the two more savagely than before.\u00a0\u00a0 Thereupon Villanueva again fired his revolver at the deceased.\u00a0 It seems that at this point deceased let go the revolver\u00a0 but did not cease his attack on them, but rather continued to attack them both, advancing against them fiercely. They both then fired at him for the purpose of repelling his assault and continued\u00a0 to discharge their revolvers at him until he fell to the ground.\u00a0 The defense further\u00a0 says that the\u00a0 deceased did not cease to attack them until he had been shot several times; that they did not shopt him after he ceased to attack them;\u00a0 that they shot\u00a0 him because he, being much larger and stronger than they, was likely to obtain possession of the revolver, in which event they knew he would do\u00a0 all he could to kill them both; that no shots whatever were fired from\u00a0 the\u00a0 Remington rifle;\u00a0 that\u00a0 said Remington rifle was not in possession of Salazar, as alleged by Veronica, at any time, but was at all times in the possession of Seriosa, who, with\u00a0 Evaristo\u00a0 and the witness Veronica and\u00a0 the rural policeman, Severo, was far behind Salazar and Villanueva at the time\u00a0 that the deceased was shot; that the\u00a0 night was dark and\u00a0 that\u00a0 it was impossible\u00a0 for Seriosa or his companions in the rear of Veronica, who\u00a0 was with them, to see what was transpiring;\u00a0 that the'defendants at no time bound the\u00a0 deceased elbow to elbow; that he had a rqpe around his\u00a0 right arm only, the other end being held by Salazar so that the deceased could not escape in the darkness; that they made no bonfire\u00a0 prior to the death of Mendoza; that a bonfire was made\u00a0 prior to the arrival of the justice of the peace by those who were guarding the corpse.<br\/><br\/>As before stated, Veronica Valenzuela is the only witness for the prosecution who claims to have witnessed the death of Mendoza, and she is, therefore, the only witness who contradicts\u00a0 the story of the defendants and their witnesses. After a careful examination of the evidence we do not believe her testimony should be given any weight whatever, and for the following reasons:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>She says that the deceased was bound elbow to elbow from the time he was arrested until the\u00a0 time of his death, and that he also had a rope around his neck which was held so tight by his captors that he was unable to stoop forward. This testimony is not corroborated by any witness.\u00a0 On the contrary, it is denied in every part by the\u00a0 defendants, by Seriosa,\u00a0 Severo, and\u00a0 Evaristo, and also by the witnesses Ramos,\u00a0 Nacion, Espejo, Bermejo, and Organista, who saw the party at various points of the way as they traveled\u00a0 from the place where deceased was arrested to the place where he was\u00a0 killed.\u00a0 They all testified, that at no time\u00a0 and at\u00a0 no place was the deceased bound\u00a0 elbow to elbow, nor did he have a rope around his neck.\u00a0 All concur in\u00a0 stating that he had a rope tied around his right arm only and that the end of the rope was held by one of his captors.\u00a0\u00a0 It appears from the testimony of the justice of the peace and those who accompanied\u00a0 him when he went to view the remains that the deceased had\u00a0 a\u00a0 rope around his right arm only.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>She also testifies that the party was not attacked\u00a0 by a band of\u00a0 malefactors, as described by the defendants, but that\u00a0 the defendants agreed among themselves\u00a0 that\u00a0 they would make it appear that they had been so attacked in order to excuse the commission of the\u00a0 crime.\u00a0 This testimony is opposed by the declarations of the defendants and by that\u00a0 of Seriosa,\u00a0 Severo, and Evaristo, and also by the testimony of Organista, who was an\u00a0 inhabitant of\u00a0 the pueblo of Rosales and who\u00a0 heard the shots of the band of malefactors, followed by the shots of the\u00a0 Constabulary in return; also by the testimony of the witness Sevilla, who was also a resident of that\u00a0 pueblo and who heard not only the\u00a0 shots of the band of malefactors but also the words \"<i>avance en guerrilla\"\u00a0 <\/i>The witness Canonizado, the justice of the peace referred to, testified that when he arrived at the scene of the event the witness Veronica said to him that she\u00a0 was very glad that\u00a0 he\u00a0 had come because she had\u00a0 not yet\u00a0 lost the fear under which she\u00a0 had\u00a0 labored\u00a0 because of their having been attacked by the band of\u00a0 malefactors, and because of the shots which they had fired.\u00a0 He says that she\u00a0 further stated to him directly and positively that they had\u00a0 been attacked by a band of malefactors.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>She also testified that four persons, the two defendants and\u00a0 Seriosa and Evaristo, all shot the deceased.\u00a0 She says that\u00a0 Salazar\u00a0 shot him\u00a0 with\u00a0 the\u00a0 Remington\u00a0 rifle,\u00a0 while the\u00a0 other three shot him\u00a0 with their revolvers.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 and the witnesses Seriosa and Evaristo\u00a0 all testified that the two revolvers carried\u00a0 by Evaristo and Seriosa were broken and\u00a0 wholly useless and could not be cocked or discharged.\u00a0 The\u00a0 witness\u00a0 John J. Gallant,\u00a0 captain of Constabulary, testified that the\u00a0 said two\u00a0 revolvers\u00a0 were those which he served out to Seriosa and Evaristo and that they were broken and utterly useless and could not be cocked or discharged.\u00a0 To the\u00a0 same\u00a0 effect is\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony of Lieutenant\u00a0 Branson\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Constabulary.\u00a0 The two\u00a0 revolvers were introduced in evidence and are found to\u00a0 be in the condition\u00a0 described by the defendants and\u00a0 their witnesses.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>She also testified that prior\u00a0 to the\u00a0 time when he was arrested\u00a0 she had\u00a0 never\u00a0 seen\u00a0 a gun or other firearm in Mendoza's house and that she did not know of his\u00a0 having any\u00a0 firearms whatever,\u00a0 and that the Remington rifle in question was brought to Mendoza's house by the defendants themselves.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 testimony is flatly contradicted by\u00a0 Captain\u00a0 Gallant, who\u00a0 says that neither the\u00a0 Constabulary nor the police were permitted to carry Remington rifles or other rifles and that no rifles of any description were served out to them.\u00a0\u00a0 Lieutenant Branson also testified to\u00a0 the same effect.\u00a0 All of the defendants and all of the other persons present at the\u00a0 death\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased testified that none of the party had a Remington rifle until one was found in the house of Mendoza.\u00a0 In further contradiction of the testimony of the witness Veronica upon this point, the justice of the peace before referred to testified that she came before him some\u00a0 time prior to the arrest of Mendoza\u00a0 and gave information that Mendoza had in his house a Remington rifle and a revolver and that she asked that they\u00a0 be\u00a0 taken away from\u00a0 him\u00a0 because she was afraid that\u00a0 he\u00a0 might\u00a0 do\u00a0 her harm with them.\u00a0 The witness Evaristo testified that the witness Veronica came to\u00a0 him as a member of the Constabulary some time prior to the death of deceased and told him that Mendoza had prohibited\u00a0 arms,\u00a0 and asked him to take measures to remove them from his house.<br\/><\/li><\/ol>It is claimed, however, that the testimony\u00a0 of\u00a0 the witness Veronica is corroborated by the declaration\u00a0 of\u00a0 the witness Dizon.\u00a0 It will be remembered that Dizon was the sanitary inspector of the district in\u00a0 which\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased was killed and that he, although not a physician or surgeon, testified as an expert witness,\u00a0 describing\u00a0 as fully as he could\u00a0 the wounds which\u00a0 were\u00a0 found upon the body of the deceased after\u00a0 his death.\u00a0 Such corroboration is claimed in the following particulars:<br\/><ol type=\"1\"><li>Her testimony as to\u00a0 the firing of the Remington rifle by Salazar is corroborated by the\u00a0 witness Dizon, who testified\u00a0 that two of the six wounds upon the body were larger than the other four, proving,\u00a0 as he swore, that these two wounds were\u00a0 caused by bullets from\u00a0 the rifle, while\u00a0 the other\u00a0 four were caused by bullets from the revolvers.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>Her testimony\u00a0 in relation to the claim that the\u00a0 deceased was shot from behind is corroborated\u00a0 by the testimony of the witness Dizon, who testified that, in his judgment, some of the wounds were made from behind because the wounds upon the front\u00a0 of the body\u00a0 were larger than those upon the rear, proving that he had been shot from behind because, as claimed by the witness\u00a0 Dizon, the exit wounds made by gunshots\u00a0 are\u00a0 larger than\u00a0 the\u00a0 entrance wounds.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>Her testimony in which she asserts that the deceased was\u00a0 shot while on his knees is\u00a0 corroborated by the testimony of the witness Dizon, who said that the track of some of the wounds slanted downward in the body of the deceased, the exit wound being lower than the entrance wound.<\/li><\/ol>As to the claim of the witness Dizon that two\u00a0 of the wounds were made by the Remington rifle, which claim is based upon the alleged fact that two of the\u00a0 wounds were larger than\u00a0 the other four,\u00a0 it must\u00a0 be noted, in the first place, that it is nowhere claimed by the prosecution, unless the testimony\u00a0 of this witness is\u00a0 such claim, that two shots were fired from the Remington rifle.\u00a0 In fact, the testimony of Veronica herself is to the effect that <i>only\u00a0 one shot<\/i> was fired with the Remington rifle.\u00a0 She testified to that fact positively and without equivocation.\u00a0 There\u00a0 is no other testimony in the case whatever\u00a0 in relation to the number of times that the Remington rifle was fired.\u00a0\u00a0 It is evidence, therefore, that the witness Dizon or the witness Veronica was\u00a0 mistaken\u00a0 as to one of the alleged gunshot wounds at least.\u00a0 In the\u00a0 second place, it must be remembered\u00a0 that it is the undisputed evidence of the case that the caliber of the revolvers used on that occasion was considerably larger than the caliber of the Remington rifle.\u00a0 It is the\u00a0 uncontradicted evidence that the caliber of the Remington rifle was\u00a0 .443, while that of the revolvers was .45, and that the ball\u00a0 carried by the revolvers was considerably larger and heavier than that carried by the rifle.\u00a0 It is but natural to assume, therefore, in the absence of reliable evidence to the contrary, that the orifice made by the revolver ball would be appreciably\u00a0 larger than the orifice made by the rifle ball. That such would\u00a0 be\u00a0 the case with inanimate objects at least was conclusively\u00a0 demonstrated by the\u00a0 experiments performed during the trial of the action,\u00a0 in which shots were fired from the revolvers and from the rifle through paper targets and a thick board.\u00a0 In every case the orifice or hole made in the paper and\u00a0 in the board by the balls fired from the revolvers was appreciably larger than those made by the balls\u00a0 from the rifle.\u00a0 Moreover, Captain Gallant testified as an expert\u00a0 in the use of firearms and declared\u00a0 that\u00a0 a\u00a0 ball from the\u00a0 Remington rifle in question, discharged at short range,\u00a0 would not cause in\u00a0 the human body as large an orifice, either\u00a0 of entrance or of exit, as it would if discharged at long range, and that there would be,\u00a0 at the range at which it was claimed that the deceased was shot, an appreciable difference between the size of the wounds caused by the Remington rifle\u00a0 and the revolvers, those made by the\u00a0 revolvers being larger than those caused by the rifle.\u00a0 He also said that fired at\u00a0 such a range there would\u00a0 be no appreciable difference in\u00a0 size between\u00a0 the entrance and exit\u00a0 wounds made by the rifle bullet, unless the bullet struck a bone.\u00a0 It is probable,\u00a0 therefore, from such evidence as is at\u00a0 hand, that the witness Dizon\u00a0 was entirely wrong in\u00a0 his conclusion that, because\u00a0 two of the wounds were in his opinion\u00a0 larger than the others, those two must have been made by the Remington rifle.\u00a0 Besides, the witness Vallejo, who testified for the defense and who, as we gain from his testimony, had had as much experience with gunshot wounds as the\u00a0 witness Dizon, stated that he had carefully examined the gunshot wounds in the body of the deceased, and\u00a0 that\u00a0 those upon the front of deceased's body were all of equal size; that of the gunshot wounds upon the\u00a0 back of\u00a0 the deceased\u00a0 all were of the same size, except one,\u00a0 which\u00a0 was considerably larger than the others; that this increased size of\u00a0 that wound was\u00a0 due to the\u00a0 fact that the ball had\u00a0 passed through the shoulder blade,\u00a0 and, having, therefore, met\u00a0 with\u00a0 greater resistance, had made a larger hole.\u00a0\u00a0 He testified, moreover, that, with the exception of the\u00a0 one wound referred\u00a0 to, there was no difference in\u00a0 the size\u00a0 of the wounds in the front as\u00a0 compared with those in the back.\u00a0\u00a0 He further stated that, in his judgment, all of the wounds were\u00a0 made from the\u00a0 front, basing that conclusion,\u00a0 as\u00a0 he testified, upon a minute examination\u00a0 of the wounds.<br\/><br\/>As to the claim that the track of some\u00a0 of the wounds was downward,\u00a0 no\u00a0 evidence has been given upon that point by the defense. The only evidence in the case is that given by the witness Dizon.\u00a0 No\u00a0 satisfactory explanation has been made of that feature of the case.\u00a0\u00a0 It does not seem\u00a0 that one can be\u00a0 made, except possibly on the theory that in the struggle which took place between\u00a0 the defendants and the deceased, and with the consequent turning and twisting\u00a0 of the bodies of the contestants, a bullet shot into the body\u00a0 of the deceased might possibly have taken any one of a variety of directions.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, it is impossible to determine from the course\u00a0 of the bullet\u00a0 wounds, as shown in this case,\u00a0 in what direction the weapons\u00a0 from which the\u00a0 bullets came were pointed.\u00a0 In passing through the human\u00a0 body a bullet meets so many things which may deflect it from its direct course\u00a0 that, unless the\u00a0 wound\u00a0 is carefully probed\u00a0 or an autopsy had, it is extremely dangerous to place too much confidence in general appearances.\u00a0\u00a0 While Dizon claims to have\u00a0 probed the wound\u00a0 in\u00a0 question, this was admittedly done two or three days after death, at which time, as\u00a0 is well known, probing a wound is most difficult and the results correspondingly uncertain.\u00a0 Taken\u00a0 in connection with all the circumstances, the direction of\u00a0 the\u00a0 bullet\u00a0 wounds, although\u00a0 extremely\u00a0 important if fully\u00a0 and\u00a0 satisfactorily proved, does not carry,\u00a0 we\u00a0 think, weight sufficient\u00a0 to influence\u00a0 materially the\u00a0 case against\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants, or to assist materially\u00a0 in rehabilitating the shattered testimony of the witness Veronica.<br\/><br\/>Upon the whole case as presented by\u00a0 the evidence, it is clear that the credibility of Veronica as\u00a0 a witness is completely destroyed\u00a0 and that the fair weight of the testimony is to the effect that the deceased met his death in the manner and for the\u00a0 reasons described by the defendants and not in the manner and for the\u00a0 reasons\u00a0 assigned by\u00a0 the\u00a0 witness Veronica.\u00a0 These conclusions were reached by\u00a0 the\u00a0 court below.\u00a0 In his decision he says;<br\/><blockquote>\"In the opinion of the court the\u00a0 defendants can not claim exemption from criminal responsibility; but the court appreciates\u00a0 in favor of both defendants two extenuating circumstances, that is to say, that of\u00a0 race and that of the fact that the fatal act was immediately preceded by provocation and\u00a0 threat, for the\u00a0 court is unable to conceive\u00a0 how\u00a0 both defendants should have attacked the deceased <i>if the latter had not provoked them really and truly attempting to obtain possession of the revolver of one of them.\"<\/i><br\/><\/blockquote>Although the court below recited during the course of his decision some\u00a0 of the circumstances which in his opinion, corroborated the testimony of Veronica, nevertheless, his final conclusion is based upon the fact that the death of the deceased resulted in the manner and for the reasons presented by the\u00a0 defendants; and\u00a0 while\u00a0 in the judgment of the court the facts and circumstances set out by the defendants were not sufficient to exempt them wholly from criminal responsibility, nevertheless,\u00a0 he found them to be true, and as true made them\u00a0 perform the\u00a0 office of an extenuating circumstance in order to reduce the penalty to be imposed upon the\u00a0 culprits.\u00a0 If he had found true the facts as set out by the witness Veronica, the\u00a0 court\u00a0 could not possibly have found the defendants\u00a0 guilty of any crime\u00a0 less than murder or have imposed any penalty less than death.\u00a0 Under her testimony the crime was qualified by premeditation and attended with the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity, <i>alevosia, <\/i>and abuse of superior force.<br\/><br\/>There is nothing which would even justify\u00a0 a suspicion that\u00a0 he was killed by some artful process of elimination, as if he were a dangerous character.\u00a0 The deceased in this case\u00a0 was\u00a0 killed almost within the pueblo of Rosales.\u00a0 At the time of his death he and his\u00a0 captors were so near to some of the inhabited houses of that pueblo that an ordinary conversation could be heard by the occupants of said houses. Veronica herself testified\u00a0 that during the loud talk which she alleged occurred between the members of the party, the occupants of some of said houses became\u00a0 frightened and ran away.\u00a0 Moreover, if the testimony of Veronica is to be believed, the defendants, with the assistance of other members\u00a0 of the party, prior to shooting the deceased, built a large bonfire in the middle of the\u00a0 road which lit up\u00a0 the locality with great clearness, and that it was in the middle of the\u00a0 highway and in the bright light\u00a0 of\u00a0 this bonfire, in full view of all members\u00a0 of the party and of any of\u00a0 the inhabitants of that\u00a0 portion of the\u00a0 pueblo\u00a0 who desired to turn\u00a0 that way, that the\u00a0 deceased\u00a0 was compelled to\u00a0 get down upon his knees and in that posture was shot to death. It seems incredible that men who contemplated the murder of\u00a0 a\u00a0 fellowman would be at\u00a0 so great pains to advertise their crime to all\u00a0 the world.\u00a0\u00a0 The chief feature attendant upon\u00a0 the murder of a captive by his captors was the secrecy with\u00a0 which the murder was committed and\u00a0 the isolation of the locality in which it occurred.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 question that\u00a0 remains\u00a0 for\u00a0 consideration then\u00a0 is whether or not the defendants were justified in killing the deceased under the law.<br\/><br\/>Article 8 of the\u00a0 Penal Code reads\u00a0 in part as follows: \"The following\u00a0 are\u00a0 not delinquent and\u00a0 are, therefore, exempt from criminal liability:<br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <blockquote>\"4.\u00a0 He who acts in defense of his\u00a0 person\u00a0 or rights, provided there are the following attendant circumstances:<br\/><br\/>\"(1)\u00a0 Illegal aggression.<br\/><br\/>\"(2)\u00a0 Reasonable necessity\u00a0 of the means employed\u00a0 to prevent or repel it.<br\/><br\/>\"(3)\u00a0 Lack of sufficient\u00a0 provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<br\/><br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"6.\u00a0 He who acts in defense of the person or rights of a stranger, provided\u00a0 the first and second circumstances mentioned in number 4 are attendant and that the defender is not actuated by revenge, resentment, or other illegal motive.<br\/><center><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"11.

They knew\u00a0 also that\u00a0 in a hand-to-hand struggle without weapons he was more than\u00a0 a\u00a0 match for both.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 apparent that\u00a0 if the measures resorted to\u00a0 by\u00a0 the defendants to keep possession of the revolver had not been taken,\u00a0 the deceased, by reason of his great physicial strength, would have gained control of the weapon.\u00a0\u00a0 This would have put the defendants\u00a0 in the very gravest peril.\u00a0 The situation at the time really resolved itself, to all intents and\u00a0 purposes, into the\u00a0 question whether it would be the deceased or\u00a0 the defendants who would be killed.\u00a0 While there were five men in the party, in addition to the deceased, the\u00a0 two defendants were substantially alone at the time, it appearing from the evidence that the remaining members of the party, together with the witness Veronica, were a considerable distance to the rear and were occupied in taking care of the carabaos which had become frightened at the discharge of the firearms.\u00a0 Under\u00a0 all the circumstances of the case,\u00a0 it may fairly be said that before assistance could come to the defendants from the other members of the party the deceased would have accomplished his purpose.<br\/><br\/>The defendants before shooting were not obliged to wait until the deceased had obtained complete possession or control of the weapon.\u00a0\u00a0 They were not required to do anything or refrain from doing anything which would increase their danger or enhance the opportunity of the aggressor to accomplish his end.\u00a0 (U.

Prompt action was essential.\u00a0 Under the influence of the furious\u00a0 attack\u00a0 and the\u00a0 excitement into which they were thrown\u00a0 by reason of\u00a0 it, they had no time to think; no time for deliberate, careful judgment or nice calculation; no opportunity to devise means or lay plans.\u00a0 Under such circumstances the law does not hold men to the standards of careful thought\u00a0 and calm judgment, either in calculating the imminency of the\u00a0 danger threatening them or in\u00a0 discriminating as to the means they should employ to avert it.

If the defendant in the case cited\u00a0 was entitled legally to be relieved from all criminal liability, upon what\u00a0 subtile distinction, and, above all, upon what principles of justice, shall we found a judgment\u00a0 declaring guilty the appellants at bar?<br\/><br\/>In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Patala (2 Phil. Rep., 752) the court says (p. 756):<br\/><blockquote>\"It appears from the testimony of the defendant that at the time of the occurrence\u00a0 he was cleaning fish on\u00a0 board the steamship <i> Compania\u00a0 de Filipinos;<\/i> that without any provocation on his part the deceased, who was\u00a0 the cook of the boat, believing that\u00a0 some of\u00a0 the fish, was missing, slapped him and\u00a0 kicked him; that not being satisfied with this, when the defendant started to run away from him the deceased\u00a0 pursued him and attacked him with a knife; that the defendant,\u00a0 taking advantage\u00a0 of some\u00a0 favorable chance during the struggle, succeeded in wresting the knife from the deceased and inflicted upon him a wound in the left side, from the result of which he died a few\u00a0 hours later\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"The aggression on the part of the deceased was in every respect unjustified, and\u00a0 the defendant had a perfect right to repel the attack in the most adequate\u00a0 form within his power <i>under the critical circumstances of a sudden assault.<\/i> *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 He had reason to believe that\u00a0 he was\u00a0 placed in the alternative of killing or being killed when he was being attacked and pursued with a deadly weapon.\u00a0\u00a0 This was the only\u00a0 weapon\u00a0 used\u00a0 during the struggle\u00a0 and it\u00a0 necessarily had to\u00a0 be either in his\u00a0 possession\u00a0 or in the hands\u00a0 of the deceased.\u00a0 If through a fortunate accident he came into possession of the knife,\u00a0 he could\u00a0 have lost control of it through a similar accident and then found himself at the mercy of his assailant.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore the act\u00a0 of the defendant rendering his assailant powerless as well as he could under the critical circumstances of the moment, and repelling his aggression,\u00a0 constitute, in our opinion, a true case of\u00a0 self-defense, which exempts\u00a0 the defendant from any\u00a0 criminal liability under paragraph 4 of article 8 of the Penal Code.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It will be noted that in this case substantially all danger to the defendant had\u00a0 passed when he secured possession of the knife.\u00a0\u00a0 His aggressor was\u00a0 unarmed.\u00a0 Yet\u00a0 <i>under\u00a0 the critical\u00a0 circumstances of a sudden assault <\/i>the killing by the defendant of an unarmed man was wholly excused. Under the \"critical circumstances of a sudden assault\" the\u00a0 defendants in the case at bar killed a man, a powerful desperado, who was\u00a0 doing his best to procure means to kill them.

The complaint further alleged that the defendants strictly prohibited the tenants of the said lands from giving any account of and share in the crops in the future to the plaintiffs, but ordered that they account to them, the defendants, with the warning that, should they fail to obey, they would cease to be the tenants and the lands would be taken away from them; that the defendants by this illegal action deprived the plaintiffs of the right that they had in the said lands and continue to hold the same up to date, on which account the plaintiffs suffered damages to the amount of P300; wherefore they asked that judgment be rendered against the defendants, compelling the latter to deliver to the plaintiffs the fruits illegally collected, or their equivalent in cash, P49.30, sentencing them forever to hold their peace, and to cease disturbing the plaintiffs in their peaceable possession, to pay an indemnity for loss and damage in the sum of P300, and the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>At the end of the complaint appears a statement of the properties, described and designated under the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z.<br\/><br\/>The defendants, Aurea Corrales and her husband Lazaro Alapriz, in answer to the complaint and after admitting paragraph 1 thereof, denied each and all the other facts alleged from the second to the last paragraph, inclusive, of the said complaint, and further set forth: That the lands in question belonged to the defendant, Aurea Corrales, as the transferee of the rights of her aunt, Patricia Fortuna, then deceased, who, during her lifetime, and for an uninterrupted period of about twenty years, was in peaceable possession of the said lands, and that the defendants, by the filing of this complaint, suffered loss and damage estimated at P350, and therefore asked that the court render judgment by absolving them from the complaint and sentencing the plaintiffs to the payment of the said amount as losses and damages, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>With the permission of the court, the defendants amended paragraph 3 of their answer above-mentioned and then changed the latter to read as follows: The defendant Corrales, assisted by her husband, alleges: That, with the exception of the lands designated by the letters 0, P, and T, which she does not know, and that designated by the letter N, which is virtually the same as that specified under the letter J, she possesses all the lands in question as the transferee of all the rights and obligations of her said aunt, Patricia Fortuna, now deceased, who during her lifetime was in quiet and peaceable possession of them for a period of eighteen years, until her death in 1908. That these lands belonged to Petrona Fortuna who, before her death eighteen years ago, provided in her will that they should all pass to the care of her sister Patricia, the predecessor in interest of the defendants, with the powers and duties therein imposed upon her. The defendants prayed the court to allow this amendment which constituted their defense.<br\/><br\/>The case came to trial, oral evidence was introduced by both sides, and the documents exhibited were attached to the record, after, exception had been taken by both parties, respectively, with regard to the admission of some of the said exhibits, as shown by the bill of exceptions. The court, in view of the evidence, and on May 25, 1909, rendered judgment by absolving the defendants, without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs on being notified of this judgment took exception thereto and made a written motion for a new trial, on the ground that the judgment excepted to was contrary to the weight of the evidence and to the law. This motion was overruled, exception was taken by the plaintiffs, and, on the presentation of the required bill of exceptions, the same was certified and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>It is claimed by the brothers Lorenzo and Melecio Fortuna that the spouses Aurea Corrales and Lazaro Alapriz should deliver to them the fruits of the 26 parcels of land or their value of P49.30, and they pray that the latter two be ordered to cease disturbing them in their quiet and peaceable possession of the said land and be sentenced forever to hold their peace, to pay P300 as losses and damages, and the costs of the trial. This petition was opposed by the defendants, who asked that they he absolved from the complaint, by reason of the defendant Aurea Corrales being the owner of the lands in question, and that the plaintiffs be sentenced to pay P350 as an indemnity for losses and damages, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>From the different kinds of evidence as shown by the record to have been introduced, it has been proven that the defendant spouses are in peaceable possession of the lands claimed, except those designated by the letters J, 0, P, and T, while the plaintiffs do not possess nor enjoy the said lands, and have in their favor a composition title issued by the <i>director general de administration civil<\/i> of the previous sovereignty, on February 8, 1893.<br\/><br\/>It is a question of <i>pro indiviso<\/i> property left at death by their reputed owner, Petrona Fortuna, who,, notwithstanding the fact that she executed a testament in July, 1889, did not name any heirs in it, nor did she dispose of the greater part of her property, but merely willed some of it to her husband and certain other relatives, among them her nephew Melecio. It is therefore considered that the testatrix, known to have been the owner of the said<i> pro indiviso<\/i> property, died intestate with respect to the major part of her property, and that her near relatives, according to the laws in force on the date of her death, are entitled to inherit such unbequeathed portion of her estate.<br\/><br\/>It is true that the purpose of this litigation is not at the present time the partition of her property, but, apparently, the determination as to the possession, and ownership of 26 parcels of land derived from the succession of the deceased Petrona Fortuna, which are now held by the defendant, who received them as a gift from a sister of the testatrix, Patricia Fortuna, who, however, was not an heir, but a mere administratrix.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs Lorenzo and Melecio Fortuna are nephews, sons of a brother of the deceased testatrix, and are consequently entitled to the intestate estate of the latter. However, their claim to the property in question is not founded by them on such hereditary right, but on a right of absolute ownership which they allege was enjoyed by their father during his lifetime, Valentin Fortuna, now deceased, and for this purpose they presented at the trial, as a title of ownership of the said land, the title issued by the <i>direccion general de administration civil,<\/i> by virtue of composition with the State.<br\/><br\/>So that, as against the title by gift alleged by the defendant Corrales, there exists that by composition presented by the plaintiffs. However, the latter, as shown by the proofs found in the record, were never, nor are they at the present time, in possession of the lands in dispute which they say belong to them and were inherited from their deceased father, the previous owner of the properties under a composition title; while the defendant, the sole possessor of the lands in question, substituted in the possession of the same as donee the donor, Patricia Fortuna, who had been in possession of them since the death of the testatrix, Petrona Fortuna, the record showing it to have been proven, by private documents, how and in what manner the testatrix had acquired the aforementioned lands.<br\/><br\/>When Valentin Fortuna died on October 25, 1906, his sister, Patricia Fortuna, was still living, and she succeeded the testatrix Petrona in the possession of the lands herein concerned and made a gift of them to the defendant, Aurea Corrales, according to a notarial instrument executed by the donor on February 19, 1908, prior to the letter's removal to the Island of Culion, where shortly afterwards she died of leprosy, from which she was suffering. The defendant, Corrales, in turn, then succeeded to the possession and enjoyment of these lands, according to the testimony of the tenants on shares who cultivated them, even while the donor, Patricia, was still living and with whom, as owner, they had contracted some ten years before, as some of these tenants testified; while several of them affirmed that the said Patricia, prior to her departure for Culion, charged them to make all arrangements after she was gone with the donee, Aurea Corrales. So that the record shows full proof that neither Valentin Fortuna, during his lifetime, nor afterwards his sons, now the plaintiffs, possessed in any manner whatever the lands in controversy, the possession of which has been successively held by the sisters Petrona and Patricia and finally by the said Aurea Corrales, the present possessor.<br\/><br\/>Although the possession of the land was an indispensable condition in order that, in accordance with the law, a title to the same by composition with the State might be obtained during the time of the previous sovereignty, and without discussing in this decision the legal value and juridical efficacy of the title issued by the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">direccion civil<\/span> on February 8, 1893, to Valentin Fortuna and presented by the plaintiffs for the purpose of accrediting their right to the land in question, it is nevertheless certain that the character of the action brought by the plaintiffs does not clearly appear in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the allegation therein made by the plaintiffs, that they are the owners and proprietors of the said lands, the record does not show that they brought an action for the recovery of possession, for they take it for granted that they are in possession of the lands although it is found that they are not, and they merely ask that the defendants be sentenced to deliver to them the fruits which the said defendants illegally collected, or their value, to forever hold their peace, to abstain from disturbing them in their quiet possession, and to pay an indemnity of P300, the amount of the losses and damages sustained.<br\/><br\/>Neither can it be deduced from these petitions that the plaintiffs intended to exercise a plenary action for possession, inasmuch as they categorically declare in the complaint that they are in present possession of the lands mentioned, this not being true.<br\/><br\/>It having been proved in an irrefutable manner, and beyond all peradventure of doubt, that neither the plaintiffs nor their predecessors in interest ever possessed the said lands, since they have been successively held without any interruption whatever by their original owner, Petrona, her sister, Patricia, and the donee, Aurea, all under the title of owners, it is understood of course that the petitions contained in the complaint are neither proper nor could be made, for the reason that they are within the competency of the proprietor or the possessor with the title of owner of the property from which the fruits claimed were derived.<br\/><br\/>If an action at law is the legal remedy which the citizen has at his command to ask through the courts for what is his own, or for what is owing him by another, it is indispensable that the said action, together with the grounds on which it is based, appear, clearly classified, in the complaint or claim, in order that the courts may be able to decide the matter at issue in accordance with the pleadings and evidence furnished by both parties.<br\/><br\/>Perhaps the title by composition presented by the plaintiffs might have served for filing suit for the recovery of possession; but as against the value and legal worth which such a title may have in itself, there exists the right acquired by the defendant, Aurea Corrales, in the said lands by virtue of public, adverse, and continuous possession in good faith, under good title, and for more than ten years, counting from the date of the above-mentioned composition title, under and in accordance with the provisions of section 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>However, leaving aside the said composition title, which perhaps is not as good as another might be, for the purpose of usurping an inheritance by some relatives to the detriment of others, and notwithstanding the before-mentioned deed of gift, the record shows it to have been fully proven: (1) That the lands in litigation belonged exclusively to the testatrix Petrona Fortuna, who acquired them by purchase from various persons very many years before the 8th of February, 1893, the date of the composition; (2) that the said testatrix did not name any heirs in her will, nor dispose of the said lands in favor of anyone, but only of their fruits; (3) that for the purpose of administering her property which was not bequeathed to the persons designated in her said will she appointed her sister, Patricia Fortuna, and, on the latter's death, her brother, Valentin, the plaintiffs' father; (4) that the said property still remains <i>pro indiviso<\/i> up to date, and all the nearest relatives of the testatrix are entitled to it, according to the provisions contained in articles 947, 948 et seq. of the Civil Code, notwithstanding the gift or donation made by Patricia Fortuna to the defendant, Aurea Corrales; and (5) that, in consideration of the reasons herein above set forth, the claims made by the plaintiffs can not be sustained.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, it is proper in our opinion, to affirm, as we hereby do, the judgment appealed from, without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

From\u00a0 this judgment the\u00a0 defendant appealed.<br\/><br\/>This cause concerns a double murder, committed at\u00a0 a late hour of the\u00a0 night of February 26,\u00a0 1909, the victims being\u00a0 the spouses Anastasio Gadacho and Juliana Gadqn, and while they were sound\u00a0 asleep in their house\u00a0 in\u00a0 the barrio of Despujol of the pueblo of Odiongan, Romblon, Province\u00a0 of Capiz\u00a0 a crime\u00a0 provided\u00a0 for and\u00a0 punished by article 403 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as its execution was attended by the qualifying circumstance of<i> alevosia.<\/i><br\/><br\/>A separate cause was\u00a0 prosecuted in the same Court\u00a0 of First Instance, under No. 253, and registered in this Supreme Court\u00a0 as\u00a0 No.\u00a0 6069,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>\u00a0 for\u00a0 the same crime, against Marcos Ambrosio and Alvaro Falsario, who were condemned by the trial court to the penalty of death, as the perpetrators of the said\u00a0 double murder, which sentence was confirmed by this court in its decision of November 12 of the present.<br\/><br\/>Isaac Fernandez was\u00a0 arrested and prosecuted in this cause as another of the supposed perpetrators of the\u00a0 crime alleged, upon the circumstantial evidence derived from the said testimony of the girl Pilar Falsario who, as it appears thereby, was not actually present at the time of the attack upon her\u00a0 mother and\u00a0 stepfather and only perceived\u00a0 the noise occasioned by the\u00a0 same,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that\u00a0 after\u00a0 she had gone out of the house and\u00a0 climbed up into a tree,\u00a0 from which\u00a0 point she heard her mother's voice calling her and asking for help, but she did not recognize the\u00a0 man who afterwards went out of the house.<br\/><br\/>The aforementioned circumstantial evidence was not corroborated by other data to conclusively prove the participation of the said defendant in the crimes under prosecution, for the said girl,\u00a0 who was\u00a0 not present during\u00a0 their commission, was unable to\u00a0 say that the man who came\u00a0 out of the house, in the\u00a0 darkness of night after she had heard her\u00a0 mother's cries, was\u00a0 Isaac\u00a0 Fernandez, for she\u00a0 did\u00a0 not recognize the man from the\u00a0 tree where she was perched.<br\/><br\/>The confession of having taken part in the perpetration of the double murder,\u00a0 said to\u00a0 have been\u00a0 made\u00a0 by\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 Fernandez before the justice of the peace of Odiongan,\u00a0 according to the statements of this official and other witnesses who testified that they heard the confession in the Aglipayan chapel\u00a0 of the barrio of Despujol,\u00a0 can\u00a0 not be admitted as conclusive and decisive proof of the\u00a0 defendant's guilt, since other witnesses who were present at\u00a0 the preliminary investigation held\u00a0 in the said chapel testified that the accused Fernandez, who had been apprehended a few moments before, manacled and handcuffed,\u00a0 was lying face down on\u00a0 the floor\u00a0 and suffering from\u00a0 pain\u00a0 and an abundant hemorrhage of blood\u00a0 from his wounds, especially from one in his head, of a serious nature, vomiting the food he had eaten, was dizzy, faint, very weak and not entirely conscious, according to the <i>curandero<\/i> or medical practitioner who applied petroleum to his serious wound; so that,\u00a0 according to this witness and two\u00a0 others who were present, the defendant, notwithstanding his being put face up at the time he was questioned by the justice of the peace, only answered by grunts and unintelligible words.\u00a0 Any statement which the accused may have\u00a0 made while in\u00a0 such a condition and situation can not be deemed by the courts to constitute\u00a0 proof\u00a0 of\u00a0 his\u00a0 guilt,\u00a0 although it be\u00a0 considered jointly with the circumstantial evidence based on the aforesaid testimony of the girl\u00a0 Pilar\u00a0 Falsario,\u00a0 and\u00a0 with that deduced from his flight, denied in turn by the accused; nor can it serve to support a conclusion sufficiently well founded for the imposition of an irreparable penalty like that of death.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, the accused Fernandez denied the charge and pleaded not guilty to having taken part in the double murder laid\u00a0 to him, and,\u00a0 as against his denial and allegation of having left the counselor's house,\u00a0 where he was detained, with the\u00a0 permission of the police corporal who with others was\u00a0 guarding\u00a0 him,\u00a0 to eat,\u00a0 the cause\u00a0 does\u00a0 not present meritorious\u00a0 and sufficient proof, expressly introduced, to produce in the mind beyond all doubt a full conviction of his guilt\u00a0 as an undoubted coprincipal of the double murder which is\u00a0 the subject of this prosecution, for it\u00a0 is not shown how and in what manner he escaped while under guard if it be untrue that he obtained the permission mentioned.<br\/><br\/>The attempt, arms in hand, and the tenacious resistance which the accused made against the local authority and his agents, when the latter tried to capture him after he had freed himself from\u00a0 his\u00a0 previous\u00a0 detention, a punishable act which should be the subject of separate prosecution and proceedings, must have biased the minds\u00a0 of the residents who exercised public authority, owing to the personal danger which some of them must\u00a0 have run and to\u00a0 the disorder which the said accused produced in the town; but such acts should in no\u00a0 wise be\u00a0 taken into\u00a0 account in\u00a0 an equitable judgment, according to the\u00a0 rules of\u00a0 sound reasoning upon the evidence, considered as an entirety and which has been adduced in this cause.<br\/><br\/>Section 57 of General Orders, No. 58, provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"A defendant in a criminal action shall be\u00a0 presumed to be innocent\u00a0 until the contrary is proved,\u00a0 and in\u00a0 case of a reasonable doubt that\u00a0 his guilt\u00a0 is satisfactorily\u00a0 shown he shall be entitled to an acquittal.\"<\/blockquote>For the foregoing reasons, and inasmuch as absolute and positive\u00a0 proof is\u00a0 lacking to show that\u00a0 Isaac Fernandez participated in the said\u00a0 murders, and the fact\u00a0 that\u00a0 his innocence is doubtful,\u00a0 not being sufficient to warrant\u00a0 his conviction, it is proper, in our opinion, with a reversal of the judgment submitted for review, to acquit and we hereby do acquit the\u00a0 defendant,\u00a0 with the costs of both instances <i>de oficio.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 Let the defendant be released from custody.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

but shortly thereafter Gellada,\u00a0 with the help of Filoteo Soliman,\u00a0 who was then living in the house, managed to catch him, and they at once bound and tied him with a rope to the partition of the\u00a0 house, and an hour later sent him to the\u00a0 justice of the peace of the town\u00a0 of Himamaylan, in charge of an officer of the barrio of which the said Gellada was a lieutenant.\u00a0 The servant was turned over to the justice of the peace and kept in detention during the whole of that night until 9 a. m. the next morning, the 25th, when the justice of the peace, being informed of the matter and of the contents of the official letter remitting the man,\u00a0 immediately ordered his release, there\u00a0 being no reason for his detention.<br\/><br\/>Subsequently\u00a0 a complaint was\u00a0 filed\u00a0 by the provincial fiscal with the Court of First Instance, charging Geronimo Gellada with the crime\u00a0 of illegal\u00a0 detention and\u00a0 ill\u00a0 treatment.\u00a0 The present proceedings were instituted,\u00a0 and the trial judge entered judgment on\u00a0 the 10th of\u00a0 September, 1907, sentencing the defendant to pay a fine of 500 pesetas and to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, with costs.\u00a0 From the said judgment the accused has appealed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .<br\/><br\/>The above-stated\u00a0 facts,\u00a0 fully proven\u00a0 in this case, are characteristic of the crime of arbitrary detention\u00a0 committed by an\u00a0 agent\u00a0 of the authority, such as is the lieutenant of a barrio, as defined by article 200, No. 1, of the\u00a0 Penal Code, inasmuch as, by order of the defendant,\u00a0 who was a lieutenant of the barrio,\u00a0 Sixto Gentugao was detained and taken to the justice of the\u00a0 peace, and, during many hours, deprived of his liberty without any lawful reason to justify such procedure, so that the said justice of the peace, upon being informed of the case on the following morning, set him at liberty.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 defendant testifies that\u00a0 he delivered\u00a0 the injured party to the justice of the peace with an official communication because, while the said party was drunk, he pushed the defendant and because, with the stick that he was\u00a0 carrying, he might have injured the inmates of defendant's house; but this allegation and\u00a0 the\u00a0 other exculpatory statements made by the defendant are not sustained, and the conflicting testimony\u00a0 of his witnesses has not weakened the evidence adduced by the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>It has, therefore, been proven, beyond all doubt, that the defendant, as lieutenant of the barrio, detained the injured party on the afternoon of January 24, 1907, and\u00a0 sent him to\u00a0 the justice\u00a0 of\u00a0 the peace without any\u00a0 reason\u00a0 therefor, such as the\u00a0 commission of a crime,\u00a0 and without having authority to do so, and that the said party only obtained his liberty\u00a0 on the following\u00a0 morning\u00a0 by the decision\u00a0 of\u00a0 the justice of the peace, in view of the fact that there was no reason for the detention.<br\/><br\/>The erroneous classification\u00a0 of the act set out in\u00a0 the complaint, and which\u00a0 is extremely damaging to the defendant, does not prevent his\u00a0 being declared guilty of the\u00a0 crime of arbitrary detention, nor can it affect the sentence that may be\u00a0 rendered when taking into consideration the fact that said crime was committed, inasmuch as both classifications refer to acts which are generically the same, if not identical, although they may be classified differently, according to the character with which the\u00a0 person who executed the same is\u00a0 invested;\u00a0 and, moreover, the commission of acts charged in an information is established by the evidence, not by the allegations of the parties.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the imposition of a fine as a penalty, as in the present case, the courts are empowered to use their authority to the full extent of the law, taking into consideration not only the\u00a0 mitigating\u00a0 and aggravating\u00a0 circumstances,\u00a0 but principally\u00a0 the financial\u00a0 condition and intelligence of the\u00a0 guilty person,\u00a0 as\u00a0 prescribed\u00a0 by article 83 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, in view of the fact that the\u00a0 judgment appealed from is in accordance with the law, it is our opinion that the same should\u00a0 be and\u00a0 is\u00a0 hereby\u00a0 affirmed with\u00a0 the costs against the accused.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The case comes before us <i>en consulta. <\/i><br\/><br\/>The first question presented for our consideration on this appeal is one\u00a0 of the fact, arising from the claim of the accused that the facts proved are not sufficient to\u00a0 warrant a conviction.<br\/><br\/>The court below found that - <br\/><blockquote>\"On the 26th day of August, 1904, a young woman by the name of Nicolasa Azucena left her home in the village of Concepcion\u00a0 with the intention of going to Ajuy,\u00a0 where she was to act as godmother at a christening.\u00a0 She was accompanied by her cousin, Bonifacio\u00a0 de Castro, and by two other men,\u00a0 Roman Alfonso Molina and Tomas Punsalan.\u00a0\u00a0 They walked along the road leading to Ajuy, carrying\u00a0 with them some clothing as well as certain small\u00a0 articles of jewelry and adornment to be used at the christening.\u00a0 They\u00a0 were overtaken on\u00a0 the\u00a0 way\u00a0 by darkness, but continued\u00a0 their journey until they arrived at a bridge known as Tibit, situated in a lonely and\u00a0 uninhabited spot, where they heard a voice issuing from the\u00a0 darkness, commanding them\u00a0 to halt.\u00a0\u00a0 They then saw a group of six men dressed\u00a0 in\u00a0 dark clothes who approached them stating that they were soldiers, or officers of the law, and demanded to see the cedulas of the male\u00a0 members\u00a0 of the party.\u00a0 These men,\u00a0 who\u00a0 were all armed with long\u00a0 bolos, rapidly approached the\u00a0 little party of travelers and\u00a0 separated the three men from the girl, two of the band carrying the latter away toward a place\u00a0 called Pinantan,\u00a0 where\u00a0 they made\u00a0 improper\u00a0 proposals to her, which being rejected they beat her with sticks and finally one of them stabbed her in the left breast\u00a0 with a dagger or bolo.\u00a0\u00a0 The unfortunate girl fell into\u00a0 a ditch by\u00a0 the roadside, where the miscreants\u00a0 left her\u00a0 for dead. She was, however, able\u00a0 to make her way slowly\u00a0 and painfully to the\u00a0 house of\u00a0 Bonifacio de\u00a0 Castro's father, where she died on the following day after making an <i>ante-mortem<\/i> statement concerning the\u00a0 attack upon her and\u00a0 her companions, Which statement was introduced in evidence\u00a0 and appears in the record.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Bonifacio de Castro, Roman Alfonso Molina, and Tomas Punsalan also fell victims to\u00a0 these\u00a0 bloodthirsty wretches, having been\u00a0 bound\u00a0 and cruelly murdered with the exception of\u00a0 De Castro, who survived the wounds inflicted upon\u00a0 him but became permanently disabled as the result thereof.\u00a0 During the course of these proceedings the assailants forcibly and by means of violence and intimidation possessed\u00a0 themselves of all\u00a0 the property carried by their victims, including Roman Alfonso Molina's and Nicolasa Azucena's clothing, as well\u00a0 as\u00a0 the articles which\u00a0 Nicolasa had brought along for use at\u00a0 the christening.\u00a0 It is unnecessary to\u00a0 dwell further\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the painful details\u00a0 of this heartless crime, it being sufficient to state that the evidence fully and clearly establishes the guilt of the\u00a0 perpetrators of the deed of the complex\u00a0 crime of robbery with homicide, as denned and penalized by article 502 in\u00a0 connection with paragraph 1 of article 503 of\u00a0 the Penal\u00a0 Code, with\u00a0 the aggravating circumstances of\u00a0 the culprits having taken advantage of the\u00a0 cover of darkness, committed the crime in a\u00a0 gang and in an uninhabited place (par. 15, art. 10, Penal Code); treachery\u00a0 (par. 2, art.\u00a0 10, Penal\u00a0 Code);\u00a0 employment of craft, fraud, and\u00a0 disguise (par. 8, art.\u00a0 10, Penal Code); taking advantage of superior strength (par. 9, art, 10, Penal Code); committing the crime with the assistance of armed persons\u00a0 (par. 14,\u00a0 art.\u00a0 10, Penal Code).\"<\/blockquote>After an attentive examination of the\u00a0 record in\u00a0 this case and a careful reading of the evidence presented on the trial, we are satisfied beyond\u00a0 question\u00a0 that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged.\u00a0 His\u00a0 guilt is established\u00a0 not only by the direct\u00a0 testimony presented,\u00a0 but also by every circumstance which the\u00a0 case\u00a0 discloses.\u00a0 At the\u00a0 time\u00a0 of Laguna's arrest there was found in his\u00a0 possession part of the clothing\u00a0 taken from the victims of the assault,\u00a0 which the accused expressly admitted to the justice of the peace of the town of Sara was his share of the plunder resulting from the crime.\u00a0 Moreover, when arrested, he was wearing a pair of white trousers marked with the name \"Alfonso\" and an undershirt bearing the initials\u00a0 \"R.\u00a0 A. M.,\" manifestly part of the clothing of Roman Alfonso Molina.\u00a0 That the accused was one\u00a0 of the perpetrators of this frightful crime can not be doubted.<br\/><br\/>We have therefore no hesitation whatever in affirming the decision of the trial court upon the facts.<br\/><br\/>The only\u00a0 other question\u00a0 before the court on this appeal is that of former jeopardy.\u00a0 This question was presented for the first time on appeal,\u00a0\u00a0 It was not raised in the court below.\u00a0 Passing the question whether or not it can be presented here on appeal\u00a0 for the first time, we are clearly of the opinion that\u00a0 the defense must be\u00a0 disallowed for other reasons.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the record that the trial,\u00a0 so called, from the judgment of conviction in which this appeal is taken, was\u00a0 the second time\u00a0 that the accused had\u00a0 been tried for this\u00a0 same offense.\u00a0\u00a0 Some time before his trial in\u00a0 the\u00a0 case at bar he had been tried upon a complaint charging him with the crime of which he now stands convicted\u00a0 and had been found\u00a0 guilty\u00a0 of\u00a0 that offense and sentenced to death. Upon making up the\u00a0 record for transmission to this court to be used en consulta, it was found that that\u00a0 portion of the same containing the testimony could not be\u00a0 found.\u00a0 A careful search through the records of the court, followed by an investigation by\u00a0 the Attorney-General extending over several months, failed to disclose the missing record.\u00a0 That portion of the case which\u00a0 remained intact having in the meantime reached\u00a0 this\u00a0 court, an application was made by the Attorney-General for the return\u00a0 of the record to the trial court\u00a0 in order\u00a0 that the evidence might be retaken for presentation to this court.\u00a0 In\u00a0 response to such application, this court made an order setting aside the judgment of conviction\u00a0 and\u00a0 sentence\u00a0 previously rendered\u00a0 and returning the cause to the trial court for a\u00a0 rehearing.\u00a0 In that\u00a0 trial, conducted by the Hon. James Ross, judge of the Court of First Instance, the\u00a0 defendant was again found guilty of said crime and again sentenced to\u00a0 death.<br\/><br\/>Upon these facts the defendant raises here the question of former\u00a0 jeopardy,\u00a0 alleging that the\u00a0 second trial was in violation of the Philippine\u00a0 Bill and\u00a0 of\u00a0 the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br\/><br\/>The proceeding in this jurisdiction when the death penalty has been imposed by the trial court is somewhat unusual. Section\u00a0 26\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Code of\u00a0 Criminal Procedure, General Orders,\u00a0 No. 58, reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"When a defendant shall have\u00a0 been convicted or acquitted or\u00a0 once placed\u00a0 in,jeopardy\u00a0 upon an\u00a0 information or complaint,' the\u00a0 conviction, acquittal,\u00a0 or\u00a0 jeopardy shall be a bar to another information or indictment for the offense charged, or for an\u00a0 attempt to commit the\u00a0 same,\u00a0 or for a frustration\u00a0 thereof,\u00a0 or for any offense necessarily therein included of which he might have been convicted under such complaint or information.\"<\/blockquote>Section 50 of General Orders, No. 58 [as amended], reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It shall not be\u00a0 necessary to forward to the\u00a0 Supreme Court the record, or any part thereof, of\u00a0 any case\u00a0 in which there shall have been an acquittal, or in which the sentence imposed is not death, unless such\u00a0 case shall have been duly appealed; but such\u00a0 sentences shall be executed\u00a0 upon the order of the court in which the trial was had.\u00a0 The records of all cases in which\u00a0 the death penalty shall have\u00a0 been imposed by any Court of First Instance, whether the defendant shall have\u00a0 appealed or not, and\u00a0 of all\u00a0 cases in which appeals shall have been taken shall be forwarded to the Supreme Court for investigation and judgment as law and justice shall dictate.\u00a0 The records of such cases\u00a0 shall be forwarded to the clerk of the\u00a0 Supreme Court within twenty\u00a0 days, but not earlier than fifteen\u00a0 days after the rendition of sentence.\"<\/blockquote>It is apparent from\u00a0 these\u00a0 provisions that the judgment of Conviction' and\u00a0 sentence thereunder by the trial court does not; in reality, conclude the trial of the accused.\u00a0\u00a0 Such trial is not terminated until the Supreme Court has reviewed the facts and the law as applied thereto by the court below. The judgment of conviction entered\u00a0 on the trial is not final, can not be executed, and is wholly without force or effect until the cause has been passed upon by the Supreme Court.\u00a0 In a sense the trial court acts as a commissioner who takes the testimony and\u00a0 reports thereon to the Supreme Court with his\u00a0 recommendation.\u00a0 While in practice he enters\u00a0 a judgment of\u00a0 conviction and\u00a0 sentences the prisoner thereunder, in reality, until\u00a0 passed upon by the Supreme Court, it has none of\u00a0 the attributes\u00a0 of\u00a0 a\u00a0 final judgment and\u00a0 sentence.\u00a0\u00a0 It is\u00a0 a\u00a0 mere recommendation to the Supreme Court, based upon\u00a0 the facts and the record which are\u00a0 presented with it.\u00a0\u00a0 This is meant in no sense to detract from the dignity and power of Courts of First Instance.\u00a0\u00a0 It means simply that that portion of\u00a0 Spanish procedure which related to cases where capital punishment was imposed still survives.<br\/><br\/>It is evident, therefore,\u00a0 that until the Supreme Court has passed upon the cause\u00a0 en consulta the trial\u00a0 of the accused is not finished, and jeopardy, although it may have attached, has not been terminated.\u00a0\u00a0 In principle, it is very much like those cases in which\u00a0 it\u00a0 has been held that, though, in general, jeopardy begins when the trial begins, yet if afterwards, and before a decision has been reached, some unforeseen circumstance arises which renders it impossible for the trial to proceed or for a valid\u00a0 judgment to be rendered, the trial\u00a0 may be\u00a0 suspended\u00a0 and\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant again put on trial for the same\u00a0 offense.\u00a0 Whether this exception with respect to the general rule relating to former jeopardy is put on the ground of necessity which requires a modification of the doctrine in the interests of public justice Nugent <i> vs.<\/i> State, 24 Am. Dec,\u00a0 746; People <i>vs.<\/i> Goodwin, 18 Johns., 187), or whether on the ground that the supervening facts show that no jeopardy ever existed\u00a0 (Bishop's Crim. Law, par. 1031; Mixon <i>vs<\/i>. State, 55 Ala., 129; 4 Crim. L. Mag., 488), or whether on the ground that though jeopardy has attached it has never ended (Wharton's Crim. PL &amp; Pr., par. 508; 4 Crim. L. Mag., 488), the\u00a0 result is the same.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Simmons <i>vs<\/i>. U. S. (142 U. S., 148), it was held that when it is made to appear to the court during the trial of a criminal case that either by reason of\u00a0 facts existing when the jurors were sworn but not then disclosed or known to the court,\u00a0 or by reason of outside influence brought to\u00a0 bear\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 jury\u00a0 pending trial, the jurors or any of them are subject to such bias or prejudice as not to stand impartial between the government and the accused, the jury may be discharged and the defendant put on trial by another\u00a0 jury, and the defendant is not thereby twice put in jeopardy within the meaning of the fifth amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\u00a0 This principle is laid\u00a0 down and followed in People <i>vs<\/i>. Goodwin (18 Johns., 187); Mixon <i>vs.<\/i> State (55 Ala., 129); State <i>vs.<\/i> Emery (59 Vt.,\u00a0 84); State <i>vs.<\/i> Falconer (75 Ia., 416);\u00a0 U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Perez (9\u00a0 Wheat.,\u00a0 579); Commonwealth <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Bowden\u00a0 (9 Mass., 494);\u00a0 Commonwealth <i>vs<\/i>. Purchase (2 Pick., 521); State <i>vs<\/i>. Washington (89 N. C, 535); State <i>vs<\/i>. Washington (90 N. C, 664); <i>Re<\/i> Ascher (130 Mich., 540); U.\u00a0 S.\u00a0 <i>vs<\/i>. Ballentine\u00a0 (4 Phil. Rep., 672).<br\/><br\/>It was not intended by the provisions of the Constitution or of the Code of Criminal Procedure providing against an accused being placed twice in jeopardy for the same offense to destroy or disrupt the system of procedure which is provided for the trial of criminals in the country in which such provisions are\u00a0 in\u00a0 force.\u00a0\u00a0 The purpose of\u00a0 such\u00a0 constitutional provisions is simply to protect the accused from going through a second time the proceedings which constitute the trial under the system then in vogue, whatever that system may be.\u00a0 Here the proceedings which constitute the trial of the accused are not terminated by that portion had in the\u00a0 Court of First Instance.\u00a0 They are terminated\u00a0 only when the Supreme Court has passed upon them en consulta. Until that time arrives, jeopardy, although it has attached, has not terminated,\u00a0 and during that time the proceedings may, by reason of unforeseen\u00a0 circumstances, be suspended and the case returned for action <i>de novo.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Every person who finds himself in a court of justice, in whatever capacity, must\u00a0 hold himself while there subject to those unforeseen events which suddenly and unavoidably intervene and\u00a0 change\u00a0 the whole aspect of\u00a0 things.\u00a0 The sickness\u00a0 or death of the judge, or of counsel for the prosecution, the destruction by fire or flood of the court-house and all the records and\u00a0 evidence of the pending trial -\u00a0 any of these things are sufficient\u00a0 to interrupt the course of the proceedings and to require\u00a0 that\u00a0 they be\u00a0 begun anew. Such events weigh equally against all.\u00a0 As no one can be charged with their occurrence, so no one can legally lose or profit by their results.\u00a0\u00a0 While the law protects persons charged\u00a0 with\u00a0 crime from the unjust and\u00a0 arbitrary\u00a0 acts of man, there is no shield which may be interposed against the tyranny of unforeseen events.\u00a0\u00a0 Until the\u00a0 proceedings which, under the\u00a0 system which the law\u00a0 provides,\u00a0 constitute his trial are terminated,\u00a0 the\u00a0 happening of an unforeseen\u00a0 event\u00a0 which renders the continuance of\u00a0 his trial for the time impossible, as it can not be\u00a0 used for his\u00a0 conviction, can not be urged for his\u00a0 absolution.\u00a0 As the burning of this court-house with all the criminal records which it\u00a0 contains could not be used as a basis for the affirmance of the convictions of all\u00a0 those whose causes are pending in this court, so the same event could not be urged as a reason for the\u00a0 delivery of such\u00a0 persons\u00a0 from jail on the ground that a retrial would be a second jeopardy.<br\/><br\/>The requirement that the Supreme Court pass upon a case in which capital punishment has been imposed by the sentence\u00a0 of the trial court\u00a0 is. one having for its\u00a0 object simply and solely\u00a0 the\u00a0 protection of\u00a0 the accused.\u00a0 Having received the highest penalty\u00a0 which the law imposes, he\u00a0 is entitled under that law to have\u00a0 the\u00a0 sentence\u00a0 and all the facts and circumstances upon which it is founded placed before the highest tribunal of the land to the end that its justice and legality may be clearly and conclusively determined.\u00a0 Such\u00a0 procedure\u00a0 is merciful.\u00a0 It gives\u00a0 a second chance for life.\u00a0\u00a0 Neither\u00a0 the courts\u00a0 nor\u00a0 the accused can waive it.\u00a0 It is a positive\u00a0 provision of the law that brooks no interference and tolerates no evasions.\u00a0 Unforeseen and fortuitous events interrupt it only for the moment.\u00a0\u00a0 When they are spent, the measured power of the law resumes its way and its unfulfilled provisions proceed to enforcement.<br\/><br\/>So when\u00a0 the proceedings which constituted the trial of the accused in this case under the system of procedure in force here were interrupted and stayed\u00a0 by the destruction of the most important element in the record of\u00a0 the\u00a0 cause, that portion of the proceeding's which, perhaps,\u00a0 most perfectly assures the protection\u00a0 of his rights had not yet been\u00a0 fulfilled.\u00a0 In other words,\u00a0 when the accident to the record occurred, the accused had not yet been fully\u00a0 tried; the cause, on the part of the prosecution as well\u00a0 as the accused, had\u00a0 not\u00a0 been terminated.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 was still in\u00a0 progress.\u00a0\u00a0 It was not\u00a0 then known, in reality,\u00a0 whether he was convicted or acquitted.\u00a0 Certain recommendations had been made by the Court of First Instance,\u00a0 but they had not been passed\u00a0 upon or even\u00a0 considered.\u00a0 To sustain the plea of former jeopardy,\u00a0 it is necessary not only\u00a0 that jeopardy shall\u00a0 have attached but that\u00a0 it\u00a0 shall be terminated; that is, that the proceeding on account of which the jeopardy exists shall\u00a0 have ended.\u00a0\u00a0 To terminate jeopardy, it\u00a0 is not necessary that there be a formal final\u00a0 judgment of conviction or acquittal.\u00a0 Any act of the\u00a0 court terminating the proceeding without the consent of the accused, not founded upon some\u00a0 constraining necessity\u00a0 arising\u00a0 from circumstances over which\u00a0 the court has no control, terminates the jeopardy, and a retrial violates the constitutional rights of the accused.\u00a0 Such an\u00a0 act is,\u00a0 by operation of law, an acquittal of the accused.<br\/><br\/>Jeopardy can not be\u00a0 terminated by an accident.\u00a0\u00a0 Such an event merely interrupts or suspends it. Generally speaking, the law does not operate upon pure accidents or\u00a0 lend legal force or significance to them as\u00a0 such.\u00a0 This is\u00a0 especially so in\u00a0 matters of procedure.<br\/><br\/>It is possible that a different question would have been presented if the\u00a0 loss\u00a0 of the record\u00a0 had been due to\u00a0 the negligence of\u00a0 the officer of the law\u00a0 who had it in charge. We would then have had before us the question of how far an accused person may be made to suffer for the negligence or blunders of\u00a0 those officers of the\u00a0 law who have to do with\u00a0 his trial or with the records relating to it.\u00a0 In the case actually before us there is evidence only of the loss of the record by accident, pure and\u00a0 simple, without negligence on the part of any person charged with a duty.<br\/><br\/>Under the Spanish system a person was not in jeopardy in the legal sense until there had been a final judgment in the court of last resort.\u00a0 That this was the case may be seen from reading the Spanish authorities:<br\/><blockquote>\"After a man, accused of any crime, has been acquitted by the court, no one can afterwards accuse him of the same offense\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Puero Real,\u00a0 law 18, title 20, book 4.)<br\/><br\/>\"It is another of the\u00a0 general exceptions that a person can not be accused who has formerly been accused and adjudged of the same crime, since the most essential of all judicial decisions upon which\u00a0 execution\u00a0 can issue\u00a0 is to constitute unalterable law.\"\u00a0 (Ency. of Law, Lorenzo Arrazola, vol. 1, p. 511.)<br\/><br\/>\"If a man is <i>acquitted by a valid judgment<\/i> of any offense of which he\u00a0 has been\u00a0 accused, no person\u00a0 can afterwards accuse him of the offense\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"\u00a0 (Seven Partidas, law 12, title 1, partida 7.)<\/blockquote>Under that system\u00a0 the lower courts were\u00a0 regarded as examining courts, having preliminary jurisdiction, and the accused was not fully convicted or acquitted until the case had been passed upon by the <i>Audiencia,<\/i> or supreme court, whose judgment was subject to review in the supreme court at Madrid for errors of law, with power to order a new trial.\u00a0\u00a0 The trial was regarded as\u00a0 one continuous proceeding, and the protection given was against a second conviction after this final trial had been concluded in due form of law. The\u00a0 change made by\u00a0 the introduction of American\u00a0 law affected only those cases where the capital penalty is not imposed.\u00a0 As to those cases, the Spanish system remains in force by virtue of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure above quoted.\u00a0 (Kepner <i>vs<\/i>. United\u00a0 States, 195 U. S., 100.)<br\/><br\/>It necessarily\u00a0 follows, then, that the former jeopardy which the accused pleads as a defense was not terminated and the retaking of\u00a0 the evidence before Judge Ross was not a second jeopardy.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons\u00a0 the judgment of\u00a0 conviction\u00a0 and the sentence imposed thereunder are hereby affirmed, and the judgment\u00a0 and sentence of the court below are made the judgment and sentence of this court.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

The information alleges that on or about the 29th of May, 1908, the defendants, with Anastasio Granadoso, who escaped, all armed with bolos, maliciously and criminally secreted themselves in an uninhabited place near the road between Tarlac and La Paz, and as Julia Atienza, Adriano Fajardo, Egmidio Mendoza, Eugenia Manuel, Alejandro Valentino, Maximo Gamit, and Aurelia Aliega were passing the said place, attacked these persons, demanding money of them, and as they had no money, these defendants by means of violence and intimidation took from the said persons various effects, worth about 60 centavos.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the proofs adduced and the arguments of counsel, the lower court found these defendants guilty as charged in the complaint and sentenced each of them to ten years of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">presidio mayor,<\/span> with the corresponding accessories, to return the effects to the injured parties and in case of their failure to return the said effects to indemnify the said Julia Atienza in the sum of 14 centavos, Aurelia Aliega in the sum of 35 centavos, and Maximo Gamit in the sum of P1.50.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>On the afternoon of March 29, 1908, these defendants, in company with another person who was absent at the time this trial took place, all armed with bolos, with their faces blackened with coal, attacked the parties mentioned in the complaint and forced them to lie down with their faces to the ground. The defendants then tied some of the men and by means of force and intimidation robbed Julia Atienza of effects worth 14 centavos, Aurelia Aliega of effects worth 35 centavos, and Maximo Gamit of a bolo worth Pi.50. When this assault was made the defendants demanded money of their victims, but were unable to obtain any, for the reason that they had none in their possession at that time.<br\/><br\/>This crime was committed in an uninhabited place between the towns of Tarlac and La Paz, and at the time of its commission the faces of the defendants were disguised so that they could not be easily recognized. The defendants selected this uninhabited place to commit this crime in order that the victims could not receive assistance or be heard. They disguised themselves for the purpose of avoiding recognition. The victims could not recognize, at the time the robbery was committed, any of the defendants except Modesto Cabula, who was recognized by Adriano Fajardo.<br\/><br\/>Jose Guillermo and Epifanio Tacusalme, two witnesses for the prosecution, testified that they were captured by these ladrones and forced to assist in this robbery, and that in fact they were present at the time and place of the robbery and were compelled to assist in the commission of the same by guarding the victims while these defendants robbed them. The court below considered that the testimony of Jose Guillermo and Epifanio Tacusalme was corroborated by that of Adriano Fajardo, the latter having recognized one of the defendants, and accepted their testimony as being true. We think the court below very properly declined to accept the testimony of the defendants.<br\/><br\/>It is not questioned that the offended parties were robbed at the time and place mentioned in the complaint. The defendant, Modesto Cabalu, was recognized as one of the robbers. Jose Guillermo and Epifanio Tacusalme were present and took part in this robbery, but they state that they were compelled to do so by the defendants. Considering their testimony as that of accomplices, the guilt of the defendants has been established beyond any question of doubt. The testimony of these two accomplices is corroborated by the positive testimony of Adriano Fajardo, who recognized one of the defendants at the time the crime was committed.<br\/><blockquote>\"While the evidence of accomplices or confederates is always subject to grave suspicion, 'coming, as it does, from a polluted source\/ and should be received with great caution and doubtingly examined, it is, nevertheless, admissible and competent.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S.<i> vs.<\/i> Ocampo, 4 Phil. Rep., 400.)<br\/><br\/>\"The lack of corroboration of the testimony of confederates or accomplices merely affects the credibility of the witness, and does not affect his competency or the admissibility of his testimony.\" (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Ocampo, 5 Phil. Rep., 339.)<br\/><br\/>\"If the uncorroborated testimony of a confederate or accomplice satisfies the court as to the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, it is sufficient.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Id.)<\/blockquote>Counsel for the appellants does not question the guilt of the defendants, but asks the court to modify the judgment of the Court of First Instance by reducing the penalty from ten years to six years ten months and one day, basing his petition on the amount of damage caused and insisting that in view of the fact that the value of the effects taken by the defendants is so small the court should take this fact into consideration and reduce the penalty. Counsel admits that the crime committed by the defendants is that of robbery in band, with the aggravating circumstance of being disguised.<br\/><blockquote>\"The greater or less value of the property stolen can have no bearing on the penalty to be imposed.\" * * * (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. De los Santos, 6 Phil. Rep., 411.)<br\/><\/blockquote>All the elements constituting the crime of robbery in band have been established by the prosecution, inasmuch as it has been shown that more than three of these malefactors were armed at the time of the commission of the crime. The trial court very properly considered the aggravating circumstances of the crime having been committed in an uninhabited place and by these defendants who were disguised. No extenuating circumstances were found to exist.<br\/><br\/>The sentence and judgment of the lower court being in accordance with the law and the merits of the case, the same is affirmed with costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

NICOLAS CLAVANO, DEFENDANT  AND APPELLEE.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On March 10, 1909, Felix Angao filed a written complaint with the Court of First Instance of Misamis, in which it was alleged that in 1899 the plaintiff made a contract\u00a0 of the kind known in the locality as a pledge contract and sanctioned by local custom - with Ambrosio Bugahud, whereby Angao granted the use of his land, planted with 120 coconut trees, to the said Bugahud in exchange for 43 pesos which he had received from the latter as a loan, under the condition that the plaintiff should\u00a0 be bound after his\u00a0 marriage to repay the said sum to the creditor who in turn should\u00a0 return the\u00a0 land, situated\u00a0 in\u00a0 the place called Ynamucan\u00a0 of the pueblo of Langaran, Misamis, and bounded on the north and east by land of Gervasio\u00a0 Poriran and\u00a0 Mariano Bugahud, and on the south and west by a\u00a0 mangrove swamp.\u00a0 The complaint\u00a0 further\u00a0 alleged\u00a0 that the\u00a0 plaintiff married in October, 1906, and that in\u00a0 the same year, after his marriage, he\u00a0 offered\u00a0 to pay his said debt in order that his creditor might return to him his\u00a0 coconut land,\u00a0 but that Ambrosio Bugahud then told him that the property was in the possession of Nicolas Clavano, to whom he had deeded his rights in the said land; that, although the debtor, in company with Bugahud, made a demand upon Clavano for the restitution of the land and offered to pay him the said sum, Clavano refused to accept the said 43 pesos and persisted in refusing to return to him the coconut plantation\u00a0 and to accept the 43 pesos on the several occasions when he was requested to do so by the plaintiff.\u00a0 It was therefore prayed that judgment be entered\u00a0 against the defendant by ordering him to\u00a0 accept the said 43 pesos and to deliver the coconut plantation to its\u00a0 owner, the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The defendant,\u00a0 Nicolas\u00a0 Clavano, in his answer\u00a0 denied each and all the facts alleged in the complaint in each\u00a0 and all\u00a0 the paragraphs thereof, and asked that he be absolved from the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The case having come to trial the attorneys of the litigating parties presented, during the taking of the evidence, the written agreement,\u00a0 consisting of ten pages, in which it appears that\u00a0 the\u00a0 Exhibit A, thereto attached as a part thereof, is the contract entered into between Felix Angao and Nicolas Clavano with respect to this land in question, and that this land\u00a0 is the same that is described in the complaint and mentioned in the document Exhibit A.<br\/><br\/>In view of the evidence adduced the trial court, on July 27,\u00a0 1909,\u00a0 rendered judgment by absolving the defendant from the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff who, oh being notified\u00a0 thereof, took an exception thereto and filed\u00a0 an appeal before this court, for which purpose the proper bill of exceptions\u00a0 was presented, certified to and forwarded to the clerk of\u00a0 this court.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 plaintiff demands\u00a0 the fulfillment of the obligation contracted by the defendant by virtue of an agreement, with right of repurchase stipulated in the sale of a parcel of land, as specified in the\u00a0 instrument written in the dialect of the province, a translation of which is inserted in the judgment appealed from.\u00a0 The said obligation\u00a0 consists in that the defendant\u00a0 shall accept\u00a0 the amount of\u00a0 the\u00a0 repurchase and deliver\u00a0 the land sold, to the plaintiff, the owner thereof.<br\/><br\/>But before entering\u00a0 into a consideration\u00a0 of the issues raised and\u00a0 the errors\u00a0 attributed to the judgment of the trial court in the appeal raised by\u00a0 the plaintiff, it must\u00a0 be borne in mind that\u00a0 this court\u00a0 is obliged to accept the statement of facts\u00a0 and the\u00a0 findings as to the weight of the evidence, such as they appear in\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment appealed from, and\u00a0 has\u00a0 no\u00a0 authority\u00a0 to examine the former nor review the latter, inasmuch as the appellant did not petition for an annulment of the said judgment and the granting of a new trial.\u00a0 This\u00a0 court\u00a0 must, therefore, restrict its action in the present litigation to\u00a0 a determination of the issues of law.\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec. 497, Code of Civil Procedure,\u00a0 and Act No. 1596, which modified\u00a0 that section.)<br\/><br\/>Under the foregoing premises, and in consideration\u00a0 of the fact that the plaintiff Felix Angao allowed the year following that of his marriage, celebrated on September\u00a0 8, 1903, to lapse without having availed himself of his right to repurchase the land\u00a0 sold under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> to Nicolas Clavano., it is unquestionable that he has lost his right to repurchase or recover the property sold, and that the purchaser's right therein has, by operation of the law, become perfected.<br\/><br\/>The contract set forth in the instrument above mentioned contains a condition, which is the marriage and a certain period of time after which\u00a0 the right of repurchase shall lapse.\u00a0\u00a0 It was covenanted that if, after one year from the time\u00a0 of the marriage\u00a0 of the plaintiff Angao, the latter should not redeem the land sold, the vendee, the defendant Clavano, would be\u00a0 the\u00a0 true owner of the coconut land\u00a0 in question, and the vendor Angao should only be entitled\u00a0 to claim from the former the sum of 20 pesos as an additional pries of the said land.<br\/><br\/>Angao married on\u00a0 September 8, 1903, from which\u00a0 date he was entitled to redeem the land sold by\u00a0 him, inasmuch as the condition stipulated between the contracting parties had\u00a0 been\u00a0 complied with, to\u00a0 wit, the marriage of one of them.\u00a0 On September 9, 1904, the year\u00a0 immediately following the date of defendant's marriage had already fully elapsed and, up to the 8th of September of the said\u00a0 year, that being the last day of the year following his marriage, he had not yet repurchased the property, therefore, from the said date, September 9, defendant's right had\u00a0 already lapsed, for the year had passed and\u00a0 this last date arrived without his having repurchased the land.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 trial court found, in\u00a0 its judgment, that when the plaintiff wished to\u00a0 redeem the land and offered to\u00a0 repay the P43 in August, 1906, more than one year had elapsed since his marriage.\u00a0\u00a0 This judicial finding can not be set aside, inasmuch as it is impossible to review the evidence in the case, and even were it possible to do so, the record does not show that the plaintiff demanded\u00a0 of the defendant the redemption of the land by offering him, in the act of making the demand, the payment of its price, nor that the latter was deposited with\u00a0 some\u00a0 authority\u00a0 or with\u00a0 a commissioned notary within the\u00a0 period\u00a0 of\u00a0 one year counting from the date of the defendant's\u00a0 marriage, since on the arrival of the 9th of September, 1904, he had already lost his right, according to the agreement.\u00a0 (Arts. 1508, 1509, Civil Code.) Article 1518 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The vendor can not exercise the\u00a0 right of\u00a0 redemption without returning to the vendee the price of the\u00a0 sale.\"<\/blockquote>So that it is not\u00a0 sufficient for the vendor to\u00a0 intimate or to state\u00a0 to the vendee that the\u00a0 former desires to\u00a0 redeem the thing sold, but he must\u00a0 immediately\u00a0 thereupon\u00a0 offer to repay the price,\u00a0 and, should the vendee refuse to accept the amount of the\u00a0 price thus offered,\u00a0 it must be placed on deposit, for if these conditions are not complied with,\u00a0 as in the present case,\u00a0 the provisions of article 1509 of the Civil Code become applicable,\u00a0 wherein it is provided that \"if the vendor should not comply with the provisions of article\u00a0 1518, the vendee shall\u00a0 irrevocably acquire\u00a0 the\u00a0 ownership of the thing sold.\"<br\/><br\/>For\u00a0 the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors\u00a0 alleged have been disposed of,\u00a0 and the\u00a0 judgment appealed\u00a0 from being in\u00a0 accordance\u00a0 with the law, it is\u00a0 hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Said property is bounded on the northeast by the said <i>estero<\/i>, on the southeast by the Escolta, on the southwest by Calle David, and on the northwest by the property of Vicente Gonzalez, having an area of 2,124 square meters and 43 square decimeters, 1,904 square meters and 21 square decimeters of which are covered by buildings. The description and boundaries of the said land are given in detail in the plan which accompanied the application. It was further alleged that, at the last assessment, the property was appraised at P280,974\u00a0 - the land at P201,974, and the building at P79,000; that there was no encumbrance of any kind on the said property, nor any person who might consider himself entitled to a right, share, or interest therein, according to the applicant's best knowledge and belief; that the latter, Luis Perez y Samanillo, acquired the lot and buildings by inheritance from his deceased mother, Agustina Samanillo y Fragoso, the widow of the deceased Manuel Perez y Marqueti, the applicant's mother having died in Barcelona, Spain, on March 17,1901; that the applicant had no objection to make with regard to the way the streets were then laid out; and that the premises were occupied by several tenants, whose names are given in the application.<br\/><br\/>After the publications and notifications had been made in connection with the said application, counsel for the spouses Vicente Gonzalez and Manuela E. Salvador y Padilla, the owners of the adjoining premises, filed an adverse petition wherein it was stated that the plan presented by the applicant, on the side marked with the letters E, F, G, D, E, overlapped the division line of the land belonging to the opponents, the applicant thereby appropriating to himself a piece of vacant land of about sixty square meters which forms a part of the opponents' property; that aside from the fact that the said land was in the possession of the deceased, Narciso Padilla, from the year 1835, his descendant, Maria Barbara Padilla, continued to possess it for more than fifty years using it as a place for the storage of lumber, for at the end of the wall on the premises of the present owners there still exists a wooden door 2 varas in height by one and a half in width which, since 1835, has been the entrance to the piece of land in question, and that the eaves of the rodf of the opponents' house project more than half a vara from the wall of the house over the said small court into which the water from the roof of the building falls; that in this latter there is a window about 3 varas high by two and a half wide, with an iron grating, both of which project from the wall about half a vara over the said court, which window was opened in 1851 and has since served to admit light into the room to which it belongs; that the foregoing details prove that the said space of land has never belonged to the applicant, because there is no entrance from the latter's property to the said court. The opponent therefore prayed that, in view of his adverse claim, the case be admitted to trial and the witnesses summoned, and in support of his petition he exhibited the documents marked \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C.\"<br\/><br\/>During the hearing of the case the parties thereto agreed that on the lines D, E, and F R there is a window 3<i> varas<\/i> in height by two and a half in width, which projects half a vara from the wall of the opponents' house, and also that there is a door on the latter's premises through which access may be had to the land in dispute, and that the eaves of the roof of the opponents' house project more than half a vara over the said land. The judge ordered that the court, attended by both litigants, should repair to the disputed land in order that the latter might agree upon the fact of the existence or nonexistence of a chamfer alleged by the opponents' attorney.<br\/><br\/>The court, attended by the attorneys of both the litigating parties, by the applicant's attorneys in fact, and by an expert presented by the opponents, having repaired to the land in question for the purposes of ocular inspection, it was found that the lines D, E, and E F of the plan exactly mark the line of the wall of the opponents' house; that the said house had eaves projecting over the land in litigation and shed their water thereon; that in the wall of the said house toward the court in question there was a window, with an iron grating, about 2.20 meters in height by 1.20 in width, and on the ground floor a door for entrance to the disputed land; that in the wall of the applicant's house, line M N, there were five windows in the first story, and five others in the second story, and that the roof of this building also projected over the disputed land or court, where the applicant's water drain is situated.\u00a0\u00a0 The latter's attorney called attention to the fact that the opponents' house is surrounded by balconies, except toward the part in litigation, and that the eaves of the opponents' house, which projected over the said land, had a lesser extension.\u00a0\u00a0 The opponents' attorney being questioned as to the age of the two adjoining buildings replied that, according to a statement of the witness Maria Barbara Padilla, her father acquired the opponents' house in 1835, while that of the applicant was constructed in 1886; that the applicant's property has no way of access to the court in dispute so that, upon complaint by the residents of the opponents' house, in order to gather up garbage thrown from the applicant's premises into the said court, the applicant's tenants ask permission to enter the court by passing through the only existing door and which was cut in the opponents' wall, for there was no door in the applicant's building that gave entrance to the lot in question, although one of the applicant's attorneys in fact testified that, before the construction of the present water-closet, there was a door which communicated with the court, but this allegation was denied by the opponents' attorney.<br\/><br\/>At this stage of the proceedings the judge observed that the stone wall closing the line F N of the plan was not of ancient construction and was erected for the water-closet built by the applicant, with the permission of the municipality, to whom the land belonged, according to the applicant's counsel. It was also ascertained that, according to the opponents' expert,.mention was made in the opponent's documents of two chamfers, which constitute the true boundary of the property; that the awnings placed against the applicant's house for the protection of its windows, extended over the lot in question; that various timbers which served as supports for the uprights of the applicant's building, were observable at the surface of the ground in the said court and occupied more than half of its width; that the said water-closet, constructed by the applicant, was comprised within the points N, F, R S, approximately, and this was agreed to by the parties, and that on the line B C of the applicant's plan there was a building which had an <i>azotea <\/i>and three windows in the lower story and three in. the second.<br\/><br\/>The court, in view of the evidence adduced in this case and of the allegations advanced by both parties thereto, rendered judgment on December 27,1909, and found that the disputed piece of land was an integral part of the applicant's lot, denied the adverse claim filed by Vicente Gonzalez and decreed that, after a\u00a0 general default had been entered, the said property should be awarded to and registered in the name of Luis Perez y Samanillo, and ordered that the register of titles of this city of Manila should make a record of the fact that the property inscribed under No. 361, with respect to ownership, on page 30, back, of volume 8 of the registry of the district of Binondo, No. 23 of the archives, third inscription, had been awarded to the said Luis Perez y Samanillo, in case No. 4548, pursuant to Act No. 496.<br\/><br\/>From this judgment the opponent appealed and moved for a new trial. His motion was denied, and he likewise took an appeal from this ruling and, the proper bill of exceptions having been filed, the same was certified and forwarded to the clerk of this office.<br\/><br\/>The subject of controversy between the parties to this suit is the ownership of a small piece of land lying between two properties owned by them, respectively, and near the Sibacon <i>estero,<\/i> district of Santa Cruz.<br\/><br\/>In order to decide the question as to who is the owner of the disputed lot, it becomes necessary, in the first place, to examine the titles of the owners of each one of the adjoining properties, and to bear in mind that the block of five houses which belongs to the applicant now occupies two adjacent lots that formerly belonged to different owners; that prior to the acquisition of these lots by the now deceased Manuel Perez, the predecessor in interest of the applicant, there existed on each of them a house of rough masonry with stone walls, which houses were destroyed by fire; and that the lot in litigation borders, the greater part of it, the land nearest to the said Sibacon <i>estero.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The lot which, before the fire, was occupied by the house No. 37 of Calle Escolta, was sold, according to a public instrument dated January 13, 1886, by Felipe Govantes and Matias Saenz de Vizmanos, the latter as the attorney in fact of Manuel de Azcarraga, to Manuel Perez Marqueti, for 46,481.56 pesos, at the rate of 35 pesos, 3 <i>centimos<\/i>, and one <i>octavo<\/i> per meter of the 1,326.86 square meters which the said lot was found to contain, in accordance with a new survey made for the purpose, for the reason that the rough sketch thereof exhibited at the sale of the land at public auction showed the same to comprise a larger number of square meters, as stated in the said instrument.<br\/><br\/>The other lot situated alongside the Sibacon <i>estero<\/i>, which, before the fire, was occupied by the house No. 39 of the same street, Escolta, was purchased, with its walls and stone pavement unconsumed by the fire, by the same party above mentioned, Manuel Perez Marqueti, from the attorney in fact of Eduardo Antonio Keller, for 23,404.07 pesos, as shown by a public instrument dated March 9, 1886, at the rate of 31 pesos for each square meter of its area, 754.97 square meters, with the walls, according to the plan drawn by the engineers, Barlow and Wilson, on July 5, 1882, and the certificate issued by the architect, Antonio Ulloa.<br\/><br\/>The total area of these two lots, adjacent to each other, on which the purchaser Perez erected his five united buildings, aggregate 2,081.81 square meters, although the plan, accompanied by the technical description, attached to the application addressed to the Court of Land Registration, states that the area of the lot now occupied by the applicant's buildings is 2,124.43 square meters, showing an excess of 42.62 square meters over and above the number given in the deeds of both lots.<br\/><br\/>It is to be noted that, as both properties were purchased at auction at the rate of so much per square meter, the presumption is, and there is no proof to the contrary, that the purchaser exercised all due care and diligence (as it must be supposed that he did in order to avoid his paying more than he should) to fix and determine the exact number of square meters for which he had to pay in accordance with the respective selling prices since, in the natural order of things, it is not to be presumed that he was sufficiently careless in this matter to expose himself to have to pay for a greater number of square meters than the land actually contained.<br\/><br\/>Another circumstance which must be kept in mind is the respective ages of each of the buildings erected on the three adjoining lots, in the middle of which, toward the Sibacon <i>estero<\/i>, is located the lot in litigation. Among the titles exhibited by the applicant, mention is made in the instrument dated January 26,1858, of the house of rough masonry, No. 34, afterwards 37, Escolta, as being already in existence and as one of the pieces of realty included in the inheritance of the deceased Jose de Azcarraga (p. 46 of the record). With respect to the house No. 39, which stood beside the Sibacon<i> estero,<\/i> near the foot of the Santa Cruz Bridge, then called <i>de visita<\/i>, there was also exhibited by the applicant, among other titles, the instrument dated May 18,1832, in which it appears that this property, belonging to the estate of the deceased Manuela Lara, was sold at public auction to Manuel Zaragoza. As to the house at No. 28 Calle David, which is situated at the back of the applicant's property and now belongs to the opponent's wife, it appears that the same was acquired by, one of the opponent's predecessors in 1833 or 1834, according to the documents exhibited by the opponent (p. 128 of the record) and the affidavit of Maria Barbara Padilla, one of the predecessors of the opponent's wife. So that the three adjoining buildings already existed almost at the commencement of the nineteenth century, if not before, and two of them, Nos. 37 and 39, situated on the Escolta, disappeared as the result of the fire that occurred in October, 1885.<br\/><br\/>By an examination of the plan and technical description accompanying the application and of the description of the opponent's property given in his title inscribed in the registry of property, page 129, it is observed that, while the division line of the two properties consists of two straight lines with one short perpendicular line crossing them at their point of meeting, as shown in the said plan, in the aforesaid title this division appears as a broken line composed of five straight lines with two chamfers, the first line 19.95 meters long, the second line, the first chamfer, 4,50 meters long, the third 27.40 meters long, the fourth, the second chamfer, 2.60 meters long, and the fifth, 2.38 meters in length. From these two contradictory descriptions it is deduced that, if the applicant's plan is taken as correct, the space of land in litigation forms a part of his property, while to judge from the text of the opponent's title the said fractional lot is comprised within his title and can not be a part of the applicant's property. It is impossible that the division line of the two adjoining lots could he formed at the same time by two straight lines on one side and by five straight lines and two chamfers on the other.<br\/><br\/>When the applicant's building was erected in 1887, for many years, since before 1833, the opponent's building, with its stone wall and a door opening into the small disputed lot, had been in existence, and in the two titles of the two adjoining lots, on which the applicant's building was erected, no record appears of the form and configuration of the lots on the side adjacent to the opponent's property, while in the latter's title there is shown the configuration of his lot and the different forms in which thd same adjoins the two immediate lots, surrounded by their respective stone walls, before their sale to the applicant's father. From all of these facts it is concluded that the small lot in question belongs to the opponent and forms a part of the land on which his building is constructed, inasmuch as the detailed description of its boundaries coincides with the configuration of the said land on the side thereof which is adjacent to the applicant's lots, according to the plan in the trial record, and the wall of the said opponent's building, from the first central chamfer, runs in a straight line, parallel with the wall of the applicant's building, toward the <i>estero<\/i>, with the little disputed lot between them both; moreover, it does not appear that the said wall of the opponent had two chamfers and lay in five straight lines, assuming the configuration described in the applicant's^ plan and title; wherefore it is unquestionable that the said disputed lot is of the form described, on its side adjacent to the applicant's property.<br\/><br\/>The lots pertaining to each one of the said buildings, Nos. 37 and 39 of Calle Escolta, which were destroyed by the fire, must have been surrounded by a wall on their boundary line adjoining the lot of the building at No. 28 Calle David, whence it is that, in the instrument of sale, at least of the lot occupied by the building numbered 39 before the fire, mention is made of walls and stone pavement, an important detail, because the space of land in question, in nearly its entire length, adjoins this lot and does not appear to be included in the aforesaid instrument of sale (pp. 109 to 116 of the record), and therefore it must be found that the said disputed strip of land was not comprised in the sale made to Perez by Keller's representative, in March, 1886.<br\/><br\/>The opponent averred that the said disputed lot belonged to him and, since 1833 or 1834, had been in his possession and that of his wife and her predecessors, which was confirmed by one of the latter, Maria Barbara Padilla, who declared in an affidavit, that when her father, Narciso Padilla, acquired the building at No. 28 Calle David in the year mentioned, the strip of land in dispute formed a part of the lot on which the said building stood, and that the disputed land was used and enjoyed ever afterwards by her father and herself, without any opposition on the part of the owners of the two adjoining properties. This witness added that when she first began to live in the said building she was 7 years of age; that, to provide a means of entrance to the land in controversy, a doorway, which still existed, had been opened through the wall of the said building, No. 28, the eaves of the roof of which shed water onto the said lot, where her father and her family were accustomed to store lumber and other things and where they kept hogs and other animals; that there was also a window with a projecting iron grating in the upper story of the building and which overlooked the lot in litigation without objection or complaint by anybody.<br\/><br\/>The existence of the said door, which allowed entrance to the little lot from the opponent's house, appears to be confirmed by the testimony of Jose M.a Arriola, the applicant's attorney in fact, and of Otto Mur, the manager of the firm of Sprungli &amp; Co., the tenants of the opponent's building, and by the evidence obtained during the ocular inspection held by the court on the said small lot and on the adjoining properties. Moreover, the said Arriola testified that, when the water-closet was built on the end of the disputed strip of land, toward the <i>estero,<\/i> the inclosing partition was constructed on the side away from the <i>estero,<\/i> and on a diagonal line, for the purpose of respecting the said door opened in the wall of the opponent's building, a detail confirmed by the proceedings of inspection.<br\/><br\/>The petitioner Perez having erected his building in 1887, if he were the owner of the strip of land in question, he would, at least, have constructed his walls on the part of this strip on which the water from the eaves of the opponent's house did not fall; and if he did not do so, it was because he then believed that he should respect another's real property in the same manner that he did the door opened in the opponents' wall.<br\/><br\/>The small area of land in litigation is approximately 2 meters and some few centimeters in width, and the successive owners of the house No. 28 of Calle David and their tenants, have exercised acts of dominion over the said land, for the eaves of this house extend over it and shed the rain water thereupon, the iron grating of a window, opened in the upper story of the said house, projects half a meter over the said land and from this space receives light, and the said owners and tenants have been in the habit of entering upon the property by passing through the door before mentioned, for the purpose of enjoying the full and free use thereof, while no exit whatever existed from the applicant's building to the said strip of land, and if sometimes his tenants were obliged to enter the same they had to pass through the lot on which the opponent's house stands, after obtaining permission from the latter's tenants, and through the only door there which was opened in the wall of this house.<br\/><br\/>Article 582 of the Civil Code prescribes:<br\/><blockquote>\"Windows with direct views, or balconies or any similar openings projecting over the estate of the neighbor, can not be made if there is not a distance of, at least, two meters between the wall in which they are built and said estate.<br\/><br\/>\"Neither can side nor oblique views be opened over said property, unless there is a distance of sixty centimeters.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Article 586 of the same code also provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The owner of a building is obliged to construct his roofs or coverings in such a manner that rain water may fall on his own land or on the street or public place, and not on the land of his neighbor. Even if it falls on his own land, the owner is obliged to collect it in such manner that it will not injure the adjoining estate.\"<\/blockquote>Had the applicant or some of his remote predecessors owned the strip of land in question, they would not have consented to the opponents' house, No. 28, being constructed with a roof and window grating projecting or extending over their property, nor would they have permitted the rain water from such a roof to fall onto it to the detriment of their rights and interests, which are protected by the civil law, both ancient and modern, in accordance with the preinserted articles of the code.<br\/><br\/>If for more than seventy-five years, up to the date of the commencement of this suit, the opponents' building has been maintained with the said projections and entrance door to the land in question without objection or complaint on the part of the successive owners of the two adjacent properties, it is because the said strip of land forms an integral part of the opponents' property and never belonged to the applicant's predecessors, and the trial record shows not even circumstantial evidence that the applicant or his predecessors ever were in possession of or exercised any acts of ownership over the said strip of land.<br\/><br\/>That the opponent or his predecessors may have been careless and negligent in consenting to the performance, \"with respect to the lot in question, of acts and works productive of easements, does not prove that the said opponent was not the legitimate owner of the said lot; and though it be true that there is a discrepancy between the total measurement of the lot on which the opponent's said building, No. 28, stands, as recorded in the entry made in the registry and that expressed in the plan presented by the same opponent in the <i>Administracion,<\/i> together with a sworn statement, for the purpose of taxation, such discrepancy may be the subject of administrative action, but does not favor the applicant's claim nor prove that the land in litigation belongs to him, for, between the plan and technical description of the land occupied by the applicant's five buildings, and the registry memorandum of the latter inserted in the report of the register of deeds (p. 7 of the record), together with the description of the property set forth in the instrument (p. 17 of the record), executed by Agustina Samanillo, a notable discrepancy is also observed in the measurement of the land on which the said buildings are erected - 2,124.43 square meters according to the plan, and 2,076.29 square meters according to the documents mentioned.<br\/><br\/>The recent act of the applicant's representative in having opened a door affording entrance from his property to the fractional lot in question, as appears by the written notice given to this court by the opponent on the 28th of July of this year, does not affect the reasoning herein set forth, but, on the contrary, confirms the conclusion that the said lot does not belong to the applicant, but is the property of the opponent.<br\/><br\/>With the exclusion of the aforesaid small lot, the sole subject of the present litigation and of the opponent's claim, the applicant's property may of course be registered in the registry of property, but without the fractional lot before mentioned, in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 496 and in the manner therein prescribed; and the plan of the land occupied by the buildings, together with the technical description, must be rectified by excluding therefrom the said fractional lot which belongs to the opponent.<br\/><br\/>The opponent, on praying that his said small lot be excluded from the registry of the applicant's property, did not in turn apply for its registration in the property registry, wherefore it is unnecessary to determine in this case the different kinds of easements which encumber the said disputed lot, in favor of the applicant's property, inasmuch as, pursuant to section 40 of Act No. 496, there must be set forth in the decree of registration only the easements and other encumbrances to which the owner's estate is subject, and not those existing in favor of the same and which encumber the adjacent property, for the said section contains, among other provisions, the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"* * *, and also, in such manner as to show their relative priority, all particular estates, mortgages, easements, liens, attachments, and other incumbrances, including rights of husband or wife, if any, to which the land or owner's estate is subject,\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>For the foregoing reasons, it is proper, in our opinion, to affirm the judgment appealed from, as we hereby do, but with the express exclusion of the fractional lot in litigation, which has been found to be the property of the opponent, Vicente Gonzalez. The property of the applicant, Luis Perez y Samanillo, shall be entered in the registry of the Court of Land Registration in accordance with and in the manner provided by law, after a rectification of his plan, and without prejudice to any rights of easement which may encumber the small excluded lot in favor of the registered property. No special finding is made as to costs. So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Johnson, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Gaz. (No. 4), 128, December 24, 1909 [14 Phil., 681].<\/p><p>No brief was filed for defendant in error.<\/p><p>Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court :<\/p><p>This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands to review a judgment affirming a judgment of the court of the first instance in favor of the defendant.<\/p><p>The action was to recover indemnification of damages for the destruction of a storehouse and a stock of merchandise therein, valued at $58,473.49, Mexican, which the complaint alleged was \"burned maliciously or unlawfully by Eduardo Abaroa,\" the defendant to the complaint, and defendant in error here.<\/p><p>The defense was, first a general denial, and second, that the defendant, in a criminal action for the same burning and damage alleged, had been acquitted and held not guilty of the malicious burning now alleged, and in consequence of such judgment was not liable in a civil action for any damage to the plaintiff. The judgment in the criminal proceeding referred to was in these words: <br\/><\/p><blockquote><p>\"The evidence introduced by the prosecution indicates that the defendant might have been the author of the crime, but it is not conclusive. All persons charged with crime are presumed to be innocent until they are proven otherwise. There being in my mind some doubt as to the guilt of the defendant, I should and do hereby acquit him, with the costs of these proceedings <em>de officio<\/em>, and the attachment heretofore levied on his property is hereby vacated, reserving to the complaining witness whatever right he may have to bring a civil action against the said Eduardo Abaroa.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Upon a final hearing upon all of the proofs, the court of first instance adjudged that the cause of action alleged and proved was one arising from the criminal act which was the subject of the former criminal proceeding; and that the defendant, having been acquitted in the criminal action, was not civilly liable. This judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands upon an elaborate opinion.<\/p><p>We have not had the benefit of either brief or argument for the defendant in this writ of error, but have found much assistance in the opinions of each of the Philippine courts, as well from very helpful briefs filed by learned counsel for the plaintiffs in error. The contention which has been very forcibly pressed is that the judgment of acquittal in the criminal action does not operate as a bar to a subsequent civil action for indemnification of damages resulting from the same malicious or unlawful burning of the house and goods of the plaintiff, Which was charged in the criminal action.<\/p><p>The proposition upon which the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands grounded its judgment affirming that of the lower court in favor of the defendant Abaroa was, \"that it has not been alleged or shown by the plaintiffs, as a cause of action instituted civilly against the defendant, that the aforesaid fire was caused through any fault or negligence on the part of the defendant, nor is there shown any motive or cause distinct from that, the subject of the case already terminated in accordance with the provisions of articles 1093, 1902, and 1903 of the Civil Code; and second, that one who is not criminally responsible for a crime or misdemeanor cannot be made civilly responsible for the crime of which he has been acquitted.\"<\/p><p>The general rule of the common law is that a judgment in a criminal proceeding cannot be read in evidence in a civil action to establish any fact there determined. The reason for this rule is, primarily, that the parties are not the same, and, secondarily, that different rules of evidence are applicable. In the old case of Jones <em>v.<\/em> White, 1 Strange, 67, 68, Eyre, J., said: \"If a verdict be given in evidence, it must be between the same parties; and therefore an indictment, which is at the suit of the King, cannot be read in an action which is at the suit of the party.\" The requisite of mutual estoppel is essential to make a judgment in one action obligatory in another, although the point in issue is the same in each case. Unless the parties are the same, the matter is <em>res inter olios<\/em>. Buller, N. P., 233. 1 Wharton, Ev. sec, 776; Dyer County <em>v.<\/em> Chesapeake, O. &amp; S. W. R. Co., 87 Tenn., 712, 11 S. W., 943.<\/p><p>Neither will identity of parties always operate to make a judgment in a criminal action admissible in evidence in a civil action. There must be identity \"of issue. Thus, in Stone <em>v.<\/em> United States, 167 U. S., 178, 187; 42 L. ed., 127, 131; 17 Sup. Ct. Rep., 778, Stone was sued by the United States to recover the value of timber alleged to have been cut by him from public lands. He had been theretofore indicted, tried, and acquitted for unlawfully cutting the same timber from the public lands, and pleaded this judgment as a bar to a suit for civil liability. This was held to be no defense, and Coffey <em>v.<\/em> United States, 116 U. S., 436, 29 L. ed., 684; 6 Sup. Ct. Rep., 437, distinguished as having been placed upon the ground \"That the facts ascertained in the criminal case, as between the United States and the claimant, could not be 'again litigated between them, as the basis of any <em>statutory punishment <\/em>denounced as a consequence of the existence of the facts.' \" With respect to the application of Coffey's case, Mr. Justice Harlan, for the court, said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"In the present case the action against Stone is purely civil. It depends entirely upon the ownership of certain personal property. The rule established in Coffey's case can have no application in a civil case not involving any question of criminal intent or of forfeiture for prohibited acts, but turning wholly upon an issue as to the ownership of property. In the criminal case, the Government sought to punish a criminal offense, while in the civil case it only seeks, in its capacity as owners of property illegally converted, to recover its value. In the criminal case his acquittal may have been due to the fact that the Government failed to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of some fact essential to establish the offense charged, while the same evidence in a civil action brought to recover the value of the property illegally converted might have been sufficient to entitle the Government to a verdict. Not only was a greater degree of proof requisite to support the indictment than is sufficient to sustain a civil action, but an essential fact had to be proved in the criminal case, which was not necessary to be proved in the present suit. In order to convict the defendant upon the indictment for unlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously cutting and removing timber from lands of the. United States, it was necessary to prove a criminal, intent on his part, or, at least, that he knew the timber to be the property of the United States. R. <em>v.<\/em> Cohen, 8 Cox, C. C, 41; R. <em>v.<\/em> James 8 Car. &amp; P., 131; United States <em>v.<\/em> Pearce, 2 McLean, 14, Fed. Cas. No. 16020; Cutter <em>v.<\/em> States, 36 N. J. L., 125, 126. But the present action for the conversion of the timber would be supported by proof that it was in fact the property of the United States, whether the defendant knew that fact or not. E. E. Bolles Woodenware Co. <em>v.<\/em> United States, 106 U. S., 432; 27 L. ed., 230; 1 Sup. Ct. Rep., 398. An honest mistake of the defendant as to his title in the property would be a defense to the indictment, but not to the civil action. Broom's legal Maxims, 5th ed., 366, 367. It cannot be said that any fact was conclusively established in the criminal case, except that the defendant was not guilty of the public offense with which he was charged. We cannot agree that the failure or inability of the United States to prove in the criminal case that the defendant had been guilty of a crime either forfeited its right of property in the timber or its right in this civil action, upon a preponderance of proof, to recover the value of such property.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>There are peculiarities about the character of the action now under consideration which, as will appear later, may bring it under the principles of Coffey <em>v.<\/em> United States, supra, rather than Stone <em>v.<\/em> United States, the indemnification here sought being a part of the punishment attached to the offense of which the defendants has been acquitted.<\/p><p>The case is, however, one which we conceive must be governed by the local law of the Philippine Islands, and the single question to which we need address ourselves is as to whether that law was rightly applied by the local tribunals.<\/p><p>Article 1902 of the Civil Code in force in the Philippine Islands reads thus: \"A person who, by an act or omission, causes damage to another when there is fault or negligence, shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\" By articles 1092 and 1093 of the same Code provision is made for the enforcement of civil liability, varying in character according to the origin of the liability. Thus, article 1092 provides that civil obligations arising from crimes and misdemeanors shall be governed by the provisions of the Penal Code. On the other hand, article 1093 provides that \"those arising from acts or omissions, in which fault or negligence, not punished by law, occurs, shall be subject to the provisions of chapter second of title sixteen of this book.\" The action here involved comes directly under article 1092, above set out, and is not an action arising from \"fault or negligence, not punished by law.\" The complaint alleges that the act of burning was \"malicious and unlawful,\" and not that it was the result of any \"fault or negligence.\" This was the construction placed upon the complaint by both the courts below, and is a construction not challenged here. It follows that we must turn to the Penal Code to discover when a civil action arises out of a crime or misdemeanor, and the procedure of the enforcement of such civil liability. Article 17 of the Penal Code reads as follows: \"Every person criminally liable for a crime or misdemeanor is also civilly liable.\" May this civil liability be enforced without a prior legal determination of the fact of the defendant's guilt of crime? Does civil liability exist at all if the defendants has been found not guilty of the acts out of which the civil liability arises? The opinion of the court below was that a judgment of conviction was essential to an action for indemnification under the applicable local law. To this conclusion we assent, upon the following considerations:<\/p><p>First, by the positive legislation of the Philippine Codes, civil and criminal, a distinction is drawn between a civil liability which results from the mere negligence of the defendant and a liability for the civil consequences of a crime by which another has sustained loss or injury.<\/p><p>Second, the plain inference from article 17, above set out, is that civil liability spring out of and is dependent upon facts which, if true, would constitute a crime or misdemeanor.<\/p><p>Third, the Philippine Code of Procedure plainly contemplates that the civil liability of the defendant shall be ascertained and declared in the criminal proceedings.<\/p><p> Thus, section 742 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, after requiring that, in a criminal proceeding, all of the minor or incidental offenses included in the principal crime shall be decided, adds: \"All questions relating to the civil liability which may have been the subject-matter of the charge shall be decided in the sentence.\"<\/p><p>By article 108 of the same Code the prosecuting official is required to prosecute the right of the injured person to restitution or indemnity, unless such person renounces the right.<\/p><p>By article 112 of the same Code the civil action is held to be part of the criminal action, \"unless the person prejudiced or injured renounces the same, or expressly reserves the right to institute it after the conclusion of the criminal action.\"<\/p><p>In United States <em>v.<\/em> Catequista (1 Philippine, 537, 538), the court below failed to determine the liability of the defendant to indemnify the person injured by the misdemeanor of which he had been convicted. Concerning this, Ladd, J., for the court, said:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The court also erred in not determining in the judgment the civil liability of the defendant for the danos and perjuicios, which resulted from the criminal act. Such civil liability is a necessary consequence of criminal responsibility. (Penal Code, art. 17), and is to be declared and enforced in the criminal proceeding, except where the injured party reserves his right to avail himself of it in a distinct civil action. Code of Criminal Procedure of Spain, article 112, provisional law for the application of the Penal Code in the Philippines, article 51, No. 4. No such waiver or reservation is disclosed by the record here.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>It is true that one of the plaintiffs in the present case reserved whatever right he may have had to bring a civil action. This was obviously of no avail, inasmuch as there resulted a judgment for the defendant, and the plain inference from the foregoing is that a verdict of acquittal must carry with it exemption from civil responsibility.<\/p><p> The effect of the application of the substantive law of the Philippine Islands, given by the court below, not only in the present case, but in the prior cases cited above, accords with the interpretation of identical provisions in the law of Spain by the Supreme Court of that kingdom, as shown by citations from the Spanish Supreme Court Reports. Some of these we have not been able to verify. We have, however, examined the decision of that court cited as of January 3, 1877. In that case the defendant had been tried and acquitted upon a criminal complaint. Notwithstanding this result, the trial court gave a judgment indemnifying the injured person for a loss supposed to have been suffered by him as a consequence of the crime of which the defendant had been acquitted. This judgment was annulled. Upon this point the court, in substance, said that indemnity for damages in penal cases was a consequence of the commission of a crime. The defendant was therefore not liable civilly, inasmuch as he had been found not liable criminally.<\/p><p>The foregoing considerations eliminate any question of the effect of such a judgment of acquittal under the principles of the common law and require an affirmance of the judgment of the court below as properly based upon the applicable substantive law of the Philippine Islands, which has not been superseded by legislation since the establishment of the present Philippine Government.<\/p><p>Judgment affirmed.<br\/>\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><\/p><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1] <\/sup>218 U.

in consequence thereof, the forfeiture or seizure of the said P20,600 was decreed, in accordance with the provisions\u00a0 of said\u00a0 Act No. 1411; it was thereupon directed that an order be immediately\u00a0 issued and that the\u00a0 money\u00a0 be retained subject thereto until the matter was finally disposed of;

several documents connected with the testimony of said witnesses were presented, and even though a part of the evidence was objected to\u00a0 as\u00a0 immaterial by the\u00a0 representative of\u00a0 the plaintiff, the first and main question to\u00a0 be resolved\u00a0 in this case is whether or not this Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to\u00a0 try\u00a0 and to decide the matter on its merits, that is, whether it should consider the result of the evidence in order to render judgment, or, whether the court should limit its action to\u00a0 a review and to a decision\u00a0 upon the regularity of the proceedings before the Insular Collector of Customs, for the purpose of\u00a0 confirming the decision entered by him ordering the confiscation of the 20,600 pesos because of the violation of Act No. 1411, as pretended by counsel for the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>\"Section 1\u00a0 of said Act prohibits the exportation from the Philippine\u00a0 Islands\u00a0 of Philippine silver coins, coined by authority of\u00a0 the Act of Congress approved March 2,\u00a0 1903, or of bullion\u00a0 made by melting such coins, and provides that any of the aforementioned silver coins or bullion exported, or the exportation of which is attempted, subsequent to the passage of said Act, which was enacted on November 12, 1905, shall be liable to forfeiture by due process of law.<br\/><br\/>\"Section 2 of the same Act declares that the exportation or the attempt to export Philippine\u00a0 silver coins or bullion made from such coins is a criminal offense and fixes\u00a0 the penalty with which, in addition to the forfeiture, said crime shall be punished.<br\/><br\/>\"Section\u00a0 3 thereof directs\u00a0 that the provisions of section 1 of said Act shall be enforced by the collectors of customs for the Philippine Islands, in accordance with the provisions of Acts Nos. 355 as amended, 864 as amended, and 1405.<br\/><br\/>\"As\u00a0 may be seen from section 3 of said Act No. 1411, collectors of customs for the Islands are authorized to try and to decide matters in connection with the violation of section 1 of said Act, and to declare or make rulings with respect to the forfeiture of the silver coins or bullion made from such coins, that may be exported\u00a0 or attempted to be exported\u00a0 from the Islands,\u00a0 following the procedure mentioned in said section 3, to wit, such as\u00a0 prescribed by Acts Nos. 355, 864, and 1405 cited therein.<br\/><br\/>\"In these laws, the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance - the court that succeeded the now abolished Court of Customs Appeals - over the\u00a0 proceedings of the Collector of Customs is clearly shown.\u00a0\u00a0 In proper cases the latter files with the court a record of the proceedings, together with\u00a0 a petition relating the facts, asking, under section 313 of Act No. 355, as amended by section 5 of Act No. 864, the judgment of the court upon the issue of fine or penalty, or confiscation or forfeiture.\u00a0 The said\u00a0 section\u00a0 toward the end reads: 'The judgment of the court in such proceedings shall be limited to one in rem against the property seized.'<br\/><br\/>\"Nothing contained in the\u00a0 said laws authorizes the Court of\u00a0 First Instance to hold a new\u00a0 trial, or to\u00a0 admit\u00a0 new evidence in connection with\u00a0 the facts determined and decided upon by the Collector of Customs,\u00a0 in order to render judgment in view of the result thereof, and by the provision in section 313 that the judgment of the\u00a0 court in such proceedings shall be limited to one against the property seized, it must be clearly understood that it is not the duty of the court to make any declaration of rights\u00a0 in the matter\u00a0 submitted to it, but merely to decide with regard to the confiscation or forfeiture ordered by the Collector of Customs, either affirming or reversing it in view of the procedure followed before the Collector.<br\/><br\/>\"It appears in the present case that, after the confiscation of the P20,600 found in\u00a0 the possession of Ling\u00a0 Su Fan on the steamer <i>Taming <\/i>at the moment the steamer was about to sail for the port of Hongkong, apart from the criminal proceeding brought against Ling Su Fan for the punishment of the crime defined by section 2 of Act No. 1411, the Insular Collector of Customs took action in accordance with the provisions of law heretofore mentioned; that the matter was investigated and tried before said officer\u00a0 after the defendant Ling Su Fan, in whose possession the money was found, had been duly notified; that\u00a0 at the trial\u00a0 evidence was adduced by the defendant and,\u00a0 by stipulation of the parties, the proofs in the aforesaid criminal case were taken into account, and the allegations\u00a0 made by Ling Su Fan to the effect that the money did not belong to him but to Wong Tai of Hongkong, and was imported from said port to these Islands on the steamer <i>Taming<\/i>, were also considered; that in view\u00a0 of all of said allegations and of\u00a0 the\u00a0 evidence adduced\u00a0 the Insular Collector of Customs entered his decision ordering that said money be confiscated, and to this effect issued the\u00a0 order providing\u00a0 that the money be\u00a0 retained until the matter was\u00a0 finally\u00a0 settled; and, finally, it also appears\u00a0 that, notwithstanding the fact\u00a0 that the defendant was notified he\u00a0 has\u00a0 interposed\u00a0 no\u00a0 appeal\u00a0 whatever,\u00a0 for which\u00a0 reason, taking into account the regularity observed in the\u00a0 proceedings had before\u00a0 the Insular Collector of Customs, and\u00a0 the fact that the decision\u00a0 rendered by him has now become final, nothing remains\u00a0 to\u00a0 be done except\u00a0 to affirm the decision.<br\/><br\/>\"Against such affirmation\u00a0 can\u00a0 not now be pleaded the fact that the\u00a0 defendant Ling Su Fan, as shown by the evidence, on being notified on\u00a0 December 20,\u00a0 1906, that the trial would take place on the 22d\u00a0 of said month before the Insular Collector of Customs, and that he should appear and present his\u00a0 proofs, was\u00a0 informed that the P20,600 found in his possession on board\u00a0 the\u00a0 steamer <i>Taming<\/i> had been seized or confiscated on account of an\u00a0 alleged violation of Act No.\u00a0 1042\u00a0 of the Philippine Commission, as stated in Exhibit 10, and not of Act No. 1411 as appears in Exhibit A attached to the complaint, because, although a mistake were made in the notice giving the defendant to understand that he was charged with a violation of Act No. 1042, which prohibits the importation of Mexican currency, instead of Act No,\u00a0 1411 which prohibits and punishes the exportation of Philippine coins, such defect was cured by the defendant's own act in consenting to said error by\u00a0 admitting that he was informed of the true meaning thereof when he appeared before the Collector of Customs at the trial, adducing evidence thereat, and stipulating for the admission therein of the evidence taken in the criminal case in which he\u00a0 was charged\u00a0 with the violation of Act No.\u00a0 1411, and finally by admitting, through his own\u00a0 acts,\u00a0 that\u00a0 the charge made against him before the said\u00a0 Collector of Customs was for the\u00a0 violation of Act No. 1411\u00a0 inasmuch\u00a0 as,\u00a0 in answer thereto, said proofs were made and presented; finally, he has waived all claims on account of such defect by not interposing\u00a0 any\u00a0 appeal whatever from\u00a0 the decision\u00a0 of the said Collector of Customs.<br\/><br\/>\"Although in Exhibit A the number of the Act referred to in said notification appears to have been changed, the figures 1411 being placed over those which must\u00a0 have previously appeared in the document, the explanation given by counsel for the plaintiff as to how and why the alteration must have been made, and as to why, in the notification marked 'Exhibit 10' and offered in\u00a0 evidence by counsel for the defendant,\u00a0 No. 1042 appears and\u00a0 not No. 1411 as in said Exhibit A, shows that it must have all\u00a0 been due to a mistake which, according to the said counsel, an endeavor was1 made to correct in due course,\u00a0 that is, before the trial by the Collector of Customs; but be that as\u00a0 it may,\u00a0 and without prejudging the fact alleged by the counsel for the defendant, that\u00a0 the said\u00a0 document, Exhibit A, has\u00a0 been falsified,\u00a0 a fact\u00a0 which may be\u00a0 investigated if the representative of the defendant\u00a0 should insist upon it, it is evident that the error committed in said notice, Exhibit 10, although it constituted an irregularity in procedure, such irregularity has practically ceased to exist because of the defendant's own acts; and since he did not in any manner protest against it, it can not now be considered for the purpose of annulling the proceedings before the Insular Collector of Customs and the decision rendered by him.<br\/><br\/>\"However, the defendant has alleged in his answer that he had not attempted to export\u00a0 the\u00a0 said P20,600 outside of these Islands,\u00a0 but\u00a0 that, on\u00a0 the contrary,\u00a0 the money belonged\u00a0 to Wong\u00a0 Tai, a\u00a0 merchant of Hongkong, and was brought by him from said\u00a0 colony on the Taming\u00a0 for the purpose of exchanging the same\u00a0 for Spanish and Mexican silver coins; this allegation has already been\u00a0 made in the criminal proceedings\u00a0 brought\u00a0 against said defendant, and was considered in the judgment rendered therein, evidence having been adduced by the representative of said defendant in connection with these same facts\u00a0 and,\u00a0 by stipulation between the\u00a0 parties, proof submitted in the criminal case was also admitted as\u00a0 evidence in\u00a0 the\u00a0 present one.\u00a0 Lastly, the said Wong Tai has filed a\u00a0 motion to intervene in this action,\u00a0 alleging himself to be the owner of said money and asking that judgment be entered in his favor therefor, with legal interest thereon from the 11th of December, 1906; this motion was admitted by the lower court, notwithstanding the objection of the plaintiff's representative, because Wong Tai is an aider and\u00a0 abettor of the defendant and has a right to be heard in the proceedings.\u00a0 The result of said\u00a0 evidence therefore must be considered in this decision,\u00a0 for the purpose of also making\u00a0 the proper\u00a0 finding with respect to the decision entered\u00a0 in said\u00a0 case\u00a0 by the Collector of Customs.<br\/><br\/>\"As was said in the beginning hereof, the evidence taken in criminal cause No. 2947, brought before this court against Ling Su Fan wherein\u00a0 judgment was rendered\u00a0 by the\u00a0 Hon.

Crossfield of Part II of the same, constitutes a\u00a0 part of these proofs.\u00a0 The said judgment\u00a0 was affirmed\u00a0 by the Supreme Court on the\u00a0 10th of February of the present\u00a0 year and was published in the Official Gazette of the 4th of March following.\u00a0\u00a0 By reason of these said proofs the facts must be considered to have been proven that were so found by this court in its said judgment which reads as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"'That on the\u00a0 12th day of December, 1906,\u00a0 an employee at the Manila custom-house found on board the steamship <i> Taming<\/i> in the bunk occupied by and in the exclusive use and control of the defendant, who was the <i>comprador<\/i> on board\u00a0 (said ship), 20,600 silver coins each of 1 peso, being coin made and issued by and under the direction of the Government of the Philippine Islands; that when the said coins were discovered as aforesaid and the defendant was confronted with the fact, he stated at first that he\u00a0 knew nothing about it, and afterwards that they had been brought on board by different\u00a0 Filipinos whom\u00a0 he\u00a0 did\u00a0 not\u00a0 know and had\u00a0 been\u00a0 stored\u00a0 in\u00a0 the place in which they\u00a0 were found\u00a0 for\u00a0 transportation to Hongkong;\u00a0 that\u00a0 those\u00a0 statements\u00a0 were made by the defendant voluntarily; that the steamship\u00a0 <i>Taming,<\/i>\u00a0 on which\u00a0 these\u00a0 coins\u00a0 were found, had already been cleared\u00a0 from the port of Manila\u00a0 for Hongkong\u00a0 and\u00a0 that she was about ready to sail, and that the coins\u00a0 were not manifested either in the incoming or outgoing voyage\u00a0 of the said vessel; that the finding of the coins on board the said\u00a0 steamship <i>Taming,<\/i> as before state'd,\u00a0 was admitted\u00a0 by the defendant at the trial; that the bullion value\u00a0 of the said coins at the time they were alleged\u00a0 to\u00a0 have left Hongkong\u00a0 was\u00a0 at\u00a0 least 9\u00a0 per\u00a0 cent more\u00a0 than\u00a0 their apparent\u00a0 face\u00a0 value in\u00a0 the Philippine Islands.'<br\/><br\/>\"Concerning the said evidence\u00a0 the court said in the same judgment:<br\/><br\/>\" 'Evidence was offered on the part of the defense to the effect that\u00a0 the\u00a0 said money\u00a0 was\u00a0 owned by a Chinaman in Hongkong, who shipped the\u00a0 same to the Philippine Islands by the defendant, for the purpose of purchasing Mexican silver coins and Spanish-Filipino silver coins, in accordance with an agreement made by the defendant with another person in Manila, under which for 82\u00a0 Philippine pesos he was to receive 100 Spanish-Filipino pesos,\u00a0 and for 97 Philippine pesos he was to receive 100 pesos Mexican currency, and in corroboration of\u00a0 the\u00a0 shipment there was presented an\u00a0 insurance policy upon these coins, issued by an insurance company at Hongkong,\u00a0 The defendant testified that upon bringing the\u00a0 coins to Manila\u00a0 he\u00a0 ascertained that he\u00a0 could not\u00a0 purchase Mexican coins and\u00a0 Spanish-Filipino\u00a0 coins as advantageously\u00a0 as he had\u00a0 before agreed, and in accordance with his\u00a0 understanding with the owner of the Philippine silver coins, and so decided to take the Philippine coins back to Hongkong to the owner thereof.'<br\/><br\/>\"For the purpose of proving these facts, counsel for the plaintiff\u00a0 has offered the second part of the evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 This consists\u00a0 of the testimony given by Wong\u00a0 Tai in the same criminal\u00a0 case, the deposition of several witnesses taken in Hongkong, and the production of several documents in relation\u00a0 with their testimony, whereby it was attempted to show that\u00a0 Wong\u00a0 Tai\u00a0 had acquired in Hongkong from two Chinamen residing there, the 20,600 Philippine silver coins a few\u00a0 days prior to the sailing\u00a0 of the <i>Taming <\/i>from\u00a0 that port on\u00a0 the 4th day of December,\u00a0 1906; that Wong Tai himself insured the money in a Japanese company of said city and\u00a0 received from said company an\u00a0 insurance policy therefor, of which he delivered one copy\u00a0 to Ling Su\u00a0 Fan when\u00a0 he gave him\u00a0 the money to be exchanged here\u00a0 in Manila for Spanish-Filipino and\u00a0 Mexican coins as stated above,\u00a0 and that all of said sum was shipped\u00a0 on the steamship <i>Taming <\/i>in gunny bags before the steamer's departure from the\u00a0 port of Hongkong, on the 4th day of December.<br\/><br\/>\"In considering the value that\u00a0 should be attached to this testimony, and especially to that\u00a0 of those persons who testified in\u00a0 Hongkong,\u00a0 and in\u00a0 relation with said testimony to the\u00a0 documents produced together\u00a0 with said\u00a0 deposition, the following must be taken\u00a0 into\u00a0 account:<br\/><br\/>\"First. That when the money, was found by the customs secret\u00a0 agents\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 possession\u00a0 of\u00a0 Ling\u00a0 Su Fan on the afternoon of December 12, on board the steamship <i>Taming,<\/i> and upon the defendant being there and then examined as to the origin of the money, he said nothing regarding the policy of insurance, which according to\u00a0 him and to Wong Tai,\u00a0 was given him by the latter when the money was delivered to him in Hongkong; neither was the policy produced at the time, but\u00a0 only when\u00a0 he testified\u00a0 in\u00a0 the criminal proceedings on the 7th of January, 1907,\u00a0 to wit, twenty-five days after the seizure, in spite of the fact that he testified in said case that when\u00a0 the seizure was made he already had the policy in his possession.<br\/><br\/>\"Second. That after the seizure\u00a0 of the money, Ling Su Fan\u00a0 returned\u00a0 to Hongkong on the\u00a0 same steamer<i> Taming<\/i> and had an interview and conversation with Wong Tai concerning said matter,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the latter\u00a0 then told\u00a0 him to explain the matter of the policy, and show it to the authorities\u00a0 here.\u00a0 (Folio 47 of the testimony\u00a0 in\u00a0 the criminal cause.)<br\/><br\/>\"Third, That while Juan Ong King, the person who, according to Ling Su Fan,\u00a0 had\u00a0 agreed with him to exchange here\u00a0\u00a0 the\u00a0 Philippine\u00a0 coins\u00a0 brought from\u00a0 Hongkong for Spanish-Filipino and Mexican silver\u00a0 coins, testified that the exchange was not effected because he wanted 86\u00a0 pesos Conant for every 100 pesos of Spanish silver and 101 pesos Conant for every 100 pesos\u00a0 Mexican, Ling Su Fan mentioned only the former but not the\u00a0 latter, that\u00a0 is, of the exchange of 100 pesos Conant\u00a0 for 100 pesos Mexican, as the reason why the exchange was not made.\u00a0\u00a0 (Folios 25 and 33 of the testimony in said criminal case.)<br\/><br\/>\"Fourth. That the said Juan Ong King was unable to give the name or address of the Filipino\u00a0 who, according to him, was to furnish the Mexican and the Spanish coins in exchange for the Philippine\u00a0 currency in\u00a0 the possession of Ling Su\u00a0 Fan, notwithstanding that Ling Su Fan said Juan Ong\u00a0 King knew him well and that the Filipino frequently called on him to talk over the\u00a0 matter.<br\/><br\/>\"Fifth. That as already stated in the judgments of both the lower court and of the Supreme Court, the Philippine silver coins were worth in Hongkong,\u00a0 at the time\u00a0 when the money was seized on\u00a0 board the\u00a0 <i>Taming<\/i> - that\u00a0 is,\u00a0 at the period alleged by the defendant that it was shipped\u00a0 to this port - 9 per cent more\u00a0 as bullion than as currency.\u00a0\u00a0 It can not therefore be understood how\u00a0 Wong\u00a0 Tai\u00a0 preferred to ship them to this port to be\u00a0 exchanged for Spanish and Mexican coins, incurring the risk of transportation, besides having to insure them as he claims to have done and without the certainty of obtaining the profit which without trouble or risk he could have obtained in Hongkong.<br\/><br\/>\"Sixth. That it was not\u00a0 explained how and why, if according to the statement of Wong Tai the 20,600\u00a0 pesos were\u00a0 taken from the\u00a0 city\u00a0 of\u00a0 Hongkong to\u00a0 the steamer Taming in gunny bags and in the\u00a0 daytime, neither the captain, the officers, or the crew of said steamer became aware of it, and that the said bags of money which formed a large bulk\u00a0 were kept concealed\u00a0 in the bunk of the defendant,\u00a0 Ling\u00a0 Su Fan, without being\u00a0 discovered by the officers and crew of the steamer.\u00a0 The matter may\u00a0 be explained, on the contrary, as being more worthy of credit, that the money was introduced in several\u00a0 small packets of 50 pesos each, such as were found on board the Taming during the steamer's sojourn in Manila Bay after its arrival\u00a0 from Hongkong.<br\/><br\/>\"Seventh. That the testimony given in\u00a0 Hongkong by both the manager and the clerks\u00a0 of the insurance company that, according to Wong Tai, issued\u00a0 the policy of insurance on the money; the testimony\u00a0 of\u00a0 other Chinamen who\u00a0 have testified in favor of Wong Tai in the said colony\u00a0 of Hongkong ; the presentation of documents relating to the said insurance; and the alleged acquisition by Wong Tai\u00a0 in Hongkong\u00a0 of the 20,600 Philippine silver pesos took\u00a0 place on the\u00a0 26th and\u00a0 27th of March of this year - that is to say, one year and a few months after the\u00a0 facts had\u00a0 occurred, and after\u00a0 Wong Tai had alleged that he was the owner of the money - and that he had shipped here to Manila from Hongkong in charge\u00a0 of Ling Su\u00a0 Fan, in order to exchange it for Spanish and Mexican silver coins.\u00a0\u00a0 It is quite reasonable, in view of the period of time that has elapsed,\u00a0 to doubt the veracity of said statements and the truth and authenticity of such documents, above all if it is taken into account that they are not official, and\u00a0 can not be accorded more consideration than\u00a0 as mere\u00a0 private documents.<br\/><br\/>\"It can not therefore be considered proven that the said 20,600 pesos Philippine currency belonged\u00a0 to Wong Tai of Hongkong, nor that he had shipped them to these Islands by the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 Ling Su\u00a0 Fan in order\u00a0 to purchase or exchange them for Spanish\u00a0 or Mexican silver\u00a0 coins, and that, not having attained his object, the defendant was carrying them back to Hongkong when they were seized in his bunk on the steamship\u00a0 <i>Taming<\/i>.\u00a0 On\u00a0 the contrary, as\u00a0 the defendant,\u00a0 Ling\u00a0 Su Fan, was the holder of said money,\u00a0 it being in his possession\u00a0 at the time the seizure was made, and as the explanations\u00a0 he endeavored to make to induce the belief that the money was not his are not satisfactory nor have in any manner been\u00a0 proven he\u00a0 must be considered to be the owner thereof, not Wong Tai, whose intervention is for this reason contrary to law, and in any manner in which it may be shown,\u00a0 as it\u00a0 has\u00a0 been, that an attempt\u00a0 was made to export said\u00a0 coins, or, rather,\u00a0 that they were being exported from these Islands for\u00a0 Hongkong on the steamer Taming on the afternoon of\u00a0 December 12, 1906, in violation\u00a0 of the provisions\u00a0 of\u00a0 section\u00a0 1 of Act No.\u00a0 1411, the confiscation of the\u00a0 same\u00a0 was properly decreed by the Collector\u00a0 of Customs and the\u00a0 same should be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>\"It was finally alleged by counsel for the defendant that the said\u00a0 Act No. 1411 is null and void as being contrary to the provisions of paragraph 1,\u00a0 section 5, of\u00a0 the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, and to the fifth amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America.<br\/><br\/>\"In order to refute said allegation it is sufficient to cite the Supreme Court\u00a0 of these\u00a0 Islands, when dealing with the same\u00a0 question in\u00a0 the decision rendered on\u00a0 February 10 of the present year, in the aforesaid criminal case No. 2927 against Ling Su Fan for violation of the said Act.<br\/><br\/>\"In said decision,\u00a0 after stating that paragraph 1\u00a0 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, is almost exactly the same in its phraseology as\u00a0 a portion of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, it is further said:<br\/><br\/>\" 'Paragraph 1 of section 5 of the\u00a0 said Act of Congress is as follows:<br\/><br\/>\" ' \"That no law shall be\u00a0 enacted in\u00a0 said Islands\u00a0 which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without <i>due process of law,<\/i> or deny to any person therein the equal protection of the laws.\"<br\/><br\/>\" 'It will be noted that this amendment does not prohibit the\u00a0 enactment of laws\u00a0 by the legislative department\u00a0 of the Philippine Government depriving persons of life, liberty, or property.\u00a0 It simply provides that laws shall not be enacted which\u00a0 shall deprive persons of life, liberty, or property <i>without due process of law.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 The question, then, is presented, is the Act under which the defendant is prosecuted here, and under which it is sought to deprive him of the\u00a0 money which it is\u00a0 alleged he attempted to illegally export, in accordance with due process of law?<br\/><br\/>\" 'The Congress\u00a0 of the United States, on the 2d day of March,\u00a0 1903, passed an Act entitled\u00a0 \"An Act to establish a standard of value and to provide for a coinage system in the\u00a0 Philippine\u00a0 Islands.\"<br\/><br\/>\" 'Section 6 of said Act is\u00a0 as follows:<br\/><br\/>\" ' \"Sec. 6.

THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OP CUSTOMS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance\u00a0 which\u00a0 overruled\u00a0 a decision\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Insular Collector of Customs, requiring payment of duty upon certain packing cases, under Rule\u00a0 18 of the Tariff Revision\u00a0 Law of 1905.<br\/><br\/>The respondents, Walter E. Olsen &amp; Co., imported into the Philippine Islands certain manufactured tobacco, which was classified by the\u00a0 Collector\u00a0 of Customs at the\u00a0 port of Manila under paragraph 364 of\u00a0 the Tariff Law as \"Tobacco *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 (<i>b<\/i>) manufactured, net weight, kilo, one dollar.\"<br\/><br\/>The tobacco was packed in small cotton sacks, a numbe of which were inclosed in a sealed tin box.\u00a0 From four to six of these\u00a0 tin boxes were inclosed in a wooden box\u00a0 or packing case, which\u00a0 was securely fastened for shipment. The Collector of Customs\u00a0 included the\u00a0 weight\u00a0 of\u00a0 the tin boxes in the dutiable weight of the tobacco.\u00a0 Against this ruling the importers protested, on the ground \"that the tin casing in which the sacks of tobacco\u00a0 were inclosed should not be figured and included as net weight of the tobacco, but should be classified under its own weight; that the immediate\u00a0 receptacle of the tobacco is the sacks in which the tobacco is packed.\"\u00a0 In overruling this protest the Insular Collector of Customs said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The importation in question consists of certain smoking tobacco packed in small cotton sacks, a\u00a0 number of which constitute the contents of small tin boxes, there being several of these tin boxes packed in a wooden case.\u00a0 The importers' contention being that the dutiable\u00a0 weight should be that of the tobacco, together with the cotton sacks, and that the interior\u00a0 tin cases, as well as the\u00a0 wooden cases, should be considered as common\u00a0 exterior coverings.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 Rule 18 of the Tariff Revision Law of 1905 reads:\u00a0 'In all cases in which dutiable merchandise shall by its tariff number be dutiable\u00a0 upon net\u00a0 weight, the dutiable weight of such\u00a0 merchandise shall\u00a0 not include the weight of\u00a0 any\u00a0 common exterior\u00a0 cover\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 but shall\u00a0 include all\u00a0 interior\u00a0 or immediate receptacles.'\u00a0 This\u00a0 shipment\u00a0 of\u00a0 tobacco\u00a0 was packed in (1)\u00a0 a 'common\u00a0 exterior covering,'\u00a0 consisting of a\u00a0 wooden\u00a0 case; (2) 'interior\u00a0 receptacles,' consisting\u00a0 of several tin cases packed\u00a0 in\u00a0 the wooden\u00a0 case; and (3)\u00a0 in 'immediate receptacles,' consisting of cotton sacks.\u00a0 In the opinion of the\u00a0 undersigned, the wording\u00a0 of the law is too clear and explicit to permit a doubt as to the proper classification of any of the three kinds of receptacles mentioned. In the liquidation of the entry concerned the dutiable weight of the common\u00a0 exterior\u00a0 covering (the wooden packing case) was not included in the\u00a0 dutiable weight of the merchandise, but, following\u00a0 Rule 18,\u00a0 there was included therein 'all interior or immediate receptacles' (the\u00a0 tin\u00a0 cases and cotton sacks), which is deemed to be the\u00a0 proper classification indicated by said rule.\"<\/blockquote>From this decision\u00a0 an appeal was taken to the Court of First\u00a0 Instance, which reversed the ruling of the Collector. The court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Considering, then, that to the net weight of the tobacco the only thing which must be added to it\u00a0 under this rule for the purpose of determining its weight\u00a0 must be the\u00a0 interior or immediate receptacle, there can be but one interior or immediate receptacle, and every cover or receptacle which is added to the interior or immediate\u00a0 receptacle is an exterior cover.\u00a0 In this\u00a0 case the tobacco being\u00a0 contained in cloth sacks or bags, such\u00a0 cloth sacks or bags are the immediate interior receptacles, and\u00a0 if these are inclosed in tin cases the tin\u00a0 cases\u00a0 become an exterior receptacle, and if the tin cases are again inclosed\u00a0 in wooden cases or\u00a0 boxes, such wooden cases or\u00a0 boxes become an additional exterior covering,\u00a0 and\u00a0 all the\u00a0 exterior covers\u00a0 should\u00a0 be excluded from the net weight of the dutiable article.\u00a0 The Collector of Customs in his decision seems to have\u00a0 proceeded upon the reverse order, and, excluding the common exterior cover, finds all within\u00a0 it interior or immediate receptacles, and includes them in the weight of the article to determine\u00a0 its net weight.\u00a0 I am of the opinion\u00a0 that this is error from the very language of the\u00a0 rule, which says that 'the\u00a0 dutiable weight of\u00a0 such merchandise\u00a0 shall not include the weight of any exterior cover.' \"<\/blockquote>A statute, such as that of Rule 18, should be\u00a0 construed in a broad and liberal way.\u00a0 The particular sentence or phrase under consideration should be\u00a0 read in connection with other provisions\u00a0 of\u00a0 the statute of which\u00a0 it forms a part.\u00a0 The Act attempts\u00a0 to\u00a0 provide specific\u00a0 rules for the levying and adjusting of duties\u00a0 on\u00a0 packing,\u00a0 packages,\u00a0 and receptacles for dutiable goods.\u00a0 The general rule is first stated that \"common packing, packages, receptacles, and\u00a0 coverings of imported merchandise\u00a0 in use and imported with such merchandise shall be dutiable\u00a0 under\u00a0 their corresponding paragraphs of\u00a0 the tariff except in cases of goods dutiable\u00a0 by gross weight or ad valorem.\"\u00a0\u00a0 If the merchandise is dutiable upon the gross weight, the\u00a0 dutiable weight \"shall include the weight of all\u00a0 covers, receptacles, wrappers, packages, and packing of every description, whether exterior, interior,\u00a0 or immediate, without\u00a0 any allowance\u00a0 for\u00a0 tare.\" If the merchandise is\u00a0 dutiable upon the net weight, \"the dutiable weight of such merchandise shall not include the weight of any common exterior cover, receptacle, package, wrappers, or packing, but shall include all interior or immediate receptacles,\" that is, packing, receptacles and coverings\u00a0 shall pay duty\u00a0 as\u00a0 such under the proper\u00a0 paragraph of the law, except when the goods in the cover or receptacle are dutiable by gross weight or ad valorem, in which case the coverings and packings of every nature are included in the weight\u00a0 upon which\u00a0 the\u00a0 duty\u00a0 is estimated.\u00a0\u00a0 A distinction is made between exterior, interior\u00a0 and immediate receptacles, and it is evident that these words as here\u00a0 used are not synonymous.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 a recognition of the fact that the importer may pack\u00a0 his goods for\u00a0 shipment\u00a0 in\u00a0 such manner that there may\u00a0 be either\u00a0 exterior, interior, or immediate, as well as exterior or immediate receptacles.\u00a0 If the merchandise is dutiable\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the net weight, the\u00a0 dutiable weight shall not include any common exterior covering, receptacle, package, wrapper, or packing, but shall include all interior or immediate receptacles.<br\/><br\/>The articles under consideration were dutiable upon their net weight.\u00a0\u00a0 The law recognizes that they may be so packed that there will be exterior, interior and immediate receptacles.\u00a0 The shipper may pack his goods as his interest or convenience dictates.\u00a0\u00a0 The common exterior cover must be excluded,\u00a0 and the immediate receptacle must be included in the dutiable weight.\u00a0\u00a0 If\u00a0 the shipper thinks\u00a0 it to\u00a0 his advantage to inclose certain of the immediate receptacles in a receptacle common to them\u00a0 only,\u00a0 he may import them in that form, because the exterior cover is then the common cover of the immediate receptacles.\u00a0 If he chooses to make these\u00a0 packages\u00a0 into\u00a0 one large package with\u00a0 an exterior cover common\u00a0 to\u00a0 them all, what\u00a0 were originally common covers become interior receptacles of the immediate receptacles, with an exterior\u00a0 common cover of them\u00a0 all.\u00a0 Rule 18 then says that the net weight of the dutiable merchandise shall include all of these interior or immediate receptacles. This means all interior receptacles and all immediate receptacles.\u00a0 To construe the words \"interior\" and \"immediate\" as synonymous would be to render the phrase meaningless and to lose sight of the fact that the statute in the preceding paragraph clearly recognizes the difference between interior and immediate receptacles.\u00a0\u00a0 We therefore\u00a0 construe\u00a0 Rule 18 to mean that the exterior covering when common to all shall be excluded, and all other receptacles, whether interior or immediate,\u00a0 shall be included in the dutiable weight of the merchandise.<br\/><br\/>The court below held each tin box to be\u00a0 \"an additional exterior covering.\"\u00a0 There is no provision made in the law for \"additional exterior\" coverings.\u00a0 Provision is made only for a common\u00a0 exterior covering.\u00a0 We have in this case a large wooden box inclosing ten tin boxes,\u00a0 each tin box, in its turn, inclosing ten bags, of tobacco. In determining how many exterior\u00a0 coverings\u00a0 are contemplated by the law, we must take into consideration that Rule 18, to speak figuratively, is looking at the wooden box as a whole.\u00a0 This is necessarily so because it is the specific package upon which duty is to be levied\u00a0 that is to say, it\u00a0 is the unit of dutiability.\u00a0 If there were more than one such box, each one would, in the same way, be looked at separately.\u00a0 In other words, there would\u00a0 be as many\u00a0 separate applications of the rule as there are\u00a0 separate visible packages.\u00a0 If we look at each wooden box as\u00a0 a whole, as the unit of durability, it is evident, as a matter of language, that there is only one <i>common<\/i> exterior covering\u00a0 so far\u00a0 as that box and its contents\u00a0 are concerned.\u00a0 This must necessarily be so because there can not be a common exterior covering for two or more boxes which\u00a0 are entirely separated\u00a0 from\u00a0 each other, each one capable of being moved and transported independently of the other, and occupying\u00a0 entirely different and widely separated portions of uninclosed\u00a0 space.\u00a0 Two\u00a0 objects which are inclosed in a common covering are incapable of separation\u00a0 from each other farther than the limits of the common covering.\u00a0\u00a0 The instant that one of two objects inclosed in a common covering comes to occupy a portion of space not inclosed in the\u00a0 common receptacle, that instant the covering ceases to be common in its relation to those two objects.<br\/><br\/>It is apparent,\u00a0 therefore,\u00a0 that as to all of the tin boxes inclosed in\u00a0 the wooden covering there is but <i>one<\/i> common covering.\u00a0 To be sure, each tin box is, in a sense, a common covering as to the ten bags\u00a0 of tobacco contained in it, but <i>it is not common as to the other tin boxes within the same wooden\u00a0 covering. <\/i> When\u00a0 we say\u00a0 that each tin box is a common covering as to all the bags within it, we are. looking at<i> only\u00a0 a part of the shipment;<\/i> we are\u00a0 dividing the unit of dutiability.\u00a0 We are not looking\u00a0 at the\u00a0 shipment as a whole.\u00a0\u00a0 As we have before stated, a proper interpretation of Rule 18 requires that each box occupying a separate portion of un inclosed or theretofore unoccupied space must be looked at separately,\u00a0 each being a separate\u00a0 and distinct package to\u00a0 which the rule must be applied\u00a0 in levying the duty.\u00a0 The word \"common,\" by force of its definition, refers to all of the ten tin boxes.\u00a0 The words \"common exterior covering\" refer, for the same reason, to\u00a0 all of the ten tin boxes.\u00a0\u00a0 Under the facts of this\u00a0 case, there can be only one covering<i> common<\/i> to them\u00a0 all and there\u00a0 can\u00a0 be only one covering <i>exterior to them all.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The foregoing, it seems to us,\u00a0 disposes of that interpretation\u00a0 of the court below whereby each\u00a0 tin box is held to be \"an additional exterior covering.\"\u00a0\u00a0 From the very nature of things there can be,\u00a0 under the\u00a0 facts, but\u00a0 one\u00a0 exterior covering for everything within\u00a0 that covering.\u00a0\u00a0 The confusion arises,\u00a0 as before pointed out, from not\u00a0 looking at the wooden box or covering as a whole.\u00a0\u00a0 It is not permissible to look at the wooden box as ten separate tin boxes, for, if it be so regarded, then those provisions of Rule 18 relating to the <i>common exterior covering<\/i> and the <i>interior<\/i> receptacles\u00a0 have\u00a0 lost completely\u00a0 their significance.\u00a0 The\u00a0 rule, by the very nature\u00a0 of its terms, regards\u00a0 the\u00a0 wooden box as the entity\u00a0 upon which,\u00a0 or the contents of\u00a0 which, duty is to be\u00a0 levied; and the descriptions of the articles which are dutiable or not\u00a0 dutiable within said\u00a0 wooden covering refer\u00a0 for their\u00a0 significance\u00a0 and meaning to\u00a0 the wooden covering itself.\u00a0 The\u00a0 words \"interior\"\u00a0 and\u00a0 \"immediate\" have no meaning apart from that which is \"exterior\" to all.<br\/><br\/>It having been demonstrated that there is only <i>one<\/i> common exterior covering and that one the wooden box or case, it necessarily follows that the tin boxes in question can not be in\u00a0 any sense a\u00a0 common or exterior covering.\u00a0 Being neither common nor exterior,\u00a0 they must,\u00a0 then,\u00a0 be\u00a0 either interior or immediate.\u00a0\u00a0 In this case they can not be both. It is admitted by all that the cotton bags are the immediate coverings.\u00a0 The tin\u00a0 boxes can not, therefore, be immediate, as they\u00a0 and\u00a0 the cotton\u00a0 bags\u00a0 can not\u00a0 perform\u00a0 the same office at the same time.\u00a0 As a necessary result, the\u00a0 words \"interior\" and\u00a0 \"immediate\" can\u00a0 not\u00a0 have\u00a0 been meant by the statute to be synonymous.\u00a0 The words \"all\" and \" receptacles\" in the phrase \"all interior or immediate receptacles,\" both in the plural, strengthen\u00a0 this conclusion.\u00a0 The result thus reached\u00a0 avoids rendering meaningless the phrase in question and doing violence to the structure of the preceding paragraph of the statute.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of\u00a0 the court below is hereby reversed and the decision of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Insular Collector of Customs affirmed, without special finding as to costs of this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson,<\/i> and <i>Carson, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

RAMON HONTIVEROS CARMONA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">On the 25th of September, 1908, Ramon Hontiveros Carmona had a dispute with his mother-in-law, Potenciana Sales, on account of the latter's refusal to give him some money which he had asked of her, and the land tax receipt of a piece of property which he intended to mortgage. The defendant told his mother-in-law that she was a traitress and a conniver, as she permitted her daughter, Maria Fuentes, Hontivero's wife, to have unlawful relations with another man. On the 29th of the same month, Hontiveros told his mother-in-law that if she, of her own accord, would not leave him, he would leave her. On the night of October 3, 1908, Hontiveros, after a dispute which he had with his said mother-in-law, which arose through his jealousy of his wife, Maria Fuentes, assaulted the latter with a bolo, likewise his sisters-in-law, Eusebia and Isabel Fuentes, his aforesaid mother-in-law, Potenciana Sales, and the servant girl, Felipa Lacro. The wife, Maria, received a wound in the head and another in the left shoulder. Her nine-months-old child, which she was carrying at the time she was assaulted, was also slightly wounded in the forehead. Isabel Fuentes was wounded in the left jaw, as a result of which she was unable to work for a month. Eusebia Fuentes suffered a wound in the left forearm and elbow. The mother-in-law, Potenciana Sales, received a wound in the neck, and, finally, the servant girl, Felipa Lacro, had the lower lobe of the left ear cut in two, causing a visible deformity. Hontiveros inflicted these wounds without the least provocation on the part of the injured persons, and without any reason whatever. <p>The accused attacked his mother-in-law and sisters-in-law while they were eating supper; his wife, on her leaving a room of the house with a child in her arms, and the servant girl in the kitchen. The wound of Potenciana Sales, the defendant's mother-in-law, was cured in thirty days; that of Isabel Fuentes, a sister-in-law of the defendant, in thirty days; that of Eusebia Fuentes, also a sister-in-law of the defendant, in fifteen days, and that of the servant girl, who lost the lobe of her left ear, in forty-five days. The wounds of Maria Fuentes, the aggressor's wife, were cured in about sixty days, although the one in her head was poorly healed.<\/p> <p>By reason of the foregoing facts, and in view of the preliminary investigation made by the justice of the peace of Jamindan, the provincial fiscal, on October 15, 1908, filed an information with the Court of First Instance, charging Ramon Hontiveros Carmona with the crime of <em>lesiones graves,<\/em> and this action having been instituted, the judge, upon the evidence adduced, rendered judgment on the 18th of January, 1909, and sentenced the defendant, for the most serious crime of the several included in the information, to the penalty of eight months' <em>prision correccional,<\/em> to indemnify Felipa Lacro in the sum of P25, and, in case of insolvency, to subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs. From this judgment the defendant appealed.<\/p> <p>From the facts related, which were fully proved in the present cause, it is concluded that several crimes of <em>lesiones graves<\/em> and <em>menos graves,<\/em> provided for and punished by articles 416, Nos. 3 and 4, in relation with the paragraph immediately following this last number, and 418, of the Penal Code, were actually committed; and notwithstanding the fact that the complaint specified five punishable acts executed to the injury of an equal number of persons, withal it only charged the alleged perpetrator thereof with one crime of <em>lesiones graves,<\/em> which must be understood to be either for the wounds inflicted upon the defendant's wife, or for the one occasioned to the servant girl, both of which crimes are punished by the penalty of <em>prision correccional<\/em> in its minimum and medium degree, pursuant to the said No. 3, and the penultimate paragraph of article 416 of the Penal Code. Moreover, the crime and the commission thereof were duly proved by oral evidence, expert testimony, and by other evidence found in the record.<\/p> <p>The defendant pleaded not guilty, and alleged that for some time past he had been suffering from fever and had not enjoyed good health; he denied that he had entertained any resentment against his wife, mother-in-law, and sisters-in-law, or that he was jealous of his wife. He testified that he did not know that he had assaulted them or the servant girl, or that he had wounded them with a bolo, and that during the entire day of the 3d of October, 1908, he had had more or less intermittent fever at intervals of a few hours, and that after he had regained consciousness, which he had lost, and on realizing his situation, he found himself outside of his house and heard voices commanding him to surrender his weapon, and that he afterwards learned that his wife's family objected to his returning to his house.<\/p> <p>The defendant's counsel, without raising any question as to the actual commission of the alleged acts, or the allegation that the accused committed them, confined himself to the statement, in behalf of his client, that on the night of the crime the defendant was sick with fever and out of his mind and that in one of his paroxysms he committed the said acts, wounding his wife and the other members of her family, without any motives whatever.<\/p> <p>In the absence of proof that the defendant had lost his reason or became demented a few moments prior to or during the perpetration of the crime, it is presumed that he was in a normal condition of mind. It is improper to conclude that he acted unconsciously, in order to relieve him from responsibility on the ground of exceptional mental condition, unless his insanity and absence of will are proven.<\/p> <p>The record of the cause does not show full proof that Ramon Hontiveros, when he assaulted his wife and the other members of her family with whom she was living under the same roof, was deprived of his reason and that he did not have knowledge or complete consciousness of all that he had done. The physicians who examined him nine days after the commission of the said crimes were unable to state that the defendant was insane and completely deprived of his reason at the time he assaulted the offended parties. The mere opinion expressed by the physicians, in hypothetical terms, in regard to the possible mental condition of the accused and with respect to the circumstance that some members of the defendant's family may have been insane, does not tend to prove that the defendant was insane at the time of the commission of the crime. Acts penalized by law are always considered to be voluntary, unless the contrary be shown, and by this rule of law Ramon Hontiveros, by inflicting upon the offended parties the respective wounds, is considered to have been in a normal, healthy, mental condition, and no weight can be given to the defendant's allegation of insanity and lack of reason, which would constitute an exceptional condition; nor, for lack of evidence, can his state of mind be deemed to have been abnormal. Wherefore the defendant's guilt is unquestionable as the sole perpetrator, by direct participation, of the crime of <em>lesiones graves,<\/em> and it would not be proper to exempt him from liability.<\/p> <p>In the commission of the said crime there is no aggravating circumstance to be considered, but there is an extenuating circumstance, that of No. 7 of article 9 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the defendant acted under the impulse of jealousy, and therefore the penalty of <em>prision correccional<\/em> in its minimum and medium degrees should be imposed upon him in the minimum degree.<\/p> <p>For the foregoing reasons, and as the judgment appealed from is found to be in accordance with the law, it is proper, in our opinion, to affirm the same, which we hereby do, with the costs against the appellant who, in addition, is sentenced to the accessory penalties prescribed by article 61 of the Penal Code. So ordered.<\/p> <p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

It is\u00a0 unquestioned that the defendant had collected during the months of January, February, and March the sum of P223.50.\u00a0 During the month of January he collected P182.50, the principal part of which was made up of two fines imposed\u00a0 and collected by him, one of P1105 and the other of P60.\u00a0\u00a0 The items constituting the account of\u00a0 the\u00a0 justice\u00a0 of the peace for these three months were very few in number.\u00a0\u00a0 It is unbelievable that the accused, when he paid over to the treasurer the sum of P57.50, did not\u00a0 then\u00a0 know\u00a0 perfectly well that\u00a0 he owed the Government\u00a0 a much larger sum.\u00a0 In this particular case it is\u00a0 of no consequence\u00a0 that the treasurer did not ask more than P57.50.\u00a0 All\u00a0 public officials who have in their hands public moneys owe a duty to the Government, namely, the duty to pay over, not a portion, but all of said moneys. They owe the further duty of being fair\u00a0 to the Government, a duty which the accused failed to discharge in this case.\u00a0 He stood\u00a0 by\u00a0 and\u00a0 saw the\u00a0 receiving\u00a0 official\u00a0 make a clerical\u00a0 mistake in calculating the amount due from him to the Government,\u00a0 and took advantage of that\u00a0 mistake, knowing that it was a mistake and\u00a0 realizing that to take advantage thereof was unfair and unjust.\u00a0 A different question would be presented\u00a0 if the accounts were long and intricate.\u00a0 In\u00a0 that\u00a0 case\u00a0 an honest mistake\u00a0 might be\u00a0 made by the accounting officer in the sum\u00a0 which should be paid to the receiving official.\u00a0 An\u00a0 honest\u00a0 mistake by an official when rendering his account and\u00a0 paying over money is not criminal.\u00a0 Under the circumstances of this case, however, by reason\u00a0 of the fewness of the items, the largeness of the sum in his hands,\u00a0 and the simplicity of the accounts, it is impossible to believe otherwise than that the accused knew at the time that he was not paying to the Government all the money that was due it.\u00a0 Thus willfully failing to live up\u00a0 to his known duty and obligation\u00a0 to the public he appropriated such money to his own use.<br\/><br\/>In view of the fact, however, that the money was later repaid upon the instance of the accused himself and without any request upon the part of the treasurer, we are of the opinion that the minimum penalty ought to be imposed.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is hereby modified and the defendant is sentenced to two months of imprisonment in the provincial jail of Tarlac and to\u00a0 pay the costs of this action.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that the property is bounded on the north by a path and land owned by Calixto Luna; on the east by lands belonging to Ubaldo Tagabilla, Eugenio Bias, and Timoteo Caliba; on the south by\u00a0 lands\u00a0 of the same Caliba,\u00a0 Agustin Menor, Macario Lagac,\u00a0 Cipriano Daquigan,\u00a0 Eugenio Bias,\u00a0 and\u00a0 a sandy tract; and on\u00a0 the west by\u00a0 another\u00a0 sandy tract;\u00a0 that\u00a0 in 1900\u00a0 (the exact date being unknown) he pledged the said land to\u00a0 Francisca Gonzalez for the sum of 100 pesos, with a right\u00a0 to redeem it upon repayment of the amount; that in 1904 Gonzalez transferred her rights in the said land upon\u00a0 the said conditions to Valeriano Tomas, who in 1906 transferred\u00a0 his\u00a0 right to\u00a0 Gregorio Salmon for the sum\u00a0 of P140; that the defendants having been amicably requested to return the land\u00a0 in question\u00a0 to the plaintiff, upon payment\u00a0 of the last-mentioned\u00a0 amount\u00a0 of the\u00a0 pledge\u00a0 made in favor of Salmon; that the latter refused to comply with the request, wherefore the plaintiff prayed that judgment be rendered ordering the defendants to deliver the above-described land to the plaintiff, upon repayment of P140\u00a0 to Gregorio Salmon, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>Gregorio Salmon\u00a0 having been summoned, made written answer to the above complaint, stating that the lands mentioned therein were not the property of the plaintiff when they were sold\u00a0 to him by Valeriano Tomas, who was their exclusive owner, and therefore he prayed that judgment be rendered in his favor, and that the\u00a0 plaintiff be adjudged to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>The other\u00a0 defendant, Francisca Gonzalez, stated in her answer\u00a0 that\u00a0 she admitted as true the facts on which the plaintiff based his complaint,\u00a0 and that she therefore agreed to the redemption of the land described therein, and prayed that judgment be rendered\u00a0 in favor\u00a0 of the said plaintiff with the costs against the defendant Salmon.<br\/><br\/>Valeriano Tomas\u00a0 died on July 28, 1907, as appears from Exhibit B of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>After the hearing of the case and the evidence adduced by both parties, the documents\u00a0 exhibited having been made part of the record, the judge,\u00a0 on the 20th of July, 1908, rendered judgment\u00a0 therein, sentencing Gregorio Salmon to deliver the land claimed to the\u00a0 plaintiff Esteban Ranjo, upon\u00a0 repayment of P140, and\u00a0 to\u00a0 pay the costs.\u00a0 Counsel for the defendant Ranjo excepted\u00a0 to this\u00a0 decision,\u00a0 and asked for the annulment thereof on the ground that it\u00a0 was not sufficiently sustained by the evidence, that the findings deduced from the facts were clearly and manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence,\u00a0 and stated that, should his petition be\u00a0 denied, he\u00a0 excepted thereto and intended to file his\u00a0 bill of exceptions in the usual way; the motion\u00a0 was denied\u00a0 and\u00a0 the annulment asked\u00a0 for was declared to be improper, and\u00a0 his notice of intention to submit his bill of exceptions in the usual way having been admitted, the\u00a0 said bill of\u00a0 exceptions was\u00a0 prepared,\u00a0 certified, and approved, and thereafter filed with the clerk\u00a0 of this court.<br\/><br\/>It having been proved that Valeriano Tomas was not the owner of the\u00a0 land claimed by\u00a0 Esteban Ranjo, the allegation of Gregorio Salmon\u00a0 that it belonged to him can not be supported,\u00a0 since he\u00a0 acquired it by purchase\u00a0 from the said Tomas, who was not the\u00a0 owner.<br\/><br\/>Only the\u00a0 owner can\u00a0 dispose of property, without\u00a0 any other\u00a0 limitations than those prescribed by the law, and he has a right of action against the holder or possessor thereof to recover it.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 348, Civil Code.)\u00a0 If Valeriano Tomas was not the owner, but a mere mortgage\u00a0 creditor of the land in question, he could not sell\u00a0 it nor convey any' right of\u00a0 ownership to the defendant Salmon notwithstanding the document exhibited\u00a0 by the said defendant and marked \"A.\"<br\/><br\/>Article 1S59\u00a0 of the Civil Code reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A\u00a0 creditor can not\u00a0 appropriate to himself the things given\u00a0 in pledge or mortgage, nor dispose of them.\"<\/blockquote>What the creditor is\u00a0 entitled to do, after\u00a0 the\u00a0 principal obligation has become due, is to ask\u00a0 for the alienation of the things constituting the pledge or mortgage,\u00a0 in order to\u00a0 secure reimbursement.\u00a0\u00a0 (Art. 1858 of the same code.)<br\/><br\/>Valeriano Tomas, in order to obtain\u00a0 the 125 pesos he had loaned to Francisca Gonzalez, by way\u00a0 of mortgage on\u00a0 said land, conveyed his rights to Gregorio\u00a0 Salmon for the\u00a0 sum of\u00a0 140 pesos,\u00a0 which was paid to him by the latter.\u00a0 Valeriano Tomas testified under oath to this effect in the document presented by the plaintiff (Exhibit A), which document was ratified before\u00a0 a notary, the contents of which confirm the statements made by Francisca Gonzalez in her written answer to the complaint, agreeing to the pretensions of the plaintiff, Ranjo, and\u00a0 directly contradict the contents of the document exhibited by the defendant Salmon as\u00a0 evidence of his allegation that he\u00a0 is\u00a0 the owner\u00a0 of the said land.\u00a0 The latter allegation is wholly\u00a0 unfounded,\u00a0 inasmuch as, if his title of ownership is derived, according to his answer to the complaint, from the right of the said Valeriano Tomas, it\u00a0 having been\u00a0 proved that\u00a0 the latter was not the owner of the land, but a mere creditor with the right to\u00a0 recover his credit\u00a0 from\u00a0 the proceeds of the sale of\u00a0 the property, it is undisputable that he could not dispose\u00a0 of the land nor sell it absolutely and finally to the defendant Salmon, as the latter pretends,\u00a0 basing\u00a0 his pretension\u00a0 on the said document of sale, which is notoriously inefficient because it is a contract wholly null and\u00a0 void.<br\/><br\/>The other defendant, Francisca Gonzalez, stated in her sworn\u00a0 testimony that after having held the land\u00a0 under mortgage for four years, and\u00a0 being\u00a0 in\u00a0 need of\u00a0 money, after having\u00a0 notified\u00a0 its\u00a0 owner Esteban Ranjo,\u00a0 she\u00a0 in turn mortgaged it to\u00a0 Valeriano Tomas, from whom\u00a0 she received\u00a0 125\u00a0 pesos; no new document\u00a0 was then executed, but she simply indorsed the old one executed by\u00a0 her and Esteban Ranjo; the latter in his sworn testimony confirmed Gonzalez's statements and added that he had inherited the said land from his mother, and that\u00a0 it is at present in possession of\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant' Salmon, because the former mortgagee, Valeriano Tomas, had\u00a0 mortgaged it to him; and that, as Tomas assured him that upon paying Salmon the\u00a0 140\u00a0 pesos received as loan he could recover the land without any objection, he went to see the defendant Salmon (because Tomas was sick), to redeem\u00a0 the land, and presented to him a letter from Tomas; but Salmon refused to receive the money, saying that he wanted to deliver the land to the\u00a0 same person from whom he had received it.<br\/><br\/>From the above-stated facts it appears that the document evidencing the mortgage,\u00a0 and\u00a0 which\u00a0 Francisca Gonzalez avers\u00a0 was\u00a0 executed\u00a0 and\u00a0 indorsed to\u00a0 Valeriano Tomas, must have been\u00a0 delivered to the last\u00a0 mortgagee, Gregorio Salmon; and the latter having failed to exhibit it at the trial (since\u00a0 the said document contains and shows the successive mortgages to\u00a0 which the land in question has been subjected),\u00a0 it must have been because\u00a0 it\u00a0 did not suit the defendant Salmon to produce such a document, which is evidently incompatible with the document of sale exhibited by him,\u00a0 the facts related\u00a0 by the\u00a0 plaintiff and\u00a0 Francisca Gonzalez being moreover corroborated by the notary, David Cleto, and by the witness, Alejandro Bias.<br\/><br\/>The character of the plaintiff, as owner of the land, is denied and questioned, but the defendant does not take into account the\u00a0 fact that\u00a0 he himself acknowledges and admits that he had acquired\u00a0 it from Valeriano Tomas;\u00a0 and, as it is a\u00a0 fact that the latter had in turn received it from Francisca Gonzalez, in whose favor it was mortgaged by Esteban Ranjo, it is\u00a0 undisputable that the\u00a0 first and true owner of the\u00a0 land mortgaged\u00a0 is the plaintiff,\u00a0 inasmuch\u00a0 as it has not been shown that\u00a0 it was Valeriano Tomas who, according to the defendant, sold and conveyed to him the land in controversy.<br\/><br\/>The act of selling or alienating real or personal property to another person conveys the ownership of the\u00a0 vendor as to the thing sold; one who is not the owner can not perform any\u00a0 act which would tranfer the ownership, nor could his pretended transferee\u00a0 acquire any\u00a0 rights in\u00a0 the\u00a0 property, because his\u00a0 vendor did not convey to\u00a0 him\u00a0 any right of ownership.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the judgment appealed from being in accordance with the\u00a0 law and\u00a0 the merits of the\u00a0 case, it is\u00a0 our opinion that it\u00a0 should be and\u00a0 it\u00a0 is hereby\u00a0 affirmed,\u00a0 with the costs\u00a0 against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.\u00a0 J., Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

The court decided them by adjudging that Pua Te Ching should pay the amounts claimed. Pua Te Ching, for the purpose of staying the execution of the judgments rendered, during the pendency of his appeal, presented as sureties in the three aforesaid cases, Pua Ti, of Calle Rosario No. 150, and Jose Temprado Yap Chatco, of Calle Sagasta, San Fernando, Pampanga. All three of them, the appellant and his sureties, executed the proper bonds: In case No. 6347, for P3,784; in No. 6348, for P4,000; and in No. 6349, for M.,000, \"for which payment well and truly to be made,\" the bond reads, \"we, the appellant and the sureties, jointly and severally bind ourselves,\" it being expressly stipulated \"that the appellant and the sureties are held and firmly bound to the appellee, jointly and severally, in the sum expressed in each bond, to secure the fulfillment and payment of the judgment so appealed, together with the costs, in case the same should be affirmed, in whole or in part, or in case the judgment should become effective on account of the appellant's having abandoned or withdrawn the appeal, or in case it should be dismissed or declared to be improperly allowed.\"<br\/><br\/>The appeal having been heard by this court, which rendered a decision affirming the judgment of the lower court and, while the latter was about to proceed with the execution of the said judgment, the sureties Jose Temprado Yap Chatco and Pua Ti set forth: That Pua Te Ching died intestate on September 2, 1909, and the decision of this court was rendered after his death; that the estate of the late Pua Te Ching was in the course of administration; and that, therefore, the decision of the Supreme Court was null and of no value, it having been pronounced against a person already dead, and that an execution thereof could not be issued against the said Pua Te Ching.<br\/><br\/>The lower court decided that, notwithstanding the death of the principal surety, the sureties who subscribed the bond were liable for the amount of the judgment entered against their principal, and in virtue thereof ordered \"that the judgment entered in these cases against the defendant Pua Te Ching and in favor of the plaintiff shall be extensive against the sureties who subscribed the bond, named Pua Ti and Jose Temprado Yap Chatco, jointly and severally, and execution shall issue on the said judgments.\"<br\/><br\/>These sureties filed notice of appeal and, having forwarded their bill of exceptions, alleged error against the judgment appealed from in that therein the execution of a judgment was ordered notwithstanding the death of the appellant which occurred before the affirmation of the decision of the lower court. In support of their allegation they invoke sections 119 and 448 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the provisions of which, especially those of section 448, may be invoked by the sureties in their favor by virtue of the provisions of articles 1148 and 1853, in relation to article 1822, of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>Article 1822, invoked by the appellant, provides that \"if the surety binds himself jointly with the principal debtor, the provisions of section fourth, chapter third, title first, of this book shall be observed,\" that is, of book fourth of the Civil Code.\u00a0 Section fourth of the chapter, title, and book mentioned provides that \"a creditor may sue any of the joint debtors qr all of them simultaneously.\" (Art. 1144.) In conformity with this provision, the sureties Pua Ti and Yap Chatco having bound themselves in solidum (jointly and severally) with the principal debtor Pua Te Ching, the creditor, that is, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, may sue any of them or all of them simultaneously: which is what the Chinese Chamber of Commerce did in filing suit against the joint and several debtors.<br\/><br\/>But the basis of appellant's argument in alleging error because of the application of this provision of the law, is the benefit granted by articles 1148 and 1853.<br\/><br\/>Article 1853, which is one of the provisions made in the matter of bonds and is a reproduction of article 1148 on joint and several obligations in general, reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A surety may set up against the creditor all the exceptions which pertain to the principal debtor and which may be inherent to the debt; but not those which may be purely personal to the debtor.\"<\/blockquote>The whole question which this court has to decide is whether the sureties Pua Ti and Yap Chatco have set up against the creditor any exception which pertains to the principal debtor, Pua Te Ching, and which may be inherent to the debt. If the exception which pertains to the principal debtor, Pua Te Ching, is purely personal to him, it is evident that the sureties of Pua Te Ching can not set it up against the creditor.<br\/><br\/>Exceptions of the principal debtor which the surety may utilize and which may be inherent to the debt, are all those connected with the obligation secured by the bond, all those which may contribute to weaken or destroy the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vinculum juris <\/span>existing between the creditor and the principal debtor, all means of defense which may invalidate the original contract from which the right or the action of the creditor arises against the surety, such as the exceptions of fraud or of violence, which annul consent, that of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sine atione agis<\/span> founded on a payment already made, that of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">res adjudicate,<\/span>\", that of prescription, that of nullity of the loan made to a minor child, and others of the same class. (12 Manresa, Civil Code, 363.)<br\/><br\/>The exception which, according to the appellants, pertains to the principal debtor Pua Te Ching, inasmuch as he died, is that provided by sections 119 and 448 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Section 119 relates to the continuance of the action by or against the executor, administrator or other legal representative of the deceased, and, if the action is for the recovery of money, the payment of a debt or of damages, to its discontinuance and prosecution in the proceedings instituted for the settlement of the estate of the deceased; and section 448 provides that, notwithstanding the death of a party after the judgment, \"execution thereon may be issued, or one already issued may be enforced as follows: (1) In case of the death of the judgment creditor, upon the application of his executor or administrator or successor in interest; (2), in case of the death of the judgment debtor, if the judgment be for the recovery of real or personal property, or the enforcement of a lien thereon.\" All these provisions concern the manner of execution relative to the obligation against the estate of Pua Te Ching, but in nowise affect the validity and force of the obligation contracted by Pua Te Ching toward the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in such a way as to serve the joint and several sureties of Pua Te Ching as a defense inherent to the latter's debt to be set up against the execution, now that they are the judgment debtors made liable for payment. They are all defenses to oppose an execution against the estate of Pua Te Ching, as the appellants say, and all of them are against the execution of the obligation, but not against the obligation itself. They are not even personal defenses of the principal debtor against the obligation; still less are they defenses inherent to the debt itself, which are the only ones that, as pertaining to the principal debtor, may be utilized by the sureties.<br\/><br\/>It is useless to allege the impropriety of an execution of a judgment against the estate of a person deceased when it is not a question of such an execution against the estate of a deceased person.<br\/><br\/>It is useless to allege how the payment of money should be sued for against the estate of a deceased person, when it is not a question of a suit of this kind, nor of any other, but of the execution of a judgment against certain sureties who bound themselves jointly and severally to pay the amount of the obligation concerned in the case at bar \"in case the judgment should be affirmed in whole or in part.\" The judgment sentencing the principal debtor Pua Te Ching to pay the amounts claimed, having been wholly affirmed, the case now stands for execution to issue against the sureties for securing payment of the said amounts by them in place of Pua Te Ching or with Pua Te Ching, as they had bound themselves to do. The creditor having chosen to have the execution issue against them alone without Pua Te Ching, they alone, without Pua Te Ching and without reference whatever to the estate of Pua Te Ching, must be compelled to pay by means of judicial compulsion through execution.<br\/><br\/>The provisions contained in articles 1148 and 1853 of the Civil Code do not apply to the sureties, the appellants; and the judgment of the trial court, which finds the sureties liable for the payment of the debt, put into execution by virtue of final decision, is entirely in accord with the law.<br\/><br\/>The record does not show that it is a question of the execution of a judgment entered after the death of the principal debtor. No proof whatever exists of this fact, nor even of the fact of the death of the principal debtor.<br\/><br\/>The lower court, on the truth of this hypothesis, decided that, notwithstanding the death of the principal obligor, the sureties are compelled to pay the amount set forth in the judgment rendered.<br\/><br\/>That this court should not render a decision affirmatory of that of the lower court on account of the death of the defendant, is a point that absolutely does not concern this incident of the execution of judgment, nor was evidence adduced to show anything specific against the rendering of such an affirmatory decision.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Chicote, Miranda &amp; Sierra, and these gentlemen then transferred it in turn to Rafael Sierra, one of the members of the\u00a0 said firm, who afterwards made a gift of the said house to the minor defendants.\u00a0 The\u00a0 complaint\u00a0 alleges\u00a0 that these\u00a0 successive transfers\u00a0 of the property to Chicote, Miranda &amp;\u00a0 Sierra, to Sierra,\u00a0 and finally to the defendants, are\u00a0 null and void, for the reason that the said house never belonged to the said Carmen Carvajal.\u00a0\u00a0 The plaintiff\u00a0 therefore prays that the said transfers be\u00a0 declared null\u00a0 and\u00a0 void,\u00a0 and that it be declared that the defendants have no right whatever to the said house and that the plaintiff is the owner thereof.<br\/><br\/>Ramon\u00a0 Sotelo, the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i> of the defendants, Francisco Reyes, Maria de los Dolores,\u00a0 Jose Reyes, Maria Luisa Reyes, Manuel Reyes, and Carlos Reyes, in his answer to the complaint, of November 18, 1908,\u00a0 set forth: That he denied\u00a0 generally and specifically all the allegations of the amended complaint, in so far as they were not in harmony with the amended\u00a0 answer, as well as each and all of the allegations contained in paragraphs\u00a0 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the said amended complaint, and also each and all of the allegations of paragraph 4 thereof, in so far as they did not agree with his\u00a0 answer.\u00a0\u00a0 As a special defense, he alleged: That on September 22, 1894, Dolores Carvajal y Guivelondo constructed,\u00a0 with her own funds, the building mentioned; that about the year 1905, the law firm composed of Attorneys Chicote, Miranda &amp; Sierra rendered professional services to Francisco Reyes y Mij ares, the father of the\u00a0 defendants and\u00a0 husband of\u00a0 the\u00a0 aforesaid Dolores\u00a0 Carvajal, earning therefor fees in the sum of Pll,000 and incurring expenses, chargeable to their client,\u00a0 amounting to P33; that on November 10, 1905, Francisco Reyes y Mijares, by\u00a0 virtue of a power of attorney executed in his favor by his said wife, deeded\u00a0 the house,in question to\u00a0 the\u00a0 said firm of Chicote, Miranda\u00a0 &amp;\u00a0 Sierra, in payment\u00a0 of\u00a0 the said\u00a0 fees;\u00a0 that about the month\u00a0 of May,\u00a0 1906, Rafael Sierra,\u00a0 one\u00a0 of the members\u00a0 of the said firm, ceased to belong thereto and, as a result of a settlement effected between these law partners, he was\u00a0 awarded, together with other property, the respective\u00a0 shares which Miranda and Chicote had in the house mentioned; that subsequently Sierra, in consideration of the ties of affection and love which had united him with the defendants and\u00a0 their parents, and because of the innumerable kindnesses\u00a0 and favors which he had received from the latter, made a free, absolute and irrevocable\u00a0 gift of the property\u00a0 described\u00a0 to the\u00a0 minor defendants;\u00a0 that\u00a0 all the said transfers were made in good faith and for just motives, and that the plaintiff\u00a0 Garcia was not a party to\u00a0 any\u00a0 of the contracts, the annulment of which is asked,\u00a0 nor was he either a principal or a subsidiary obligor.\u00a0\u00a0 The said Ramon Sotelo therefore prayed that the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 be absolved from the amended complaint.<br\/><br\/>The case having come to\u00a0 trial and testimony been produced by both parties, the judge, by order\u00a0 of May 11, 1909, dismissed the said amended complaint with the costs against the plaintiff, who, on being notified thereof, duly excepted thereto and announced his intention to file a bill\u00a0 of exceptions which, when\u00a0 presented, was\u00a0 approved, certified\u00a0 and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>As may be seen from the foregoing review of the proceedings, the plaintiff seeks an annulment of the transfers made of the house that belonged to Francisco Reyes, the defendants' father, and which was sold at public auction\u00a0 by the sheriff of this city\u00a0 to the plaintiff,\u00a0 Juan\u00a0 Garcia,\u00a0 who contends that the minor defendants have no right whatever to the said house, inasmuch as he is the sole owner thereof.<br\/><br\/>The issues of\u00a0 fact and of law relative to the fundamental features of this\u00a0 litigation, and the\u00a0 questions as to whether the plaintiff\u00a0 is or is not entitled to ask for the annulment of the successive transfers of the said house, and as to its donation to the\u00a0 minor\u00a0 defendants,\u00a0 will be resolved at the proper time when the final decision\u00a0 is rendered, which will also decide whether the plaintiff, as a result of the said sale effected by the sheriff, is the legitimate owner of the house referred to.<br\/><br\/>However, in order to bring this suit duly to a close, it is imperative to determine the only question raised in connection with the pending appeal, to wit, whether all the persons who intervened in the matter of the transfers and donation herein referred\u00a0 to, are\u00a0 or are not necessary parties to this suit, since it is asked in the complaint that the said transfers and\u00a0 donation be declared null and void\u00a0 an indispensable declaration for the purpose, in a proper case, of concluding the plaintiff to be the sole owner of the house in dispute.<br\/><br\/>If such a declaration\u00a0 of annulment can directly affect the persons who made\u00a0 and who were\u00a0 concerned\u00a0 in\u00a0 the said transfers, nothing could be more proper\u00a0 and just than to hear them\u00a0 in the litigation, as parties interested\u00a0 in main taining\u00a0 the\u00a0 validity of those\u00a0 transactions,\u00a0 and therefore, whatever be the nature of the judgment rendered,\u00a0 Francisco\u00a0 Reyes,\u00a0 Dolores Carvajal,\u00a0 Alfredo Chicote, Vicente Miranda, and Rafael Sierra, besides the said minors, must be included in the case as defendants.<br\/><br\/>Section 114 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every action must be prosecuted\u00a0 in the name of the real party in interest.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"Any\u00a0 person should be made a\u00a0 defendant who has or claims an interest in the controversy or the\u00a0 subject matter thereof adverse to the plaintiff, or who is a necessary party to a complete determination or settlement of the questions involved therein.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>Section 122 of the same code prescribes:<br\/><blockquote>\"The\u00a0 court\u00a0 may\u00a0 determine any controversy\u00a0 between parties before it, if\u00a0 it can be done without prejudice\u00a0 to the rights of others, or by preserving their rights for future action; but, when a complete determination of the controversy can not be had without the presence of other parties, the court must order them to be brought in,\u00a0 and to that\u00a0 end may order amended or supplemental pleadings, or a cross complaint, to be filed, and\u00a0 summons therein\u00a0 to be duly issued and served.\"<\/blockquote>In the order from which appeal is\u00a0 taken\u00a0 it is\u00a0 admitted that it would be impossible, to decide the allegations made in the complaint without a previous hearing of all the parties interested who may\u00a0 be affected by the final\u00a0 decision of\u00a0 the present litigation;\u00a0 wherefore\u00a0 the provisions of law contained in the two preinserted sections\u00a0 must be\u00a0 complied with, and if the plaintiff shall so include the said parties in a new amended complaint, the judge, fulfilling the requirements of the law, must, in accordance therewith,\u00a0 continue the trial\u00a0 through all its proceedings.<br\/><br\/>The nonobservance of the rules established by the Code of Procedure for\u00a0 the\u00a0 substantiation and proper decision\u00a0 of causes in which questions of controversy between the parties are ventilated prevents the due determination of the\u00a0 same with respect to the fundamental issues\u00a0 of the litigation and makes\u00a0 it necessary to decide, in the first place, such questions as relate to the form of the action.\u00a0 Obedience to the rules of procedure, established by law for the substantiation and proper decision of a cause, is a matter of public policy.<br\/><br\/>It is to be presumed\u00a0 that\u00a0 the parties herein before mentioned, and the representative of the said minors, are directly interested in sustaining the. validity of the deed, transfers, and donation above-mentioned; wherefore, now that it\u00a0 is asked that the same be annulled, in order that they may defend themselves, they must\u00a0 be considered as necessary parties\u00a0 to this suit, since, without their being heard or their intervention,\u00a0 it would be impossible, validly to declare, in a proper\u00a0 case, the said transfers and donation null and void, nor, without\u00a0 such a declaration, could the\u00a0 prayer be granted in case it were proper so to do, which proposes that the plaintiff be found to be the sole owner of the property. (Sanidad <i>vs.<\/i> Cabotaje, 5 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 204; Rugman <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Ruguian, 9 Phil. Rep., 527.)<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, it is\u00a0 proper, in our\u00a0 opinion, with a\u00a0 revocation of the order\u00a0 of dismissal appealed from, to return the case\u00a0 to the Court of First Instance, in order that, if the plaintiff should amend his complaint byjncluding therein as defendants the representative of the minors and all the parties mentioned in this decision as being interested in the present litigation, the court may continue the trial and in\u00a0 due time render\u00a0 such judgment as the law\u00a0 and the evidence demand.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

The usual process of the court shall be available for collecting such costs.\u00a0\u00a0 The work of survey and demarcation\u00a0 shall not be suspended because of the presentation of any complaint or objection.\"<\/blockquote>Section 5 of said Act is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It\u00a0 shall be the\u00a0 duty of private\u00a0 surveyors who make surveys, maps, or plats\u00a0 of property for which registration of title is requested to comply with the requirements of the preceding section and to promptly send their reports, surveys,\u00a0 maps, and plats\u00a0 of\u00a0 such property\u00a0 to\u00a0 the Bureau of Lands for verification.\u00a0\u00a0 Private surveyors\u00a0 shall not be authorized to make surveys for the Court of Land Registration unless they shall have passed either\u00a0 a civil service examination or an examination by the Bureau of Lands for the purpose of determining their qualifications.\"<\/blockquote>The appellee contends that, inasmuch\u00a0 as his plans\u00a0 had been prepared\u00a0 long\u00a0 before the enactment of the\u00a0 said\u00a0 Act No. 1875, the same was\u00a0 not applicable, for the reason that to make the law applicable to the present case would be giving to said law a retroactive\u00a0 effect, and\u00a0 cites\u00a0 article 3 of the Civil Code and rules\u00a0 1 and 2 <i>De\u00a0 las Disposiciones Transitorias <\/i>of the\u00a0 Civil Code,\u00a0 as well\u00a0 as\u00a0 volume 12 of Manresa, page 922, in support of his contention.<br\/><br\/>In our opinion\u00a0 the law does not have a retroactive effect.

As\u00a0 there is a co-defendant in this case who has entered a plea of\u00a0 'not guilty,' or for whom a plea of not guilty has been entered, it would be improper to make a statement of these circumstances at this time.\u00a0\u00a0 For that reason the defense asks\u00a0 the court for\u00a0 an\u00a0 opportunity to be heard for a consideration of the circumstances, which the defense considers have a bearing upon the penalty to be imposed, prior to fixing the penalty upon the defendant Grant.\"\u00a0 Plea of guilty entered.<br\/><br\/>\"The Court.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant Grant having pleaded guilty and a plea of not guilty having been\u00a0 entered as to the defendant Kennedy and he having announced himself ready for trial the trial will now proceed.\"<\/blockquote>After hearing the proofs adduced and\u00a0 arguments\u00a0 of counsel the trial court found these accused guilty as charged in the complaint and sentenced each of them to one year's imprisonment and to pay one-half the costs.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants appealed and have filed separate briefs with their corresponding assignment of errors.\u00a0 In view of the exhaustive briefs filed by both the appellants and the Government we think\u00a0 it pertinent to set forth in full the assignment\u00a0 of errors of each one of the appellants.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Appellant Kennedy<\/span>.)<br\/><\/div><blockquote>\"l.

The accused being arraigned upon this complaint on\u00a0 the 17th day of that month pleaded\u00a0 not guilty.\u00a0 On the\u00a0 8th of September\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">counsel\u00a0 for the defendant\u00a0 Kennedy\u00a0 moved the court and demanded that, owing to the fact that\u00a0 the two complaints against Kennedy and Grant were identical in character and wording except only\u00a0 the dates and the names of the defendants, the prosecuting attorney file a new\u00a0 complaint against these two accused, charging\u00a0 them jointly and severally with\u00a0 the commission of this crime.<\/span> Subsequently thereto, and on the 8th of October, the prosecuting attorneys asked that this complaint against Kennedy be dismissed for the reason that he had filed a new complaint against said\u00a0 Kennedy, this new complaint being the one upon which he was tried.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Grant went to Hongkong in\u00a0 June, 1909, for the purpose of buying some machinery for the Philippines Gold Dredging Company, and remained in Hongkong from\u00a0 the 15th\u00a0 to the 19th, arriving in Manila\u00a0 on his return on the 21st of that month.\u00a0 He bought part of the machinery from the Wampoo Dock Company and a part of it from William Barker and Co.\u00a0 Barker was to ship this machinery to Manila.\u00a0 Grant\u00a0 wrote E. B. Morris &amp;\u00a0 Co, customs brokers in Manila,\u00a0 asking them to see that\u00a0 this machinery be transhipped from the S. S. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Tean<\/span> to the S. S. Begonia,\u00a0 bound for\u00a0 Paracale where this mining machinery was to be\u00a0 used,\u00a0 stating to Morris &amp; Co. that he had arranged\u00a0 with the customs authorities for the inspection of this machinery\u00a0 at the boat and that everything would go through quickly and easily.\u00a0 On the 23d of July Grant received the\u00a0 invoices for this machinery from Barker &amp; Co., which invoices included the main bulk and also items numbered in\u00a0 said invoices from 25 to 34, inclusive.<br\/><br\/>In a letter which Grant received about July 25th Barker explained\u00a0 the shipment of the extra nine pieces of machinery and\u00a0 requested Grant to\u00a0 hand them\u00a0 over to a\u00a0 Mr. Francisco.\u00a0 Grant then\u00a0 told Morris\u00a0 &amp; Co. that certain parts of the machinery, referring to the nine pieces above enumerated, were to be landed at the custom house wharf. Eight of\u00a0 these nine pieces, consisting\u00a0 of four\u00a0 shaftings and\u00a0 four\u00a0 columns, or boiler supports,\u00a0 were landed\u00a0 and moved to the shop of Mr.\u00a0 Taylor.\u00a0 There the\u00a0 shaftings and columns\u00a0 were\u00a0 opened by the employees of Mr. Taylor in the presence of two inspectors of the Bureau of Customs, and also in the presence of Mr. Taylor and Mr. Earnshaw, and it was found that\u00a0 these shaftings\u00a0 and columns\u00a0 had been bored out and\u00a0 the hollow\u00a0 tubes filled with tins of opium.\u00a0 Later, the other piece,\u00a0 a steam hoisting winch, was examined\u00a0 at the custom-house and found to contain bottles of cocaine and morphine.<br\/><br\/>There were 210 kilos of opium and 11 kilos of cocaine and morphine.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 legitimate price of opium in Manila at this time\u00a0 was from\u00a0 fifty\u00a0 to sixty pesos\u00a0 per kilo; that is, when opium was imported for pharmaceutical purposes, but opium sold illegitimately was worth\u00a0 from two to four hundred pesos\u00a0 per kilo.\u00a0 These nine extra\u00a0 pieces of machinery which contained the opium, morphine, and cocaine were landed in Manila on the 24th of July,\u00a0 1909, and the defendant Grant\u00a0 was arrested on this charge on\u00a0 the\u00a0 30th of the same month.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant Kennedy was arrested on the 20th of August, 1909.<br\/><br\/>Before any of the\u00a0 machinery\u00a0 or the\u00a0 nine extra pieces were taken off\u00a0 of the S. S.\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Tean, <\/span>Grant, according to his testimony, had a conversation with Kennedy with reference to these\u00a0 nine extra pieces, and in this\u00a0 conversation Kennedy informed\u00a0 him that there was\u00a0 opium aboard the\u00a0 boat concealed in that machinery; that after this conversation he, Grant, arranged to have these nine extra pieces of machinery landed on the river front.\u00a0 Morris testified that he landed these\u00a0 nine pieces of machinery on the river\u00a0 front in accordance with instructions from Grant.\u00a0 So the opium, cocaine, and morphine was brought into\u00a0 the\u00a0 Philippine Islands and landed without the intervention of the customs authorities, except the granting of the permit, not knowing at the time this permit\u00a0 was granted that these nine extra pieces contained contraband goods.<br\/><br\/>That this opium, cocaine,\u00a0 and morphine was\u00a0 illegally brought into the Philippine Islands from\u00a0 a foreign country there can be no question. The defendant Kennedy insists that he had nothing whatever to\u00a0 do with the importation of this opium, but admits that he did enter into an agreement to purchase, when safely landed and delivered to him and after an examination to be made by him, the four tubes and\u00a0 the opium contained\u00a0 in them for P8,800, or P10,000, Hongkong money.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Grant\u00a0 was\u00a0 called as\u00a0 a witness for\u00a0 the prosecution and testified on first examination that he\u00a0 did not purchase these nine extra pieces of machinery in Hongkong and knew nothing about them until he received\u00a0 the letter, Exhibit J, from Barker &amp; Co. explaining\u00a0 the shipment of the same;\u00a0 that on receipt\u00a0 of this letter\u00a0 he called on Francisco and\u00a0 afterwards consulted at various times with Kennedy about these pieces and their contents.\u00a0 These nine pieces were included\u00a0 in the regular invoice of machinery,\u00a0 dated\u00a0 in Hongkong the 15th of July,\u00a0 1909, and\u00a0 the letter from Barker &amp;\u00a0 Co. was dated in the same city on the 23d of that month.<br\/><br\/>Grant was recalled by the prosecution near the close of the trial and admitted that\u00a0 he\u00a0 had testified falsely with reference to his prior knowledge of the nine pieces of machinery and their\u00a0 contents, and stated that he did know about this matter as the same had been arranged by prior agreement between\u00a0 himself, Kennedy, and another party. After Grant had been arrested an\u00a0 arrangement was made for him\u00a0 and Kennedy to have\u00a0 a\u00a0 conversation about\u00a0 the illegal importation of this opium, and in pursuance of this arrangement\u00a0 Kennedy went to Grant's\u00a0 hotel a little after eight p. m. on\u00a0 August 7,\u00a0 1909, and there the matter was discussed.\u00a0 By\u00a0 previous arrangement Cooley, a member of the secret service\u00a0 force\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Philippines Constabulary, was secreted in the room where the conversation took place. The presence of Cooley was not known to Kennedy.\u00a0 Cooley admits that he was\u00a0 anxious to find out who were connected with\u00a0 the importation of\u00a0 this opium and counsel for\u00a0 defendant Kennedy insists that for this reason, and also for the further reason that Cooley was a secret service agent, his testimony is not worthy of\u00a0 credit as against that of Kennedy.\u00a0 As to\u00a0 what he heard during this conversation Cooley testified:<br\/><blockquote>\"When he [Kennedy] first came in they passed the time of day and Grant asked Kennedy what the news was from Hongkong.\u00a0 Kennedy replied that everything was all right. He had just\u00a0 received a cable that the only people\u2014the custom house people\u2014the only thing that the custom people had done\u00a0 was to take Mr. Barker before\u00a0 the\u00a0 United\u00a0 States consul in Hongkong (p. 60).<br\/><br\/>\"And then Grant asked him if he was not afraid they would get some of the people connected with it in\u00a0 Hongkong.\u00a0 He said no, that all parties interested in Hongkong had been notified\u00a0 by him\u00a0 both by cable and\u00a0 letter and had gone to Manchuria.\u00a0 On that point I am not sure whether he said on the Manchuria or gone to Manchuria (p.\u00a0 61).<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Did he\u00a0 say anything about the money; where the money came from?\u00a0 I mean by he,\u00a0 Mr. Kennedy\u2014A. Mr. Grant asked\u00a0 Mr. Kennedy if the parties who had\u00a0 prepared the machinery with\u00a0 the opium for shipment\u00a0 had any financial interest in the matter and Kennedy replied that they had two thousand pesos in the enterprise and that he, Kennedy, had furnished the rest of a total\u00a0 of ten\u00a0 thousand five hundred pesos, two thousand of which had\u00a0 been furnished by the Hongkong people.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Who furnished the other?\u2014A. Kennedy said he, Kennedy, did.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Now did he say anything\u00a0 to Mr. Grant as to what Mr. Grant should\u00a0 do in regard to\u00a0 the matter?\u2014A. Yes, sir. Mr. Grant asked\u00a0 him the question, I want\u00a0 to talk\u00a0 to you and find out what you want me to do in this matter.\u00a0 Mr. Kennedy\u00a0 replied make a strong fight.\u00a0 I have already lost a good deal of money but I will stand attorney fees.\u00a0\u00a0 I will pay all lawyer's fees and fine.\u00a0\u00a0 Do not implicate me in the matter.\u00a0 Mr. Grant said\u00a0 then, you want me to stand pat and he said yes, I want you to stand pat (pp. 61, 66). <br\/><br\/>\"Q. State to the court then the conversation that occurred between Mrs. Grant and\u00a0 Kennedy.\u2014A.\u00a0 Mrs. Grant\u00a0 asked Kennedy if his brother was named Kennedy.\u00a0\u00a0 Kennedy said he is not my real brother.\u00a0 He is my foster\u00a0 brother.\u00a0\u00a0 No, he has a Chinese name, and Mrs. Grant\u00a0 then asked him\u2014 Mr. Kennedy you say you want Mr. Grant not to\u00a0 talk.

The reply to this letter shows that Kennedy's agent was moving\u00a0 in the matter and asked for further instructions, These instructions were given\u00a0 by Kennedy in his\u00a0 letter\u00a0 of July 6,\u00a0 the\u00a0 principal\u00a0 part of which\u00a0 we have heretofore quoted.\u00a0 In this letter Kennedy\u00a0 gave\u00a0 specific\u00a0 instructions to his\u00a0 agent to procure the cloth\u00a0 (opium) for\u00a0 Barker, Grant's\u00a0 agent, and turn it over\u00a0 to him (Barker)\u00a0 and let him pack and send it.\u00a0 Kennedy instructed his agent\u00a0 to thereafter use the word\u00a0 \"cloth\" instead of\u00a0 \"opium,\"\u00a0 and to use the other words given in\u00a0 his letter in place of the names of Grant and Barker.\u00a0 Kennedy's agent replied\u00a0 to this letter that:\u00a0 \"I will arrange everything with Barker\u00a0 in an early possible date.\"\u00a0 So it is clear from these communications and the\u00a0 testimony of Cooley, Grant,\u00a0 and Kennedy himself that Kennedy and his agent did provide the opium in Hongkong, and that Grant's agent\u00a0 did pack the same and attend\u00a0 to\u00a0 its transportation.\u00a0 This\u00a0 was\u00a0 the agreement entered into between\u00a0 Grant and Kennedy.\u00a0\u00a0 The procuring of the opium was of more importance than the packing\u00a0 and shipping of same.\u00a0 The fact that Kennedy did\u00a0 on June 1 pay a large sum of money to Grant, according to his own testimony,\u00a0 is a\u00a0 circumstance showing the intimate\u00a0 relations existing between the\u00a0 two parties at that time,\u00a0 and that they were acting together in business. Kennedy\u00a0 says\u00a0 that he paid this money for contraband. This\u00a0 money was paid on the very\u00a0 day that\u00a0 the cablegram quoted was\u00a0 sent to Grant's agent in Hongkong.\u00a0 Some significance should be attached to\u00a0 this testimony.\u00a0 Some of\u00a0 the words\u00a0 in that cablegram are untranslated, but it certainly referred to the shipping of goods\u00a0 of\u00a0 some\u00a0 kind.\u00a0 Kennedy's\u00a0 testimony, including\u00a0 the letters and\u00a0 cablegrams presented by\u00a0 him, expose in greater detail the relations existing between\u00a0 himself and Grant in this deal and the part taken by each\u00a0 than does the testimony of Grant.\u00a0 He showed that Grant was more involved than Grant himself was willing to admit at first.\u00a0\u00a0 The cablegrams above quoted, between Kennedy and his agent at Hongkong,\u00a0 show detailed instructions and the completion of the transaction as far as Kennedy was concerned. This testimony shows\u00a0 beyond any quetion\u00a0 of\u00a0 a doubt that Kennedy\u00a0 and Grant entered into an agreement to bring this opium,\u00a0 cocaine, and morphine into the Philippine Islands; that they both acted together in the entire transaction, and that Kennedy with the assistance of his agent in Hongkong furnished the opium, while Grant\u00a0 with the assistance of Barker packed and shipped it.\u00a0\u00a0 The opium was landed in Manila in this manner.\u00a0\u00a0 Grant and Kennedy agreed to\u00a0 do this and did\u00a0 do\u00a0 it.\u00a0\u00a0 They completed the act of bringing contraband goods into the Philippine Islands contrary to law.<br\/><br\/>What we have said with reference to the\u00a0 facts refers to Kennedy's\u00a0 trial.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is not necessary to discuss the facts with\u00a0 reference to Grant for\u00a0 the\u00a0 reason\u00a0 that he pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced under this plea. The defendants having agreed to commit this crime of illegal importation of the opium, morphine and cocaine, each was\u00a0 responsible for all the acts of the other defendant, or any\u00a0 agent\u00a0 of either\u00a0 of them,\u00a0 done in\u00a0 performance of the common purpose, and once this agreement\u00a0 or conspiracy existed between them it became immaterial whether the physical acts were done by Grant or\u00a0 Kennedy, since\u00a0 each was\u00a0 responsible for\u00a0 every\u00a0 act done in furtherance of the conspiracy.<br\/><br\/>It is urged that the court erred in attaching significance to the testimony that there had been a previous payment of a considerable amount of money by Kennedy to\u00a0 Grant.\u00a0\u00a0 We have said\u00a0 that some\u00a0 significance should be attached to this transaction.\u00a0 It will\u00a0 be noticed that this evidence was first opened up\u00a0 by the defendant himself in his cross-examination of Grant and was\u00a0 pursued without objection as long as\u00a0 he desired.\u00a0 The next time it\u00a0 is referred to is in the defendant's\u00a0 own\u00a0 testimony on\u00a0 direct examination.\u00a0 The defendant Kennedy himself is responsible for having\u00a0 injected this testimony into the record.<br\/><br\/>It is argued that the court erred in\u00a0 finding that the defendant .Kennedy\u00a0 waived his privilege\u00a0 of not testifying against himself.\u00a0\u00a0 Whatever may have been the defendant's motives in taking the stand he can not now complain inasmuch\u00a0 as he\u00a0 did so voluntarily in\u00a0 the\u00a0 exercise of a right which he had under the\u00a0 law.\u00a0 He was in the same position as any other person charged with the commission of a crime. He was given all opportunity to prepare his defense and was represented\u00a0 by able counsel.\u00a0 This disposes of the assignments\u00a0 of error which relate to the questions of fact. It is urged in support of the first assignment of error that section 2 of Act No. 612 is unconstitutional; first, because it is inconsistent\u00a0 with the laws on the same subject that apply\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 rest of the Philippine Islands; and, second, because it does not make any provision for the\u00a0 presence of an\u00a0 accused person, either by himself or by counsel, during the investigation held by the prosecuting attorney, thereby depriving the accused of his liberty without due process of law.\u00a0 The second assignment of error is necessarily involved in the\u00a0 first.<br\/><br\/>In determining\u00a0 whether or\u00a0 not\u00a0 this law is\u00a0 unconstitutional\u00a0 or repugnant to those provisions\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Philippine Bill which establish the rights of accused persons, we start out with the proposition that: \"Every statute is presumed to be constitutional.\u00a0\u00a0 The courts\u00a0 ought not\u00a0 to declare one to be unconstitutional, unless it is clearly so.\u00a0 If there is doubt, the expressed will of the legislature should be\u00a0 sustained.\" (Munn <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> Illinois, 94 U.

This\u00a0 certainly\u00a0 was process, and we must now determine whether it was \"due process of\u00a0 law.\" <br\/><br\/>Act No. 183, known as the Manila Charter, passed July 31,\u00a0 1901, created, among others, the law department.\u00a0 This department consists of the office of city\u00a0 attorney and the prosecuting attorney.\u00a0 Section 39 of this Act provides that the prosecuting attorney shall investigate all charges\u00a0 of crimes, misdemeanors,\u00a0 and violations\u00a0 of\u00a0 ordinances, and prepare the necessary informations, or make the necessary complaints against the persons accused.\u00a0 This\u00a0 section further provides that\u00a0 the prosecuting attorney, or any of his assistants, may, if\u00a0 he deems it wise, conduct an\u00a0 investigation in respect to\u00a0 crimes, misdemeanors,\u00a0 and violations of ordinances by\u00a0 taking oral evidence of reputed witnesses, and for this\u00a0 purpose may, by subpoena, summon witnesses to appear and testify under oath before\u00a0 him,\u00a0 and the attendance of such witnesses may be enforced by application to the\u00a0 court.\u00a0\u00a0 This section, as amended by section 2 of Act No. 612, makes such investigation made by the\u00a0 prosecuting attorney sufficient, and says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The defendant\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 shall not be entitled as\u00a0 of right to a preliminary examination in any case where the prosecuting attorney has made such investigation of the facts;\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\"<\/blockquote>The\u00a0 prosecuting attorney and his assistants are appointed by the Governor-General, with the advice and consent\u00a0 of the Philippine Commission, and their salaries are specifically and definitely\u00a0 fixed by law.\u00a0 No officer or employee\u00a0 of the office of the prosecuting attorney receives his compensation\u00a0 by way of\u00a0 fees,\u00a0 but all have\u00a0 fixed salaries.\u00a0\u00a0 The office of prosecuting attorney, taking into consideration the fact that Manila is a cosmopolitan town with a population of over 220,000, is of great importance.\u00a0 The\u00a0 prosecuting attorney and his assistants are presumed to be men learned in the law, of a high character, and to perform\u00a0 their duties impartially and with but\u00a0 one\u00a0 object in view, that being that justice may be meted out to all violators of\u00a0 the law and that no innocent man be punished.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no reason why any of\u00a0 these officials should present frivolous and unfounded complaints, but there is every reason\u00a0 to presume that a thorough investigation into the facts will be and is made before\u00a0 an information is presented, charging\u00a0 any person with a serious crime as their official or professional standing as officers of the court and\u00a0 servants\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Government would not be enhanced by a large number of acquittals. The same Act (No. 183) created a municipal court and a justice of\u00a0 the peace court for the city of Manila.\u00a0\u00a0 Both of these courts have power to issue warrants of arrest and to hold preliminary examinations for any offense\u00a0 without regard to the limits of punishment, and may release,\u00a0 commit,\u00a0 and bind over\u00a0 any person charged\u00a0 with\u00a0 such offense to secure his appearance before the\u00a0 proper\u00a0 court.\u00a0 The justice of the peace has no other criminal jurisdiction and the municipal judge has no civil\u00a0 jurisdiction, except for forfeiture and collection of bonds given in cases\u00a0 or proceedings\u00a0 pending in that\u00a0 court.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is not, says the\u00a0 law, within the power of the defendant in the municipal court, in a\u00a0 case triable\u00a0 in that court, to demand a\u00a0 preliminary examination, except a summary one,\u00a0 the extent of which shall\u00a0 be within the\u00a0 discretion\u00a0 of the\u00a0 court, to enable the court to fix the amount of bail.\u00a0\u00a0 Both the municipal judge and the justice of the peace are appointed by the Governor-General and\u00a0 have fixed salaries.\u00a0 The justices of the peace outside the\u00a0 city of\u00a0 Manila have both civil and criminal jurisdiction; they also have power to issue warrants of arrest and to conduct preliminary examinations in the same manner as the justice of the peace in\u00a0 the city of\u00a0 Manila. They receive fees for their services and the amount\u00a0 of\u00a0 such fees depends upon the number of cases tried and the number of preliminary examinations held.\u00a0\u00a0 Preliminary examinations conducted by the municipal judge and justice of the peace in\u00a0 the city of Manila, and also those conducted by justices of the peace outside the city, are necessarily held in the presence\u00a0 of the accused, who has a\u00a0 right under the law governing these examinations to be heard by himself and by counsel\u00a0 and to present witnesses\u00a0 on his\u00a0 own behalf.\u00a0 When the accused is committed or bound\u00a0 over to the Court of First Instance he can be, and generally is, placed upon trial without any further inquiry.\u00a0\u00a0 There are two steps in these preliminary proceedings; first, an\u00a0 inquiry to determine whether or not the warrant of arrest should issue; and, second, the preliminary examination which takes place after the accused person is apprehended by virtue of the order of arrest and brought before the court; while, we might say that, under the provisions of section 39 of Act No. 183, as amended by section 2 of Act No. 612, there is only one step in the proceedings; that is, the prosecuting attorney, after\u00a0 an investigation\u00a0 into the facts as required by law, files his complaint in the Court of First Instance, and upon\u00a0 this complaint alone the warrant can be issued, the accused arrested, brought into court,\u00a0 and placed upon trial, without any further investigation being\u00a0 made.\u00a0\u00a0 In the first class of cases\u00a0 section 3265 of the Compiled Laws of the Commission provides\u00a0 that:<br\/><blockquote>\"It shall be the duty of every justice of the peace (and this applies with equal\u00a0 force to the municipal judge in the city of Manila)\u00a0 when a written complaint, under oath,\u00a0 has been made to him that\u00a0 a crime has been committed within his municipality,\u00a0 and there\u00a0 is reason to believe that\u00a0 any person has committed the same, which complaint the justice believes to be well-founded, or when he has knowledge of facts tending to show the commission of the crime, to issue an order for the arrest of the person charged.\"<\/blockquote>While in the second class of cases the judge of the Court of First Instance can issue\u00a0 the\u00a0 warrant\u00a0 upon the sworn complaint\u00a0 of the prosecuting attorney.\u00a0\u00a0 Not only does\u00a0 the prosecuting attorney swear to the best of his\u00a0 information and\u00a0 belief that the allegations in the complaint are true, but he\u00a0 also swears that\u00a0 he\u00a0 has\u00a0 examined into the\u00a0 facts of the\u00a0 case by\u00a0 taking\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony of witnesses under oath.\u00a0\u00a0 There\u00a0 can' certainly be no objection to this procedure adopted\u00a0 for the municipal\u00a0 and justice of\u00a0 the peace courts.\u00a0\u00a0 Supposing that\u00a0 the\u00a0 procedure followed\u00a0 by\u00a0 the prosecuting attorney in\u00a0 the case\u00a0 at bar was had\u00a0 for\u00a0 the purpose of securing the order of arrest only, then it could not be\u00a0 seriously contended that\u00a0 it\u00a0 did not comply with that part of the Philippine Bill\u00a0 which provides that: \"No warrant shall issue\u00a0 but upon probable cause\u00a0 supported by oath or affirmation.\"\u00a0 As to what constitutes probable cause\u00a0 is a judicial question\u00a0 and\u00a0 must\u00a0 be determined by the\u00a0 judge\u00a0 or justice\u00a0 of the peace\u00a0 issuing the\u00a0 warrant.

It is frequently essential that such investigations\u00a0 be\u00a0 kept secret and that the accused should have no suspicion of any complaint against him, otherwise he might avoid\u00a0 punishment for his crime by escaping before arrest.<br\/><br\/>The objection most strongly\u00a0 urged to section 2 of Act No. 612 is that it deprived the defendant\u00a0 of his right\u00a0 to be present by himself and counsel and to present witnesses in his own behalf during' the investigation into the facts made by the prosecuting attorney.<br\/><br\/>The object or purpose of a\u00a0 preliminary investigation,\u00a0 or a previous inquiry of some kind, before an\u00a0 accused person is placed upon trial, is to secure the innocent against hasty, malicious, and oppressive prosecutions, and to protect him from\u00a0 an open and public accusation of crime,\u00a0 from the trouble, expense, and anxiety\u00a0 of a public trial, and also\u00a0 to protect the State from useless and expensive trials.<br\/><br\/>This court\u00a0 has\u00a0 held in the case of\u00a0 United\u00a0 States <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span>.

and the only difference between these examinations and that held by the acting prosecuting attorney in the case at bar, is that the law conferring power\u00a0 upon the prosecuting attorney to hold such investigation makes no provision that the same shall be held in the presence of the accused, nor does this law specifically give the accused the right to be heard, either by himself or counsel,\u00a0 nor to present witnesses in his\u00a0 own behalf.\u00a0 We, therefore,\u00a0 realize that section 2 of Act No. 612, amending section\u00a0 39 of Act No. 183, is not exactly the same as the constitution\u00a0 and penal\u00a0 code\u00a0 of the State of\u00a0 California, in that section 2 of Act No. 612 does not give the accused the right to be present\u00a0 and to be heard\u00a0 during\u00a0 such investigations.\u00a0 The proceedings\u00a0 before a\u00a0 grand jury\u00a0 in\u00a0 the absence of the accused is due process of law. A preliminary examination held by a justice of the peace in the presence of the accused and with the right to be heard is likewise due process of law.\u00a0 Justices of the peace,\u00a0 as a rule, are not men versed in\u00a0 the law.\u00a0 One\u00a0 is appointed for each municipality for the convenience of\u00a0 the people.\u00a0 They are\u00a0 not furnished\u00a0 with\u00a0 clerks,\u00a0 stenographers,\u00a0\u00a0 nor\u00a0 interpreters, neither do they have, in a great majority of the cases before them, the\u00a0 assistance of attorneys.\u00a0 They are not required to reduce to writing the testimony of witnesses in preliminary examinations, except that of the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 when\u00a0 he testifies in his\u00a0 own behalf.\u00a0 In these preliminary examinations the accused is\u00a0 charged with a\u00a0 certain crime and for this he is called upon\u00a0 to answer.\u00a0 But when the record reaches the Court of First Instance the\u00a0 prosecuting officer can and\u00a0 does frequently charge him with the commission of a different and more serious crime.\u00a0\u00a0 So it will be seen that from\u00a0 the\u00a0 very nature of these proceedings\u00a0 such\u00a0 examinations do\u00a0 not partake of the solemn formalities of a regular trial.\u00a0\u00a0 Justice of the peace courts are not\u00a0 courts of record.\u00a0\u00a0 The prosecuting attorney and\u00a0 his&gt; assistants are lawyers; they are equipped with all the necessary machinery to enable them to make a thorough investigation into the facts in every case before filing a complaint.\u00a0 If they are not satisfied that they have a reasonably sure chance of securing a conviction they do not enter court.\u00a0\u00a0 They act in a\u00a0 quasi-judicial capacity.\u00a0\u00a0 Their\u00a0 procedure\u00a0 is\u00a0 speedy and free from technicalities.\u00a0\u00a0 There\u00a0 is\u00a0 no reason to presume\u00a0 that every accused has not been given a \"square deal,\" and when he gets this he certainly has no right to complain. Between the examinations held\u00a0 by justices of the\u00a0 peace and those investigations made by the prosecuting attorney, the latter appear to be more thorough and preferable to all concerned.<br\/><br\/>The phrase \"due process of law,\" used in the Philippine Bill,\u00a0 should receive\u00a0 a comprehensive\u00a0 interpretation, and no procedure should be treated as unconstitutional which makes due\u00a0 provision for the trial\u00a0 of the criminal\u00a0 before a court\u00a0 of competent\u00a0 jurisdiction,\u00a0 for bringing\u00a0 the party against whom the proceeding is had into court, and notifying him of the case he is required to meet, for giving him an opportunity to be heard in his defense; for the deliberation and judgment\u00a0 of the court, and for an\u00a0 appeal from that judgment to the highest tribunal of the State for hearing and judgment\u00a0 there,\u00a0 (Hurtado <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span>.

Illinois, supra.)\u00a0\u00a0 But it might be insisted that this\" law does apply with equal force to the inhabitants of Manila, inasmuch as it might be said that it is within the\u00a0 power of individuals whether accused persons shall be brought under this law or\u00a0 not.\u00a0\u00a0 If a complaint, charging a person with a felony be filed directly in the Court of First Instance (and this can be done in Manila), the judge could either\u00a0 hold\u00a0 the preliminary\u00a0 investigation himself, send it\u00a0 to the prosecuting attorney for this purpose, or\u00a0 to the justice of the peace or municipal judge.\u00a0 By so doing, it is insisted that he would deprive even the people of Manila\u00a0 of the equal protection of the laws.\u00a0 The same might be\u00a0 said with reference to inhabitants outside the city\u00a0 of Manila, inasmuch as if a complaint should be filed (which can be done) in the Court of First Instance in any province, the judge could\u00a0 either conduct the preliminary investigation himself or send it to a justice\u00a0 of the peace for this\u00a0 purpose.\u00a0\u00a0 This is a mere question of procedure and we can not see in what way it could affect the\u00a0 substantial rights of a person charged with a crime.<br\/><br\/>Section 39 of\u00a0 Act No. 183 is a general statute.\u00a0 It defines the\u00a0 powers\u00a0 and duties of the\u00a0 prosecuting\u00a0 attorney.\u00a0 It affects all persons alike.\u00a0 A general statute is defined to be one which affects all the people, or all of a particular class. When it concerns a class in distinction from individuals, it is treated as general.\u00a0 A private or special statute (and these words appear to be used interchangeably) is one which affects only particular individuals or things.\u00a0 (Bish.

U. S. (172 U. S., 434), relied upon\u00a0 by the defendant Kennedy, the opinion is devoted principally to an interpretation of section 2865 of the Revised\u00a0 Statutes of the United States, and to defining the crime\u00a0 of smuggling;\u00a0 and\u00a0 it was there held that\u00a0 where the illegal shipment is seized before landing the said section was not violated.\u00a0 In\u00a0 this decision, section 3082 is referred to because one of the three\u00a0 counts\u00a0 in the indictment against Keck was\u00a0 drawn under this section. There can be no doubt that this section 355\u00a0 [341],\u00a0 supra, contains all the essential\u00a0 elements, of the crime\u00a0 charged and\u00a0 it is\u00a0 obvious that the complaint follows\u00a0 substantially the language of this statute.<br\/><blockquote>\"A complaint will be sufficient if it\u00a0 describes the offense in the language of the statute whenever the statute contains all the\u00a0 essential elements constituting the particular offense.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (U.

On this point Judge Cooley says in his work on\u00a0 Constitutional Limitations, 7th ed.,\u00a0 576:<br\/><blockquote>\"The law creates courts, and upon consideration of general\u00a0 policy defines\u00a0 and limits their jurisdiction; and\u00a0 this can neither be enlarged\u00a0 nor restricted by the act of the parties.\u00a0 Accordingly where a court by law has\u00a0 no jurisdiction of\u00a0 the\u00a0 subject-matter of\u00a0 a controversy, a party whose rights are sought\u00a0 to be affected by it is at liberty to\u00a0 repudiate\u00a0 its proceedings and\u00a0 refuse\u00a0 to be bound\u00a0 by them, notwithstanding he may once have consented to\u00a0 its action either by voluntarily commencing the proceeding as plaintiff or as defendant\u00a0 by appearing and pleading to the merits, or by any other\u00a0 formal or informal action.\u00a0 This right he may avail himself of at any stage of the case; and the maxim\u00a0 that requires\u00a0 one to move promptly who would take advantage of an irregularity does not apply here, since this is not mere irregular action, but a total want of power to act at all.\u00a0 Consent is sometimes implied from failure to object but there can be no waiver\u00a0 of rights by laches in a case where\u00a0 consent would be altogether nugatory.\"<\/blockquote>Prior to\u00a0 the\u00a0 passage of Act No. 1773 we\u00a0 had in this country certain crimes known as\u00a0 \"private crimes.\"\u00a0 The right to prosecute these crimes was conferred upon certain persons specifically named in the law.\u00a0\u00a0 This court has constantly held that when these crimes were not prosecuted at the instance of the persons authorized to do so, the whole proceedings were\u00a0 null and void for lack of jurisdiction\u00a0 of the subject-matter, and that this question can be raised at any time.\u00a0\u00a0 This court, upon its motion, has dismissed such proceedings in cases\u00a0 where the question was never raised by\u00a0 the parties.\u00a0 This proposition is too well settled to require the citation\u00a0 of authorities to\u00a0 support it.<br\/><br\/>So\u00a0 a careful examination of the law upon the question raised in\u00a0 this first assignment of error should be made.<br\/><br\/>Section 39 of Act No. 183 provides that the prosecuting attorney\u00a0 of the city of Manila shall have charge\u00a0 of the prosecution\u00a0 of all crimes, misdemeanors, and violations\u00a0 of city ordinances\u00a0 in the Court of\u00a0 First Instance\u00a0 and the municipal court of the city of Manila.\u00a0 The illegal\u00a0 importation of merchandise into the port of Manila and the landing of the same\u00a0 in the city is a crime committed within the city limits, and it would appear that the prosecuting attorney was the proper officer to prosecute the defendants,\u00a0 unless other subsequent provisions were made.<br\/><br\/>In Act No. 355, the Philippine Customs Administrative Act, under chapter 23, entitled \"Protests and Appeals,\" a court of customs appeals\u00a0 was organized\u00a0 (sec. 289), with certain well-defined duties\u00a0 and powers;\u00a0 but primarily to entertain appeals, from decisions of the Insular Collector (sec. 290), and in cases where the penalty of imprisonment should be\u00a0 imposed, to entertain proceedings\u00a0 instituted by the Attorney-General\u00a0 in the nature of and with procedure similar to ordinary criminal proceedings (sec. 291).\u00a0 Under chapter\u00a0 25, entitled \"Searches\u00a0 and\u00a0 Seizures,\" there is a further provision that if a fine,\u00a0 forfeiture, or penalty can not be collected by the respective collectors, either from lack of statutory authority or because no property was held by them under a lien which could be enforced in any way but by suit or\u00a0 criminal prosecution,\u00a0 then in such case the facts should be reported to\u00a0 the proper prosecuting\u00a0 officer of the district (sec. 344).\u00a0 The duty of such officer\u00a0 was then to institute proceedings for such collection\u00a0 (sec.\u00a0 345).\u00a0\u00a0 It is to be noticed that no particular court was designated in which the\u00a0 prosecuting officer was to enforce collection.<br\/><br\/>Subsequently, Act No. 653 amended this method of collection by providing that the reports of such uncollectible fines, forfeitures, or penalties should be made to the\u00a0 Insular Collector\u00a0 who should\u00a0 institute proceedings\u00a0 in the Court\u00a0 of Customs\u00a0 Appeals\u00a0 (sees. 1\u00a0 and\u00a0 2).\u00a0 There is nothing\u00a0 so far intimating that a criminal prosecution for violation of the Customs Act could not be instituted and carried\u00a0 on in the Court of First Instance like other crimes.\u00a0 This jurisdiction of\u00a0 the Court of First Instance is\u00a0 recognized and reaffirmed in an Act extending the powers of the Court of Customs Appeals.\u00a0\u00a0 Act No. 864, section 4, repealed sections 290 and 291 of the original Act, as amended by sections 1 and 2 of Act No. 653, and provided as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Sections two hundred and ninety and two hundred and ninety-one of the Customs Administrative Act are hereby repealed, and in lieu thereof the following is substituted:<br\/><br\/>\"'Sec. 290 The Court of Customs Appeals shall\u00a0 have jurisdiction concurrent\u00a0 with that of the Courts of First Instance to consider all\u00a0 criminal prosecutions begun under this Act and under the immigration laws of the Philippine Islands, including the\u00a0 Act\u00a0 of\u00a0 Congress approved March third, nineteen hundred and three, entitled \"An\u00a0 Act to regulate the immigration of aliens into the United States,\" and the Chinese\u00a0 Exclusion\u00a0 Acts, and under the customs and navigation laws;

In Act No. 1405, section $, after reciting the jurisdiction of the court, there is the following clause: \"Its\u00a0 procedure in such (criminal)\u00a0 cases shall be\u00a0 the same as in\u00a0 other criminal cases in the Courts of First Instance.\"\u00a0 Act No. 1405, section 8, amends Act No. 864, section 7,\u00a0 simply by striking out the words\u00a0 \"in the Court of Customs Appeals\" and\u00a0 inserting\u00a0 in their\u00a0 place \"in the\u00a0 Court of First Instance for the city of Manila.\"<br\/><br\/>It therefore follows that a criminal prosecution for violation of the Customs Administrative Act may be instituted in the\u00a0 Court\u00a0 of First\u00a0 Instance\u00a0 of\u00a0 Manila in two ways: (1) By report to the Attorney-General through the Insular Collector\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 manner provided\u00a0 for the old\u00a0 Customs Court;\u00a0 and\u00a0 (2) by report of the facts by the Collector to the proper prosecuting\u00a0 officer for prosecution in\u00a0 the Court of First Instance in the usual manner.\u00a0 It is not disputed that this case was reported by the Collector to the prosecuting attorney for\u00a0 the city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>On arraignment, the defendant Grant entered a plea of guilty.\u00a0 His counsel\u00a0 then asked\u00a0 the\u00a0 court \"for an opportunity to be heard for a consideration of the circumstances, which the defense considers have a bearing upon the penalty to be imposed.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Judgment was suspended\u00a0 and the\u00a0 trial of Kennedy commenced.\u00a0 Kennedy was sentenced on\u00a0 October 25,1909.\u00a0\u00a0 Grant filed, on October 22, a motion asking leave of the court\u00a0 to\u00a0 withdraw his plea\u00a0 of guilty\u00a0 and substitute in lieu thereof a plea of not guilty.\u00a0 This motion was opposed by the prosecuting attorney and denied by the court.\u00a0\u00a0 It is now urged that the denial of this motion was an abuse of discretion\u00a0 and\u00a0 that\u00a0 this abuse constitutes an error of law.\u00a0 In support of this alleged error counsel for the defendant said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is well known that an application for\u00a0 permission to substitute a plea of 'not guilty' for that of\u00a0 'guilty,' when the latter has\u00a0 been\u00a0 once entered is\u00a0 addressed to the discretion of the trial court.\u00a0 Nevertheless that discretion is one for judicial exercise, and an abuse thereof constitutes error of law.\u00a0\u00a0 In the present case the denial by the court of the permission to make the desired substitution of pleas has deprived\u00a0 the appellant of the opportunity for a fair and just trial of this cause upon its merits.\u00a0\u00a0 It has deprived him of the right to be\u00a0 present at his own trial.\u00a0 It has deprived him of the right\u00a0 to confront the witnesses who testified to his guilt and to\u00a0 subject said witnesses to cross-examination.\u00a0\u00a0 It has deprived him of the\u00a0 right to refuse to testify as to his own guilt.\u00a0 It has deprived him of the right to\u00a0 except to errors of the trial court and to submit those errors for review upon appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 It has accomplished those things by refusing to permit the appellant to\u00a0 withdraw a plea entered into under a\u00a0 misapprehension of its effect, and\u00a0 in\u00a0 reliance upon an express agreement with the prosecuting attorney.\u00a0\u00a0 This agreement the prosecuting attorney was\u00a0 permitted to repudiate in\u00a0 toto\u00a0 without\u00a0 restoring the appellant\u00a0 to the status\u00a0 which was lawfully and justly\u00a0 his in the absence of such an agreement.\"<\/blockquote>When\u00a0 the court denied this motion it had already tried and sentenced\u00a0 the defendant Kennedy and had before\u00a0 it Exhibit A which was presented by the prosecuting attorney without objection.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 Exhibit\u00a0 A\u00a0 is a part\u00a0 of Grant's testimony in the case against Kennedy in which he, Grant, testified on\u00a0 the question\u00a0 of\u00a0 the agreement with the prosecuting attorney as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Now Mr. Grant have you\u00a0 been made any promises to testify in this case?\u00a0 If so state to the\u00a0 court what?\u2014<br\/><br\/>A.

No, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Wasn't it arranged that no penalty by way of imprisonment should\u00a0 be imposed\u00a0 upon\u00a0 you if you pleaded guilty?\u2014A.

Well, I did not understand that there was any specific arrangement\u2014 that there\u00a0 could not be any specific arrangement, that the court would simply take my plea of guilty into consideration in passing\u00a0 sentence.\"<\/blockquote>Not only did the court have this part\u00a0 of Grant's testimony before it in passing upon defendant's motion, but it had heard\u00a0 all the testimony\u00a0 of the witnesses presented at the trial of Kennedy, including that of the defendant Grant, wherein\u00a0 he openly,\u00a0 freely and in\u00a0 detail admitted his guilt. Such testimony was not necessary to establish Grant's guilt. This he had admitted in his plea;\u00a0 but\u00a0 the court could take into consideration all of these facts and circumstances in determining whether or not\u00a0 Grant should\u00a0 be\u00a0 allowed to withdraw his\u00a0 plea of guilty\u00a0 and substitute in\u00a0 lieu thereof a plea of not guilty.\u00a0 The basis of this motion which was filed in the court below is an alleged agreement which the defendant had with the\u00a0 prosecuting attorney,\u00a0 in\u00a0 consideration\u00a0 of. his entering a plea of guilty.\u00a0 According to this motion at the time\u00a0 Grant entered his\u00a0 plea of guilty there existed between him and the prosecuting attorney an agreement whereby it\u00a0 was mutually stipulated and agreed that for and\u00a0 in\u00a0 consideration of this\u00a0 plea of guilty, and\u00a0 for and in consideration\u00a0 of the unreserved\u00a0 and unqualified cooperation of the defendant\u00a0 in\u00a0 the prosecution\u00a0 of this cause,\u00a0 the prosecuting attorney would unqualifiedly recommend to the court that the punishment to be inflicted upon this defendant be limited\u00a0 to a\u00a0 moderate\u00a0 fine.\u00a0 It is further stated in this motion that at the trial of this case (Kennedy's) the defendant Grant was a witness to his own guilt, and that the prosecuting\u00a0 attorney, after Grant had entered his plea of guilty\u00a0 and after he\u00a0 had testified as a witness for the prosecution\u00a0 in the case against\u00a0 Kennedy, declined to carry out that\u00a0 agreement by refusing to\u00a0 make such\u00a0 recommendations to the court.\u00a0 In reply to\u00a0 these allegations in\u00a0 this motion the prosecuting attorney said;<br\/><blockquote>\"That the plea of guilty was entered by the accused herein deliberately, under the guidance and advice of his counsel, after having been fully advised in open court that the court declined to recognize or be bound by any agreement that he might\u00a0 have made with the prosecuting attorney,\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"That the determination\u00a0 and cancellation of\u00a0 the agreement and arrangement under which the said accused,\u00a0 Louis T. Grant,\u00a0 entered his plea of guilt was by\u00a0 his own act and self-confessed\u00a0 perjury and failure\u00a0 to give the prosecuting attorney his 'unreserved and unqualified cooperation' in the prosecution of his codefendant, Kennedy.\u00a0 But should this court esteem that the said Louis T.\u00a0 Grant,\u00a0 accused, has not by such acts and failure on his part to carry out said agreement released the prosecuting attorney\u00a0 from\u00a0 obligation thereunder, then\u00a0 the court\u00a0 has full power to give\u00a0 the accused the full\u00a0 benefit of said agreement under his\u00a0 plea of guilty herein, and impose punishment upon the said accused in accordance with said agreement, in which case the accused would\u00a0 not be prejudiced.\"<\/blockquote>So the prosecuting attorney did, in fact,\u00a0 enter into a certain agreement with counsel for the defendant with reference to his entering a\u00a0 plea of\u00a0 guilty and assisting\u00a0 the prosecution.\u00a0\u00a0 The prosecuting attorney does not\u00a0 say\u00a0 what this agreement was.\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the defense says that the prosecuting attorney\u00a0 agreed to recommend that\u00a0 the\u00a0 court impose a\u00a0 moderate fine only; while the defendant himself testifies that\u00a0 he was\u00a0 told\u00a0 that\u00a0 the prosecuting\u00a0 attorney would recommend\u00a0 that the court take\u00a0 into consideration his plea\u00a0 of guilty\u00a0 and the fact that he testified\u00a0 for\u00a0 the prosecution against Kennedy.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 further testified that he was told that the court declined\u00a0 to be bound by any agreement\u00a0 and that\u00a0 he did not understand\u00a0 that there was to be any specific amelioration of penalty in his case.\u00a0\u00a0 Grant failed to carry\u00a0 out his\u00a0 agreement with\u00a0 the prosecuting attorney\u00a0 and for this reason the\u00a0 prosecuting attorney\u00a0 declined to\u00a0 make any\u00a0 recommendation.\u00a0 Before Grant entered\u00a0 this\u00a0 plea\u00a0 he was\u00a0 given to understand\u00a0 that the court\u00a0 would not be bound by any agreement and after this understanding\u00a0 he, upon the advice of able\u00a0 counsel, entered his\u00a0 plea of guilty and in his testimony confessed his guilt.<br\/><br\/>A voluntary plea of guilty\u00a0 is a confession of guilt, and the court\u00a0 must accept the plea and pronounce the proper judgment and\u00a0 sentence.\u00a0\u00a0 On\u00a0 entering such a\u00a0 plea an accused' person waives those rights and privileges set forth in the statement of counsel heretofore copied.<br\/><blockquote>\"It is wholly in\u00a0 the discretion of the court whether a plea\u00a0 of any sort\u00a0 may be withdrawn.\u00a0 Permission\u00a0 may always be granted, but\u00a0 unless an\u00a0 abuse of discretion is shown the refusal of permission to withdraw a plea is not error.\" (12 Cyc, 350.)\u00a0\u00a0 \"But abuse of discretion in refusing to allow his plea of guilty to be withdrawn\u00a0 is reversible error.\"\u00a0 (12 Cyc, 352.)<\/blockquote>Did the trial court abuse its\u00a0 discretion\u00a0 in\u00a0 refusing to allow the defendant\u00a0 to withdraw his\u00a0 plea\u00a0 of guilty and substitute therefor\u00a0 a\u00a0 plea of not guilty? We\u00a0 think it did not.\u00a0 Before this plea was entered the defendant was represented\u00a0 by able counsel and\u00a0 he had full\u00a0 opportunity to consult with them.<br\/><br\/>In the case of State <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span>. Yates\u00a0 (52 Kan.,\u00a0 566), an information was filed against Yates charging him in several different counts with\u00a0 having violated the liquor law in his drug\u00a0 store in the city of Hiawatha.\u00a0 Subsequently thereto the county attorney filed an amended information charging Yates with keeping a\u00a0 place\u00a0 wherein intoxicating liquors were received and kept for the purpose of use as a beverage.\u00a0 To this amended complaint Yates pleaded guilty.\u00a0 He was thereupon sentenced to pay a fine of $300 U. S. currency and costs and to be committed\u00a0 to jail until the fine and costs were paid.\u00a0 Yates presented a motion to set aside his plea of guilty, alleging that he was induced to\u00a0 plead guilty upon promise of the county attorney that only\u00a0 a fino of $100 U. S. currency, would be imposed.\u00a0 This motion was denied and Yates\u00a0 appealed.\u00a0 The plea of\u00a0 guilty was not entered because of\u00a0 anything said\u00a0 or done by the trial judge.\u00a0 The court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"We\u00a0 can not perceive from\u00a0 a careful reading of the evidence that the county attorney acted\u00a0 in bad\u00a0 faith in any way toward\u00a0 the defendant; nor was the trial court under any duty to inflict the minimum sentence permitted by the statute\u00a0 by anything said or done by the county attorney.\"<\/blockquote>The judgment was affirmed.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 Neeley's case (27\u00a0 Texas Criminal Appeals, 324), the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Having violated his agreement to\u00a0 testify\u00a0 in behalf of the State, the defendant was not\u00a0 entitled to\u00a0 exemption from prosecution by virtue of said agreement.\u00a0\u00a0 It is well settled that where a particeps criminis, for the purpose of securing exemption from prosecution,\u00a0 agrees\u00a0 to\u00a0 testify in behalf of the State against. his accomplice in crime, and violates\u00a0 such agreement by; refusing\u00a0 to testify, in\u00a0 good faith, fairly\u00a0 and fully to facts within his\u00a0 knowledge,\u00a0 he can not claim the benefit of such agreement and may be prosecuted and convicted, regardless thereof.\"\u00a0 (Citing\u00a0 Bish.

State, 36 Ind., 406; Commonwealth <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span>. Winton, 108 Mass., 485.) The mere fact that the punishment which Grant received is greater than he expected (Mastronada <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span>. State, 60 Miss., 86), or that the prosecution\u00a0 proved aggravating\u00a0 circumstances (Mounts <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span>. Commonwealth, 89\u00a0 Ken.,\u00a0 274) is not sufficient cause to require permission to withdraw his plea. In support of the third assignment of error it is\u00a0 insisted that, under the rule established by the law of criminal procedure in\u00a0 this jurisdiction, the calling of the defendant, am a witness, by the prosecution, as a matter of right, constitutes a discharge\u00a0 and an acquittal\u00a0 of the defendant so called.\u00a0\u00a0 In support of this proposition counsel cite the provisions of paragraph 3,\u00a0 section 5 of the\u00a0 Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, and sections 15,\u00a0 24, and 26 of General Orders, No. 58.\u00a0\u00a0 Section 5 of the Act of Congress\u00a0 of July 1,\u00a0 1902,\u00a0 provides that no person\u00a0 held\u00a0 to answer for a criminal offense shall be compelled\u00a0 to be a witness\u00a0 against himself.\u00a0 The same provision\u00a0 is contained in section 15 of General Orders No. 58.\u00a0\u00a0 Section 24 of this General Orders deals with the different kinds of pleas which\u00a0 may be entered by a defendant, one of\u00a0 which is that of guilty, and section 26 provides that when a defendant shall have been convicted, acquitted, or once\u00a0 placed in jeopardy upon\u00a0 an nformation or complaint, such act is a bar to another inormation or indictment for the same offense.\u00a0 So it will be seen that these two sections are hardly applicable to the question under consideration.<br\/><br\/>Sections 34, 35, and 36 of General Orders, No. 58 provide for the exclusion of a codefendant on\u00a0 application of the prosecuting attorney to be used as a witness for the prosecution, and also for the discharge of such codefendant when in the opinion of the court there\u00a0 is not sufficient evidence to put him upon his defense.\u00a0 When a defendant is excluded or discharged, the\u00a0 order excluding\u00a0 or discharging him shall amount to an acquittal and be a bar to a future prosecution for the same offense.\u00a0 Neither the provisions of the Philippine Bill, nor those of General Orders, No.\u00a0 58 prohibit the calling of a defendant to testify for the prosecution against his codefendants after he himself has entered a plea of\u00a0 guilty,\u00a0 when such defendant testifies of his\u00a0 own free will.\u00a0\u00a0 To hold that a defendant, after\u00a0 he has entered a plea of guilty and testified as a\u00a0 witness for the prosecution, must be discharged or acquitted would be placing the power in the hands of criminals to escape\u00a0 punishment\u00a0 by reason of their own acts.\u00a0\u00a0 It is perfectly legal to permit a defendant, after\u00a0 he has\u00a0 pleaded guilty,\u00a0 to\u00a0 testify\u00a0 against Wis\u00a0 codefendants.\u00a0\u00a0 (Authorities cited under ninth assignment of error of\u00a0 defendant Kennedy.)\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant Grant\u00a0 having voluntarily elected to enter a plea of guilty and then testify\u00a0 as a witness for the prosecution\u00a0 against his\u00a0 codefendant, can not now complain.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 two defendants, Kennedy and Grant, are intelligent men, with broad\u00a0 experience.\u00a0\u00a0 They well knew the\u00a0 gravity of the offense which they committed.\u00a0 They\u00a0 committed this crime after much planning and deliberation, and in doing so not\u00a0 only violated the Customs Act but brought into this country articles which unauthorized persons\u00a0 (such as the defendants in this case)\u00a0 are absolutely prohibited from having in their possession.\u00a0\u00a0 Section 31\u00a0 of\u00a0 Act\u00a0 No. 1761, known as\u00a0 the Opium Law, provides that any unauthorized person, owning, holding, having, controlling, having possession of, or knowingly having on his premises, any opium, cocaine, etc., on and after March 1, 1908, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding P10,000, or by imprisonment for not exceeding five years, or both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court.\u00a0 The very intention of the legislative body in enacting: this law was to rid this country of the deadly vice of opium smoking.\u00a0 So we think that, under all the facts and circumstances in this case, especially considering the\u00a0 enormous quantity of\u00a0 opium, morphine and cocaine which these two defendants\u00a0 brought into this country, strict justice requires a more severe penalty than that imposed by the court below.<br\/><br\/>We, therefore, modify the judgment and sentence of the lower court in so far as it imposes a penalty of one year's imprisonment on\u00a0 each of\u00a0 these\u00a0 defendants,\u00a0 and\u00a0 instead thereof we sentence each of the defendants herein,\u00a0 William Kennedy and Louis T, Grant, to two years' imprisonment. With this\u00a0 modification\u00a0 the\u00a0 judgment and\u00a0 sentence of the trial\u00a0 court is affirmed, with\u00a0 the costs of\u00a0 this instance against the appellants.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Arellano,\u00a0 C.\u00a0 J., Torres,\u00a0\u00a0 Johnson,\u00a0<\/span> and\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Moreland, JJ., <\/span>concur.<\/div>",

Eduarda Garen and Gelasio\u00a0 Disol filed a written complaint against Agapito Pilar, Fermin Domingo, Bruno Domingo,\u00a0 Angela Rosapa, and Jayme\u00a0 Pasion,\u00a0 alleging that\u00a0 the plaintiffs\u00a0 were\u00a0 the owners of two parcels of land with the respective areas of 20 hectares and 50 ares, and\u00a0 20 hectares 50 ares and\u00a0 6 centares; the first, which is situated\u00a0 in Nagrebcan, bounded on the north by property of Hermenegildo Dimaya and Lucas Nuque, on the east by that of Manuel Morales,\u00a0 on the south by that of Lucas Nuque\u00a0 and by a hill, and on\u00a0 the west by the\u00a0 land\u00a0 of the\u00a0 said\u00a0 Hermenegildo Dimaya and\u00a0 Lucas Nuque; and the second parcel bounded on the north by a hill and the land of Rita Aduana, on the east by an estuary and the land of Gabriel\u00a0 Maulit, on the south by. the property of Eleuterio\u00a0 Castro\u00a0 and by a\u00a0 hill, and\u00a0 on the\u00a0 west by that of Dimas Pambid and by a hill; that the said two parcels of land, used for the cultivation of rice and tobacco, had been in the possession\u00a0 of the plaintiffs, as the owners\u00a0 and proprietors thereof; that\u00a0 in March, 1908, the defendants, alleging a right of ownership,\u00a0 proceeded to plow\u00a0 the said land and to plant corn and destroyed the four thousand hills of corn which the plaintiffs had planted therein, paying no heed to the patter's repeated objections, thereby\u00a0 causing them damages to the extent of P40, an amount that they should have obtained from the corn which was destroyed.\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel therefore\u00a0 prayed that judgment be\u00a0 rendered\u00a0 decreeing: First, that the plaintiffs are the sole owners of the two parcels of land before described; second, that the defendants shall abstain in the future from exercising acts of ownership over the said property; and, third, that the said defendants shall pay to the plaintiffs P40 for losses\u00a0 and\u00a0 damages occasioned, and the\u00a0 costs.<br\/><br\/>Counsel\u00a0 for the defendants in their\u00a0 answer denied each and all of the points and each and all of the allegations set forth in\u00a0 the complaint, and as a special\u00a0 defense alleged that the plaintiffs' averment, contained in the second paragraph of\u00a0 the complaint, that\u00a0 they\u00a0 are the\u00a0 sole possessors and owners of the said land,\u00a0 was\u00a0 false, inasmuch as the defendants were\u00a0 coowners with\u00a0 the said plaintiffs and should occupy, and had been occupying for many years, each one of them a sixth part of the land in question, as\u00a0 they had all of them\u00a0 acquired the same by inheritance from their forefathers.\u00a0 It was further alleged in the said answer that the third paragraph of the complaint was false,\u00a0 inasmuch as the defendants had, for a very long period of time, possessed the portion of the said\u00a0 land that belonged to their ancestors and that they had been occupying the same, and continued to occupy it, up to the\u00a0 date of the complaint; that they had destroyed no crop whatever belonging to the plaintiffs,\u00a0 since they had never entered upon the part of the land situated in the southern\u00a0 district\u00a0 of\u00a0 Nagrebcan, nor\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 sixth portion thereof\u00a0 in the northern district of Cabaroan, it being strange that the plaintiffs, in describing the boundaries, in their complaint, of the whole of the property, should have included therein the part thereof which the defendants were then occupying; and that\u00a0 the conduct of the plaintiffs was inexplicable in prosecuting this suit, inasmuch as, on March 15, 1905,\u00a0 they filed, in the justice\u00a0 of the peace\u00a0 court of Batac, a civil action against Agapito Pilar, one of\u00a0 the defendants herein, for the unlawful detention of realty,\u00a0 the same\u00a0 now in litigation, and the case having been4aken to the Court of First Instance by appeal, the other defendants herein made a motion for intervention, and\u00a0 afterwards\u00a0 the said\u00a0 plaintiffs withdrew that suit\u00a0 and instituted another action, on January 7, 1907, against the said Agapito Pilar, concerning the ownership of the same land now in question, with prayer for the issuance of\u00a0 a\u00a0 final\u00a0 injunction, which suit was decided by the court in favor of the defendant who was absolved from the complaint,\u00a0 with the costs against\u00a0 the plaintiffs; that the latter took no appeal from that\u00a0 judgment and,\u00a0 consequently, the question now at\u00a0 issue had\u00a0 become <i>res adjudicata<\/i> The defendants therefore prayed that judgment be\u00a0 rendered acquitting them from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>The case having come to trial, oral evidence was adduced by both\u00a0 parties,\u00a0 the exhibits being\u00a0 attached to the record, and the\u00a0 court, on February 23,\u00a0 1909, rendered\u00a0 judgment wherein\u00a0 it declared that Eduarda Garen, together with her husband, Gelasio Disol, was the owner of\u00a0 the land\u00a0 described in Exhibits\u00a0 Nos. 1 and 2, and that\u00a0 she should take possession\u00a0 of the\u00a0 same after it had been\u00a0 surveyed by an expert surveyor for the purpose of a verification of the measurements\u00a0 specified in\u00a0 the\u00a0 said documents.\u00a0 No special finding was made as to the costs.\u00a0 Counsel\u00a0 for the defendants was notified of the said judgment, took an exception thereto and asked for its annulment and a new trial.\u00a0\u00a0 He also requested in advance,\u00a0 that\u00a0 his\u00a0 exception be\u00a0 recorded in case his petition should be denied, as in fact it was.\u00a0 A proper bill of exceptions was then filed, approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court, together with a transcript of the evidence.<br\/><br\/>By the institution of the proper action for the recovery of possession, the plaintiffs in\u00a0 this suit are endeavoring to regain control of two parcels of land alleged to belong to them and to be unlawfully detained by the defendants since March,\u00a0 1908.<br\/><br\/>For the purpose of establishing their right, the plaintiffs exhibited, as a title, an authorized copy of a possessory information obtained through the justice of the peace court of Banna, Ilocos Norte, at the instance of Apolinario Garen, the father of the plaintiff Eduarda Garen, which information was recorded in the property\u00a0 registry of the\u00a0 said province on June 3, 1895.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the fact that one of the defendants, Agapito Pilar, sued\u00a0 the said Apolinario Garen in the\u00a0 justice of the peace court of the pueblo before mentioned for the redelivery\u00a0 of the two\u00a0 parcels of land situated in Nagrebcan and Cabaroan and referred to in the complaint, the suit was\u00a0 decided favorably\u00a0 to\u00a0 the defendant Garen.\u00a0 It was ordered in the judgment that the latter should be protected in his possession of the said land, and that the plaintiff Pilar should\u00a0 forever refrain from further interference therein, and pay\u00a0 the costs.\u00a0\u00a0 This judgment, on being appealed\u00a0 by the plaintiff, was\u00a0 affirmed by the Court of First Instance by another judgment of the 29th of April, 1895, containing the clause\u00a0 \"without prejudice to such right of ownership as the appellant\u00a0 may have in\u00a0 the said property.\"\u00a0 A new suit was filed by\u00a0 the said Agapito Pilar against the present plaintiffs,\u00a0 Eduarda Garen\u00a0 and Gelasio\u00a0 Disol, in the justice of the peace court of\u00a0 the aforementioned pueblo,\u00a0 and\u00a0 judgment\u00a0 was rendered for\u00a0 the second time, on July 11, 1902,\u00a0 in favor of the defendants, Garen and Disol, whereby it was ordered that they should be protected in their\u00a0 possession\u00a0 of\u00a0 the said\u00a0 land, and\u00a0 the plaintiff Pilar was sentenced forever to refrain from further interference, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>So that\u00a0 it is incontrovertible that Eduarda Garen, the successor of her father, Apolinario Garen, is\u00a0 the sole possessor, as the legitimate owner, of the two parcels of land which are\u00a0 the subject\u00a0 of the action\u00a0 for recovery.\u00a0\u00a0 This is proved by\u00a0 the said\u00a0 possessory information recorded in the property registry.\u00a0 Her right\u00a0 of possession,\u00a0 as owner,\u00a0 is further confirmed by two final judgments, of\u00a0 an executory character, rendered in two suits which were prosecuted, one of them in\u00a0 two instances, by one of the defendants, Agapito Pilar.\u00a0 The fact was fully proved, even by the testimony of some of\u00a0 the witnesses for the defendants, that the latter themselves and for\u00a0 themselves took possession of the land, in March,\u00a0 1908, and continue to\u00a0 detain the\u00a0 same to the detriment of the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>The defendants allege that, together with\u00a0 the plaintiff, Eduarda Garen, they are coowners of the land in question, and\u00a0 that Apolinario Garen, Eduarda's father,\u00a0 personally obtained the said possessory information, by an\u00a0 agreement made with the other coowners who contributed their share of the expenses, though the names pf the latter were not expressed in the application, and that the said instrument was\u00a0 issued solely in the name of Apolinario Garen, in accordance with a written agreement which they affirm was retained by the latter.\u00a0 This assertion is incredible, because, if this written agreement\u00a0 was a security\u00a0 for the other coowners of the land, and the possessory information was obtained only by Apolinario Garen, the document expressive of such agreement\u00a0 should\u00a0 be held by those who\u00a0 were in need of insuring their rights; and, as such proof is lacking. the existence of the\u00a0 agreement can not be admitted.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the\u00a0 evidence adduced by the defendants in rebuttal of that of the plaintiffs, on its examination, as a whole, it is\u00a0 found that\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendants have\u00a0 not satisfactorily established\u00a0 their\u00a0 allegation\u00a0 that\u00a0 they\u00a0 are\u00a0 the coowners of the land in question; therefore the plaintiffs are entitled to recover possession of the property.<br\/><br\/>The withdrawal\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs,\u00a0 Eduarda Garen and husband, of the complaint for the restitution of possession, filed against Agapito Pilar, who had forcibly occupied the said land - a withdrawal which was allowed by order of the court of January 7,\u00a0 1907, under promise to file a new complaint (page 27\u00a0 of the record) - in no way affects the ownership rights of the plaintiffs and does not\u00a0 imply an acquiescence in and acceptance of the despoliation, notwithstanding\u00a0 the repeated\u00a0 final judgments which have supported the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 in their alleged right in the said land.<br\/><br\/>Neither have the plaintiffs lost their rights of ownership in the disputed property on\u00a0 account\u00a0 of the judgment of December 16, 1907, denying\u00a0 them the remedy of a permanent injunction against Agapito\u00a0 Pilar,\u00a0 solicited by the plaintiffs on January 7, 1907, on the occasion of the usurpation and despoliation before referred to, inasmuch as they could still prosecute an action for the recovery of possession, which\u00a0 they\u00a0 did\u00a0 do by\u00a0 initiating this suit.\u00a0 The basis of the action was not weakened by the other documents exhibited by the defendants.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the\u00a0 lack of proof of the coownership alleged by the defendants, the plaintiff party exhibited two affidavits in connection with the land tax.\u00a0 In one of them (page\u00a0 21 of the\u00a0 record)\u00a0 Gelasio Disol, the husband of Eduarda Garen, declared that he was the owner of a parcel of land of\u00a0 only\u00a0 6 hectares 13 ares\u00a0 and\u00a0 10 centares in area, situated in Cabaroan, and in the other affidavit (page 22 of the record)\u00a0 the same affiant likewise declared that he was the owner of a parcel of agricultural land in Nagrebcan of 2 hectares 13 ares and 75 centares\u00a0 in area.\u00a0 These two affidavits have served as a rectification of\u00a0 the area of the two parcels of land claimed in plaintiffs' complaint.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, in the judgment appealed from, Eduarda Garen was found to be the owner of the land described in Exhibits 1 and\u00a0 2 (pages 21 and 22 of the record), and it was ordered that she be given possession thereof, after\u00a0 a verification by an expert surveyor\u00a0 of the measurements expressed in the said documents, to which the plaintiffs made no objection whatever and\u00a0 consented to the said judgment, and the counsel who represented them asked for its affirmation in his brief presented in this second instance.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, it is\u00a0 proper,\u00a0 in our opinion, to affirm, and we do hereby affirm, the said\u00a0 judgment, with the costs of this instance against the appellant party.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

It will be\u00a0 thus\u00a0 observed that, at the time\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiff began\u00a0 to construct his fish trap and up\u00a0 to the 24th day of\u00a0 December aforesaid,\u00a0 he was acting in\u00a0 violation of the ordinances of the municipality, in that\u00a0 he had\u00a0 not yet obtained a license to construct or to begin the construction of\u00a0 a fish trap.\u00a0 Moreover, even though he had had a license, he\u00a0 was still violating the ordinances of the village in that he was\u00a0 constructing his trap\u00a0 within\u00a0 150 feet of the defendant's.\u00a0 It\u00a0 appears further that\u00a0 at the time the defendant\u00a0 had completed\u00a0 his fish\u00a0 trap, the\u00a0 plaintiff had received no license to construct one.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, every act he performed in the construction of his trap was in violation of the law and he could, accordingly, acquire no rights against the municipality or against the defendant by such acts.<br\/><br\/>From the facts proved it appears that the defendant took no part directly\u00a0 or indirectly in the removing of plaintiff's fish trap.\u00a0 That was done by the\u00a0 municipal\u00a0 police under the directions of the municipality.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 was present at the time\u00a0 the\u00a0 removal was effected, but, so\u00a0 far as\u00a0 appears from the record, took no part therein and gave no directions in relation thereto.<br\/><br\/>The learned trial\u00a0 court upon\u00a0 the trial found in favor of\u00a0 the plaintiff,\u00a0 awarding\u00a0 him\u00a0 a judgment against\u00a0 the defendant\u00a0 for\u00a0 damages in the\u00a0 sum of P400,\u00a0 with interest thereon from the date of the presentation of the complaint. From the facts already presented, and the reasons above expressed,\u00a0 we are of the opinion that the judgment of\u00a0 the learned trial\u00a0 court must be reversed\u00a0 and the defendant absolved from liability in relation\u00a0 to the facts set out in plaintiff's complaint.<br\/><br\/>The judgment\u00a0 of the court below\u00a0 is accordingly reversed, without special finding as to costs.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Arellano, C.\u00a0 J., Torres, Johnson,\u00a0<\/span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Trent, JJ., <\/span>concur.<\/div>",

that he saw the defendant give Tapic <i>tuba<\/i> to drink and a bolo and heard him say to him:\u00a0 \"Serapio, in this moment you\u00a0 have to comply with what I have ordered you to do.\"<br\/><br\/>Benito Sabalando, another witness for the prosecution, stated that he was in partnership with\u00a0 Antonio Gavato in the cockpit at Malolos and was in said cockpit on the 30th of May when Tapic entered and wounded Laoronilla; that after Tapic had wounded Laoronilla and was hurriedly returning to the cockpit of the defendant he,\u00a0 in\u00a0 company with the wounded man, pursued the said Tapic\u00a0 to the defendant's cockpit; that on arriving there they were ordered to halt by the defendant and asked where they were going.\u00a0\u00a0 They replied\u00a0 that they were pursuing\u00a0 Tapic,\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant then said:\u00a0 \"Do you know this?\" (waving a\u00a0 revolver) and ordered them to lay\u00a0 down their arms; that\u00a0 they complied with this order on account of the fear of being shot.<br\/><br\/>The wounded\u00a0 man, Laoronilla, after\u00a0 relating what occurred in the cockpit of Gavato, which corroborates\u00a0 in every detail the testimony of Tapic, then stated what had occurred, in exactly the same manner as a former witness, when\u00a0 they arrived at\u00a0 the defendant's cockpit in pursuit of Tapic.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the denial on the part of\u00a0 the defendant and his attempt by means of witnesses to prove that he had nothing whatever to do with Tapic's committing this crime, we think that his guilt has been established beyond peradventure of a doubt.<br\/><br\/>The defendant and Gavato were operating cockpits near each other.\u00a0 There was considerable\u00a0 competition between the owners of these two cockpits.\u00a0 Gavato's business was more prosperous than the defendant's.\u00a0 Tapic was in the defendant's cockpit on May 30, 1909, and went direct from there to and entered the cockpit of Gavato, armed with a bolo, and wounded Laoronilla.\u00a0\u00a0 Tapic had no enmity against this wounded man, neither did he have any intention of injuring any particular person, but his\u00a0 object was to disturb the people assembled there and\u00a0 injure\u00a0 Gavato's business. After doing this he returned immediately to the defendant's cockpit and sought his protection,\u00a0 and the defendant did, in fact, protect him by means of a revolver.<br\/><br\/>Article 13 of the Penal Code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"The following\u00a0 are considered as principals:<br\/><center><br\/>* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/center> <br\/>\"2.

They appealed.\u00a0 During the pendency of the case on appeal the defendant Lucio Hermenegildo withdrew his appeal.<br\/><br\/>It appears that\u00a0 on the 3d day of May, 1908, Ling Aling, Awi\u00a0 Cuan, and Co-boy Cuan were conducting\u00a0 a store in Bais, Oriental Negros.\u00a0 The building used as a store was occupied by them\u00a0 also as living quarters. About 7 o'clock of the morning of that day the defendant Santiago Villanueva went to the store and sought to buy a pair of shoes on credit.\u00a0 He\u00a0 was refused.\u00a0 Nevertheless\u00a0 he wrote a promissory note and leaving it on a table in the store\u00a0 went out.\u00a0\u00a0 At about 10\u00a0 of the same morning he returned to the store and asked credit for a shirt and a\u00a0 pair of pantaloons. On being\u00a0 again refused\u00a0 credit he asked for\u00a0 a piece of paper, saying that\u00a0 he would send to\u00a0 his house for the money.\u00a0 He then left.\u00a0 At about 1 of the same day he went again\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 store,\u00a0 this time, however,\u00a0 accompanied by the other two defendants.\u00a0 Having entered\u00a0 he paid the proprietors\u00a0 for the\u00a0 shirt\u00a0 and pantaloons, whereupon the defendant Gamilla\u00a0 seized Aling by the hand and struck at him with\u00a0 his fist, failing, however,\u00a0 to reach him.\u00a0 At this the defendant Hermenegildo struck Co-boy with a stick and the defendant Villanueva, seizing a piece of iron, struck Awi Cuan in the temple with such force that he fell to the floor.\u00a0 The defendants then went out, and after their departure, the Chinamen\u00a0 closed\u00a0 the\u00a0 store and locked the doors.\u00a0 Soon the defendants\u00a0 returned.\u00a0 They forced the door\u00a0 open, breaking\u00a0 the lock\u00a0 and fastenings, and again entered the store.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendant Gamilla assaulted Aling with a stick, wounding him in the face, breaking his nose and causing injuries which required more than thirty days for their cure.<br\/><br\/>These facts are fully established and proved by the testimony\u00a0 of the Chinamen assaulted and by that of Vivencio Baldado,\u00a0 Eusebio\u00a0 Buso, Jose\u00a0 Maria\u00a0 Montenegro,\u00a0 Bais Emilio Tevez, and Eladio de Guia.<br\/><br\/>Testimony tending to\u00a0 contradict that of the prosecution as to the forcible entry was given by the defendants.\u00a0 The court below,\u00a0 however, found in favor of the\u00a0 Government. A careful examination of the evidence leads us to the conclusion\u00a0 that\u00a0 his finding was correct.\u00a0 Moreover,\u00a0 in\u00a0 any view that may be taken\u00a0 of it, we meet the decision of this court in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Arceo (3 Phil.

'<br\/><br\/>By\u00a0 another written\u00a0 answer to the amended complaint the said\u00a0 defendants denied paragraphs 1,\u00a0 2, 4, 5, and 6, and admitted paragraph 3 of the complaint, alleging that they were\u00a0 and still are in\u00a0 possession as owners of part of the land mentioned in the said paragraph 3; that said land is bounded on the north by lands of\u00a0 Inocenta Perez, on the south by that of Juan Palermo, on\u00a0 the east by that of Pelagio Villegas, and on the west by land belonging to a non-Christian; that said portion of land was included in a false possessory information in the name of Liberato Perez in 1895,\u00a0 and was fraudulently recorded in the registry of property;\u00a0 that in 1895 Liberato Perez\u00a0 was not, nor had ever been in possession of\u00a0 said land, and that\u00a0 the person who was in possession\u00a0 in said year was Vicente Perez, the real owner; that Perez transferred his rights to Pedro Olang, and upon\u00a0 the death of the\u00a0 latter, his widow, Dominga Ubaldo,\u00a0 inherited the said parcel; for these reasons they asked that the entry made in the registry of property be canceled and that the possessory information be declared null and void in so far as the land of the\u00a0 defendants is referred to, and that the latter be absolved of the complaint with the costs against the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>The case came up for trial and evidence was adduced by the parties, their exhibits being made of record.\u00a0 On the 6th of March, 1906, judgment was rendered by the lower court ordering that Inocenta Perez be restored in the possession of the usurped land which the defendants who retain it must vacate, the same being the property of Lucia Perez and Eduvigis Perez,\u00a0 and that Inocenta be indemnified by the defendants in the sum of P250 for losses and damages, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 21st of September,\u00a0 1903, and that the\u00a0 said plaintiffs shall recover costs from the defendants.<br\/><br\/>The latter excepted to the foregoing decision and moved for a new trial on the ground that it was contrary to law, and that the findings were manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence; the motion was overruled,\u00a0 to\u00a0 which the petitioners excepted and presented the corresponding bill of exceptions which was approved and submitted to this court.<br\/><br\/>It has been fully proven in the case that Liberato Perez, the father of two of the plaintiffs, by virtue of the possession he enjoyed as owner for more than sixty years, without counting that of his ancestors, lawfully acquired by means of extraordinary prescription, under the provisions of article 1959 of the Civil Code, the ownership of about 30 hectares of land described in the complaint.\u00a0 There can be no question therefore as to the right of his two daughters, plaintiffs herein, to recover possession of the duly identified portion of said land\u00a0 from the defendants who, forcibly and without any reason whatever, took possession of said land; the said daughters succeeded their father in\u00a0 his\u00a0 rights and obligations from the moment of his death\u00a0 (art. 661, Civil Code), and as actual proprietors of a portion of the estate retained at the time\u00a0 the complaint\u00a0 was\u00a0 filed, they were entitled to bring an action against the\u00a0 holders and possessors thereof to recover possession (art.\u00a0 348, Civil Code), it appearing in the case that said portion was forcibly taken possession of, and retained up to the present\u00a0 day; by the express will\u00a0 of the owners of the said portion, Inocenta Perez, another of the plaintiffs, enjoyed the possession and usufruct of the same.<br\/><br\/>Impugning the right of\u00a0 the\u00a0 plaintiffs, the\u00a0 defendants alleged that they were and still are the owners of the\u00a0 part or portion of land claimed, for the reason that Pedro Olang had acquired it in 1895 from its lawful owner and possessor, Vicente Perez, and that Dominga Ubaldo inherited it upon the death of\u00a0 her husband, the said Olang; for said reason they asked that the possessory information filed by Liberato Perez while living for the ownership of the whole parcel of land\u00a0 be\u00a0 declared\u00a0 null, as\u00a0 well as its\u00a0 registration in the registry\u00a0 of property, because the portion\u00a0 of\u00a0 land\u00a0 in\u00a0 controversy was fraudulently included in said information and recorded in the registry in the said year.<br\/><br\/>It is nowhere shown that Vicente Perez was either the owner or in possession as such, in 1895, of the portion of land\u00a0 in controversy, nor that Pedro Olang had lawfully acquired or had been in possession thereof; hence, the defendant Dominga Ubaldo could not have succeeded to any right to\u00a0 that part of the land, notwithstanding the documentary\u00a0 evidence and the testimony of\u00a0 the witnesses with which she attempted to show such right.<br\/><br\/>It appears to be proven in the case that in January, 1903, Dominga Ubaldo and Domingo Cortes, her second husband, took\u00a0 possession\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 portion\u00a0 of land and\u00a0 ejected therefrom the laborers that Inocenta\u00a0 Perez employed to work thereon, and from the day of the usurpation to the present day they have retained the estate, and in spite of this act of spoliation, an actual transgression which is not permitted even to the lawful owner, and\u00a0 without\u00a0 having presented any deed of transfer by which Olang might have acquired the ownership of said portion of the land,\u00a0 his widow now claims to be the owner of the same.\u00a0 Dominga Bolado, mother of the plaintiff Inocenta Perez\u00a0 and\u00a0 of\u00a0 Vicente Perez, only received one-half\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 30 hectares of land to which the possessory information refers, and took possession\u00a0 thereof in January,\u00a0 1902; before the expiration of said year, the actual date not appearing, the said Vicente Perez died; his mother was still living, and the latter\u00a0 before her death transferred the possession of the said moiety of the land to her only\u00a0 surviving daughter, Inocenta.\u00a0 From all\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 foregoing it is logically\u00a0 deduced that Vicente Perez was\u00a0 never\u00a0 in possession\u00a0 of the estate in 1902 under title of ownership, from which\u00a0 date his mother took charge of the\u00a0 same in usufruct, for the reason that he\u00a0 died a few months later, and much less in 1895, because Liberate Perez, who possessed it\u00a0 in its entirety as the real owner,\u00a0 was still living.<br\/><br\/>It may be true that Vicente Perez\u00a0 owed Pedro\u00a0 Olang 100 pesos in the year 1895, but it can not be admitted that4 he gave the said land as security;\u00a0 it\u00a0 did not belong to him, nor could he in any manner dispose of it without the knowledge or\u00a0 consent\u00a0 of its\u00a0 lawful\u00a0 owner, and,\u00a0 seeing that he died before his mother,\u00a0 he could not\u00a0 have succeeded\u00a0 her in the enjoyment of the\u00a0 said\u00a0 portion of\u00a0 land.<br\/><br\/>Apart from the foregoing,\u00a0 Pedro Olang and\u00a0 Doroteo Malahay, when\u00a0 they were informed of the petition presented by Liberato Perez\u00a0 asking for the possessory\u00a0 information\u00a0 already referred to, stated that they, as adjoining owners, agreed to the facts stated in the said petition, and that they had no\u00a0 objection or claim to make in the matter. After the above statement made by\u00a0 Olang in\u00a0 April, 1895, it is not likely that he acquired from\u00a0 Vicente Perez\u00a0 the land covered by\u00a0 said\u00a0 information; this document was\u00a0 attested by Malahay as municipal captain,\u00a0 they knowing that it did not belong to the latter\u00a0 but to\u00a0 Liberato,\u00a0 and in consequence Pedro Olang could not have transmitted any right to\u00a0 his widow since he had not received any from Vicente Perez, his\u00a0 supposed predecessor\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 possession of the estate.<br\/><br\/>The record does not show that Vicente Perez was ever in possession\u00a0 of any portion of the\u00a0 land covered by the possessory information, and consequently he could not transmit any\u00a0 right to Pedro Olang, nor the right of possession to said\u00a0 portion of the land.<br\/><br\/>The widow of the creditor Pedro Olang claims\u00a0 to rest the right of the latter, and therefore her own\u00a0 right, on the document marked \"Exhibit A,\"\u00a0 dated January\u00a0 15, 1895, wherein\u00a0 it appears that\u00a0 Vicente Perez declared to\u00a0 have mortgaged to Pedro Olang for the sum of 100 pesos a parcel of land owned by him situated in the barrio of Looc, with a description of\u00a0 its boundaries,\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 condition that he would continue to work it and obtain the benefits therefrom, but if it were not redeemed within a period of three years, that is to say on the 14th\u00a0 of January, 1898, the land would then become the\u00a0 property of the creditor.\u00a0 The\u00a0 document is a\u00a0 private one,\u00a0 and could not therefore be entered in the register,\u00a0 and although it\u00a0 has been attached\u00a0 to the record of the case it does not appear that the signature\u00a0 of Vicente Perez at the foot of the same was\u00a0 offered in evidence or was duly identified.<br\/><br\/>The contract entered into by means of the said document is one of loan with mortgage; not one of sale under <i>pacto de retro,<\/i> because beyond the word\u00a0 rescate\u00a0 (redemption) said\u00a0 document does not\u00a0 contain any word to\u00a0 show that the agreement was a sale <i>a retro.<\/i><br\/><br\/>However, even if there were a doubt as to whether the contract entered into by Vicente Perez was one of mortgage or one of sale, on the hypothesis that he could dispose of the property, while it is riot possible\u00a0 to decide the question by the language of the document, in justice it must be assumed that\u00a0 the debtor assumed\u00a0 a lesser obligation and that in accord with\u00a0 the\u00a0 creditor he bound\u00a0 himself to\u00a0 execute\u00a0 a mortgage which involves a greater reciprocity of interests than a contract of sale under <i>pacto de retro, <\/i>in spite of the fact\u00a0 that both the latter\u00a0 and that of mortgage\u00a0 involve\u00a0 a valuable consideration in accordance with the provisions of article 1289 of the Civil Code,<br\/><br\/>On this supposition, in the absence of payment,\u00a0 on the obligation becoming due the creditor would be entitled to have the\u00a0 mortgaged property sold to satisfy the debt, but not to appropriate or dispose of it.\u00a0 (Arts. 1857, 1858, and 1859, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>The land in question is comprised within a\u00a0 larger tract of 30 hectares, referred\u00a0 to in the possessory\u00a0 information instituted at the request\u00a0 of Liberato Perez in the court of the justice of the peace of Guiljungan and finally approved on the 7th of April, 1895, a date posterior to that of the above-mentioned document of mortgage in favor of Pedro Olang;\u00a0 this information\u00a0 was recorded in the registry of property on the 16th of the said month of April; and if the contract of mortgage\u00a0 of\u00a0 the 13th of January were a\u00a0 true contract,\u00a0 it can not be understood how Pedro Olang and Doroteo Malahay\u00a0 made statements in\u00a0 the month of April following in conformity\u00a0 with the facts contained\u00a0 in\u00a0 said possessory information,\u00a0 nor\u00a0 can the declaration given by Higino\u00a0 de la\u00a0 Serna in said\u00a0 information agree with\u00a0 that made in this suit, as they are markedly opposed and\u00a0 contradictory.\u00a0 From all\u00a0 of\u00a0 the foregoing it is deduced\u00a0 that the said document was prepared in order to somehow legalize the right which the widow of Pedro Olang believes she has to the land in question.<br\/><br\/>As was agreed\u00a0 to in the aforesaid document, although the same be contrary to law, in\u00a0 the absence of\u00a0 payment of the 100 pesos\u00a0 the mortgaged land could not become the property of the creditor until the 14th of January, 1898, that is, after the lapse\u00a0 of three years, and in the meantime the debtor, Vicente Perez, was to continue in the possession and enjoyment of the fruits of the land; yet the defendants sought to prove that Pedro Olang or his\u00a0 widow had been in possession of the property, as owner of the same, for the last nine or ten years, the result being that their witnesses testified to facts which were not true, undoubtedly for the purpose of legalizing the forcible usurpation\u00a0 of the land in 1903.<br\/><br\/>The certified copy of the said information duly recorded in the registry of property is a public document, one which is protected by articles 390, 391, 393, and 394 of the Mortgage Law, and by sections 299 and 331 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and unless\u00a0 it be proved\u00a0 to be null or invalid, which has not been\u00a0 done\u00a0 by the defendants, it must\u00a0 be sustained by the courts.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the legal capacity\u00a0 of the plaintiffs\u00a0 to bring this suit and appear therein, their respective rights are based on the provisions of section 115\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Code of Civil Procedure, because it involves their own property, and their\u00a0 respective husbands\u00a0 have no personal rights or interest therein.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above\u00a0 set forth by which the errors assigned to the court below have been\u00a0 refuted, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be and is hereby\u00a0 affirmed, and the defendants are ordered to vacate the land in question and deliver it to the plaintiffs, and to pay to\u00a0 Inocenta\u00a0 Perez the sum\u00a0 of\u00a0 P250 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 reasons stated in said judgment, with legal interest\u00a0 thereon, and to pay the costs of this instance.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Johnson, Carson,<\/i> and <i>Moreland, JJ.,<\/i>\u00a0 concur.<br\/><\/div>",

That plaintiff\u00a0 is a citizen of the United States of America, of age, and a resident of the city of Manila, Philippine Islands;\u00a0 that\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 is,\u00a0 and at all times herein referred to has\u00a0 been, an officer\u00a0 of the Government of the Philippine\u00a0 Islands, to wit, the acting register\u00a0 of deeds of the subprovince of Benguet, and is a resident of the municipality of Baguio in said subprovince.<br\/><br\/>\"II.

Because it appears from the complaint that the plaintiff has not done all that is required by the provisions of the Land Registration Act to entitle him to demand\u00a0 the, registration of the patent and\u00a0 the entry\u00a0 of a certificate of title and the\u00a0 issuance of an owner's duplicate certificate under section 122 of said Act.<br\/><br\/>\"2. Because it appears from the complaint that the plaintiff has refused to pay the one-tenth of one per centum of the fair value of\u00a0 the\u00a0 land or any\u00a0 sum whatever for the assurance fund, which\u00a0 by section 99 of said Land Registration Act,\u00a0 as\u00a0 amended, is expressly made .payable to the register of\u00a0 deeds upon\u00a0 the original registration\u00a0 of\u00a0 any land under said Act.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 Because it does not appear from\u00a0 the complaint that the defendant has unlawfully neglected or refused to perform\u00a0 any act which the law\u00a0 specially\u00a0 enjoins\u00a0 as a duty resulting from his office as register of deeds, or that he has unlawfully excluded the plaintiff from the use and enjoyment of any right to which he is entitled, and it does not appear that the duty is specially enjoined upon the register of deeds to register a patent\u00a0 to public land and enter a certificate of\u00a0 title thereto and\u00a0 issue an owner's duplicate certificate without the payment to him of the one-tenth of one per centum of the assessed or fair value of the real estate at the time of such original registration.\"<\/blockquote>The petitioner claims that he has complied with all the requirements of law precedent to the issuance of a patent in his favor and that a patent for a mineral claim has been issued by the\u00a0 Government of the Philippine Islands to the plaintiff and has been filed by the official who issued said patent with the defendant as register of deeds of the subprovince of Benguet.\u00a0 This\u00a0 patent was filed with the register of deeds of the subprovince of Benguet for registration in accordance with the provisions of section 122 of Act No. 496.\u00a0 It is alleged by the petitioner that the register of deeds\u00a0 refused to register such\u00a0 patent unless and until\u00a0 he should pay the fee provided for in section 99 of Act No. 496. The question\u00a0 presented\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 court by the demurrer is whether or not it\u00a0 is the plain and specific\u00a0 duty of the register of deeds\u00a0 to\u00a0 register\u00a0 said\u00a0 patent without demanding the fee provided for in section 99 of said Act No. 496. Section 37 of the Act of Congress of July 1,1902, provides how persons, associations, or corporations\u00a0 may secure patents to mineral claims.<br\/><br\/>Section 122\u00a0 of Act No. 496 (which Act\u00a0 is known as the Act providing for\u00a0 the registration of lands under the Torrens system) provides that \"Wherever public lands in the Philippine Islands belonging to\u00a0 the\u00a0 Government\u00a0 of the United States or to the Government of the Philippine Islands <i><\/i><i>are alienated,\u00a0 granted, or conveyed to persons or to public or private corporations, the same shall be brought forthwith under the operation of this Act and shall become registered lands.\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>Section 73 of Act No. 926 provides that patents to public lands shall be issued \"in the name of the United States and the\u00a0 Philippine\u00a0 Government under\u00a0 the signature\u00a0 of the Civil Governor; but such\u00a0 patents\u00a0 (patents to public lands) <i> or certificates shall be effective only for the purposes defined in section 122 of the Land Registration Act (No. 496), and the actual conveyance of\u00a0 the land shall be effected only\u00a0 as provided in said section.\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>That part of section 122\u00a0 (Act No. 496)\u00a0 to which said section 73 (Act No. 926) refers is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The deed, grant, or instrument of conveyance from the Government to the grantee shall not take effect as a conveyance or\u00a0 bind the land, but shall\u00a0 operate only as a contract between the\u00a0 Government and the grantee and as evidence of authority to the clerk or register of deeds to make registration.\u00a0 The act of registration shall be the operative act to convey and affect the lands, and in all cases under this Act (No. 496) registration shall be made in the office of the register of deeds for the province where the land lies.\u00a0 The fees\u00a0 for registration shall be paid by the grantee.\u00a0 After due registration and issue of the certificate and '<i>Owner's duplicate,'<\/i> such land shall be registered land for all purposes under this Act.\"<\/blockquote>The petitioner contends that the only fee for registration which he\u00a0 is required to pay is the fee of $3 (P6) provided for in section 114 of Act No. 496.<br\/><br\/>The respondent contends that all patents and certificates granting\u00a0 <i>\"public lands<\/i>\" issued by the Government of the United States or the Government of the Philippine Islands, in order to be registered in accordance with the provisions of section 122 (Act No. 496), the holder thereof must pay the fee provided for in section 99 of said Act.<br\/><br\/>Act No. 496 of the Philippine Commission provides for a system of registration of land titles\u00a0 under a system popularly known as the \"Torrens system.\"\u00a0 Said Act provides for the registration of titles to <i>lands held by individuals, or, in other words, the registration of titles to lands which have already been granted by the State to private persons.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 Section 19 provides who may make application for registration of title.\u00a0\u00a0 Section 21, as amended by Act No. 809, provides the form of application.\u00a0 Sections 29 and 41 provide for the registration or recording of the decree of the court granting the registration of\u00a0 the title under\u00a0 said\u00a0 Act.\u00a0 Section 99 provides that in the original registration or\u00a0 recording (meaning simply the first registration under the \"Torrens system\")\u00a0 that there shall\u00a0 be paid to the register of deeds one-tenth of 1 per cent of the assessed value of the\u00a0 real estate, on the basis of\u00a0 the last assessment\u00a0 for\u00a0 municipal taxation,\u00a0 as an assurance\u00a0 fund.\u00a0\u00a0 Act No. 700 of the Philippine Commission provides for the method of ascertaining the value\u00a0 of the land, in case the same has not been theretofore assessed\u00a0 for taxation.<br\/><br\/>Act No. 926 of the Philippine\u00a0 Commission provides for the issuing of patents to public\u00a0 lands in six different cases, as follows:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 Sections 1 to 9, for patents to\u00a0 homesteads on the <i>public domain<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Second. Sections 10 to 21, for sales\u00a0 of portions of the <i>public domain<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 Sections 22 to 31, for leases\u00a0 of portions of the <i>public domain<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Fourth. Sections 32 to 35, for free\u00a0 patents to individual settlers on portions of the <i>public domain. <\/i><br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0\u00a0 Sections\u00a0 36 to 53, for the\u00a0 reservation of town sites.<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 Sections\u00a0 54\u00a0 to 67, for\u00a0 unperfected titles\u00a0 and Spanish grants and concessions of the <i>public domain<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>In each of the above grants or patents issued in accordance\u00a0 with the provisions\u00a0 applicable thereto no\u00a0 provision whatever\u00a0 is made for the payment of a fee for the registration of the patent,\u00a0 except under the patent granted for <i>unperfected titles\u00a0 and Spanish\u00a0 grants and concessions of the public domain,<\/i> where, in section 57 (Act No. 926), we find this provision:<br\/><blockquote>\"The fees provided to be paid for the registration of lands under the Land Registration Act (No. 496)\u00a0 shall be collected from applicants under this chapter, <i>except<\/i> that upon the <i>original registration <\/i> of\u00a0 the land claimed hereunder no fee shall be required for the assurance fund.\"<\/blockquote>We believe that this exception is significant of the fact that it was the intention\u00a0 of\u00a0 the lawmaking body to require the payment of the fees\u00a0 for the registration of patents to public lands issued under the provisions of said\u00a0 Act No. 926.\u00a0 This view is emphasized by the fact that section 122 (Act No. 496) expressly\u00a0 provides that <i>all patents to public lands<\/i>\u00a0 shall be brought forthwith under the provisions of the Act providing for the registration\u00a0 of the land under the \"Torrens system.\"\u00a0 Had\u00a0 it been the intention of the law- making body - as\u00a0 the petitioner claims - not to require the payment of one-tenth of 1 per cent by the holder of a patent to <i>public land <\/i>for the registration of the same, then why did the Commission expressly relieve the holder of a patent to a portion of the public\u00a0 domain (of unperfected titles and Spanish grants and concessions) from the payment of this fee, when at the same time they had brought <i>all\u00a0 patents to public lands under the provisions of Act No. 496?<\/i><br\/><br\/>It will be noted by comparing section 41 of Act\u00a0 No. 496 with section 122 of the same Act, the former relating to the registration of titles to <i>private lands<\/i> and the latter to the registration of <i>public lands, that\u00a0 the\u00a0 procedure, after the decree,<\/i> in the first instance, is granted by the court, and the patent, in the\u00a0 second,\u00a0 by the Governor (see section 73, Act No. 926) is substantially the same.\u00a0\u00a0 It is as\u00a0 follows. Section 41 provides \"Immediately upon the entry\u00a0 of the decree of registration the clerk shall send a certified copy thereof, under the seal of\u00a0 the court, to\u00a0 the register of deeds for the province, or provinces, or city in which the land lies, and the register of deeds shall transcribe the decree in a book to be called\u00a0 the 'Registration Book,'\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\u00a0 The entry made by the\u00a0 register of deeds in this book in each case shall be the original certificate of title, and shall be signed by him and sealed with the seal of the court.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 The register of deeds shall in each case make an<i> exact duplicate of the original certificate,<\/i> including the seal, but putting on it the words '<i>Owner's duplicate certificate,'<\/i> and\u00a0 deliver the same to the owner or to his attorney duly authorized.\"<br\/><br\/>Section 122 in part provides \"It shall be the duty of the official (the\u00a0 Governor-General)\u00a0 issuing the instrument of alienation, grant,\u00a0 or conveyance in behalf of the Government to\u00a0 cause such instrument,\u00a0 before\u00a0 its delivery to the grantee,\u00a0 to be filed with the register of deeds for the province where the land lies and to be <i>there registered like other deeds and conveyances,<\/i> whereupon\u00a0 a certificate\u00a0 shall be entered as in other cases of registered land, and an <i>'Owner's duplicate certificate'<\/i> issued to the grantee.\"<br\/><br\/>It will be\u00a0 noted also that section 122 provides that this patent, \"before\u00a0 its delivery to the grantee,\" shall be\u00a0 filed with the register\u00a0 of deeds\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 \"to be\u00a0 there\u00a0 registered <i>like other deeds and conveyances.\" <\/i><br\/><br\/>What does the phrase \"like other deeds and conveyances,\" when applied to these patents and the\u00a0 registration of the same, mean? It\u00a0 can only mean titles issued under\u00a0 said Act No.\u00a0 496.\u00a0 It\u00a0 can not be construed to apply\u00a0 to titles given or executed between\u00a0 private parties, for\u00a0 the reason that registration\u00a0 under the \"Torrens system\" makes no effort to change the method of transferring or registering titles granted by or to private persons, nor for the issuance of an <i>\"Owner's duplicate certificate.\" <\/i><br\/><br\/>It will be noted further that after the patent is filed with the register\u00a0 of\u00a0 deeds for the proper\u00a0 province, that a\u00a0 certificate shall be entered as in other cases of registered land, and an \"<i>Owner's duplicate certificate\"<\/i> issued to the grantee. This provision of said section 122 shows clearly\u00a0 that the phrase in said\u00a0 section \"to be there\u00a0 registered like other deeds and conveyances\" must necessarily refer to \"other deeds and conveyances issued in accordance with\u00a0 the\u00a0 provisions of law granting 'Torrens titles.'\"<br\/><br\/>All these Acts must be construed together.\u00a0\u00a0 If we were to construe section 41 alone (Act No. 496)\u00a0 we might conclude that the register of property would be compelled to register a private title or a title to private lands granted under said Act without the collection of any\u00a0 fee or fees whatever.\u00a0 This section, read alone, seems to be mandatory in its terms.\u00a0 It says nothing about the collection of fees; yet no\u00a0 one contends\u00a0 that the fees provided for in section 99 of said Act must not be paid before the owner\u00a0 of the \"original title\" is entitled to the certificate.<br\/><br\/>Section\u00a0 122 provides that the\u00a0 register of deeds must collect\u00a0 the\u00a0 fees.\u00a0 To\u00a0 what does\u00a0 the\u00a0 word\u00a0 \"fees\" apply? Section 57 of Act No. 926 says that the fees provided for the registration\u00a0 of\u00a0 lands, under the Land Registration Act, shall be collected from the applicants, <i> except that no fee shall be required for an assurance fund. <\/i><br\/><br\/>Section 114 of Act No. 496 as amended by\u00a0 section 7 of Act\u00a0 No. 1648, as well as by section 11 of\u00a0 Act No. 1699, provides what fees shall be collected\u00a0 in the course\u00a0 of the proceedings for the registration of titles under the \"Torrens system\" and the amount in each case.\u00a0\u00a0 This section\u00a0 (114) with its amendments read alone might be construed to include or cover all fees.\u00a0\u00a0 It will be noted, however, that <i>all these fees<\/i> are for services actually rendered by the officers of the Court of Land Registration or by the register of deeds of the province, etc.,\u00a0 while the fee under section 99\u00a0 is not for services at all, but for the purpose of creating an \"assurance fund.\"<br\/><br\/>The applicant admitted, by paying the fee for recording or registering his patent, that section 114 of Act No. 496, as amended, was applicable to\u00a0 a\u00a0 patent for public\u00a0 lands. An examination of section 114, as amended, shows that the only fee or fees collectible are fees\u00a0 for services\u00a0 actually rendered by employees of the Government.<br\/><br\/>Section 6 of Act\u00a0 No. 1699 provides\u00a0 that all fees for the services of the clerk of the Court of Land Registration shall be deposited in the Insular\u00a0 Treasury,\u00a0 and all fees\u00a0 payable for the\u00a0 services of\u00a0 the register\u00a0 of\u00a0 deeds, etc.,\u00a0 shall be deposited in the provincial treasury, or in the case of the register of the city of Manila, then\u00a0 they shall be deposited in the Insular Treasury.<br\/><br\/>These funds are not available\u00a0 for the payment of any damages which may\u00a0 result to\u00a0 the real owner of\u00a0 property by reason\u00a0 of an illegal or\u00a0 improper registration under the \"Torrens system\"\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 name\u00a0 of\u00a0 another, not\u00a0 the real owner.\u00a0\u00a0 (See sees.\u00a0 100, 101,102,\u00a0 and 103, Act No.\u00a0 496.)<br\/><br\/>The \"assurance fund\" is created for the purpose of paying any damages which may result from an improper or illegal registration.\u00a0 All the people of the Philippine Archipelago may be taxed for the purpose of paying\u00a0 these damages if the \"assurance fund\" is\u00a0 not sufficient,\u00a0\u00a0 (Sec. 103, Act No.\u00a0 496.)\u00a0\u00a0 A large portion\u00a0 of the lands of the Archipelago still belong to\u00a0 the public domain.\u00a0 All original patents granted thereto are given the advantage\u00a0 and protection of the provisions of Act No. 496. Why should the future holders of these original patents be entitled to the protection\u00a0 of\u00a0 this law without sharing its burdens?\u00a0 We believe\u00a0 that when the legislative department of the Government provided that \"Whenever public lands in the Philippine Islands,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 are\u00a0 alienated, granted, or\u00a0 conveyed to persons or to public or to private corporations, the same shall be brought forthwith under\u00a0 the operation of this\u00a0 Act\u00a0 (No. 496) and\u00a0 shall become registered lands,\" thereby giving the holder of\u00a0 these\u00a0 original patents the benefit of said Act (No. 496), it intended also to impose upon such grantees the burdens of said Act.\u00a0 But in\u00a0 reply to this consideration we are met with the question,\u00a0 Why should the\u00a0 Government require a\u00a0 fund to insure against its own\u00a0 acts, thereby implying that\u00a0 there\u00a0 is no possibility of mistakes occurring in the\u00a0 granting of these patents and that\u00a0 there\u00a0 is no possibility of the occurrence of damages? The, literally,\u00a0 hundreds of\u00a0 cases which have\u00a0 been\u00a0 brought in the courts of the United States to set aside original patents granted by the Government\u00a0 which have been secured by fraud, mistake, etc., are a complete answer to this\u00a0 contention.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion and so hold that when the legislative department of the Government provided\u00a0 in\u00a0 section 99 of Act No. 496 that \"Upon the original registration of land\u00a0 under this Act,\" etc.,\u00a0 \"there\u00a0 shall be\u00a0 paid\u00a0 to the register of deeds one-tenth of one per cent of the assessed value of the real estate,\" etc.; and when it provided that \"Whenever\u00a0 public lands,\" etc., \"are\u00a0 alienated, granted, or conveyed,\" etc.,\u00a0 \"the same shall be brought forthwith under the provisions of this Act\" (sec. 122, Act No. 496), that it intended to bring all future titles\u00a0 granted\u00a0 to public lands immediately under the\u00a0 \"Torrens system\"\u00a0 and\u00a0 that such holders, in\u00a0 order to secure the registration of such titles, should make a contribution to the \"assurance fund.\"<br\/><br\/>It not being the clear and\u00a0 specific legal duty,\u00a0 therefore, of the defendant to register the patent in question without requiring the payment of the fee\u00a0 provided for\u00a0 in\u00a0 section 99 of Act No. 496, the demurrer is hereby sustained with costs, and the\u00a0 petitioner\u00a0 is hereby\u00a0 given\u00a0 ten days from receipt\u00a0 of notice of this decision in which to amend his petition, if\u00a0 he so desires.\u00a0\u00a0 If the petition\u00a0 is not amended within ten days, then let a judgment be entered with costs denying the issuance of the writ\u00a0 of mandamus prayed for\u00a0 in said petition.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.

Defendant now requires of plaintiff a further payment of one-tenth of 1 per cent of the value of the patented land for\u00a0 an assurance fund, and requires plaintiff to file the affidavits of three disinterested persons for the purpose of showing that the value fixed by plaintiff is just.\u00a0 Defendant doubtless relies for such\u00a0 requirement upon section 99 of Act No. 496, which, as amended by Act No. 700, reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Upon the original registration\u00a0 of land under this Act, and also upon the entry of a certificate showing title as registered owners in heirs or devisees, there shall be paid to the register of deeds one-tenth of one per centum of the assessed value of the real estate on\u00a0 the basis of the last assessment for municipal taxation, as an assurance fund.<br\/><br\/>\"In case land is subdivided subsequent to the last assessment and registration proceedings are had as\u00a0 to a portion only of such land, the value of such portion, for\u00a0 the purposes of this section\u00a0 and for the payment required by paragraph four of section one hundred and fourteen, shall be fixed by agreement between the applicant and the tax collector of the city or province where the land\u00a0 is situated and shall be proportioned to the value such\u00a0 land bears to the whole tract assessed.\u00a0 In case of disagreement between the tax collector and the applicant as to the\u00a0 value of the land, the question shall be submitted to the court for decision.<br\/><br\/>\"Where land sought to be registered has not been assessed for taxation, its value, for the purposes of this Act shall be its market value, and the applicant shall file with his application\u00a0 the\u00a0 sworn declaration\u00a0 of three\u00a0 disinterested persons that the value fixed by him is to their knowledge a fair valuation.<br\/><br\/>\"The court is authorized\u00a0 to increase\u00a0 the\u00a0 valuation\u00a0 as fixed\u00a0 under the two preceding paragraphs should it appear upon\u00a0 the hearing that the value stated in the application is too small.\"<\/blockquote>The issue is therefore this: Defendant contends that his registration of the patent, entering of the\u00a0 certificate, and issue\u00a0 of\u00a0 the duplicate, under section\u00a0 122, constitutes \"the original registration of land under this Act,\" as the phrase is used in section\u00a0 99;\u00a0 while plaintiff maintains that \"the original registration of land under this Act\" does not embrace the proceedings of a register of deeds under section 122.<br\/><br\/>It is apparent that sections 99 to 107 of the Land Registration Act provide in effect an insurance of titles, and that the payment of one-tenth of 1 per cent upon original registration is practically a premium for such insurance.<br\/><br\/>Act No. 496 provides\u00a0 two ways in\u00a0 which land may be brought under the Torrens system.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 first way is\u00a0 by judicial proceedings in the Court of Land Registration, terminating in the decree of that court.\u00a0\u00a0 The second way is by proceedings purely administrative taken upon the alienation of public lands.\u00a0 The first method is provided for in sections 19 to 49; the second by section 122.\u00a0 I submit that only the first method, that is, registration upon a judicial decree, is meant by the phrase \"original registration,\" as employed in section 99.<br\/><br\/>If it\u00a0 should\u00a0 appear that the phrase \"original\u00a0 registration\" is used with a particular meaning in previous sections of Act\u00a0 No. 496, then it may fairly be assumed that it is used with\u00a0 the\u00a0 same meaning in\u00a0 section 99.\u00a0 Sections\u00a0 19 to 49 of the Act, covering judicial proceedings in the Court of Land\u00a0 Registration,\u00a0 are\u00a0 grouped\u00a0 under the\u00a0 general heading \"ORIGINAL REGISTRATION.\"\u00a0 Again examining section 99, as amended\u00a0 by Act No. 700, we find\u00a0 that the three paragraphs\u00a0 added\u00a0 by Act No. 700\u00a0 indicate clearly that \"original registration,\" as used in that section, refers only to\u00a0 registration upon judicial decree, and that the insurance premium is to be paid only for a judicial proceeding.\u00a0\u00a0 Where, for\u00a0 instance, registered land has not\u00a0 been assessed for taxation,\u00a0 its market\u00a0 value must be stated by the <i>applicant<\/i> in his <i>application,<\/i>\u00a0 and this\u00a0 must be accompanied by three disinterested affidavits confirming the value fixed by the <i>applicant.<\/i>\u00a0 And so, where land has been subdivided since the last assessment,\u00a0 the tax collector and the <i>applicant<\/i> shall agree upon the assessment value of the parcel sought\u00a0 to\u00a0 be registered.\u00a0 Upon reference to the sections under the\u00a0 head of original registration, we find that \"applicant\" is the term used for the petitioner in the Court of Land Registration,\u00a0 and\u00a0 \"application\"\u00a0 is the technical name for his petition.\u00a0\u00a0 The form of application contained in section\u00a0 21, in its second\u00a0 clause, provides for fixing\u00a0 the value.\u00a0 All this is entirely inapplicable to the registration upon the alienation of public lands.\u00a0 \"Applicant\" and \"application\"\u00a0 unquestionably\u00a0 refer to the party\u00a0 and\u00a0 to\u00a0 his pleading in the Court of Land\u00a0 Registration; and although public lands,\u00a0 previous to\u00a0 the issue of patent, are\u00a0 not\u00a0 assessed for\u00a0 taxation, there is no\u00a0 provision under the mining laws\u00a0 whereby the locator of a mineral claim is required at any stage of the proceedings to fix the value of his claim. Defendant requires plaintiff\u00a0 to file the affidavits of three disinterested\u00a0 persons that the\u00a0 value\u00a0 fixed\u00a0 by plaintiff is fair.\u00a0 This requirement is evidently based upon section 99 as amended, and its inapplicability is evident from the fact that plaintiff has never fixed any value, as that was\u00a0 wholly unnecessary in the proceeding he took.<br\/><br\/>Again, section 99, as\u00a0 amended, provides that\u00a0 in case of a subdivision after the last assessment, if there is disagreement between the tax collector and the applicant the question shall be submitted to\u00a0 the court for decision; and that if the value fixed by the applicant should appear, u<i>pon\u00a0 the hearing<\/i>, too small, the\u00a0 court is authorized\u00a0 to increase it. This\u00a0 indicates beyond\u00a0 question that\u00a0\u00a0 section\u00a0 99 has\u00a0 reference only to \"original registration,\" that is\u00a0 to\u00a0 say, to registration upon a decree of\u00a0 court.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 the proceedings by this\u00a0 plaintiff for a title to his mineral claim, no court has intervened.<br\/><br\/>An examination\u00a0 of section\u00a0 122 of the Land Registration Act\u00a0 confirms the\u00a0 interpretation\u00a0 which I have given to section\u00a0 99.\u00a0 It is there provided that upon the filing with the register of a patent\u00a0 for public land, it shall\u00a0 be <i>\"registered like other deeds and conveyances<\/i>, whereupon\u00a0 a\u00a0 certificate shall be entered as in other cases of registered land.\" There is no provision in the Land Registration Act for a payment to the insurance fund\u00a0 upon the registration of deeds and conveyances.\u00a0\u00a0 Such payment is made only upon \"<i>original registration\"<\/i>\u00a0 (with the single\u00a0 exception\u00a0 of\u00a0 the registration of\u00a0 inheritances\u00a0 and\u00a0 devises).\u00a0 Registration upon a judicial decree, under sections 19\u00a0 to 49, is a ratification of an existing title; while a registration under section 122,\u00a0 as\u00a0 in\u00a0 the case of \"other deeds\u00a0 and\u00a0 conveyances,\" is the certification\u00a0 of a\u00a0 new\u00a0 title to the grantee.\u00a0 Registration,\u00a0 under section 122, is therefore analogous to the entry of a\u00a0 certificate under\u00a0 section 57, rather than to the\u00a0 entry of an original certificate under sections\u00a0 41\u00a0 and 42.<br\/><br\/>Again, section 122 provides: \"The fees for registration shall\u00a0 be paid by the grantee.\"\u00a0 It is clear that the insurance premium provided for in section 99 is not a fee in any real sense,\u00a0 and it would seem\u00a0 to be\u00a0 equally clear that if the legislature had intended to require a patentee of public lands to pay the insurance premium, section 122 would have so stated.<br\/><br\/>That the Philippine Commission understood the phrase \"original registration\u00a0 under this\u00a0 Act\" meant only registration upon a decree\u00a0 of the Land Court,\u00a0 as distinguished from\u00a0 registration upon\u00a0 the issue\u00a0 of\u00a0 a patent, is\u00a0 also apparent\u00a0 from an\u00a0 examination of\u00a0 Act No. 926, the Public Land Act, enacted in\u00a0 pursuance\u00a0 of\u00a0 the provisions of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902.\u00a0 The\u00a0 Public Land Act provides for the alienation of the public domain in six several ways: homesteads on the\u00a0 public domain;\u00a0 sales of portions of the public\u00a0 domain;\u00a0 leases of portions of the public domain; free patents to native settlers; town sites; and unperfected titles and Spanish grants and concessions. It provides that unperfected titles and Spanish grants shall be perfected by proceedings in the Court of Land Registration\u00a0 leading to a decree\u00a0 and the issue of\u00a0 a certificate thereon\u00a0 (sec. 63\u00a0 of Act\u00a0 No. 926).\u00a0 All the other methods of alienation\u00a0 are administrative\u00a0 proceedings under the direction of the\u00a0 Bureau\u00a0 of Lands, and lead to the\u00a0 issue of patents which are\u00a0 to\u00a0 be converted into\u00a0 certificates of title in accordance with the provisions of section 122 of Act No. 496\u00a0 (see\u00a0 sec. 73\u00a0 of\u00a0 Act No.\u00a0 926).\u00a0\u00a0 There can be no reason why an insurance\u00a0 premium should be collected from native settlers entitled to\u00a0 free patents, and none from applicants for the perfection of incomplete Spanish' grants; and yet we\u00a0 find that\u00a0 by the last sentence of section 57 of Act No. 926 the latter class are specifically exempted from the\u00a0 payment of this\u00a0 insurance premium.\u00a0 It must,\u00a0 therefore, have been the understanding of the Commission that specific exemption was\u00a0 unnecessary in the case of persons obtaining patents\u00a0 through\u00a0 the Bureau\u00a0 of Lands, for the reason that the issue of certificates upon such patents\u00a0 is not\u00a0 included in \"original registration,\"\u00a0 as used in section 99 of Act No. 496,\u00a0 and\u00a0 that such exemption was necessary in cases where the certificates were issued upon a decree of the Court of Land Registration.<br\/><br\/>I have thus stated affirmatively the argument in a general way deducible\u00a0 in favor of\u00a0 plaintiff's case from the\u00a0 plain provisions of\u00a0 the\u00a0\u00a0 laws\u00a0 invoked to sustain\u00a0 the majority opinion in this\u00a0 case,\u00a0 I\u00a0 now propose, in an amplification of those arguments, to examine the positions successively taken by the court in its opinion as it advanced the final conclusion.<br\/><br\/>It must be borne always in\u00a0 mind that the court in its opinion is continually comparing two proceedings,\u00a0 one a purely administrative proceeding for a patent\u00a0 to public lands, that is,\u00a0 a proceeding to obtain title, and\u00a0 the other a\u00a0 purely judicial\u00a0 proceeding\u00a0 to register\u00a0 a title already acquired; and by such comparison drawing the conclusions upon which its judgment is based.\u00a0\u00a0 The court quotes as the basis of and reason for its\u00a0 decision no law but the Public Land Law (No. 926)\u00a0 and the Torrens Law (No. 496), the one providing for the administrative proceeding for a title and\u00a0 the other the judicial\u00a0 proceeding\u00a0 upon a title <i>already acquired.<\/i>\u00a0 The decision\u00a0 admits, in effect, that the provisions of the Public Land\u00a0 Law (No. 926), the law which provides how and under what conditions a patent to\u00a0 public lands may be obtained,\u00a0 do not <i>expressly<\/i> require an insurance premium to be paid as a part of such\u00a0 proceeding, in other words, that the payment of an insurance premium or assessment is not, under said\u00a0 law, a\u00a0 part\u00a0 of the proceeding,\u00a0 a condition precedent to obtain title.\u00a0 This admission is unquestionably in accordance with the fact.\u00a0 Nowhere in said law is there\u00a0 the slightest mention of the insurance premium or assurance fund.\u00a0\u00a0 The opinion also admits,\u00a0 in the same way, that the provisions of the Torrens Law (Act No. 496), which\u00a0 require the payment of\u00a0 an\u00a0 insurance\u00a0 premium\u00a0 or assessment as a condition precedent to the registration of title, do not expressly require the payment of such premium or assessment in proceedings under the Public Land Law. This admission is also unquestionably in accordance\u00a0 with the fact; for nowhere in Act No.\u00a0 496, the Torrens Law, is\u00a0 there any express provision requiring such payment to be made.\u00a0 Summarizing\u00a0 these admissions of the court, it is\u00a0 unquestioned\u00a0 that there is no law\u00a0 anywhere expressly requiring the payment of an insurance assessment in proceedings to obtain a\u00a0 patent to public lands.\u00a0\u00a0 This is necessarily so.\u00a0 If it were not, there\u00a0 would have been no cause of this character here and these opinions would\u00a0 not\u00a0 have been written.\u00a0 The provision requiring payment would have been expressed and no question\u00a0 concerning the necessity of its payment\u00a0 could have arisen.<br\/><br\/>As a result of this, the\u00a0 necessity\u00a0 for such payment must be interpreted, construed, spelled, implied out of the law, or the payment can not\u00a0 be required.\u00a0 That\u00a0 is what the court has done.\u00a0 It has compared and analyzed and inferred and deduced in order to require the payment.<br\/><br\/>It is a universal maxim of statutory construction\u00a0 that where the meaning of a statute is doubtful, the\u00a0 construction most in\u00a0 accordance\u00a0 with reason\u00a0 and justice should be adopted; for it\u00a0 will\u00a0 not\u00a0 be\u00a0 presumed\u00a0 that the legislature contemplated unreason or injustice.\u00a0 The construction given by the court to the statutes\u00a0 involved in the case at bar is, in\u00a0 my humble judgment,\u00a0 unjust and unreasonable.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u00a0 have so much confidence in the judgment\u00a0 of my associates and so little in my own that only\u00a0 the sternest necessity,\u00a0 as\u00a0 I regard it, induces me to dissent from the\u00a0 decision of the court in this\u00a0 case.\u00a0 If the decision did not\u00a0 involve,\u00a0 in my humble judgment, a\u00a0 misapprehension of the\u00a0 nature and purposes\u00a0 of the Torrens\u00a0 Law,\u00a0 and an\u00a0 opposition to the policy of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Government in relation to the\u00a0 public lands, I would not permit myself to dissent.<br\/><br\/>The sole question is whether an individual who has purchased\u00a0 from the Government\u00a0 a\u00a0 portion\u00a0 of its\u00a0 public land and paid\u00a0 to the\u00a0 Government the value thereof\u00a0 as fixed by law, shall then be required, before he can register the deed which the Government has given\u00a0 him, to pay to the Government a further\u00a0 sum\u00a0 to\u00a0 insure\u00a0 the very title which the Government has just\u00a0 given him.\u00a0 In other words, must a vendee for full value himself protect the title\u00a0 of the vendor? That is\u00a0 to\u00a0 say,\u00a0 must\u00a0 the\u00a0 vendee, in\u00a0 the\u00a0 absence of his agreement to\u00a0 do\u00a0 so, warrant the title of\u00a0 the vendor?\u00a0 The decision\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 court in\u00a0 this\u00a0 case says \"yes.\"\u00a0 For this reversal of\u00a0 every principle of law and justice\u00a0 relating to real estate\u00a0 uninterruptedly applied in\u00a0 every part\u00a0 of the civilized world\u00a0 from\u00a0 Justinian\u00a0 to Blackstone and\u00a0 from Blackstone to Washburn,\u00a0 some\u00a0 solid\u00a0 reason ought\u00a0 to\u00a0 be given.\u00a0 Such\u00a0 reason can not justly be construed by tortuous process\u00a0 out of a doubtful situation.\u00a0 It should not be necessary to spend pages in confrontation of\u00a0 laws, in comparison of phraseology, in interpretation and substitution of words and\u00a0 sentences, in\u00a0 close\u00a0 and intricate analysis, in strained construction and uncertain interpretation, in order to find such reason.\u00a0 It should, in fairness and in justice, be so clear\u00a0 and\u00a0 plain as\u00a0 to leave\u00a0 absolutely no room for doubt.\u00a0 It is an\u00a0 invariable rule\u00a0 of statutory construction and interpretation, as I have said before, that a statute will never be construed so\u00a0 as to work injustice. To produce such a result the terms of the law must be\u00a0 so plain as to require no construction.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff\u00a0 in\u00a0 this case bought mining\u00a0 lands of the Government.\u00a0 He paid the full\u00a0 purchase price therefor. The\u00a0 Government granted him\u00a0 a\u00a0 patent.\u00a0 When\u00a0 it\u00a0 was sought to record this\u00a0 patent\u00a0 in\u00a0 the office of the register that functionary\u00a0 refused to register it, unless the plaintiff should pay to the Government a certain sum to warrant the validity of that title.<br\/><br\/>It may be said, as the opinion indicates,\u00a0 that the payment to the assurance fund is not to protect the patentee, but the person who may be injured by the bringing of the patentee's title under the Torrens Law; that it is\u00a0 not the benefit to the\u00a0 patentee but to the person injured by the operation of the law which is the basis of the requirement to pay.\u00a0 But the instant reply is that if the person\u00a0 who pays\u00a0 gets no benefit, why should he\u00a0 pay?\u00a0 It is\u00a0 unjust, unfair, if not absolutely unconstitutional, to require one to part with his property without consideration.\u00a0 No law may compel one\u00a0 to\u00a0 pay\u00a0 money solely\u00a0 to\u00a0 benefit\u00a0 some one else. He must be\u00a0 the one benefited\u00a0 if\u00a0 he\u00a0 pays.\u00a0 The only legal basis upon which the Torrens Law\u00a0 can stand is that the one who pays\u00a0 is the one who benefits.\u00a0\u00a0 If, on the other hand, it be held that the\u00a0 patentee is benefited by the payment in that his\u00a0 title\u00a0 is thereafter\u00a0 absolutely guaranteed, that the land itself can never be taken\u00a0 away from him by reason of defects in the Government's title, the reply comes that the patentee, having paid the full consideration required by\u00a0 the\u00a0 Government,\u00a0 and having obtained title from\u00a0 the Government, his\u00a0 title is already\u00a0 guaranteed.\u00a0 Can a title be better guaranteed than by having the\u00a0 Government itself back of it?\u00a0\u00a0 What more can the Torrens Law offer\u00a0 by way of a warranty than the power and resources of the Government itself?\u00a0 Nothing\u00a0 whatever. The\u00a0 Government may repeal the Torrens Law utterly\u00a0 and apply the assurance fund\u00a0 to\u00a0 other\u00a0 purposes, but\u00a0 it\u00a0 can not, except\u00a0 by\u00a0 the odious and\u00a0 infamous process\u00a0 of repudiation, escape its contract\u00a0 with a patentee to protect his\u00a0 title.\u00a0 When\u00a0 the patentee paid\u00a0 P25 per\u00a0 hectare,\u00a0 the full purchase price of the public land bought as fixed\u00a0 by law, he then and there paid the full consideration for a warranty of title.\u00a0\u00a0 It could not have been intended that he pay a whole purchase price and\u00a0 get\u00a0 <i>half <\/i>a title.\u00a0\u00a0 It could not have been presumed that he should pay a sound price\u00a0 and get an unsound title. The Government\u00a0 which rigidly enforces\u00a0 the maxim that a sound price\u00a0 imports a\u00a0 sound article\u00a0 among its\u00a0 citizens can not in decency refuse to apply\u00a0 that doctrine to itself. This\u00a0 being so, what is there of equity, fairness, or justice in the requirement that the patentee in this case shall again pay for the protection of his\u00a0 title?\u00a0 Why should he pay twice for the same thing?<br\/><br\/>But it\u00a0 may be said that the Government's warranty of title\u00a0 on the\u00a0 sale is merely\u00a0 a covenant running with\u00a0 the land\u00a0 and\u00a0 does not insure\u00a0 to the patentee <i>the land itself<\/i>; that\u00a0 section\u00a0 122, by\u00a0 bringing the title under the\u00a0 Torrens Law,\u00a0 insures that the patentee shall retain the land itself whatever\u00a0 the defect\u00a0 in\u00a0 the Government's title may have been; and that the patentee, being thus assured of something more\u00a0 than he would get\u00a0 under a covenant of warranty, should pay for it.\u00a0 In reply it\u00a0 may be noted, in the first place, that the fact that the <i>land itself<\/i> is assured to\u00a0 the patentee\u00a0 constitutes\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 law no\u00a0 greater consideration than\u00a0 the\u00a0 covenant of warranty.\u00a0 In the eyes of\u00a0 the\u00a0 law the one is as valuable as\u00a0 the other.\u00a0 Moreover, if should be observed\u00a0 that inasmuch\u00a0 as\u00a0 section 122\u00a0 provides\u00a0 that the issuance and delivery\u00a0 of the patent\u00a0 do not\u00a0 actually transfer the\u00a0 title but operate merely as a contract\u00a0 between the Government\u00a0 and the patentee, and that the operative act to transfer\u00a0 the title\u00a0 is the <i>registration<\/i>,\u00a0 it is evident that the assurance assessment is paid while the title is\u00a0 yet in the Government.\u00a0 Why,\u00a0 then, is the Government\u00a0 not justly the one to pay this assessment, if anyone is to pay it?\u00a0 If anyone is being injured, he\u00a0 is that one, and he is injured by reason of the Government selling lands which do not belong to\u00a0 it.\u00a0\u00a0 The patentee pays and gets for such payment\u00a0 absolutely\u00a0 nothing in the\u00a0 eye of\u00a0 the law that he did not already have.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted, also,\u00a0 that the payment\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 assurance fund, under the Torrens Law itself, is purely voluntary.\u00a0 One is not obliged to apply for the registration of his title under that law.\u00a0 It is wholly optional\u00a0\u00a0 One may leave his title as it was before the passage of that law.\u00a0\u00a0 The Legislature, in enacting that law, was very careful not to make registration compulsory.\u00a0\u00a0 One may assume the risk himself.\u00a0 It was very careful also to provide that no title should suffer by reason of a failure to register.\u00a0 Under the holding of the court in this case,\u00a0 however, no choice is left to a patentee..\u00a0 He must come\u00a0 under that\u00a0 law willy nilly.\u00a0 He must pay whether he will\u00a0 or not.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is of no significance that he is satisified with the title the Government gives him and\u00a0 wishes no further guaranty than the Government itself. It is of no consequence that he is willing to assume\u00a0 the risk himself.\u00a0 He must take what the law offers whether he will or not, and whether it really\u00a0 benefits him or not; and\u00a0 he must pay for it, too.\u00a0 I maintain that such a construction is unfair and unjust.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no reason whatever why one\u00a0 who comes under the Torrens Law by virtue of having purchased land\u00a0 from the Government should be <i>obliged<\/i> to pay, while all\u00a0 other\u00a0 owners or purchasers of real estate <i>may pay or not as\u00a0 they please. <\/i> One who purchases public\u00a0 lands is\u00a0 assisting in carrying out a\u00a0 great Government program, that of\u00a0 the\u00a0 development of the\u00a0 resources of the Islands.\u00a0\u00a0 It is the manifest purpose of\u00a0 the Insular Government to exploit\u00a0 the great mineral wealth of this\u00a0 country; to induce as\u00a0 many\u00a0 deserving persons as possible to take up homesteads; to develop the wealth of\u00a0 the forests;\u00a0 in short, to make\u00a0 earth, field, and forest yield up their riches.\u00a0 To\u00a0 fasten upon every\u00a0 person who desires to enter with heart and hand into this scheme of the Government an obligatory\u00a0 payment as a\u00a0 condition precedent to such cooperation is, to the extent of that obligation, to present an obstruction and a hindrance in the way of\u00a0 the Government's\u00a0 policy.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, the Torrens Law, by\u00a0 its\u00a0 very terms, applies only\u00a0 to titles <i>already acquired<\/i>.\u00a0 It does not apply to\u00a0 the <i>process of acquiring<\/i> title.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0 simply\u00a0 registers a title\u00a0 already vested.\u00a0\u00a0 It does not pretend in any way to make compliance with any of its\u00a0 provisions a condition precedent to the <i>vesting<\/i> of a title.\u00a0\u00a0 <i>It begins to operate only after\u00a0 the title\u00a0 is vested. <\/i> Section 19 of that law provides,\u00a0 in part: \"Application\u00a0 for\u00a0 registration\u00a0 of title\u00a0 may be made by the following persons, namely:<br\/><blockquote>\"First. The person or persons claiming, singly or collectively,<i> to own the legal estate\u00a0 in fee simple.<\/i>\"<\/blockquote>By section 21 the application must contain the statement that\u00a0 the applicant\u00a0 is \"the\u00a0 owner in fee simple\u00a0 (or by possessory information)\" of\u00a0 the land the title to which is to be registered.\u00a0 That is to say, that before one is allowed even\u00a0 to\u00a0 initiate the proceedings\u00a0 by which the title is\u00a0 registered,\u00a0 he\u00a0 must be the owner\u00a0 of the premises\u00a0 or have such\u00a0 interest therein\u00a0 as the law\u00a0 requires.\u00a0 The\u00a0 purpose of the law is to insure or assure a title <i>already vested.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 It was never intended to be a means of obtaining\u00a0 title or to be a <i> step in\u00a0 or a part\u00a0 of<\/i> the proceedings by which that title was obtained.\u00a0\u00a0 This being so, section 122, Act No. 496, has no such significance or meaning as is given to it by the opinion of the court in this case.\u00a0 That section provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Whenever public lands in the Philippine Islands belonging to the Government of the United States or to the Government of the Philippine\u00a0 Islands are alienated, granted, or conveyed to persons or\u00a0 to public or private corporations, the same shall\u00a0 be brought\u00a0 forthwith under the operation of this Act and shall become\u00a0 registered lands.\u00a0 It\u00a0 shall be the duty of the official issuing the instrument of alienation, grant, or conveyance in behalf of the Government to cause such\u00a0 instrument, before its delivery\u00a0 to the grantee, to be filed with the register of deeds for the province where the land lies and to be there registered like other deeds and conveyances, whereupon\u00a0 a certificate\u00a0 shall be entered as in other cases\u00a0 of registered land, and\u00a0 an owner's duplicate certificate issued to\u00a0 the\u00a0 grantee.\u00a0 The deed,\u00a0 grant, or instrument of conveyance from the Government to the grantee shall not take effect as a conveyance to bind\u00a0 the land,\u00a0 but shall\u00a0 operate only as a contract between the\u00a0 Government and the\u00a0 grantee and as evidence of the authority to\u00a0 the clerk\u00a0 or\u00a0 register of deeds to\u00a0 make the registration.\u00a0 The act of registration shall be the operative act\u00a0 to convey and affect the lands, and in all cases under this Act registration shall be made in the office of the register of deeds for the province where the land lies.\u00a0 The fees for registration shall be paid by the grantee.\u00a0 After due registration and issue of the certificate and owner's duplicate such land shall be registered land for all purposes under this Act.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It provides, as is seen, that \"whenever\u00a0 public lands *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 are conveyed\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 the same shall be brought forthwith under the operation of this Act and shall oecome registered\u00a0 lands,\"\u00a0 This\u00a0 unquestionably\u00a0 means\u00a0 that the instant the sale is completed that instant they become registered lands; that\u00a0 when one proceeding, namely,\u00a0 the administrative proceeding for a\u00a0 patent under Act No. 926, is\u00a0 completed,\u00a0 its results shall be the same, so far as the unimpeachability of the title is concerned, as are the results which\u00a0 follow the judicial proceeding under Act. No. 496. But it emphatically does not say that\u00a0 any proceeding or any payment\u00a0 which is a condition precedent to that registration under the Torrens Law shall also be indispensable to the proceeding under the Public\u00a0 Land Law.\u00a0\u00a0 When a proceeding under the Public Land Law is complete that is an end of it.\u00a0\u00a0 It can not, without express provision of law, be opened in order to put in\u00a0 another condition to the completion of the\u00a0 proceeding.\u00a0\u00a0 The evident intention\u00a0 of that section, as it is also of the Public Land Law, Act No. 926, is to keep the\u00a0 two proceedings wholly separate and\u00a0 distinct <i>while\u00a0 they are in progress<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0 Each one shall proceed according to its\u00a0 own law,\u00a0 taking\u00a0 its own forms,\u00a0 pursuing\u00a0 its own methods,\u00a0 involving its own costs\u00a0 and\u00a0 expenses\u00a0 and <i>providing\u00a0 for its own fees and disbursements.\u00a0 The\u00a0 two proceedings,<\/i> as such, never touch,\u00a0 never come in contact. They are never involved with each other until both are fully terminated.\u00a0\u00a0 Even\u00a0 then\u00a0 they do not touch.\u00a0\u00a0 They simply have the same result by express provision of law; and that provision\u00a0 of law does absolutely nothing else than to affect <i>results.<\/i>\u00a0 It does not affect or touch <i>proceedings to obtain results.<\/i> That this is the intention of section 122 is apparent from the provisions of the Public Land Law, Act No, 926. Under that law public lands may be patented for any one of six different purposes.\u00a0 There is a separate and distinct proceeding required in each case.\u00a0 Each proceeding is complete in itself.\u00a0\u00a0 The law states specifically and in detail what the applicant must do and what he must pay to obtain a patent. It also states that when he has done those things his patent shall be issued\u00a0 to him.\u00a0\u00a0 He has done\u00a0 everything that the law requires.\u00a0\u00a0 He has\u00a0 paid his full\u00a0 consideration.\u00a0 The proceeding is then complete\u00a0 in all of its essential features. Nothing remains to be done but to record the patent.\u00a0 This is purely a clerical matter in no sense affecting the essentials of the proceeding.\u00a0 But\u00a0 even\u00a0 this the patentee is not\u00a0 required to do.\u00a0 Section 122 expressly provides that the official shall cause the\u00a0 patent to be registered.\u00a0 It says: \"It shall be <i>the duty of the official issuing the instrument of alienation\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 to cause such instrument, before its delivery to the grantee,\u00a0 to\u00a0 be filed with\u00a0 the register of deeds <\/i>for the province where the land lies\u00a0 <i>and to be there registered like\u00a0 other deeds and conveyances <\/i>\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.\"<br\/><br\/>The quotation clearly concedes\u00a0 that the patentee has done all\u00a0 that the law requires him to do in order to bfhd the Government legally and morally\u00a0 to\u00a0 give\u00a0 him a title.\u00a0 The remainder, whatever it is, must be done by the Government itself.\u00a0 That title,\u00a0 having the Government\u00a0 back of it, is as good as it can be.\u00a0\u00a0 Nothing can be added to it; nothing can be taken away from it.\u00a0 He stands upon the proceedings he has taken, upon consideration he has paid, and justly demands his title.<br\/><br\/>But, says the\u00a0 opinion of the court, and this is the central point of the decision, section 122 provides that \"the fees for registration shall\u00a0 be\u00a0 paid by the grantee;\" and\u00a0 then asks, in substance, \"does this not mean that he shall pay the insurance fund assessment, and if not, why not?\"\u00a0 The answer is\u00a0 \"no;\" and\u00a0 the\u00a0 reason\u00a0 is that the\u00a0 plain and unmistakable language of the section\u00a0 shows clearly that\u00a0 no such thing was\u00a0 intended\u00a0 or thought of.\u00a0 The section says that he shall\u00a0 pay the \"fees\u00a0 for\u00a0 <i>registration\"<\/i> not an <i>assurance fund<\/i> fee or assessment.\u00a0 The phrase \"fees for <i>registration\"<\/i> means what it says.\u00a0 It is an\u00a0 expression well known to the law.\u00a0 It has a known and definite signification. It is a fee for <i>registration<\/i>, not for insurance.\u00a0 It is something paid to a Government official for services performed by that official for the benefit of the payer\u00a0 and not a thing paid to\u00a0 the\u00a0 Government in trust for someone\u00a0 that the Government\u00a0 has unjustly deprived of his\u00a0 property.\u00a0\u00a0 It is a payment for valuable services rendered to the payee and not to purchase immunity for the Government or\u00a0 some one else\u00a0 for its\u00a0 or his unjust and spoliative\u00a0 acts committed against another.\u00a0\u00a0 To hold that the expression\u00a0 \"fees for registration\" includes\u00a0 an assessment for an insurance is fo violate language and rob it of its significance.<br\/><br\/>Moreover,\u00a0 if anything more were needed to demonstrate the error involved in the construction given to said phrase by the court, it will be found in\u00a0 section 114 of the same Act. Act\u00a0 No. 496 is divided into headings, such as \"Assurance Fund,\" \"Powers of Attorney,\" \"Lost Duplicate Certificates,\" \"Adverse Claims,\"\u00a0 \"Surrender of Duplicate Certificates,\" etc.\u00a0 One of the divisions is headed in capital letters, \"FEES FOR REGISTRATION.\"\u00a0 Under this heading comes every charge which may be made, as a fee, from the beginning of the proceeding to its close.\u00a0\u00a0 That section reads:<br\/><blockquote><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\"FEES FOR REGISTRATION.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"SEC. 114.\u00a0 Fees payable under this Act shall be as

decree\u00a0 of\u00a0 registration,\u00a0 and for entry of original certificate of title and issuing one duplicate shall be ten dollars.\"<\/blockquote>Certainly the necessity\u00a0 of a payment to the insurance fund is not found here.<br\/><br\/>The Public Land\u00a0 Law\u00a0 requires the payment of no fees whatever except in cases of \"unperfected titles and Spanish grants and concessions,\" and to establish the titles in those it is required by the law that <i>the full and complete proceeding\u00a0 under the Torrens Law must be taken.<\/i>\u00a0 In\u00a0 those cases the same payments are made as in the regular proceeding, except that to the assurance fund.\u00a0 In this law, then, there is no provision for\u00a0 fees which can possibly be construed to\u00a0 include a payment to the assurance fund.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, section 122\u00a0 provides, as we have\u00a0 seen, that the patent shall be\u00a0 \"registered like other deeds and conveyances.\"\u00a0 These\u00a0 words, \"deeds\u00a0 and conveyances,\" certainly can not mean the certified copy of the court's final decree in the judicial proceeding under Act No. 496, which is the instrument transmitted by the clerk of the court to the\u00a0 register\u00a0 of\u00a0 deeds in\u00a0 the\u00a0 province\u00a0 where the\u00a0 land lies, to be there registered as the final act of the proceeding; for the reason that neither such certified copy of the final decree nor the final decree itself is a\u00a0 \"deed\" or \"conveyance.\"\u00a0 As I\u00a0 have said before,\u00a0 it transfers no title whatever; it conveys nothing.\u00a0 The person\u00a0 instituting the proceedings\u00a0 had\u00a0 title before\u00a0 he began.\u00a0 He was the\u00a0 owner before he made the application.\u00a0\u00a0 He must be such under the law.\u00a0 The words\u00a0 \"deed,\" \"conveyance\" mean unquestionably an instrument which transfers a title to or interest in real property from one person to\u00a0 another.\u00a0 Inasmuch as the registration of title under the Torrens Law <i>transfers absolutely nothing,<\/i> such registration can not possibly mean \"deeds and conveyances\" as those words are used in section 122.\u00a0\u00a0 This is a complete reply to\u00a0 that portion\u00a0 of the opinion which, after quoting\u00a0 from section 122 the\u00a0 words \"to be there registered like other deeds and conveyances,\" says: \"What\u00a0 does this phrase 'like other deeds and\u00a0 conveyances,' when\u00a0 applied to these\u00a0 patents\u00a0 and the registration of the\u00a0 same, mean ?\u00a0 It can only mean titles\u00a0 issued under said Act\u00a0 No.\u00a0 496.\"\u00a0 The fundamental error embedded\u00a0 in this\u00a0 quotation,\u00a0 and\u00a0 it runs\u00a0 all\u00a0 through\u00a0 the decision, is that the Torrens Law <i>grants<\/i> or \"issues titles.\" The\u00a0 law does\u00a0 nothing of the\u00a0 kind.\u00a0 It <i>guarantees <\/i>a\u00a0 title <i>already \"issued\"<\/i> or vested.\u00a0\u00a0 As\u00a0 I have said repeatedly, the very first\u00a0 condition precedent to the institution\u00a0 of the proceeding under that law is that the <i>applicant must\u00a0 be the owner;<\/i>\u00a0 and that law\u00a0 specifically provides that if, during the proceedings, <i>it appears that he is\u00a0 not the owner the proceedings must be dismissed.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 The

The\u00a0 state,\u00a0 and it\u00a0 is the state acting through the law, can grant no rights which it does not have, can issue or grant no title which it\u00a0 does not possess.\u00a0 Its very purpose in promulgating the Torrens Law was to confirm a title which a court should find, after a judicial trial in an\u00a0 ordinary action, to\u00a0 have been legally vested in the applicant at the time the action was\u00a0 instituted.\u00a0\u00a0 It confirms,\u00a0 not grants.\u00a0 It guarantees, not transfers.\u00a0\u00a0 Section 38\u00a0 provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"If the court\u00a0 after hearing finds that the applicant has title as stated in his application, and\u00a0 proper for registration,\u00a0 a decree\u00a0 of <i>confirmation and registration<\/i>\u00a0 shall\u00a0 be entered\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Therefore, when section 122\u00a0 used the words \"to be there registered\u00a0 like other deeds and\u00a0 conveyances\" it\u00a0 did not, by said words, in any sense refer to the final decree, or a certified copy thereof, as\u00a0 defined in the\u00a0 Torrens Law.\u00a0\u00a0 It simply meant that the patent inasmuch as\u00a0 it is a deed\u00a0 or conveyance, should be registered or recorded in the same manner\u00a0 as\u00a0 any other deed\u00a0 or conveyance.\u00a0 That patent granted and\u00a0 transferred a title,\u00a0 an ownership, in exactly the same manner as would a deed of\u00a0 conveyance between John\u00a0 Doe and Richard Roe.\u00a0\u00a0 Why, then, should it be\u00a0 recorded differently or under a different law?<br\/><br\/>All this goes to show simply that the Torrens Law has absolutely nothing to do with the <i>proceedings<\/i> for a patent under the Public Land Law.\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a0 122\u00a0 simply provides what\u00a0 shall be the effect, the result, <i>after\u00a0 the\u00a0 proceedings are terminated.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Entering upon the second phase of the\u00a0 question,\u00a0 I am of the opinion that section 122 of Act\u00a0 No. 496, if it means what\u00a0 the majority of the\u00a0 court\u00a0 conclude\u00a0 it means,\u00a0 is\u00a0 in violation of the\u00a0 Act of July\u00a0 1, 1902.<br\/><br\/>It must be remembered, first of all, that the land involved in this action is <i>mineral <\/i> land.<br\/><br\/>It must be borne in mind also <i>that the only law in force in the Philippine Islands which has to do with the sale\u00a0 of mineral lands is the Act of July 1, 1902.<\/i><br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 of the very\u00a0 greatest\u00a0 importance also to note that the Public Land Law is wholly inapplicable by\u00a0 express provision to the sale of <i>mineral<\/i> lands.<br\/><br\/>This\u00a0 inapplicability was lost\u00a0 sight\u00a0 of\u00a0 by the court in its decision.\u00a0 The opinion attempts to show that the Public Land Law is applicable to the case at bar, and for that purpose refers to said law as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"First.

S. <i>vs.<\/i> Bull, 15 Phil.

It is certainly widely\u00a0 different from the proceedings\u00a0 followed\u00a0 under said Act No. 496.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 view of all this I\u00a0 am confident\u00a0 that the\u00a0 Philippine Government never\u00a0 intended that section 122 of\u00a0 Act No. 496 should be given the meaning\u00a0 accorded it by the decision of\u00a0 this\u00a0 court.<br\/><br\/>Giving section\u00a0 122 all the signification which it was intended to have, it simply requires that a patent t5 mineral lands shall be\u00a0 registered \"like\u00a0 other\u00a0\u00a0 deeds and\u00a0 conveyances.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The provisions\u00a0 of the law are\u00a0 express and mandatory,\u00a0 leaving no\u00a0 discretion whatever in the register of deeds.\u00a0 This is apparent and clear on\u00a0 reading the section. (Marbury<i> vs. <\/i>Madison, 1\u00a0 Cranch., 172.)\u00a0 While the section provides that the official shall cause the patent to be registered, I am\u00a0 of the opinion that the patentee has a sufficient interest to compel\u00a0 the registration.<br\/><br\/>The mandamus should be issued.<br\/><\/div>",

The persons charged with the commission of the crime were the two appellants and one Isaac Fernandez. Fernandez has heretofore been tried and condemned to death for his part in the crime mentioned. On the trial of the two appellants, Fernandez was the principal witness. He alleged in his testimony that some time prior to the day of the murder the accused, Alvaro Falsario, told him that he wanted him to injure Juliana Gadon and Anastacio Gadacho, as he was in a lawsuit with them, and that if he would kill them he would give him some land and a carabao; that this conversation took place prior to the departure of Alvaro for Romblon to be present at the session of the Court of First Instance; that on his return from Romblon, the appellants again spoke to him, saying that they wanted him to kill Juliana and Anastacio, because if they continued to live they would cost the appellants much money by reason of the lawsuit; that they promised to give him a carabao, some land, and 5 <i>cavanes<\/i> oi palay if he procured the death of the persons mentioned; that on a day of the month of February, 1909, Fernandez, at the order of Alvaro Falsario, went to the house of Anastacio and Juliana for the purpose of ascertaining whether they were at home; that, having ascertained that they would be at home that night, at midnight of the same day the witness, Marcos and Alvaro, armed with bolos, went to the house of the deceased; that the witness and Marcos entered the house by way of the kitchen door, while Alvaro remained in the lower part; that on entering the house Marcos Ambrosio attacked the sleeping spouses with his bolo, killing both of them.<br\/><br\/>The witness also testified that while in the jail Marcos and Alvaro told him that if he would not testify against them on the trial they would give him P150 in addition to what they had already promised him.<br\/><br\/>A very lengthy and searching cross-examination failed to affect materially the strength and probative force of the testimony given on the direct examination. In reference to this witness and the value of his testimony, the trial court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The testimony of Isaac Fernandez is the most serious and important evidence against the accused in this case. The court does not forget that the testimony of an accomplice must be scrupulously and carefully examined and received with much caution (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Quiamson, 5 Phil. Rep., 444) ; and that as a general rule an accused ought not to be condemned on the testimony of his coaccused unless it is corroborated to a sufficient extent by other witnesses. (U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Balisacan, 4 Phil. Rep., 545.) Examining carefully the testimony of Isaac Fernandez we find no motive whatever inducing him to swear falsely simply to implicate the accused in this case. On being asked on cross-examination if it was his purpose to incriminate others after having heard sentence of death pronounced against himself, he answered in the negative and stated that, inasmuch as he himself was going to die, he had decided to tell the truth. It is true that in the trial of the cause in which he was defendant he denied not only his own participation in the crime but also that of the accused in this case; but in that case it was satisfactorily proved that he had theretofore and immediately after the commission of the crime, at a time when he had no occasion or opportunity to prepare a defense, made statements amounting to an admission of his own guilt and at the same time showed the connection of the accused in this case with the crime. Those statements formed the basis of a judgment of conviction against him in this court. An attempt was made to show that the only person who had cause or reason to kill Juliana and Anastacio was Isaac Fernandez, the reason being bad feeling which had arisen between them a few days prior to the commission of the crime on account of their refusing to give Isaac a fee or gratuity for having sold a carabao for them. But there is also in the case ample and sufficient proof that the two accused had ill feeling and rancor against the decedents. Alvaro Falsario is father-in-law to Marcos Ambrosio. Bonifacio Falsario, son of the accused Alvaro, was the first husband of one Juliana Gadon. From the time of the marriage of Juliana Gadon to Anastacio Gadacho, her second husband, her father-in-law refused to visit her. Since that time the relations between Alvaro and Juliana have not been cordial. Juliana not only brought action in this court against Alvaro for the recovery of certain lands, which was decided in favor of Juliana Gadon (civil cause No. 117, Court of First Instance of Romblon), but also objected to the accounts presented by Alvaro as administrator of the estate of Bonifacio Falsario and asked for his removal from the office of administrator, and objected to his appointment as guardian of the minor children of the deceased Bonifacio. (Causes Nos. 101 and 103 of the Court of First Instance of Romblon.) When the murder occurred on the 26th of February, they had just returned from Romblon from attendance on a session of the Court of First Instance in relation to matters connected with said administration and guardianship. So that if Isaac had reasons to injure the decedents, so did Alvaro Falsario, almost as serious and as great as those of Isaac. There is nothing improbable nor contradictory in reality in the idea that Alvaro knowing that Isaac had a grudge against Juliana and Anastacio improved the opportunity to secure relief from the spouses, Juliana and Anastacio, he proposing to Isaac that they act together, the latter being younger, bolder, and more ignorant.\"<\/blockquote>In our opinion the reasons and arguments expressed in the above quotation entirely dispose of the objections made by counsel for the defense against the probative value of the testimony of Isaac Fernandez.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of Fernandez is corroborated by that of Estanislao Gadacho, a boy 10 years of age, son of the. deceased spouses, who was sleeping near his parents at the time they were murdered. He testified that on the night in question he awoke on hearing a noise and saw within the house Marcos Ambrosio and Isaac Fernandez, who, after stabbing his parents with their bolos, stealthily descended from the house; that at first he thought that his parents were fighting and that the person who had gone out of the house was his father, but on going out of the house himself he saw that those who had descended from the house were Isaac Fernandez and Marcos Ambrosio; that he also saw the accused Alvaro Falsario, who was in the lower part of the house seated on his heels, tracing something upon the floor.<br\/><br\/>The defense attacks vigorously the testimony of this boy on the ground that in giving his evidence he involved himself in conflicting statements. That the witness did make dissimilar, if not conflicting, statements in his declaration is undoubtedly true. The trial court took due notice thereof and in connection therewith had this to say:<br\/><blockquote>\"The testimony of this boy on the trial, it is true, evinced certain indecision and lack of assurance, perhaps by reason of the difficulty which he experienced in coordinating his ideas, he being 10 years of age, so much so that he has made some contradictory statements. But if the statement of this boy of itself should not be sufficient to justify conviction, it may serve, however, for the purpose of corroborating the statement of Isaac Fernandez upon the main point, to wit, that Isaac Fernandez did not go to the house by himself, but was accompanied by another person. Each one of the decedents received several wounds on different parts of the body. Given the rapidity with which these wounds were inflicted and the unusual noises which were heard by the children of the house, who were thereby awakened, it is almost impossible that one man acting alone could have committed this crime. He must have been assisted by somebody else in carrying out such a barbarous and cruel deed at such a late hour of the night.\"<\/blockquote>The defense interposed in this case was an alibi. To establish this defense the defendants themselves testified and were supported in such declarations by the testimony of Mamerto Gara, Apolonia Falsario, Filomena Falsario, Espiridion Salido, Francisco Motin, and Bernarda Falsario. They united in alleging that during the night of the murder the accused had remained in their house on account of illness from which they were both suffering at the time, the one being afflicted with dysentery and the other with malaria. In relation to the testimony of these witnesses it may be said that the witness Francisco Motin apparently does not refer in his declaration to the time of the commission of the murder. All of the other witnesses are near relatives of the accused and lived with them in the same house. Mamerto Gara is a son-in-law of Alvaro Falsario and a brother- in-law of Marcos Ambrosio. Apolonia Falsario is a sister of Alvaro Falsario, while Filomena Falsario and Espiridion Salido are grandchildren of Alvaro Falsario. Bernarda Falsario is the wife of Marcos Ambrosio and daughter of Alvaro Falsario.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the testimony given in favor of the defense, the trial court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The sole defense of the accused is an alibi. In our mind, in the majority of cases the proof is weak and insufficient to destroy the force of the evidence of the prosecution.\u00a0\u00a0 The accused attempted to show that on the day in question and for some time thereafter they were ill in bed and for that reason were not able to leave the house. The proofs in this particular have the same defect as those presented to prove the alibi. All of the witnesses called for the purpose of establishing these facts, with some exceptions, are persons bound by intimate ties of relationship to the accused and living with them under the same roof.\"<\/blockquote>The defense places considerable stress upon the testimony of Pilar Falsario, a daughter of the decedents, who was sleeping in an adjoining house on the night of the murder. This witness testified that she was awakened by a noise or commotion in her parents' house; that she ran out of the house and climbed into a tree; that while watching and listening she saw a man leap out of her father's house and heard her mother cry, \"Help, Pilar,\" that immediately on hearing these words she ran away to the house of her grandmother, to, whom she stated that she had heard her mother crying for help and that she had heard loud noises issuing from her mother's house; that her grandmother, as well as she, was afraid to go to her mother's house. The defense alleges that the fact that this witness saw only one man issue from her mother's house indicates clearly that the murder was the work of one man and that man must have been Isaac Fernandez. This testimony would have considerable force if it appeared definitely and clearly from the proofs of the case that Fernandez and Marcos issued from the house at all times together. While it is not entirely clear from the proofs of the prosecution, taken altogether, nevertheless, it seems to be the legitimate inference from the testimony given that Marcos went out of the house ahead of Fernandez. It appears, however, from a portion of the testimony that after Marcos left the house, Isaac remained long enough to conduct Estanislao to the \"casa de Monay;\" that he then returned to the house where the corpses were lying, and, having looked at them again, went out. Thus Isaac must have issued from the house more than once and possibly alone.<br\/><br\/>It is undoubted that if the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution is true, the defendants were properly convicted. The only question presented for our consideration is one of fact. The appellants allege that the testimony is insufficient to show their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Whether this is so or not depends entirely upon who told the truth. There is nothing inherently improbable in the story told by Fernandez and corroborated by Estanislao. The defendants were in trouble and had been in trouble for some time with the deceased. Bad blood admittedly existed between them. It does not appear that anyone else in that community had the slightest reason for injuring the deceased persons. No robbery was committed. No property was taken. No injury to the premises was committed. The motive which the person or persons had who committed the crime was directed against the Gadachos personally. The crime was vindictive, not lucrative. It was to satisfy rancor, not to obtain money. It was to destroy life, not property.<br\/><br\/>It is unquestionably true that the testimony of an accomplice must be taken with great care and caution. It must be assayed and weighed with scrupulous care. The corroborating testimony must be strong and convincing. It is also true, however, that when the testimony of an accomplice is corroborated by unimpeachable testimony and by strong circumstances, it may be given its due weight and force against the person in regard to whom it is presented.<br\/><br\/>The trial court in the opinion upon which its judgment of conviction is founded went into the fact in detail. He analyzed the testimony carefully and gave his reasons for believing the story told by the witnesses for the prosecution rather than that told by the witnesses for the defendants. He saw the witnesses in the act of testifying. He observed carefully their manner upon the witness stand. He studied every detail for the express purpose of determining where credibility lay. We do not feel like interfering with the intelligent conclusion of a court concerning the credibility of witnesses unless the record discloses that some fact or circumstance of weight and influence was overlooked by the court or has been misapprehended or misinterpreted. A careful examination of the record discloses to us no fact, no circumstance, upon which we may base ourselves in saying that the trial court had no right to arrive at the conclusion which he reached. His mind, upon all the evidence was free from a reasonable doubt.\u00a0\u00a0 So is ours.<br\/><br\/>The court properly took into consideration the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity and<i> morada<\/i>. The court properly qualified the crime by<i> alevosia. <\/i><br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

AGAPITO LASADA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nD E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>HILADO, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On December 9, 1908, the provincial fiscal\u00a0 of the Province of Leyte filed a complaint against Agapito Lasada, Santiago Lasada, Macario Lasada, and Panfilio Closa, charging them with the crime of\u00a0 murder. The\u00a0 case was called for hearing on the 26th of January, 1909.\u00a0\u00a0 The accused Agapito Lasada, upon his own\u00a0 application, was granted a\u00a0 separate trial, which commenced on\u00a0 that day.\u00a0\u00a0 On being arraigned\u00a0 on this charge he plead not guilty.\u00a0 After hearing and\u00a0 considering the proofs and arguments presented the trial court found this accused, Agapito\u00a0 Lasada,\u00a0 guilty of the crime of\u00a0 homicide\u00a0 and\u00a0 sentenced him to seventeen years\u00a0 four months and one day of <i>reclusion temporal,<\/i> to the accessory penalties, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased, and to pay one-fourth of the costs.\u00a0 He appealed to this\u00a0 court,\u00a0 and his case is the only one before\u00a0 us at this time. Pedro Sopriengco, a Chinaman and resident of the barrio of Tarragona, municipality\u00a0 of Abuyog, Province of Leyte, left his\u00a0 house about 8 a. m.\u00a0 on March 30,\u00a0 1908, to\u00a0 visit his coconut grove or rice fields, with the intention of returning early that same afternoon.\u00a0 His body was found the next\u00a0 day, March\u00a0 31,\u00a0 about 100 brazus\u00a0 from the\u00a0 bridge which crosses the River Balacoue,\u00a0 within the jurisdiction of his barrio.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the appellant insists: First, that the prosecution failed to establish the guilt of his client of the crime charged;\u00a0 and, second, that it has\u00a0 not been shown\u00a0 that the wounds inflicted upon the body of the Chinaman were the direct cause of his death.\u00a0\u00a0 We will determine the second proposition first:<br\/><br\/>That the\u00a0 Chinaman's body was found on March 31 at a certain place near the river is not questioned, neither is it questioned that when he left home the day before he\u00a0 was enjoying reasonably good health.\u00a0 By\u00a0 order of the justice of the peace Ramon Mandia,\u00a0 a<i> mediquillo,<\/i> examined\u00a0 this body on the day it was found, and according to this witness's testimony, which is not contradicted,\u00a0 the body presented the following described wounds and contusions:\u00a0 A contusion on the forehead, apparently made\u00a0 by a blow; a wound in the right\u00a0 side\u00a0 caused\u00a0 by a sharp\u00a0 cutting instrument. This wound was\u00a0 5 centimeters deep and 4 centimeters long. On\u00a0 the neck\u00a0 and face there were\u00a0 livid marks.\u00a0\u00a0 In\u00a0 the opinion of this witness the\u00a0 wound\u00a0 in\u00a0 the side would\u00a0 not, necessarily, have caused the death of the Chinaman,\u00a0 but the blow on the forehead would have caused his death.<br\/><br\/>Julia\u00a0 Sopriengco,\u00a0 daughter\u00a0 of the deceased, gave\u00a0 about the same description of the wounds on the body as did the mediquillo.\u00a0 The blow on the forehead was evidently caused by some heavy blunt instrument, and we are fully satisfied that this\u00a0 blow,\u00a0 together with the other wounds,\u00a0 was the direct cause of the death of this Chinaman.<br\/><br\/>Agapito Lasada and Santiago Lasada\u00a0 were charged in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Ley te with the crime of <i>lesiones graves.<\/i>\u00a0 It was alleged in this complaint\u00a0 that\u00a0 these\u00a0 two\u00a0 men did on the 23d\u00a0 of February, 1906, criminally and maliciously maltreat Pedro Sopriengco, inflicting\u00a0\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the person\u00a0 of the said\u00a0 Sopriengco three contusions.\u00a0 The Court of First Instance found\u00a0 Agapito Lasada guilty of the crime as charged in the complaint and sentenced him to be confined for the period of four months and\u00a0 to\u00a0 indemnify the\u00a0 injured party in\u00a0 the sum\u00a0 of P50. Lasada appealed to the Supreme Court and this court affirmed the verdict of\u00a0 guilty\u00a0 but reduced the penalty\u00a0 to twenty-five\u00a0 days'\u00a0 imprisonment\u00a0 in the municipal jail\u00a0 of Abuyog, and fixed the amount of the indemnity the same as the trial court.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 certificate, returning the record in this case to the Court of First Instance for the execution of the sentence,\u00a0 was signed by the clerk on the 31st\u00a0 of January, 1908,\u00a0 and\u00a0 it\u00a0 must have\u00a0 arrived in\u00a0 the capital of the Province\u00a0 of Leyte\u00a0 some\u00a0 eight or ten\u00a0 days later, and it required a few days more in sending the order from the capital to Abuyog to the\u00a0 municipal\u00a0 president, directing him to carry the sentence of this Supreme Court into effect.\u00a0\u00a0 Agapito Lasada was, in a way, serving this sentence on the 30th of March\u00a0 of that year; in fact he was\u00a0 then spending his time in the municipality of Abuyog,\u00a0 but was not confined in the municipal jail.\u00a0 He was\u00a0 permitted by the president,\u00a0 Vicente\u00a0 Tiauzon, to go where he pleased\u00a0 in the town and stayed, at least a parigpf\u00a0 the time, in the house of Tiauzon. On account of Tiauzon failing to confine the accused in accordance\u00a0 with the decision of this court, the deceased Chinaman desired to go to the capital of the province in order to notify the provincial authorities of the noncompliance with the order directing the confinement of Lasada by Tiauzon.<br\/><br\/>The two principal witnesses for the prosecution were Espiridion Moldes and Benito Resardo, who testified substantially as follows: That about 5 o'clock on the afternoon of the\u00a0 30th of March,\u00a0 1908,\u00a0 as they\u00a0 were returning to the barrio of Tarragona, and while they were washing their feet in\u00a0 the\u00a0 creek of Tafiguigui, the Chinaman,\u00a0 Pedro Sopriengco, came along;\u00a0 that they asked him to wait and all three of them\u00a0 would go together,\u00a0 but\u00a0 the\u00a0 Chinaman did not wait,\u00a0 saying that\u00a0 he had to\u00a0 make some collections and went on, leaving the other two there.\u00a0 A little later, Moldes\u00a0 and Resardo\u00a0 continued their\u00a0 march, looking for the\u00a0 main\u00a0 road.\u00a0 After\u00a0 they\u00a0 had\u00a0 crossed\u00a0 the\u00a0 Balocaue River\u2014it then\u00a0 beginning to\u00a0 get a little dark\u2014they heard screams, saying: \"Do not kill me.\"\u00a0\u00a0 That on hearing these screams\u00a0 they walked a\u00a0 little faster, turning away from the\u00a0 main road and\u00a0 hiding in the\u00a0 shrubbery; that from the place of their hiding they saw, at a distance of about 4 brazas, Agapito Lasada, Santiago Lasada, Macario Lasada, and Panfilio Closa, the three first named armed with sticks and the\u00a0 last with\u00a0 a\u00a0 dagger, beating\u00a0 Pedro Sopriengco; that the Chinaman was\u00a0 then on the ground and this accused, Agapito\u00a0 Lasada, was holding him by\u00a0 the hair; that they then heard the accused Agapito Lasada say,\u00a0 speaking to the Chinaman: \"You are efficient in making complaints, now you\u00a0 will not do it again.\"<br\/><br\/>Lorenzo Gonzaga, another witness for the prosecution, testified that about 4 p. m. on that day he saw the accused, Agapito\u00a0 Lasada, carrying a\u00a0 club and dressed in\u00a0 canamo clothes, arrive hurriedly at the River Vito, outside the town of\u00a0 Abuyog, and that\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 crossed\u00a0 this\u00a0 river\u00a0 in his\u00a0 (the witness's) <i>banca; <\/i> that after\u00a0 crossing\u00a0 the river the accused continued his march in\u00a0 the direction of Tarragona, but he did not travel in the usually traveled road.<br\/><br\/>Lope Margate testified that on returning from the town of Abuyog to the barrio of Tarragona he saw this accused about 8 p. m. on\u00a0 March\u00a0 30;\u00a0 that\u00a0 the accused was then dressed in ca\u00f1amo clothes and carried a club or stick; that at that time the accused was accompanied by three men, two of whom\u00a0 he knew,\u00a0 being Santiago Lasada and\u00a0 Panfilio Closa; that these four men, including the accused, entered the house\u00a0 of Santiago Lasada in that barrio.<br\/><br\/>Ramon Mandia, another witness for the prosecution, testified that he saw\u00a0 the defendant,\u00a0 Agapito Lasada, on the morning of March\u00a0 31 a little after 8 o'clock, some\u00a0 distance from the <i>tribunal<\/i>\u00a0 in that part of the town called Vitug, the municipal\u00a0 building being on\u00a0 the other side of town, or in that part called Nalibunan; that when he\u00a0 saw the accused on this morning he was dressed in ca\u00f1amo clothes.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 defense sought to establish an alibi, and\u00a0 for\u00a0 this purpose presented\u00a0 Vicente Tiauzon,\u00a0 his son Jose Tiauzon, Ramon\u00a0 Gonzaga, Espiridion Vera,\u00a0 and Doctor Stallman.<br\/><br\/>Vicente\u00a0 Tiauzon\u00a0 was at that time municipal president of the town of Abuyog.\u00a0 He testified that the defendant was in his house in the town on\u00a0 March 30; that he never left the town during that day, nor that night; that\u00a0 he was there serving a sentence, but was not in the municipal jail on account of his sickness; and that he slept in his (witness's)\u00a0 house on the night of March 30.<br\/><br\/>The second witness, Jose Tiauzon,\u00a0 testified that the defendant was in his\u00a0 (witness's) father's house and that they dined together there\u00a0 about 8 p. m. on March 30;\u00a0 that he remembers this because they had\u00a0 quite a conversation on that night.<br\/><br\/>Ramon\u00a0 Gonzaga\u00a0 testified that he saw the defendant on March 30 in the<i> tribunal<\/i> and that when he was taking a walk\u00a0 he saw him\u00a0\u00a0 (the\u00a0 defendant) in the\u00a0 window of the house of the president\u00a0 about ten\u00a0 minutes after 6 in\u00a0 the evening.<br\/><br\/>Espiridion Vera stated that he went to the house of the municipal\u00a0 president one night during the latter part of the month\u00a0 of\u00a0 March,\u00a0\u00a0 but he\u00a0 could not remember the\u00a0 day. Counsel for the defendant withdrew\u00a0 the testimony of this witness.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Stallman, a surgeon\u00a0 in the\u00a0 regular\u00a0 United States Army, testified that he saw the defendant on the 14th of March and various other times from that time until April 4; that the defendant had beriberi; that when he saw the defendant on the 4th of April he was in a worse condition with this disease than he was on the 14th of March, and on\u00a0 being asked whether or not the defendant could make a journey on foot which would require two or three hours' walking, he replied that the defendant could walk for three hours by stopping\u00a0 at\u00a0 intervals,\u00a0 but to do so it would\u00a0 be very difficult; that it would take a person in the condition of the defendant nearly four hours\u00a0 to walk from the town of Abuyog to the\u00a0 barrio of Tarragona.\u00a0 This witness further testified\u00a0 that he saw\u00a0 the defendant walking around\u00a0 the town before and after the 4th of April; that he\u00a0 did\u00a0 not treat this defendant\u00a0 for\u00a0 this disease,\u00a0 but\u00a0\u00a0 his attention was called to it when he went to the house of the president, and that he examined the defendant twice, first on\u00a0 the 14th of March\u00a0 and the second time on the 4th of April.<br\/><br\/>If\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony of the witnesses for the defense\u00a0 be accepted as true, the judgment must be reversed and\u00a0 the defendant acquitted, but if the prosecution's witnesses have truthfully\u00a0 stated the\u00a0 facts,\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant is guilty.\u00a0 To determine this\u00a0 question an analysis of the proofs is necessary.\u00a0 The law presumes\u00a0 that a defendant is\u00a0 not guilty of any\u00a0 crime,\u00a0 and this presumption stands until it\u00a0 is\u00a0 overturned by competent and credible proof.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is incumbent upon the prosecution to establish\u00a0 the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, and if there remains a reasonable doubt as\u00a0 to his guilt or innocence\u00a0 this\u00a0 doubt must be resolved in his favor and he must be acquitted.\u00a0 By reasonable doubt is not meant that which of possibility may arise, but it is that doubt engendered by an\u00a0 investigation of the whole proof and an inability, after such investigation, to let the mind rest easy upon the certainty of guilt.\u00a0 Absolute certainty of guilt is not demanded by the law to convict of any criminal charge but moral certainty is required, and this certainty is required as to every proposition\u00a0 of proof requisite to constitute the offense.\u00a0 There are several modes of\u00a0 impeaching1\u00a0 a witness.\u00a0\u00a0 One mode is by close\u00a0 cross-examination to involve the\u00a0 witness in contradictions and discrepancies\u00a0 as to material facts stated by him.\u00a0\u00a0 Immaterial\u00a0 discrepancies\u00a0 or\u00a0 differences\u00a0 in the\u00a0 statements\u00a0 of witnesses do\u00a0 not affect their credibility, unless there is something to show that they originate in willful falsehood. If there are conflicts in the statements of different witnesses, it is the duty of the court to\u00a0 reconcile them, if it can be done, for the\u00a0 law presumes that every witness has sworn the truth.\u00a0 But\u00a0 if the\u00a0 conflicts in\u00a0 the testimony can not\u00a0 be so\u00a0 reconciled as to\u00a0 admit of\u00a0 every\u00a0 witness swearing the\u00a0 truth, the court must adopt that testimony which it believes to be true; and in reaching this conclusion it can take\u00a0 into\u00a0 consideration the general\u00a0 character\u00a0 of the witness, his manner and demeanor on the stand while testifying, the consistency or inconsistency\u00a0 of his\u00a0 statements, their probability or\u00a0 improbability, his\u00a0 ability and willingness to speak\u00a0 the truth,\u00a0 his intelligence and means of knowledge,\u00a0 his motive\u00a0 to speak the truth or swear\u00a0 a falsehood.<br\/><br\/>In reaching a conclusion in the case under consideration we\u00a0 are deprived of the advantage of seeing the witnesses, hearing\u00a0 them testify, and noting their demeanor on the stand, which\u00a0 are of\u00a0 great assistance in reaching\u00a0 a conclusion when the testimony is so conflicting.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendant in his printed\u00a0 brief points out what he considers a number of contradictions in the testimony presented by the prosecution, and\u00a0 also he gives what\u00a0 he\u00a0 thinks\u00a0 a number of good reasons why this testimony can not be believed.<br\/><br\/>Benito Resardo and\u00a0 Espiridion\u00a0 Moldes make different statements as to whether or not\u00a0 there were houses near the place\u00a0 where they saw the defendant\u00a0 and his companions maltreating the Chinaman, and also as to whether or not they separated after\u00a0 leaving that place or continued their journey together.\u00a0 These are immaterial differences.\u00a0 The attention of these\u00a0 witnesses was not specially\u00a0 directed to the\u00a0 question whether or not there\u00a0 were houses\u00a0 close by, and it\u00a0 is of no importance so far\u00a0 as the truthfulness of their testimony\u00a0 is concerned\u00a0 whether there were\u00a0 houses close by or whether they continued their journey\u00a0 together. Their attention was directed to what they\u00a0 saw and\u00a0 they were not thinking about these minor matters.\u00a0\u00a0 It must be remembered that this\u00a0 trial took place some\u00a0 ten months after the occurrence and\u00a0 these witnesses were no doubt honestly mistaken\u00a0 as to some\u00a0 of the minor details,\u00a0 such as\u00a0 to where they\u00a0 were on the following\u00a0 day when\u00a0 the authorities came to investigate the matter and with whom they talked on that day.<br\/><br\/>Resardo said that he had only testified in this case once. A document was presented to\u00a0 him\u00a0 and he was\u00a0 asked if it was\u00a0 signed by\u00a0 himself.\u00a0\u00a0 He said\u00a0 it was.\u00a0 The witness said he was only asked questions in the justice of the peace court.\u00a0 The preliminary investigation, if\u00a0 any were held, is not made a part of this\u00a0 record.\u00a0 The witness said\u00a0 that he\u00a0 did not testify\u00a0 before\u00a0 the\u00a0 justice of the peace, but explains this by saying that the justice of the peace\u00a0 only asked\u00a0 him questions.\u00a0\u00a0 This appears to be a satisfactory explanation on that point.\u00a0 The same witness stated that he was not related to Julia Sopriengco, the daughter\u00a0 of the deceased Chinaman; but, as the court below said, he later explained this mistake.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of Geronimo Barbasan and Justino Mundala, wherein they stated that they, together with Moldes and\u00a0 Resardo, were invited to the house of Julia Sopriengco and\u00a0 while they were all there the said Julia offered them ^200 each\u00a0 on condition that they would testify that the defendant and\u00a0 his brothers killed her\u00a0 father, is so unreasonable that it can not be believed.\u00a0 This testimony was flatly denied by Moldes, Resardo, and Julia; in fact Julia and her sister Felisa testified that they were not at home at any\u00a0 time from the 1st of\u00a0 April to\u00a0 the 7th of April.\u00a0 It is not reasonable that Julia would have called\u00a0 these four men together and made this offer in the presence of all of them, knowing the enmity which existed between Barbasan and Mundala on one side\u00a0 and Moldes on the other.<br\/><br\/>Vicente Tiauzon, the principal\u00a0 witness for the defense, was evidently deeply interested in this case.\u00a0\u00a0 He had been directed to\u00a0 confine the\u00a0 defendant in\u00a0 accordance\u00a0 with\u00a0 a decision of this court.\u00a0 He failed to do so and was keeping the defendant at\u00a0 his\u00a0 own house.\u00a0 According to Julia Sopriengco, her father had complained to the president about not confining the defendant, so\u00a0 it was to his interest to testify\u00a0 in favor\u00a0 of the\u00a0 defendant.\u00a0 The same influence was no\u00a0 doubt brought to bear upon his son, Jose\u00a0 Tiauzon.<br\/><br\/>The other witness, Gonzaga, as we have said, testified that he saw the defendant in\u00a0 the house of the president about ten minutes after 6 on\u00a0 the evening of March 30.\u00a0 This testimony was given some ten months afterwards.<br\/><br\/>Doctor Stallmen's testimony is the strongest in\u00a0 support of the alibi, but he\u00a0 testified that\u00a0 the defendant could have made the trip on foot from the town of Abuyog to the barrio of Tarragona, which would have taken\u00a0 about three hours. He also testified that he saw the defendant walking around the town during\u00a0 those days.\u00a0 The defendant could\u00a0 and, in fact, did walk around in the town during that time and never was in a condition\u00a0 so that he could not travel.\u00a0 According to the doctor, as we have said, it would have taken the defendant about three hours to walk to this\u00a0 barrio, but it must be remembered that the <i>cocales<\/i>\u00a0 or\u00a0 rice fields where the\u00a0 deceased went\u00a0 that day are between the barrio and the\u00a0 town, and it took\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased,\u00a0 walking\u00a0 fast, a little less than an hour\u00a0 to walk from his home toward the town to these <i> cocales.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 Chinaman\u00a0 was killed near the river\u00a0 on\u00a0 that day. Two witnesses saw the defendant and his companions commit this murder.\u00a0\u00a0 The testimony of these two witnesses is corroborated by the witnesses Gonzaga and\u00a0 Margate. It is also corroborated to a certain extent by Mandia.\u00a0 The testimony of all\u00a0 these\u00a0 witnesses\u00a0 is\u00a0 reasonable.\u00a0 The motive on the part of the defendant for killing the deceased\u00a0 is clearly shown.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of the witnesses for the defense, who sought to establish an alibi, can not overcome the positive\u00a0 and direct testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, especially when we consider the fact that the main witness for the defense, Vicente Tiauzon, was deeply interested in favor of the defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 Doctor Stallman's testimony can be accepted as true and then the alibi would not,\u00a0 by any means, be established, as he stated that the defendant could have made\u00a0 that\u00a0 trip,\u00a0 and it has been clearly\u00a0 established that the defendant was walking around\u00a0 the\u00a0 town during these days.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge had an opportunity to see these witnesses, hear them testify, and\u00a0 observe their demeanor on\u00a0 the witness stand.\u00a0\u00a0 This is one of the best ways of determining the credibility of a\u00a0 witness.\u00a0\u00a0 After hearing all these witnesses testify he was convinced beyond a reasonable\u00a0 doubt that the witnesses for\u00a0 the prosecution testified the truth. In view\u00a0 of\u00a0 these facts\u00a0 we must give great\u00a0 weight to\u00a0 the findings made by the trial court.\u00a0 We only have the record, and, as we\u00a0 have said,\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony for the prosecution is reasonable.\u00a0 It is direct and positive.\u00a0 In view of\u00a0 the clear\u00a0 and explicit findings\u00a0 made by the trial court, and after\u00a0 a careful consideration of the testimony presented, we are fully satisfied that the defendant is guilty of this crime.<br\/><br\/>On the 5th of\u00a0 April, 1909, counsel for the defendant presented in this court\u00a0 a motion for the reopening of this case for the purpose of presenting newly discovered evidence.\u00a0 This motion\u00a0 is\u00a0 sworn to and accompanied by two affidavits.\u00a0 The first is that\u00a0 of Apolonio Monton,\u00a0 and\u00a0 according to this\u00a0 affidavit Monton had a\u00a0 conversation with Panfilio Closa in the carcel on\u00a0 the 2d day of March,\u00a0 1909, and that during this conversation the said Closa told this witness that he,\u00a0 Closa, and a\u00a0 brother-in-law of his\u00a0 were the men who killed the\u00a0 Chinaman, and that this defendant and his brothers had nothing to do with this\u00a0 murder.\u00a0\u00a0 The other affidavit was made by Agapito Suganob, and according to this affidavit Suganob heard this\u00a0 conversation between Closa and Monton, and heard Closa say to Monton that he, Closa, and his brother-in-law were the authors of this crime.<br\/><br\/>Panfilio\u00a0 Closa was\u00a0 charged, along with this\u00a0 defendant and the other accused, in the same complaint, with having killed\u00a0 the Chinaman.\u00a0 He escaped\u00a0 from jail a\u00a0 very short time after this alleged confession.\u00a0 These parties said nothing\u00a0 about this confession\u00a0 until after\u00a0 Closa\u00a0 had\u00a0 made good his escape.\u00a0\u00a0 He was confined\u00a0 in the\u00a0 jail at Tacloban when this trial took place and he could have been presented without any difficulty as a witness in favor of this defendant, and if\u00a0 his confession\u00a0 were true\u00a0 this could\u00a0 have been\u00a0 ascertained at the time\u00a0 this trial took place.\u00a0 No reason is given why Closa made this confession.\u00a0 The statements of these two men in these affidavits are so improbable and so unreasonable that they can not\u00a0 be\u00a0 believed, especially in view of the fact that they said nothing about this matter until Closa made his escape.\u00a0\u00a0 For these reasons this motion is denied.<br\/><br\/>Three other\u00a0 affidavits were filed\u00a0 on February 10,\u00a0 1910, but they were not\u00a0 accompanied by any motion.asking for a reopening of the\u00a0 case, or giving any reasons\u00a0 why\u00a0 these witnesses were\u00a0 not presented4 during the\u00a0 trial.\u00a0\u00a0 So\u00a0 these affidavits can not be considered.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is, therefore,\u00a0 affirmed, with costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Stallman, a\u00a0 regular physician and surgeon of the United States\u00a0 Army, who gave\u00a0 it as his opinion that, by\u00a0 reason of the unsanitary\u00a0 and\u00a0 uninhabitable condition of said jail, it would probably result injuriously if\u00a0 not fatally\u00a0 to\u00a0 the accused if he should be confined therein;\u00a0 that he strongly advised against such incarceration; that, by reason of such recommendation, the president of the village of Abuyog permitted the accused\u00a0 to remain at his\u00a0 home under\u00a0 his personal care and\u00a0 vigilance, feeling that he would not be warranted in exposing the\u00a0 life\u00a0 of the prisoner\u00a0 to such imminent danger;\u00a0 that it was while the accused\u00a0 was thus serving his sentence in the\u00a0 president's house that the said crime was committed.<br\/><br\/>The said village president, his son, and a neighbor were the\u00a0 witnesses before mentioned who testified that at the exact hour of the\u00a0 commission of\u00a0 the crime at Tarragona, and for hours before and for hours after, the accused was at the house of the said village president in Abuyog, some 6 or 8 miles from\u00a0 the scene of the\u00a0 crime, so ill of beriberi that it was practically impossible\u00a0 for him to have\u00a0 made the journey necessary for the commission of the offense.<br\/><br\/>With these directly opposing declarations before him, the trial court found himself\u00a0 under the necessity of determining who of the witnesses were telling the truth.\u00a0 It was while thus engaged that\u00a0 he made, in my judgment, the error of\u00a0 which I\u00a0 complain.\u00a0\u00a0 Under such circumstances\u00a0 it was the manifest\u00a0 duty of the trial\u00a0 court to take into consideration not only the personal interests and predilections of the\u00a0 various witnesses, but\u00a0 also the\u00a0 circumstances\u00a0 in which the whole case was found embedded and\u00a0 in\u00a0 which it was completely\u00a0 enveloped.\u00a0 He\u00a0 was required not only to regard the <i>witnesses<\/i> from the standpoint of their personal interest\u00a0 and relationships, but also the\u00a0 <i>reasonableness of the\u00a0 whole case<\/i> as\u00a0 made by\u00a0 the prosecution under all the evidence.\u00a0 I am constrained to believe\u00a0 that\u00a0 the learned trial court did not dx&gt; this.\u00a0 While he considered to\u00a0 some extent the personal predilections of\u00a0 the witnesses and\u00a0 their consequent bias, he disregarded almost completely the important and weighty circumstances which gave color and consistency\u00a0 to the\u00a0 case as a whole.\u00a0 Inasmuch as the Supreme Court has followed\u00a0 precisely the course and method adopted\u00a0 by the trial court, my suggestions\u00a0 in this connection apply to both judgments.\u00a0\u00a0 I proceed\u00a0 to detail the reasons for\u00a0 my position.<br\/><br\/>Concerning the\u00a0 testimony of Vicente Tiauzon, the said president, the trial\u00a0 court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The president of Abuyog, Vicente Tiauzon, another witness for the\u00a0 defense who sought to support with his\u00a0 oath the alibi of Agapito Lasada,\u00a0 in the opinion of the court, is not entitled to any credit whatever.\u00a0 This witness has a decided interest in\u00a0 favoring\u00a0 the alibi in order to hide the grave dereliction of duty of which he would be responsible otherwise, for, as\u00a0 will be seen presently,\u00a0 Agapito Lasada, at the time of the commission of the crime, was a prisoner sentenced by the Supreme Court, who ought to have served his\u00a0 sentence in\u00a0 the\u00a0 municipal jail of Abuyog, but\u00a0 who, instead, was serving it in the home of his witness, Tiauzon. It is not necessary to do more than note\u00a0 the answers of the latter to the questions of the fiscal on cross-examination to see instantly the improbability of his testimony and at the\u00a0 same time\u00a0 the\u00a0 partiality\u00a0 of the witness.\u00a0\u00a0 The same may be said of the other witness of the defense, Jose Tiauzon, son of\u00a0 the president, and his evidence.\u00a0 The testimony of the other witnesses to the alibi is hardly worth mentioning by reason of its inconsistency and improbability.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>This statement requires notice on account of the reasons which the trial court therein gives, as before mentioned, for rejecting absolutely and entirely the testimony of the defense\u00a0 and\u00a0 refusing\u00a0 to\u00a0 give it\u00a0 any weight\u00a0 or\u00a0 influence whatever.\u00a0\u00a0 The reasons given\u00a0 for the rejection of the testimony of the village president, as is readily seen, are two: (1)\u00a0 The\u00a0 interest which\u00a0 the witness\u00a0 had\u00a0 in covering up the fact that he removed the\u00a0 accused from the\u00a0 municipal jail to his house.\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 A reading of the cross-examination of the witness shows at\u00a0 once the improbability of his testimony and\u00a0 the partiality of the witness.<br\/><br\/>The first\u00a0 reason, the interest of the witness in covering up the removal\u00a0 of the prisoner, is\u00a0 rendered doubly important and interesting in view\u00a0 of the fact that the Supreme Court has adopted that as the sole reason for disregarding as utterly worthless the testimony of this witness, as well as that of his son.\u00a0 This\u00a0 court says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Vicente Tiauzon, the\u00a0 principal witness for the defense, was\u00a0 evidently deeply interested in this case.\u00a0 He had been directed to confine the defendant in accordance with a decision\u00a0 of this court.\u00a0 He failed\u00a0 to do so and\u00a0 was keeping the .defendant at his own house.\u00a0 According to Julia Sopriengco, her father had\u00a0 complained to the president about not confining the defendant, so it was to\u00a0 his interest to testify in favor of the defendant.\u00a0 The same influence was no doubt brought to bear upon his son\/ Jose Tiauzon.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In my humble judgment, the reason thus given for rejecting: this testimony has no sure foundation and\u00a0 is\u00a0 given under\u00a0 an entire misconception\u00a0 of the transaction.\u00a0 It is undisputed in this case, as I have before stated,\u00a0 that the accused was, at the time of his\u00a0 sentence to confinement in the municipal jail, ill of\u00a0 beriberi; that a physician and surgeon of the United States Army,.after a personal examination of the\u00a0 accused and an inspection of the jail\u00a0 in which\u00a0 he\u00a0 was to be confined, gave it as his opinion that, owing\u00a0 to the grave nature of the illness of the accused and the condition hygienically\u00a0 in\u00a0 which he\u00a0 found the\u00a0 jail, together with the fact that, by reason of its dilapidation and the fact that the rainy season was on,\u00a0 it was\u00a0 practically uninhabitable by a human\u00a0 being, the safety of the accused required that he be not incarcerated therein; that it was owing\u00a0 to this advice and in accordance therewith\u00a0 that the witness Tiauzon took the accused from the jail and sheltered him\u00a0 in his\u00a0 house\u00a0 under his own\u00a0 personal custody and vigilance.<br\/><br\/>While, from a strictly legal point of view, there might possibly be some question as to the propriety of the act of president in removing the\u00a0 accused from\u00a0 the jail\u00a0 to house, something which I doubt very much and do not here discuss, there is,\u00a0 from\u00a0 the other point of view, still the question\u00a0 whether the municipality, or its officials personally, would not have been responsible to the\u00a0 accused if his confinement in the jail under the circumstances and conditions described had resulted in serious damage to him, It is, therefore, a matter of serious doubt whether there was anything in this act of the president which needed to be covered\u00a0 up.\u00a0\u00a0 It may\u00a0 fairly be assumed,\u00a0 under all the circumstances, that he acted with the knowledge and consent of the municipal council\u00a0 and that his act tended to relieve the municipality from the.possibility, if not probability,\u00a0 of being asked to respond in damages for injuries resulting from the confinement of the accused in a building which had been condemned\u00a0 by a competent physician as wholly\u00a0 unfit to be occupied, especially during\u00a0 the rainy season,\u00a0 by a person suffering from beriberi.\u00a0 One's sense of justice\u00a0 cries out against incarcerating the accused in such a\u00a0 place at such a time, suffering as he\u00a0 was from a terrible and,\u00a0 in\u00a0 many cases, fatal disease;\u00a0 and the\u00a0 law would\u00a0 need to be very\u00a0 explicit indeed if he were to be punished for an act so humane, so in accord with civilized sentiment,\u00a0 especially\u00a0 when it appears\u00a0 to have been done with the knowledge and approval of the municipal council.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons I\u00a0 have great difficulty in appreciating the reasons upon which\u00a0 the court bases its assertion that the act\u00a0 of\u00a0 the president\u00a0 in removing the\u00a0 accused from, the municipal\u00a0 jail was\u00a0 of. such a\u00a0 heinous character that it needed\u00a0 to be covered up\u00a0 and hidden, even at\u00a0 the expense of perjury.\u00a0 As\u00a0 a natural consequence I\u00a0 meet the same difficulty in trying to\u00a0 fathom the reasons\u00a0 of the court in utterly\u00a0 rejecting\u00a0 upon this ground alone\u00a0 the testimony of the president and his family.<br\/><br\/>It must not be forgotten that the jail, according to the undisputed evidence, was in such a condition\u00a0 of dilapidation that a prisoner confined therein, who was able to walk from 12 to 16 miles and lend effective assistance in\u00a0 killing an able-bodied man, as the accused is charged to have done, would have been able to escape therefrom easily.\u00a0 Moreover, if the testimony of Doctor\u00a0 Stallman concerning the physical condition of the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 is true, and it is neither disputed nor\u00a0 challenged\u00a0 by anybody,\u00a0 he\u00a0 was,\u00a0 in\u00a0 effect, chained to\u00a0 his place in the village of Abuyog substantially as effectively\u00a0 as\u00a0 if he had\u00a0 been manacled and shackled. His chances of escape, under all the conditions, were\u00a0 so\u00a0 few as to be practically\u00a0 negligible\u2014at least,\u00a0 they\u00a0 would have been in\u00a0 nowise decreased by confinement in the jail.<br\/><br\/>I do not\u00a0 discuss the other reason given by the trial court for rejecting the\u00a0 testimony of this witness, namely, that a reading of\u00a0 his cross-examination would show instantly the improbability\u00a0 of\u00a0 the evidence\u00a0 and the partiality\u00a0 of\u00a0 the witness. Such discussion is unnecessary on account of the fact that the\u00a0 Supreme Court has itself rejected that reason and has\u00a0 placed\u00a0 itself\u00a0 expressly and solely on\u00a0 the one first\u00a0 mentioned.\u00a0 It needs only to\u00a0 be said\u00a0 that, after a careful reading of the testimony of the witness, including the cross-examination, I, and\u00a0 I think the rest of the court also, arrived at the conclusion\u00a0 that, upon its face (and it is in that respect and in that respect only that the trial court finds fault with it) it bears every appearance of\u00a0 good faith, is thoroughly consistent, entirely probable, and\u00a0 discloses a complete absence of partiality.\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, it is a model of fair, impartial,\u00a0 and consistent testimony on cross-examination.<br\/><br\/>It must be borne in\u00a0 mind\u00a0 that the trial court did\u00a0 not place\u00a0 his\u00a0 rejection of\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony of\u00a0 the defendant's witnesses in any way\u00a0 or to any extent <i>on their appearance on\u00a0 the witness stand or their\u00a0 manner and demeanor\u00a0 while testifying.<\/i>\u00a0 He placed it solely on the two grounds named: (<i>a<\/i>) The\u00a0 interest which Tiauzon had in\u00a0 covering\u00a0 up\u00a0 the fact that\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 was at\u00a0 his house\u00a0 instead\u00a0 of\u00a0 in jail, and (<i>b<\/i>) his evidence\u00a0 as it appears in the cross-examination.\u00a0 Therefore, that\u00a0 portion of the majority opinion which says \"and in\u00a0 reaching this conclusion it\u00a0 [the trial court] can take\u00a0 into\u00a0 consideration the general character of\u00a0 the witness, his manner\u00a0 and\u00a0 demeanor\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 stand while testifying,\" as well as\u00a0 that part wherein the. court declares that \"in reaching a conclusion\u00a0 in the case\u00a0 under\u00a0 consideration we are deprived\u00a0 of the advantage\u00a0 of seeing the witnesses,\u00a0 hearing them\u00a0 testify,\u00a0 and noting their\u00a0 demeanor on\u00a0 the stand, which are of great assistance in reaching a conclusion\u00a0 when\u00a0 the\u00a0 testimony is\u00a0 so conflicting\/'\u00a0 is apparently inapplicable.\u00a0 The trial court gave specifically the reasons why he rejected the testimony of defendant's witnesses.\u00a0 The reasons stated in\u00a0 the foregoing quotations are not\u00a0 among them.\u00a0 This court in a criminal case\u00a0 ought not to assign such reasons.<br\/><br\/>The following observation of this court is also\u00a0 beside the point and for the same reasons:<br\/><blockquote>\"The trial judge had\u00a0 an opportunity to see these witnesses, hear them testify, and observe their demeanor\u00a0 on the witness stand.\u00a0 This is one of the best ways of determining the credibility of a witness.\u00a0 After hearing all these witnesses\u00a0 testify he was convinced\u00a0 beyond\u00a0 a\u00a0 reasonable doubt that the witnesses\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 prosecution testified the truth.\u00a0 In view of these facts we must give great weight to the findings made by the trial\u00a0 court.\u00a0 We only\u00a0 have the record, and, as we have\u00a0 said, the testimony for the prosecution is\u00a0 reasonable.\u00a0 It is direct and positive.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>We have absolutely no knowledge, <i>from the record,<\/i> that the witnesses\u00a0 for the\u00a0 prosecution appeared to the\u00a0 trial court better,\u00a0 or fairer\u00a0 upon the stand than\u00a0 those\u00a0 of the defense.\u00a0 The\u00a0 trial\u00a0 court\u00a0 having assigned his reasons for rejecting the\u00a0 testimony in favor of the defense,\u00a0 we must assume that he presented them all.\u00a0 I am confident that a careful study of the record leaves the advantage decidedly with the witnesses for the defense.\u00a0 Neither the trial court nor this court has been able to point out in the\u00a0 testimony of a single witness for the defense a place where there was a contradiction, an\u00a0 attempt to create a false impression, or\u00a0 an appearance of unfairness.\u00a0\u00a0 If\u00a0 the witnesses\u00a0 of the defense lied, their testimony carries upon its face no badge of falsity.\u00a0\u00a0 They need no explanations to excuse contradictions, or laborious\u00a0 reasoning to\u00a0 dissipate the\u00a0 effect of flagrant misstatements\u00a0 of admitted facts.\u00a0 On\u00a0 the\u00a0 other hand, some of the leading witnesses for the prosecution made in their\u00a0 declarations admittedly false statements in relation to material facts, thereby misleading and deceiving the court.\u00a0 This is particularly true of the witness Resardo, whose misstatements we shall\u00a0 presently note,\u00a0 and the witness Gonzaga, whose statement that he saw the accused on the day\u00a0 of the crime in the vicinity where it was committed carries\u00a0 certain allegations concerning the appearance and activity of the accused\u00a0 which, as\u00a0 we\u00a0 shall\u00a0 presently see, render such statement unbelievable.<br\/><br\/>The trial court spent a considerable portion\u00a0 of the space allotted\u00a0 to his opinion in excusing the various contradictions in which witnesses for the prosecution involved themselves in giving their testimony.\u00a0 In the testimony of the witness Benito Resardo, one of the witnesses who testified that he actually saw the accused kill the deceased, appear on cross-examination these questions and answers:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. How many times have you already testified in this case? - A.\u00a0 This is the first time.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Do you swear that this is the first time that you have testified? - A. Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Did you not testify before the justice of the peace of Abuyog? - A.\u00a0 No, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Do you swear that you\u00a0 did not testify in the court of the justice of the\u00a0 peace of Abuyog?\u2014A. Yes, sir, I swear.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Do you swear? - A. I swear.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>After these questions and answers were given, it developed that this witness had in reality testified before the justice of the peace of Abuyog in this case.<br\/><br\/>In the testimony of the same witness appear the following questions and answers, the questions being put by the court:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Have\u00a0 you any\u00a0 enmity\u00a0 or\u00a0 resentment\u00a0 against the accused? - A. No, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Have you\u00a0 any friendship\u00a0 or relationship\u00a0 with the family of the deceased? - A. No.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The\u00a0 attorney for the accused\u00a0 then\u00a0 asked' the witness certain questions, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Have you any relationship\u00a0 with Julia Sopriengco? - A. No, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Are you not a cousin of Julia Sopriengco? - A. My father is Filipino; her father is Chinese.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Is\u00a0 it not true that Julia's mother\u00a0 and your father are brother and sister? - A. No,\u00a0 sir.\u00a0 My father\u00a0 is from Samar.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It\u00a0 was later proved in the case and is now an\u00a0 admitted fact\u00a0 that\u00a0 said witness and\u00a0 Julia Sopriengco, daughter of the deceased,\u00a0 are\u00a0 blood cousins.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 trial\u00a0 court, in excusing this witness for\u00a0 his\u00a0 apparent lack of frankness, if not of truth, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The witness\u00a0 for the prosecution, Benito Resardo,\u00a0 has been censured for the\u00a0 relationship which he bears to the daughter of the deceased and for having denied such relationship; but it is certain that being called by the court to testify\u00a0 a second time as a\u00a0 witness, he\u00a0 gave satisfactory explanation by saying that he had denied his relationship with Julia Sopriengco upon the understanding that he had been asked in relation to the masculine line\u00a0 and not the feminine, and for that reason he said that his father\u00a0 was from Samar, that\u00a0 is, a Filipino\u00a0 from the Visayas, while the father of Julia is Chinese.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The\u00a0 two witnesses for the prosecution, Resardo\u00a0 and Moldes, the two who claim to have seen the defendant in the act of killing1\u00a0 the deceased, make different statements as to whether or\u00a0 not\u00a0 there\u00a0 were houses near the place where they saw the\u00a0 defendant engaged in murdering the Chinaman, and\u00a0 also\u00a0 as to whether or not they separated after leaving that place or continued their journey together. They also differ as to where they were when the authorities investigated the crime on the fallowing day.\u00a0 Both the trial court and this court, on\u00a0 appeal,\u00a0 say in\u00a0 relation to these discrepancies:<br\/><blockquote> \"These are immaterial differences.\u00a0\u00a0 The attention of these witnesses was not specially directed to the question whether or not there were houses close by, and it is of no importance so far as the truthfulness of their testimony is concerned whether there were houses close by\u00a0 or whether they continued their journey\u00a0 together.\" <\/blockquote>This is undoubtedly true and I am very far from desiring to present a criticism of testimony based\u00a0 upon trivial differences.\u00a0\u00a0 However, these two witnesses were well acquainted with the\u00a0 locality in\u00a0 which\u00a0 the crime\u00a0 was committed,\u00a0 in fact, they lived in that vicinity, and\u00a0 should have known thoroughly the location of all houses thereabouts. I mention these differences simply for the purpose\u00a0 of emphasizing the fact that the testimony of the witnesses\u00a0 for the defense, from the record presented, did not apparently receive\u00a0 the same\u00a0 consideration\u00a0 accorded to\u00a0 that\u00a0 of\u00a0 the prosecution.\u00a0\u00a0 This court,\u00a0 as\u00a0 well\u00a0 as\u00a0 the\u00a0 trial\u00a0 court, finds itself continually under the necessity of excusing the evasions of the witnesses for\u00a0 the\u00a0 prosecution, and yet,\u00a0 in spite of that, gives\u00a0 those\u00a0 witnesses full\u00a0 faith and\u00a0 credit, while rejecting utterly the testimony of the witnesses for the defense, in whose declarations is found nothing which needs excuse.\u00a0 This court says in\u00a0 its opinion:<br\/><blockquote>\"Resardo said that he had only testified in this case once. A document was presented to him\u00a0 and he was asked if it was signed by himself.\u00a0 He said it was.\u00a0 The witness said he was only asked questions in the justice of the peace court. The\u00a0 preliminary investigation, if any were held,\u00a0 is not made a part of this\u00a0 record.\u00a0 The witness said that\u00a0 he did not testify before the justice\u00a0 of the\u00a0 peace,\u00a0 but\u00a0 explains this by saying that the justice of\u00a0 the peace only asked him questions.\u00a0\u00a0 This appears to be a satisfactory explanation on\u00a0 that point.\u00a0 The\u00a0 same witness stated\u00a0 that he\u00a0 was not related to\u00a0 Julia\u00a0 Sopriengco, the\u00a0 daughter of the\u00a0 deceased Chinaman; but, as the court below said, he later explained this mistake.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>But these are not the only inconsistencies in the testimony of the witnesses of the prosecution\u00a0 which need to be explained or excused.\u00a0 The testimony\u00a0 of\u00a0 <i>Mandia,<\/i> the mediguillo who examined the body of the deceased the day after the tragedy, is entirely at variance with the sworn\u00a0 declaration of the witnesses\u00a0 Moldes and Resardo.\u00a0\u00a0 These two witnesses declare that they saw the accused and others\u00a0 strike the deceased in the\u00a0 head\u00a0 with clubs while he was lying on the ground <i>face downward;<\/i>\u00a0 while Mandia testifies, and this is an\u00a0 admitted fact, that there\u00a0 was evidence\u00a0 of <i>only one\u00a0 blow<\/i> upon\u00a0 the head and <i>that was in the forehead.<\/i> Confronted with this condition, the\u00a0 prosecution, in\u00a0 order to escape so patent\u00a0 an inconsistency, obtained from the witness the statement that\u00a0 it\u00a0 was possible that the wound in the forehead might have been\u00a0 produced from the rear. He\u00a0 said:<br\/><blockquote>\"As I understand the wound it might have been produced when\u00a0 the\u00a0 deceased had his\u00a0 back turned.\u00a0 I have\u00a0 never studied wounds, but as I understand it the wound had the appearance of having been made from the rear.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It should be remembered that the witness is not a doctor and has no special knowledge of wounds.\u00a0\u00a0 His evidence as to the position from which the\u00a0 blow was given is entitled to no more weight than that of the ordinary man.\u00a0 How a person may be struck several times in the head with a club while he is lying on the ground\u00a0 face downward and show evidence of only one blow and that <i>in the forehead<\/i> is difficult to understand.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, it is admitted that the body of the deceased showed only two injuries\u00a0\u00a0 one in the\u00a0 forehead made by a club, as we have said, and one in the\u00a0 right side produced by a dagger.\u00a0 According to the\u00a0 witnesses for the prosecution, the deceased was lying on the ground face downward, apparently dead or mortally injured, when they first saw him.\u00a0 That his face and forehead were, from their statements, in contact with the earth is made doubly\u00a0 certain from\u00a0 the fact, as stated by them, <i>that the\u00a0 accused held the deceased by the cue<\/i> while he hit him. They say he never moved while they were watching.\u00a0 They saw\u00a0 the\u00a0 dagger wound inflicted.\u00a0 It was done while he was\u00a0 lying down. Now,\u00a0 either the deceased lay down on his face before\u00a0 he was injured at all or else he was thus laid low by the blow in the forehead.\u00a0 But if he received the blow in the\u00a0 forehead before he fell\u00a0 then these two witnesses\u00a0 testified mistakenly or falsely when they said <i>that they saw the accused and his companions deal the deceased several blows in the head with their clubs while he was thus lying face downward; <\/i> for, where is the evidence of those blows?\u00a0\u00a0 It is the undisputed fact\u00a0 (see the majority opinion in this case), as we have\u00a0 before stated, that the person of the deceased presented only two wounds\u2014one a club wound in the forehead and the other a dagger wound in the right side.\u00a0\u00a0 Were those blows, so vividly and graphically described by these two witnesses, wholly imaginary? Where on\u00a0 the body of the deceased, that silent piece of clay\u00a0 that can not lie, is the evidence of their delivery?\u00a0 Surely those vicious blows with\u00a0 heavy\u00a0 bludgeons upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 unprotected head\u00a0 of\u00a0 an unresisting man would leave their indelible imprint and tell to all the world the story\u00a0 of their treacherous delivery! If such blows\u00a0 had really been delivered, that body\u00a0 would have\u00a0 presented the\u00a0 record\u00a0 of them as\u00a0 inevitably and\u00a0 ineffaceably\u00a0 as though that record had been\u00a0 carved in rock. If, on the\u00a0 other hand, it be said that he received the blow in the forehead <i>after he fell,<\/i> we\u00a0 naturally inquire,\u00a0 in the first place, why he fell at all\u00a0 and lay so still, being, up to that moment, wholly\u00a0 uninjured;\u00a0 in the second place,\u00a0 we should like to know\u00a0 how he could\u00a0 have\u00a0 been struck\u00a0 in the forehead,\u00a0 lying as\u00a0 he\u00a0 was\u00a0 face\u00a0 downward; and,\u00a0 in the third place, why did his body not disclose evidence of more than\u00a0 one blow ?\u00a0\u00a0 View it as we will, there is something wrong with\u00a0 the testimony\u00a0 of these two witnesses of\u00a0 the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, it is the universal testimony\u00a0 of every witness for the prosecution who claims to have seen the accused on the fatal day that he moved with the ease, celerity,\u00a0 quickness,\u00a0 and\u00a0 rapidity which\u00a0 would\u00a0 naturally characterize a thoroughly sound man engaged\u00a0 in such\u00a0 an\u00a0 enterprise. Each witness testified that the accused showed no signs of illness or difficulty of movement, but walked not only easily and\u00a0 naturally\u00a0 but very rapidly.\u00a0 From the condition\u00a0 in which the\u00a0 accused admittedly was at the\u00a0 time,\u00a0 suffering from\u00a0 a disease which effectually prevented his walking except with\u00a0 extreme difficulty,\u00a0 we\u00a0 know\u00a0 that\u00a0 the story\u00a0 of these witnesses in this respect is untrue.\u00a0 It would have been utterly\u00a0 impossible for\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 to have\u00a0 walked\u00a0 in the manner described.\u00a0\u00a0 <i>That the disease\u00a0 with which he was admittedly afflicted at the\u00a0 time would certainly have prevented this, is the undisputed evidence of the case.<\/i><br\/><br\/>I point out these things not\u00a0 to carp or to be\u00a0 hypercritical, but merely to demonstrate that, while no excuse whatever need be offered for contradictions in the testimony of the witnesses for the defense, their testimony being entirely free therefrom even in minor matters, as much can not be said of the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>But I do not rest my\u00a0 conclusion wholly or even mainly upon the inconsistencies pointed out.\u00a0 I base it\u00a0 rather upon the\u00a0 affirmative\u00a0 evidence of the defense.\u00a0 To demonstrate this there remains to be pointed out that portion of the evidence\u00a0 of the defense which,\u00a0 in my judgment, throws the gravest doubt upon\u00a0 the ability of the accused to kill the Chinaman at the place, at the time, and in\u00a0 the manner alleged.\u00a0\u00a0 As we have before stated, the accused at the time the crime was committed was suffering severely from the disease known as\u00a0 beriberi.\u00a0\u00a0 The distance from the house of the witness Vicente Tiauzon to the place where the Chinaman was found dead; although not shown definitely by the evidence, is probably about\u00a0 8 miles.\u00a0\u00a0 To reach\u00a0 the place from the Tiauzon house one would be compelled to traverse on foot a wild and broken country, crossing two\u00a0 rivers on the way.\u00a0 There is no other contention than\u00a0 that he made the journey on foot. Doctor Stallman, the witness heretofore mentioned, testified that he. saw and\u00a0 personally examined the accused on\u00a0 the\u00a0 14th day of March, sixteen\u00a0 days before the commission of the crime.\u00a0 That he was suffering from beriberi.\u00a0 That he again\u00a0 examined him\u00a0 on the 4th day of April, four days after the commission of the crime, and\u00a0 that the\u00a0 disease had\u00a0 progressed\u00a0 in\u00a0 intensity.\u00a0 That between these two dates he\u00a0 saw him\u00a0 at\u00a0 various times in the village, sometimes walking; <i>that he walked only\u00a0 with extreme difficulty;<\/i> that in\u00a0 the condition in which he was on the 4th of\u00a0 April the defendant \"would be able to walk for three hours, but he would be obliged to stop at intervals to rest.\"\u00a0 Asked whether or not it would\u00a0 be easy to make a journey of that\u00a0 length, the doctor replied\u00a0 <i>\"it\u00a0 would be extremely difficult. <\/i> It would take\u00a0 about four hours\u00a0 for the accused in the state in which I found him\u00a0 on the 4th of April to go from Abuyog to Tarragona.\"<br\/><br\/>In the light\u00a0 of the testimony of Doctor Stallman and the authorities hereafter cited,\u00a0 which demonstrate conclusively the condition in which\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 was at the time the crime\u00a0 was committed, it would\u00a0 have been extremely improbable, if\u00a0 not practically impossible, that the\u00a0 accused travel\u00a0 the distance required within the time allotted and commit the crime charged against him\u00a0 so improbable that I have been wholly unable to bring myself to believe under the evidence\u00a0 that he actually did so.<br\/><br\/>In this connection, I again call\u00a0 attention to the testimony of the\u00a0 witness Lorenzo Gonzaga,\u00a0 as well as\u00a0 the others who testified as to how the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 walked on the fatal\u00a0 day. He swore that on the day in question, at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, he ferried the accused\u00a0 across the Vito River in his banca and that the accused\u00a0 was going in the direction of Tarragona.\u00a0 In his testimony appear the\u00a0 following questions and answers:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q.\u00a0 How was\u00a0 the\u00a0 accused walking, fast or slow? - A. Fast.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Was he walking well when you saw him? - A. He was walking well.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Did he walk like a well man? - A.\u00a0 He did not appear to have any trouble whatever.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In the light of the condition in which the defendant was at the\u00a0 time alleged, this testimony of the witness\u00a0 is little short of absurd.<br\/><br\/>Beriberi is defined\u00a0 as \"an acute\u00a0 disease occurring\u00a0 in certain tropical regions, chiefly in India and Ceylon, characterized by multiple inflammatory\u00a0 changes\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 nerves, producing great muscular debility, a painful rigidity of the limbs,\u00a0 and a condition of general ill\u00a0 health and malnutrition.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The uniform and invariable accompaniment\u00a0 of beri-beri is\u00a0 the inability to\u00a0 walk naturally, strongly, or rapidly. One medical authority, speaking of a patient suffering from the disease, says, giving it as a typical case:<br\/><blockquote>\"The variety in the severity, progress, and duration\u00a0 of beriberi is infinite; but in all cases the essential symptoms are the same - greater or less\u00a0 oedema, especially over the shins;\u00a0 muscular feebleness\u00a0 and\u00a0 hyperaesthesia, especially of the legs; numbness, especially over the front of the shins; liability to palpitation from cardiac dilation, and to sudden death from the same cause.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Manson, Tropical Diseases, pp. 224, 226.)<br\/><\/blockquote><blockquote>\"On the patient being got out of bed and started to walk, if he is able to progress at all his gait will be markedly ataxic; but he is\u00a0 not ataxic merely, for, just as with the hands,\u00a0 it will\u00a0 be\u00a0 seen that,\u00a0 in addition to a want of co-ordinate power, there is great muscular weakness.\u00a0 If he is laid on the bed and asked to raise his\u00a0 legs, he is perhaps hardly able to\u00a0 get them off the mat, to cross them, or to place one foot\u00a0 on\u00a0 the top of the other.\u00a0 Very probably he is the subject of marked ankle-drop, so that Ke drags his toes when he attempts in walking to advance the foot; he has therefore to raise the foot very high, letting it fall on the ground with a flop when he brings it down again.\u00a0\u00a0 His ataxia and his muscular weakness, as\u00a0 well\u00a0 as the partial ansesthesia from which he suffers, make him adopt all sorts of devices to assist him in progression.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Manson, Tropical Diseases, pp. 224, 226.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Another authority\u00a0 puts it thus:<br\/><blockquote>\"The first characteristic symptom of\u00a0 the\u00a0 disease is the patient's peculiar\u00a0 way of walking, not always easy to describe.\u00a0 The patient ordinarily becomes tired at the slightest exertion;\u00a0 has a sensation of weakness in the joints, especially\u00a0 of the knees. <i> It requires\u00a0 great\u00a0 mental effort and alt the\u00a0 physical strength of\u00a0 the\u00a0 patient to enable him to lift his feet from the ground and\u00a0 move his legs forward <\/i> - hence the peculiar way of walking of those suffering from beriberi, as though they were\u00a0 beating time with the\u00a0 feet, the tendency of the\u00a0 knees to\u00a0 give way, and the common name of the disease,\u00a0 which means 'weakness.'\u00a0 While the patient can walk at all, instead of lifting the foot from the ground gradually,\u00a0 he\u00a0 does so with a jerk by stiffening the knees and keeping the same in that position for\u00a0 a while and then dragging the whole leg forward, first resting\u00a0 on the ground, for this\u00a0 purpose,\u00a0 the big toe and the ball\u00a0 of the foot and immediately thereafter the rest of the foot. As Van Overbeck of Meijer aptly illustrates it, 'they walk as though the legs were wrapped up in soaking wet cloth.' \" (Diccionario Enciclopedico de Medicina y Cirugfa, by\u00a0 Dr. A. Eulenburg, vol. 2, p. 48.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The testimony of Doctor\u00a0 Stallman, taken in connection with the above authorities, demonstrates\u00a0 clearly that it would have been,\u00a0 practically, little short of impossible\u00a0 for the\u00a0 accused to commit the crime charged, under the\u00a0 circumstances.\u00a0 I do not think that the court meant, in\u00a0 the following extract from its opinion, to be taken strictly and literally.\u00a0 It says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Doctor Stallman's testimony can be accepted as true and then the alibi would not, by any means, be established, as he stated that the defendant\u00a0 could have made that trip, and it has been clearly established that the defendant was walking around the town during these days.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Doctor Stallman does not say, unqualifiedly,\u00a0 that the\u00a0 defendant \"could have\u00a0 made that trip.\"\u00a0 He says:<br\/><blockquote>\"He would be able to walk\u00a0 for two or three hours,\u00a0 <i>by stopping at intervals.<\/i>\u00a0 He could walk only with extreme difficulty,\u00a0 I saw him at various times walking in the streets of Abuyog and noticed that it was very difficult for him to walk.\u00a0 I have\u00a0 said\u00a0 that\u00a0 it was very difficult for\u00a0 the accused to walk and that I should judge that it would require four hours for him to walk from Abuyog to Tarragona.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>It is to be noted that the doctor does not say that the accused could have made\u00a0 that trip at all; that\u00a0 is, that trip which he would have been obliged to make to\u00a0 commit the crime charged.\u00a0 He says\u00a0 simply that although\u00a0 the accused had\u00a0 great difficulty in walking, still he could walk from Abuyog to Tarragona if given time enough and if he was permitted to rest at intervals.\u00a0\u00a0 The question is\u00a0 not was the accused able to make\u00a0 that trip.\u00a0\u00a0 The real\u00a0\u00a0 question\u00a0\u00a0 is whether, having in mind all the circumstances, including the admitted physical condition of the accused at the time, it is reasonable to say that he did make the trip.\u00a0 The question\u00a0 is not might he do it, but did he do it.\u00a0\u00a0 It is on record in\u00a0 medical journals that men have been known\u00a0 to walk for rods after\u00a0 having been shot straight through the heart. Nevertheless, no one would hesitate a moment to say that, ordinarily,\u00a0 a\u00a0 person\u00a0 shot through the\u00a0 heart would not be able to walk\u00a0 at all.\u00a0 So here.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is, perhaps,\u00a0 within the realm of possibility that the accused <i>might<\/i> have been able to walk that distance and commit that crime.\u00a0 But I do not think\u00a0 there ought to be a\u00a0 moment's hesitation in\u00a0 saying that, under all the circumstances, he did not do so.<br\/><br\/>I can not bring myself to believe that the accused,\u00a0 afflicted as he\u00a0 was, walked from 12\u00a0 to 16 miles and took an active part in murdering a Chinaman.\u00a0 Especially can I not believe so when the exact contrary is proved by the declarations of the\u00a0 three\u00a0 witnesses\u00a0 whose\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 is not\u00a0 only unimpeached but is richly corroborated\u00a0 by the\u00a0 significant and vital circumstances of the case.<br\/><br\/>As is\u00a0 natural and\u00a0 proper, much\u00a0 stress is laid upon the motive for committing\u00a0 the crime which the accused is alleged to have had.\u00a0 It is admitted that he had been convicted of assault and battery against the deceased, and he\u00a0 was, at the time of the murder, engaged in serving\u00a0 the sentence imposed under\u00a0 such conviction. This may have\u00a0 been\u00a0 a sufficient motive.\u00a0 The\u00a0 attempt, however, to ascribe to the accused the further motive arising\u00a0 from the alleged fact that the deceased was\u00a0 about to make\u00a0 a complaint\u00a0 to the authorities against the\u00a0 village president, Vicente Tiauzon, founded\u00a0 upon his failure\u00a0 to confine the\u00a0 accused\u00a0 in the municipal jail, can not be justified, since it does not appear anywhere in the case that this alleged purpose ever came to the knowledge of\u00a0 the accused.\u00a0\u00a0 The same may\u00a0 be\u00a0 said of the attempt to impute a further motive growing out of the alleged fact that the deceased had complained to\u00a0 the village president himself\u00a0 that\u00a0 the accused\u00a0 should\u00a0 be confined in jail instead of being permitted to go\u00a0 at large.\u00a0 There is no proof whatever that this ever came to the knowledge of the accused.\u00a0 Indeed there\u00a0 is no <i>competent<\/i> proof that\u00a0 such\u00a0 a complaint was ever made at all.\u00a0\u00a0 The only testimony\u00a0 on that subject is that referred to in the opinion of the court where the court says:<br\/><blockquote>\"According\u00a0 to Julia Sopriengco,\u00a0 her father\u00a0 had complained to the president about not confining the defendant, so it was to his interest to testify in favor of the defendant.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>So far as can be\u00a0 gleaned from the\u00a0 record, this is pure hearsay evidence, as it would appear\u00a0 that whatever Julia knew in relation to this matter is\u00a0 what her father told her.<br\/><br\/>In any event, whatever motive the accused may have had is substantially immaterial.\u00a0\u00a0 If he was physically unable to make the journey and effort necessary to commit the murder, that is an end of it, motive or no motive.<br\/><br\/>There being a reasonable doubt of defendant's guilt,\u00a0 he should be acquitted.<br\/><\/div>",

Two of the wounds thus caused and inflicted\u00a0 penetrated the cranium of\u00a0 the\u00a0 said\u00a0 Vicente Toledo.\u00a0 One of\u00a0 the\u00a0 said wounds was inflicted in the back\u00a0 of the neck and measured 4 inches in length by 4 in depth\u00a0 and\u00a0 almost severed\u00a0 the head\u00a0 from the body.\u00a0 Another of the said wounds was in the left shoulder and measured about 4 inches in length by about 4 in depth.\u00a0\u00a0 All the wounds aforementioned were caused\u00a0 by blows with bolos carried by the said accused while they together struck and slew Vicente Toledo.\u00a0 Seven of the\u00a0 said\u00a0 wounds were necessarily\u00a0 fatal, and in consequence thereof the\u00a0 said Vicente\u00a0 Toledo died\u00a0 then\u00a0 and there in the act.<br\/><br\/>\"The\u00a0 following aggravating circumstances entered into the illegal acts committed by the said accused and by each one of them:<br\/><br\/>\"1.\u00a0 The said accused, together and each one of them, had previously formed the\u00a0 intention to kill Vicente Toledo, and acted\u00a0 in conformity with the\u00a0 said intention previously meditated.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 The said accused, all and each one of them, attacked Vicente\u00a0 Toledo with treachery at a time and in a place in which their victim was unarmed, defenseless and completely at the mercy of the said accused.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 The said accused by their arms and number abused their\u00a0 superior strength.<br\/><br\/>\"4.

The said accused, all and each one of them, in attacking and killing Vicente Toledo, did so with unnecessary cruelty\u00a0 and vindictiveness,\u00a0 they\u00a0 having\u00a0 wounded their victim,\u00a0 the aforesaid Vicente\u00a0 Toledo,\u00a0 nine\u00a0 times,\u00a0 thus producing an equal number of wounds,\u00a0 nearly all of them necessarily fatal.<br\/><br\/>\"An act committed with violation of the law.\"<\/blockquote>The Court of First Instance of the^Province of Pampanga convicted them\u00a0 of murder, the element qualifying the crime being treachery.\u00a0 The trial court found as an\u00a0 aggravating circumstance that the crime had been\u00a0 committed in an uninhabited place.\u00a0 Under the judgment of conviction, he sentenced five of the accused, namely, Julio Vitug, Cirilo Baluyot, Matias Baluyot, Agapito Cabuso and\u00a0 Marcelo Cabuso, to death.\u00a0\u00a0 To the other ten, namely, Benito Baluyot, Pedro Maria, Cirilo Maria, Lorenzo Maria, Anacleto Tungol, Gregorio Tungol, Segundo Pangan, Jacinto Pangan, Victoriano Liwanag, and Juan Pelagio, he extended the benefit of the provisions of article 11 of the Penal Code and sentenced each of them to life imprisonment.\u00a0\u00a0 They all appealed.<br\/><br\/>For some time prior to the\u00a0 7th day\u00a0 of October, 1908, rival\u00a0 claims had been made to certain mountain\u00a0 timber lands known as Tibag, near Dampe, in the\u00a0 Province of Pampanga.\u00a0\u00a0 On\u00a0 the one\u00a0 hand,\u00a0 an\u00a0 American,\u00a0 Charles Trotter, claimed that he was the sole owner thereof and had the exclusive right to cut\u00a0 and remove\u00a0 timber therefrom. On\u00a0 the other hand, Clodoaldo Vitug, father of\u00a0 the accused, Julio Vitug, asserted that he was the owner of those lands and had the exclusive right to cut\u00a0 and remove the timber. Each claimant, for\u00a0 some\u00a0 time\u00a0 prior to the date above mentioned, had been engaged in\u00a0 removing timber from the lands for his personal benefit.\u00a0 Although no hostile words had theretofore passed\u00a0 between the rival claimants, and nothing had been done by either openly against the other, nevertheless it is undoubted that bad blood existed between them at the time of the occurrence which gave rise to this action.<br\/><br\/>On the 7th of October aforesaid, early\u00a0 in the morning, said Charles Trotter, accompanied by Vicente Toledo and Jose Cayanan, together with certain laborers, set out from the house of Toledo, having for their destination the timber lands in question, intending to cut and\u00a0 remove\u00a0 timber. Trotter and Toledo were men grown.\u00a0 Jose was about 17. About noon of that day, Trotter, Toledo, Jose Cayanan and a laborer, Patricio. Reyes,\u00a0 left the forest\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose of returning home\u00a0 to secure their midday meal.\u00a0 Just after leaving the forest it was discovered that Jose had left behind a carabao yoke which Toledo had bidden him to bring, and he accordingly\u00a0 returned to fetch it.\u00a0 While Jose was thus engaged, Trotter, Toledo, and Reyes proceeded on their way. They had not gone far when they met Fernando Cayanan, a brother of Jose, about 15 years of age, who was bringing them their food.\u00a0 After it was ascertained that he\u00a0 brought food for only two,\u00a0 Trotter and Toledo, Reyes proceeded on his way, while they sat down and ate.\u00a0 Finishing their meal, they continued their journey toward home, Fernando walking with them.<br\/><br\/>On the same day Julio\u00a0 Vitug, in company with\u00a0 sixteen others, started\u00a0 to\u00a0 go\u00a0 to the said timber lands to\u00a0 cut and remove timber.\u00a0 They followed the\u00a0 same\u00a0 road taken by Trotter,\u00a0 Toledo and\u00a0 the others earlier in the day.\u00a0 They had attained about half the distance from Dampe to Tibag when, between\u00a0 1 and 2 o'clock of the afternoon, they met Trotter, Vicente Toledo, and Fernando Cayanan, traveling as heretofore described.\u00a0 On meeting, a conversation took place between Vitug and\u00a0 Trotter,\u00a0 Toledo\u00a0 acting as interpreter.\u00a0\u00a0 As to\u00a0 what\u00a0 occurred from\u00a0 this moment\u00a0 on, the testimony is conflicting.\u00a0 The main witness for the prosecution, Fernando\u00a0 Cayanan, who was the sole survivor of the party of which he\u00a0 was a member, and who was, therefore, so far as the prosecution is concerned, the\u00a0 sole eyewitness of the affair, testified and asserted that the American was the first to speak; that he asked Vitug where he was going; that Vitug replied that he was going to the forest of Tibag to cut timber; that the American insisted that he should not go, as the lands from which the timber spoken of was to be cut\u00a0 belonged\u00a0 to\u00a0 him; that\u00a0 Vitug and\u00a0 his companions insisted on going ahead and cutting the timber; that the American still objected,\u00a0 but they\u00a0 insisted and exhibited a paper to\u00a0 the American, asking for a\u00a0 receipt; that the American refused to give them one and invited them\u00a0 to go to the <i>presidencia<\/i> to settle\u00a0 the matter;\u00a0 that they\u00a0 refused to go because, as they stated, it would cause them and their animals great damage;\u00a0 that the American said\u00a0 that it would cause him damage\u00a0 also,\u00a0 but that\u00a0 if they would go to the\u00a0 <i>presidencia <\/i>and\u00a0 the matter should\u00a0 go\u00a0 against him\u00a0 he would pay all\u00a0 of the damages occasioned to\u00a0 them thereby; that they refused to do\u00a0 so, but insisted on going forward and cutting the timber;\u00a0 that the\u00a0 American still urged going to the presidencies for the purpose of ascertaining who was the owner of the land in question, saying that if he\u00a0 lost the case he would pay all damages resulting; that they still refused and insisted on going on to cut the timber; that the American still\u00a0 objected;\u00a0 that\u00a0 at this\u00a0 point the defendants dismounted from their carabaos and said, \"it appears that this <i>cono de su madre <\/i>wants us to kill him,\" whereupon all of them surrounded the American\u00a0 and his party, and Vitug said to his companions, \"advance,\" and the American said, \"do not go farther\"; that at this moment two of the defendants seized the American by the arms and tried to throw him to the ground; that he was able, however, to loosen his right hand and with it he struck Vitug in the face;\u00a0 that thereupon they struck him in the head\u00a0 and he fell to the ground, they striking him with their bolos in the head\u00a0 and\u00a0 body;\u00a0 that, while lying on\u00a0 the ground, the American\u00a0 was able to\u00a0 draw his revolver and to discharge several\u00a0 shots; that they\u00a0 then struck him further blows, from which he died immediately; that thereupon the defendants attacked Toledo,\u00a0 Jose, and Fernando\u00a0 Cayanan, Jose having arrived\u00a0 upon the scene with\u00a0 the yoke about the time they attacked Trotter, killing Toledo and Jose in turn and leaving Fernando, the witness, dead, as\u00a0 they supposed, on the ground.\u00a0\u00a0 The witness Fernando, as well as many other\u00a0 witnesses for the prosecution,\u00a0 asserts that of the four constituting Trotter's party, three were\u00a0 wholly without arms,\u00a0 while\u00a0 Trotter carried a\u00a0 revolver and a\u00a0 bolo; that neither Toledo, Jose, nor Fernando used or attempted to use violence against the defendants, and that they were set upon suddenly, unexpectedly, ruthlessly and without cause.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, some of the witnesses for the defendants assert, and this\u00a0 is taken\u00a0 as their defense by all the defendants\u00a0 who\u00a0 admit participation\u00a0 in\u00a0 the event, that Trotter\u00a0 and his party were\u00a0 armed,\u00a0 the former with\u00a0 a revolver and a bolo and his companions each with a bolo; that they assaulted the defendants with bolos in their hands, and that the defendants, in whatever they did, acted purely in self-defense.<br\/><br\/>Of the fifteen\u00a0 defendants, eight were called as witnesses. The witness Agapito Cabuso testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"On our way to Tibag we were stopped by four persons. They asked me where are you going.\u00a0\u00a0 I answered that we were going to Tibag to get out timbers for our employer. The Spaniard\u00a0 (Toledo) said:\u00a0 'Are\u00a0 you going to\u00a0 steal timber?'\u00a0 After asking this, he asked\u00a0 who was the representative of our principal.\u00a0 I told him that it was Julio Vitug.\u00a0 He then asked me\u00a0 to\u00a0 call\u00a0 him, I called to Julio Vitug and he came up to where we were.\u00a0 They asked him where\u00a0 he was going,\u00a0 and he said they were going to get timber which they had been ordered to get in Tibag Mountain.\u00a0\u00a0 The Spaniard said:\u00a0 'You are going to steal timbers.' Julio Vitug answered him and said: 'No, we are not going to steal timber, because that timber belongs to us and in proof of it here is justification\u00a0 of our claim\u00a0 of ownership.' He thereupon drew out a paper which the American took and read, after which he returned it to Vitug.\u00a0\u00a0 Then after this the Spaniard said: 'You must not go there because that property belongs to the American.'\u00a0 Julio Vitug said: 'We will not insist on going there if you will give us a receipt which I can show to my father\/\u00a0\u00a0 After saying this, the American struck him a blow in the face and he fell to the ground, whereupon the American kicked him and stepped upon\u00a0 him.\u00a0\u00a0 On seeing this I dismounted from my carabao, saying: 'Why do you do this; he is not guilty of anything.' After saying this,\u00a0 the American discharged his pistol and hit me in the lower jaw and knocked out some of my teeth. I called to my companions\u00a0 that I was hit and then they began a general fight and as I was defending my life\u00a0 I did not know what was occurring. When I felt that I was hit, I drew my bolo.\u00a0 I do not know what I did because I was defending my life.\u00a0\u00a0 I struck blows in order to defend my life because I was dying.\u00a0 The Spaniard acted merely as an\u00a0 interpreter.\u00a0 I\u00a0 did not see anyone\u00a0 dead and\u00a0 after the fight I went away alone on my carabao.\"<\/blockquote>Marcelo Cabuso testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"We did not arrive at Tibag because we were stopped by an American, a Spaniard, and their two companions.\u00a0\u00a0 My brother was walking in front of me at the time we\u00a0 were stopped,\u00a0\u00a0 I\u00a0 saw that they were talking with my brother. The Spaniard was speaking with him.\u00a0\u00a0 I heard my brother call to Julio Vitug, asking him to\u00a0 come forward,\u00a0 that they wanted him.\u00a0 He went forward and they talked together. I saw Vitug deliver a paper to the American and he read it. After the American had returned the paper he struck Vitug in the face and knocked\u00a0 him down.\u00a0 He then\u00a0 kicked him and stepped on him.\u00a0 At that time I was mounted on my carabao.\u00a0 On hearing the revolver shots, I\u00a0 turned and saw that my brother had been hit. I then got off my carabao and drew\u00a0 my bolo and began to strike with it.\u00a0 I do not know whom I hit because my vision was so obscured that I could not see.\u00a0 After hitting I ran away.\u00a0 I\u00a0 did not see anyone dead nor anyone whom I hit.\u00a0 I got off my carabao, struck with my bolo, and my companions did likewise.\"<\/blockquote>Anacleto Tungol testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"On our way to Tibag and before we arrived there four men stopped us and told us that we could not go any farther. The Spaniard and the American asked to speak with Julio Vitug.\u00a0 On\u00a0 Vitug's presenting himself he took\u00a0 from his pocket a paper and showed it to the Spaniard\u00a0 and he\u00a0 and the American read it.\u00a0 After reading it, it was\u00a0 returned to Vitug, and he took it and put it in his pocket.\u00a0 Thereupon the American struck him in the\u00a0 face and he\u00a0 fell to\u00a0 the ground.\u00a0 The\u00a0 American\u00a0 then kicked him.\u00a0 After he\u00a0 had kicked Julio, the American\u00a0 drew his revolver and commenced to shoot.\u00a0 I got off my carabao.\u00a0 They\u00a0 attacked us like malefactors and we\u00a0 did nothing more than\u00a0 to save our lives.\u00a0 I responded to\u00a0 the\u00a0 attack and\u00a0 attacked\u00a0 myself because my nephew was wounded.\u00a0 I do not know whom I hit,\u00a0 because I was blind. I do not know how many we killed, because I\u00a0 could not see.\u00a0 I got off my carabao\u00a0 and fought, and my companions did likewise,\u00a0\u00a0 When I got back my sight I\u00a0 went away.\u00a0 I had vision\u00a0 enough to get\u00a0 my carabao and see the road but I could not see the\u00a0 corpses.\"<\/blockquote>Jacinto Pangan testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"We were stopped on the way by an American and three companions of his,\u00a0 I am related to Segundo Pangan, Agapito Cabuso, also Marcelo Cabuso and Prudencio Serrano. When we were stopped\u00a0 in the road on the way to Tibag, Agapito\u00a0 Cabuso was wounded.\u00a0\u00a0 When I found\u00a0 out that.he was wounded and when he told me that he was going to die because he had been struck by a bullet and I saw\u00a0 that he was bleeding, I drew my bolo and got off my carabao.\u00a0\u00a0 I engaged in the general fight which followed. I do not know whom I attacked.\u00a0 I do\u00a0 not know whom\u00a0 I hit, because I believed I was\u00a0 going to die and tried to defend myself.\u00a0\u00a0 After\u00a0 I had\u00a0 fought with my bolo I took the bolos from\u00a0 the companions of the American.\u00a0 I\u00a0 do not remember where those companions\u00a0 were when\u00a0 I took the bolos.\u00a0 I did not\u00a0 see them running, but I saw the bolos at their side.\u00a0 I do\u00a0 not remember whether I saw the owners or not when I took the bolos.\u00a0 The way I\u00a0 know\u00a0 that the bolos which I took belonged to the companions of the American was because when they were talking\u00a0 with Agapito\u00a0 Cabuso and\u00a0 Julio Vitug I saw them with\u00a0 bolos in their hands.\u00a0 I did not see the corpses when I took the bolos.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The other witnesses who were called for the defendants upon this Question, namely, Marcos Dabu, Lorenzo Vitug, Donato de los Reyes, Benito Baluyot,\u00a0 Cirilo Maria, Pedro Maria, and Julio Vitug,\u00a0 the last four only being defendants, after describing the conversation which occurred between Vitug and Trotter substantially as had the other\u00a0 witnesses for the defendants, stated further\u00a0 that, upon seeing the American draw\u00a0 his\u00a0 revolver and\u00a0 shoot,\u00a0 they\u00a0 ran away without engaging in the affair and without seeing anything which\u00a0 transpired\u00a0 thereafter.\u00a0 They, therefore, could say nothing whatever about the facts\u00a0 involving the death of Toledo.<br\/><br\/>Many\u00a0 other\u00a0 witnesses\u00a0 were sworn\u00a0 by the defense but none as to the facts involving the death of Toledo.\u00a0 The other defendants, Cirilo Baluyot, Matias Baluyot, Lorenzo Maria, Gregorio\u00a0 Tungol,\u00a0 Segundo Pangan, Victoriano Liwanag, and Juan Pelagio,\u00a0 did not testify.<br\/><br\/>It was\u00a0 stated a\u00a0 moment back that Fernando Cayanan was, apart from\u00a0 the defendants\u00a0 themselves, the\u00a0 only surviving eyewitness to the\u00a0 commission of the crime\u00a0 with which\u00a0 the defendants stand charged.\u00a0 The defendants assert, however, that their party, instead of being seventeen in number, consisted of twenty persons, there being present at the time Toledo was killed, in addition to the defendants named in the indictment, three persons not defendants and, therefore, disinterested, namely,\u00a0 Marcos\u00a0 Dabu,\u00a0 Lorenzo Vitug, and Donato de los Reyes.\u00a0\u00a0 These three persons were produced as witnesses on the trial and, as before stated, gave substantially the same version of the occurrence up to the time of the controversy\u00a0 with Trotter as did the defendants. It is to be noted, however, as we have\u00a0 indicated already, that, according to their testimony, they did not see anything that happened after Trotter began to shoot; each one states that, upon seeing the American draw his revolver and shoot, he ran away without in any way engaging in the affair and without witnessing anything which transpired thereafter. But, irrespective of what these witnesses claim to have seen or not to have seen, the prosecution asserts that the party which\u00a0 engaged in the\u00a0 killing\u00a0 of\u00a0 the decedents and the wounding of Fernando consisted of seventeen persons\u00a0 only and that the three individuals named above were not members thereof.\u00a0 In\u00a0 support of\u00a0 this\u00a0 contention there\u00a0 were produced\u00a0 as\u00a0 witnesses, Fernando Cayanan,\u00a0 who,\u00a0 in his testimony, limited the number of the party to the seventeen persons named in the indictment, saying that, at the opening of the\u00a0 conversation between\u00a0 Trotter and Vitug, the latter, in response to a question of the former inquiring how many were in the party, replied that there\u00a0 were seventeen; Patricio\u00a0 Reyes, who testified that he saw the party\u00a0 at a point near where they met Trotter and his companions, and just before\u00a0 the meeting, and that it consisted of only seventeen persons, each one of whom he identified and pointed out at the trial and among whom was not one of the three persons above mentioned; Captain Ramos, who testified at the\u00a0 trial that Julio Vitug stated to\u00a0 him that his party\u00a0 consisted\u00a0 of only seventeen; and that Donato de los Reyes told him\u00a0 soon after the event that he knew nothing whatever of what had occurred;\u00a0 Mr.\u00a0 Panlaqui,<i> presidente <\/i> of\u00a0 Floridablanca,\u00a0 who testified that Donato de los Reyes\u00a0 told h|m that he knew nothing concerning the death of Toledo, as he, Marcos Dabu and Lorenzo Vitug were far behind the rest and were eating their dinner in Gutad at the time of the occurrence r Antonio Gomez, who, in his testimony,\u00a0 stated that Donato de los Reyes told him that on the 7th of October Julio Vitug asked him to go with him to\u00a0 Tibag\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 purpose of getting timbers, and he replied that he then had to feed his carabaos but would\u00a0 come shortly; that\u00a0 after\u00a0 an hour or\u00a0 so, he, Lorenzo Vitug and Marcos Dabu followed after Julio Vitug and his party but'were met on the way by that party returning immediately after the death of Toledo and the rest.<br\/><br\/>The testimony thus introduced by the prosecution upon this point is reinforced\u00a0 by the admission of Donato de los Reyes himself, made when a witness at the trial, who stated on\u00a0 cross-examination\u00a0 that he had told Gomez that he remained behind, but, by\u00a0 way of explanation of his inconsistency, alleged\u00a0 that he was forced to make such statement because Gomez\u00a0 had pricked\u00a0 him with needles.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u00a0 are satisfied from a thorough\u00a0 examination of\u00a0 the evidence in relation to this particular point that the conclusion of the court below that the\u00a0 party\u00a0 which\u00a0 caused the\u00a0 death\u00a0 of Trotter and his two companions consisted\u00a0 of seventeen persons only and that neither Donato de los Reyes, Marcos Dabu, nor Lorenzo Vitug was a member thereof, is fully sustained\u00a0 by the proofs.<br\/><br\/>In determining the probative force of the testimony introduced by the defendants in relation to the death of Toledo, which testimony involves the question of self-defense, we observe, in the first place, that the witnesses Agapito Cabuso,\u00a0 Marcelo Cabuso, Atiacleto Tungol, and Jacinto Pangan are the only witnesses for the defense who testified to facts touching in any way\u00a0 the\u00a0 death of Toledo.\u00a0\u00a0 In the second place, we note that soon after the commission of the crime each\u00a0 of these\u00a0 witnesses\u00a0 made a confession, which\u00a0 was reduced to writing and\u00a0 was\u00a0 signed and sworn to by each before a notary public.\u00a0 The confession of Agapito Cabuso is dated the 16th day of October, 1908, and was subscribed and sworn to on that date before Vicente Limjuco, a notary public in and for the Province of Pampanga, and witnessed by Aurelio Ramos, captain of Constabulary, and Alfredo B. Cacnio, a stenographer in\u00a0 the employ of the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 In that confession Cabuso declared:<br\/><blockquote>\"That on Wednesday,\u00a0 the 7th day of October, 1908,1 was in my house, situated in the said barrio, when there came to the house Julio Vitug,\u00a0 who told me that he wanted me to accompany\u00a0 him to the\u00a0 forest of Tibag for the purpose of getting logs\u00a0 therefrom.\u00a0\u00a0 Complying with\u00a0 his request, I left my\u00a0 house\u00a0 in company with said Vitug\u00a0 and his companions, who\u00a0 are now\u00a0 in the\u00a0 Constabulary\u00a0 jail of this province.\u00a0 While on the way in the direction of Gutad, one Eugenio Lingad joined us,\u00a0 who stated to Julio Vitug and to my companions that the\u00a0 American, Charles\u00a0 Trotter, accompanied by\u00a0 Vicente\u00a0 Toledo\u00a0 and his brothers,\u00a0 Jose and Fernando\u00a0 Cayanan, were to\u00a0 the\u00a0 north, whereupon\u00a0 Julio Vitug addressed\u00a0 my companions,\u00a0 telling them to be prepared; that in case that the\u00a0 American should attempt to prevent us from\u00a0 getting timber or should illtreat him by word or act, they should cut him to death with bolos.\u00a0 To that end, we prepared our\u00a0 bolos\u00a0 and continued\u00a0 our way, meeting Charles Trotter, Vicente Toledo, and his brothers in a place called\u00a0 Telabanca, where the American, Charles Trotter, and one of our\u00a0 companions, called Julio Vitug; stood talking some moments in reference to the ownership of the forest of Tibag, Vicente Toledo acting as interpreter for the American.\u00a0 After they had talked a while, Trotter and Vitug got into a personal\u00a0 combat, whereupon the American drew his revolver and began to shoot.\u00a0\u00a0 He was seized by Cirilo Baluyot and others of my companions at the same time\u00a0 that the others\u00a0 were cutting him\u00a0 to death. While this was occurring,\u00a0 Vicente\u00a0 Toledo\u00a0 and\u00a0 his\u00a0 companions\u00a0 were\u00a0 imploring\u00a0 pardon,\u00a0 to\u00a0 which Julio\u00a0 Vitug replied, saying: 'Kill all of\u00a0 them; do not leave one alive,' When Trotter was dead we pursued Toledo, overtaking him within about 30 meters, whereupon we cut\u00a0 him\u00a0 to death. While we were\u00a0 cutting Toledo to death, his brothers begged us to pardon him, but\u00a0 we refused, and after killing him we\u00a0 chased\u00a0 Jose Cayanan, overtaking him about\u00a0 4 meters from\u00a0 where we killed Toledo,\u00a0 and thereupon\u00a0 cut him\u00a0 to death, and while this was occurring his little brother Fernando was also praying to us not to injure him; but, as in the other cases, we\u00a0 paid no attention to\u00a0 him; and, after the death of Jose, we pursued Fernando, overtaking him at a distance\u00a0 of something like 4 meters, where we cut him to death also.\u00a0 Those who took part in the\u00a0 assassination of Trotter\u00a0 were Cirilo\u00a0 Baluyot, Matias Baluyot,\u00a0 Segundo Pangan,\u00a0 and I. Those who took part in the killing of Toledo\u00a0 were 1, Cirilo\u00a0 Balnyot,\u00a0 Matias Baluyot, Jacinto Pangan, Segundo Pangan, Marcelb\u00a0 Cabuso, and\u00a0 others. Those who took part in the death of Jose were Cirilo Baluyot, Matias Baluyot, and others, and in that of Fernando, six of our companions\u00a0 whose names I\u00a0 do not now recall. I state\u00a0 that all of us, the seventeen prisoners now in the Constabulary jail, including Julio Vitug, took part directly in the acts above described, they having been carried into effect by the order of Julio Vitug, whom we recognized as our chief.\"<\/blockquote>The confessions of Marcelo Cabuso, Anacleto Tungol, and Jacinto Pangan are the same in substance as that of Agapito Cabuso\u00a0 above quoted.\u00a0 In\u00a0 his confession, Jacinto Pangan adds:<br\/><blockquote>\"I was present at the\u00a0 death of Trotter\u00a0 and his three companions, and I am\u00a0 able\u00a0 to\u00a0 state confidently that the only one who possessed any arms whatever was Charles Trotter, who carried a\u00a0 revolver and a bolo,\u00a0 which\u00a0 bolo is marked 'No. 1.'\u00a0 The\u00a0 bolo which\u00a0 is now\u00a0 shown\u00a0 to me, marked 'No. 2,.' belongs\u00a0 to Anacleto Tungol.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Substantially the\u00a0 same confessions were\u00a0 also\u00a0 made by Cirilo Maria and Benito\u00a0 Baluyot.\u00a0 In\u00a0 his\u00a0 confession the latter said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Trotter and his companions were completely defenseless when my companions killed them.\"<\/blockquote>At the trial\u00a0 evidence was introduced on\u00a0\u00a0 behalf\u00a0 of the defendants tending\u00a0 to\u00a0 demonstrate that the\u00a0 confessions above referred to had\u00a0 been\u00a0 obtained from\u00a0 them through force, duress, and fear, and that they had been compelled to sign and swear to the confessions by the same means.\u00a0\u00a0 We have carefully examined the record in relation to this particular.\u00a0 After a\u00a0 thorough reading of the evidence adduced by both sides upon\u00a0 this question, we, without hesitation, concur in the conclusion of the court below upon that point and find that his opinion\u00a0 that the .confessions were, voluntary and given without promise of reward or clemency is fully sustained.\u00a0 The testimony of Captain Ramos, of Lieutenant Gomez, and of the notary public, Limjuco, leaves no doubt whatever in our mind upon that point.<br\/><br\/>While we, in the decision of this case,\u00a0 use these confessions against the persons who made them, we give them no force or effect against any other defendant.<br\/><br\/>A severe assault has been made by the attorney for the defendants\u00a0 upon the testimony of the witness Fernando Cayanan.\u00a0 It is asserted that his evidence is contradictory, improbable,\u00a0 unreasonable, uncorroborated, and\u00a0 generally unworthy of belief.\u00a0\u00a0 In support of this contention he has placed in his brief copies of\u00a0 statements\u00a0 alleged to have bfeen\u00a0 made\u00a0 by the witness at various\u00a0 times prior to the trial.\u00a0 One\u00a0 such\u00a0 statement is claimed to\u00a0 have been made at the time\u00a0 when and\u00a0 at the\u00a0 place where he\u00a0 was picked up, wounded nearly to death, a short time\u00a0 after the assault. A second is claimed to\u00a0 have been made on the 8th day of October, 1908, before the justice of the peace of Floridablanca.\u00a0 Still another is claimed to have been made before prosecuting attorneys Adams and Veloso\u00a0 on the 10th day of October,\u00a0 1908.\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the defendants vehemently asserts that said three statements are\u00a0 contradictory of each other; that\u00a0 they wholly destroy the testimony given by the witness on the trial of this action; and that, therefore,\u00a0 no credit whatever should be given to his evidence. It must be observed, however, that the alleged statements were\u00a0 not introduced in evidence during\u00a0 the trial of the case.\u00a0\u00a0 They\u00a0 never became a\u00a0 part\u00a0 of\u00a0 the proofs.\u00a0 They are not now and never have been a part\u00a0 of the record in this court.\u00a0\u00a0 We have no knowledge of them whatever except as they appear in\u00a0 the\u00a0 brief of defendant's counsel.\u00a0 We can not, therefore, consider\u00a0 them in the decision of this case,, they not being matters of which we may take judicial notice.\u00a0 The only statement made by the witness Cayanan which we may consider on this appeal\u00a0 is the one formed by the evidence which he gave as a witness for the prosecution upon the\u00a0 trial\u00a0 of this action.\u00a0 A\u00a0 careful and\u00a0 a thorough reading of the proofs, taken in connection with all the circumstances which surrounded\u00a0 the\u00a0 commission of the crime, discloses that the testimony of\u00a0 Cayanan\u00a0 is as richly corroborated in its essential elements as conditions will permit.<br\/><br\/>In the\u00a0 first place, the witness asserts\u00a0 that all of the defendants, with the exception of two, were armed with bolos.\u00a0\u00a0 This statement is admitted to\u00a0 be true by the defendants themselves.<br\/><br\/>In the second place, he states that he and his two brothers, Jose and\u00a0 Vicente, were wholly unarmed at the time the assault was made\u00a0 upon them.\u00a0\u00a0 This\u00a0 statement is contradicted by certain of the defendants, namely, Agapito Cabuso, Marcelo Cabuso, Anacleto Tungol, Jacinto Pangan, Benito\u00a0 Baluyot, and Cirilo Maria.\u00a0 They assert in\u00a0 their testimony that the three companions of Trotter were armed with bolos and that they assaulted the defendants with their bolos drawn.\u00a0\u00a0 The witness Jacinto Pangan claims to have obtained from somewhere the three bolos\u00a0 with\u00a0 which Trotter's companions are alleged to have been armed.\u00a0 The bolos were presented in court by the\u00a0 defendants as conclusive evidence of their claim that Toledo, Jose and Fernando were armed.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 to be noted, however, that the witness Pangan\u00a0 was\u00a0 unable to state\u00a0 where\u00a0 he\u00a0 got the bolos; whether he took them from the hands of the victims, from the sheaths, or from the ground; whether from the bodies of the\u00a0 victims or elsewhere.\u00a0\u00a0 He\u00a0 was, as\u00a0 well, unable to\u00a0 say whether or not he saw the bodies of any of the victims\u00a0 at the time\u00a0 he\u00a0 took\u00a0 the bolos,\u00a0 or\u00a0 whether\u00a0 or not anyone had been killed or injured at all.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, it appears from the\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 of the justice of the\u00a0 peace and of all those who,\u00a0 upon being notified\u00a0 of the tragedy, made an investigation of the facts and recovered the bodies of the victims, that, at\u00a0 the\u00a0 time the\u00a0 bodies were found, a\u00a0 receptacle\u00a0 fo\u00a3 carrying\u00a0 a revolver\u00a0 and\u00a0 a bolo sheath were found upon Trotter's\u00a0 body, but\u00a0 upon the bodies\u00a0 of none of his companions was there discovered either a bolo or a sheath for one.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 the\u00a0 declaration of Guillerma Sibag and of all.the laborers who\u00a0 saw Vicente and\u00a0 Jose leave the house on the morning of the tragedy that neither of them carried a bolo;. and it is the\u00a0 testimony of several persons who\u00a0 saw them upon\u00a0 the way, either\u00a0 coming or going, that neither\u00a0 carried a bolo or other arm.\u00a0 In addition,\u00a0 the\u00a0 probative value of the\u00a0 testimony of Agapito Cabuso, Marcelo Cabuso, Anacleto Tungol, Jacinto Pangan, Benito\u00a0 Baluyot, and Cirilo Maria is completely\u00a0 destroyed by the confessions\u00a0 made\u00a0 by\u00a0 them\u00a0 heretofore mentioned. We do not forget, either, that it appears from the testimony of Captain Ramos that\u00a0 Jacinto Pangan told him soon after the assault that the only one in\u00a0 Trotter's party who\u00a0 was armed was Trotter himself and that neither\u00a0 Jose nor Vicente had a\u00a0 bolo; that the reason why he had\u00a0 stated at first that they all had bolos was because Julio Vitug had ordered him to say so.\u00a0\u00a0 It should\u00a0 also be noted that not one of the defendants was\u00a0 wounded\u00a0 during the alleged fight. It would be but reasonable to suppose that in case Trotter and his companions had assaulted the defendants with their bolos, some of the defendants would have borne the marks of that assault.\u00a0 Not one\u00a0 of them,\u00a0 however,\u00a0 was injured in the slightest except\u00a0 by pistol shots, which shots were admittedly fired by Trotter.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of\u00a0 Fernando upon\u00a0 this point seems thus to be so completely\u00a0 and satisfactorily corroborated as to leave no reasonable\u00a0 doubt that Vicente Toledo,\u00a0 Jose\u00a0 Cayanan,\u00a0 and\u00a0 Fernando\u00a0 Cayanan\u00a0 were entirely\u00a0 unarmed and\u00a0 defenseless at the\u00a0 time they were assaulted by the defendants.<br\/><br\/>In the third place, the witness testified that\u00a0 all of the defendants took direct part in the assault upon the victims. At least four of the defendants who\u00a0 testified admitted'that they themselves took part in the injuries inflicted, but plead self-defense.\u00a0\u00a0 The other defendants who were\u00a0 witnesses at the trial assert that\u00a0 they ran\u00a0 away when\u00a0 the shooting began.\u00a0 Those of the defendants who made confessions state in those confessions\u00a0 that they themselves took direct part in the assault.\u00a0 As\u00a0 to\u00a0 the other defendants,\u00a0 to\u00a0 establish their participation in the\u00a0 commission of the crime, we have only the declaration of the witness Cayanan, whose testimony we are discussing, and\u00a0 that\u00a0 of the defendant Anacleto Tungol.\u00a0 As we have before indicated, Cayanan states positively\u00a0 that\u00a0 the whole party,\u00a0 except Prudencio Serrano and Eugenio Lingad, took\u00a0 direct part in the\u00a0 commission of the crime, Julio Vitug, although unarmed, pursuing the victims and urging that all be killed.\u00a0 The cross-examination of\u00a0 Anacleto Tungol in\u00a0 relation to\u00a0 what he and\u00a0 his companions did at the time of\u00a0 the\u00a0 killing shows the following questions and answers:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. And\u00a0 you\u00a0 personally,\u00a0 what did you do? - A. L dismounted from my carabao and took part in the attack.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.<i> And\u00a0 your companions, what\u00a0 did they do<\/i>? - A. <i> They did the same\"<\/i><br\/><\/blockquote>In\u00a0 contradiction, we have only the testimony of those witnesses who claim to have been present up to the\u00a0 time the shooting began but who then ran away.\u00a0 Of the witnesses so testifying, we\u00a0 have already found\u00a0 that three of them, namely, Lorenzo Vitug, Marcos Dabu, and Donato de los Reyes, were not in fact members of the party\u00a0 committing the crime and knew nothing whatever about the facts thereof.\u00a0 As to the others so\u00a0 testifying, namely, Benito\u00a0 Baluyot, Cirilo Maria, Pedro Maria,\u00a0 and Julio Vitug, we have already seen that Benito Baluyot and Cirilo Maria signed written statements which contradict in every\u00a0 particular their testimony relating to\u00a0 the commission of the crime.\u00a0 This leaves only Pedro Maria and Julio Vitug to dispute\u00a0 the truth of the testimony of the witness Fernando Cayanan.\u00a0 All the other witnesses of the\u00a0 defense upon this point admit, in one way\u00a0 or\u00a0 another, participating\u00a0 directly in the commission of the crime.\u00a0 We have\u00a0 no hesitation in concluding that the trial court was fully\u00a0 warranted in finding that all of the defendants took direct part in the commission\u00a0 of the crime.<br\/><br\/>Lastly, the witness Fernando states that the assault was made by the defendants and not by him and his companions and that the defendants were not acting in\u00a0 self-defense. This declaration is thoroughly and completely corroborated by the testimony of witnesses and\u00a0 by the circumstances of the case itself.\u00a0 It is, as to them, conclusively supported by the six defendants who made\u00a0 confessions.\u00a0\u00a0 As to the others, the declaration of the witness that he\u00a0 and his two brothers\u00a0 ran away\u00a0 from the defendants in an attempt to save their lives, and that they\u00a0 were\u00a0 pursued by all of the defendants and assaulted one after another, is corroborated by the location of the bodies after the assault terminated. It appears\u00a0 from the undisputed evidence\u00a0 in the case that the body of Vicente Toledo was found about 100 meters from the\u00a0 place where Trotter was\u00a0 killed\u00a0 and from the place which Toledo occupied at the\u00a0 time\u00a0 the\u00a0 assault was made on\u00a0 Trotter.\u00a0 The body of Jose was found at\u00a0 about the same distance from the place where he was when the assault was made on\u00a0 Trotter, and the\u00a0 body of Fernando was found at a distance of\u00a0 about 40 meters from the place where Trotter was assaulted and killed.\u00a0 It is evident that if the assault had been made upon the\u00a0 defendants by Vicente, Jose, and Fernando, they would have been surrounded and killed at the place where the assault took place, whereas, if they were not the aggressors but were the ones being assaulted, the\u00a0 number of the\u00a0 assaulting\u00a0 party .being so superior,\u00a0 it would be natural that they,\u00a0 being\u00a0 unarmed, should endeavor to escape,\u00a0 and, in doing so, put as much distance between them and\u00a0 their pursuers as\u00a0 they could. That the defendants pursued them for the distances\u00a0 mentioned and\u00a0 caused the injuries complained of, is indisputable.\u00a0\u00a0 That some of them did so is the uncontradicted testimony of the case.\u00a0 No defendant,\u00a0 even, denies\u00a0 that the victims were pursued and killed by some of the defendants.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 only difference\u00a0 between\u00a0 the testimony of Cayanan and that of the defendants\u00a0 who\u00a0 testified on\u00a0 this point is, that,\u00a0 while Cayanan\u00a0 asserts that all of the defendants pursued and killed, the defendants testifying on this point, without denying that at least\u00a0 a\u00a0 portion of their number pursued and killed, assert that some of them did not.<br\/><br\/>It appearing beyond all question that all of the defendants attacked and\u00a0 pursued Toledo and\u00a0 his two brothers, they unarmed, killing two, Toledo and Jose,\u00a0 and leaving the third,\u00a0 Fernando,\u00a0 for dead, and\u00a0 that\u00a0 the defendants acted with the common\u00a0 purpose of compassing the death of all of Trotter's companions, the plea of self-defense is wholly unsustained.\u00a0\u00a0 Even\u00a0 if it be conceded for the moment that the defendants were assaulted\u00a0 by the\u00a0 four, the right to kill in\u00a0 self-defense ceased when the aggression ceased; and when\u00a0 Toledo\u00a0 and his brothers turned and ran,without having inflicted\u00a0 so much as a scratch\u00a0 upon a single one of the defendants, the right\u00a0 of the\u00a0 defendants\u00a0 to\u00a0 inflict injury upon them ceased absolutely.\u00a0 They\u00a0 had no right to pursue, no right to kill or injure.\u00a0 A fleeing man is not\u00a0 dangerous to the one from\u00a0 whom\u00a0 he flees.\u00a0\u00a0 When danger ceases, the right to injure ceases.\u00a0\u00a0 When the aggressor turns and flees, the one assaulted must stay his hand.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 learned trial\u00a0 court found that the crime was committed with treachery.\u00a0 With that finding we concur.\u00a0 It seems to us clear that the defendants committed the crime for which they stand\u00a0 convicted\u00a0 by the\u00a0 employment of \"means, methods, or forms in the\u00a0 execution thereof\u00a0 which tend directly and specially to insure it without risk to the persons of the\u00a0 criminals\u00a0 arising\u00a0 from the\u00a0 defense the injured party might make.\"\u00a0 The assaulted were\u00a0 wholly unarmed.\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants were, in effect, all armed with bolos.\u00a0 There\u00a0 were\u00a0 fifteen who made the\u00a0 attack.\u00a0 The assault upon Toledo\u00a0 was sudden and unexpected.\u00a0 He was acting\u00a0 simply as\u00a0 interpreter\u00a0 for\u00a0 Trotter.\u00a0 He\u00a0 had done nothing,\u00a0 so far\u00a0 as he knew, or so far as\u00a0 we know, to incur the displeasure of the\u00a0 defendants.\u00a0 He had laid no claim to\u00a0 the\u00a0 lands in dispute.\u00a0\u00a0 He had taken no part in the controversy between Vitug and Trotter.\u00a0 He believed that the trouble over the timber lands was strictly confined to them.\u00a0\u00a0 He took no part personally in the conversation. He was simply a servant performing his work and receiving his pay, having no expectation of attack and no thought of danger.\u00a0 The aggressors being many and fully armed, and their victims few and\u00a0 defenseless, they were\u00a0 directly and especially insured against danger to themselves arising from any defense which Toledo and his friends might offer, particularly in view of\u00a0 the fact that the attack was sudden and unexpected and was made simultaneously by all of the defendants.<br\/><br\/>We do not, however, agree with the court below in the conclusion that there was present in the commission of the crime the aggravating circumstance\u00a0 of despoblado.\u00a0 The mere fact that the crime was committed in an uninhabited place is not sufficient.\u00a0\u00a0 It must be proved, in addition, that the culprit\u00a0 took\u00a0 advantage\u00a0 of the\u00a0 isolation of the locality to commit the crime, either\u00a0 that he\u00a0 might be free from molestation and\u00a0 thus the more\u00a0 surely attain\u00a0 his\u00a0 end, or that he might thereby the better secure\u00a0 himself against detection and\u00a0 punishment.\u00a0\u00a0 (1\u00a0 Viada, 306,\u00a0 307, 308.) Neither of these conditions has\u00a0 been\u00a0 shown.\u00a0 It appears, on the contrary, that the meeting of the defendants and the victims in this\u00a0 particular place\u00a0 was\u00a0 entirely unexpected. There is no evidence that the defendants had formed the intention to kill prior to the meeting.\u00a0\u00a0 There is no evidence that they were seeking the assaulted for any purpose whatever.\u00a0\u00a0 Theintent to kill was formed suddenly and, so far as the evidence goes, the wildness and isolation of the locality contributed\u00a0 nothing to induce that intent.<br\/><br\/>We are also of the opinion that\u00a0 the other aggravating circumstances alleged by the prosecution to have been present at the commission of the crime were not so present. The circumstance of abuse of superiority is swallowed up by and becomes a part of the qualifying element of alevosia. It can not be used for any other\u00a0 purpose here.<br\/><br\/>There is an entire failure of proof of premeditation.<br\/><br\/>Taking into consideration the number who took\u00a0 part in the assault, the numerous wounds\u00a0 received by Toledo do not establish,\u00a0 of themselves,\u00a0 that\u00a0 \"the evil accomplished by the\u00a0 crime\" was \"deliberately increased by\u00a0 causing other evils unnecessary for its execution.\"\u00a0 There\u00a0 is no proof to supplement the evidence of the wounds themselves and we can\u00a0 not, therefore, say\u00a0 that the aggravating\" circumstance described in article 10, paragraph 6, of the Penal Code was present.\u00a0 Such a conclusion would be largely\u00a0 assumption.<br\/><br\/>In imposing sentence upon the defendants, we are constrained to believe, under all the conditions, that the provisions of article 11 of the Penal Code were properly applied by the trial court. We, therefore, make the\u00a0 same application.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with the above findings, we affirm the judgment of conviction; and, there being neither aggravating nor\u00a0 extenuating circumstances,\u00a0 we sentence Julio\u00a0 Vitug, Cirilo Baluyot, Matias Baluyot, Marcelo\u00a0 Cabuso, and Agapito Cabuso to life imprisonment, to be served at the place and\u00a0 in\u00a0 the manner provided\u00a0 by law.\u00a0\u00a0 We sentence Pedro Maria, Cirilo Maria, Lorenzo Maria, Segundo Pangan, Victoriano Liwanag,\u00a0 Anacleto Tungol, Juan Pelagio,\u00a0 Benito Baluyot, Jacinto Pangan, and Gregorio\u00a0 Tungol to twenty years of cadena temporal, to be served at the place and in the manner provided by law.\u00a0 We decree that all\u00a0 of the accused shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the heirs of Vicente Toledo in the sum of Pl,000 and pay, each, one-fifteenth of the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/><i> Arellano, C.

The defendant, who appeared\u00a0 and answered in person, was sick on that day and notified the court\u00a0 of his inability to be\u00a0 present.\u00a0 The court\u00a0 thereupon adjourned the trial of the cause to the 2d day\u00a0 of November following.\u00a0 A notice of the adjournment, giving the date to which the cause had been continued, was sent to the defendant.\u00a0\u00a0 He claims that he did not receive it until after the day to which the cause was adjourned for trial.\u00a0 As a result\u00a0 a\u00a0 default was taken against the\u00a0 defendant,\u00a0 the\u00a0 usual proceedings were\u00a0 had before the court, and on\u00a0 the 6th day of November the usual judgment of foreclosure in the cause was rendered.<br\/><br\/>The defendant\u00a0 upon receiving notice of the rendition and entry of the judgment made the following motion:<br\/><blockquote>\"The defendant in the above entitled cause appears and respectfully shows that\u00a0 he asks upon\u00a0 reasons of justice a new trial\u00a0 upon the following ground:\u00a0 For the reason that I have been the\u00a0 victim of\u00a0 an\u00a0 accident which ordinary prudence\u00a0 would not have been able to avoid, having been sick at the time of the trial and having for that reason been prejudiced in my legal\u00a0 rights in the\u00a0 case; therefore, the judgment is contrary to law.\"<\/blockquote>In\u00a0 order to\u00a0 determine whether or not this court can review the evidence in this case, it is necessary to\u00a0 decide whether the ground upon which the\u00a0 above motion for a new trial\u00a0 is based is a sufficient ground under section 497,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>subdivision 2, of the\u00a0 Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 That sub-division reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"2.

Suarez, as to\u00a0 the payment to D. Angel Ortiz by the\u00a0 defendant of\u00a0 the sum of four hundred and ninety-five pesos and thirty-three centavos\u00a0 (P495.33) and the interest at 10 per cent\u00a0 annually from the 17th day\u00a0 of November, 1906, to the time of its payment, with the costs of the present trial - It is ordered that\u00a0 the\u00a0 defendant deposit\u00a0 the sum above named\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 clerk's\u00a0 office\u00a0 of this court, etc.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The part of the decision above\u00a0 quoted contains all of the findings of fact.<br\/><br\/>The second\u00a0 question in this case is whether or not such findings\u00a0 are sufficient to support the decision.\u00a0\u00a0 The reference to Exhibit A in the decision, which Exhibit A is the mortgage being\u00a0 foreclosed,\u00a0 is not sufficient\u00a0 to\u00a0 make that mortgage a part of the decision.\u00a0\u00a0 We may not, therefore, examine said mortgage upon the theory that such reference incorporated it into the decision so as to become an integral part thereof.\u00a0 Such mortgage could easily have\u00a0 been made a part of the decision if appropriate words for that purpose had been used.\u00a0\u00a0 Such mortgage is not before us.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 only finding of fact contained in the decision is the statement that the facts\u00a0 alleged in the complaint were proved.\u00a0\u00a0 The weight of authority seems to be that the findings of the court may refer to the pleadings for the facts found if\u00a0 such reference is sufficiently distinct and if\u00a0 the facts are sufficiently stated\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 pleadings,\u00a0 (McEwen <i>vs.<\/i> Johnson, 7 Cal., 258; Breeze <i>vs<\/i>.

The judgment of the court below was reversed, and the case remanded with instructions to enter judgment for the plaintiff for the amount and interest mentioned. No costs were allowed to either party in this court. (Pp. 449 to 456, second part of the record.)<br\/><br\/>The instructions given in that decision were complied with by the judge of First Instance and carried out in the following terms:<br\/><blockquote>\"This matter is today before this court, having been remanded by the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, before which an appeal was taken from a judgment rendered in this lower court by the Hon. William J. Rohde, on December 17,1903. The judgment appealed from was reversed and the Supreme Court ordered this court to render another judgment for the plaintiff for an amount different from that contained in the said judgment appealed from, to wit, the sum of 7,981.80 pesos, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the 1st day of January, 1894, and for the costs of this Court of First Instance. It does not clearly appear whether the sum specified in the said decision is in Philippine currency, [or in another currency, but, taking into consideration the date on] which the transactions, the subject of this action, were carried on, this court finds that the sums mentioned are in Mexican currency, and further that the value of 1 peso Mexican currency is the equivalent of 1 peso Philippine currency.<br\/><br\/>\"Let judgment be entered for the plaintiff arid against the defendant for the sum of 7,981.80 pesos Mexican currency, equivalent to P7,981.80 Philippine currency, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, from the 1st day of January, 1894, and for the costs of this instance. - Manila, P. I., April 18, 1906. - (Signed) A. S. Crossfield, judge.\"<\/blockquote>Since then, at the instance of the plaintiff, supplementary proceedings were instituted for the fulfillment and execution of the said judgment, though without results, as no property was found belonging to the debtor upon which to levy an attachment. As an outcome of these proceedings another suit was brought against the said judgment-debtor, Tan-Guinlay, and the firm of German &amp; Co., Ltd., since the plaintiff Quiros alleged that this firm owed the said Tan- Guinlay the sum of P7,741.17 with interest, and he prayed that this amount be applied to the payment of the said executory judgment against Tan-Guinlay. The matter having been brought before this court on appeal, it was found in a decision handed down on January 27, 1909, that as the plaintiff Quiros had not proved that German &amp; Co. owed any sum whatever to Tan-Guinlay, it was proper to affirm as it did affirm the judgment appealed from, with the costs of this instance against the appellant. (Trial record, pp. 776 to 782.)<br\/><br\/>At this stage of the case the judgment-creditor, Gonzalez Quiros, stated to the court in writing that he had learned that the judgment-debtor, Tan-Guinlay, was the owner of a part of the capital belonging to the partnership of Song Fo &amp; Co. and also had a 40 per cent interest in its profits from July, 1903, and that the other partners, Yap Chuy Pun, Lorenzo Yap Caong, Song Fo, and Jose Cembrano To Lo, were concealing the said interest of the judgment-debtor in connivance with him; wherefore, in order to ascertain what share and interest Tan-Guinlay might have in the said partnership, he prayed that the proper investigation be made, and the court issued the following order:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is ordered that each one and all of the partners, Yap Chuy Pun, Lorenzo Yap Caong, Song Fo, Jose Cembrano To Lo, and Carlos Palanca Tan-Guinlay, above mentioned, shall appear before Mr. Thomas Aitken, a practicing attorney and notary public of this city, at the latter's office in the upper story of No. 6 Escolta, who has been appointed as a referee to take all the evidence authorized by this order, on November 16, 1908, at 8 o'clock in the morning, in order that they may, respectively, then and there testify under oath with respect to any property belonging to the said defendant Tan-Guinlay which any of them may have in his possession or under his control, and they shall bring with them all the account books of the said Song Fo &amp; Co. and the inventories and balance sheets of the same for the years from 1903 to 1908, both inclusive, and shall submit each one and all of these records to an examination by the plaintiff and his attorney in so far as the said books, inventories, and balance sheets are subject to examination under the law.<br\/><br\/>\"It is further ordered that Jose Delgado, the Reverend Father Jorge Municha, and the bookkeeper of the said company shall appear at the time and place mentioned and testify in the case as witnesses, and meanwhile all the property of whatever nature belonging to the said defendant, Tan-Guinlay, which may be in the possession or under the control of the said partners or any of them shall be affected by this order, and none of the latter, nor the said defendant himself, shall have any right to sell, assign, or transfer his interest or share in the said property, wholly or in part, until the issuance of a new order in this matter.<br\/><br\/>\"A copy of this order shall be delivered with the least possible delay to the partners before-mentioned and to the defendant himself, together with a copy of the affidavit and petition by reason of which this order is issued, and the said Jose Delgado, the Reverend Father Jorge Municha, and the bookkeeper of the partnership of Song Fo &amp; Co. shall be summoned to appear and testify at the time and place aforesaid. So ordered. Manila, November 13, 1908. By the court.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Signed)\u00a0 Charles S. Lobingier, judge.\"<\/blockquote>By a motion of January 19, 1909, the judgment-creditor Gonzalez Quiros, after having stated to the court that all the facts set forth in his affidavit were fully proven before the referee, Thomas D. Aitken, and that the said partnership of Song Fo &amp; Co. had in its possession a sufficient sum to cover the amount of the judgment and costs to the payment of which the judgment-debtor Tan-Guinlay was sentenced, prayed that the said firm be ordered to pay, in cash, the approximate sum of P16,000, with interest thereon up to the 30th of January, and that, should it fail to make such payment, its property be attached, sufficient to cover the said sum and the costs.<br\/><br\/>The proceedings of investigation solicited by Gonzalez Quiros having been had before the referee Aitken, the latter rendered the following report thereupon:<br\/><blockquote>\"In conformity with the order issued by the said court on November 13, 1908, the undersigned began the work of hearing and taking the testimony of the witnesses mentioned in the said order and continued so to do from day to day until he had heard all the witnesses summoned. The plaintiff at the beginning was represented by attorney C. W. Ney who, during the proceedings, withdrew from his representation of the said plaintiff, after which withdrawal the latter proceeded in his own behalf. The defendant was represented by the attorney Alfredo Chicote.<br\/><br\/>\"The first witness, Jose Delgado, testified that the defendant lived in the house of Song Fo &amp; Co., but that he had no direct knowledge of the defendant's connections with the said company. The witness Uy Se Chiong testified that he was Song Fo &amp; Co.'s bookkeeper and that the said Carlos Palanca Tan-Guinlay was an employee of the said company, at a salary of P40 per month, and that during the years 1904, 1905, 1907 and 1908, the said defendant collected from and owed to the aforementioned company the following sums, respectively: P4,675, P6,773.24, P509.33, and P551.48; but that, to his best knowledge and belief, the defendant had no interest as a partner in the business of Song Fo &amp; Co.<br\/><br\/>\"The witnesses Lorenzo Yap Caong and Song Fo testified that the defendant was a manager of the company, under salary, and that he had no interest in the said company as a partner.<br\/><br\/>\"Julio Rafael, Patricio Ubeda Gallego and Felipe Buntoy testified that they were interested in the Zorrilla Theater and that Song Fo was one of the capitalist partners, the owners of the said theater; but their testimony in no manner showed that the defendant, Carlos Palanca Tan-Guinlay, had any interest whatever in the said theater.<br\/><br\/>\"It is unnecessary to discuss whether the testimony of the various witnesses is or is not satisfactory, for the reason that any contradictions or falsehoods or other reasons which may exist for not believing any of the said witnesses, can be no grounds for concluding that the defendant has any partnership rights in the business of Song Fo &amp; Co., or in the Zorrilla Theater.<br\/><br\/>\"On this account, after a careful examination of all the testimony taken in this proceeding, it is impossible to arrive at any other conclusion than that the plaintiff has utterly failed to prove that the defendant, Carlos Palanca Tan-Guinlay, has any interest whatever in the concern of Song Fo &amp; Co., the Zorrilla Theater, or any other business. Manila, Philippine Islands, March &amp;, 1909. (Signed) Thos. D. Aitken, referee.<br\/><br\/>\"I received a copy of the foregoing. (Signed) Alfredo Chicote, for Chicote and Miranda.<br\/><br\/>\"I received a copy of the foregoing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Signed) Quiros.\"<\/blockquote>By a written petition of March 10, 1909, the judgment creditor Quiros stated to the court that he had received a copy of the report rendered in the matter by the referee, Thomas Aitken; that this report was contrary in all its parts to the evidence produced before the same party, and that, in view of the allegations therein set forth, he relied upon his previous petition presented on the 20th of January (p. 795 of the trial record), and asked for what he had therein requested; wherefore the judge, by<i> an order of March 12, 1909, <\/i>stated that he was of the opinion that the referee's report, finding that the evidence was insufficient to show that the defendant had such interest as was claimed by the plaintiff, was justified by the evidence and he therefore confirmed the said report, since it was not shown that the said defendant had any interest in the partnership of Song Fo &amp; Co., as alleged in the plaintiff's affidavit and petition.<br\/><br\/>The judgment-creditor, Gonzalez Quiros, being notified of this ruling of March 12, excepted thereto by a written motion presented on March 15, 1909, and prayed for a review of all the proceedings had and of the documents filed during the trial, in consideration of the reason set forth in his motion, notice of which was given to the judgment-debtor, Palanca Tan-Guinlay; but the judge, after considering the said motion and having heard the plaintiff in his own behalf, <i>declared by an order of the 22d of the same month of March, that he did not find sufficient reason for changing the previous order, and that he therefore denied the review solicited. <\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 (Trial record, fifth part, p. 986.)<br\/><br\/>In view of this denial the judgment creditor, Gonzalez Quiros, by a motion of the 24th of the said month of March, prayed that the manager and administrator of the partnership of Song Fo &amp; Co. be ordered to file with the court, within two days, an abstract of the credit and debit accounts credited to and charged against Carlos Palanca Tan- Guinlay, the general manager of the said firm, on its books, from July, 1903, together with its commercial books, for the purpose of ascertaining what balances the judgment debtor had, and that such books be examined by the. translator, the friar Jorge Municha. He also prayed that Patricio Ubeda, the manager of the firm of Patricio Ubeda &amp; Co., should file an exact copy of the balance sheet drawn up by the latter, so that it might be positively known what profits pertained to the firm of Song Fo &amp; Co. and to its general manager, Carlos Palanca Tan-Guinlay, the judgment debtor.<br\/><br\/>By another written motion of the following day, March 25, he prayed that the said judgment debtor should exhibit in court the books of the said company showing the entries of the sums delivered to its partner, Lorenzo Yap Caong, during the months of November and December, 1908, and January and February, 1909; and that the parties named in the motion be summoned and required to testify under oath in answer to such questions as should be asked them by the petitioner. A copy of these documents was delivered to the judgment-debtor for the purpose of a hearing upon the motion on a day set.<br\/><br\/>At this stage of the proceedings Thomas D. Aitken, by a motion presented April 7, petitioned the court that it fix, in an order, his fees as referee in the sum of P450, in accordance with section 788 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and that this amount be considered as costs against the plaintiff Gonzalez Quiros, stating that an execution might issue against the same for the collection of said sum as costs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Trial record, fifth part, p. 997.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment-creditor, being notified of this motion of the referee Aitken, asked, by a written counter-petition of April 13, 1909, and for the reasons therein set forth, that the aforementioned referee's petition be disallowed, since, in case he had any right to such fees, their payment was incumbent upon the judgment-debtor, the Chinaman Tan-Guinlay; and that instead of allowing the referee's petition, consideration be given to the plaintiff's counter-petition for the sum of P325, as an indemnity for the conduct observed by the defendant and for the latter's five months' delay, leaving it to the discretion of the judge to take such action as the law demanded with respect to the alteration of the stenographic notes and the important concealments which he made in the report presented on the 4th of March, 1909.<br\/><br\/>The referee Aitken being notified of the preceding petition, in a writing found on page 1005 of the record absolutely denied the plaintiff's allegation that the stenographic notes had been changed except in so far as they were corrected by the witnesses themselves, and that, furthermore, such corrections were made in them in the presence of the judgment creditor. And, in view of the fact that, as he alleged, the documents exhibited contained malicious falsehoods and were of an insulting\" nature toward the referee, he asked that the judgment creditor Quiros be reprimanded and punished for contempt.<br\/><br\/>In view of the preceding motions the judge, <i>by an order of April 29, 1909, <\/i>and for the reasons therein expressed, warned the plaintiff that he must refrain from filing papers containing false and incongruous statements, else they would be stricken out pursuant to section 107 of the Code of Civil Procedure; <i>and he overruled the petitions presented<\/i> by the judgment-creditor in the latter's <i>two previous motions<\/i>, stating that the plaintiff must not expect that he would be permitted to incur further costs in such proceedings until he had paid the fees of the referee, which fees the clerk of the court was directed to tax in accordance with section 792 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in connection with section 791 of the same.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Trial record, sixth part, pp. 1018, 1019.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment-creditor, Gonzalez Quiros, being notified of this order <i>took exception <\/i>thereto, by a writing of May 4, 1909, and asked, for the reasons therein stated, that the report of the referee Aitken be set aside, that his counter-petition of April 13 be considered, and that, in case the fees of the said referee were allowable they be left until the conclusion of the case in accordance with the law. He also asked for a review of all the proceedings had, for the purpose of executing the judgment rendered in this case. After the costs had been fixed (p. 1024 of the record), Without opposition on the part of the judgment-creditor, they were approved by the clerk of the court (back of p. 1024 of the record), and the judge, by an order <i>of May 8, 1909, overruled the motion <\/i>presented by the judgment creditor Quiros.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Trial record, sixth part, p. 1025.)<br\/><br\/>By a writing of June 26, 1909, the judgment-creditor, Gonzalez Quiros, petitioned that the referee Aitken should rectify his report presented on the 4th of March of the same year and render a new and correct one, and also that the said referee's petition, with regard to the fixing of the costs, be denied and that he be compelled to comply with his duty without allowance of any other action or rights than those stipulated between him and Ney.<br\/><br\/>The judge,<i> by an order of July 26, 1909, denied <\/i>the plaintiff's petition relative to the correction by Aitken of his previous report, as well as all the other petitions contained in his motion of June 26. (Trial record, sixth part, p. 1045.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment-creditor, Gonzalez Quiros, being notified of this order, excepted thereto on the 28th of July, and asked the court to order a review of all the proceedings had and the execution of the judgment rendered in this case. This motion, which was notified to the contrary party, was overruled <i>by an order of the 31st of the same month of July,<\/i> (Trial record, sixth part, p. 152.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment-creditor being notified of this, last ruling, took exception, by a writing of August 6th, to each and all of the rulings made on the motions which he had presented since the presentation of the referee's report on March 4, last, and prayed the court to allow him a delay for the filing of the necessary bill of exceptions, which motion was granted by order of August 14, 1909, and on the bill of exceptions being presented, it was certified and forwarded to this court.<br\/><br\/>For the purpose of the fulfillment and execution of the judgment rendered in this case in favor of the creditor Gonzalez Quiros, and in order to ascertain and prove whether the judgment-debtor, Palanca Tan-Guinlay, really had any interest or share in the partnership denominated Song Fo &amp; Co. the court ordered, at the instance of the said judgment-creditor, the institution of various supplementary proceedings, involving the examination of several witnesses, and appointed for this purpose Attorney Thomas Aitken as referee.\u00a0\u00a0 In view of the report of the investigation submitted by this referee, and the statements made by the judgment-creditor, the judge, <i>by an order of March 12,1909,<\/i> and for the reasons therein set forth, approved or confirmed the said report.<br\/><br\/>This order brought the aforementioned investigations to an end, by accepting the finding of the referee in his said report that, from the proceedings had, it was not proved that the judgment-debtor Palanca Tan-Guinlay had a share or interest in the partnership of Song Fo &amp; Co. or in any business carried on by the same; and notwithstanding that the judgment-creditor, Gonzalez Quiros, by a motion of March 15th, excepted to the said order and at the same time asked for a review of all the proceedings had and of the documents presented, he did not file the required bill of exceptions for the proper action to be taken thereon, nor did he take exception to the order of the 22d of the same month of March. The review requested was disallowed on account of there not being a sufficient reason for changing the previous order.<br\/><blockquote>\"Exception may be taken,\" recites section 141 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \"to any other ruling order, or judgment of the court made during the pendency of the action in the Court of First Instance.\"<\/blockquote>Section 143 of the same code, among other provisions, prescribes as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The party desiring to prosecute the bill of exceptions shall so inform the court at the time of the rendition of final judgment, or <i>as soon thereafter as may be practicable<\/i> and before the ending of the term of court at which final judgment is rendered, and the judge shall enter a memorandum to that effect upon his minutes and order a like memorandum to be made by the clerk upon the docket of the court among the other entries relating to the action. <i>Within ten days after<\/i> the entry of the memorandum aforesaid, the excepting party shall cause to be presented to the judge a brief statement of the facts of the case sufficient to show the bearing of the rulings, orders, or judgments excepted to, and a specific statement of each ruling, order, or judgment that has been excepted to, for allowance by the judge.\"<\/blockquote>The record does not show that the judgment creditor, who excepted to the said final order of March 1?, 1909, presented the necessary bill of exceptions within the ten days specified by law for its admission and prosecution, and furthermore the said order having been confirmed by another of the 22d of the same month, the judgment-creditor Quiros made no objection whatever to this second order, which was ostensibly assented to, inasmuch as in subsequent motions of the 24th and 25th he asked that other proceedings be instituted conducive to the same purpose sought by the commission intrusted to attorney Aitken.<br\/><br\/>The judgment-creditor himself, by a motion of August 6, 1909, took exception to and appealed from each and all of the judicial orders issued on the subject of his written motions presented since the submission of the referee's report on the 4th of the month of March aforementioned. May it be understood that exception to and appeal from the two said orders of March 12 and 22, approving the impugned report of the referee, was taken, at the end of four months and twenty-four days - contrary to the provision of the law providing that exceptions must be taken as soon as possible?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The impropriety of the untimely appeal made from the two said orders of the month of March is evident.<br\/><br\/>The order of April 29, 1909, disallowing the prosecution of other new supplementary proceedings for the same purpose, that of ascertaining the share of the judgment-debtor in the aforesaid Chinese partnership of\u00a0 Song Fo,\u00a0 was likewise excepted to, by a writing of the 4th of May following, wherein at the same time the judgment-creditor asked that the said referee's report be set aside and his counter-petition be considered; but he did not file the required bill of exceptions within the period fixed by law for its approval and prosecution.<br\/><br\/>Can the said order of April 29, 1909, be considered as excepted to and appealed from by the appeal taken in the writing before mentioned under date of August 6, 1909 -\u00a0 after the lapse of three months and six days? The impropriety of the said appeal is also unquestionable, on account of its not having been entered in due time.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the order of May 8, 1909, disallowing the judgment-creditor's petition to set aside the referee's report before mentioned, that of the 26th of July following, denying the prayer made by the said judgment-creditor that the said referee rectify his previous report and render another new and correct one, and that of the 31st of the same month of July, denying the judgment-creditor's petition that the court order a review of all the proceedings had, are all judicial orders from which no appeal whatever lies, as they are in denegation of petitions tending to weaken or destroy the final orders of the 12th and 22d of March, 1909, which would be the subject of discussion and opposition, notwithstanding the irrevocable character with which they are vested, were the appeals entered against them admitted.<br\/><br\/>If the appeals taken by the judgment-creditor were allowed, it would give rise to the question whether the judge ought or ought not to have granted the petition to set aside or to rectify the referee's report, already approved by final orders, the petition that the said referee render another more exact report, and that made asking for a review of the proceedings had by the latter, already denied by another previous order which was also final, none of which could under any consideration be permitted, as it would be contrary to the law, which upholds the sanctity of all rulings that have become <i>res adjudicata.<\/i><br\/><br\/>It was not proved that the aforementioned orders of the 12th and 22d of March, and the 29th of April, were null and void or that they had not acquired a final character, and therefore the subsequent orders of the 8th of May and the 26th and 31st of July, issued in consequence of the preceding orders, which were already of themselves irrevocable, can not be appealed.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the appeals entered by the judgment-creditor Francisco Gonzalez Quiros from the said orders are declared to be improper, and therefore the bill of exceptions forwarded to this court should not have been prosecuted. The costs are taxed against the appellant.

Rep., 343.)<br\/><br\/>From the decision of the board of special inquiry the plaintiff appealed to the Collector of Customs, who affirmed the decision of said board. From the decision of the Collector of Customs the plaintiff appealed to the Court of First Instance, which court decided that the plaintiff had been given a full and fair hearing by the Bureau of Customs; that there had been no abuse of authority, and affirmed the decision of the Collector of Customs.<br\/><br\/>From that decision the plaintiff appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>Upon an examination of the record brought here we find no reason for reversing the judgment of the lower court. The plaintiff himself swore that he was 21 years of age and so did his father.\u00a0\u00a0 Not being a minor, he was not entitled to enter the Philippine Islands simply for the purpose of being under the care and custody of his father. The plaintiff admitted that he had never been in the Philippine Islands before. The judgment of the lower court is therefore affirmed with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

In compliance with these instructions of his father, Santiago proceeded to\u00a0 the place\u00a0 designated, and while at work doing what he had\u00a0 been ordered by his father to do,\u00a0 Gregorio Esmedia appeared on the scene\u00a0 and\u00a0 started a\u00a0 quarrel with Santiago.\u00a0 Soon thereafter Gregorio\u00a0 drew a\u00a0 dagger and stabbed Santiago in the back.\u00a0\u00a0 Santiago fell to the ground, but arose immediately\u00a0 and attacked Gregorio with his bolo, inflicting several wounds\u00a0 on the said Gregorio in consequence of which he fell to the ground.\u00a0 Before this trouble finally terminated\u00a0 the\u00a0 two accused and Ciriaco Abando appeared in that immediate vicinity.<br\/><br\/>These two accused contend\u00a0 that they were working in their\u00a0 rice field near by, and on seeing\u00a0 Ciriaco Abando and Santiago\u00a0 Abando\u00a0 attacking their\u00a0 father, Gregorio,\u00a0 they started to the place to\u00a0 render their father assistance, Ponciano starting first; that when Ponciano got near the place of the\u00a0 trouble he was met by Ciriaco and Santiago\u00a0 who attacked him with bolos and clubs and that he, Ponciano, in self-defense, knocked them both down,\u00a0 and after they had fallen the other accused, Mena Esmedia, arrived.\u00a0 Ponciano further contends that he did not use a bolo in this fight, but used a club only.<br\/><br\/>The prosecution in the court below contended that when these two accused saw the fight between their father and Santiago they rushed to\u00a0 the place and proceeded to kill, as they thought, Santiago, and on seeing Ciriaco approaching they met him and killed him outright.<br\/><br\/>As a result of this fight Ciriaco was\u00a0 left\u00a0 dead on the scene,. Gregorio\u00a0 received fatal wounds from which he\u00a0 died within\u00a0 about four hours, and Santiago also received fatal wounds from\u00a0 which he died five days later.<br\/><br\/>Ciriaco Abando received two wounds on the top of his head, one\u00a0 8 centimeters and the other 3 centimeters in length,\u00a0 caused by\u00a0 some cutting instrument, and also\u00a0 sustained a fracture of the skull, apparently caused by means of a blow.\u00a0\u00a0 He also had a wound on the head 3 centimeters in depth; another on the neck\u00a0 below\u00a0 the left ear 3 1\/2 centimeters\u00a0 in depth and 3 centimeters\u00a0 in length; the left eye was bruised and he also had a wound on the palm of the right hand 3\u00a0 centimeters in length and\u00a0 2\u00a0 millimeters in depth.<br\/><br\/>Santiago Abando received in all seven wounds, one crosswise of the head,\u00a0 back\u00a0 of the left ear, 8 centimeters in length and 1\u00a0 centimeter in depth,\u00a0 another\u00a0 on top of the head, just\u00a0 above the first wound, 5 centimeters in length and a half centimeter in depth, a third wound on the left part of the neck 4 centimeters in length, all of these three wounds having\u00a0 been caused by a\u00a0 cutting instrument;\u00a0 a fourth wound, also\u00a0 caused by some\u00a0 sharp\u00a0 instrument,\u00a0 1 centimeter in depth and 8 centimeters in length, on the top of the head; a fifth wound, 2\u00a3 centimeters in length and\u00a0 5 millimeters in depth, which was in the nature of a contusion, appeared on the\u00a0 frontal region of the\u00a0 head; a sixth wound, 2 centimeters\u00a0 in\u00a0 length and 3\u00a3 centimeters\u00a0 deep, in the back; and a seventh wound on the left hand, 4 centimeters in length, 2\u00a3 centimeters wide, and 2 millimeters in depth, which had apparently been caused by some cutting instrument.<br\/><br\/>The body of Gregorio Esmedia showed four wounds; a wound or bruise on tjie front of the head, 5 by 6 centimeters in dimension;\u00a0 another wound, caused by a cutting instrument, running across the\u00a0 head, 6\u00a0 centimeters in\u00a0 length; another\u00a0 wound, apparently caused by\u00a0 a blow with\u00a0 some blunt instrument, on the breast; and another wound 1 centimeter in depth, apparently caused by\u00a0 a cutting instrument, and also a bruise on the left arm.<br\/><br\/>The accused, Ponciano Esmedia, received one wound on the\u00a0 head, but\u00a0 it was not\u00a0 of a serious\u00a0 nature; the other accused,\u00a0 Mena Esmedia, escaped uninjured.<br\/><br\/>The prosecution presented Andrea Lactoson, 60 years of age, wife of the\u00a0 deceased Ciriaco, and Julian Alagos,\u00a0 a young boy about 16 years of age, a\u00a0 grandson of Ciriaco. These two witnesses saw the fight and gave a detailed account of the same.\u00a0\u00a0 While it is true that these two witnesses contradicted themselves to some extent on\u00a0 cross-examination, they having testified on direct examination that Ciriaco never did reach the scene of the fight\u00a0 but was\u00a0 killed by the two accused while on his way there,\u00a0 whereas on cross-examination\u00a0 they testified that Ciriaco was there when the accused arrived, yet it is clear\u00a0 that they intended to say that when the two accused\u00a0 arrived\u00a0 Ciriaco\u00a0 was in\u00a0 that vicinity but they did not mean to say that he was at the very side of his son.<br\/><br\/>The theory of the defense\u00a0 that Ponciano was attacked by Ciriaco and Santiago is untenable, as the nature and character of the wounds on the bodies of these two persons show clearly that at least some\u00a0 of them were inflicted by bolos, and Ponciano must\u00a0 have used a bolo in the fight, though he contends that he only made use of a club.\u00a0 The bolo wounds\u00a0 on the heads\u00a0 of Gregorio and\u00a0 Santiago were of such a serious nature that it would\u00a0 have been impossible for them to have\u00a0 gone any distance after having\u00a0 been wounded.\u00a0 So they\u00a0 could not have rushed toward Ponciano and attacked him\u00a0 after\u00a0 having received these wounds. Santiago was stabbed in the back by Gregtfrio, but this wound of itself was not necessarily fatal.<br\/><br\/>After a careful consideration of this entire record we are thoroughly satisfied that\u00a0 the following facts, aside from those we have already related, have been\u00a0 established:<br\/><br\/>The two\u00a0 accused\u00a0 arrived on the scene about the time the fight between Santiago and Gregorio was terminating, and on\u00a0 seeing\u00a0 their father, Gregorio, lying\u00a0 in the mud and water, fatally wounded and\u00a0 dying,\u00a0 and honestly believing that Santiago, who\u00a0 was standing at the time, would inflict other wounds upon their father, they, in\u00a0 his defense,\u00a0 immediately killed Santiago.\u00a0 Ciriaco was near the scene at this time and on seeing him the two accused, under this great excitement, proceeded to attack him, and as a direct result of the blows\u00a0 inflicted by them he fell to the ground, dying\u00a0 immediately.\u00a0 Ciriaco was an old\u00a0 man,\u00a0 about\u00a0 80 years of age, and used a cane to assist\u00a0 him in walking about.<br\/><br\/>Under the provisions of No, 5, article 8 of the Penal Code, the two accused are\u00a0 exempt from criminal responsibility for having caused the death of Santiago Abando, inasmuch as it has\u00a0 been shown\u00a0 that they inflicted these wounds upon him in defense of their father who was fatally wounded at the time.\u00a0\u00a0 They honestly\u00a0 believed, and had good grounds upon which to found their belief, that Santiago would continue his attack\u00a0 upon their\u00a0 father.\u00a0 They are, however, guilty of having caused the death of the old man, Ciriaco Abando.\u00a0 When they attacked and\u00a0 killed him\u00a0 the other trouble had terminated and\u00a0 they were not in danger\u00a0 of bodily harm from him.<br\/><br\/>In the commission of this crime of homicide, we must take into consideration\u00a0 No. 20 of article\u00a0 10 of\u00a0 the Penal Code which provides, as an aggravating circumstance, that \"when the act is committed with insult or\u00a0 in disregard for the respect which may be\u00a0 due the aggrieved party\u00a0 on account\u00a0 of his\u00a0 rank, age,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"\u00a0 inasmuch as\u00a0 the deceased, Ciriaco,\u00a0 was a man 80 years of age and did not arrive on the scene until after the trouble between the two accused and Santiago had terminated.<br\/><br\/>As\u00a0 we have said, these two accused killed this old man, Ciriaco, while laboring under great excitement and in the heat of passion, and it might be insisted that under these circumstances they should be given the benefit of No. 7 of article 9 of the Penal Code,\u00a0 as an extenuating circumstance. This provision should be applied to reduce the penalty in cases where the provocation which caused the heated passion was made\u00a0 by the\u00a0 injured party.\u00a0 In the case at bar the provocation was made by Santiago\u00a0 and not Ciriaco, as Ciriaco\u00a0 arrived after the fight had terminated and there was then no provocation\u00a0 running from the old man,\u00a0 Ciriaco, to these accused.\u00a0 He was\u00a0 entirely\u00a0 unarmed and made\u00a0 no demonstration and said no\u00a0 word prior to the assault upon him by\u00a0 the two accused.\u00a0 So the state of mind into which these\u00a0 two accused\u00a0 were thrown by the provocation induced by Santiago can not modify the extent of their punishment for killing\u00a0 the old man.\u00a0 In\u00a0 other words, before\u00a0 this provision can be applied as\u00a0 an extenuating circumstance it is necessary, as we have said, that the person injured should have executed the\u00a0 act producing arrebato y obcecacion.\u00a0 It can not be\u00a0 applied when\u00a0 an assault is made upon a person who had taken no part in the quarrel and had not in any manner provoked\u00a0 the accused.\u00a0\u00a0 (Decision of the supreme court\u00a0 of Spain\u00a0 dated October\u00a0 17,\u00a0 1904,\u00a0 published in\u00a0 the Official Gazette on December 23 following; decision of the supreme court of Spain dated January 12, 1894; White<i> vs.<\/i> State, 44 Tex.

The purport of\u00a0 this\u00a0 document is\u00a0 that Juliana Samonte declares therein that she is the owner of a fishery which she inherited from her grandfather,\u00a0 Jose Samonte, the situation, measurements and boundaries of\u00a0 which are shown in her title of ownership, made a part of this document, and states further that the said fishery is now leased to another person for a period of time which will not expire for six years; and it\u00a0 is covenanted that\u00a0 she sells the said land to Alejandro Rojas and his wife,\u00a0 Faustina Meneses, for 1,100 pesos, the receipt of which she acknowledges, and that as soon as the six years of the lease in force shall have elapsed and the possession of the land shall be returned to her,\u00a0 she will immediately deliver the property to the said husband and wife, without the necessity of any judicial proceeding, guaranteeing them peaceful possession.<br\/><br\/>This is respondent's Exhibit No. 1, and the title of ownership alluded to\u00a0 by the\u00a0 seller Juliana Samonte, considered as a part of the\u00a0 contract, is respondent's Exhibit No. 2, which is precisely the\u00a0 instrument of composition\u00a0 or title of ownership of the said Juliana Samonte that was\u00a0 introduced in\u00a0 this suit by the respondent.\u00a0 Respondent's Exhibit\u00a0 No. 5\u00a0 is a petition from\u00a0 Alejandro Rojas,\u00a0 addressed to the municipal\u00a0 president of the pueblo of Bulacan, on August 30, 1901, soliciting a sort of ratification of the contract\u00a0 executed by Juliana Samonte in his\u00a0 favor,\u00a0 for\u00a0 the reason that, up to that date, there was neither a justice of the peace in the pueblo nor a notary\u00a0 in the province; and, as a consequence of this writing, respondent's Exhibit No. 4 was introduced, which contains a record of the proceedings had before the municipal president of the\u00a0 pueblo of Bulacan, which consisted of the testimony of all who subscribed to the said contract of purchase and sale executed by Juliana Samonte in favor of Alejandro Rojas.<br\/><br\/>Felix Villanueva testified that he identifies the contents of the said\u00a0 document and also the signature of his\u00a0 name and surname, with his rubric,\u00a0 which appears at the end thereof, and that this\u00a0 document was executed during\u00a0 the lifetime of his wife, Juliana Samonte, of her own free will, with the consent of the witness, and that she received from the purchasers the sum of 1,100 pesos as the price of\u00a0 the sale.\u00a0 The\u00a0 three remaining witnesses,\u00a0 Catalino Morelos, Florencio Samonte, and Vidal Marcelo, testify that they also identify\u00a0 the said document and the\u00a0 signatures of\u00a0 their names and surnames, with their rubrics, which appear at the end of the same, and that\u00a0 the document was executed in their presence by Juliana Samonte y Rodriguez with the consent of her husband, Felix Villanueva, by their free and and wife received in cash the sum of 1,100 pesos as the price of the property.<br\/><br\/>The other private document, also drawn up in Tagalog, appears to set forth that the brothers Eugenio de los Reyes and Leon de los Reyes sold their fishery to Alejandro Rojas and his wife Faustina\u00a0 Meneses for 1,100 pesos, of\u00a0 which they acknowledge to have already received 634\u00a0 pesos, and the document is signed, instead of by those who appear to be the executors, by another Eugenio de los Reyes, apparently an uncle of the same, andrby two others surnamed Mendoza (respondent's Exhibit No. 3).\u00a0\u00a0 As will be seen hereinafter, this document\u00a0 is of no\u00a0 importance and may be\u00a0 considered as excluded from the\u00a0 record, as may also\u00a0 the respondent's claim with respect to the other half\u00a0 of\u00a0 the fishery that belonged to the deceased Atanasia Samonte whose children are,\u00a0 as before stated, Eugenio and Leon de los Reyes, who appear as the executors of the document, and Margarita de los Reyes, of whom no mention is made therein.<br\/><br\/>And finally, respondent's Exhibit 6 is the instrument of composition or of ownership of Atanasia Samonte, without the least explanation as to how\u00a0 or why it was made a part of the record.<br\/><br\/>With this documentary evidence and the testimony of the witnesses on both sides,\u00a0 the Court of\u00a0 Land Registration decided the case by denying the registration solicited by the applicants of that\u00a0 part of the fishery in question which belonged to the deceased Juliana Samonte, and ordered the adjudication and registration of the other half of the said fishery in the\u00a0 name of the petitioners\u00a0 Mariano,\u00a0 Silvestra, Candida, Juan, and Cipriana, surnamed Gonzalez y\u00a0 Silva, as the coowners of the same in equal undivided shares.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 petitioners appealed from the first finding of\u00a0 the judgment,\u00a0 but\u00a0 the\u00a0 respondent did not appeal\u00a0 from\u00a0 the second.\u00a0 It therefore became final, and for this reason that document, Exhibit No. 3\u00a0 of the respondent, must be considered as excluded and all claim on his part to the second half\u00a0 of the fishery is abandoned.<br\/><br\/>The appellants alleged error in the\u00a0 judgment appealed from, for the following reasons:<br\/><ol><li>Because respondent's Exhibit No. 1,\u00a0 or the\u00a0 private instrument executed in\u00a0 his favor by Felix Villanueva, was admitted as evidence;<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>Because a part of respondent's Exhibit No. 4, that is, the ratification of his Exhibit No. 1 by Felix Villanueva before the former municipal\u00a0 president\u00a0 of Bulacan,\u00a0 was admitted as evidence;<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>Because respondent's Exhibit No.\u00a0 1 was not declared to be false, and therefore the sale which it is alleged was executed by Juliana Samonte in favor of Alejandro Rojas, was supposed to have been effected;<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>Because article 1473 of the Civil Code was not applied to this case; and<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>Because the registration\u00a0 in\u00a0 favor of\u00a0 the petitioners of the part of the fishery that belonged to\u00a0 the deceased Juliana Samonte was denied.<\/li><\/ol>With respect to the first assignment, this\u00a0 court reiterates the doctrine that the necessity of a public instrument is not for the validity of\u00a0 the\u00a0 contract, but\u00a0 for its efficacy.\u00a0 The validity of the\u00a0 contract\u00a0 being admitted, the parties\u00a0 are entitled to exercise the\u00a0 proper action\u00a0 for\u00a0 the purpose of afterwards complying with this other formal requisite concerning the efficacy of the contract.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the second assignment of error, the appellants\u00a0 merely say\u00a0 that the\u00a0 said document No.\u00a0 1\u00a0 was executed after\u00a0 the\u00a0 death of the alleged seller, before an unqualified official, and that it was not duly identified.\u00a0\u00a0 As the question\u00a0 is made a\u00a0 supposition, and what was argued in the trial can not be said\u00a0 to\u00a0 be\u00a0 supposed, this court\u00a0 can not consider such assignment of error.<br\/><br\/>With respect to\u00a0 the\u00a0 third assignment,\u00a0 or the\u00a0 alleged falsity of the document referred\u00a0 to, the honorable judge <i>a quo<\/i> states this conclusion: \"The weight of\u00a0 the evidence is in favor of the opinion that Juliana Samonte, with\u00a0 the consent of her husband\u00a0 Felix Villanueva, sold\u00a0 to Alejandro Rojas that part of the\u00a0 fishery concerned.\u00a0 The testimony of Alejandro Rojas, Catalino Morelos,\u00a0 and Florencio Samonte sufficiently proves the authenticity of the instrument of sale, Exhibit No.\u00a0 1.\"\u00a0\u00a0 To oppose this opinion so expressed\u00a0 and powerfully reasoned\u00a0 in accordance\u00a0 with the rules of\u00a0 rational criticism, no conclusive arguments are advanced on which to found a contrary decision.\u00a0\u00a0 To note incoherencies and contradictions in the matter of details, without offering serious argument, can not lead\u00a0 to a different judgment than that formed by the judge <i>a quo.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The fourth and fifth assignments of error, which are the principal bases of the appeal,\u00a0 involve\u00a0 the\u00a0 real questions that this court must decide.<br\/><br\/>The appellants allege that half\u00a0 of the fishery\u00a0 was sold to two purchasers, Alejandro Rojas and his wife, and themselves;\u00a0 that none of the titles of either of the purchasers was inscribed in the registry of property; that, in accordance\u00a0 with article 1473 of the Civil Code,\u00a0 if one and the same thing were sold to different purchasers, and it were a real property, the ownership\u00a0 thereof would pertain to the acquirer who first had\u00a0 inscribed\u00a0 it in\u00a0 the\u00a0 land\u00a0 registry, and when not registered, to him who in good faith was first in\u00a0 possession of the same;\u00a0 that as\u00a0 they,\u00a0 the appellants, were\u00a0 the\u00a0 first in possession, the ownership of half of the fishery in question pertains to them.<br\/><br\/>But the trial\u00a0 judge, citing in support of his interpretation the renowned authors Manresa, in his commentaries on the Civil Code, and Morell, in his studies on the Mortgage Law,\u00a0 says the same as the first of these authors, to wit,\u00a0 that article 1473 has left unexpressed a concept that is understood, though not expressed, that is, the preexistence of the right\u00a0 in the transmitter.\u00a0\u00a0 And so he concludes in the following terms:<br\/><blockquote>\"Accepting the doctrine set forth and applying the same to the case at bar, it is evident that, if\u00a0 in fact a\u00a0 contract of sale was made between\u00a0 Juliana Samonte and Alejandro Rojas, the subsequent\u00a0 sale of the same property effected by the heirs of Juliana Samonte in favor of the petitioners must be null and void, inasmuch as the said heirs could not legally and validly transmit what at the time of the sale did not belong to them, and vice versa, if the said contract was not made,\u00a0 then the alleged defects\u00a0 warranting the nullity of the purchase and sale made\u00a0 between the petitioners and the heirs\u00a0 of Juliana Samonte, do not exist.\" (B. of E. 9.)<br\/><\/blockquote>The conclusion is established that the contract that was entered\u00a0 into\u00a0 by\u00a0 Juliana Samonte and\u00a0 Alejandro Rojas, Exhibit No. 1, is authentic.\u00a0 But this conclusion\u00a0 by itself is not sufficient to conclude on\u00a0 the\u00a0 other hand\u00a0 that the second sale effected by the heirs of Juliana Samonte in favor of the appellants, is null.<br\/><br\/>Facts proven which must be taken into consideration:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 The first sale was made by Juliana Samonte to Alejandro Rojas, on February 2,\u00a0 1900.<br\/><br\/>Second. Juliana Samonte\u00a0 died\u00a0 on March 10 of the same year.<br\/><br\/>Third. From March 21, 1895, to the same date of 1907, Mamerto Siaoson was\u00a0 entitled\u00a0 to the possession and lease of the fishery.<br\/><br\/>Fourth. For this reason, Juliana Samonte, on\u00a0 February 24, 1900, said that the lease still had six years to run.<br\/><br\/>Fifth.\u00a0 Juliana\u00a0 Samonte and Alejandro\u00a0 Rojas\u00a0 expressly stipulated, in the document of contract, Exhibit No. 1, that as soon as the said six years of\u00a0 the lease\u00a0 should have expired \"and this land is returned\u00a0 to us\u00a0 Juliana's words - immediately and without delay we will deliver the same to this married couple\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Rojas and\u00a0 his wife, Meneses).<br\/><br\/>Sixth.\u00a0 On November 14, 1907, the\u00a0 delivery of this land had not yet been made to Alejandro Rojas; hence, by means of a notarial proceeding, the latter demanded of two sons of Juliana Samonte, Brigido and Matias Villanueva, the said delivery.\u00a0 These are the terms of his demand:<br\/><blockquote>\"Whereas the said sale was on the\u00a0 <i>condition<\/i> that the fishery sold should not be delivered to the vendee until after the termination of the\u00a0 six years' encumbrance or lease that burdened the property at the time of the execution\u00a0 of the said contract of sale, and on the present date the said six years' lease having expired, therefore I,\u00a0 Alejandro Rojas, demand of the brothers Brigido and Matias, heirs of\u00a0 my vendors,\u00a0 their\u00a0 parents Dona Juliana Samonte\u00a0 and Don Felix Villanueva, that they deliver to me the fishery sold in my favor by their predecessors, and\u00a0 that, in accordance with the contract of purchase and sale, they give me possession of the said fishery with all the rights and actions pertaining thereto.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (Exhibit 7.)<br\/><\/blockquote>In view of these facts, it is\u00a0 evident that the sale made by Juliana\u00a0 Samonte to Alejandro Rojas\u00a0 in 1900\u00a0 remained in\u00a0 a state of dependency on the completion of the contract and\u00a0 was\u00a0 not consummated; for the consummation, as is known, consists in the delivery of the\u00a0 thing sold. Article 1462 of the Civil Code provides that - <br\/><blockquote>\"A thing sold shall be\u00a0 considered as delivered when it is placed in the hands of the vendee.<br\/><br\/>\"When the sale is made by means of a public instrument, the execution thereof shall be equivalent to the delivery of the thing which is\u00a0 the object of the contract, if in said instrument the\u00a0 contrary\u00a0 does not\u00a0 appear or may be clearly inferred.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>No actual delivery was made of the possession of\u00a0 the realty in\u00a0 question.\u00a0\u00a0 There was no public instrument,\u00a0 the execution of which could have constituted a form of delivery of\u00a0 the thing sold.\u00a0 On the contrary, from the\u00a0 instrument executed,\u00a0 which is\u00a0 only a private one, it clearly appears that the delivery of\u00a0 the fishery\u00a0 was postponed to a fixed date, to wit, that of the termination of the contract of lease then pending, which was to be six\u00a0 years from\u00a0 the date thereof.<br\/><blockquote>\"This form of delivery, says\u00a0 Manresa,\u00a0 is subject,\u00a0 however, with respect\u00a0 to its efficacy, to\u00a0 the\u00a0 terms of the\u00a0 instrument ; for,\u00a0 if from the latter it should appear, or can be deduced,\u00a0 that it\u00a0 was not the purpose of the contracting parties to effect the\u00a0 delivery, it could\u00a0 not be understood that the delivery had taken place.\u00a0 Such a case would arise, for example, when\u00a0 a fixed date was\u00a0 set when the vendee must take possession of the thing\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 (10 Civil Code, 122.)\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Alejandro Rojas himself\u00a0 expresses the\u00a0 purpose of the contracting parties.\u00a0\u00a0 He says:<br\/><blockquote>\" *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 the said sale was made on the condition that the fishery sold should not be delivered to the vendee until after the termination of the six years' lease of the property which\u00a0 was in operation at the time of the execution of the said contract of sale.\"<\/blockquote>Consequently,\u00a0 at the death of the vendor, Juliana Samonte, the fishery sold was a\u00a0 specific property bound\u00a0 by an\u00a0 obligation, but\u00a0 not delivered,\u00a0 and continued to form part of the mass of\u00a0 her\u00a0 property, subject to an eventual right unknown to her heirs,\u00a0 who were those upon whom it was incumbent, in 1907,\u00a0 to\u00a0 fulfill her obligation to make the delivery.<br\/><br\/>Her heirs, being entirely unaware of such an obligation, for in\u00a0 nowise could they have known that that fishery had been sold and was a\u00a0 thing owing and obligated to a third party, disposed of it by selling it to the petitioners.\u00a0\u00a0 In good faith, they possessed the\u00a0 fishery; in\u00a0 good faith, they sold it; and in good faith, the petitioners acquired it.<br\/><br\/>Against\u00a0 this sale so effected there is nothing that can\u00a0 be set\u00a0 up\u00a0 as a vice of the said contract.\u00a0\u00a0 The heirs of Juliana Samonte did not sell\u00a0 a thing, the fishery, which\u00a0 did not belong to them, for the ownership thereof had not yet been transmitted by Juliana Samonte, and they continued to hold it until it should be demanded of them and the transfer\u00a0 or tradition should be effected by them.<br\/><blockquote>\"Ownership and other property rights\u00a0 are acquired and transmitted by law, by gift,\u00a0 by testate or intestate succession, and, in consequence of certain contracts, by tradition.\" (Art. 609, Civil Code.)<br\/><\/blockquote>Such was the true legal condition of the fishery on the 10th of March, 1900, when Juliana Samonte\u00a0 died.\u00a0 Her heirs, having no\u00a0 knowledge of this obligation\u00a0 and\u00a0 making the\u00a0 fishery materially a part of the inheritance left by their mother, conveyed the property\u00a0 that had been\u00a0 held by her and which had been transferred to her successors in interest, without any complaint from a third party.\u00a0 And in fact, such was the status of the fishery; in proof of which, Felix Villanueva, the widower of Juliana Samonte,\u00a0 who appears as a signer of the instrument of\u00a0 sale executed by his wife in favor of Alejandro Rojas, took part in\u00a0 the sale of the fishery\u00a0 in the name of his minor\u00a0 children\u00a0 Natalia and Feliza, and solicited judicial authorization for the purpose.\u00a0\u00a0 And his children, the petitioners, saw\u00a0 all these acts performed by\u00a0 their father with\u00a0 respect\u00a0 to\u00a0 the property left as an inheritance by their mother, and there is not\u00a0 a word in the record opposing these acts of Felix Villanueva.<br\/><br\/>It must be concluded that the sales effected by the heirs of Juliana Samonte to the petitioners were true, valid, and efficacious.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, the judgment appealed from is reversed in so far as the first finding is concerned, and the Court of Land Registration\u00a0 shall declare\u00a0 the part of\u00a0 the fishery which\u00a0 belonged to the deceased Juliana Samonte to be the property of the petitioners and shall decree the adjudication\u00a0 and\u00a0 registration\u00a0 thereof\u00a0 in\u00a0 the name of\u00a0 the petitioners in the same manner\u00a0 as the other half of\u00a0 the fishery which it adjudged to them in the second finding.<br\/><br\/>No special finding is made as to the costs of\u00a0 this instance. So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson,<\/i>\u00a0 and <i> Moreland,\u00a0 JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><\/div>",

Mariano Alimurong, a nephew of the deceased, opposed the proceedings and requested that\u00a0 \"the\u00a0 will\u00a0 of the deceased, Dona\u00a0 Simplicia de\u00a0 los\u00a0 Santos, be declared null and void for either of the two reasons\" which\u00a0 he expresses,\u00a0 and which are:<br\/><blockquote>\"(1) Because the will was not executed and signed by the witnesses in accordance with the provisions\u00a0 of the\u00a0 Code of Civil Procedure now in force.<br\/><br\/>\"(2) Because it was executed under duress and undue and illegal influence on the part of the persons benefited thereby or of a person acting in their interests.\"<\/blockquote>The trial having\u00a0 been held and evidence adduced, the trial court declared the following facts to be proven:<br\/><blockquote>\"(1) That at 6 o'clock on the evening of June 17, 1907, Simplicia de los Santos, who was sick but in full\u00a0 possession of all her faculties, executed her will, which is the document attached to the record, Exhibit No. 1\u00a0 of the petitioner.<br\/><br\/>\"(2) That after the execution of such will\u00a0 on Monday, the testatrix died early on the morning of the following Wednesday.<br\/><br\/>\"(3) That,\u00a0 as a preliminary act,\u00a0 a rough\u00a0 copy of the said will was made up, which rough\u00a0 copy\u00a0 was read to the testatrix, and the latter ordered an additional clause to be added thereto, in connection with a legacy that she desired to make in favor of some of her old servants who\u00a0 had rendered good service.<br\/><br\/>\"(4)\u00a0 That, after the rough copy was amended by the addition of the above-mentioned clause, a clear copy thereof was made up and was again read\u00a0 to the\u00a0 testatrix, who approved it in all of its parts, and, as she was unable to sign, she requested Amando de Ocampo to sign for her and the latter wrote the following words\u00a0 with\u00a0 his\u00a0 own hand. 'At the\u00a0 request of the testatrix D,1 Simplicia de\u00a0 los Santos, I signed - Amando de Ocampo.'\u00a0 Immediately afterwards and also in the presence of the same testatrix and\u00a0 of each other, the witnesses Jose Juico, Gabino Panopio,\u00a0 Eusebio Dayao,\u00a0 Juan Angeles, Jose\u00a0 Torres, Alejo San Pedro,\u00a0 and Gregorio Sangil signed at the bottom of the\u00a0 will.<br\/><br\/>\"In view of the said facts\u00a0 the lower court concludes - the will executed by Simplicia de los Santos must be admitted to probate.\u00a0 The provisions of section 618 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions and Special Proceedings are fully complied with.\u00a0 The will bears the name\u00a0 of the\u00a0 testatrix written by Amando de Ocampo\u00a0 in her presence\u00a0 and by her express direction, and has been witnessed and signed by more than three trustworthy witnesses, in the presence of the testatrix and of each other.\"<\/blockquote>The judgment was as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is ordered\u00a0 that Exhibit No.\u00a0 1,\u00a0 duly translated, be probated as. the last will of Simplicia de los Santos and that the corresponding letters of administration be issued in favor of Gregorio Macapinlac, the surviving\u00a0 husband of the said Simplicia de los Santos, the protest of the adverse party being dismissed, with the costs.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The opponent appealed, and the appeal having been submitted to this court, together with the allegations of both parties, it appears that the appellant has alleged\u00a0 the following assignments of error:<br\/><ol><li>That the proceedings were not dismissed, because the witnesses\u00a0 for the petitioner did not sign their respective testimony.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That it was declared that the will of the deceased Simplicia de los Santos was executed with all legal formalities.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That it was not declared that the will of the deceased Simplicia de los Santos was executed under undue and illegal influence on the part of the persons benefited thereby or of a person acting in their interests.<\/li><\/ol>With reference to the first assignment of error, inasmuch as no question was raised in the first instance in the form of a\u00a0 motion and denied by the\u00a0 court below and\u00a0 exception taken and brought\u00a0 up on appeal, there\u00a0 is no ground on which we may take into consideration such assignment and decide a matter not covered by\u00a0 the appeal and with reference to which a decision by this court is not properly sought.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 regard to the second assignment, in view of the facts set forth and of the findings made by the trial court,\u00a0 according to the preponderance of the evidence, it can not be rationally shown that the conclusion should have been otherwise,\u00a0 nor does it appear that the conclusion infringes any statute or legal doctrine for the\u00a0 enforcement of which this court should review the evidence.<br\/><br\/>But, besides the question of fact,\u00a0 the\u00a0 appellant submits another question of\u00a0 law, viz, whether\u00a0 or\u00a0 not the will was signed in accordance with\u00a0 the law, and\u00a0 he affirms that it was not, inasmuch as the law requires that when a person signs\u00a0 in place of the testator he should write the name of the latter in the will as\u00a0 the signature; this was\u00a0 not done by Amando de Ocampo in the will in question, as he did not sign it with the name of the testatrix.<br\/><br\/>It is\u00a0 shown by the evidence\u00a0 that the\u00a0 will was wholly written in the handwriting of the subscribing witness, Gregorio\u00a0 Sangil, and at the foot thereof the following words appear in a new paragraph and sufficiently apart:<br\/><blockquote>\"At the\u00a0 request of\u00a0 the testatrix,\u00a0 Da.\u00a0 Simplicia de los Santos, I signed.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \"For\u00a0 Simplicia de los Santos.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \"Amando de Ocampo.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 <br\/><\/div><\/blockquote>As a question of fact, the authenticity of the words \"For Simplicia de ]os Santos,\" prefixed to the signature, is impugned as not having been written\u00a0 at the time of the\u00a0 execution of the will.<br\/><br\/>And, as a question of law, it is claimed that the form of signing for the testatrix \"At the request of the testatrix Da. Simplicia de los Santos, I signed: Amando de Ocampo,\" is not in\u00a0 accordance with the requirements of the law.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the first question,\u00a0 the\u00a0 trial\u00a0 court concluded that \"the\u00a0 posterior insertion of the words 'For Simplicia\u00a0 de los Santos' can not affect the validity of the will.\"<br\/><br\/>Therefore, it can be considered as nonexistent, and the other as the only form of signature by the testatrix, the authenticity of which has not been impugned or which the trial court admits as conclusive, and is the only one taken into\u00a0 account in its\u00a0 findings of\u00a0 fact.\u00a0 Although the said words \"For Simplicia de los Santos\" be considered as\u00a0 inserted subsequently,\u00a0 which\u00a0 we\u00a0 neither affirm nor deny, because a specific determination either way is unnecessary, in our opinion the signature for the testatrix\u00a0 placed outside of the body of the will contains the name of the testatrix as if she signed the will, and also\u00a0 the signature of the witness who, at her request, wrote the name of the testatrix and signed for\u00a0 her, affirming the truth of this fact, attested by the other witnesses then present.\u00a0 And this fully complies with the provisions\u00a0 of section 618 of the Act.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the third assignment of error, the court below found:<br\/><blockquote>\" *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 and the influence\u00a0 which,\u00a0 according\u00a0 to the adverse party,\u00a0 was exercised upon the testatrix by Father Lupo is not shown.\u00a0 While the rough copy of the will was being made, Father Lupo simply discussed with those who were making the rough draft the question of the more appropriate\u00a0 use of some phrases in <i>Pampango.<\/i>\u00a0\u00a0 It is true that he went in\u00a0 and out of the room of the testatrix several times, and that from time to time he showed\u00a0 a relic to her, but there\u00a0 is no evidence to indicate\u00a0 that Father Lupo influenced the testatrix\u00a0 directly and\u00a0 caused her\u00a0 to\u00a0 be influenced in any way.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>Against this finding of fact, based upon the preponderance of the evidence as weighed by the trial court, we find no reason or ground for deciding this question of fact in any other way.\u00a0 We find no data showing that the person above\u00a0 mentioned directly influenced the provisions of\u00a0 the will; that such is the illegal and improper influence which the law condemns as overcoming that freedom\u00a0 by\u00a0 which the last will of a man must be expressed.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed\u00a0 from\u00a0 is hereby\u00a0 affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/i>\u00a0 and <i>Moreland, JJ.,<\/i>\u00a0 concur.<br\/><\/div>",
