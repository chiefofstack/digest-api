THE CITY OF MANILA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the city \nof Manila in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the sum of \nP1,649.82, with interest and costs.\n<p>It appears from the record that in 1901 Pastor Lerma, who was at that time \nthe owner of a piece of land situated in the city of Manila, declared the same \nfor taxation, alleging its area to be 337,938.50 square meters, when, in truth \nand in fact, it was 480,695.53 square meters. By reason of this inaccurate \ndeclaration 142,767.03 square meters escaped the payment of taxes from 1901 to \n1910, in which year the taxes which would have been paid upon said 142,767.03 \nsquare meters, if properly declared, were assessed for the years from 1901 to \n1910 against the plaintiff, who was at that time the owner of said lands.<\/p>\n<p>It further appears that, at the time the plaintiff bought the land in \nquestion from Lerma, in 1907, it was registered under the Torrens system and \nthat the plaintiff, in purchasing said land, received a certificate of title \nthereto in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 496.<\/p>\n<p>The city, on the assessment of the taxes for the said years against the \nplaintiff, proceeded by distraint against the property for the collection of the \nsame,, whereupon the plaintiff, to avoid litigation, trouble and expense, paid \ntaxes, fees and interest in the sum of P2,096.49, under protest, and thereafter \nbegan this action to recover the same.<\/p>\n<p>The learned trial court found in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of \nP1,649.82 and costs, and the defendant city appealed from that judgment.<\/p>\n<p>A demurrer was interposed to the complaint in the Court of First Instance and \nsustained. Upon the request of plaintiff the court entered final judgment \ndismissing the complaint and the plaintiff appealed to this court therefrom. \nUpon that appeal this court held that the complaint stated facts sufficient to \nconstitute a cause of action and remanded the cause for proceedings in \naccordance with law. Thereupon the defendant duly answered, the parties \nstipulated the facts, and the court, in view of the decision of the Supreme \nCourt as to the sufficiency of the facts stated in the complaint, rendered \njudgment in favor of the plaintiff as hereinabove stated.<\/p>\n<p>The only question presented on this appeal is whether or not a purchaser for \nvalue and in good faith of land registered under Act No. 496, which has escaped \ntaxation by reason of the failure of the prior owner to declare it for taxation \nas required by law, takes such land free and clear from the burden of such \ntaxes, they never having been, prior to the purchase, actually levied or \nassessed against the land by reason of said failure of the prior owner to \ndeclare it for taxation.<\/p>\n<p>The determination of that question depends on the wording of section 39 of \nAct No. 496, as amended by Act No. 2011. That section reads, so far as material, \nas follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Every applicant receiving a certificate of title in pursuance of a decree of \nregistration, and every subsequent purchaser of registered land who takes a \ncertificate of title for value in good faith shall hold the same free of all \nincumbrances except those noted on said certificate, and any of the following \nincumbrances which may be subsisting, namely:<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p align=\"center\">*******<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Second. Taxes within two years after the same have become due and \npayable.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There is no claim on the part of the plaintiff that the taxes in question \nhere were illegally or erroneously assessed or levied or that the additional \narea of 142,767.03 square meters was illegally or erroneously listed and \nincluded in the tax rolls of the city. Nor does he question either the authority \nof the city assessor and collector in listing said area for taxation and in \nassessing all the taxes due or the validity of the assessment itself or of any \nof the steps leading up to such assessment. His action is based solely on the \nproposition that, under section 39 above quoted, his land \"cannot be incumbered \nwith the land tax except those corresponding to the years\" during which he has \nheld it.<\/p>\n<p>As to the appellant's contention, perhaps it is best to let it state it in \nits own words:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The appellant contends that the taxes which appellee seeks to recover were \nnot 'due and payable\u2019 until 1910 when the area of 142,767.03 square meters was \nfor the first time listed and valued for taxation and taxes assessed against him \nas owner.<\/p>\n<p>\"The sum sought to be recovered represents the back taxes which were assessed \nand levied in 1910 on the area in question which had escaped taxation in the \nprevious years, and were charged against plaintiff in pursuance of section 50 of \nAct No. 183 * * *.<\/p>\n<p>\"In compliance with the duty thus imposed upon him by the provisions of the \nlaw above quoted, the city assessor and collector, upon discovery that said area \nof 142,767.03 square meters of plaintiff's land had escaped taxation, proceeded \nto list the same in his tax rolls and assessed and levied the taxes in \nquestion.<\/p>\n<p>\"Act No. 183 provides for a per centum tax on the assessed value of the real \nestate in the city of Manila. The tax being based on the assessed value of the \nrealty, the proportion to be collected from any individual taxpayer is not \nknown, nor can it be ascertained unless the valuation and assessment of the \nproperty is first made. For this very reason said Act * * * establishes as a \nprerequisite that the real estate in the city of Manila shall be assessed and \nvalued for taxation by the city assessor and collector,\u2019 and charges said \nofficer with the duty of listing all taxable property in the city. It is \nobvious, therefore, that there can be no taxes due and payable unless the \nassessment and valuation of the property to be taxed is first made, for, \notherwise, the amount of the tax cannot be ascertained.<\/p>\n<p>\"* * * Now, it is difficult to surmise what method of reasoning has led \nplaintiff to the conclusion that such provision of the Land Registration Act is \napplicable to the case at bar. The complaint specifically alleges that the back \ntaxes in question were not assessed and levied until 1910, years after the \ntransfer of the area in question to the plaintiff. Taxes were paid in 1911 or \none year after they were assessed and levied. Assuming that an owner's \ncertificate was issued to plaintiff in 1907, section 39 of Act No. 496 is \nclearly inapplicable for there were no taxes 'due and payable' then on the area \nin question. This area was listed and valued and the taxes were assessed and \nlevied after the issuance of his certificate, not before. Assessment is the \nlisting and valuation of property liable to taxation. (Adam <em>vs.<\/em> \nTonella, 70 Miss., 701; 22 L. R; A., 349.) 'With out an assessment there is no \ndebt from the taxpayer, and there is no obligation on his part which can be \nenforced in an action.' (Galusha <em>vs.<\/em> Wendt, 114 Iowa, 604.) It is the \nbasis of the levy, and without it there cannot properly be a levy. (Worthington \n<em>vs.<\/em> Withman, 70 Iowa, 192.)\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the appellant has misunderstood the purpose of Act \nNo. 496. If a statute needs interpretation or construction, the influence most \ndominant in that process is the purpose or intent of the Act. We have held (City \nof Manila <em>vs.<\/em> Lack, 19 Phil. Rep., 324) that the general purpose of the \nLand Registration Act (No. 496) was to create an indefeasible title and one free \nfrom all charges, liens and incumbrances except those preserved against it by \nspecial mention in the decree of registration or by provision of law. Section 39 \nof that Act embodies that purpose in express law. It declares, in effect, that \nevery owner of registered land shall hold the same free and clear from any and \nall liens and incumbrances except those set forth in the decree of registration \nand those mentioned and excepted in that section. To repeat, the purpose was to \ngive to the person registering, and to his transferee for value, an absolutely \nclean title, one not subject to hidden defects, to undeveloped or inchoate \nclaims, to any sort of restriction, limitation or reduction except those named \nin the certificate of registration or described in section 39.<\/p>\n<p>This being the purpose of the statute, the exceptions named in section 39 \nwill not be enlarged beyond the actual signification of the words used or \nextended beyond the limits which the words themselves actually set. Reading that \nsection in the light of this purpose, we see, from the second paragraph thereof, \nthat the only taxes to which property held under a Torrens title is subject in \nthe hands of the person who obtained the original registration, or of an \ninnocent purchaser for value, are those \"within two years after the same have \nbecome due and payable.\" From this section, it is clear that, before land just \nregistered or transferred for value after registration can be subjected to \npayment of past taxes, three things are requisite: First, they must be taxes; \nsecond, they must be due and payable and subsisting as liens; and, third, they \nmust be due and payable within two years of the time when the land was \noriginally registered or when the transfer was made to the purchaser for \nvalue.<\/p>\n<p>We pass over the question which might be raised as to whether the assessment \nin question, made in the year 1910, was really taxes in 1907, the year in which \nthe plaintiff purchased the land, and take up, first, the second requisite, \nwhich is that the taxes be due and payable and subsisting as charges on the \nland. Clear it is that, under this section, taxes not due and payable are not \nincluded among the subsisting liens and incumbrances to which land in the \ncondition described is subject; and, if the assessment in question, made for the \nfirst time in 1910, can be said to have been taxes in 1907, it certainly was \nnot, under the tax laws, \"taxes due and payable.\" Under the tax laws taxes are \nnot due and payable until they have been levied or assessed as provided by law. \nIn 1907, therefore, the taxes now sought to be collected were not due and \npayable, as they had not then been levied or assessed on the property. As to \nthis requisite then, the taxes in question do not fall within its definition or \nterms. Reverting to the third requisite, it is clear that the taxes in question, \nnot being due and payable until 1910, the year in which they were assessed for \nthe first time, they were not taxes due and payable within two years prior to \nthe time when the transfer to the plaintiff was made. Taxes due and payable for \nthe first time in 1910 could not have been due and payable two years prior to \n1907, the year in which the plaintiff purchased the land, nor could they have \nbeen subsisting as liens or incumbrances at that time.<\/p>\n<p>It is, therefore, evident that the taxes in question do not fulfill, with the \npossible exception of the first, any one of the requisites necessary to bring1 \nthem within the second paragraph of section 39. <br\/><br\/>A further argument in \nfavor of our position might be based upon the fact that, if it was the intention \nof the law to relieve registered land under certain conditions from taxes which \nare subsisting liens and incumbrances thereon, and this, of course, is the fact, \nsince, under section 39, all taxes, although duly levied and assessed and, \ntherefore, subsisting liens and incumbrances prior to registration or the sale, \nare prevented from having any force or effect on the land so registered or sold, \nit is evident that so-called taxes which have not been assessed or levied \nagainst the property and are simply inchoate and undeveloped, in other words, \ntaxes in embryo, cannot be held to be a lien or incumbrance upon the land so \nregistered or conveyed or to affect the title thereto. If it was the intention \nof the law to wipe out actual liens and incumbrances, is it logical to contend \nthat it was also the intention to preserve, with the force of liens and \nincumbrances, inchoate taxes, or taxes in embryo, which, as a matter of law, are \nnot liens or incumbrances in any sense of the word ? It seems to us that the \ngreater must include the less. If a measure contains ten gallons it also \ncontains five; and, if a statute relieves land from taxes which are actual liens \nand incumbrances, it must be held to have been the intention to relieve it from \nthose which are not only not liens and incumbrances but are not even in \nexistence. It is the protection of the purchaser which is the dominant note of \nthe statute; and, if such taxes as those here in question may be collected, then \nthe value of that title has been reduced, its efficacy impaired, and one of the \nmain purposes of the Land Registration Act defeated; for taxes which have never \nbeen levied or assessed are far more dangerous to a purchaser than taxes \nactually assessed and of record, because they are wholly unknown and \nunascertainable.<\/p>\n<p>We see no foundation for the contention of the appellant that this \nconstruction of the statute repeals section 50 of Act No. 183. It is true that \nthe provisions may at times, in a way, come in conflict with each other. But \nthat is due to the provisions themselves and not to our construction of them. \nSection 50 authorizes the city assessor and collector to list, value and charge \nagainst the owner of lands which have theretofore escaped taxation the taxes due \nfor the current year and for all other years for which they had not been \nassessed. This provision is general. Section 39 puts a limitation on it. It \ndeclares that, although taxes may be assessed as provided in section 50, they \ncannot be so assessed to the extent of impairing the virtues of a Torrens title \nas it is obtained by registration or by a purchaser for value. After section 50 \nhas fully operated, section 39 determines whether the taxes assessed under that \nsection will be collectible out of lands held under registered title. Section 50 \ndeals with the levy and assessment of taxes; section 39 with the conditions \nunder which certain lands shall be exempt from the payment of taxes. By their \nvery nature these sections will at times be in open conflict. In such case the \ntax must give way to the title\u2014the general provision to the exception.<\/p>\n<p>Nor do we see any strength in the contention that our construction of section \n39 discriminates against unregistered property. In this connection the appellant \nsays:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The per centum tax provided by that Act (No. 183) is not distributed per \ncapita or apportioned between individuals, but is assessed directly against the \nproperty. It is repugnant to reason to assume that the Philippine Commission, \nwhile it sought to secure this uniformity of taxation by enacting said section \n50 of Act No. 183, intended immediately after to defeat that object by creating \nan exemption in favor of registered lands that have escaped taxation. This in \nitself would amount to a discrimination against lands not registered, a thing \nwhich is contrary to the principles of taxation.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The defect in this reasoning is that it assumes that the Philippine \nCommission did not intend to do with unassessed taxes what appellant admits it \nactually did with respect to taxes actually assessed and due and payable and \nexisting as liens on the property. Is it a violent conclusion to assume that the \nPhilippine Commission did not intend to incumber registered lands with \nunassessed taxes in the face of the proposition that it actually relieved such \nlands from taxes actually assessed and existing as liens thereon? No one denies \nthat the Philippine Commission made certain declarations in favor of registered \nlands which it did not make, and did not intend to make, in favor of lands not \nregistered. In fact, as we have already stated, the whole purpose of Act No. 496 \nis to make registered lands different from unregistered lands and to give them \nadvantages very much superior to the latter. Moreover, appellant overlooks the \npurpose of Act No. 496, namely, the creation of an indefeasible title not only \nin the hands of him who registers it but also in the hands of the person to whom \nhe transfers it for value. The accomplishment of this purpose required certain \nconcessions in favor of that title and corresponding limitations of the rights \nof others. It is impossible to make the rights of a holder of a Torrens title \naltogether superior without, at the same time, making the rights of others in \nthe same premises inferior. There is no discrimination in section 39 against \nunregistered property. There is simply a protection of registered titles. The \nfact that unregistered titles are in many ways seriously defective furnishes no \nreason why the Legislature should not create a title that is not defective. When \nthe intention of the Legislature in passing' Act No. 496 is kept clearly in \nmind, it is not at all strange that the Legislature subordinated the right of \nthe Government to collect taxes in certain cases to the creation of an \nindefeasible and unimpeachable title and in furtherance of that intention \ndeclared that it was better that the Government lose a tax <em>occasionally<\/em> \nthan that registered titles should be uncertain <em>always.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The contention is equally without merit that our construction of section 39 \nmakes that section repugnant to section 70 of the same Act. As we said in \ndiscussing section 50, there will be at times open conflict between the two \nsections, but that is not due to construction but arises, rather, out of the \nsubject matter with which the two sections deal. Section 70 provides that after \nlands are registered they shall then \"in all respects be subject to the same \nburdens and incidents attached by law to unregistered lands;\" and that \"nothing \ncontained in this Act shall in any way be construed to relieve registered land \nor the owners thereof from * * * liability to any lien of any description \nestablished by law on the land and the buildings thereon * * * or to relieve \nsuch land from liability to be appropriated in any lawful manner for the payment \nof debts, or to change or affect in any other way any other rights or \nliabilities created by law and applicable to unregistered land, except as \notherwise expressly provided in this Act or in the amendments hereof.\" When \nregistered they become subject, as the section says, to all of the incidents to \nwhich unregistered lands are subject. In discussing this section, as in \ndiscussing section 50, distinction must always be made between lands which were \nregistered after the taxes sought to be collected were assessed or might have \nbeen assessed, or, having been registered, were transferred to a purchaser for \nvalue after the taxes were assessed or might have been assessed. It must be \nremembered that the purpose of Act No. 496 was to create and preserve an \nunimpeachable title. A perfect title is obtained by the act of registration and, \nin order to keep that title perfect, it is cleaned anew with every subsequent \ntransfer for value. One of the main requisites of a perfect title is that it can \nbe transferred and received fearlessly; and to the maintenance of this quality \nthe Legislature, with certain limitations, has subordinated every other \nconsideration, including the interests of the Government itself. The result of \nthe theory on which we are deciding this case is not to relieve registered lands \nfrom taxation or from any other of the burdens imposed by section 70, but to \ndeclare that the Government cannot hide its claims or fail to present them for \nany considerable length of time and thereby pile them up against the lands in \nsuch manner as to destroy or impair the quality of free and fearless transfer \nwithout which the Registration Act fails of one of its most important purposes. \nAs already stated, it is no doubt true that occasions will arise when sections \n39 and 70 of Act No. 496 will be in apparent conflict. In such cases the general \nprovisions of section 70 must give way to the exceptions of section 39. While \nsuch a condition may lead one who is not a careful observer to the conclusion \nthat there is a repugnancy between the two sections, that is not the fact in \nreality. Section 39 forms an exception to the general provisions of the Act and \nparticularly of section 70. Where an Act contains an exception, the exception is \nas much a part of the Act as the general provisions to which it presents the \nexception; and when the occasion for the application of the exception arises it \ncannot really be said that there is repugnancy between the general provisions \nand the exception.<\/p>\n<p>From what has been said it is clear that section 50 of Act No. 183 and \nsection 70 of Act No. 496 are both applicable to registered land. In order to \navoid confusion it is necessary, as we have already remarked more than once, to \ndistinguish between the case where the registered lands were owned by the person \nagainst whom the taxes are assessed for the period during which they are \nassessed, and the case where the lands have been transferred by him to an \ninnocent purchaser for value. So long as the registered lands are owned by A, \nthey are subject to the provisions of section 50 as well as section 70. If A has \nmisrepresented to the tax authorities the area of his land and declared it for \nless than its real extension, then section 50 can be invoked to oblige him to \npay the taxes on the excess area. But if, after having incorrectly declared said \nlands and after having had his taxes assessed in accordance with his false \ndeclaration, thereby escaping taxation on a portion of the land, he transfers \nthe lands to B, who buys them for value, then section 50 cannot be invoked as to \nthe portion which thus escaped taxation, because of certain provisions of Act \nNo. 496 (sec. 39) which declare that an innocent purchaser for value shall take \nthe lands free from all liens and incumbrances except those specifically named \nin section 39. Thus, the plaintiff being the owner of the lands at this moment \nand having been the owner since 1907, the year of his purchase, he is liable for \nall the taxes levied and assessed, or which might have been levied or assessed, \nupon said lands since that time; and if it appears that, during the time from \n1907 to date, he has misstated the area of the land in his declaration for \ntaxation, such area can be corrected under section 50 and he be made to pay the \ntaxes which he should have paid. But if, to-day, he transfers that land to a \npurchaser for value, the purchaser is not responsible for the taxes on the \nexcess area, nor can the land be subjected in his hands to the payment of such \ntaxes. It seems to us clear that the confusion into which the appellant has \nfallen would have been avoided if it had made the distinction between lands in \nthe hands of the person who owned them at the time the taxes became due, or \nduring the period covered by the false declaration, and those in the hands of a \npurchaser for value to whom that person transfers such lands.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff is liable for all taxes and assessments which were levied or \nassessed, or which might have been levied or assessed, during his ownership of \nthe lands. It appears that he realized that he was so liable and has paid the \ntaxes for the years 1907 to 1910. He claims only the right to recover for the \ntaxes paid for the years previous to the date of his purchase; and those taxes \nnot having been either due or payable and not having even been assessed or \nlevied prior to the time when he purchased the land, his contention is well \nfounded.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C, J., Torres<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><em>Carson <\/em>and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> dissent.<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/div>",

Veloria has set up the same defense, presenting an instrument of \nsale in which it is set forth that on April21, 1911, he sold the land on which \nhe is made to owe land tax on May 4,1912. Pedro Palillo, the vendee, testified \nthat he had made the purchase from Veloria and paid the taxes. (Exhibits 3 and \n4.)<\/p>\n<p>Florentino Buquingo also sets up the same defense\u2014that is, that he had sold \nthe land on which he is made to owe land tax on May 4, 1912. (Exhibit 1.)<\/p>\n<p>The municipal treasurer of Agusan, Butuan, certified that Pedro Rosales, \ndelinquent in payment of his tax for the year 1911, paid it on June 29, 1912 \n(Exhibit E); that Feliciano C. Veloria in the same condition paid it on June 6, \n1912 (Exhibit F); and that Florentino Buquingo in the same condition paid it on \nJune 13, 1912 (Exhibit H). The fact then is that May, 1912, the last month for \npaying, passed without any of the defendants' having done so.<\/p>\n<p>It is alleged that it is necessary that the false statement was \n<em>knowingly<\/em> made in the oath; but it has already been decided that such \nis the presumption unless there is evidence to the contrary, under the \npresumption that every voluntary act implies. (17 Phil. Rep., 303.)<\/p>\n<p>The judgment is affirmed, with the costs of this instance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson, Moreland, Trent,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> \nconcur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

On the 8th day of July, \n1913, the prosecuting attorney of the Province of Cebu presented a complaint in \nthe court of the justice of the peace of the municipality of Cebu. On the same \nday a warrant for the arrest of the defendant was issued. On the same day the \ndefendant was detained and was admitted to bail upon a bond in the sum of \nP5,000. \n<p>On the 21st day of August, 1913, the prosecuting attorney of the Province of \nCebu presented a complaint in the Court of First Instance of said province, \ncharging the defendant with the crime of robbery. The complaint alleged;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That in or about the last part of the month of June, 1913, within the \nmunicipality of Cebu of this province and judicial district the said accused \nAlejandro Albao did, willfully, maliciously, and criminally, and with intent of \ngain, through violence and intimidation upon the person of Vicente Lizarraga of \nthe municipality of Cebu, seize a quantity of opium worth P14,000 belonging to \nthe said Vicente Lizarraga; in violation of law.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Upon said complaint the defendant was duly arrested, and pleaded not guilty, \nwas tried, found guilty of the crime of robbery, and was sentenced to be \nimprisoned for a period of ten years of <em>presidio mayor,<\/em> and to pay the \ncosts, in accordance with the provisions of article 502, in relation with \nparagraph 5 of article 503 of the Penal Code. From that sentence the defendant \nappealed to this court and made the following assignments of error:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I. The court erred in holding that, on June 25, 1913, \u2018Vicente Lizarraga was \nthe unlawful possessor of 202 tins of opium, which then had a value of about \nP14,000.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>\"II. The court erred in holding that, on the same night of June 25, 'Vicente \nLizarraga took the 202 tins of opium to the house of Francisco Jurado in \naccordance with the agreement' (with Ciriaco Singson and Anatalio Alviola).<\/p>\n<p>\"III. The court erred in holding that 'Albao, on the night of .the crime (the \naforesaid 25th of June), did, through threats, intimidation, and violence \nagainst the person of Vicente Lizarraga,' seize the 202 tins of opium, and \nappropriate them to himself afterwards, instead of delivering the opium to the \nauthorities.<\/p>\n<p>\"IV. The court erred in rendering a judgment of conviction against Alejandro \nAlbao, instead of acquitting him.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>With reference to the first assignment of error, the lower court found: \"On \nand before June 25, 1913, Vicente Lizarraga was the unlawful possessor of 202 \ntins of opium, which then had a value of about P14,000. Testifying as a witness, \nhe stated that he found them by accident on the shore of Mabolo, a suburb of the \nmunicipality of Cebu, which statement, it is needless to say, is a falsehood. \nNeither was he the owner of the said tins of opium, but rather simply an agent \nfor their sale in representation of the owners, whose names he abstained from \nrevealing.and they are not indicated by other evidence.\"<\/p>\n<p>From an examination of the record, we find that the following witnesses \ndeclared during the trial as follows, relating to the facts charged in the \ncomplaint:<\/p>\n<p>First. Vicente Lizarraga, who testified, in part, as follows: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. Where were you about the latter part of June of the present year?\u2014A. On \nthe night of the 25th I was in Calle Legaspi, in the house of a man named \nJurado. I went there with 202 tins of opium to sell them to Ciriaco Singson. \nAfter the tins had been counted and placed in a valise, Alejandro Albao \nappeared, accompanied by three others. Alejandro Albao, pointing his revolver at \nme, told me not to move and commanded me to halt before the police,<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Did you know his companions?\u2014A. No, sir; but if I saw the one who carried \nthe palasan, I could identify him.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Where are the tins of opium now?\u2014A. I do not know, because Alejandro \nAlbao and his companions took them away with them.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Did you see them take the tins away?\u2014A. Yes, sir; for I went out of the \nhouse after they did; they went out first, for Alejandro Albao told me that they \nwere going to leave first with the tins.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Describe what happened.\u2014A. Ciriaco Singson, Anatalio Alviola, and I were \nsquatted on the floor and engaged in counting the tins and seeing whether or not \nthey were genuine, for Singson said that he knew them from the way they were \nsoldered. We had already counted all the tins, which numbered 202. I separated \nfrom the rest four of them that were crushed. While I was replacing them in the \nsame valise in which I had brought them, we heard someone on the stair say in \nVisayan 'Good evening,' and Alejandro Albao entered and pointed his revolver at \nme. The first thing he said was 'Halt before the police. Let no one move.'<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. How many were they?\u2014A. Four, with Alejandro Albao. Albao pointed his \nrevolver at me. One of the men who entered had a cane. Albao then asked me to \nwhom those tins belonged! I answered that they were mine. Then he asked me \nwhether they were genuine. I replied to him: 'I think that they are genuine.' \nJust then while he was there talking, the owner of the house and another man \nwhom I was unable to identify came out.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Who was the owner of the house?\u2014A. Francisco Jurado. Then Albao asked for \na penknife to open a tin and Francisco Jurado fetched a pair of scissors. They \nopened the tin and then Albao said that that was not very good opium, and they \nplugged up the hole with paper and Francisco Jurado put the tin under a table. \nThen Ciriaco Singson said to the policeman that it would be better to arrange \nthe matter amicably, and then I also supported that proposal, saying that it \nwould be better to arrange the matter amicably. After we had been talking a \nlittle while Ciriaco Singson disappeared through a back door. When Albao \ninquired where Singson was, the owner of the house said that he had already \nleft. Then Anatalio Alviola and I made an agreement with the policemen that we \nwould pay P6,000 to each of them, as a bribe, in order that they might release \nus.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Who is this man Anatalio?\u2014A. I found him there with Ciriaco Singson. I \ndid not know him until that moment. I told him that I had no money with which to \nguarantee the P6,000, and Anatalio Alviola said to me that it did not matter, \nthat he would get the tins and would pay the P6,000 to the policemen. Then they \ncame to an agreement, for he said there were two more men waiting below, that \nP1,000 should be paid to each one of the policemen. Then Albao said to us that \nthey were going to take away the tins, for I had said to him that I would take \nthem with me, as, without those tins, I would have no money with which to pay. \nThey told me that I should not do so, for, if I did, I would be caught again \nimmediately by other policemen and I would not know where to take the tins. Then \nhe told me to wait there a while, that they were going to go down. After a \nlittle while Anatalio Alviola and I went down and did not find anybody in the \nstreet. I went with Anatalio Alviola and he showed me his store and from there I \nwent home.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. How long since had it been that you had had an understanding with Singson \nin regard to that opium deal?\u2014A. On the 23d, in the morning, I spoke to Alburo \nin regard to his finding a purchaser.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Which Alburo?\u2014A. Isabelo Alburo. Then he took me with him at about 12 \no'clock. He took me to the house of Graciano del Mar, on Calle Martinez, and \nGraciano del Mar told me that he was going to call Ciriaco Singson in order that \nthe latter might have an understanding with me. We made an appointment to meet \nat Mr. Alburo's house at half past 12, after dinner. Then Isabelo Alburo and I \nwent to his house for dinner. Immediately after dinner Ciriaco Singson came, \naccompanied by Graciano del Mar, and asked me how many tins I had and whether, \nhe might take as a sample one opened tin and one closed. I took my bicycle, came \nto Cebu, got two tins and showed them to him. He told me, for I had asked of him \nP75 for each tin, that he was willing to pay P68. I refused this offer and said \nthat my lowest price was P70. He then replied to me that he was going to look \nfor money; whereupon I left. On the following day Isabelo Alburo came to the \nstore where I was employed and told me that they were looking for money, that he \ncould do nothing. On the morning of the 25th Alburo told me to go to the Plaza \nde la Independencia, at 6 o'clock, the time of vespers, to confer with Ciriaco \nSingson, for they now had money. At about half past 6 o'clock I went to the \nPlaza de la Independencia and met Isabelo Alburo, who told me that Ciriaco \nSingson had already been there and that it had been arranged that I should meet \nhim at 8 o'clock sharp in the Merchant Caf6 for the purpose of designating a \nplace where the sale was to be made. At 8 o'clock sharp I was in the Merchant \nCafe, drinking a lemonade. Five minutes afterwards Ciriaco Singson entered and \nafter he too had drunk a lemonade we left. We walked along until we came in \nfront of the government building where we took a vehicle and went to Calle \nLogarta and there paid for the vehicle. In Calle Zulueta he showed me a \nwarehouse and told me that the sale could be effected there, but that another \nhouse he was going to show me was safer. We then went to Calle Zulueta and he \npointed out his house to me: 'That is my house; we also could make the sale \nthere, but I am very closely watched\/ We even went to Calle Legaspi and there in \nCalle Legaspi he told me that that was a good place, that I could take the tins \nthere. I told him to wait for me there. I went home to get the tins and took \nthem to him in the said house on Calle Legaspi.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. What time was it when you arrived there with the tins ?\u2014A. A quarter to \n9.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Does a batch of 202 tins of opium weigh much?\u2014A. Yes, sir; they were so \nheavy that I had to be helped up the stairs between Anatalio Alviola and Ciriaco \nSingson.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Since when was Anatalio Alviola concerned in this matter?\u2014A. Right there \nin Calle Legaspi, in the house of Francisco Jurado. Upon my asking him who he \nwas, he told me that he was another one of the purchasers; that he could not pay \nfor all the opium; that he brought Alviola so that the latter might buy what he \ncould not, and that Alviola carried money.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. What price did you people agree should be paid for your opium?\u2014A. P70 a \ntin.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Do you really know now whether or not the opium is in the possession of \nthe Government?\u2014A. No, sir; it is not in the possession of the Government.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Was it all opium?\u2014A. Yes, sir; all of it.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Do you know whether or not Albao was a municipal policeman in Cebu ?\u2014A. \nYes, sir; because afterwards upon my identifying him I had an inquiry made at \nthe municipal building and they told me that until the 28th.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. How long have you known Ciriaco Singson?<\/p>\n<p>\"The Court. We are talking about whether or not he was a policeman. On the \nnight of the crime, was he wearing a uniform like that worn by policeman or \nagents of the authorities?\u2014A. No, sir; but he carried a regulation revolver.<\/p>\n<p>\"The Court. Was he wearing a badge?\u2014A. No, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Will you please explain to the court why you gave the opium to Albao; why \nyou did not wish to keep the opium?\u2014A. Because he said to me that if I took the \ntins with me I would not know where to put them, that they would catch me again. \nAnatalio Alviola told me, besides, that on the following day he would get them \nback by the payment of a bribe of P6,000.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Did the accused have his revolver in a holster?\u2014A. It was in the holster. \nAfter I had told him not to point it at me, he put it into the holster.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Did he point it at you ?\u2014A. Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. At whom else did he point it?\u2014A. Only at me.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Was it at that moment that the opium was seized, or was it long \nafterwards?\u2014A. At that moment when the four men entered and caught {sic.) for we \ngot away from the tins.\"<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cross-examination by Mr. Sotto:<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. Then do I understand that you gave up the opium to the accused and to his \ncompanions under the promise made by Anatalio Alviola that you would pay them \nP6,000 as a bribe\u2014that is, P1,000 to each one?\u2014A. Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. And did you agree to give the P6,000 when you should have them ?\u2014A. When \nthey should return the opium to me.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Where was the delivery of the P6,000 to be made? Did you folks make no \nagreement?\u2014A. On the departure of the policeman, Albao told Anatalio Alviola \nthat on the following day he should go to that place. I do not know what place \nhe meant.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Who told him?\u2014A. Albao told Anatalio Alviola. <\/p>\n<p>\"Q. What I want to know is: Did you folks have an agreement as to when the \nopium was to be delivered, when it was to be returned, and the delivery of the \nmoney was to be made?\u2014A. It was our understanding that Anatalio Alviola was to \npay the policemen and keep the opium.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. When?\u2014A. Right there he and I agreed to that. As I had said to him: 'I \nhave not a single centavo with which to pay the policemen;' he replied to me: I \nhave brought money with me. I will attend to paying the policemen and will \nreturn to you to-morrow what remains of the price of the opium.'<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Then he obligated himself to deliver the P6,000 to the policemen?\u2014A. Yes, \nsir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. So he promised you that he would pay the P6,000 to the policemen, as a \nbribe; that he would keep the opium; and that he would pay you the remainder of \nthe price of the opium after deducting the payment of the P6,000 to the \npolicemen, did he not?\u2014A. He said that he would, on condition that he recovered \nthe opium.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. How many tins did you folks open for examination ?\u2014 A. One.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Who kept the tin that was opened?\u2014A. The policeman Albao afterwards again \nasked the owner of the house for the tin which the latter carried in his \nhand.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Do you know whether or not Anatalio Alviola gave the accused and his \ncompanions the P6,000 agreed upon?\u2014A. The next day he told me that he had not \nfound the opium.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Answer my question. You are clever enough to know. Do you know whether or \nnot Anatalio Alviola delivered to the accused and his five companions the \nP6,000?\u2014 A. No, sir,<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Do you know whether Anatalio Alviola delivered the P6,000 to the accused \nand his companions?\u2014A. I do not.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Do you know whether the accused delivered the opium to Anatalio \nAlviola?\u2014A. I know nothing of that, either.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Where did you get that opium?\u2014A. I found that opium there in Mabolo.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. When?\u2014A. That same day, the 23d, in the morning.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. In what place?\u2014A. In front of Mr. Isabelo Alburo's house.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. On dry land, or in the sea?\u2014A. In the sea.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Why were you there on the 23d?\u2014A. Because for the past month I had been \nin the habit of bathing every morning in Mabolo.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. And were you bathing on that day?\u2014A. Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. In what condition did you find that opium? I mean: Where was it \nplaced?\u2014A. Those tins were placed in another large tin which I found in the \nmud.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Where did you afterwards carry it?\u2014A. I carried it afterwards to the \nhouse where I live on Calle Magallanes, to the upper floor of the furniture \nstore.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. How did you carry it?\u2014A. In a tartanilla (carriage).<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Are you sure that it was on the 23d?\u2014A. I think so. It was that very \nday.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. The 23d of June of this year ?\u2014A. Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Do you know why Anatalio Alviola was in the house on Calle Legaspi on the \nnight of the occurrence?\u2014A. According to what Ciriaco Singson told me, it was \nbecause he, also, wished to buy the tins that might be left over.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Do you know Francisco Jurado by sight, the owner of the house?\u2014A. Yes, \nsir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Who personally carried the opium after it had been taken away \nfrom you ?\u2014A. It was carried by two men.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Who?\u2014A. I was unable to observe who were the two that carried the opium, \nbut they carried it by the order of Albao and of the other man who had the \npalasan.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. When did the interview take place that was had between you and Isabelo \nAlburo, relative to finding purchasers for the opium?\u2014A. On the 23d, at about 9 \nor 10 o'clock in the morning.\"<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Examination by the fiscal:<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. You said this morning, in reply to the cross-questions of the attorney \nfor the accused, that a bribe was offered to the policemen who were there. Who \noffered the bribe ?\u2014A. Anatalio Alviola and I. It was rather Ciriaco Singson who \nfirst made the proposal.\" Second. Isabelo Alburo, who testified, in part, as \nfollows:<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Where were you on the 23d of June of this year?\u2014A. In Cebu.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Do you know Mr. Vicente Lizarraga?\u2014A. Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Did something happen between you and Lizarraga on that 23d day of June of \nthis year?\u2014A. On that day, at a little after 11 o'clock, I went to the furniture \nstore to collect from Mr. Solsiaga a bill of P43.10, the amount due for 100 \npieces of bamboo which he obtained from me for the purpose of repairing his \nhouse and for several cartloads of stone. After the account had been settled, I \ninquired of Mr. Lizarraga whether he had any objection to going to my house, \nbecause, a week before that day, as the furniture store sold on installments, my \nwife had taken a combination wardrobe and mirror, to be paid for at the rate of \nP10 a month; and as the wardrobe that was delivered at the house had a bad lock, \nI begged Mr. Lizarraga to go to the house to fix it, if he had no objection. On \nthat day Mr. Lizarraga had no objection in accompanying me to the house. We \nwent, both on bicycles, at a little after 11 o'clock. We passed along Calles \nMagallanes and Martires. While traveling on Calle Magallanes Mr. Lizarraga \ninquired of me: 'Do you know of anybody who wishes to take a lot of opium?' I \nreplied, saying: 'It is publicly known that there is a good Filipino buyer here, \nwho is Mr. Ciriaco Singson. I was present at the hearing of the case against the \nengineer of the Rubi, Ben Rice, and it appears that everybody knows that Ciriaco \nSingson buys opium.' Mr. Lizarraga then said to me: 'Have you no objection to \nintroducing me to Mr. Singson?' I told him that I could not introduce him; that \nthough it was true that he (Singson) was an acquaintance of mine, there was no \nintimacy between us. During our passage through Calle Magallanes we came in \nfront of the market and the house of Mr. Graciano del Mar. I said to him \n(Lizarraga); \"This gentleman is one of Mr. Singson's friends and I am very \nintimate with him. Sunday before last he was at my house with Duterte's family \nto take a bath in the sea. This gentleman can, if you wish, introduce you to Mr. \nSingson.' Mr. Lizarraga said to me: 'See if you can introduce me to that \ngentleman (Del Mar).' I got off my bicycle and said to Graciano del Mar, who was \nat the window: 'This gentleman, it seems, desires to talk with you.' Graciano \ninvited us upstairs. Upon going up he requested us to be seated, and I said to \nLizarraga: 'Here is Mr. Del Mar.' They both engaged in conversation, and I heard \none of them say: 'I have a lot of opium. If you can find a purchaser, I shall be \nvery glad to dispose of that lot.' Mr. Del Mar said that he had no objection to \nspeaking to Mr. Singson. After it had been agreed upon that he should speak to \nMr. Singson, as it was a quarter to 12, we took leave of Mr. Del Mar and \ndeparted. While we were on the last step of the stair Del Mar inquired of us: \n'Where are you going now?' and I said: 'The gentleman is going to my house to \nfix the wardrobe.' Del Mar inquired: 'Have you any objection, in case I should \nmeet Mr. Singson, to our going to your house V I said to him: 'Anyone may enter \nour house any time that we are there.' Thereupon Lizarraga and I both left on \nour bicycles. When we arrived at the house we set to work to fix the wardrobe. \nAs the clock was striking 12, just for courtesy's sake I invited Mr. Lizarraga \nto have dinner and partake of such food as there was in the house. Mr. Lizarraga \naccepted and remained for dinner. At about half past 1 o'clock the little girl, \nmy daughter, said: 'Papa, there are two gentlemen on the stairs.' I said that \nthey might come up. Mr. Graciano del Mar and Mr. Ciriaco Singson came up. As \nmaster of the house, I introduced Mr. Singson to Mr. Lizarraga, saying: 'This is \nMr. Singson.' They seated themselves and Graciano and I withdrew to one side out \nof politeness. I said to Graciano del Mar: 'The Sunday that you folks were here \nto bathe, did you have a bath robe with you?' Ciriaco Singson and Lizarraga were \ntalking. After a little while, two friends of mine entered. We were talking at \nthe other side of the balcony. While I was talking with those friends, Ciriaco \nSingson and Mr. Lizarraga were talking and Graciano del Mar approached. A short \nwhile afterwards Mr. Lizarraga went out. He rode away on his bicycle. About \ntwenty minutes afterwards he returned. Upon Lizarraga's return his pocket was \nfull. I was still talking with my friends. Pretty soon he took out a paper and \nshowed some tins. I saw them at a distance. I saw that there was a broken tin \nand that the paper was stained black, I immediately approached and on seeing \nthat it was opium immediately said: 'Gentlemen, please go out. Indeed this is a \nstrange thing. An agent of the authorities may come and you folks may cause harm \nto the owner of the house. You may go down, for I can not allow you to make this \ndeal here in the house.' Mr. Lizarraga picked up the paper bundle and went down. \nShortly afterwards Graciano del Mar and Ciriaco Singson also went down.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. On the following day, the 24th, what happened in connection with that \nopium?\u2014A. Some few minutes after 2 o'clock while I was sleeping Mr. Singson came \nin, awoke me, and merely charged me to tell Mr. Lizarraga that up to that time \nthe whole of the money was not secured.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. The next day, the 25th?\u2014A. I do not know if it was Graciano del Mar who \nwas at the house in behalf of Mr. Singson. He charged me to tell Mr. Lizarraga \nthat he wanted him to wait here in the Plaza de la Independencia.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Did you transmit the message?\u2014A. Yea, sir; because as an employee of Mr. \nBustillo, I happened to be at the customhouse, and when I came out of the \nbuilding they were playing a serenade in the plaza. I was listening there. \nPretty soon Mr. Singson came up and inquired for Mr. Lizarraga and I told him \nthat he had not yet come. When Mr. Lizarraga arrived I told him that Mr. Singson \nhad been waiting for him and as he had arrived late he charged me merely to tell \nhim that he (Singson) would wait for him in the Merchant Caf 6 at 8 o'clock in \nthe evening. Immediately thereafter Mr. Lizarraga and I separated.\"<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cross-examination by Mr. Sotto:<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. You spoke of an open tin, the contents of which, the opium, had run out \non the paper. Where was that tin opened?\u2014A. I do not know if those tins were \nbroken, but when Mr. Lizarraga opened (the paper) there was a stain, the tin was \nleaking.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Did they not open the tin there?\u2014A. No, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Were there two tins?\u2014A. Two tins.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Two opened?\u2014A. One closed tin and another tin which was a little damaged \nand its contents were leaking out.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Was this your first knowledge of Lizarraga's having opium?\u2014A. Yes, \nsir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Did Lizarraga actually come to see you in the Plaza Libertad, and did you \ntransmit to him Ciriaco Singson's message?\u2014A. Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. At what time did you transmit to Lizarraga Singson's message?\u2014A. At half \npast 5, I think, when I came out of the customhouse. When Ciriaco Singson saw me \nhe inquired of me whether Lizarraga was upstairs. I told him that he was not. He \nsaid to me: 'Please tell Lizarraga that at 8 o'clock this evening I will wait \nfor him in the Merchant Caf\u00e9.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Do you know whether or not that opium which Lizarraga wished to sell to \nor place with Singson, was sold by Lizarraga some days subsequent to the 25th? \n\u2014A. I learned from Lizarraga the next day that the police had taken it from \nhim.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Third. Miguel Batoto, who testified, in part, as follows :<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. Are you acquainted with Alejandro Albao?\u2014A. Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. With Ciriaco Singson?\u2014A. Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Do you know where Mr. Ciriaco Singson was about the 23d of last July, \nvery late in the evening?\u2014A. In his house.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Where were you?\u2014A. In my house also. On the afternoon of the 23d, at \nabout 3 o'clock, he sent the little boy Juan, a younger brother of Candoy's \nwife, Pia, to call me.<\/p>\n<p>\"The Court. What is the name of that Candoy?\u2014A. I do not know his surname. \nThey call him Candoy.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. What else?\u2014A. Juan told me that Ciriaco needed me; I did not know for \nwhat. I went over at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. When I arrived at Ciriaco \nSingsongs house, the latter told me that there was a good chance to do business \nin opium in view of the fact that a person had offered 200 tins for sale. I \ninquired whether he had money. Ciriaco Singson replied to me that there was no \nneed of money, that an arrangement could be made to get the opium by a swindle, \nsince it was an article of contraband. Ciriaco suggested to me that I find a \npoliceman who would seize the opium, and that, in case it could not be obtained \nin this manner, we should have the officer arrest the man, in which event we \nwould receive a certain amount from the Government, as a reward. I said in \nreply: 'Yes, sir; right way.' At 5 o'clock in the afternoon I met Albao and told \nhim that Ciriaco Singson needed him, and we went to Singson's house. I met Albao \nin Calle Magallanes, in David Sommer's store. From David Sommer's store, where I \nmet Albao, we, Albao and I, went to Singson's house. We found the latter in the \ncorridor of his house, near the stair. Thereupon Albao asked Ciriaco Singson \nwhat he desired. Singson told him that a certain person had offered to sell him \n200 tins of opium and that he desired to have them seized from him. Ciriaco \nSingson said: 'Do we agree, Albao?,' and Albao said: 'Yes.' When we were near \nthe porch that faces the street, I asked Albao: 'What do you think of it?' and \nhe said to me that if there really was opium he would arrest the person who had \nit.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Fourth. Graciano del Mar, who testified, in part, as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q, Are you acquainted with Vicente Lizarraga?\u2014A. I have known him only \nrecently. I got acquainted with him on June 24, for the first time, at my \nhouse,<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. How did he come to enter there? Did he go up there into your house ?\u2014A. \nYes. One morning while I was at the window Vicente Lizarraga passed by, in the \ncompany of Mr. Isabelo Alburo; and when Mr. Alburo saw me at the window he asked \nme whether he might come up. I told him that he might. Then Mr. Alburo came up \nalone and Mr. Lizarraga remained below. After Mr. Alburo had come up he proposed \nto me the purchase of 325 tins of opium. I told him that I could not buy them as \nI had no money, and that, besides, I was not dealing in that drug. He said: \n\"Well, you have acquaintances there who buy the drug. You can tell me who can \nbuy it.' I said to him: 1 do not know whether Ciriaco Singson can buy it from \nyou;' and Isabelo said to me: 'Go and tell that to Ciriaco.' Then Isabelo Alburo \nsaid 'The owner of the drug is the man who is downstairs. Do you wish him to \ncome up? I will call him.' I said to him: 'There is no objection. He may come \nup.' And Vicente Lizarraga came up into the house and then Mr. Isabelo Alburo \nintroduced him to me as Mr. Vicente Lizarraga. Alburo then said to me that I \nmight eat in his house with Ciriaco Singson, in order to make the deal. I \nreplied that I could not eat there, but that after dinner I would immediately go \nto look for Ciriaco Singson and tell him about the affair. I went to the house \nof Ciriaco Singson and told the latter that there was a lot of opium which \nIsabelo Alburo told me he wished to sell. After Ciriaco Singson had finished his \ndinner, for he was eating when I came in, he dressed and accompanied me to \nMabolo. There in Mabolo we found Vicente Lizarraga and Isabelo Alburo waiting1 \nfor us in his (Alburo's) house. Then the three men, Ciriaco Singson, Isabelo \nAlburo, and Lizarraga, engaged in a conversation there. After a little while \nVicente Lizarraga went out and we three remained in Isabelo Alburo's house, \nwaiting for Lizarraga, for Isabelo Alburo said that Lizarraga would return. We \nhad waited about half an hour when Lizarraga came, bringing two tins of opium \nwhich he showed to Ciriaco Singson. I could not well hear the agreement they \nwere making, because I was very near the window that faces the street, watching \nto see whether anyone might come to surprise us. Then, after that, I don't know \nwhether or not they came to an agreement; Vicente Lizarraga went down carrying \nthe two tins with him. We two, Ciriaco Singson and I, returned here to the city \nand in the street I asked Singson whether they had agreed upon the purchase. \nCiriaco told me that they had not, for the reason that he had not enough money \nto buy all the tins which Mr. Lizarraga had for sale, for what Mr. Lizarraga \nwanted was to sell all the tins and Singson did not have sufficient money. \nFurthermore, he said that he was afraid that sale of opium involved some deceit, \nthat the article was not really opium. After that, we returned to our houses. I \nremained in ours and he went to his.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Did you see the opium? Was it really opium?\u2014A. I saw there two tins of \nopium, one well closed and another half opened.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Did you hear Ciriaco Singson say anything about that opium ?\u2014A. I asked \nhim about that and he told me that the samples were good, but I do not know \nwhether the other tins that were there were the same as these.\"<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cross-examination by Mr. Sotto:<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. How were Isabelo Alburo and Vicente Lizarraga traveling when you saw them \nfrom the window of your house?\u2014A. On bicycles, both of them,<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Then when Isabelo Alburo went up into your house and Lizarraga waited \nbelow, Isabelo Alburo did not know what persons could buy the opium, and asked \nyou?\u2014A. He asked me whether I wished to buy it. I afterwards told him that I \ncould not, and he himself mentioned the name of Ciriaco Singson, who is a friend \nof mine, as one who could buy this opium. I told him that I knew nothing of it, \nbut could speak to Singson about it, if he wished me to. He said that he did, \nand added: 'Go there soon and we will wait for you at the house for dinner.' I \nsaid that I could not take dinner at his house.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Fifth. Dionisio Jakosalem, who testified, in part, as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"As provincial fiscal I declare under oath that no municipal policeman or \nother person has presented in my office, nor directly to me nor to my assistant, \nMr. Miguel Raffinan, the 200 tins of opium seized from Vicente Lizarraga. As \nprovincial fiscal I also declare under oath that I have ascertained from the \njustice of the peace court of Cebu\u2014the only court after that of First Instance \nthat can initiate proceedings in the matter of the unlawful possession of \nopium\u2014I have there ascertained, I repeat, that the seizure of 200 tins of opium \nfrom Vicente Lizarraga in or about the month of last June was not the subject \nmatter of any consideration or action on the part of the said justice of the \npeace court. And, as provincial fiscal, I also declare under oath that the tins \nof opium referred to in the present case have not yet been the subject matter of \nany prosecution.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The defendant presented five witnesses to support his defense. The first was \nCiriaco Singson. He attempted to deny any relation whatever with Vicente \nLizarraga, in relation to the opium in question. After repeated denials of that \nalleged fact, however, he finally admitted that Vicente Lizarraga offered him \ntwo \"latas de opio,\" but says that the opium was offered to him during the \ndaytinie, and not at night. Such a denial is in effect an admission. He admitted \nthat in relation with one Ben Rice and others, he had attempted to import opium \n(pp. 91, 92); that he was \"un agente de importar opio.\" In Exhibit A (p. 10) he \nalso, in a confession before the prosecuting attorney of the Province of Cebu, \nadmitted the existence of the opium and that Vicente Lizarraga tried to sell the \nsame to him.<\/p>\n<p>The second witness, Francisco Jurado, also denied that the parties were in \nhis house on the day in question (June 23, 24, or 25). He admitted, however, \nthat he had been condemned twice for smoking opium (pp. 100, 101), and that at \nthe very time he was testifying, another action was pending against him for the \nsame crime (p. 101).<\/p>\n<p>Anatolio Alviola testified. He also, on direct examination, denied any \nrelation with Vicente Lizarraga, in relation to the opium in question, but on \ncross-examination, testified as follows: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. Do you know whether Vicente Lizarraga had opium in or about the month of \nJune?\u2014A. Yes.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Since when have you known it?\u2014A. The 26th.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Who told you so?\u2014A. Ciriaco Singson.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. So that Ciriaco Singson had negotiated with Vicente Lizarraga in regard \nto that opium?\u2014A. Ciriaco Singson invited me to pay for 300 tins of opium \nbelonging to Vicente Lizarraga.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. On about the 26th?\u2014A. Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. What conversation did you and Ciriaco Singson have in regard to \nLizarraga's opium?\u2014A. Ciriaco Singson came to my house on the 26th, at about 3 \no'clock in the afternoon, to invite me to buy Vicente Lizarraga's opium. That \nopium belonged to Vicente Lizarraga, but it was Isabelo Alburo who invited \nCiriaco Singson to buy it. So I asked Ciriaco Singson whether it was good opium. \nCiriaco Singson told me that it was, because Isabelo Alburo had shown him a tin \nas a sample. Then I told Ciriaco Singson not to trust Alburo, as he was an \nunreliable man.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Emiliano Fernandez, a policeman of the city of Cebu, also testified on behalf \nof the defendant, for the purpose of showing an alibi, He testified that he had \nseen the defendant, Alejandro Albao, in the public plaza, in the city of Cebu, \nat or about 5 o'clock on the afternoon of the day in question. Admitting that \nfact to be true, the defendant still had time, after this witness saw him, to go \nto the place where the alleged robbery was committed.<\/p>\n<p>Alejandro Albao testified in his own behalf. He denied positively that he had \nhad any relation whatever with the opium in question and that he was not at the \nhouse of Francisco Jurado on the night in question.<\/p>\n<p>Dionisio Jakosalem, prosecuting attorney of the Province of Cebu, was \nrecalled as a witness, and related the circumstances under which the confession \nof Ciriaco Singson was made, as appears in Exhibit A (p. 10).<\/p>\n<p>We think the proof adduced during the trial of the cause, the important parts \nof which we have set out above, not only shows that the lower court did not \ncommit the error complained of in the first assignment of error, but that he did \nnot commit the other errors complained of.<\/p>\n<p>During the pendency of the appeal in this court, the appellant presented a \nmotion for a new trial. As a part of said motion he annexed the decision of the \nCourt of First Instance of the Province of Cebu, rendered in the case of United \nStates <em>vs.<\/em> Ciriaco Singson (No. 3132, Court of First Instance), as well \nas a certificate of the stenographer, to the effect that the witnesses who \ntestified in the case of United States vs. Ciriaco Singson were the same \nwitnesses who testified in the original case of United States vs. Alejandro \nAlbao (No. 2999). It appears from the decision rendered in said case (U. S. vs. \nSingson, No. 3132) that the said Singson had been, after the conclusion of the \ncase against Albao, prosecuted for a violation of the Opium Law. In the decision \nin that case the judge of the lower court commented <em>in extenso<\/em> upon the \ncredibility of the witnesses who had been presented against the defendant. He \nstated that he did not believe their testimony and for that reason acquitted the \ndefendant (Singson) while it does not clearly appear from the decision (in the \ncase against Singson) yet, it would seem that the theory of the prosecution was \nthat Singson was an accomplice of the defendant Albao, in relation with the \nopium in question. It will be remembered, however, that while there is an \nintimation in the proof presented in the case of United States vs. Albao that \nCiriaco Singson operated with Albao, in an indefinite way, in relate tion with \nthe opium in question, yet there is no positive proof of that fact. While it is \na fact that the lower court did not believe the witnesses in the case against \nSingson (No. 3132), yet, nevertheless, he reaffirms his findings of fact in the \ncase of United States vs. Albao, in the following language:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Aside from this question, it is evident that on the night of the crime the \naccused was at the house of Francisco; that, in accordance with the agreement, \nthe of party Vicente Lizarraga arrived at the house, bringing with him 202 tins \nof opium; that while they were in the act of effecting the sale and were \nrecounting the tins of opium, there appeared at the door a man by the name of \nAlbao, armed with a revolver and accompanied by other persons; and that Albao, \ndeclaring himself to be a policeman and in the name of the law, seized the opium \nand took all the tins away with him; that these tins have not been returned or \ndelivered to any authority and assuredly have been divided between Albao and his \naccomplices and asiates in the crime. The said Albao has been sentenced by this \ncourt to ten years of <em>prision mayor<\/em> for his participation on in this \nrobbery.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In view of the foregoing, we do not believe that the mere fact that the lower \ncourt did not believe the witnesses in one case but did believe them in another, \nis sufficient ground upon which to grant a new trial. Therefore the motion for a \nnew trial is hereby denied.<\/p>\n<p>From a careful examination of the record we are of the opinion that the \nfollowing facts are proved, beyond a reasonable doubt:<\/p>\n<p>First. That on or about the 25th day of June, 1913, Vicente Lizarraga was in \nthe possession of 202 \"latas de opio,\" which were of the value of about \nP14,000.<\/p>\n<p>Second. That on the day in question, after repeated efforts to sell the said \nopium, Vicente Lizarraga met Ciriaco Singson together with others, in the house \nof one Francisco Jurado, for the purpose of consummating the sale of the 202 \n\"latas de opio.\"<\/p>\n<p>Third. That on the night in question (25th of June, 1913),\u00a6 while Vicente \nLizarraga and Ciriaco Singson, in the house of Francisco Jurado, were \nnegotiating for the sale of said opium, the defendant Alejandro Albao, together \nwith others unknown, appeared at the house of Francisco Jurado and demanded that \nthe opium be turned over to him, by means of threats and violence, using a \nrevolver and pointing the same at Vicente Lizarraga.<\/p>\n<p>Fourth. That by reason of said threats, intimidation and demands, by using \nhis revolver, the defendant, Alejandro Albao, took possession of said 202 \"latas \nde opio,\" against the will and consent of Vicente Lizarraga.<\/p>\n<p>Fifth. That after the said opium had been delivered in the manner above \nindicated to Alejandro Albao, he promised to return the same upon the payment to \nhim and his unknown associates of the sum of P6,000.<\/p>\n<p>Sixth. That the defendant, Alejandro Albao, had been and was a policeman in \nthe city of Cebu at the time; that he makes no pretense or claim that he was \nacting in his capacity as a policeman at the time he took forcible possession of \nthe opium in question.<\/p>\n<p>Seventh. That the opium in question was never returned to Vicente Lizarraga, \nnor to any public authority.<\/p>\n<p>Eighth. That the defendant, Alejandro Albao, took possession of the said 202 \n\"latas de opio\" by the use of violence and intimidation against the person of \nVicente Lizarraga, with the intent, then and there, to appropriate the same to \nhis own use.

Rep., 357), it \nappears that the accused, with certain other companions, entered the store of a \nChinaman by night, displayed a badge and pretended to be revenue officers. The \naccused made a search of the premises and then pretended that they had found a \nsmall amount of opium. Two of them drew their revolvers and ordered said \nChinaman to follow them; whereupon the accused offered to release him if he \nwould pay them P400. After compelling the Chinaman to follow them in the \ndirection of the municipality, they finally succeeded in obtaining from him the \nsum of P260. It was held that these acts of the defendant constituted the crime \nof robbery.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of United States <em>vs,<\/em> Recio (21 Phil. Rep., 511), the \ndefendant, by means of intimidation and threats of arrest for the violation of \nthe Opium Law, obtained from the offended person the sum of P1,000. This court \nheld, following the decisions of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Smith (3 Phil Rep., \n20); 3 Viada 341; decision of'the supreme court of Spain of June 24, 1875; and \nUnited States <em>vs.<\/em> Flores (19 Phil. Rep., 178), that the defendant was \nguilty of the crime of robbery, punishable under paragraph 5 of article 503 of \nthe Penal Code.<\/p>\n<p>During the trial of the cause there was an effort made to show that Vicente \nEizarraga was not the owner of the opium and that said opium was contraband \ngoods, and that, therefore the crime of robbery could not have been committed \nwith reference to said property. In the commission of the crime of robbery, it \nis not necessary that the person from whom the property is taken, by means of \nthreats and violence, shall be the owner. It is sufficient if the property is \ntaken from him by means of threats arid violence, for the purpose of gain, on \nthe part of the person appropriating it. (Art. 502, Penal Code.) The possession \nof the property is sufficient. Ownership is not necessary.

The lower court imposed the penalty provided by law in its maximum \ndegree, holding that there existed the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity. \nIn our opinion, there is nothing in the record which indicates that the \ndefendant took advantage of the nighttime for the purpose of committing the \ncrime in question. There being neither aggravating nor extenuating \ncircumstances, the defendant should be punished in accordance with the \nprovisions of paragraph 5 of article 503, in relation with article 502 of the \nPenal Code, or in the medium grade of <em>presidio correccional <\/em>to \n<em>presidio mayor<\/em> in its medium grade.

A preliminary question is raised by the appellee as to whether evidence as \nto the disregard of the Election Law in the selection of polling stations and \nthe construction of the voting booths was admissible under the allegations of \nthe motion or petition by which the protestant instituted his contest. An \nelection contest under section 27 of the Election Law is a special summary \nproceeding, the object of which is to expedite the settlement of the controversy \nbetween candidates as to who received the majority of the legal ballots in an \nelection for a specified office. In Arnedo vs. Llorente (18 Phil. Rep., 257) it \nwas held that rules of procedure applicable to ordinary civil actions can only \napply to election contests instituted under section 27 of the Election Law where \nthey are not inconsistent with the provisions of that section, or to meet an \nexigency not provided for in the skeleton procedure there outlined. While we are \nof the opinion that the motion by which the contestant introduces the \nproceedings should be sufficiently comprehensive to apprise his adversary of the \nfrauds or irregularities upon which he relies to obtain a revision of the \nofficial results, in order that the contestee may intelligently prepare his \ndefense, there appears to be no good reason for insisting upon a more stringent \napplication of the rule of <em>allegata et probata<\/em> in an election contest \nthan in an ordinary civil action. Under the liberal provisions of the reformed \nprocedure, this rule of evidence, which, under the common law, was most rigid, \nhas been greatly relaxed, and it is now well settled that a variance between the \nallegations and the proof is immaterial unless the opposite party has actually \nbeen misled or surprised thereby to his prejudice. The truth of the evidence \nobjected to is expressly admitted in various stipulations of counsel for the \nopposing parties during the progress of the trial. The protestee does not object \nto the admission of this evidence upon the ground that he was misled by it or \nthat it surprised him. His objection is the purely technical one that the motion \nwhich instituted the proceedings did not refer to it. Under such circumstances, \nand without considering whether his objection would have been sufficient had the \nproceedings been an ordinary civil action, we do not hesitate to say that the \nevidence was properly admitted. Technicalities are regarded with disfavor, even \nin ordinary civil actions. Theyshould receive still less attention in such a \nsummary proceeding as an election contest.<\/p>\n<p>The evidence objected to is thus summarized in the opinion of the lower \ncourt: \"The condition of the polling places in the municipality of Camiling were \nas follows: <em>The rooms intended for polling places in each of the five \nprecincts of Camiling were located in the upper stories of the respective \nbuildings, <\/em>and it was necessary to climb a stair in order to enter the said \nbooths. Inocencio Guinto describes how the voting booths were constructed, \n'There was,' he says, 'a wire which ran from one side of the room to the other \nand the rods were fastened at one end of a wire the other end of which was \nattached to the wall. The curtains or cloth partitions were hung on the rod \nthere was between the wire and the wall. The piece of cloth used as a division \nof the booths was 1 yard wide and was hung in such a manner that its lower \nborder was about a foot from the floor.<em> There was nothing at the entrance of \nthe booths and in front of the entrances there was no guard rail.<\/em> The only \nguard rail in each of the polling places was that intended for the election \ninspectors, and was in another separate room. <em>In each and all of the five \nprecincts of this municipality the voting booths were arranged in that same \nmanner.<\/em> In each booth there was a school bench used as a writing table by \nthe voters.'\"<\/p>\n<p>In addition to this it may be said that from the testimony of the various \nwitnesses it was proved that the school desks placed in each booth were so \narranged that the voter sat facing the side of the booth, so that anyone passing \nalong the row of booths could easily see what was being written by the voter if \nhe took the trouble to look.<\/p>\n<p>Section 9 of Act No. 1582 provides: \"* * * Each such [polling] place so \ndesignated shall, if practicable, <em>be a room upon the lower floor,<\/em> of \nreasonable size, sufficient to admit and comfortably accommodate twenty electors \nat one time outside the guard rails * * *.<\/p>\n<p>\"There shall be in each polling place during each election a sufficient \nnumber of voting booths, not less than one for every fifty voters in the \nelection precinct.

The provincial treasurer of Tarlac Province testified that he received \nfrom Manila and delivered to the municipal treasurer of Camiling 3,300 blank \nballots. A receipt executed by the municipal treasurer on May 11,1913, \nacknowledges receipt of this number. The municipal treasurer testified that he \ndid not receive this number. Also, that he did not deliver all that he did \nreceive to the election inspectors of the respective precincts.

As opposed to \nthis testimony, we have the admission of counsel for the contestee that the \nprovincial treasurer actually sent 3,300 ballots to Camiling. There was no \nshortage reported from any other municipality in the province. The municipal \ntreasurer testified that he kept these ballots in an <em>aparador<\/em> from the \ndate he received them until election day. On the morning of the election, June \n4, he called a meeting of the inspectors of the various precincts to advise them \nof the shortages. The majority of the inspectors were present, but he could not \nsay if all were there. He did not deliver all the ballots he had received to the \nvarious election boards because, as he stated, the municipal president had \nadvised the provincial treasurer that there were 2,000 voters in Camiling, \nwhereas there were only 1,300. So witness decided to deliver only enough ballots \nto allow one and one-half ballots to each voter. He still had in his possession \nat the time of the trial the remainder of the ballots. Upon being informed by \nthe municipal treasurer of this shortage, the inspectors of the various \nprecincts held a meeting, at which it was decided to mark all the ballots before \nthey were given to the voters, so that if the missing ballots were used by \nanyone, they could be detected. The mark decided on was an accent mark over the \nletter \"O\" of \"Official Ballot,\" printed on the reverse side of each ballot. We \ndo not hesitate to say that the testimony of the municipal treasurer that there \nwas a shortage in each of the packages of ballots he received is, in our \nopinion, false. The ballots were extracted from the packages while in his \ncustody. And in view of his false testimony in this respect, there is a strong \npresumption that they were taken with his knowledge and connivance. An \ninspection of the ballots after the election showed the following results:<\/p>\n<p>Of the ballots found in the two ballot boxes of <em>the first precinct,<\/em> \nall but five bore the accent. Four of these were presented as exhibits for the \ncontestant, and of them the lower court said: \"All of these ballots are found to \nbe marked, on their reverse side, with an accent over the 'O' of 'Official \nBallot,' with the exception of four, Exhibits E-l, E-2, E-3, and E-4, which bear \nno mark whatever. Three of these ballots are for Gregorio Romulo. These ballots \nshould be rejected. As all the ballots of this precinct were marked, those lost \nwhile under the control of the municipal treasurer were utilized here.\"<\/p>\n<p>The municipal, treasurer delivered to this precinct 584 ballots. Five hundred \nand eighty-three were found in the two ballot boxes, leaving an unexplained \nshortage of one ballot.<\/p>\n<p>All the ballots used in the <em>second precinct<\/em> bore the accent mark. Of \nthe 133 blank ballots delivered to the municipal secretary after the election \nfrom this precinct, only 13 bore the distinguishing mark.<\/p>\n<p>None of the ballots used <em>in the third precinct<\/em> bore the \ndistinguishing mark. No explanation is given of this. Whether the inspectors of \nthis precinct were not present when the municipal treasurer advised the \ninspectors that ballots were missing, or whether they were so advised and \ndeclined to agree with the other inspectors to mark the ballots with the accent \nmark agreed upon, is not clear.<\/p>\n<p>All of the ballots used <em>in the fourth precinct<\/em> bore the accent mark. \nOf the 123 blank ballots delivered to the municipal secretary after the election \nfrom this precinct, eight had the distinguishing mark. Five of these eight \nballots showed that they had been doubled in the form in which good ballots are \ndoubled, and then straightened out in order that they might be placed flat in \nthe envelope.<\/p>\n<p>Of the ballots delivered <em>to the fifth precinct,<\/em> the lower court \nfound in this connection as follows: \"All the ballots found in the boxes, except \n19, bear on their reverse side the marks made by the election inspectors; but \namong the blank ballots returned to the municipal secretary, there are some \nwhich are marked the same as those that were used and 87 of them bear a stroke \nacross the letter '0' of the word 'Official' on the inside, and not on the \noutside, of the said ballots.\"<\/p>\n<p>3. According to section 22 of the Election Law, as amended by section 12 of \nAct No. 2045, the following procedure must be observed in the case of voters \nincapable of preparing their own ballots: A voter, otherwise qualified who \ndeclares that he cannot write, or that from blindness, or other physical \ndisability he is unable to prepare his ballot, may make oath to the effect that \nhe is so disabled, and the nature of his disability and that he desires the \ninspectors to assist him in the preparation of such ballot. <em>The board shall \nkeep a record of all such oaths taken<\/em> and file the same with the municipal \nsecretary with all the other records of the board after the election. <em>Two of \nthe inspectors,<\/em> each of whom shall belong to a different political party, \n<em>shall ascertain the wishes of the voter, and one of them shall prepare the \nballot of the voter<\/em> according to his wishes, <em>in the presence of the \nother inspector, and out of view of any other person.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the lower court contains the following comment as to the \ndiscrepancies in the reports rendered by the inspectors of the five precincts of \nCamiling, in compliance with the above provisions of law.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"First precinct: According to the record of the illiterate voters of this \nprecinct, the inspector Marcelino Fabros assisted only three such persons in the \npreparation of their ballots, and Eudoxio Masilongan, twelve. The first named, \nnevertheless, identified 13 ballots as his, written in his own handwriting; and \nthe last named, 32, There is an excess of 30 ballots. It is understood how, for \nvarious reasons, a few names might have been omitted from the list of \nilliterates, but not those of thirty voters. Undoubtedly, these inspectors \nbetrayed the confidence reposed in them, and the ballots written by them merit \nno consideration whatever.<br\/><br\/>\"Second precinct: According to the record of \nilliterate voters, 59 of these were assisted by the inspectors; but the latter \nidentified 77 ballots. There is, therefore, an excess of 18 ballots. Were it a \nquestion of only three or four names, we might say that the election inspectors \nforgot to record these three or four names in the list of illiterates, owing to \nthe haste with which they proceeded in all their acts and to the large number of \nvoters who requested their assistance; but we do not believe that those \ninspectors forgot to enter 18 names. If these men had actually voted, we believe \nthat their names would have appeared in the list or record of illiterates. We \nare of opinion that all these ballots should be rejected; and as 42 of them were \ncast for Romulo and 35 for Gardiner, 42 votes should be deducted from those \nobtained by Gregorio Romulo and 35 from those obtained by Ernesto Gardiner.<\/p>\n<p>\"Third precinct: With respect to illiterate voters, Inspector Juan Guillermo \nassisted 80 of them. One hundred and nineteen ballots were identified as having \nbeen written by this inspector. Of these 119 ballots, 16 are for Ernesto \nGardiner and the rest for Gregorio Romulo. There is proof that 136 illiterate \nvoters voted in this precinct, all of them assisted by Juan Guillermo. It is to \nbe presumed that in the ballot boxes there were 17 more ballots written by this \ninspector. It must be taken into account that Juan Guillermo did not identify \nthe ballots written by himself, but these were identified by his two companions, \nInspectors Zacarias Reyes and Pio Salamanca. Of the 136 illiterates, 54 of them \ntestified that they indicated to Juan Guillermo that they wished to vote for \nGardiner for governor. Of the 119 ballots identified as written by Juan \nGuillermo, only 16 of them were cast for Gardiner. Juan Guillermo defrauded the \nwill of 38 voters for Gardiner, and these votes should be awarded to this \ncandidate and deducted from those obtained by Gregorio Romulo. The other 82 \nilliterates who testified all voted for Gregorio Romulo, which is proved by \ntheir own testimony.<\/p>\n<p>\"Fourth precinct: With regard to the illiterate voters, 49 of them were \nassisted by the election inspectors, but the latter identified only 41 ballots. \nThere must be a few more ballots that were written by these inspectors and which \ncould not be identified by them for some reason or other.<\/p>\n<p>\"Fifth precinct; With respect to the illiterates, it is sufficient to say \nthat, according to the certificate of election, only 73 of them were assisted by \nthe inspectors, while the chairman of the board identified 98 ballots as having \nbeen written by the inspectors.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We do not understand why the court failed to find the inspectors of the \nsecond, third, fourth, and fifth precincts guilty of fraud by the same line of \nreasoning which was applied to the inspectors of the first precinct. <em>In the \nsecond precinct<\/em> the court finds that the discrepancy between the records of \nthe inspectors and their testimony could not be explained as an oversight in the \nkeeping of records. As the discrepancy is only attributable to a willful \ndisregard of the above quoted provisions of section 22, for no good purpose, \ntheir conduct is on a par with that of the inspectors of the first precinct. The \ncourt does find, in effect, that the inspectors <em>of the third precinct<\/em> \ngrossly defrauded the illiterate voters. That, perhaps, is sufficient, without \nexpressly stating that they were guilty of fraudulent acts. <em>In the fourth \nprecinct,<\/em> however, the inspectors' records show that 49 illiterates voted, \nwhile they could identify but 41 ballots, a discrepancy of 8. The explanation is \nthat the inspectors were unable, in eight instances, to recognize their own \nhandwriting. This explanation is not consistent with the well known accuracy \nwith which a person can identify his own handwriting on a document containing as \nmuch of it as a ballot at a general election. The better explanation seems to be \nthat the inspectors deliberately padded the list of illiterates. <em>In the \nfifth precinct,<\/em> where the court found the inspectors guilty of fraud in \nother particulars to such an extent that it was found necessary to annul the \nreturns from that precinct, there can be no question that the shortage of 25 \nilliterates on the records of the inspectors was due to fraudulent \npractices.<\/p>\n<p>In this connection it seems advisable to discuss facts proved at the trial \nwith reference to the manner dn which illiterates were assisted by Inspector \nGuillermo of the third precinct. Guillermo testified that he was asked to write \nsome of the ballots by the voters themselves; that as to others, he noticed they \nwere in the booths doing nothing with their ballots (he could do this as there \nwere no doors to the booths), and presented himself with the offer to write \ntheir ballots for them in order to expedite the voting, but that he was always \naccompanied by another inspector. Both the other inspectors, Reyes and \nSalamanca, testified that Guillermo attended to the writing of these ballots \nhimself, and that he instructed them to stay behind the guard rail around the \ninspectors' desk. As will be noted in the above quotation, a considerable number \nof illiterate voters from the third precinct were called as witnesses. From the \ntestimony of those who declared that they voted for Gardiner, the following \ntactics of Guillermo were exposed: In practically every one of these cases, the \nvoter stated that no other inspector was present when Guillermo wrote his ballot \nfor him. In some cases, when the voter asked for the assistance of two \ninspectors, Guillermo advised him that he was enough; and in most cases \nGuillermo returned the ballot to the voter folded, with instructions not to open \nit or he would lose his vote. These tactics were varied at times. Eutiquio Bunao \ntestified that he gave Guillermo a provisional ballot bearing the name of \nGardiner, for the purpose of writing his official ballot accordingly, but that \nGuillermo thrust it in his pocket and wrote his ballot without reference to it, \nat the same time hiding what he waswriting from the witness. Bailon testified \nthat he requested<br\/>Gardiner to call another inspector to which Guillermo \nreplied by asking why it was necessary to call another inspector when he was \nthere. Guillermo put the provisional ballot which witness handed to him, bearing \nthe name of Gardiner, in his pocket, and concealed what he was writing on the \nballot. Fernando testified that he handed Guillermo his provisional ballot, \nwhich bore Gardiner's name. Guillermo would not accept it and handed it back to \nhim without reading it, saying it was no good. Guillermo told the witness that \nwhat he had written was all right. Pascual testified that he told Guillermo whom \nhe wished to vote for, but Guillermo replied that he already knew. Cebrado \ntestified that when he had told Guillermo his candidates for assemblyman, third \nmember, vice-president, and two councilmen, Guillermo told him that was \nsufficient and refused to write any more names.<\/p>\n<p>The greater number of these witnesses were thoroughly cross-examined, but \ntheir testimony was not shaken in theleast. Their statements as to whom they \nvoted for appear to have been accepted by the lower court as true, inasmuch as \nthe returns from this precinct were revised in accordance with their statements. \nWe see no reason for not also accepting their statements as to the conduct of \nGuillermo.<\/p>\n<p>In this connection it may be well to notice the fact that the protestee \npresented some sixty illiterates from this precinct who testified that they \nvoted for Romulo and that they were assisted by two inspectors. This testimony \nwas intended to rebut that offered by the witnesses for the protestant to the \neffect that the latter were assisted by only one inspector. The admission of \nthis evidence was objected to by the protestant and is raised by him on this \nappeal, but owing to the length of this opinion and the minor importance of the \nquestion in this case, we shall not attempt to determine it at this time. A \ncomparison of the testimony of a considerable number of these witnesses with the \nrecord of illiterates, however, develops at least three discrepancies. Simon Ra~ \nsalon, Domiciano Paz, and Victor Ventura testified that they were assisted by \ninspectors Guillermo and Salamanca while the record of alliterates shows that \nthey were assisted by inspectors Guillermo and Reyes.<br\/><br\/>It seems from the \ntestimony of Vicente, Basilio, Berzosa, and Vicente, four illiterate <em>voters \nof the second precinct,<\/em> that they were also assisted by only one inspector \nin making out their ballots.<\/p>\n<p>It is thus seen that frauds were perpetrated on the illiterate voters of each \nof the five precincts of Oamiling by the inspectors themselves.<\/p>\n<p>4. The testimony of Mariano Morales, a voter of the first precinct, stands \nout prominently as a most glaring abuse of authority on the part of sun election \ninspector. This man spoiled his first ballot, and asked for and received \nanother. He had just written the name of his candidate for the Assembly when \ninspectors Masilongan and Castro approached. Masilongan entered the booth and \nfinished writing the ballot for him. In reply to the inspector's question as to \nwho his candidate for governor was, Morales replied, \"Ernesto Gardiner;\" \nwhereupon the inspector called to a police officer standing in the room, \n\"Officer, take this man out;\" and when the ballot had been completed, the \ninspector Castro, who was looking on, said, \"Now fold your ballot,\" and through \nfear witness folded his ballot and deposited it. The ballot in question was \nproperly identified. The name of witness' candidate for the Assembly was written \nin his own labored handwriting. The rest of the ballot was filled out in the \nhandwriting of the Inspector Masilongan, <em>and Romulo's name appeared as the \nvoter's candidate for provincial governor.<\/em> Trinidad, one of Gardiner's \nwatchers, testified that Gardiner's watchers were not allowed within the polling \nstation during the time the voting was taking place. They were allowed to \nwitness the count of the ballots, but as there was only one light, they could \nnot see the writing on the ballots. Garcia testified that while he was making \nout his ballot, the chairman Castro stood beside him, watching what he was \nwriting; and that through fear he voted for Romulo, although he wanted to vote \nfor Gardiner. The ballot boxes of this precinct were not delivered to the \nmunicipal secretary until the afternoon of the 6th. Although the ballot boxes \nwere sealed with wax, it bore no signet. According to the inspection of the \ncourt, however, the boxes did not appear to have been opened after they were \nsealed.<\/p>\n<p>An inspection of the ballot boxes- of this precinct also showed 19 ballots in \nthe same handwriting. Of these ballots the lower court said: \"Objection was made \nby the plaintiff to the ballots Exhibits Z-l to Z-19, as being in the same \nhandwriting. All of them were cast for Gregorio Romulo for the office of \ngovernor, and a simple inspection is all that is required to disclose that they \nwere written by one or two persons. These ballots were not written by any \ninspector, and inasmuch as, according to the law, no voter may write more than \none ballot, they should be rejected.\"<\/p>\n<p>These ballots were not written by any inspector. The municipal treasurer \nfound only two ballots missing from those destined to this precinct. The \ninspectors accounted for all the ballots delivered to them by the municipal \ntreasurer. How some one other than the inspectors got possession of these \nnineteen ballots and voted them is not explained.<\/p>\n<p><em>In the third precinct,<\/em> as stated above, none of the ballots were \nmarked by the inspectors. According to Guillermo, the inspectors finished their \nlabors at about 7 o'clock on the night of the 6th, but could not immediately \ndeliver the ballot boxes to the municipal secretary as it was raining. It was \npast 11 o'clock when it stopped raining and they were able to proceed to the \nsecretary's house. They reached the latter's house after 12 o'clock. He was \nenabled to fix the time of their departure for and arrival at the secretary's \nhouse because he looked at his watch both times. The secretary refused to \nreceive the boxes as it was after midnight. He and the secretary of the board, \none Santos, thereupon went to the house of one Gil Clemente and spent the night \nthere, taking the boxes with them. The next morning they went to the municipal \nbuilding, and at 7 o'clock met the other members of the board there. While \nawaiting the arrival of the municipal secretary, they noticed that the registry \nnumbers of the illiterate voters had not been placed on the list of illiterates \nwho had voted. They also noted that in some cases the votes for some of the \ncandidates for the municipal council had not been segregated. Also, the cousin \nof one Cansino asked witness how many votes the latter had received, and on \nlooking at the election return he did not find this name. On referring to the \ntally sheets, he saw that this name appeared. According to the election return \nas finally incorporated in the record, this man received 22 votes. On \ndiscovering these imperfections in their reports, they asked the municipal \npresident for desk room in the municipal building to make their corrections, \nwhich was refused them, with- the information that they could return to the \npolling station to complete their labors. This they did, and at 5 o'clock that \nevening they had finished this work and were ready to make another effort to \ndeliver the boxes to the secretary; but it was raining again. At 8 o'clock it \nstopped raining and they then delivered the boxes to the secretary. Clemente's \nhouse, where witness and the secretary spent the night of the 6th, was very \nclose to the municipal secretary's house. Yet, it only took 25 minutes to make \nthe trip from Clemente's house to the polling station the morning of the 7th, \nwhile the night before it took an hour to make the trip from the polling station \nto the secretary's house. The direct examination of this witness, if it could be \nbelieved, was a clear, concise, and logical exposition of the facts relating to \nthe election, the method of conducting the same, all the details as to what took \nplace. Most of his testimony is included in the answer to one question and \ncovers some seven typewritten pages of the record. His cross-examination, \nhowever, presents a series of evasions and insincerities, and shows such an \ninaptitude and hesitancy in answering the questions propounded to him that \ncredence could hardly be given to his testimony if it stood alone. Salamanca \ntestified that he did not see the boxes after the night the secretary refused to \ntake them. Reyes says nothing about spending the 7th in the polling station \ncorrecting the records of the board. The municipal secretary testified that he \nsaw all the inspectors at the municipal building on the morning of the 7th and \nthat they did not deliver the boxes to him as they had some corrections to make. \nThe boxes were delivered to him that night between 9 and 10 o'clock. According \nto Reyes, who also referred to his watch, it was 12 o'clock when they finished \nwith the returns and started for the secretary's house on the night of the 6th, \nand 12.30 when the secretary refused to receive them. According to the \nsecretary, it was 12.20 when the inspectors appeared at his house with the \nboxes. Reyes repeatedly stated that Guillermo told him and Salamanca to leave \nthe conduct of the election to him and he would look out for things. From the \ntestimony of this witness and a letter written by him at the request of counsel \nfor the appellee, it is quite evident that this witness was hardly competent to \nbe an inspector at an election, as he wrote with difficulty, and did not \nunderstand Spanish at all well. Gil Clemente, at whose house Guillermo and the \nboard's secretary spent the night of the 6th with the ballot boxes, testified \nthat on the morning of the 7th, just as he got up, these two persons were \nsealing the boxes with wax. Later on in the day he found two pieces of wax \nunderneath his house. Of this matter the lower court says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The ballot boxes of this precinct were carried to a private house, that of \none Gil Clemente, at about 12.30 at night on June 6, 1913. The reason why that \nwas done, was because the municipal secretary refused to receive the said ballot \nboxes when they were delivered to him, on the ground that the hour for effecting \nsuch delivery had already passed. Gil Clemente testified that on the following- \nday he had seen Juan Guillermo seal the ballot boxes with wax. Juan Guillermo \ndenied this, and the poll clerk, Victor de los Santos, who accompanied Juan \nGuillermo while he had the custody of the ballot boxes, was not called upon to \ntestify. On the other hand, there is no proof that the contents of the said \nboxes were touched. These boxes were properly sealed and the other inspectors of \nelection have not ventured to testify that the seals were broken. The result of \nthe recount made by the commissioners is in entire agreement with that found in \nthe statement of the inspectors.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Nevertheless, the <em>pro forma<\/em> denial of Juan Guillermo does not merit \nmuch weight when we consider the frauds practiced by him on the illiterate \nvoters, his unsatisfactory testimony, and the contradictory evidence contained \nin the declarations of Inspectors Reyes and Salamanca and of Clemente. Guillermo \nwas practically the whole election board and the other two inspectors did not \ninterfere with his acts. Having perpetrated frauds on illiterate voters, he \nwould certainly not have hesitated to commit other fraudulent acts if he had the \nopportunity; and since the returns were practically prepared by him, the mere \nfact that they agree with the recount made by the commissioners is not a \nconvincing argument that he did not tamper with the ballots and falsify the \nreturns in other ways. Opportunities to do so were not lacking, and the time at \nhis disposal, some seventy-two hours, was sufficient for the purpose.<\/p>\n<p><em>In the fourth precinct,<\/em> the ballot boxes were opened twice between \nthe time of their delivery to the municipal secretary by the inspectors and \ntheir delivery to the clerk of the trial court. Asuncion, one of the inspectors \nin this precinct, testified that this was done in the municipal building the \nfirst time in the presence of all the inspectors, and the second time in the \nabsence of Inspector Espiritu. Nevertheless, this inspector's name appears on \nthe paper with which the box was sealed. Primero, the remaining inspector, \ntestified the second day of the trial that his signatures appearing on the paper \nwith which the box of good ballots was sealed, were not his; but a week later, \nwhen the ballot box was not before him, he testified that those signatures were \nhis. He further testified on this occasion that the ballot boxes were opened \nonly once.<\/p>\n<p><em>As to the fifth precinct,<\/em> it is sufficient to quote from the opinion \nof the lower court: \"Three ballots, therefore, have disappeared, for the \ncommissioners found only 271 good ballots in the ballot box. We are of the \nopinion that the ballot boxes of this precinct were tampered with. This opinion \nis strengthened by the document (p. 62 of the record) which reads: 'The board of \nelection inspectors of the fifth electoral district decided to make a second \ncanvass of the ballots previously counted on June 4, 1912, in view of an \nirregularity committed by its chairman, Ramon Barvo, in reading the ballots not \nin conformity with the names that appear thereon. And, for such purposes as may \nbe proper, we hereunto affix our signatures, in Camiling, this 6th day of June, \n1912. (Sgd.) Simon Hilario, Inspector. (Sgd.) Nicasio Agliam, Inspector.' \nFurther support of this opinion lies in the fact that the ballot boxes of this \nprecinct were not sealed.\"<\/p>\n<p>5. It seems that on the eve and day of the election most of the candidates \nfor governor and municipal president were distributing provisional ballots with \ntheir names written thereon. The plan was for their constituents to take these \nballots into the booths and copy therefrom to the official ballots in order that \nno mistake might be made. Romulo's provisional ballots bore his photograph on \nthe reverse side, while Gardiner's ballots were devoid of any such \nembellishment; so the provisional ballots of the two rival candidates were \neasily distinguishable.<\/p>\n<p><em>In the first precinct,<\/em> the witness Morales testified that he met \nGovernor Romulo on the stairway leading up to the polling station as he went in \nto vote and as he came out. Estrade testified that he voted about 8 o'clock in \nthe morning. At this time, the governor was on the stairway exchanging his \nsample ballots for those carried by Gardiner's constituents, and telling them to \nvote for him and that if they did not to look out, as he would be governor until \nOctober. The governor talked to each one individually and spoke in a low voice \nso that he could not be heard unless one was near him. He saw the governor \nexchange about twenty ballots in this manner, and then went to inform Gardiner. \nThe latter complained to Captain Reyes of the Constabulary, who was in the \nmunicipality that morning, and Captain Reyes thereupon came to the polling \nstation of the first precinct, and made the people about the polling station \nclear the 30-meter space around the station. The voters did not accept the \nballots handed to them by Romulo willingly but through fear of him. Salvador, \nwho voted about 7 o'clock in the morning, testified that he saw Governor Romulo \non the stairway; that he was depriving Gardiner's adherents of his provisional \nballots and substituting his (Romulo's) own. He took some of these Gardiner \nballots from the pockets of the voters and thrust his own in in place of them. \nHe saw the governor exchange about 40 ballots in this manner. He watched this \nproceeding about twenty minutes, until one Cabrera informed the people that they \nwere violating the law by remaining there. On hearing this, witness left, but \nthe governor went on up the stairway where there were more voters. Some of the \nvoters appeared willing to accept Romulo's ballots, while other accepted them \nonly because they were afraid of the governor. Juan Garcia voted in the first \nprecinct at a little after 8 o'clock. He testified that the governor was on the \nstairway of the building exchanging his own ballots for Gardiner's. He (witness) \nhad one of Gardiner's ballots and intended to vote for him when the governor \nmade him exchange it for one of his own, saying that if he did not vote for him \nhe had better look out, as he would be governor until October. Through fear of \nthis threat he voted for Romulo. Chairman Castro of the election board was \nwatching him while he wrote out his ballot. Pedro Gampon, an illiterate, \ntestified that Governor Romulo exchanged a Gardiner ballot which he had intended \nto use when he voted, for one of his own, saying that he had better look out if \nhe did not vote for him. The governor was on the stairway at this time, which \nwas about 7 o'clock. The cross-examination of these witnesses, although \nthorough, did not develop any material discrepancies or inconsistencies in their \ntestimony. Their declarations are confirmed to a certain extent by the testimony \nof Captain Reyes, who testified that Gardiner informed him that Romulo was \nelectioneering within the thirty-meter limit in the first precinct, and that on \ngoing to the polling station he found the crowd gathered around the stairway, \namong whom was the governor, who was talking to the people.<\/p>\n<p>Of the charges of threats in this precinct the lower court said: \"The most \nimportant point in this matter, in connection with this precinct, is the \nallegation that the governor, Gregorio Romulo, was changing ballots, threatening \nwith imprisonment such voters as would not change their ballots, and saying to \nthem besides that he would be governor until October. <em>Apparently all this \nwas nothing else than electioneering within the 30-meter limit.<\/em> It is most \nlikely that Ernesto Gardiner was told of these things and complained of such \nthreats to Captain Reyes of the Constabulary. Now then, Captain Reyes testified \nthat only Gardiner told him that Romulo was electioneering within the 30-meter \nlimit, and that in view of this complaint by Mr. Gardiner, he, the witness, \ncleared the voters out of the space comprised within the 30 meters. Moreover, \nthe ballots concerned were provisional ones, not official ballots, and there is \nno evidence whatever that those electors in voting did not do so freely in favor \nof the candidates they desired to see elected.\"<\/p>\n<p>We are at a loss to understand this appreciation of the above testimony. \nEither it is true or it is not true. If it its true, Governor Romulo was \ncertainly guilty of something more serious than a mere nonobservance of the \n30-meter space around the polling station. Depriving an elector of a provisional \nballot given to him by another candidate and forcing upon him one of his own, \naccompanied by veiled threats of the consequences of not voting for him, \ncertainly exceeds the limits of legitimate campaigning which Governor Romulo was \nentitled to carry on. The testimony of the above witnesses is not rebutted by \nany satisfactory evidence in the record. No valid reason has been suggested nor \ncan we conceive of any for rejecting this testimony. Our conclusion is that the \nlower court failed to give it its proper weight, and that the charges of threats \nand intimidation in this precinct are established by the great preponderance of \nthe evidence.<\/p>\n<p>The polling station <em>in the second precinct<\/em> was in the house of Juan \nVigilia, a sergeant of the municipal police who was apparently charged with \ninspecting the various polling precincts of the municipality. He was a Romulo \nadherent. Captain Reyes found him near the entrance to the stairway of the \npolling station in the second precinct, talking to the voters, and admonished \nhim that even though the house belonged to him it did not look well for a police \nofficer to be violating the Election Law in that manner. Witness Del Rosario \ntestified that he was around the polling station all day. He did not vote until \nabout 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon. At between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning \nhe saw the president of the municipal board of health, Juan Bauson, within the \n30-meter limit around the polling station. From his testimony it appears Bauson \nwas following the same tactics as were attributed to the governor himself in the \nfirst precinct. At between 9 and 11 o'clock witness saw the governor there and \nhe also was exchanging ballots and using threats. The governor remained about \nhalf an hour. He saw Captain Reyes reprimand Vigilia for violating the 30 meter \nspace around the polling station. In the afternoon he could see Vigilia in the \nroom where the booths were located, walking up and down the room, but did not \nsee him talking to anyone. In the morning Vigilia was using threatening language \nat the foot of the stairway. Domingo Acosta corroborates Del Rosario in all \nimportant particulars, and one Clemente, a partisan and nephew of the candidate \nfor municipal president of the same name, testified that he saw Vigilia in the \npolling station on at least two occasions talking to the inspectors and \nelectors. The appellant in this case, Ernesto Gardiner, testified that as he and \nPapa were passing the polling station of the second precinct in a caJesa on \ntheir way to the third precinct at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, he saw \nVigilia standing near the window of the polling station, talking to an elector. \nThey stopped the calesa and Papa called out to Vigilia asking why he was \nelectioneering in the polling station, to which Vigilia replied that they (Papa \nand Gardiner) had already lost. Vigilia denied this, saying that the only time \nhe was in the polling station was when he voted, sometime in the afternoon. He \nspent the entire day inspecting the different precincts, visiting each one three \ntimes. He resigned from the police force on June 10. Juan Bauson, the president \nof the municipal board of health, testified that he was not in the second \nprecinct on election day at all. Captain Reyes testified that he saw Bauson in \nthe morning, whether in the first or second precinct he could not remember. \nBauson testified that he saw Captain Reyes in the first precinct at noon, when \nhe voted there. But Captain Reyes left the municipality at 10.30 in the morning. \nBauson denied making any threats whatever. He first testified that he was only \nin the third and fourth precincts, but later on in his testimony said he was \nalso in the first precinct when he voted there. He was in the fourth precinct \nabout two hours in the afternoon, in the third precinct between 4 and 5 o'clock, \nand in the first precinct at 12 o'clock. The court summed up all this testimony \nas follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is also alleged that one Bauson, the president of the board of health of \nCamiling, changed in this precinct the provisional ballots the voters had for \nother ballots in favor of Mr. Romulo, and that he said, besides, that they'd \nbetter look out, for however it turned out, Mr. Romulo would be governor until \nOctober. It is also alleged that Romulo threatened the voters by saying to them \nthat if they did not vote for him they'd better look out, and that he afterwards \ntreated them to gin in a bar. Threats must be serious and formal and infuse in \nthe mind sufficient fear to restrain personal liberty of action. The acts \nperformed by Bauson and Governor Romulo, as well as those of Sergeant Vigilia of \nthe municipal police, do not constitute threats; they are simply electioneering \nacts.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The evidence of misconduct in this precinct on the part of Romulo and his \npartisans is stronger, if anything, than the evidence relating to their actions \nin the first precinct. The polling station was even placed in the dwelling \nhou&amp;e of one of his supporters. It will be noted that the lower court was of \nthe opinion that the statements of Romulo and Bauson that the voters had better \nlook out as Romulo would be governor until October did not constitute a threat. \nIf we correctly interpret this expression, it was in the way of a warning of \nimpending evil in case the persons to whom it was addressed did not do a \nspecified thing. We agree with the court that a threat must be serious. At the \nsame time we cannot believe that the threats were intended as mere pleasantry. \nWhether they were spoken merely with the intention of intimidating the voters \nand were mere bluster, or whether Romulo and his friends believed themselves to \nbe in a position and intended to punish the voters in case these instructions \nwere disregarded, is immaterial. If they were sufficient to inspire fear, which \nit appears they did, they were threats. It must also be remembered that these \nthreats emanating, as they did, from officers who were then in power, must have \ncarried more weight than had they been uttered by a faction not yet in \npower.<\/p>\n<p>Pio Salamanca, an inspector <em>of the third precinct,<\/em> testified that \none Ricardo Reyes, a stepson of Diego Reyes (the latter a candidate for \nmunicipal president), armed with a bolo, was in the polling station about one \nhour in the afternoon, threatening Gardiner's adherents and exchanging the \nprovisional ballots which they carried for Romulo's. Jose Andres testified that \nwhile he was in a booth writing his ballot, Reyes approached him and told him he \nhad better call an inspector to write his ballot for him and told him to vote \nfor Romulo or something would happen to him. Candido Calimlim and Anastasio \nSantos were called as witnesses, and it was stipulated that they would testify \nas had Jose Andres. Zubiate and Bravo, two municipal policemen on guard in the \nthird precinct, testified that the only time Reyes entered the polling station \nwas when he voted, at about 12 o'clock.<\/p>\n<p>Of this testimony, the court said :<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Intimidation is also charged here. It is alleged that one Ricardo Reyes, \ncarrying a bolo at his waist, threatened the voters in the polling place to make \nthem vote for Gregorio Romulo. It is impossible to conceive the performance of \nsuch an act. All the election officers were at the time within the polling place \nand batches of 24 voters were continually and alternately entering and leaving, \nfor the purpose of voting. Besides, there were in the immediate vicinity of the \npolling place municipal policemen, Constabulary officers, and some 90 voters who \nwere awaiting their turn. Under these circumstances, such acts could not be \nattempted without being immediately repressed.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><em>In the fourth precinct<\/em> Vicente Ines testified that he had one of \nGardiner's ballots and that when he came within 20 meters of the polling \nstation, Juan Bauson (reference to whom has already been made while discussing \nthe second precinct) saw the ballot and told him that that ballot was bad, and \ngave him another ballot, saying that that was his and that i\u00a3 he did not vote \nthat way he would be sent to the provincial jail at Tarlac. Inspector Primero \nwrote his ballot for him, and witness told him he wanted to vote for Gardiner, \nbut Primero said, \"Leave that to me. I will take care.\" Bauson testified that he \nwas in the fourth precinct but that he did not make any threats there. He said \nthat he talked with one of Gardiner's partisans trying to convince him that he \nought to vote for Romulo, but as this man stated that his candidate had given \nhim a ballot to vote he left him. He talked to another Gardiner man, but as he \nsaw he was a bitter partisan of Gardiner, he did not care to exchange ballots \nand left him. He was within the 30-meter limit at this time because the crowd \nwas there. He carried about twenty of Romulo's provisional ballots that day. \nCaptain Reyes testified that he found the people disregarding the 30-meter limit \naround this precinct also. This was about 9 o'clock in the morning. Of this \nprecinct the court said: \"There is no proof that the elections in this precinct \nwere not held in a perfectly regular manner.\"<\/p>\n<p>Andres Andres, <em>of the fifth precinct,<\/em> testified that he saw the \ngovernor within the 30-meter limit, as well as one Francisco Reyes, an adopted \nson of Romulo. Reyes was there from the opening of the polls until after 9 \no'clock, exchanging ballots and threatening those who seemed unwilling to take \nthe ballots he offered them. Eulogio Madriaga arrived at the polling station \nabout 9 o'clock and saw Reyes erase Gardiner's name from one of his provisional \nballots carried by an elector whom witness knew. Pablo Agustin testified that \nReyes exchanged some forty ballots, telling the voters that Gardiner was a \nSpaniard and that if they voted for him the friars would get back into power. \nReyes admitted that he had changed the name on the ballot referred to by \nMadriaga but said that he first secured the permission of the voter. He \ntestified that he changed the names on several other ballots with the permission \nof the voters. He saw Gardiner's adherents distributing provisional ballots and \nthis caused him to become enthusiastic in espousing Romulo's cause, and after \nthey had left, he approached several of these voters and found they were really \nRomulo's men. The court says nothing about this testimony, probably because the \nentire returns from this precinct were thrown out for the reasons stated in the \nquotation from its opinion appearing above.<\/p>\n<p>Such is the resume of the more important evidence from the record before us. \nOur conclusions from a review of this evidence are as follows:<\/p>\n<p>1. That in all of the precincts of Camiling the booths were on the second \nfloor instead of on the lower floor as required by law.<\/p>\n<p>2. That in all these five precincts, due to the absence of doors to the \nbooths, the fact that the desks on which the ballots were marked faced the sides \nof the booths, and the fact that there were no guard rails in front of the \nbooths, the ballots were exposed to the view of persons passing in front of the \nbooths in the very act of being marked by the voter, thus practically destroying \nthe secrecy with which the law requires that the elector shall be protected \nwhile marking his ballot.<\/p>\n<p>3. That ballots were surreptitiously abstracted from the packages of printed \nblanks while in the custody of the municipal treasurer and never recovered; that \nthe accent mark placed over the letter \"0\" in the phrase \"Official Ballot\" on \nthe reverse side of the ballots was not an adequate mark whereby to distinguish \nthe remaining blank forms from those illegally taken from the supply; that this \nofficial mark was not observed at all in the third precinct and that in none of \nthe precincts were all the blank forms received by the respective election \nboards thus marked; that not even ordinary precautions were taken by the various \nelection boards to prevent the stolen ballots from being voted.<\/p>\n<p>4. That the election board in each of the five precincts (except the fourth) \nperpetrated unconscionable frauds in marking the ballots of the illiterate \nvoters; and that in the fourth precinct there was a discrepancy between the list \nof illiterates as shown by the election records and the number of such ballots \nidentified as having been written by the members of the board, for which they \nfailed to render any satisfactory explanation. Of the truth of these findings \nthere can be no serious question.<\/p>\n<p>5. The most difficult point to determine is whether Romulo and his adherents \nwere guilty of a species of electioneering on election day amounting to \nintimidation of the voters. A consideration of the evidence bearing on this \nphase of the case and the judge's findings relative thereto, convince us that \nthe lower court failed to give it due consideration. The evidence as to the \nforcible exchange of provisional ballots, threats, and intimidation in the first \nand second preqincts is particularly strong. A considerable number of witnesses \ntestified as to the intimidation of voters in these precincts. As we read this \ntestimony it is convincing and devoid of serious discrepancies or \ninconsistencies. Nothing contained therein taxes the credibility unless it be \nthat so prominent an official as the governor of the province should resort to \nor countenance such unworthy and reprehensible practices in order to succeed \nhimself in office. Governor Romulo did not testify. All of the others who were \naccused of resorting to these tactics in his behalf, however, did so testify. \nFrom the testimony of the latter we find them all self-acknowledged adherents of \nRomulo and in some instances his relatives. We find Juan Vigilia, the local \npolice officer charged with the maintenance of order around the polling \nstations, himself disregarding the law in this respect, and talking to voters \nwhom he also allowed to crowd around the entrance to the polling station, which, \nincidentally, was his own private residence. We find Bauson testifying that he \nsaw Captain Reyes in the first precinct at 12 o'clock while Captain Reyes had \nleft the municipality at half past ten o'clock; and by the testimony of Captain \nReyes it is established that Bauson was seen by him in the first or second \nprecinct on the morning of the election. The evidence as to intimidation and \nthreats in the other precincts is not so strong. In the third precinct \nparticularly we are inclined to agree with the lower court that such evidence is \nfar fetched and unreliable. In the fourth precinct the evidence of intimidation \nis limited to the testimony of one witness. Bauson, however, admits that he \ntalked to two voters in this precinct and if the evidence of his conduct in the \nfirst precinct is to be believed, there is good reason for presuming that he \nassumed the same arrogant bearing in the fourth precinct, as testified by the \nwitness Ines. In the fifth precinct Francisco Reyes, a relative of Romulo, \nappears from the testimony of several witnesses to have threatened and \nintimidated voters.<\/p>\n<p>After a careful consideration of the evidence before us, we have come to the \nconclusion that Romulo, Bauson, Vigilia, and Reyes were guilty of forcing \nRomulo's provisional ballots upon unwilling constituents of Gardiner, by \nthreatening and intimidating them in a manner calculated to make them believe \nthat, on the principle of the maxim \"Of two evils choose the lesser,\" it would \nbe advisable to vote for Romulo. The first three named spent the greater part of \nthe day visiting the various precincts. Two of them were prominent municipal \nofficers, and the other occupied the highest office in the province. There can \nbe no doubt that such a combination was capable of intimidating the more \nignorant and poorer class of electors by threatening reprisals if they did not \nvote for Romulo. We are led irresistibly to the conclusion that Romulo's \nhandsome plurality, or better said, majority, in each of the five precincts was \ndue to a great extent to the intolerant and high-handed methods above set forth, \nin the execution of which it appears he actively participated.<\/p>\n<p>But withal, we would not be heard to say that there were not honest votes \ncast for Romulo in Camiling. There were undoubtedly many voters who honestly \nbelieved that Romulo was the candidate most worthy of the office of provincial \ngovernor, who cast their votes for him from no other reason than that he was \ntheir choice for the office, nor that there were no electors superior to the \nthreats of the Romulo faction and who marked their ballots for Gardiner, despite \nthe fact that they were compelled to mark them exposed to the view of persons \npassing by the booths, and whose ballots were correctly counted by the election \ninspectors despite their illegal favoritism for Romulo. This leads us to a \nconsideration of the principles upon which we have determined to avoid the \nreturns from Camiling, notwithstanding the ballots of such voters.<\/p>\n<p>The purity of elections is one of the most important and fundamental \nrequisites of popular government. To banish the spectre of revenge from the \nminds of the timid or defenseless, to render precarious and uncertain the \nbartering of votes, and lastly, to secure a fair and honest count of the ballots \ncast, is the aim of the law. To accomplish these ends, Act No. 1582 was enacted. \nThis law requires that only qualified electors shall be admitted to the polls; \nthat they shall vote in absolute secrecy, and that the returns shall be justly \ncompiled and announced. In its essential details, this law is a counterpart of \nthe ballot laws almost universally adopted within comparatively recent times in \nthe United States, and is generically called by textwriters the Australian \nballot law. The interpretation and application of the essential features of this \nlaw have received the attention of the high courts of every jurisdiction where \nit hasbeen enacted, and a noticeable effort has been made to divide its \nprovisions into those mandatory and those directory, the former being supposed \nto have the effort of vitiating the returns when not complied with, while the \neffects of a disregard of the latter are held to be contingent upon whether they \naffect the merits of the proceeding. The provisions of the law as to the \n<em>conduct<\/em> of the elections which were disregarded in the five precincts \nof Camiling which first attract attention are that the polling station shall be \nupon the ground floor, that the booths shall have four sides enclosed, the one \nin front to open and shut as a door, and that they shall be provided with a \nguard rail. (Sec. 9, quoted <em>supra<\/em>.) The law does not specify the \nconsequences of a nonobservance of any one of these requirements, and it is \ntherefore our duty, upon well established rules of interpretation and \nconstruction of statutes, to consider whether a failure to observe them violates \nthe spirit and intent of the law.<\/p>\n<p>In Bowers <em>vs.<\/em> Smith (111 Mo., 45; 16 L. R. A., 754), the court said: \n\"If the law itself declares a specified irregularity to be fatal, the courts \nwill follow that command irrespective of their views of the importance of the \nrequirement. (Led-better <em>vs.<\/em> Hall, 62 Mo., 422.) In the absence of such \ndeclaration, the judiciary endeavor, as best they may, to discern whether the \ndeviation from the prescribed forms of law had, or had not, so vital an \ninfluence on the proceedings as probably prevented a free and full expression of \nthe popular will. If it had, the irregularity is held to vitiate the entire \nreturn; otherwise, it is considered immaterial.\" In Kenworthy vs. Mast (141 \nCal., 268), it was said: \"It is practically impossible to lay down any general \nrule covering all cases, but we think the true test to be applied to departures \nfrom the requirements of the laws relating to the conducting of elections on the \nproper day and at the proper place, be those requirements called mandatory or \ndirectory, is as to whether or not the particular departure is of such a nature \nas to make it impossible or extremely difficult to determine, under the \ncircumstances of the case, whether fraud has been committed or anything done \nwhich would affect the result.\"<\/p>\n<p>In Atkinson <em>vs.<\/em> Lorbeer (111 Cal., 419), it was said: \"Election \ncontests arising out of irregularities of election officers frequently present \nto courts the alternative of either setting aside in the case in hand the honest \nand clear expression of the will of the majority of the voters, or of so \nconstruing the election laws as to open the door to future frauds which it is \nthe purpose of those laws to prevent. Of course, neither the voters nor those \nvoted for have any control over election officers; and to set aside the vote of \na precinct, <em>when there was clearly no fraud or any mistake affecting the \nresult,<\/em> for mere irregularities occasioned by the ignorance or carelessness \nof election boards would in many cases be a patent injustice. Moreover, a \nconstruction requiring an exceedingly strict compliance with all statutory \nprovisions might tempt to irregularities contrived for the very purpose of \nvitiating the vote at a certain polling place, and, as was said in Whipley \n<em>vs.<\/em> McKune (12 Cal., 361), 'might lead to more fraud than it would \nprevent. On the other hand, statutory provisions which are clearly mandatory \nmust be substantially complied with; and even directory provisions cannot be so \ngrossly departed from as to make it impossible or extremely difficult to \ndetermine whether fraud had been committed or anything done which would affect \nthe result.\"<\/p>\n<p>A statement of the rule in Jones <em>vs.<\/em> State (153 Ind., 440), by the \nsupreme court of Indiana has often been quoted with approval: \"All provisions of \nthe election law are mandatory if enforcement is sought before election in a \ndirect proceeding for that purpose; but after election, all should be held \ndirectory only, in support of the result, unless of a character to effect an \nobstruction to the free and intelligent casting of the vote, or to the \nascertainment of the result, or unless the provisions affect an essential \nelement of the election, or unless it is expressly declared by the statute that \nthe particular act is essential to the validity of an election, or that its \nomission shall render it void.\"<\/p>\n<p>These general rules have been frequently applied. In Choisser vs. York (211 \n111., 56), the returns from one precinct were not signed by the judges and \nclerks of election, as required by law. Proclamation of the results was made in \nonly two out of fifteen precincts. In another precinct the judges of election \ndid not appear, and three persons constituted themselves judges and proceeded to \nhold the election. There was an entire absence of fraud or intimidation in the \nconduct of the election, and it was held that these being mere irregularities \nwhich did not prevent or subvert a free and honest expression of the popular \nwill, should not be allowed to vitiate the returns.<\/p>\n<p>Initials of poll clerks indorsed upon the lower right hand corner on the back \nof the ballots instead of on the lower left hand corner as prescribed by law \nwere held not to render the ballots invalid, the court saying that the error was \nan innocent and honest mistake of the officers. (Parvin <em>vs.<\/em> Wimberg, \n130 Ind., 561; 15 L. R. A., 775; 30 Am. St. Rep., 254.)<\/p>\n<p>In Montgomery<em> vs.<\/em> Henry (144 Ala., 629; 1 L. R.

The \ncourt ordered that the returns should not be canvassed for the reason that the \nchange was unauthorized and that it was therefore the duty of the election \ninspectors to show that the change was made in good faith, without fraud, and \nwith no intent to injure the cause of respondents, and that in fact no one was \nthereby deprived of his vote. (Citing Whitcomb <em>vs.<\/em> Chase, 83 Neb., 360; \n17 Ann.

W., \n570), the returns were announced and the box then locked and, in a manner, \nsealed, though not in accordance with law. During the canvass the unused ballots \nwere passed around to keep tally on and not returned to the township clerk. No \ncertified statement of the result was prepared the night the canvass was made, \nand the ballot box was left unguarded in the town hall during the night. The \nnext morning the defeated candidate appeared and orally asked for a recount, \nalthough by law such a request was required to be m writing, accompanied by a \ndeposit. The inspectors acceded to the request, and proceeded to recount the \nballots, the candidate in question and his brother assisting and advising. Their \ncount gave this candidate a small plurality. Although there was no showing of \nfraud, it was held that these irregularities were so prominent as to necessitate \na return to the figures originally given out by the board.<\/p>\n<p>In Perry <em>vs.<\/em> Hackney (11 N. D., 148), through a misinterpretation of \nthe law relating to the construction of the booths, they were built in exactly \nthe same manner as were the booths in the municipality of Camiling, except that \nthe writing1 shelf was placed against the back of the booth, so that the voter's \nbody and the sides of the booth prevented anyone passing along the line of \nbooths from seeing the ballot while it was being marked. There was also a row of \nschool desks used as a guard rail in front of the booths, although they were not \n10 feet from the booths as required by law. There was not even an allegation of \nany fraud or intimidation in the conduct of the election. The court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Not only do the findings show that the omissions had no effect upon the \nstate of the vote, but they also show that the electors in Cheyenne precinct had \na secret ballot within the meaning and spirit of the law. It is true, the \nstatutory mode of guarding its secrecy was not strictly obeyed; that is, the \nvoter was not screened from observation when marking his ballot in the manner \ncontemplated by the statute, and the guard rails were not 10 feet from the \nballot boxes and booths. But these are mere means of securing a secret ballot, \nwhich is the end aimed at, and when that is accomplished the spirit and purpose \nof the law has been accomplished. By reference to the findings before set out, \nit will be seen that, while the body of the voter was in full view when in the \nbooth, his ballot, when laid across the shelf in the booth for marking, was \nconcealed by his body and the sides of the booth. He was able to mark his ballot \nscreened from observation, and it does not appear that any ballots were marked \notherwise than in secret. To hold that this election was not by secret ballot \nwould be, in our opinion, to subordinate substance to form, and to hold that the \nmeans, and not the end, is of permanent importance.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It will be noted that the court emphasized the fact that the booths so far \ncomplied with the law that the voter was not prevented from marking his ballot \nin secret It can well be doubted if the returns would have been upheld, even \nthough it appeared that the election was conducted without fraud, had the \ninspectors provided no guard rail and had placed the writing shelf facing the \nside of the booth instead of the rear, so that a person passing along the row of \nbooths could easily see how the ballot was being marked.<\/p>\n<p>In Choisser <em>vs.<\/em> York (211 111., 56; cited <em>supra<\/em>), the \njudges of election in one precinct did not appear and three persons constituted \nthemselves judges and proceeded to hold the election. There were only three \nbooths, an insufficient number, and for that reason some of the ballots were \nmarked in a small adjoining room. The authorized register of voters was not used \nbut it was not shown that any illegal votes were cast in consequence of the \nabsence of the register. The court upheld the results with the exception of the \nvotes which were marked in the small adjoining room on the ground that there had \nbeen no fraud in the conduct of the election.<\/p>\n<p>As to these votes, however, the court said: \"This provision of the statute \n(relating to the construction of booths) is an important one, and should not be \ndisregarded. It has been held that a failure of election officers to erect \nbooths in compliance with law was an irregularity which would not vitiate the \nelection. (Moyer <em>vs.<\/em> Van de Vanter, 12 Wash., 377; 50 Am. St. Reps., \n900.) We are of the opinion, however, that this statute is so far mandatory that \nit must be substantially complied with. To permit a room adjoining the room in \nwhich the election is held to be used as a booth, would open wide the door for \nfraud by permitting unauthorized persons to have access to the voter and it \nwould substantially destroy the seclusion of a citizen while preparing his \nballot\u2014at least such might be the result.\"<\/p>\n<p>In Banks <em>vs.<\/em> Sergent (104 Ky., 843), about 75 voters in one precinct \nhad their ballots marked on the table by some officers of election without any \ndisability being shown and without swearing the voter. The proof showed that the \nvoter would be furnished with a card or slip of paper, when he entered the \npolling station, containing the names of the parties he desired to vote for, and \nthat on presenting this card one of the election officers would read it aloud \nwhile another would mark the ballot. Booths were placed near a window with the \nwindow lights out and near large cracks in the house, it being a log house. When \na voter went into a booth persons outside could see how he was marking the \nballot. Of this precinct the court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It was in no sense a secret ballot. The secrecy of the ballot is a \nfundamental idea of all elections, and this is required by the constitution as \nwell as by statute. This central idea being disregarded in this precinct, and a \npractical <em>viva voce<\/em> election held, as the proof shows, we are of \nopinion that the returns therefrom should be disregarded.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Contrast the above cases, in which there was no charge of fraud or \nintimidation on the part of anyone, with the following cases, where the \ninspectors of election were guilty of fraudulent practices.<br\/><br\/>In State \n<em>vs.<\/em> Malo (42 Kan., 54), the election board willfully refused to issue a \nstatement, immediately after the polls closed of the number of votes polled, as \nrequired by law; they refused to permit any of the opposing party to be present \nin the polling station during the reception of the votes, as required by law; \nand indulged in many other fraudulent practices. The court said: \"In a word, \nevery provision of the statutes of this State made for the purpose of preventing \nfraudulent and corrupt practices in the conduct and result of elections was \nwantonly disregarded by the election boards in Cimarron and Foote townships, and \nby the clerk of the county, and by all the officers whose duty it was to see \nthat a free and fair election was held and an honest count had. These repeated \nomissions of duty and willful violations of positive requirements were not the \nresult of ignorance or carelessness, but were produced by a settled \ndetermination to carry the election in favor of Cimarron by any means and at all \nhazards.\"<\/p>\n<p>In Rhodes <em>vs.<\/em> Driver (69 Ark., 501), persons were permitted to vote \nwho had not paid their poll taxes; votes of two persons known to one of the \njudges to be dead were received; twelve were recorded as voting who swore they \ndid not vote; four were recorded as voting who were not in the township; sixteen \nrecorded as voting could not be found in the township; and all of the above \nvotes were for the contestees. The officers of election were strong partisans of \nthe contestees. There was evidence that the original poll lists were destroyed \nand others substituted. These frauds on the part of the election board were held \nto vitiate the election.<\/p>\n<p>In Attorney-General <em>vs.<\/em> McQuade (94 Mich., 439), which was before \nthe court on a demurrer to the complaint, it was alleged that the chairman of \nthe election board deposited 13 ballots of unregistered persons in the ballot \nbox; about seventy-five exposed their ballots after being marked; and the \nchairman refused to swear an inspector for the purpose of marking ballots of \nilliterate voters as required by law. The court said: \"If an inspector or other \nperson be permitted to enter the booths with the voters, the danger is far \ngreater than under the old system, where there was some opportunity to see and \ndetect fraud. Under this practice, venal voting could readily be accomplished. \nThe law is designed to secure absolute secrecy to the elector, and thus prevent \nall opportunity for corrupt practices. The law does not permit parties to profit \nby such frauds, though they may not have participated in the fraud.\"<\/p>\n<p>In Vigil vs. Garcia (36 Colo., 430), one of the judges frequently left the \npolling place, and an unsworn substitute took his place, the judge in question \nbecoming so intoxicated that he was incapacitated and was compelled to sleep \nduring a considerable portion of the time the votes were being counted; he \nrefused to assist an illiterate and told the other judges to assist him and be \nsure and vote him against two prominent candidates; alleged illiterates were \nassisted without affidavits of their illiteracy; the ballots were counted in a \nlarge part by unauthorized persons; and many people voting were seen in the \nprecinct only a few days before and not after the election. These incidents \ncaused the court to void the returns.<\/p>\n<p>In Freeman <em>vs.<\/em> Lazarus (61 Ark., 247), where the returns were thrown \nout, it was established that the judges of election electioneered with voters in \nthe booths, and urged them to allow such judges to prepare their ballots; that a \nlarge number of ballots were prepared by one judge instead of two as required by \nthe statute; that they were prepared directly contrary to the express wish of \nthe voters and were returned to them folded. The court reviewed the law as to \nthe construction of the booths and non-interference with the elector while he \nwas prepaying his ballot, saying that all these were stringent provisions \nintended to guard the voter against interference or influence while preparing \nhis ballot and that it was the intention of the Legislature by these means to \nfree the voter from all extraneous influence, and to make his ballot an \nexpression of his own will.<\/p>\n<p>In Orr <em>vs.<\/em> Kevil (100 S. W., 314, Ky. Ct. App.) 18 ballots were \nmarked by voters who had been bribed, a fact of which the election inspectors \nwere cognizant; 26 ballots were found in the box which did not bear the clerk's \nname upon their backs, and upon three of these being unfolded and found to be \nRepublican votes, objection was made to opening any more. Upon trial these 26 \nballots could not be found. The law provided that where it appeared from an \ninspection of the whole record there was such fraud and bribery in the conduct \nof the election that no one could be said to have been fairly elected, the \nreturns should be thrown out. This provision of law was held applicable and the \nreturns from that precinct ordered thrown out, the court saying: \"An election \nofficer who so far forgets the sanctity of his oath as to participate in one \nkind of fraud at an election, can readily be believed to be willing to commit \nany other which the necessity of his party requires, and the opportunity of his \nposition permits. It requires little knowledge of the methods of election frauds \nin modern times to appreciate how easily a close election could be turned by a \nshifty and resourceful clerk omittinghis name from the backs of the ballots of \nignorant and unwary voters, if this would suffice for the accomplishment of the \nevil design.\"<\/p>\n<p>In Russell <em>vs.<\/em> State (11 Kan., 236), the court said in part: \"Now \ncomes the contestant and says that the record (of the election board) is a lie, \nand proves that 127 of the names so recorded as the names of legal voters are \nfictitious, and that 127 spurious ballots were cast into the ballot box. In \nother words, he proves absolutely that nearly one-fourth of this record is \nfalse. And this falsehood cannot have been the result of ignorance or mistake. \nIt is not possible that this could have happened without the knowledge, consent, \nand connivance of both the clerks, and some, at least, if not all, of the \njudges. Surely, there was criminal culpability if not actual, intentional \nwrong-doing on the part of all the officers of that election board. But, says \nthe contestee, the whole record is not shown to be false. Reject the 127 votes \nproved to have been spurious, and accept the balance not thus proven. In other \nwords, accept all of the record not proved untrue. If the falsehood resulted \nfrom mere mistake, there would be great force in this demand. So also, if the \nfalsehood resulted from the fraud or wrong-doing of others than the board. But \nwhere\u00bb the recording officers are proved to have knowingly made a largely false \nand fraudulent record, how can we place reliance on any of the record? \n<em>Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus.<\/em> * * *<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It doubtless happens that some legal voters are by this decision deprived of \nthe benefit of their votes. Perhaps there were honest votes cast, enough to have \ngiven the majority to Fredonia. A large majority of the citizens of Fredonia are \nhonest men, were ignorant of the fraud which was being perpetrated, and are \ndoubtless as much grieved as we at this terrible trespass on the purity of the \nballot box. May this example preach its lesson, not alone to them, but equally \nto every citizen of the State. They who in Rome watched and kept the sacred fire \nwere vestal virgins. Equally pure should they be who watch and guard that which \nis far more to us than mystic altar fires.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The contrast between the two lines of cases is most marked. Where it has been \nestablished that a fair and honest election was held, none but the gravest \nirregularities will avoid the election: such as might be said to raise a \npresumption of fraud. But where the election board has committed irregularities \n<em>fraudulently,<\/em> they need not be serious or numerous. The position and \nduties of an election board is one where much must be left to the honesty and \nintegrity of its members. Many of its acts must be accepted as true even though \nfalse, for the reason that no adequate proof can be secured of their falsity. \nThe law has, however, outlined its duties with some care; and fraudulent \npractices kept within bounds can not, as a rule, assume large proportions. Nor \ncan fraud be practiced in many directions without asserting itself at some point \nor other. So that from the very difficulty of following all the movements of the \nboard, a grave suspicion immediately arises as to its honesty of purpose when \nonce a fraud chargeable to it has been discovered. The thought immediately \nsuggests itself, if fraud was committed here, it is probable that it was also \ncommitted there, where it can not be proved except by the confession of the \ninspectors themselves. The general rule is that a witness proved a willful \nfalsifier on a material point is thoroughly discredited. The same rule should \napply to the record made by an election board. It is <em>prima facie<\/em> \nevidence of the results of the election, backed by the familiar presumption that \npublic officials have done their duty. But once it is proved fraudulent <em>in \nan important particular,<\/em> the party claiming under it should be put to his \nproofs. Such is the rule, more strongly stated, however, by McCrary on \nElections, sec. 541 <em>et seq:<\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The safe rule, probably, is that where an election board are found to have \nwillfully and deliberately committed a fraud, even though it affect a number of \nvotes too small to change the result, it is sufficient to destroy all confidence \nin their official acts, and to put the party claiming anything under the \nelection conducted by them to the proof of his votes by evidence other than the \nreturn.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And he declares the same rule applicable when the integrity of the returns is \ndestroyed by misconduct of the officials, consisting in \"a reckless disregard of \nthe law, or in ignorance of its requirements\" though no corrupt purpose be \naffirmatively shown. (Id., sec. 540.) (And see Londoner <em>vs.<\/em> People, 15 \nColo., 557.)<\/p>\n<p>Such are, we believe, the principles which govern the case at bar. The \nquestions we are called upon to decide are: Were there mere irregularities in \nthe conduct of the election in the five several precincts of Camiling? If so, \nwere these irregularities of so serious a character as to be ascribed to \ninexcusable ignorance or a reckless disregard of the law? Were there fraudulent \npractices in the conduct of the election? Were threats and intimidation employed \nof a character serious enough to intimidate and coerce the electors?<\/p>\n<p>Were we confronted with the bare proposition that the polling stations were \nlocated on the second floor and that the 30-meter space around them was not kept \nclear, it might be that we should not have taken the drastic step of avoiding \nthe returns from this municipality. The law directs that these things be done, \nbut it does not say that the fact that they were not done shall have the effect \nof vitiating the returns, and unless the nonobservance of the law in this \nrespect was made a means of fraud or coercion they should be considered as \nharmless irregularities.<\/p>\n<p>But the failure to provide booths according to law is of a more serious \ncharacter. The central idea of the Australian ballot law, as so often expressed \nin the cases, is to shroud the marking of the ballots in absolute secrecy. All \nthe efforts to secure a free and untrammeled expression of the elector's will \nlead up to and depart from that point. If the plan fails in this particular, it \nis worse than useless to have him register his vote on a slip of paper and \nrequire the election board to go through the arduous task of compiling and \nascertaining the result from numbers of such slips. The voting booths in the \nfive precincts of Camiling in nosense of the word insured a secret ballot. The \nmost superficial study of the Election Law should demonstrate that the central \nidea is to prevent any other person than the voter from knowing how he marks his \nballot And the most ordinary intellect could not fail to observe that open \nbooths, unprovided with a guard rail, and with the writing shelves facing the \nsides of the booths would leave but a mere shadow of the absolute and \nimpenetrable secrecy which a strict compliance with the law affords the voter. \nNo explanation of this gross disregard of the law has been made. It has not even \nbeen alleged that it was due to ignorance or a misunderstanding of the law. \nIndeed, it would be difficult to believe that the importance of affording the \nelector a secret ballot should be so far misunderstood as not only to fail to \nprovide booths with doors and guard rails, <em>but also to place the writing \ndesks so that they faced the sides of the booths.<\/em> The combination of the \nthree circumstances suggests strongly that it was due to design rather than to \nmistake or ignorance.<\/p>\n<p>But it is unnecessary to base our decision in this case on the faulty \nconditions obtaining in the polling stations. The inspectors of the first, \nsecond, third, and fifth precincts have been conclusively shown to have returned \na fraudulent list of illiterates. The same list prepared by the inspectors of \nthe fourth precinct is also inaccurate, and the certainty of their dishonesty is \nonly lessened by the reduction of the discrepancy. For this discrepancy the \nelection inspectors of this precinct offer no explanation, and none has been \nsuggested which, to our view, is reasonable. Ballots unaccountably disappeared \nafter the blanks had arrived at the municipality of Camiling, and no adequate \nsystem of marking the remaining supply was adopted, and even this was not \nuniformly adopted. Charges of threats made within the 30-meter limit, and in \nsome instances, within the very building where the polling station was located, \nappear to be well founded. Besides these matters, applicable to all the \nprecincts, various incidents\u2014straws, as it were, indicating the direction of the \ncurrent\u2014have been proved to have occurred in particular precincts, which it is \nnot necessary again to recall. A threat as the voter entered the polling \nstation, and the espionage of a zealous partisan while the ballot was being \nmarked doubtless caused many a voter of peaceful tendencies to succumb to such \nstrong-arm methods, and to finish the disagreeable business as soon as possible. \nHow many such votes were thus obtained it is, of course, impossible to tell. \nSuch methods are not confined to particular ballots, easily distinguishable \nduring the canvass of the votes. They are diffusive: to locate their triumphs is \nimpossible. Nevertheless, votes so obtained are as fraudulent as particular \nballots containing identification marks, which are conclusively presumed to be \nfraudulent. The latter, when discovered, are simply not counted. They have no \nother effect on the results. It is just as desirable that votes obtained through \ncoercive methods should not be counted, but being incapable of detection it has \nbeen necessary to adopt a more heroic treatment. The courts have therefore laid \ndown the rule that when fraudulent votes are so mixed up with honest votes that \nit cannot be determined how many are honest and how many are fraudulent, the \nreturns shall be destroyed. (State <em>vs.<\/em> Fulton, 42 Kan., 164.)<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is not necessary to show that a majority were actually prevented from \nvoting, or voted against their wishes by reason of the practice (intimidation). \nWhen the wrong is flagrant and its influence diffusive, it is sufficient that it \nrenders the result doubtful.\" (Jones <em>vs.<\/em> Glidewell, 53 Ark., 161; 7 L. \nR. A., 831.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In Martin <em>vs.<\/em> McGarr (27 Okla., 653), it was said: \"While a \ncontestant in an election may always object to the counting and consideration of \nfraudulent or illegal votes, yet the reception of the same will in no instance \nresult in the avoidance of the election except where the entire poll is so \ntainted that the good votes cannot be separated from the bad, and it is \nimpossible to ascertain for whom the majority of the valid ballots were cast. \nThe general rule obtaining throughout all the States of the Union is that an \nelection is not to be held invalid except as a last resort, the correct doctrine \nbeing announced by Judge Brewster, in the case of Batturs vs. McGary (1 \nBrewster, 162), as follows: The courts have the power to reject the entire poll, \nbut only in the extremest case\u2014as where it is impossible to ascertain the true \nvote. Impossibility is the test.'\"<\/p>\n<p>In Hardy <em>vs.<\/em> Beaver City (125 Pac, 679), it was said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Where an election takes place which is held or conducted in violation of \nsome express constitutional or statutory provision, or where through some act of \ncommission or omission prohibited by law on the part of the voters or some of \nthem, the result of an election is affected, or if it be shown that fraud, \nintimidation or other illegal methods were practiced, then an election cannot \nstand.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>These are the grounds upon which we rejected the returns from the five \nprecincts of the municipality of Camiling: a fatal flaw in the conduct of the \nelection, accompanied by frauds on the part of the election officials, and \nintimidation of voters.<\/p>\n<p>In concluding this extremely disagreeable task, we desire to state that we \nare aware of the seriousness of disfranchising the innocent electors of a whole \nprecinct for acts done by others. We are not unmindful of the force of \ntheargument that if courts set aside the returns from a precinct for light and \ntrifling causes, it will encourage the unscrupulous to seek profit by the honest \nmistakes of election officers committed in the conscientious performance of \ntheir duties. On the other hand we appreciate the importance to the people of \nenforcing those statutory provisions which the legislature have provided to \ninsure a free and undefiled expression of the popular will at the polls, to the \nextent that fraud may not flourish under the guise of honesty. The right of \nsuffrage is of comparatively recent origin in this country. If at this early \nstage of its existence, the courts are to countenance such bold disregard of the \nlaw as was exhibited in the municipality of Camiling at the last general \nelection, representative government will soon become a farce; a mere catchword \nor an empty illusion. Regardless of the political unrest engendered by such \ndeplorable litigation as the present and its enormous expense to the \ncontestants, we are of the opinion that a firm stand against fraudulent \nelections must now be taken, once for all. If no encouragement is offered to \nvicious practices, they will, at least, never grow larger.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<hr align=\"left\" no=\"\" shade=\"\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<p align=\"right\"><br\/><br\/><span class=\"style1\"><sup>[1]<\/sup><\/span> OCTOBER 31, \n1913.<\/p>\n<p>The trial court found that the protestee, Romulo, received a plurality of 138 \nvotes.

This letter was \nfound by Rafaela Coronel, who was living with Dolores, in the fence around her \nhouse, and as she was then on her way to church she turned it over to her \nneighbor Agustin Coronel, who read its contents to Dolores Coronel, an old woman \nof 70 years, who became nervous and uneasy upon seeing herself thus threatened. \nTito Coronel reported the matter to the municipal president of Guagua, Pampanga, \nwho went to Dolores' house and adopted some precautionary measures. Upon \nreturning to the town hall he found a man held under arrest by the Constabulary. \nHe had him searched to see whether he was carrying any prohibited thing and \nthere was found upon him an envelope inside a pocketbook, and upon the envelope \nwas written the name of Dolores Coronel. The man under arrest was Sofronio de la \nCruz.\n<p>The letter with its envelope, found in the fence around the house, forms \nExhibit A. The envelope found in the pocketbook, Exhibit B.<\/p>\n<p>On this envelope (Exhibit B) the name written is \"Dolores Cronel\" and the \nletter and envelope (Exhibit A) also set forth the same name, \"Dolores Cronel.\" \nIt is sufficient to compare the nature of the handwriting of the name \"Dolores \nCronel\" on the envelope (Exhibit B) with that of the same writing used in the \nletter (Exhibit A) in order to appreciate at a glance their complete \nsimilarity.<\/p>\n<p>Sofronio de la Cruz had been arrested by the Constabulary and taken to the \ntown hall for a similar letter, addressed, apparently, to one Andres Valenzuela \nof the same neighborhood of Guagua, which has been brought into this case as \nExhibit C. A glance at it corroborates the idea that both letters were written \nby the same hand.<\/p>\n<p>Sofronio de la Cruz says that Tito Coronel wrote the name \"Dolores Cronel\" \nthat appears on the envelope found on him; but Tito Coronel was made to write a \nname in court for comparing his handwriting, and it is evident that this is not \nat all like that of any of the letters that figure as exhibits in the case.<\/p>\n<p>In connection with this phase of the defense the defendant presented the \nwitness Florentino Nacu to demonstrate that the old woman Dolores Coronel had \nbeen in his house, accompanied by Tito Coronel, for the purpose of talking about \nplowpoints with the defendant, and that the latter made a note of her name in \norder to know her address, and Tito Coronel wrote the name \"Dolores Cronel\" on \nthe envelope (Exhibit B); that the defendant remained iii Florentino Nacu's \nhouse until Good Friday (on which day the letter addressed to Dolores Coronel \nwas found); that he was in said house to collect from Nacu what the latter owed \nhim; that on the Wednesday previous he had urged Nacu to get some money because \nhe needed it badly. Florentino Nacu testified in agreement, but to all this said \nthat while the old woman Dolores and the defendant were talking about plowpoints \nhe was in the kitchen cooking the food for his family and gave his attention to \nthat, although he was moving in and out where Dolores and Tito Coronel were \ntalking with the defendant, but still he did not affirm that he had seen Tito \nCoronel write on the envelope thathe handed the defendant. Tito Coronel totally \ndenies all the assertions of the defendant and his witness Nacu.<\/p>\n<p>The Court of First Instance of Pampanga sentenced the defendant, as guilty of \nthreats, under article 494 of the Penal Code, to four years two months and one \nday of <em>prision correccional,<\/em> the accessories of the law, with credit \nfor half the time of detention suffered, and to payment of the costs.<\/p>\n<p>The first ground of error assigned to us is the denial of the motion for \ndismissal presented by the defense after the evidence for the prosecution had \nbeen closed and before that for the defense had been begun, the motion being \nbased upon lack of evidence.<\/p>\n<p>The Attorney-General in this instance alleges that the question has already \nbeen determined by this Supreme Court in a negative sense in the case of the \nUnited States <em>vs.<\/em> Abaroa (3 Phil. Rep., 116), wherein the following \nprinciple was laid down: \"After the prosecution rests, the court should not \ndismiss the case on motion for insufficiency of proof but should require the \ndefendant to present evidence on his own behalf.\"<\/p>\n<p>This is true. But this decision was rendered on December 29, 1903, when, in \nconformity with General Order No. 58, it was possible to appeal from dismissals \nand final judgments. It was then held that the practice of dismissing the case \nimmediately after the evidence for the prosecution had been closed ought not to \nbe followed, for when the order of dismissal was appealed from and this higher \ncourt sustained the conviction of the accused on that evidence of the \nprosecution he would have been convicted without having been heard in his own \ndefense, which would work an injustice; and when to avoid this difficulty the \norder of dismissal was overruled and the case returned for rehearing, another \ndifficulty would be encountered, which is that of subjecting the accused a \nsecond time to another trial without action on his part and without need, since \nall the evidence could and should have been taken at the trial already held, and \nwith the additional risk of all the inconveniences of delay. In this state of \naffairs the Supreme Court of the United States rendered the decision in the case \nof Kepner <em>vs.<\/em> U. S. (195 U. S., 100; 11 Phil. Rep., 669), and since \nthen the situation assumed and disposed of in United States vs. Abaroa cannot be \nconsidered, for the Government cannot now appeal from an order sustaining the \nmotion to dismiss presented by the defense after the evidence for the \nprosecution has been closed, on the ground of insufficiency thereof.<\/p>\n<p>Even now, after the Kepner case, it is no ground for error that the Court of \nFirst Instance denied the motion for dismissal presented immediately after the \nevidence for the prosecution had been closed because the defense believed it to \nbe insufficient; for the reason that, as in this case, the court did not hold it \nto be insufficient\u2014it was under no obligation so to hold it\u2014and it could \ncontinue the trial and take the evidence for the defense in order to reach the \nconclusion induced, in its opinion by the allegations and the evidence, or as it \ndid conclude in this case by sentencing the defendant on the evidence for the \nprosecution, which it held to be sufficient. <\/p>\n<p>And it is quite sufficient, as the trial court has held, even taking into \nconsideration only the exhibits. <\/p>\n<p>One of the methods of proving the authenticity of a writing is collation, the \ncomparison the court can make with other writings proven to its satisfaction to \nbe authentic. The trial court held to be proven to its satisfaction as authentic \nthe writing by the defendant (Exhibit B) that was found inside the pocketbook. \nThe defendant tried to ascribe the writing to another\u2014to Tito Coronel:\u2014and his \ncounsel tested Tito Coronel by having him write in the court room what he \ndictated to him. He directed him to write the name of a person and of a place as \nthe address of a letter, and it plainly appears that neither the free \nhandwriting of the letter nor the firmness of the strokes of the writing is at \nall like the somewhat rough and uncertain form, as of a beginner, of the writing \nand strokes in Exhibit B and the anonymous Exhibits A and C. These are signed in \nthe same way with a \"Pulano Tal\" so similar that it seems to be one signature \ntraced over the other. Moreover, Tito Coronel, said to be an intimate of the old \nwoman Dolores Coronel, if he had really written her name in order thus to give \nthe defendant a definite post-office address, when he knew so well how to write, \nas he demonstrated, would not have written Dolores <em>Cronel,<\/em> as it \nappears in Exhibits A and B. Furthermore, the initial <em>\"D\"<\/em> of the name \n<em>Dolores<\/em> and the same unusual way of writing the \"D\" in the Exhibits A \nand C is not the \"D\" written by Tito Coronel in the word \"Dumaguete,\" which he \nwas made to write. The attempt to ascribe to Tito Coronel the writing of the \nname that appears in Exhibit B was frustrated. \"I wish to prove,\" said the \nwitness Pedro Bacani, municipal president, \"that the witness Tito Coronel is an \ninfluential man, and not, as the defense is trying, to prove indirectly that it \nwas Tito Coronel who wrote the letter.\" The defense: \"From the moment we \npresented him as a witness, we ceased to suspect him. We admit that Tito Coronel \nis an influential man.\" (p. 50.) <\/p>\n<p>The trial court having held that the anonymous threat (Exhibit A) was written \nby the defendant, and there being no ground for the contrary, the legitimate \nconclusion from the facts is to sustain such finding, which is certainly \ncorroborated by the other data furnished by the witness Florentino Nacu \nregarding the presence in Guagua of the defendant, who was a resident of Angat, \nBulacan.<\/p>\n<p>The conclusion in law therefore is for the guilt of the defendant, who is \nguilty of the crime penalized in paragraph one of article 494 of the Penal Code; \nand there must be imposed upon him the penalty lower by two degrees than that \nfixed by the law for the crime he threatened to commit. For having made the \nthreat and demanding a sum of money, even though he did not obtain it, the \npenalty should be in the maximum degree, however, as he made the threat in \nwriting. The penalty fixed by the law for the crime Tie threatened to commit, \nwhich is homicide, is <em>reclusion temporal <\/em>(art. 404), so the lower by \ntwo degrees, according to scale No. 2, is <em>prision correccional,<\/em> which \nin its maximum degree is four years two months and one day to six years. The \npenalty of four years two months and one day of <em>prision correccional<\/em> in \nthe judgment appealed from being in this degree and the imposition of the \naccessories of the law and the allowance of half of the time of detention \nsuffered and the payment of the costs all being proper, said judgment is \naffirmed, with the costs of this instance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><em>Moreland, J.,<\/em> concurs in the result.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

The young lady being \nill, priones, from his window, called to the accused and asked .them not to \ncontinue the serenade as he was afraid the music would awaken herl The accused \nthereupon departed. About 2 o'clock of the afternoon of the following day \nBriones, riding a carabao, went to visit a piece of land belonging to him in \nMaabu. During the journey he had to cross a dry run which, in the wet season, \nemptied its waters into the Patay-na-tubig River. Briones had crossed this run \nand was in the act of ascending the opposite bank when suddenly the three \naccused, Roman Maghirang, Francisco Gutierrez, and Damaso Rivera, leaped from \nthe bushes in which they were hidden. Gutierrez seized the carabao while Rivera \nstruck Briones on the left arm with a club. The force of the blow knocked \nBriones to the ground. While down, Maghirang approached him with a bolo and, in \nspite of the remonstrances and prayers of Briones, struck him two blows, one on \nthe shoulder and the other across the lips. The accused then withdrew. The blows \nwere heavy ones and rendered the victim senseless. After returning to \nconsciousness he was able, with great difficulty, to reach his house.<\/p>\n<p>According to the testimony of the physician who examined Briones after the \nassault, the wound on the shoulder was about 18 centimeters long and, at the \npoint of greatest profundity, 4 to 5 centimeters deep. The wound cut through all \nof the muscles of the shoulder, through the capsular ligament, and into the bone \na distance of 2\u00a3 centimeters. The arm has lost about 60 per cent of its strength \nand usefulness, and Briones is unable, and will be unable, to engage in his \nusual occupation. This injury is permanent.<\/p>\n<p>The second wound, the one across the mouth, intersected both lips. The upper \nlip was cut away in part, while a portion cut from the lower lip was still \nhanging by a small portion of the skin when first seen by a doctor. Attempts \nwere made by the surgeon to sew this piece to the lower lip. He finally \nsucceeded and, although the parts have grown together, the lower lip is \nparalyzed and Briones is able to speak only by placing his hand against the \nlower lip and holding it in position while he articulates. <\/p>\n<p>These injuries were cured, so far as cure was possible, in about forty days \nat an expense of P300.<\/p>\n<p>From the evidence in this case we have no doubt whatever that the accused are \nguilty of the acts charged in the information. Briones recognized all three as \nthey attacked him and detailed clearly and satisfactorily what each one did. The \nonly question calling for discussion in this case is one raised by the private \nprosecutor, who insists that the solicitor-general, in this court, has not \nproperly qualified the crime, the latter insisting that the crime is lesiones \ngraves instead of frustrated murder.<\/p>\n<p>In support of his contention that the crime is <em>lesiones graves<\/em> and \nnot frustrated murder, the solicitor-general says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The trial court found that the crime committed was frustrated murder, with \nthe aggravating circumstance of premeditation.<\/p>\n<p>\"There exist, it is true, certain circumstances which appear to sustain this \nconclusion of the court: The. use of bolos, which in themselves are deadly \nweapons; the words 'we are going to kill you\u2019 which Maghirang used to Briones \nwhen the attack was made, and which were followed immediately by the blow across \nthe face; the ambush and the unexpected and sudden assault, all appear to \nsustain the contention that there was an intention to kill, induced as the trial \ncourt said, by the insult which they supposed had been offered them the night \nbefore.<\/p>\n<p>\"But an examination of the doctrine of this court in the cases of U. S. \n<em>vs.<\/em> Duruelo (7 Phil Rep., 497) ; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Trinidad (4 Phil. \nRep., 152); U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Dagalea (4 Phil. Rep., 398) ; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> \nManlalang (6 Phil. Rep., 339), induces us to to believe that the crime committed \nis that of lesiones graves (serious injuries) described and punished in \nparagraph 2, article 416 of the Penal Code, with the aggravating circumstance of \ntreachery. That is to say, although the information was for frustrated murder \nand that was the crime found by the trial court to have been committed, the \nfacts demonstrate that the accused are guilty simply of lesiones graves for the \nreason that the accusation did not prove on the trial that the intention or the \npurpose was to kill, for, although one of the accused was armed with a bolo and \nthe other with a club, and Briones lay upon the ground on his back, the wounds \ninflicted upon him were not mortal wounds, nor were they located in a fatal \nspot; and yet, in spite of that, the accused did not continue the assault in \norder to effectuate his death, nor did they use the bolo with which to deliver \nthe first blow, although they were not prevented by anybody from consummating \ntheir intention to kill him if they had had such a purpose. It is necessary to \ntake into consideration the aggravating circumstance of treachery in view of the \nfact that Briones was attacked from behind and suddenly, without having been \ngiven an opportunity to offer any resistance.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We are disposed to agree with the theory of the Solicitor General, in spite \nof the strong argument advanced by the private prosecutor, that the crime \ncommitted was really frustrated murder. According to the provisions of the Penal \nCode, article 3, \"a felony is frustrated when the offender performs all the acts \nof execution which should produce the felony as a consequence, but which, \nnevertheless, do not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of \nthe perpetrator.\"<br\/><br\/>It is clear to our minds that, in this particular case, \nthe accused did not perform \"all of the acts of execution which <em>should<\/em> \nproduce the felony as a consequence.\" The wounds were not located in a vital \nspot. Neither of them was mortal nor likely to produce death; in other words, \nthe wounds inflicted were not such as \"should\" produce death, nor such as would \nnaturally and ordinarily produce death.<\/p>\n<p>The Lim San case (17 Phil. Rep., 273) is illustrative of the conditions \nnecessary to present a case of frustrated murder. There the wound inflicted was \nsuch as \"should\" have produced death and would necessarily have produced death \nif the injured person had not been instantly taken to a hospital, his intestines \nreplaced and his abdomen properly closed. While the information charged \nattempted murder, we found the accused guilty of frustrated murder upon the \nground that he performed all of the acts which should produced death, which \nacts, nevertheless, did not produce death by reason of causes independent of the \nwill of the perpetrator. In the case before us the accused did not perform all \nof the acts necessary to produce death nor was the life of the complaining \nwitness saved by causes independent of the will of the perpetrator. In other \nwords, the accused in this case did not perform all of the acts which \"should\" \nproduce death.<\/p>\n<p>Nor is the crime attempted murder; for, in order that the crime be qualified \nas such, the offender must commence \"the commission of the felony directly by \novert acts\" but must \"not perform all of the acts of execution which constitute \nthe felony by reason of some cause or accident other than his own voluntary \ndesistance.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the case at bar the accused voluntarily desisted from injuring the victim \nfurther. They probably knew, which was the fact, that the injuries were not \ninflicted in a vital part of the body and were not such as <em>\"should\"<\/em> \nproduce death. This presents a condition from which we cannot say that the \naccused intended to kill. Without this intention the crime can be neither \nfrustrated nor attempted murder. (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Marasigan, 11 Phil. Rep., \n27; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Domingo, 18 Phil. Rep., 250; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> \nMontenegro, 15 Phil. Rep., 1; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Samea, 15 Phil.

Cang-Suco Bros, doing business in this place, a package \nthat contained the sum of P6,000, with its corresponding bill of lading, which \npackage was closed and carefully sealed, to be delivered by him personally to \nthe Chinaman Florentino Dy, of the town of Dulag, Leyte, to whom it was \naddressed; but that said accused, willfully, illegally and criminally and with \nintent of defrauding Messrs. Cang-Suco Bros., instead of delivering the said \npackage whole and complete to the said Florentino Dy, as he had received it from \nthe sender, opened it and without any authorization whatsoever abstracted \ntherefrom the sum of P2,000, all in twenty-peso bills, and appropriated the same \nto his own personal profit, to the prejudice of the said Cang-Suco Bros., in \nviolation of law.<\/p>\n<p>It was brought out at the trial instituted, that on October 21, 1913, the \nfirm of Cang-Suco Bros, of Cebu, through its representative Nicolas Eugenio, \nafter loading rice on the steamer <em>Jayme Va\u00f1o,<\/em> delivered to the \ndefendant, the navigating officer of said ship, a closed package, well-sealed at \nthe ends, containing the sum of P6,000, to be delivered to the Chinaman \nFlorentino Dy in Dulag, Leyte. The defendant issued the bill of lading, Exhibit \nA, page 12 of the record, wherein he certified that he had received from \nCang-Suco Bros, for transportation to Dulag, Leyte, 500 sacks of Saigon rice and \na package, on the cover or wrapping whereof, Exhibit B, appear the figures \nP6,000 and also some pieces of wax at,both ends. Can Sunlin, cashier of the \nCang-Suco firm, stated that he had sent to Florentino Dy exactly P6,000, wrapped \nup in the package, Exhibit B, and composed of a sheaf of bills of different \ndenominations; that when the steamer <em>Jayme Va\u00f1o<\/em> reached Dulag the \ndefendant delivered to Florentino Dy said package with a letter, but as \nFlorentino saw that the package was open at both ends he refused to receive it \nand directed the defendant to count in his presence the money contained in the \npackage, the result being that there was only P4,000, and as in the letter and \nthe bill of lading it was stated that P6,000 had been sent him, the said \nFlorentino refused to accept said sum, which the defendant took back, and upon \nhis arrival in Cebu he returned it to Cang-Suco. <\/p>\n<p>The defendant pleaded not guilty and set up no defense, but presented a \nmotion to dismiss the case on the ground that the evidence demonstrates that the \nCourt of First Instance of Cebu lacks competency to try it, for the reason that \nit was not proven that the criminal act was committed in waters in the \njurisdiction of the Province of Cebu; that there was no evidence that the \ndefendant had abstracted the sum of money stated in the complaint and that in \nany event the real parties injured would be Smith, Bell &amp; Co., and not \nCang-Suco Bros.; whereupon the court issued the order mentioned, from which the \nprovincial fiscal duly appealed.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the Government alleges in this instance that the court erred in \ndismissing the case on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, especially when it \nwas proven at the trial that the defendant received in Cebu from the firm of \nCang Suco Bros, the sum of P6,000 with the obligation of delivering it to \nFlorentino Dy in Dulag, Leyte, and that upon arrival in the port of Dulag \ninstead of delivering to Florentino Dy the sum of P6,000 he tried to deliver \nonly P4,000, alleging that he had not received more; whence it is inferred that \none of the essential acts of the crime of estafa occurred in Cebu and the other \nwas performed in Leyte, wherefore, in accordance with the ruling in the case of \nThe United States <em>vs.<\/em> Santiago (27 Phil. Rep., 408), the Court of First \nInstance of Cebu has concurrent jurisdiction with that of Leyte over the crime \nat bar.<\/p>\n<p>The complaint against Ruperto T. Santiago was filed in the Court of First \nInstance of Iloilo, because the accused Santiago, being the agent in said \nprovince of the West Coast 664 Life Insurance Company, whose central office is \nin this city of Manila, collected the premium on a certain policy in Iloilo and \nkept the sum collected instead of sending it to the company's office in Manila, \naccording to the terms of the contract. The fact that he did not deliver said \nsum to the insurance company in Manila constituted a physical act, essential to \nthe crime and necessary for its consummation, and the collection and retention \nof the sum received as a premium in Iloilo, with failure to remit it to the \ncompany in Manila, under the terms of the contract, constituted other important \nand essential acts for consummation of the crime. In view of the fact, \ntherefore, that the crime was committed partly in the Province of Iloilo and \npartly in the city of Manila, this Court held that the Court of First Instance \nof Iloilo had concurrent jurisdiction with that of Manila over the crime so \ncommitted.<\/p>\n<p>In the case at bar the facts brought out are different, for while it has been \nduly proven that the sum of P6,000 was intrusted to the defendant in Cebu to be \ndelivered to Florentino Dy in the town of Dulag, Leyte, and that upon arrival at \nsaid town the defendant tried to deliver to the said Dy the sum of P4,000 only, \nP2,000 less than the amount the defendant received, yet it has not been \ndemonstrated that the abstraction of the sum of P2,000 from the package that \ncontained the P6,000 took place within the jurisdiction of the Province of Cebu, \nfor the crime might have been committed while the ship was traveling towards \nLeyte. The fact is that the exact place where the crime of estafa was committed \nis unknown, although it is to be presumed that it was committed on shipboard in \nnavigable waters of the Philippine Archipelago, and therefore competency to try \nand decide the case lies with the Court of First Instance of any province \ntouched at by the ship or craft whereon the crime or misdemeanor is presumed to \nhave been committed. This is positively so stated in section 1 of Act No. 400, \namending section 56 of Act No, 136. In accordance with the law cited, therefore, \nthe court that has legal competency and jurisdiction to try the said penalized \nact is the Court of First Instance of Leyte, for the steamer <em>Jayme \nVa\u00f1o,<\/em> after leaving the port of Cebu, touched at the port of Dulag on said \nisland of Leyte. <\/p>\n<p>In the case of The United States <em>vs.<\/em> Dasal (3 Phil. Rep., 6), the \naccused committed the crime of murder on board a merchant steamer, registered in \nthe coastwise trade of these Islands, while anchored at the port of one of the \nislands of this Archipelago and within the navigable waters thereof. After the \ncrime had been committed, said ship entered the port of Manila, where the \naccused were arraigned, and this court, in applying the provisions of said Act \nNo. 400, decided that: \"The Court of First Instance of the port where, after the \ncommission of the crime, a ship licensed in the Philippines put in, has \njurisdiction of a crime committed aboard the ship, to the exclusion of all the \nother courts of the Archipelago.\"<\/p>\n<p>Although the package of money was received by the defendant in Cebu, the \ncrime was discovered in Dulag, Province of Leyte, where the defendant made \ndelivery of the package, already opened, containing only P4,000 of the P6,000 he \nought to have delivered to Florentino Dy; and therefore the crime of estafa was \ndiscovered and consummated in said town of Dulag, Leyte, where the defendant \nshould have fulfilled his errand. But he did not do so, nor has he explained the \nabsence of the P2,000, since the bill of lading shows that he received a package \nwhich, according to the wrapper, contained P6,000 (Exhibit A) and he did not \nlater show cause why this sum had been reduced to P4,000.<\/p>\n<p>For these reasons the order appealed from is affirmed, that is, the \ndisqualification in favor of the Court of First Instance of Leyte, at whose \ndisposition the defendant will be placed. The fiscal of said province should \nfile the corresponding complaint against the presumed perpetrator of the \ncrime.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

ELEUTERIO MANTE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The appellant was convicted of taking the oath of office as a municipal \ncouncilman and discharging the duties thereof, knowing at the time that he was \nnot qualified to hold such office, in that he was delinquent in the payment of \nhis taxes.\n<p>The prosecution introduced the appellant's oath of office, a portion of the \nminutes of a session of the municipal council showing that he had taken part \ntherein, and the official record of plaintiff's tax receipt bearing a date \nsubsequent to the other two documents, and then rested. The appellant sought to \nshow that at the time he took the oath of office and participated in a session \nof the council he was honestly of the opinion and had good reason to believe \nthat he was not delinquent in the payment of his taxes.<\/p>\n<p>Delinquency in the payment of taxes is an offense under the Election Law in \nthe case of a voter as well as of an elective officer. The sole fact of a \ndelinquency does not of itself constitute the offense, however. In each case the \nlaw requires that the defendant's <em>knowledge<\/em> of such delinquency is \nessential to his conviction. But since \"whether or not the said tax has been \npaid is something which the accused ought to know better than anyone else, said \nfact being by the very nature of the case properly within his own knowledge,\" \nproof of the delinquency carries with it the inference of knowledge thereof on \nthe part of the accused. (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Tabuyo, 19 Phil. Rep., 501.) \nConsequently, when the prosecution has proved the delinquency and the exercise \nof suffrage rights or of the assumption of official duties, as the case may be, \nit has made a prima facie case.<\/p>\n<p>Under such circumstances it devolves upon the accused at least to raise a \nreasonable doubt of his knowledge of such delinquency. The mere assertion that \nhe did not know of the delinquency in his tax payments is not sufficient to \novercome the prima facie case made by the prosecution. It is a general rule that \nwhere a statute makes a specific act penal when knowingly done and the knowledge \nof the accused cannot be directly proved but is a matter of inference, it is \nonly necessary to show that a prudent man could and would have ascertained from \navailable sources of information, that the act complained of, under the existing \ncircumstances, was contrary to law. In United States <em>vs.<\/em> Estavillo (19 \nPhil. Rep., 478), a number of delinquent taxpayers were charged with exercising \ntheir suffrage rights. Their defense was that when they took the elector's oath \nthey did not knowingly [falsely] swear that their taxes had been paid, when as a \nmatter of fact they were delinquent. On the trial they gave what this court \nconsidered insufficient excuses for their lack of knowledge. It was held in that \ncase that the defendant had not exercised due diligence in ascertaining whether \nor not their taxes were delinquent; and that had they done so they would have \ndiscovered the actual state of affairs; that is, that their taxes were \ndelinquent. The court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When it is admitted or shown, as in the case at bar, that the defendants \ncommitted the unlawful act (swearing1 that they were not delinquent, when in \nfact they were), it is presumed that they did so knowingly and intentionally. \nAnd when they seek to justify themselves by an excuse, such excuse must be \nreasonable and adequate. If it appears that they voluntarily closed their eyes \nto the truth, or negligently failed to make inquiry, then their ignorance or \nmistake of fact is not defense.<\/p>\n<p>\" 'It may fairly be assumed that one who has reason to believe a fact exists, \nknows it exists. Certainly if he be a reasonable being.' (Shaw <em>vs.<\/em> \nRailroad Co., 101 U. S., 557.)\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Conversely, if a man commits the act upon information obtained from a \nreliable source which would appeal to a reasonable man and cause him to perform \nthe act on the strength of such information, believing that circumstances \nexisted which rendered it lawful, he ought not to suffer the penalty. For it is \nnot always possible to make first-hand investigations of the existence of facts \nwhich are necessary to justify a contemplated act. If a false report of the \nexistence of a fact reaches a man through an agency which he has every reason to \nrely upon, he has a right to assume its existence, and cannot be said to \n<em>know<\/em> that it does not exist.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar the defendant \nknew that his taxes had not been paid, and was aware that the law made it a \npenal offense to take the oath of office under such circumstances. His two sons, \nboth grown men, were preparing to start for the <em>poblacion<\/em> on Friday \nmorning. He therefore gave them sufficient money to pay his taxes, together with \nhis tax receipt for the preceding year. Upon arriving at the town, the brothers \ntransacted some business. The elder brother met an old friend, and the two went \naway together to a <em>tienda<\/em> where they drank considerable <em>tuba,<\/em> \nbecoming intoxicated. This was the one who carried the tax, money and who was \nexpected to go to the municipal treasury and pay it in. The two brothers met \nlate in the afternoon and started home. The elder brother was asked by the \nyounger if he had paid their father's taxes and he answered in the affirmative. \nHe was so intoxicated that he gave his brother very little assistance in rowing \nthe boat on their way home. They arrived home about 12 o'clock at night. In the \nmeantime, their father had received a message from the municipal president \nrequesting him to come to the municipal building the next day, Saturday, to take \nthe oath of office. Accordingly, on Saturday morning the defendant prepared to \nstart for town and asked his younger son if the taxes had been paid, to which \nthe latter replied in the affirmative. The elder son had left home at daylight \nto gather fish. On Sunday he came to his father's house and delivered over to \nhim the tax money, stating that he had not gone to the treasurer's office on \nFriday at all. The defendant paid the tax on the next day, Monday.<\/p>\n<p>These are the facts of the case as made by the united testimony of the \ndefendant and his two sons. There are no inconsistencies in their testimony, \ntheir story is reasonable, and the sole ground given by the trial court for \nrefusing to credit their declarations is that they are all related, and \nconsequently interested in the acquittal of the defendant. But it is error to \ndiscredit the testimony of witnesses on the ground of interest alone. If the \ntestimony of an interested witness is reasonable and consistent and is not \ncontradicted by evidence from any reliable source, we see no reason, as a \ngeneral rule, for not accepting it. The frank confession of the defendant of his \nknowledge of the law making it a criminal offense for a delinquent taxpayer to \nqualify for an elective office, and his promptness in paying the tax on Monday, \nwhich was the first available opportunity for doing so after his eldest son \ninformed him that it had not been paid, indicate to us that he did not take the \noath of office knowing that his taxes were delinquent.<\/p>\n<p>Upon a careful consideration of the testimony of record we conclude that the \ntrial court did not give due weight to the testimony for the defendant, and that \nsuch testimony rebuts the inference that he took the oath of office knowing that \nhis taxes were delinquent. A precedent both in the facts and law governing our \ndecision is United States <em>vs.<\/em> Lopez (16 Phil. Rep., 416).<\/p>\n<p>The defendant is therefore acquitted, with costs <em>de officio<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

JOSE PATOTO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">Jose Patoto, the appellant in this case, was convicted in the court below of \nthe crime of homicidio (felonious homicide), and sentenced to twelve years and \none day of reclusion temporal, together with the accessory penalties prescribed \nby law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1l,000, and to pay \nthe costs of the trial. The prescribed penalty was imposed in its minimum degree \nbecause the trial judge was of opinion that the crime was committed in \nvindication of a grave offense against the daughter of the accused.\n<p>Giving the accused the benefit of any reasonable doubts raised by the \nconflicting testimony of record, it appears that the deceased, Catibog, struck \nand reprimanded the daughter of the accused for trespassing on his land; that \nnot long afterwards the accused approached Catibog and asked him what he meant \nby maltreating his daughter; that a quarrel ensued in the course of which \nCatibog struck the accused several times with a club; that after receiving one \nor two blows on the head the accused took out his pocketknife and slashed \nCatibog across the abdomen; that soon after being stabbed Catibog fell \nhelplessly to the ground and died four or five hours later; that immediately \nafter the quarrel the accused gave himself up to the municipal authorities; that \nCatibog was a decidedly larger and stronger man than the accused, and had a \nreputation as a dangerous man in the community in which he lived.<\/p>\n<p>The most serious conflict in the testimony arose in relation to the question \nas to which of the two struck the first blow. We are of opinion, however, that \nthe disinterested testimony of the medical officer is conclusive on this point. \nHe testified that it would have been a physical impossibility for Catibog to \nhave struck the accused with the club after receiving the knife thrust in the \nabdomen, which disemboweled him. This evidence raises a reasonable doubt as to \nthe exact truth of the story told by a niece of the deceased who was the only \neyewitness of the fight\u2014a doubt which is not dispelled by the vague, uncertain, \nand indefinite ante mortem statement of the deceased.<\/p>\n<p>On the whole record, and giving the accused the benefit of the doubt, we \nincline to the belief that before the accused took out his knife Catibog had \nstruck him at least twice with his club, and that the accused made use of his \nknife in repelling the attack upon him by the deceased.<\/p>\n<p>Upon these findings of fact we are of opinion that the accused is exempt from \ncriminal responsibility for the striking of the fatal blow. The victim of an \nunlawful and unprovoked assault with a heavy club in the hands of a strong and \npowerful man, whose reputation as a dangerous man was well-known in the \ncommunity in which he lived, the accused had a perfect right to defend himself, \nprovided the means adopted to repel the attack were reasonably necessary to \nrelieve him from the danger to which he was exposed. Unarmed, as he was, ;we are \nnot prepared to say that in taking a knife from his pocket and stabbing his \npowerful assailant, who had already struck him twice on the head, he did any \nmore than was reasonably necessary to protect himself from an assault which \nmight well have resulted in the loss of his life, and could hardly fail to \nresult in the infliction of grave personal injuries. When the fatal blow was \nstruck he ad already received two severe blows on the head. There was no one \npresent upon whom he could call for help. His assailant was a larger and more \npowerful man than himself, armed with a club and still pressing the unlawful and \nunprovoked assault. Under such circumstances, and there not appearing to have \nbeen any other means by which the accused could reasonably hope to avoid the \nthreatened danger, we believe that he was entirely justified in the use of his \nknife, the only available weapon of self-defense.<\/p>\n<p>We conclude, therefore, that the judgment entered in the court below \nconvicting the accused of the crime of homicidio (felonious.homicide) and \nimposing the penalty prescribed by law for that offense should be reversed; that \nhe should be acquitted of the drime with which he is charged in the information; \nthat if in detention, he should be set at liberty forthwith, and if at liberty \nunder bail that his bondsmen should be exonerated; and that the costs in both \ninstances should be noted de offlcio.

From that sentence each of<br\/>the defendants appealed to \nthis court.<\/p>\n<p>In this court the appellants present a very interesting brief, in which they \nattempt to show that under the facts proven during the trial of the cause, and \nthe law applicable thereto, they are not guilty of the crime charged.<\/p>\n<p>From an examination of the record, we find that on the 19th day of September, \n1913, the Judge of the Municipal Court of the City of Manila, upon an affidavit \npresented, issued a search warrant, ordering Jose Gervasio to make a search on \nthe person of one, John Doe, in the house situated at No. 907 Calle Clavel, \nDistrict of Binondo, City of Manila, for the purpose of ascertaining whether or \nnot any utensils could be found in connection with the game commonly known as \n\"monte\"; that on the afternoon of the 21st day of September, 1913, the said \nGervasio, in company with two other policemen, Worthington and Gonzalez, went to \nthe house above mentioned, for the purpose of carrying out the order contained \nin the said search warrant; that upon arriving at said house, the said Jose \nGervasio went around to the rear, while Worthington and Gonzalez went to the \nfront door; that when Gervasio arrived at the rear of the house he saw a number \nof people (the number not known) escaping from the house; that Worthington and \nGonzalez being unable to enter the front door, went to a window and found the \ndefendant, Epifania Lanuza, inside, that they made known to Epifania Lanuza \ntheir desire to enter the house, showing to her at the same time their search \nwarrant; that Epifania Lanuza requested them to wait a minute; that while they \nwere waiting Jose Gervasio entered the house from the rear and opened the front \ndoor and directed Worthington and Gonzalez to enter; that immediately upon \nentering the house, and without disclosing to any of the persons therein the \npurpose of their entering, they started up stairs; that about the middle of the \natairway Worthington met Escolastico Lanuza coming down; that Worthington, by \nforce and threats, compelled the said Escolastico Lanuza to return to the top of \nthe stairs; that upon arriving at the top of the stairs, a general melee ensued, \nduring which Worthington was struck several times with bottles, with an axe and \nperhaps other things, including slippers; that the said Escolastico Lanuza and \nEpifania Lanuza probably participated in the melee; that then and there all of \nthe above defendants were arrested and carried to the police station and later \nthe above complaint was presented against them; that the said Epifania Lanuza \nwas a young girl of seventeen years of age; that the said Escolastico Lanuza was \na young man of nineteen years of age and that they are both students in the \nschools of the city of Manila.<\/p>\n<p>Without attempting to discuss the legal questions discussed by the \nappellants, and after a full consideration of the facts, taking into \nconsideration the fact that perhaps Epifania Lanuza did not understand the \npurpose of Worthington and his companions in entering the house, as well as the \nfact that Escolastico Lanuza knew absolutely nothing concerning the purpose of \nWorthington and his companions in the house at that time, and the fact that \nWorthington himself provoked said melee, and considering the ages of the \ndefendants, we are of the opinion that there is no sound reason why they should \nbe punished for the acts which they committed. In this conclusion, however, we \ndo not desire to be understood to have decided that the acts of the defendants, \nunder other conditions, might not have constituted the crime charged in the \ncomplaint.<\/p>\n<p>It is our judgment, therefore, that a sentence be entered revoking the \nsentence of the lower court, with costs de oficio.<\/p>\n<p>It is so ordered.<\/p>\n<p>After the expiration of 10 days from the date hereof, let judgment be entered \nin accordance herewith, and 10 days thereafter let the record be returned to the \ncourt from whence it came, for execution.<\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" no=\"\" shade=\"\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em>CONCURRING<\/em><\/p>\n<p><br\/><strong>MORELAND, J.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I agree to the result in this case.<\/p>\n<p>I base my decision on the fact that the appellants were not informed of the \npurpose for which the officials were visiting the place; that the young lady was \nnot fully dressed and resented the entrance of the complaining witnesses for \nthat reason in particular; that the two appellants were not alleged to have been \nengaged in the gambling which was alleged to have taken place in the building; \nand were not shown to have had any motive whatever leading them to frustrate the \nefforts of the police to raid a gambling game; that the controversy arose from \nmisunderstanding, fear and apprehension on the part of the appellants provoked \nby the action of the authorities.<\/p><\/div>",

Rules \n19 and 20 read as follows:\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"19. Prefixed to the brief of the appellant, but stated separately, shall be \nan assignment of errors intended to be urged. Each specification of error shall \nbe separately, distinctly, and concisely stated without repetition, and they \nshall be numbered consecutively. All briefs shall be printed and shall exhibit \nan extract of the argument on the points of law or fact to be discussed, with \nreference to the pages of the record and the authorities relied upon in support \nof each point. The brief of the appellant shall also contain a concise statement \nof the facts in the case.<\/p>\n<p>\"20. No error not affecting the jurisdiction over the subject matter will be \nconsidered unless stated in the assignment of errors and relied upon in the \nbrief.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The appeal is from a judgment dismissing the complaint with costs after \nsustaining a demurrer to the complaint on the ground that it does not state a \ncause of action. Under the usual heading, the brief starts off with the \nfollowing paragraphs:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This is an appeal in the above-entitled cause against an order handed down \non January 24, 1914, dismissing the complaint, and excepted to by the \nappellant.<\/p>\n<p>\"In the opinion of the appellant, the complaint sets forth facts of \nsufficient weight to constitute a cause of action, and the demurrer interposed \nagainst the same ought to be overruled, notwithstanding the opinion of the \nHonorable (judge) Crossfield, who holding the personal action of the appellant \nto be a real action, arrived at the conclusion that article 335 of the Code of \nCivil Procedure must be applied in this case. This, in our opinion, is an error \nwhich greatly prejudices the interest of the plaintiff, * * *.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The brief then continues to discuss the facts alleged in the complaint and \ntheir sufficiency in law to constitute a right of action. It is urged that this \nis not a compliance with the above-quoted rules nor with our decision in Paterno \n<em>vs.<\/em> City of Manila (17 Phil. Rep., 26), to which we also add Santiago \n<em>vs.<\/em> Felix (24 Phil. Rep., 378).<\/p>\n<p>In the first case, \"counsel for appellant in his printed brief makes no \nspecific assignment of errors, but argues in a general way two questions.\" In \nthe second case, the single error assigned was, \"The Court of First Instance of \nthis city incurred error in rendering the judgment appealed from, for it is \ncontrary to law and the weight of the evidence.\" <\/p>\n<p>It is apparent that the case at bar is to be distinguished from the first \ncase, because there is in the opening statement of the appellant a reasonable \nspecific assignment of error, to wit, that the court erred in holding that the \ncomplaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. While \nnot being set off by itself and labeled as an assignment of error, this \nstatement makes the point as effectually if not as artistically. Such a \nstatement requires an inspection of the complaint and of the complaint alone for \nits determination. To set off the error assigned with an appropriate title would \ntend to clearness of style and hence be more acceptable to the court, but it \nwould not avoid the necessity of examining the contents of the complaint.<\/p>\n<p>The present case may also be readily distinguished from the second case \ncited. There are so many ways in which a judgment may be contrary to law and the \nweight of the evidence that such a general statement leaves the court absolutely \nin the dark as to what to look for. An alleged error should have definite bounds \nand be limited as far as possible to a single point. Nothing could be more \nirreducible than the statement that the complaint does not state facts \nsufficient to constitute a cause of action, without limiting the extent of the \ninquiry. For such a statement requires an inspection of the complaint as a \nwhole, and nothing less will suffice to dispose of it. It requires an \nexamination of only one particular portion of the record, to wit, the initial \npleading\u2014the complaint.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, in the two cases cited, the cases had gone to judgment on \nthe merits and a mere general discussion of what had transpired or the statement \nthat the judgment was contrary to law left the court to struggle through the \nbriefs and records in an effort to pick out something wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Although the brief of the appellant is not a literal compliance with the \nrules of the court, nor is it a work of art from a professional point of view, \nstill, we do not believe the departure from the prescribed practice has been so \nradical as to call for a dismissal of the case. We do not desire, however, to be \nunderstood as holding that it is not absolutely necessary to comply \nsubstantially with the above-quoted rules.<\/p>\n<p>The motion is therefore denied.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

There are some expressions used therein, however, \nwhich may be misleading in view of other decisions of this court, and it is to \nthat situation that I desire to call attention.<\/p>\n<p>The court, in comparing an assignment of error providing that \"the Court of \nFirst Instance of this city erred in rendering the judgment appealed from, for \nit is contrary to law and the weight of the evidence\" with a demurrer to a \ncomplaint upon the ground \"that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to \nconstitute a cause of action,\" makes the observation that \"nothing could be more \nirreducible than a statement that the complaint does not state facts sufficient \nto constitute a cause of action, without limiting the extent of, the inquiry.\" \nThe purpose of the court in making this comparison is to demonstrate that the \nallegation that a judgment is contrary to law and the weight of the evidence is \na reducible statement, that is, a statement so general that it means nothing and \npoints put no error of which the appellate court can take notice; whereas the \nstatement that a complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause \nof action is a statement so specific and direct and points out so clearly the \nerror in the complaint as to be entirely irreducible; that is, by no language \ncould, the error in the complaint be more specifically pointed out or attention \nmore directly and definitely called thereto.<\/p>\n<p>I take exception to the statement with. regard to the irreducibility of the \nallegation that a complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a \ncause of action and support my contention in the decision of this court in the \ncase of Lizarraga Hermanos <em>vs.<\/em> Yap Tico (24 Phil. Rep., 504).<\/p>\n<p>In that case one of the questions presented to and resolved by the court \narose upon the sufficiency of a demurrer which simply alleged that the complaint \ndid not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; and, far from \nholding that said statement was an irreducible statement and was so definite and \ncertain, and so direct in calling the attention of the court to the error \ncharged, that it could not be improved on in that regard, this court held \nprecisely the contrary, namely, that a demurrer containing such a statement was \nso general and indefinite and failed so completely to comply with the express \nprovisions of section 91 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that it was a defective \ndemurrer <em>for that reason<\/em> and, if objected to upon that ground, could \nnot be held to have raised any question as to the sufficiency of the complaint. \nThe court laid down the doctrine in that case that, when a defendant demurred to \na complaint upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute \na cause of action, he must point out the precise objection to which he alluded \nand state specifically wherein the complaint failed to state a cause of \naction.<\/p>\n<p>In discussing that question we said: \"A demurrer * * * should not leave the \ncourt and the party against whose pleading it is aimed as ignorant of the defect \nin the offending pleading as before the demurrer is filed. Many times the \nobjection that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a \ncause of action means very little. There are occasions, of course, when it is \nsufficient. But it is certain that no injury can ever result from naming the \n<em>precise reason<\/em> why the complaint does not state facts sufficient to \nconstitute a cause of action; and, in the great majority of cases, great good \nwill come of it.\"<\/p>\n<p>And further on in the decision the court also said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When a demurrer is made to a complaint, whether upon one ground or another, \nit should set out distinctly the grounds upon which the objection is based. It \ncannot be couched simply in the language of the code. It must set-forth \ndistinctly the grounds upon which that language is founded. The reason for. this \nis plain. It is not fair to the plaintiff to interpose to a complaint the simple \nobjection that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of \naction. Neither is it fair to the court. Neither the plaintiff nor the court \nshould be left to make, possibly, a long and tiresome examination and \ninvestigation and then, perhaps, finally be compelled to guess. The grounds of \nthe objection should be pointed out so that all may see. A demurrer was not \ninvented to make useless work for a court, or to deceive or delude a plaintiff. \nIts purpose was to clarify all ambiguities; to make certain all indefinite \nassertions ; to bring the plaintiff to a clear and clean expression of the \nprecise grievance which he has against the defendant; to aid in arriving at a \nreal issue between the parties; to promote understanding and prevent surprise. \nTo that end, a demurrer should specify, for the benefit of the plaintiff and the \ncourt as well, the very weakness which the demurrant believes he sees in the \ncomplaint. It should be so presented and handled as to bring to a quick \ndetermination the question whether the plaintiff has, at bottom, a legal claim \nagainst the defendant. To attain this object, the demurrer should be clear, \nspecific, definite, and certain as to the precise weakness of the complaint. \nBeing an instrument to cure imperfections, it should not itself be \nimperfect.<\/p>\n<p>\"To the complaint before us a demurrer was interposed, stating merely that \nthe complaint did not allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. \nNo particular ground was specified. No specific failure was asserted or named. \nNo precise weakness was pointed out. The order overruling the demurrer does not \nindicate that the court was informed as to the specific grounds upon which it \nwas based. Certainly, so far as the record goes, the plaintiffs never knew until \nafter the demurrer was decided precisely what the defendant was driving at when \nhe presented it.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The court says that the statement that a complaint does not state facts \nsufficient to constitute a cause of action is so definite, direct and clear that \nit cannot be made more so \"without limiting the extent of 'the inquiry.\" The \n\"extent of the inquiry\" in such a case is to determine whether the complaint \nstates a cause of action or not; and it in no wise limits the extent of the \ninquiry for the demurrant to point out where and in what particular the \ncomplaint fails to state a cause of action. Precisely the same inquiry exists in \none case as in the other. The inquiry always is: Does the complaint state facts \nsufficient to constitute a cause of action ? And that inquiry is not limited by \nrequiring the demurrant to point out the particular ground upon which he makes \nthe allegation.<\/p>\n<p>The statement quoted is not necessary to a decision of the case at bar, and I \nwould not refer to it except that it might cause confusion in the mind of the \nbench or the bar in such a way as to weaken the doctrine laid down in the case \nabove cited. With modification in this respect, I would not hesitate to concur \nfully in the decision as written.<\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" no=\"\" shade=\"\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<p><\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>DISSENTING<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>JOHNSON, J.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>From an examination of the record, I fail to find any sound reason for not \nrequiring the appellant to comply, with Rules 19 and 20 of this court, as we \nhave done in other cases. (Paterno<em> vs. <\/em>City of Manila, 17 Phil. Rep., \n26; Santiago <em>vs.<\/em> Felix, 24 Phil. Rep., 378.) <\/p>\n<p>In the case of Paterno<em> vs.<\/em> City of Manila (<em>supra<\/em>), this \ncourt said: \"The rules of this court are few and simple. They have been \npromulgated for several years, and every practicing attorney should be familiar \nwith them. They are the laws of the court and <em>must<\/em> be obeyed until \nrepealed, unless it can be shown that they are in conflict with the laws of the \nUnited States or the Philippine Islands.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Santiago <em>vs.<\/em> Felix (<em>supra<\/em>), this court said: \n<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is an established rule of this court, <em>uniformly applied in many \ncases,<\/em> that if the appellant fails to make an assignment of errors and \nmerely confines himself to a discussion of facts in general, this court can not \ndisturb the adverse finding of the trial court alleged to be contrary to law and \nthe weight of the evidence; it is necessary that the appellant point out \nspecifically the alleged error or errors in the judgment appealed \nfrom.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As was said in the case of Paterno<em> vs.<\/em> City of Manila:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The rules of this court are few and simple. They have been promulgated for \nseveral years and every practicing attorney should be familiar with them.\" Said \nRule 19 requires an assignment of errors by the appellant; it requires that \nthere shall be prefixed to the brief of the appellant an assignment of errors \nintended to be urged; that each assignment of error shall be separately, \ndistinctly and concisely stated, without repetition. Said rule or requirement \nfollows practically the rule of the Supreme Court of the United States. The \npurpose of the rule, as has been repeatedly stated by the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, is to enable a busy court and the opposing counsel to see on what \npoints opposing counsel intend to ask a reversal of the judgment, and for the \nfurther, and perhaps just as important a reason, to limit the discussion of the \nparties on the appeal to particular points, either of fact or of law. (Philipps \n<em>vs.<\/em> Seymour, 91 U. S., 646.) See also the following cases in which the \nSupreme Court of the United States dismissed the appeals for the reason that the \nappellants failed to make an assignment of error, in accordance with the rules; \nTreat <em>vs.<\/em> Jemison (20 Wall., 652); Maxwell <em>vs.<\/em> Stewart (21 \nWall., 71); Gumbel <em>vs. <\/em>Pitkin (113 U. S., 545); Dugger <em>vs.<\/em> \nTayloe (121 U. S., 286); Benites <em>vs.<\/em> Hampton (123 IL S., 519); Rowe \n<em>vs<\/em>. Phelps (152 U. S., 87).<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I suppose that in each argument by each appellant there might be found, upon \nreading it, the particular error of which he complains. Courts, however, should \nnot be required to read the arguments of appellants for the purpose of sifting \nout the particular error upon which they rely, especially when there have been \nestablished a \"few and simple\" rules for the purpose of facilitating the work of \nthe courts, as well as of counsel.<\/p>\n<p>I see no reason why the motion of the appellee in the present case should not \nhave been granted, at least to the extent of requiring the appellant to make a \nspecial assignment or assignments of error upon which he expected to ask the \ncourt to reverse the judgment appealed from.<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/div>",

This action was brought to recover the value of the \n<em>Euclid.<\/em>\n<p>The court below held from the evidence submitted that the <em>Euclid<\/em> was \nworth at a fair valuation P10,000; that both vessels were responsible for the \ncollision; and that the loss should be divided equally between the respective \nowners, P5,000 to be paid to the plaintiff by the defendant, and P5,000 to be \nborne by the plaintiff himself. From this judgment both defendant and plaintiff \nappealed.<\/p>\n<p>After a careful review of all the evidence of record we are all agreed with \nthe trial judge in his holding that the responsible officers on both vessels \nwere negligent in the performance of their duties at the time when the accident \noccurred, and that both vessels were to blame for the collision. We do not deem \nit necessary to review the conflicting testimony of the witnesses called by both \nparties, the trial judge having inserted in his opinion a careful and critical \nsummary and analysis of the testimony submitted to him, which, to our minds, \nfully and satisfactorily disposes of the facts in the case. His conclusions of \nfact based upon all the evidence are set forth in the following language \n(translated):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In view of the negligence of which the patron Millonario (of defendant's \nvessel) has been guilty as well as that imputable to the patron of the launch \nEuclid, both contributed in a decided manner and beyond all doubt to the \noccurrence of the accident and the consequent damage resulting there from in the \nloss of the launch <em>Euclid.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\"With a little diligence which either of the two patrons might have practiced \nunder the circumstances existing at the time of the collision, if both had not \nbeen so distracted and so negligent in the fulfillment of their respective \nduties, the disaster could have been easily avoided, since the sea was free of \nobstacles and the night one which permitted the patron Millonario to distinguish \nthe hull of the launch twenty minutes before the latter entered upon his path * \n* * <\/p>\n<p>\"There is proven, therefore, the negligence of which the patron of the \n<em>Euclid<\/em> has been guilty.<\/p>\n<p>\"If the negligence by which the patron of the launch <em>Euclid<\/em> has \ncontributed to the cause of the accident and to the resulting damages is patent, \nnone the less so is the negligence of the patron of the steamer <em>Subic,<\/em> \nHilarion Millonario by name, as may be seen from his own testimony which is here \ncopied for the better appreciation thereof.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It will be seen that the trial judge was of opinion that the vessels were \njointly responsible for the collision and should be held jointly liable for the \nloss resulting from the sinking of the launch. But actions for damages resulting \nfrom maritime collisions are governed in this jurisdiction by the provisions of \nsection 3, title 4, Book III of the Code of Commerce, and among these provisions \nwe find the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Art. 827. If both vessels may be blamed for the collision, each one shall be \nliable for its own damages, and both shall be jointly responsible for the loss \nand damage suffered by their cargoes,\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In disposing of this case the trial judge apparently had in mind that portion \nof the section which treats of the joint liability of both vessels for loss or \ndamage suffered by their cargoes. In the case at bar, however, the only loss \nincurred was that of the launch <em>Euclid<\/em> itself, which went to the bottom \nsoon after the collision. Manifestly, under the plain terms of the statute, \nsince the evidence of record clearly discloses, as found by the trial judge, \nthat \"both vessels may be blamed for the collision,\" each one must be held \nliable for its own damages, and the owner1 of neither one can recover from the \nother in an action for damages to his vessel.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the plaintiff, basing his contentions upon the theory of the \nfacts as contended for by him, insists that under the doctrine of \"the last \nclear chance,\" the defendant should be held liable because, as he insists, even \nif the officers on board the plaintiff's launch were negligent in failing to \nexhibit proper lights and in failing to take the proper steps to keep out of the \npath of the defendant's vessel, nevertheless the officers on defendant's vessel, \nby the exercise of due precautions might have avoided the collision by a very \nsimple maneuver. But it is sufficient answer to this contention to point out \nthat the rule of liability in this jurisdiction for maritime accidents such as \nthat now under consideration is clearly, definitely, and unequivocally laid down \nin the above-cited article 827 of the Code of Commerce; and under that rule, the \nevidence disclosing that both vessels were blameworthy, the owners of neither \ncan successfully maintain an action against the other for the loss or injury of \nhis vessel.<\/p>\n<p>In cases of a disaster arising from mutual negligence of two parties, the \nparty who has a last clear opportunity of avoiding the accident, notwithstanding \nthe negligence of his opponent, is considered wholly responsible for it under \nthe common-law rule of liability as applied in the courts of common law in the \nUnited States. But this rule (which is not recognized in the courts of admiralty \nin the United States, wherein the loss is divided in cases of mutual and \nconcurring negligence, as also where the error of one vessel has exposed her to \ndanger of collision which was consummated by the negligence of the other), is \nlimited in its application by the further rule, that where the previous act of \nnegligence of one vessel has created a position of danger, the other vessel is \nnot necessarily liable for the mere failure to recognize the perilous situation; \nand it is only when in fact it does discover it in time to avoid the casualty by \nthe use of ordinary care, that it becomes liable for the failure to make use of \nthis last clear opportunity to avoid the accident. (See cases cited in Notes, 7 \nCyc., pp. 311, 312, 313.) So, under the English rule which conforms very nearly \nto the common-law 'rule as applied in the American courts, it has been held that \nthe fault of the first vessel in failing to exhibit proper lights or to take the \nproper side of the channel will relieve from liability one who negligently runs \ninto such vessel before he sees it; although it will not be a defense to one \nwho, having timely warning of the danger of collision, fails to use proper care \nto avoid it. (Pollock on Torts, 374.) In the case at bar, the most that can be \nsaid in support of plaintiff's contention is that there was negligence on the \npart of the officers on defendant's vessel in failing to recognize the perilous \nsituation created by the negligence of those in charge of plaintiff's launch, \nand that had they recognized it in time, they might have avoided the accident. \nBut since it does not appear from the evidence that they did, in fact, discover \nthe perilous situation of the launch in time to avoid the accident by the \nexercise of ordinary care, it is very clear that under the above set out \nlimitation to the rule, the plaintiff cannot escape the legal consequences of \nthe contributory negligence of his launch, even were we to hold that the \ndoctrine is applicable in this jurisdiction, upon which point we expressly \nreserve our decision at this time.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the court below in favor of the plaintiff and against the \ndefendant should be reversed, and the plaintiff's complaint should be dismissed \nwithout day, without costs to either party in this instance.

CLAYTON AND E. 0. CLAYTON, HER HUSBAND, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This action was brought by the plaintiff to recover the sum of P1,797.80, a \nbalance alleged to be due on account of merchandise sold and delivered to the \ndefendant. Plaintiff is a wholesale merchant of San Francisco, California, \ndealing in ladies' wearing apparel, and the principal defendant, Mrs. E. 0. \nClayton, was at the time of the purchase of the goods in question engaged in the \nbusiness of retailing ladies' wearing apparel in the city of Manila.\n<p>From an examination of the account rendered by the plaintiff it is evident \nthat the alleged balance claimed to be due from the defendant is substantially \nthe amount charged for certain goods which it is admitted were shipped by the \nplaintiff to the defendant in Manila, and by her returned as unsatisfactory and \nunsalable.<\/p>\n<p>Defendant insists that she is entitled to have the value of the goods \nreturned credited on her account, while plaintiff denies that she had any right \nto make such a return, or to have credit therefor. If defendant is entitled to a \ncredit on her account for the value of the goods returned by her, the judgment \nof the trial court dismissing the complaint must be sustained, it appearing that \nthe amount of the credit to which she would thus be entitled is slightly in \nexcess of the amount of the balance claimed under the account.<\/p>\n<p>The principal and, indeed, the only real question for determination is, \ntherefore, whether under all the circumstances as they appear from the record, \ndefendant had the right to return goods shipped to her on her order by the \nplaintiff but which did not meet with her approval, and to receive credit \ntherefor on her account.<\/p>\n<p>There does not appear to have been any express understanding in this regard \nat the time when the account was opened in December, 1910. The record, however, \nclearly discloses that on more than one occasion defendant did in fact return \ncertain goods shipped her by the plaintiff which did not meet with her approval \nand which she considered unsuited to her retail trade. And it further appears, \nthat up to the time of the return of the particular shipment of goods in \nquestion in this action, plaintiff received and accepted goods returned by the \ndefendant and credited her account with the amount originally charged thereon \nfor the goods thus returned.<\/p>\n<p>On Augusts, 1911 the defendant wrote to the plaintiff as follows (Exhibit B): \n\"I was greatly disappointed in the special lot of thirty dresses which you \nforwarded by mail in response to my cable. I am returning by this same mail \ntwenty-one gowns. I looked these over carefully half a dozen times, and \nconscientiously tried to make myself believe I could sell one or two out of this \nlot, and I am certain that it is absolutely impossible to do so.\"<\/p>\n<p>The letter then continues to explain in considerable detail the demands of \nher retail trade in Manila, and after giving some suggestion as to the character \nof goods wanted, continues: \"I trust, Mr. Juda, that you now thoroughly \nunderstand my position, and in future shipments anything the least bit tawdry or \ncheap appearing will be cut out.\"<\/p>\n<p>Plaintiff answered this letter under date of September 16, 1911, as follows \n(Exhibit 2): \"The goods returned checked up correctly, and we have placed the \namount to your credit. At the time we made you this mail shipment we wrote you \nthat under these conditions we did the very best we could, and have hoped that \nthe line's {sic, lion's) share of this particular shipment will meet your \napproval.* * * * Again we say to you if from time to time you will write us a \nfew lines stating your wants, it will materially assist us in getting out for \nyou merchandise which will be profitable for you and save us other returns.\"<\/p>\n<p>In another letter dated August 21, 1911, plaintiff said: \"For such of our \nmerchandise as you are returning to us, we will mail you credit memorandum on \nthe next steamer, and will deduct the amount of this credit from your, next \npurchase.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the month of September, 1911, defendant left Manila for San Francisco and \narrived there early in the month of October, bringing with her some of the \narticles received from the plaintiff in shipments made in the months of June and \nJuly, which she herself returned personally to the plaintiff while in San \nFrancisco, receiving due credit therefor on her account. At that time there was \nsome conversation between the parties in regard to the practice of defendant in \nmaking returns of shipments which were not satisfactory to her, and she having \nmade a personal selection of a new shipment made at that time, it was then \nagreed that she was not to have the right to make any returns upon that \nshipment.<\/p>\n<p>We think that the correspondence between the parties, taken together with \ntheir conduct in connection with the returns made on several occasions by the \ndefendant, clearly discloses that up to the time when they met in San Francisco \nlate in the year 1911, defendant believed that she had a right to return goods \nshipped to her by the plaintiff which she did not regard as satisfactory or \nappropriate for her trade. We think, too, that plaintiff, by acquiescing in the \naction of the defendant in making these returns and by allowing her a credit on \nher account for the value of the goods thus returned, confirmed her in her \nbelief as to her right in this respect. In some of the letters written by \nplaintiff to the defendant we find regrets that goods were returned to him, but \nin none of them does he seem to question the right of the defendant to pursue \nthe course adopted by her.<\/p>\n<p>Thus in the letter above quoted of September 16, 1911, he says: \"We did the \nvery best we could, and have hoped that the line's (lion's) share of this \nparticular shipment will meet your approval.\"<\/p>\n<p>And then again he seems to have anticipated the possibility of other \n\"returns,\" or why should he have written to the defendant to this effect: \"Again \nwe say to you that if from time to time, you will write us a few lines stating \nyour wants, it will materially assist us in getting out for you merchandise \nwhich will be profitable for you and save us other returns,\"<\/p>\n<p>Before leaving for the United States in the month of September, 1911, the \ndefendant directed the manager of her retail establishment in Manila to select \nfrom the June, July, and August shipments from the plaintiff any articles which \nappeared to be unsatisfactory or unsalable, and return them to the shipper. In \naccordance with her instructions her manager selected for return goods to the \nvalue of $933.75 (P1,867.50) and forwarded them to the plaintiff in San \nFrancisco. The question before us is as to defendant's right to reject and \nreturn these goods and to receive credit therefor. Most of these rejected goods \nwere included in the August, 1911, shipment, which does not appear to have \narrived in Manila at the time when the defendant set sail for the United States. \nA few of the articles, however, seem to have been selected from the June and \nJuly shipments which were in stock at that time.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant testified that on her arrival in San Francisco she advised the \nplaintiff that in addition to the goods she had brought with her there would be \nanother shipment of returns later on for which she desired credit, and that \nplaintiff at that time made no objections on that account. Plaintiff denies \npositively that he received any such information, and testified that the first \nintimation he received in regard to the return of these goods was on January 24, \n1912, the day following the departure of the defendant on her return to \nManila.<\/p>\n<p>Of course if defendant's claim that she had advised the plaintiff when in San \nFrancisco as to the fact that she had directed the return of these goods, and \nthat plaintiff at that time made no objection to her action in this regard, were \nsatisfactorily established, there would be nothing left of the case, and there \ncould be no question of her right to be credited with the amount of the goods \nthus returned. We are strongly inclined, however, to doubt the claim of the \ndefendant that she informed the plaintiff that she had arranged for the return \nof these goods. It appears that they were shipped to her agent in San Francisco \nfor delivery to the plaintiff, and that they arrived some little time before her \ndeparture on her return trip to Manila. She admits that although she knew that \nthey had arrived she said nothing to the plaintiff in regard to their arrival in \nthe interviews she had with him not long before she left San Francisco ; and \nfrom all the evidence it is clear that when the goods were delivered to the \nplaintiff a few days after her departure, he was taken by surprise and had no \nidea that the defendant had in fact directed the return of so large and \nsubstantial a part of the August shipment. It may be true that the defendant \ntold the plaintiff in San Francisco that she had directed her agent in Manila to \nreturn some of the articles received after her departure, but it is very clear \nthat she did not intimate to the plaintiff that she expected, to return a \nsubstantial part of the August shipment, or that the value of the goods thus \nreturned would be much greater in proportion to the shipment made than the value \nof the goods which she had brought to be returned in person. From her conduct \nwhile in San Francisco, and having in mind the unexplained delay in the delivery \nof the goods thus returned to the plaintiff after their arrival in the hands of \nher agent in San Francisco, we are strongly inclined to believe that she was not \nwholly frank with the plaintiff in any references she may have made to these \ngoods, and that she Was anxious to close up her business with the plaintiff and \nto get out of San Francisco on her way back to Manila before he learned the full \nextent and nature of this return shipment. Under all the circumstances as \ndeveloped by the record we accept as true the plaintiff's denial of all \nknowledge that such a shipment had been made by the defendant until the goods \nwere actually delivered after her departure for Manila, and we are satisfied \nthat he did not expressly agree to receive them and to credit them on account at \nthe time when defendant claims that she advised him of the fact that they were \nen route, during her interview with him in San Francisco.<\/p>\n<p>These goods, however, had actually been shipped from Manila prior to the date \nof the interview between plaintiff and defendant in San Francisco. In \ndetermining the right of defendant to make the returns and to have them credited \non her account we must look, in the absence of an express agreement, to the \nconduct of the parties and the nature of their business relations prior to and \nat the date of their return. From what has been said we think that there can be \nno doubt that defendant had a right, acquiesced in and assented to by the \nplaintiff, to make returns of merchandise shipped her by the plaintiff which she \nbelieved to be unsuited for the business which she conducted in Manila. \nDoubtless this right to make returns was not an absolute unqualified right to \nreturn any or all goods received, and there being no express agreement in regard \nthereto, defendant could only exercise the right in a reasonable manner; but \nthere is nothing in the record which would justify us in holding that in making \nthe particular return in question she or her agents acted arbitrarily or \nunreasonably. It is true that prior to that date the returns made by her had \nnever amounted to anything like as much in value as did the return in question, \nbut it does definitely appear that on one occasion she returned twenty-one out \nof a lot of thirty dresses shipped her. The question as to whether a return of \ngoods included in any particular shipment from the plaintiff was reasonable and \nin accordance with the implied agreement arising out of the mercantile relations \nof the parties, necessarily depends upon the amount of the particular shipment \nwhich was suited to defendant's retail trade in Manila. In regard to the \nshipment in question we have no evidence of record, other than the fact that \ndefendant's manager in her absence rejected these goods, upon which to base a \nconclusion as to the reasonableness of her conduct in this regard. It may be \nthat a part or all of these goods were improperly returned, and that under a \nfair construction of the implied agreement between the parties they should not \nhave been returned, but there is nothing in the record upon which to base a \nfinding to that effect. The lack of an express agreement as to the circumstances \nand conditions under which such returns were to be made, practically left the \nplaintiff in the hands of the defendant, and if he has any just cause for \ncomplaint, it would seem that his inability to establish the loss or damage \nsuffered by him must be attributed to the manifestly unbusinesslike arrangement \nunder which he entered into and carried on mercantile relations with the \ndefendant.<\/p>\n<p>Plaintiff undertook to rebut defendant's claim of a right to make returns of \nunsuitable goods by showing that defendant's mother, who resides in or near San \nFrancisco, acted as her agent in passing upon and approving all shipments made \nby him. We are of opinion that the evidence does not sustain a finding that \ndefendant's mother was her agent for that purpose, with authority to impose upon \ndefendant an obligation to accept all goods approved by her. We think that the \nevidence sufficiently establishes that while plaintiff consulted with \ndefendant's mother as to the goods forwarded in some shipments, he was not bound \nto do so. Indeed, it was only when it suited the convenience of the parties that \nshe conferred with the plaintiff, and there was no agreement between the parties \nbinding the plaintiff to ship only such goods as met with defendant's mother's \napproval. Moreover, we think the correspondence and the conduct of the parties \nsufficiently establishes the right of defendant to make returns of unsuitable \ngoods, whether her mother had or had not approved the selection made by \nplaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>It is contended that judgment should be rendered in favor of the plaintiff \nfor the amount claimed in the complaint as a balance due on an \"account stated.\" \nIt appears that an account on which no credit was made for the return of the \ngoods in question and which showed a balance due in the amount as claimed in the \ncomplaint, was mailed by plaintiff in San Francisco to defendant in Manila, and \nthat she did not forthwith reply thereto, returning and repudiating the account \nand denying her indebtedness. It is urged that her silence should be held to be \nan implied admission of the correctness of the account, and an acquiescence in \nthe statement of the balance due.<\/p>\n<p>We cannot agree with these contentions. An account stated is an agreement \nbetween persons who have had previous transactions, fixing the amount due in \nrespect of such transactions. The essential element of such an account is the \nacknowledgement by the parties of the balance shown to be due on the account, or \nof the truth and accuracy and completeness of the items therein set forth. \nBefore an account can be given the binding effect of an account stated it must \naffirmatively appear that the parties did in fact reach an agreement as to its \ncorrectness. Assent as to the correctness of an account rendered may fairly be \npresumed and is presumed, especially between merchants, from the conduct of the \nparty to whom the account is rendered. His silence after receipt of the account \nwithout raising any objections thereto within a reasonable time raises a fair \npresumption of his acquiescence, in the absence of proof of circumstances from \nwhich counter-inferences may be drawn. But there is no arbitrary rule of law \nwhich renders an omission to object in a given time equivalent to an actual \nagreement or consent to the correctness of the account, and the presumption of \nacquiescence may always be rebutted by evidence of facts and circumstances in a \nparticular case from which a counter-inference must be drawn.<\/p>\n<p>In the case at bar defendant had returned to plaintiff goods to the value of \nP1,865.50, for which she claimed the right to a credit on her account. \nPlaintiff, although he acknowledged the return of these goods, positively denied \nthe right of defendant to have them credited on her account. The matter was in \ndispute between them. Plaintiff well knew that defendant insisted on her right \nto have these goods credited on her account. Defendant had done nothing to lead \nhim to believe that she had waived her claim to a credit. On the contrary both \nparties were fully advised that defendant claimed and plaintiff denied the right \nto a credit of the value of the goods. No settlement of this difference had been \nreached by the parties when the account was rendered. The goods rejected and \nreturned by the defendant must be presumed to have had some value, and plaintiff \nwell knew that he could not retain them and at the same time decline to give \ncredit for at least their actual market value in the condition in which they \nwere received by him. No reference whatever was made to these goods in the \naccount actually rendered. It is clear therefore that the failure of defendant \nto make an express repudiation of the account rendered under these conditions \ncannot fairly be held to be an acquiescence in the account as a correct \nstatement of the status of the mercantile relations between herself and the \nplaintiff, nor an implied admission of its correctness and a waiver or \nabandonment of her claim on account of the goods to the value of P1,865.50 which \nshe had returned to the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment entered in the court below should be affirmed, with the costs of \nthis instance against the appellant.

MAXIMO MALLARI, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<\/title>This case has been brought up on appeal filed by the defendant from the \njudgment dated April 22, 1914, whereby the Honorable Julio Llorente, judge, \nsentenced him to the penalty of twelve years and one day of <em>reclusion \ntemporal<\/em>, accessories, the payment of an indemnity of P1,000 to the heirs \nof the deceased, and the costs.\n<p>On the morning of September 25, 1913, in the barrio of Batasan, municipality \nof Macabebe, Province of Pampanga, before going to his work, the defendant \nMaximo Mallari went to the house of the married couple, Vicente Sunga and Canuta \nFlores, and from the shed outside asked Vicente Sunga to cure his wife of a \nsickness from which she had been suffering for several days, and which he \nthought was due to enchantment on the part of the said Vicente. As the latter \nrefused, averring that he was not a wizard and that he had not caused the \nillness of defendant's wife, the former became enraged and insulted the said \nspouses. Threatening to kill them, he ascended the stairway carrying in his hand \na thin, sharp bolo. At his wife's suggestion Vicente Sunga tried to get out to \nreport the matter to the <em>teniente<\/em> of the barrio, who lived at some \npaces from their house, but as he met the defendant on the stairway, he \nimmediately went back inside and jumped out of a window. He was straightway \npursued by the defendant and on arriving almost in front of the house of the \n<em>teniente<\/em> saw that the defendant was following closely behind him. He \ntherefore turned to face his pursuer and defend himself as well as he could with \nhis hands. Thereupon the defendant with a single slash of the bolo wounded \nVicente Sunga in the abdomen, so that his intestines protruded therefrom. In \nthis condition the victim sat down, endeavoring with his hands to keep his \nintestines from falling out, while his assailant took to flight.<\/p>\n<p>The justice of the peace of Macabebe arrived on the scene a few moments later \nand in his presence the wounded man declared that his assailant was Mallari, who \nhad been in his house, and who had inflicted the serious wound he had in the \nabdomen. As a consequence of this wound he died three days later.<\/p>\n<p>An autopsy was held on the corpse by the physician who is president of the \nmunicipal board of health of Macabebe, and as a result of the examination made, \nit appeared that the deceased had received an incised wound in the epigastric \nregion, which penetrated the gastrocolic epiploon, the middle part of the \ntransverse colon and the rectoabdominal muscles and which had caused severe \nperitonitis, the.entire length of both intestines having become gangrened with \nsanious discharges. This wound was necessarily fatal, especially in view of the \nscarcity of antiseptics available in the towns of the provinces.<\/p>\n<p>The facts set forth appear to have been duly proven in the case and \nconstitute the crime of homicide, provided for and penalized in article 404 of \nthe Penal Code, for the reason that the defendant appeared at the house of \ndeceased with the demand that the latter treat his wife, whom he believed to be \nbewitched by the artifices of the deceased. As the latter refused to do so, \nsaying that he was not a wizard, the defendant Mallari insulted the Sunga \nspouses, threatened them with death and straightway went up into the house of \nthe deceased with a bolo in his hand. When the deceased saw this he immediately \nleaped out of the window in flight but the defendant pursued him and upon coming \nup with him in front of the house of the <em>teniente<\/em> of the barrio, to \nwhom he was going to complain, struck him a blow in the abdomen with the bolo, \ninflicting a serious and fatal wound that caused death on the third day \nthereafter.<\/p>\n<p>Defendant declared that on the morning of the occurrence his wife, who was \nill, told him before going to work to stop in at Isidro Sunga's house and ask \nthe latter's wife to treat her, for it was reported that she was a witch; that \nwhen he reached the yard of Isidro Sunga's house he asked the latter's son, \nSilvino Sunga, for his mother; that at Silvino's invitation he entered the yard \nand Isidro Sunga asked him from the window what he wanted and invited him to \ncome in; but that he refused to enter, saying that he could tell what he wanted \nfrom outside; that thereupon Isidro Sunga's wife appeared at the window and upon \nseeing him called to her children, saying that a bad man had come. Then they \nbegan to insult him, and when he tried to get away, Vicente Sunga, Silvino \nSunga, Isidro Sunga, and Florentino Sunga, armed with long bolos, pursued him. \nAt that instant Vicente Sunga, who was foremost among them, struck him a blow \nwith a pocket-knife on one of his rumps. Upon feeling the wound he turned and \nslashed his assailant in the belly with his bolo, and then forthwith took to \nflight, for the others continued to pursue him. Defendant attempts to show by \nthis testimony that he was through necessity defending himself from the unlawful \nassault made upon him by the deceased.<\/p>\n<p>But it appears fully proven in the case that the defendant Mallari did not go \nto Isidro Sunga's house to perform his wife's errand but that he went directly \nto another house, in which Vicente Sunga lived apart, to compel the latter to \ncure his sick wife; that when the defendant pursued him in the direction of the \nhouse of the <em>teniente<\/em> of the barrio, Sunga's wife, Canuta Flores, and \nher brother, Dalmacio Flores, came out of the house unarmed and saw the assault; \nthat upon approaching Sunga, whom they found seated on the ground with a wound \nin his belly, they rendered him aid. At that time the defendant, who had \nassaulted him, was no longer there, as he had straightway taken to flight. The \nagents of the authorities and the justice of the peace who went to the place of \nthe assault found no weapon in possession of the deceased, or of his wife and \nhis brother-in-law.<\/p>\n<p>Isidro Sunga, who lived in another house with Silvino Sunga and Florentino \nSunga, was not in his house at the time of the occurrence and none of these \npersons saw the affair, so they could not have pursued the defendant with \nweapons, as he affirms. The two neighbors, Bernardo Saual and Esteban Yama, who \nlived in houses adjoining the deceased's, stated that when they heard the cries \nof Canuta Flores calling for help they left their houses and thereupon saw the \ndefendant pursuing the deceased Vicente Sunga; that upon arriving in front of \nthe house of the teniente of the barrio, at the moment when Sunga turned toward \nthe defendant, who was pursuing him, said defendant slashed him in the belly and \nstraightway took to flight. They did not at that time see Sunga carrying any \nweapon, or that he attacked his assailant before being wounded in the belly.<\/p>\n<p>The witnesses for the defense, Bonifacio Ignacio and Diego Yabut, assert that \nthey saw four armed men pursuing the defendant on that occasion, the foremost of \nwhom was the deceased, who was carrying a pocket-knife, while the others were \nprovided with bolos, wherefore the defendant, upon being wounded in the right \nrump by the deceased, defended himself and slashed the latter with his bolo. To \noffset these declarations, the case affords positive proof that the defendant, \nwithout provocation or prior aggression, attacked the deceased with a bolo and \nwounded him in the belly.<\/p>\n<p>The affirmations of said witnesses cannot prevail against the testimony of \ntwo impartial neighbors who came up at the cries of the deceased's wife calling \nfor help and who, along with the brother-in-law of the wounded man, witnessed \nthe ocurrence and rendered him aid, without having seen those two witnesses of \nthe defense on the spot or the alleged prior aggression of the deceased against \nthe defendant.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, when the defendant was asked by the chief of police how he came to \nbe wounded in the rump, he replied that he did not know who had inflicted that \nwound, and this statement of the chief was not impugned at the trial, so it may \nbe that the defendant in preparing his defense wounded himself with a \npocket-knife, for the wound was of a trifling nature; and at the investigation \nheld by the justice of the peace who went to the defendant's house, the latter \nmade no statement regarding the person who had inflicted said wound, while the \nphysician who examined him said that it must have been received when he was \nstanding still.<\/p>\n<p>It does not therefore appear to be duly proven in the case that the defendant \nwas attacked and wounded with a pocket knife by the deceased, and consequently \nthat there was any prior unlawful aggression on the part of the deceased, to \njustify the finding that the defendant was compelled to wound him in the belly \nwith a bolo in lawful self-defense. The plea or circumstance of exemption from \nresponsibility must be fully proven in the same way as the principal fact, in \norder to hold that the perpetrator of the crime is not responsible therefor.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the classification of the criminal act, it does not appear \nin the case that this was erroneous, for in spite of the statement of the health \nofficer that the deceased might have been saved if the wound had been \naseptically treated from the first, its seriousness and fatal character being \ndue to lack of antiseptics, still the person inflicting it is responsible for \nall the consequences of his criminal action, and therefore for the death that \noccurred some days after the deceased received the wound.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to the third error assigned to the court for having held that \nthe declarations made by the deceased before the justice of the peace had the \ncharacter of <em>ante mortem<\/em> declarations, when the death of the deceased \ndid not occur for three days and the wound was not in itself of a fatal nature, \nit must be remembered that as a result of the wound inflicted upon the deceased \nhis intestines protruded and for this reason the wound was of a serious if not \nfatal nature. Therefore the opinion of the court with reference to the nature \nand force of the statements made by the victim before the justice of the peace \nat the time of the investigation is quite proper, because the credibility of \nstatements made by a person severely wounded rests not only on the serious \nsituation resulting from his wound but also on his physical and mental \ncondition, which, given the depressed state of his mind, has induced the \nprofound conviction that his life is actually slipping away, and that he la in \npositive and imminent danger of dying sooner or later from the wound; nor can \nthe force of such declaration be affected by the circumstance that he died \nlater, hours or days after it was inflicted, for when the patient did finally \ndie his death was due to the wound whose gravity did not diminish from the time \nhe made his declaration until the hour of his death.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Moore <em>vs.<\/em> State (96 Tenn., 209) the principle was \nmaintained that \"a dying declaration, otherwise competent, will not be excluded \nbecause it was made five days before death.\"<br\/><br\/>In the syllabus of the \ndecision in the case of Daughdrill <em>vs.<\/em> State (113 Ala., 7, 9) it is \nheld: \"Where it is shown that deceased had received a dangerous wound and stated \nseveral times that he was dying, and wanted witness to take a message to his \nwife, and was gasping for breath at the time he was talking, and trembling from \nfear or excitement, a sufficient predicate is laid for the admission of a \nstatement made at that time, as a dying declaration; and it is no objection to \nits admission that such declaration took the form of a message to another.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the syllabus of the decision rendered in the case of the United States \n<em>vs<\/em>. Castellon (12 Phil. Rep., 160) it is held: \"Notwithstanding the \nfact that hearsay evidence is not admissible at a trial, the statements made by \nan individual who is seriously wounded, at a moment when he was dying, being \nconvinced that there was no hope of recovery, constitute <em>per se<\/em> at \nleast a grave, conclusive and decisive indication of the culpability of the \npersons designated by the dying man, inasmuch as it must be assumed that he, \nbeing in so precarious a condition, spoke truthfully, and that he was not \ninduced by a desire to tell a lie and to injure an innocent person.\"<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment \nappealed from are refuted and said judgment found to be in accordance with the \nlaw and the merits of the case, it is affirmed, with the costs against the \nappellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Perez sold the land to Gregorio Patrocinio, deceased, the husband of the defendant, in the year 1894, for P100, and gave possession to the purchaser forthwith. Patrocinio continued in possession until he died, and from that time down to the date of the institution of this action in December, 1910, it was in the possession of the defendant, his widow. The sale to Patrocinio does not appear to have been executed in writing, though the fact that it did in fact take place is evidenced by a written receipt for the purchase price.<\/p> <p>The vendor Perez died in 1897 heavily indebted to the plaintiff, and his widow, in her capacity as administratrix of his estate, and acting under authority of an order of the court, executed in the year 1906 a deed of sale of a number of parcels of land, said to be the property of the estate of Perez, to the plaintiff company. Among the parcels of land mentioned in the deed is the land in question, and this deed was duly registered in the office of the register of deeds in the year 1906.<\/p> <p>It will be seen that upon these facts the principal question for determination is whether the unrecorded sale in 1894 of a duly registered parcel of land to Patrocinio, followed by possession under claim of ownership by himself and his successor in interest for twelve years, can prevail against the recorded deed to plaintiff company, which now seeks possession.<\/p> <p>We think that the mere statement of the case, read together with the pertinent provisions of the Civil Code, is conclusive of the disposition which must be made of it.<\/p> <p>Article 1473 of that code is as follows:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"If the same thing should have been sold to different vendees, the ownership shall be transferred to the person who may have first taken possession thereof in good faith, if it should be personal property.<\/p> <p>\"Should it be real property, it shall belong to the person acquiring it who first recorded it in the registry.<\/p> <p>\"Should there be no entry, the property shall belong to the person who first took possession of it in good faith, and, in the absence thereof, to the person who presents the oldest title, provided there is good faith.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>The property in question being registered real estate, it necessarily results that the right of the plaintiff company, which has had its title duly registered, must be held to prevail against the claim of the defendant, who, although she and her husband were in possession long prior to the sale to the plaintiff company, has never had her title registered.<\/p> <p>The trial judge was of opinion that: \"The wife of the deceased Tomas R. Perez had no right to sell this land, and if she did so, she could not transfer to the purchaser any title of ownership of the said land, which had already been sold by her deceased husband.\"<\/p> <p>It is not quite clear whether this holding was based on the ground that the land had been sold already by her deceased husband, or upon the ground that as such administratrix she had no authority to sell the real property of the estate.<\/p> <p>What has been said already sufficiently disposes of the first ground. It may be admitted that the land having been sold already, the widow should not have attempted to make it the subject of a second sale. But it appearing that the land in question was duly registered in the name of her deceased husband, and that she did in fact execute a deed of sale of this land in favor of the plaintiff company, the rights therein of the respective purchasers must be determined by the above cited provisions of the code\u2014if as administratrix of his estate, she was vested with authority to execute a valid deed of sale of real estate belonging to her husband.<\/p> <p>We are of opinion also, that in so far as the rulings of the lower court are based upon the supposed lack of power in the administratrix to sell real estate belonging to the estate of the deceased, the conclusions of the trial court cannot be sustained. Under the provisions of section 722 of Act No. 190, courts having jurisdiction of the real estate of deceased persons may grant licenses to administrators to sell such real estate in cases provided by law, and under the provisions of section 723 of that Act:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"The deed of an executor or administrator of the real estate of deceased persons, having such certificate or copy of an order of sale from the probate court, shall be as valid to convey the estate authorized to be sold as if the deed had been executed by the deceased in his lifetime.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>The deed of sale executed by the administratrix to the plaintiff company expressly declares that it was executed by authority of the court wherein the estate was in course of administration, and contains a copy of the order of that court expressly authorizing the sale of the property of the deceased. In the absence of any proof tending to put in doubt the genuineness and legality of the order of sale by virtue of which the administratrix avowedly undertook to execute the deed of sale, we do not think that we would be justified in holding that the deed thus executed is invalid.<\/p> <p>Let judgment be entered reversing the judgment entered in the court below, without costs in this instance, and directing that the record be returned to the trial court, where judgment will be entered in accordance herewith, and securing the rights of the defendant as an occupant in good faith.<\/p> <p><em>Arellano, C.

M. Moir, judge, wherein \nhe sentenced the defendant to make immediate delivery of the property in \nquestion, through a public instrument, by transferring and conveying to the \nplaintiff all his rights in the property described in the complaint and to pay \nit the sum of P780, as damages, and the costs of the suit.\n<p>On March 5, 1913, counsel for Gutierrez Hermanos filed a complaint, \nafterwards amended, in the Court of First Instance of Albay against Engracio \nOrense, in which he set forth that on and before February 14, 1907, the \ndefendant Orense had been the owner of a parcel of land, with the buildings and \nimprovements thereon, situated in the pueblo of Guinobatan, Albay, the location, \narea and boundaries of which were specified in the complaint; that the said \nproperty has up to date been recorded in the new property registry in the name \nof the said Orense, according to certificate No. 5, with the boundaries therein \ngiven; that, on February 14, 1907, Jose Duran, a nephew of the defendant, with \nthe latter's knowledge and consent, executed before a notary a public instrument \nwhereby he sold and conveyed to the plaintiff company, for P1,500, the \naforementioned property, the vendor Duran reserving to himself the right to \nrepurchase it for the same price within a period of four years from the date of \nthe said instrument; that the plaintiff company had not entered into possession \nof the purchased property, owing to its continued occupancy by the defendant and \nhis nephew, Jose Duran, by virtue of a contract of lease executed by the \nplaintiff to Duran, which contract was in force up to February 14, 1911; that \nthe said instrument of sale of the property, executed by Jose Duran, was \npublicly and freely confirmed and ratified by the defendant Orense in a verbal \ndeclaration made by him on March 14, 1912, in the Court of First Instance of \nAlbay, to the effect that the said instrument of sale was executed by Duran with \nthe knowledge and consent of the defendant, Orense; that, in order to perfect \nthe title to the said property, the plaintiff had to demand of the defendant \nthat he execute in legal form a deed pf conveyance of the property, but that the \ndefendant Orense refused to do so, without any justifiable cause or reason, \nwherefore he should be compelled to execute the said deed by an express order of \nthe court, for Jose Duran is notoriously insolvent and cannot reimburse the \nplaintiff company for the price of the sale which he received, nor pay any sum \nwhatever for the losses and damages occasioned by the said sale, aside from the \nfact that the plaintiff had suffered damage by losing the present value of the \nproperty, which was worth P3,000; that, unless such deed of final conveyance \nwere executed in behalf of the plaintiff company, it would be injured by the \nfraud perpetrated by the vendor, Duran, in connivance with the defendant; that \nthe latter had been occupying the said property since February 14, 1911, and \nrefused to pay the rental thereof, notwithstanding the demand made upon him for \nits payment at the rate of P30 per month, the just and reasonable value for the \noccupancy of the said property, the possession of which the defendant likewise \nrefused to deliver to the plaintiff company, in spite of the continuous demands \nmade upon him, the defendant, with bad faith and to the prejudice of the firm of \nGutierrez Hermanos, claiming to have rights of ownership and possession in the \nsaid property. Therefore it was prayed that judgment be rendered by holding that \nthe land and improvements in question belong legitimately and exclusively to the \nplaintiff, and ordering the defendant to execute in the plaintiff's behalf the \nsaid instrument of transfer and conveyance of the property and of all the right, \ninterest, title and share which the defendant has therein; that the defendant be \nsentenced to pay P30 per month for damages and rental of the property from \nFebruary 14, 1911, to the date of the restitution of the property to the \nplaintiff, and that, in case these remedies were not granted to the plaintiff, \nthe defendant be sentenced to pay to it the sum of P3,000 as damages, together \nwith interest thereon since the date of the institution of this suit, and to pay \nthe costs and other legal expenses.<\/p>\n<p>The demurrer filed to the amended complaint was over-ruled, with exception on \nthe part of the defendant, whose counsel made a general denial of the \nallegations contained in the complaint, excepting those, that were admitted, and \nspecifically denied paragraph 4 thereof to the effect that on February 14, 1907, \nJose Duran executed the deed of sale of the property in favor of the plaintiff \nwith the defendant's knowledge and consent.<\/p>\n<p>As the first special defense, counsel for the defendant alleged that the \nfacts set forth in the complaint with respect to the execution of the deed did \nnot constitute a cause of action, nor did those alleged in the other form of \naction for the collection of P3,000, the value of the realty.<\/p>\n<p>As the second special defense, he alleged that the defendant was the lawful \nowner of the property claimed in the complaint, as his ownership was recorded in \nthe property registry, and that, since his title had been registered under the \nproceedings <em>in rem<\/em> prescribed by Act No. 496, it was conclusive against \nthe plaintiff and the pretended rights alleged to have been acquired by Jose \nDuran prior to such registration could not now prevail; that the defendant had \nnot executed any written power of attorney nor given any verbal authority to \nJose Duran in order that the latter might, in his name and representation, sell \nthe said property to the plaintiff company; that the defendant's knowledge of \nthe said sale was acquired long after the execution of the contract of sale \nbetween Duran and Gutierrez Hermanos, and that prior thereto the defendant did \nnot intentionally and deliberately perform any act such as might have induced \nthe plaintiff to believe that Duran was empowered and authorized by the \ndefendant and which would warrant him in acting to his own detriment, under the \ninfluence of that belief. Counsel therefore prayed that the defendant be \nabsolved from the complaint and that the plaintiff be sentenced to pay the costs \nand to hold his peace forever.<\/p>\n<p>After the hearing of the case and an examination of the evidence introduced \nby both parties, the court rendered the judgment aforementioned, to which \ncounsel for the defendant excepted and moved for a new trial. This motion was \ndenied, an exception was taken by the defendant and, upon presentation of the \nproper bill of exceptions, the same was approved, certified and forwarded to the \nclerk of this court.<\/p>\n<p>This suit involves the validity and efficacy of the sale under right of \nredemption of a parcel of land and a masonry house with a <em>nipa<\/em> roof \nerected thereon, effected by Jose Duran, a nephew of the owner of the property, \nEngracio Orense, for the sum of P1,500 by means of a notarial instrument \nexecuted and ratified on February 14, 1907. <\/p>\n<p>After the lapse of the four years stipulated for the redemption, the \ndefendant refused to deliver the property to the purchaser, the firm of \nGutierrez Hermanos, and to pay the rental thereof at the rate of P30 per month \nfor its use and occupation since February 14, 1911, when the period for its \nrepurchase terminated. His refusal was based on the allegations that he had been \nand was then the owner of the said property, which was registered in his name in \nthe property registry; that he had not executed any written power of attorney to \nJose Duran, nor had he given the latter any verbal authorization to sell the \nsaid property to the plaintiff firm in his name; and that, prior to the \nexecution of the deed of sale, the defendant performed no act such as might have \ninduced the plaintiff to believe that Jose Duran was empowered and authorized by \nthe defendant to effect the said sale.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff firm, therefore, charged Jose Duran, in the Court of First \nInstance of the said province, with estafa, for having represented himself in \nthe said deed of sale to be the absolute owner of the aforesaid land and \nimprovements, whereas in reality they did not belong to him, but to the \ndefendant Orense. However, at the trial of the case Engracio Orense, called as a \nwitness, being interrogated by the fiscal as to whether he had consented to \nDuran's selling the said property under right of redemption to the firm of \nGutierrez Hermanos, replied that he had. In view of this statement by the \ndefendant, the court acquitted Jose Duran of the charge of estafa.<\/p>\n<p>As a result of the acquittal of Jose Duran, based on the explicit testimony \nof his uncle, Engracio Orense, the owner of the property, to the effect that he \nhad consented to his nephew Duran's selling the property under right of \nrepurchase to Gutierrez Hermanos, counsel for this firm filed a complaint \npraying, among other remedies, that the defendant Orense be compelled to execute \na deed for the transfer and conveyance to the plaintiff company of all the \nright, title and interest which Orense had in the property sold, and to pay to \nthe same the rental of the property due from February 14, 1911.<\/p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the allegations of the defendant, the record in this case \nshows that he did give his consent in order that his nephew, Jose Duran, might \nsell the property in question to Gutierrez Hermanos, (and that he did thereafter \nconfirm and ratify the sale by means of a public instrument executed before a \nnotary.<\/p>\n<p>It having been proven at the trial that he gave his consent to the said sale, \nit follows that the defendant conferred verbal, or at least implied, power of \nagency upon his nephew Duran, who accepted it in the same way by selling the \nsaid property. The principal must therefore fulfill all the obligations \ncontracted by the agent, who acted within the scope of his authority. (Civil \nCode, arts, 1709, 1710 and 1727.)<\/p>\n<p>Even should it be held that the said consent was granted subsequently to the \nsale, it is unquestionable that the defendant, the owner of the property, \napproved the action of his nephew, who in this case acted as the manager of his \nuncle's business, and Orense's ratification produced the effect of an express \nauthorization to make the said sale. (Civil Code, arts. 1888 and 1892.)<\/p>\n<p>Article 1259 of the Civil Code prescribes: \"No one can contract in the name \nof another without being authorized by him or without having his legal \nrepresentation according to law.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A contract executed in the name of another by one who has neither his \nauthorization nor legal representation shall be void, unless it should be \nratified by the person in whose name it was executed before being revoked by the \nother contracting party.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The sworn statement made by the defendant, Orense, while testifying as a \nwitness at the trial of Duran for estafa, virtually confirms and ratifies the \nsale of his property effected by his nephew, Duran, and, pursuant to article \n1313 of the Civil Code, remedies all defects which the contract may have \ncontained from the moment of its execution. <\/p>\n<p>The sale of the said property made by Duran to Gutierrez Hermanos was indeed \nnull and void in the beginning, but afterwards became perfectly valid and cured \nof the defect of nullity it bore at its execution by the confirmation solemnly \nmade by the said owner upon his stating under oath to the judge that he himself \nconsented to his nephew Jose Duran's making the said sale. Moreover, pursuant to \narticle 1309 of the Code, the right of action for nullification that could have \nbeen brought became legally extinguished from the moment the contract was \nvalidly confirmed and ratified, and, in the present case, it is unquestionable \nthat the defendant did confirm the said contract of sale and consent to its \nexecution.<\/p>\n<p>On the testimony given by Engracio Orense at the trial of Duran for estafa, \nthe latter was acquitted, and it would not be just that the said testimony, \nexpressive of his consent to the sale of his property, which determined the \nacquittal of his nephew, Jose Duran, who then acted as his business manager, and \nwhich testimony wiped out the deception that in the beginning appeared to have \nbeen practiced by the said Duran, should not now serve in passing upon the \nconduct of Engracio Orense in relation to the firm of Gutierrez Hermanos in \norder to prove his consent to the sale of his property, for, had it not been for \nthe consent admitted by the defendant Orense, the plaintiff would have been the \nvictim of estafa.<\/p>\n<p>If the defendant Orense acknowledged and admitted under oath that he had \nconsented to Jose Duran's selling the property in litigation to Gutierrez \nHermanos, it is not just nor is it permissible for him afterward to deny that \nadmission, to the prejudice of the purchaser, who gave P1,500 for the said \nproperty.<\/p>\n<p>The contract of sale of the said property contained in the notarial \ninstrument of February 14, 1907, is alleged to be invalid, null and void under \nthe provisions, of paragraph 5 of section 335 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \nbecause the authority which Orense may have given to Duran to make the said \ncontract of sale is not shown to have been in writing and signed by Orense, but \nthe record discloses satisfactory and conclusive proof that the defendant Orense \ngave his consent to the contract of sale executed in a public instrument by his \nnephew Jose Duran. Such consent was proven in a criminal action by the sworn \ntestimony of the principal and presented in this civil suit by other sworn \ntestimony of the same principal and by other evidence to which the defendant \nmade no objection. Therefore the principal is bound to abide by the consequences \nof his agency as though it had actually been given in writing. (Conlu \n<em>vs.<\/em> Araneta and Guanko, 15 Phil.

The plaintiff, through its agent Behn, Meyer &amp; \nCo., Limited, was the sole vendor of a certain kind of wax candles. They were \nput up in packages of two sizes, wrapped in blue paper, to which was affixed a \nprice of paper, in the form of a label, upon which were printed and impressed \nthe trade name and style of that class of candles, consisting of certain \npeculiar and special pictures, signs, forms, designs, and colors which, taken \ntogether, distingushed a package containing that class of candles from all \nothers then on the market.\n<p>The allegations of the complaint are that the defendant knowing that the \nplaintiff, by industry and expense and by long lapse of time, had established a \nlarge trade in these candles, obtained the manufacture in Japan of a trade name, \nmark or label approximating very closely both in scheme, form, pictures, design, \ncolor, and style that of the plaintiff in this case.

Taking this in connection with the fact that the packages were \nput up in substantially the same size and form and wrapped in exactly the same \nkind and color of paper, and we have a situation presented which demonstrates \nthat the ordinary purchaser of that article would very probably be deceived into \npurchasing defendant's candles instead of plaintiff's although he had \ntheretofore been a regular customer of the latter and at the moment desired to \npurchase its candles.<\/p>\n<p>The trial court found that the similarity between the trade label of the two \nclasses of candles was such as to produce unfair competition and upon an \naccounting by the defendant found the damages to be P661.56. This appeal is from \nthat judgment.<\/p>\n<p>Section 7 of Act No. 666 provides that \"Any person who in selling his goods \nshall give them the general appearance of goods of another manufacturer or \ndealer, either in the wrapping of the packages in which they are contained, or \nthe devices or words thereon, or in any other feature of their appearance, which \nwould be likely to influence purchasers to believe that the goods offered are \nthose of a manufacturer or dealer other than the actual manufacturer or dealer, \nand who clothes the goods with such appearance for the purpose of deceiving the \npublic and defrauding another of his legitimate trade, or any subsequent vendor \nof such goods or any agent of any vendor engaged in selling such goods with a \nlike purpose, shall be guilty of unfair competition, and shall be liable to an \naction for damages, in which the measure shall be the same as that provided for \na violation of trademark rights, together with discretionary power in the court \nto impose double damages, if the circumstances call for the same. * * *.\"<\/p>\n<p>We believe that the evidence fully sustains the trial court in the conclusion \nthat this section was violated by the defendant in this case. A glance at the \npackages as they come before us shows a striking similarity, both in form, color \nand general appearance, in the trade label attached to the packages. Moreover, \nwe find the boxes in which the candles are shipped to be substantially the same \nin both cases. Those of the defendant approximate very closely those of the \nplaintiff in size, appearance and method of fastening, as well as the words \nprinted thereon. Taken all in all, the attempt to imitate is so clear that we do \nnot go into a discussion of the particular details which constitute the \nsimilarity.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs<\/p>\n<p>against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The \ncomplaint alleged that on or about the 18th day of July, 1913, in the sitio of \nDelawan, within the jurisdiction of the settlement of Balabad, Province of \nPalawan, Philippine Islands, the above-named accused, in a band armed with \ndeadly weapons, intentionally, voluntarily, criminally, and for the purpose of \nstealing personal property, attacked the house of Loudon, situated in the \n<em>sitio <\/em>of Delawan, and by use of violence and intimidation against \npersons and force upon property, with intent to gain, took possession of rice, \nclothing, jewelry, and other personal effects belonging to Loudon, to the total \namount of P700; that in making said attack, said accused willfully, \ndeliberately, and treacherously assaulted Mrs. Cornelia Loudon, her baby named \nNellie, Eusebio Quiron, Carlota Quiron, Esteban Cervantes, Alejo Diaz, Vicente \nCabanillas, and Simeon Maglumot, inflicting upon each of them several wounds, \nwhich caused their sudden and violent death, all contrary to the statute in such \ncases made and provided.\n<p>The said defendants were duly arrested, arraigned, and tried. Some of them at \nthe close of the trial were acquitted and some of them were convicted. None of \nthem appealed. The defendants, Mandani and Paria, haying been sentenced to \ndeath, the cause relating to them was brought here \"en consulta\" in accordance \nwith the provisions of section 4 of Act No. 194 of the United States Philippine \nCommission.<\/p>\n<p>From an examination of the record brought to this court, we find that the \nfollowing facts seem to be proven, beyond a reasonable doubt:<\/p>\n<p>First. That upon the 18th day of July, 1913, and for some time prior thereto, \na corporation known as \"The Delawan Bay Company,\" existed and was doing business \nin the <em>sitio<\/em> of Delawan, settlement of Balabac, Province of \nPalawan.<\/p>\n<p>Second. That said corporation was under the management and control of Thomas \nF. Loudon.<\/p>\n<p>Third. That said corporation, in addition to its other business, kept and \noperated a store upon the lands belonging, to the company and had a house or \nbuilding in which Loudon, the manager, lived with his family.<\/p>\n<p>Fourth. That several weeks before the said 18th day of July, 1913, the said \nLoudon, having noticed that the people; of the settlement were growing uneasy \nand somewhat excited concerning conditions of which he had no knowledge, asked \nfor and obtained a detachment of Philippine Scouts, to be located in the \n<em>sitio<\/em> of Delawan, for the purposes of protection, as well as to \nmaintain peace and good order.<\/p>\n<p>Fifth. The Scouts, after having been in said <em>sitio<\/em> for some weeks, \nleft for other parts early in the morning of the 18th of July, 1913.<\/p>\n<p>Sixth. That about an hour and a half or two hours after the Scouts had left \nthe sitio of Delawan, some of the defendants appeared at the house and store of \nLoudon, on the pretext of asking for quinine. The lower court found that their \npurpose was not to secure quinine, but to ascertain whether or not the Scouts \nhad left. These defendants, without buying the quinine, left the house of Loudon \nand very soon after many Moros approached the house of Loudon from two \ndirections, all of them being armed with barongs or badongs, krisses and lances. \n<\/p>\n<p>Seventh. It appears that Loudon and his wife, Cornelia, were out in the yard \nof their house when they saw the said Moros. Mrs. Loudon at once ran into the \nhouse. Loudon approached said Moros for the purpose of ascertaining what they \ndesired. He at once noted their intimidating attitude and tried to escape to his \nhouse also, but was prevented by the intervention of said band. He thereupon \nescaped in the direction of the sea and was followed by a number of the band to \nthe edge of the sea. Loudon, upon reaching the sea, entered and swam out some \ntwo miles distant from the shore to a place of safety.<\/p>\n<p>Eighth. On the following day Loudon, with an expedition, returned to the \nhouse where his family had lived, and found his wife dead, with cuts across her \nback and with her arms cut into three or four separate pieces. He found his \nchild, Nellie, also dead in her bed, with a cut at the base of the skull, and \nthe left side of her face wholly cut off. Later the bodies of Eusebio Quiron, \nCarlota Quiron, Esteban Cervantes, Alejo Diaz, Vicente CabaniJIas, and Simeon \nMaglumot were found dead and were duly identified.<\/p>\n<p>Ninth. The said expedition entered the house where Loudon and his family had \nlived and found that the same had been rifled and despoiled of its contents. A \nbed and some table linen, clothing, and wearing apparel had been carried away. \nThe cash box of the corporation had been opened and P40 taken therefrom. It was \nalso found that merchandise had been taken out of said store, amounting in value \nto about P400.<\/p>\n<p>Tenth. Later a detachment of Scouts and Filipinos who had volunteered for the \nexpedition, captured the Moro band, killing some of them and capturing others. \nThe said defendants were among those captured.<\/p>\n<p>Eleventh. After the defendants had been arrested, many of them confessed \nfreely and voluntarily, without any intimidation or compulsion, to the \nparticipation of themselves and others in the robbery and murder committed as \nabove described.<\/p>\n<p>Twelfth. Loudon identified practically every one of the defendants. He said \nthat each of them had been working for his corporation. In addition to the \nconfession made by some of the defendants, in which they narrated their own \nparticipation in the commission of the robbery and murder, and the participation \nwhich others took in said robbery arid murder, we have the declaration of an \neyewitness, Feliciano Castro, the cook of Loudon, who was present and saw from a \nwindow in the kitchen of the house of Loudon, the horrible crimes committed as \nabove described.<\/p>\n<p>In view of the fact that there are only two defendants before this court, we \ndeem it unnecessary to discuss the participation of the other defendants in the \ncommission of the crime charged. The only two defendants before this court are \nMandani and Paria. In addition to the testimony of some of the codefendants and \nthe confession of the others, we have the positive testimony of Loudon and \nFeliciano Castro to the effect that the said Mandani and Paria were present at \nthe time of the robbery and murder and took a direct part therein; that they \nwere the leaders and chief men of the band and as such were legally and \npersonally responsible for the crimes committed. For the reason that they were \nthe leaders and chief men of the band the lower court imposed upon them the most \nsevere penalty provided for by the law. Many of the other defendants were let \noff with a very light penalty, because of their ignorance, and because of the \nfact that they had been induced simply to become members of the band. The \nevidence seems to demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Paria not only \nacted as one of the leaders of the band and as one of the chief men, but that he \nactually assisted in killing Eusebio Quiron. There does not seem, however, to be \nany direct and positive evidence showing that Mandani, with his own hands, \nactually inflicted any of the blows which caused the death of any of the persons \nnamed in the complaint. The proof does show, however, that he was present and \nacted more or less as a chief or head man of the band during all their marauding \nin and about the house of the said Loudon.<\/p>\n<p>The concert of the action of the two bands which arrived at the house of \nLoudon simultaneously from two directions, and their joint cooperation in \nattacking Loudon and the inhabitants of his house and robbing the same, taken \ntogether with the fact that three men, members of one or the other of said \nbands, went to the house evidently as spies a short time before the two bands \narrived, convince us that there was a conspiracy on the part of the members of \nsaid band to commit the crimes which they committed. There being a conspiracy, \neach of the conspirators is liable for the crimes which were committed under the \nconspiracy. When two or more persons agree or conspire to commit a crime, each \nis responsible for all the acts of the others, done in the furtherance of the \nagreement or conspiracy. (U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Grant, 18 Phil. Rep., 122.) In a \nconspiracy every act of one of the conspirators, in the furtherance of a common \ndesign or purpose of such conspiracy, is, in the contemplation of the law, the \nact of each one of them. (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Gooding, 12 Wheaton, 460; Lincoln \n<em>vs.<\/em> Claflin, 7 Wallace (U. S.), 132; Logan <em>vs.<\/em> United States, \n144 U. S., 263; Boyd <em>vs.<\/em> United States, 142 U. S., 450.)<\/p>\n<p>After a careful consideration of the record and all of the evidence brought \nto this court, we are persuaded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants \nare guilty of the crime charged and that the penalty imposed by the lower court \nis justified by the evidence and the law. The same is, therefore, hereby \naffirmed with costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Homicide is a mere incident of the robbery, the \nlatter being the main purpose and object of the criminal. As is clearly seen by \narticle 503 of the Penal Code, robbery with homicide is committed when it is \nshown that there was a homicide which occurred \"in consequence or on the \noccasion of the robbery.\" It has been held by the supreme court of Spain, and \napproved by the great commentator Viada, that where a person is killed and \nrobbed afterwards and it is\" shown that the authors of the crime had agreed \namong themselves to rob the man but planned to kill him first in order that he \nshould be unable to identify or testify against them, two crimes were committed, \nnamely, murder and robbery, the first of which the Spanish court regarded as a \nnecessary means of committing the second; and as a logical and inevitable \nconclusion article 89 of the Penal Code was held to be applicable and the \naccused was punished for the highest crime in its maximum degree. (Decisions of \nsupreme court of Spain of 23rd of August, 1872, and 13th of July, 1880; 3 Viada, \n348.) That doctrine, however, seems to have been modified by a decision of the \nsupreme court of Spain of the 29th of July, 1880. Viada, discussing these \nopposing decisions, unhesitatingly declares the doctrine stated in the judgments \nof the 23rd of August, 1872, and the 13th of July, 1880, to be the correct \ndoctrine. Comparing the doctrine laid down in those two decisions with that in \nthe subsequent decision of the 29th of July, 1880 and answering the question \nwhich of the two doctrines is preferable, Viada says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We do not hesitate to assert that it is the first construetion that is the \nmost in harmony with the law. Article 516, paragraph 1, is very clear; it treats \nof robbery on account of or on the occasion of which homicide <em>results.<\/em> \nIf this latter crime is not the result, a consequence, of the robbery, but, on \nthe contrary, <em>precedes<\/em> it, is schemed in cold blood and with \npremeditation and, as in the case at bar, is carried into execution with the \nmost atrocious treachery for the purpose of robbing afterwards, then the case \ndoes not fall within the purview of article 516, paragraph 1, for the crime is \nnot that of homicide, but of <em>murder<\/em>, nor was this latter crime a \nconsequence of the robbery, but was a prior act, precedent thereto, carried into \nexecution, not by reason of or on the occasion of the robbery, that is, \n<em>while<\/em> the robbery was being committed, so as to avoid any hindrance, or \n<em>after<\/em> its commission, in order to efface the traces of the crime, but \n<em>prior<\/em> to the commission of the robbery and was perpetrated with \ndeliberation and premeditation, as a principal and necessary act and in no wise \nas a consequential incident of the robbery.\" (3 Viada, 349.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From the observations of Viada it is clear that, before the crime of robbery \nwith homicide can be committed, the homicide must be in reality a \n<em>homicide<\/em> and not murder. But when, as says Viada, a criminal, with \nreflection and premeditation, commits a homicide as the primary act and \nthereafter commits in addition a robbery, the crime is not robbery with<em> \nhomicide<\/em> but robbery with <em>murder<\/em>, a crime unknown to the Penal \nCode. I repeat, when the crime against the person is <em>murder<\/em> and not \nhomicide, the crime cannot be robbery with homicide, because there is no \nhomicide.<\/p>\n<p>In the case before us the primary and principal purpose of the Moros, a part \nof whom are the defendants in this case, was to murder Loudon and his family. \nThey particularly wanted to murder Loudon. This is evidenced by the fact that \nthey went to his place once or twice and, not finding him, stayed their hands \nuntil they did find him, when they immediately attacked him and his family, \nmurdering all that were unable to escape. The robbery was evidently a mere \nincident; as Viada calls it, an \"accidente.\"<\/p>\n<p>I am inclined to believe, therefore, that the crime is murder <em>and<\/em> \nrobbery and not robbery with homicide. A number of statements made in the \nopinion indicate that there was a conspiracy to murder and the evidence \nindisputably demonstrates that there was such a conspiracy and that there was an \nagreement on the part of the accused and the others, to murder Loudon.<\/p>\n<p>The court has not always strictly adhered to the principles herein laid down \nand on one or two occasions has convicted of robbery with homicide when there \nshould have been a conviction for murder <em>and<\/em> robbery. The sentence \nbeing the same in this particular case whether the crime charged be robbery with \nhomicide or murder and robbery, I do not object to the sentence imposed. My only \npurpose is to prevent the principles governing the two classes of crime from \nbeing confused. Aside from the mere confusion itself, which should always be \navoided by a judicial tribunal, serious results might follow to the criminal or \nto the public by such confusion.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

From \nthis judgment defendant has appealed.<\/p>\n<p>The only important question in controversy in this case, according to \ndefendant's counsel, is the following: Did the defendant, Leandro de Vera, \ncontract marriage with Modesta Lamadrid in Indan, Ambos Camarines, before \nmarrying Guadalupe Samarita on June 21,1913?<\/p>\n<p>Defendant's counsel answers this question in the negative and in support of \nhis contention alleges that the lower court erred, first, in admitting in \nevidence a certain entry made on page 127 of the marriage register of the parish \nof Indan, Ambos Camarines, dated January 7, 1907, and the alleged copy of the \nsaid entry, Exhibit A of the prosecution; second, in finding that on the said \ndate, January 7, 1907, defendant, Leandro de Vera, was united in marriage to the \nsaid Modesta Lamadrid.<\/p>\n<p>The introduction by the prosecution, at the trial, of the entry in the said \nmarriage register as proof of the fact that Leandro de Vera had contracted \nmarriage, in accordance with the ritual of the Catholic Church, with Modesta \nLamadrid, in Indan, Ambos Camarines, on January 7, 1907, was effected through \nFather Salomon Balani, the parish priest of the church in the a forementioned \npueblo, who, in such capacity, was charged with the custody and preservation of \nthe books of the said parish. On this occasion Father Balani personally examined \nthe said entry or record and showed it to the court, as well as the page where \nFather Mariano Bamba had recorded and where there appeared an entry of the \nsolemnization of the said marriage before the acting parish priest of the said \npueblo, on the date aforementioned, January 7, 1907, after compliance with the \nrequirements and formalities imposed by the Catholic ritual. At the foot of this \nentry there appears Father Bamba's signature, identified by the witness, Father \nBalani, as being that of his predecessor in that parish, who, he testified, \nmarried the contracting parties, or, which amounts to the same thing, had \nsolemnized the said marriage. As the book wherein the said entry or record was \nmade was necessarily required for use by the parish of Indan, and as the \nprosecution had requested to be permitted to attach to the records of the case a \ncertified copy of the said entry in place of the original, the court granted the \npetition and the copy presented was marked as Exhibit A of the prosecution. The \ndefendant did not assail the authenticity of the said original entry nor that of \nthe book which contained it, nor did he object to the inclusion of the said \ncertified copy among the records of the case, but merely objected to the \npresentation of the aforementioned original entry, though he took no exception \nto its admission.<\/p>\n<p>It is true that section 20 of the Municipal Code, invoked by the defense, \nprescribes among the duties of the municipal secretaries that of keeping a civil \nregister in which they must record all the marriages that take place in their \nrespective municipalities, and that of issuing certificates of documents under \ntheir charge; it further provides, in connection with preceding clauses, that \nevery person residing within the limits of the municipality who is authorized by \nlaw to celebrate marriages shall immediately forward to the municipal secretary \na notification of every marriage which he celebrates. It is likewise true that \nsection 7 of General Orders No. 68 also prescribes that the person solemnizing a \nmarriage must draw up and sign a certificate containing a record of the same and \ntransmit a copy of such certificate to the justice of the peace court. However, \nthese provisions have not deprived the priests and ministers of the gospel of \nany religion and other persons authorized by section 5 of the same general \norders, amended by General Orders No. 70, of the right nor have they been \nexempted from the duty of keeping registry or record books of the marriages \nsolemnized by them, or issuing certificates of such data, with respect to these \nacts, as may appear in their respective registers; nor do such provisions \nprescribe that only, certificates of marriages recorded by municipal \nsecretaries, in the registers of their respective municipalities and issued by \nthem shall authenticate or be evidence of such facts in such wise that no other \nproof of those provided for by law may be presented or admitted at trial, when, \nthrough the omission or fault either of the municipal secretary himself or of \nthe person who solemnized the marriage, it was not entered or recorded in the \nregister to which these provisions refer.<\/p>\n<p>Civil marriage is not the only form established in these Islands, for, as \naforesaid, priests or ministers of the gospel of any religion are empowered to \nsolemnize marriages, according to the laws now in force. This power implies that \nthey may keep registers of the marriages celebrated by them and issue \ncertificates therefrom. On the other hand, no record can be made in the civil \nregister of municipal secretaries but of the marriages reported to them by those \nwho solemnized them, so that the certificates issued by the said officials \nattest the entry of marriages so reported to them in the book used for the \npurpose. This registration or formality may sometimes be omitted by the person \ncharged therewith, thus rendering it impossible for the municipal secretary to \nissue a. certificate of the marriage. There is, therefore, no reason whatever \nwhy, in the absence of such a certificate, as occurs in the case at bar, the \nbest proof of the solemnization of the marriage should not be the entry or \nrecord made in the book kept for the purpose by the priest or minister who \nsolemnized it, or the certificate, issued in due form by a competent person, of \nsuch entry or record, in place of the certificate which the municipal secretary \ncould have issued if the marriage had been recorded in the register under his \ncharge, in conformity with the provisions of the said section 20 of the \nMunicipal Code invoked by defendant's counsel.<\/p>\n<p>Bishop, in his work on Marriage, Divorce and Separation, (vol. 1, par. 1009), \nsays: \"The statutes of many of our States make it the duty of those to whom the \nsolemnization of marriage is entrusted to keep a record of their marriages, and \ntransmit lists of them from time to time to a general recording officer, to be \nby the latter recorded. Since, therefore, the first record is made and kept, in \npursuance of law, by one who as to marriage solemnization is a public officer, \nno reason appears why it, or his certificate of its contents, should not be just \nas good in evidence as the general record, or the certificate thereof.\"<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, as the marriage register wherein, appears the record of the \nmarriage alleged to have been solemnized between Leandro de Vera and Modesta \nLamadrid in the pueblo of Indan, Ambos Camarines, on January 7, 1907, does not \nbelong to Father Mariano Bamba, who, according to that entry, solemnized the \nsaid marriage and by whom, as the parish priest of the said pueblo, the said \nentry appears to have been signed, but belongs to the Roman Catholic Church, \nwhich is a juridical entity (Barlin <em>vs<\/em>. Ramirez, 7 Phil. Rep., 41), and \nof which Father Bamba was then the representative in the said pueblo, the \nintroduction of the said entry as well as of the book containing it, by Father \nSalomon Balani, the parish priest of the said pueblo and successor of the said \nFather Bamba on the date of the trial, and his-testimony with respect to the \nauthenticity of the document and the truth of the facts therein set forth, \nproduce the same effects as if such presentation had been made and such \ntestimony had been given by the said Father Mariano Bamba, inasmuch as they \nrelate to an act performed by a representative of that juridical entity in the \nexercise of his ecclesiastical duties and recorded in a book of the said entity \nduring the course of its business.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Blackburn <em>vs<\/em>. Crawford's Lessee (3 Wall., 175), where \nthe appellant objected to the admission in evidence of an entry made in a \nbaptismal register because the minister or priest who had made the said entry \nwas still living and was within reach or could be called and should have been \nexamined with regard to the point at issue, the court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"They (the appellants) proved that the book was the baptismal register of St. \nPatrick's Church, in the city of Washington; that the ritual and usage of the \nchurch required such a register to be kept, and baptisms to be entered in it; \nand that this entry was in the handwriting of the Rev. John P. Donelan, who, at \nthis date, was assistant pastor of the church. The plaintiff in error objected \nto the evidence as inadmissible for any purpose. If admitted, he claimed that it \nwas competent to prove only the fact and date of the baptism. The court \noverruled both objections and admitted the entry as evidence, 'as well of the \nfact of the said baptism, and of the date thereof, as of the fact that the said \nGeorge T. Crawford was baptized as the lawful child of Thomas B. Crawford and \nElizabeth Taylor, his wife.'<\/p>\n<p>\"The register was admissible upon the ground that the entries in it were made \nby the writer in the ordinary course of his business.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Bishop, in his aforecited work (vol. 1, par. 1013), added with reference to \nthe decision above mentioned: \"The same rule, it was deemed, would be equally \napplicable to records kept, pursuant to ecclesiastical rule, within any other \nreligious denomination.\"<\/p>\n<p>In another case, that of Kennedy vs. Doyle (92 Mass., 161), where the priest \nwho made the entry of the baptism in the proper register had already died when \nthe said entry was presented as evidence, the court said: \"The entry of a \nbaptism, contemporaneously made by a Roman Catholic priest, in the discharge of \nhis ecclesiastical duty, in his church records of baptisms, is competent \nevidence after his death, of the date of the baptism, if the book is produced \nfrom the proper custody; although he was not a sworn officer, and the record was \nnot by law required to be kept.\"<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, in the case of Jacobi <em>vs.<\/em> Order of Germania (26 N. Y. Sup., \n318), where an attempt was made to present a baptismal certificate to prove the \nage of the person interested in the suit, the court said: \"These certificates \nwere proven to have been written in the official records of the church books of \nKatzhutte, principality of Schwarzburg Rudolstadt. This record is kept by \ndirection of the supervisor of schools and churches, and was kept by the pastor \nof the parish, and has been kept from time immemorial. At the date of the \nrecords a Mr. Kuhne was pastor, and the records are in his handwriting. The \nbooks were delivered by him to the successor as pastor of the parish, the \nReverend M. Huke, who testifies to the truth of the record, and to the copies \nfrom it. The certificates of baptism of the children of the plaintiff, including \nthe deceased son, were made by the pastors Ortloff and Toupell, and are without \nchange or erasure, and are admitted to be true copies, and admissible if the \noriginal record be legal evidence. We think the certificates should have been \nreceived. If a record is of a public nature, such as this of a church, an \nexamined copy of the entries relied on without production of the original is \nadmissible.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the case at bar the book or register of marriages which the prosecution \npresented at the trial, through Father Salomon Balani, and in which, on page 127 \nthereof, is found the entry or record of the marriage In question, is the sixth \none of its kind of the Roman Catholic parish of Indan, Ambos Camarines. It was \nopened on June 11, 1899, was authorized by the bishop of the diocese of the same \nchurch, was kept in the archives of the said parish and records were therein \nmade in conformity with the rules and precepts of the Roman Catholic religion. \nThe entry in question was made and signed by the then parish priest of the \npueblo, Father Mariano Bamba, on the same date on which the marriage referred to \nwas celebrated, in the course and fulfillment of his ecclesiastical duties, in \naccordance with the ritual and usages of the said Roman Catholic Church and in \nconnection with the duties imposed upon persons authorized to solemnize \nmarriages, pursuant to the provisions of the aforementioned General Orders No. \n68, and in due compliance with such duty. The copy introduced at the trial, in \nsubstitution of the said entry, is a literal one and was issued and certified by \nFather Salomon Balani, parish priest of the said pueblo of Indan, successor of \nFather Mariano Bamba who solemnized the said marriage, and charged in his \ncapacity of parish priest with the custody of the books kept in the archives of \nthe parish, and also of the parish seal. Father Salomon Balani was present at \nthe trial when the prosecution requested that the said copy be attached as \nevidence to the record of the case, in place of its original which, as \naforesaid, was then and there presented with the book that contained it; and the \ndefendant made no objection to that request, but merely to the introduction of \nthe original entry or record shown in the said book.<\/p>\n<p>Taking into account, then, the provisions of the existing laws on marriaga, \ncontained in General Orders Nos. 68 and 70 and in the Municipal Code, previously \nmentioned, as well as the doctrine established in the decisions hereinabove \ncited, which latter refer to baptismal registers, although they are applicable \nto the case at bar on account of the similarity between such registers and those \nof marriages, a doctrine that should be accepted and applied in the courts of \nthese Islands, in view of the present character of the institution of marriage \nunder the said general orders, which differs from that which it possessed under \nthe previous system of legislation; and duly considering the several forms of \nmarriage authorized by the same general orders, in connection with the \nformalities established by the said new legislation for the purpose of recording \nmarriages in a general register, provided for in an incomplete and deficient \nmanner even by those provisions, there can be no doubt whatever that the entry \nof a record contained in the said register of the Roman Catholic parish of \nIndan, Ambos Camarines, and which records the marriage contracted by Leandro de \nVera and Modesta Lamadrid on January 7, 1907, before Father Mariano Bamba, is \ncompetent evidence of the said fact, and the trial court incurred no error \nwhatever by admitting it as such and likewise, in substitution of the original \nof the said entry or record, the certified copy of the same, issued by Father \nSalomon Balani, Exhibit A of the prosecution.<\/p>\n<p>Though the said document constitutes full proof of the facts therein set \nforth, the defense has alleged, nevertheless, that the Leandro de Vera mentioned \nin this document, Exhibit A, is not the same accused referred to in. Exhibit B \nof the prosecution, or, in other words, that he is not the same man who \ncontracted marriage with Guadalupe Samarita in Gasan, Tayabas, on June 21, 1913, \nbecause in the first exhibit reference is made to one Leandro de Vera who on \nthat date was a bachelor, while in the second exhibit, marked B, it is stated \nthat the person who was united in marriage to Guadalupe Samarita was a widower, \nand the defendant, according to his testimony at the trial, contracted his first \nmarriage with one named Ana Lirag, in 1894, in the parish of Binondo, and, after \nher death in 1904, married the aforesaid Guadalupe Samarita, on June 21, 1913, \nin the pueblo of Gasan.<br\/><br\/>In the first place, the defendant himself \ntestified on the witness stand that about the year 1906, that is, two years \nafter he became a widower, according to his statement, through the death of his \nfirst w,ife, Ana Lirag, and while he was in Indan, Ambos Camarines, he separated \nfrom a woman named Romana Sureta, with whom he had been living, on account of \nsome trouble he had with her, and then united conjugally with Modesta Lamadrid, \nwhom he intended to marry, so much so that he even solicited from the bishop of \nNueva Caceres a dispensation of the marriage bans, which was delivered to the \nsaid Modesta, and that they thereupon decided to get married the following year; \nbut that witness, having found that Modesta was unfaithful to him, separated \nfrom her and, leaving Indan, went to Gasan, where he married Guadalupe Samarita. \nSo that, by the defendant's own statements, it appears that he was in Indan, \nAmbos Camarines, after the death as related by him of his first wife, Ana Lirag, \nand that while he was in the said pueblo he united conjugally with Modesta \nLamadrid, although he said that he did not contract marriage with her.<\/p>\n<p>In the second place, Father Salomon Balani, the parish priest of Indan, \npointed out the defendant at the trial as being the same Leandro de Vera whom he \nhad known since they had been in Talisay, in the above-mentioned province, in \n1902 or 1903, and stated that he knew that this man was married and that he was \nalso personally acquainted with His wife, Modesta Lamadrid, and that the last \ntime that witness had seen her was when he was about to leave Indan, on January \n30 of the present year, to appear and testify in this case, on which occasion \nthis same Modesta Lamadrid was in his convent with the sheriff who there \nsubpoenaed her and to whom she then said that she was willing to appear in \ncourt, but that she lacked the means wherewith to defray the cost of the \ntrip.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, both from the certificate issued by the justice of the peace of the \nmunicipality of Gasan, Tayabas, on June21, 1913, Exhibit B of the prosecution, \nrelative to the marriage contracted before him on the same date by Leandro de \nVera with Guadalupe Samarita, and from the certified copy, Exhibit A of the \nprosecution, issued by the parish priest Father Salomon Balani on December 23, \n1913, concerning the marriage contracted by Leandro de Vera with Modesta \nLamadrid in the church of the pueblo of Indan, Ambos Camarines, on June 7, 1907, \nit appears that the parents of the said Leandro de Vera are Gaspar de Vera and \nLorenza Aguilar. So that it has been clearly proved that the same man who in \nJune, 1907, was married to Modesta Lamadrid, in Indan, Ambos Camarines, was the \none who afterwards, in June, 1913, contracted marriage with Guadalupe Samarita, \nin Gasan, Tayabas, and that this man was no other than the defendant in this \ncase, Leandro de Vera. Moreover, it was disclosed by means of these two \ndocuments that the defendant, if it was true that, in 1904, he had become a \nwidower by the death of Ana Lirag, pretended to be a bachelor at the time of his \nmarriage with Modesta Lamadrid in 1907 and afterwards pretended to be a widower, \nwhile the said Modesta Lamadrid was still living, on his marrying Guadalupe \nSamarita in 1913, which statements, as we have seen, were\" made by him for the \npurpose of alleging at the trial that he was not the same Leandro de Vera who \nhad married Modesta Lamadrid, because he was a widower through the death of his \nfirst wife, Ana Lirag, when he married Guadalupe Samarita.<\/p>\n<p>Consequently, the trial court has incurred no error by holding it to have \nbeen proved that on January 7, 1907, the defendant, Leandro de Vera, was united \nin marriage to Modesta Lamadrid, and that, while lawfully married to her and \nwithout this marriage having been legally dissolved, he contracted a new \nmarriage with Guadalupe Samarita on June 21, 1913.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant being guilty of the crime of illegal marriage, provided for and \npunished by article 471 of the Penal Code, with no modifying circumstance to \nconsider in the commission of the said crime, the penalty imposed upon him by \nthe lower court, such as it is in the medium degree, with the accessories of the \nlaw that are mentioned in the judgment appealed from, is proper.<\/p>\n<p>We therefore affirm the said judgment, with the costs against the \nappellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

When his daughter did so, her father caught her by the hand and the \nneck, stretched her out on the floor, raised her skirt, and climbed upon her for \nthe purpose of lying with her. As the daughter offered resistence to the \naccomplishment of her father's criminal purpose, he choked her and threatened to \nkill her with a bolo which he had beside him and which he placed against her \nthroat. Taking advantage of the fear that possessed his daughter in this \nsituation, the accused succeeded in consummating his horrifying and loathsome \ndesign. While he was doing so, Marcos Viloria was awakened by the cries his \nassaulted sister was uttering and started to get up, but desisted from doing so \nand remained quiet in his bed because of the threat his father addressed to him. \nBut when the injured girl had got up after the rape, in order to go to the \nporch, or azotea, of the house, Marcos also arose and joined his sister, who, \nafter changing her clothes, left the house and at daybreak went to the town hall \nto denounce the crime of which she had been the victim.<\/p>\n<p>It likewise appears to be proven that one night some days preceding the date \nof the occurrence the accused Viloria said to his daughter Monica that since her \nchildhood he had made many sacrifices and had toiled for her, that therefore she \nought to give him what he needed, and at that time demanded that she accede to \nhis carnal desires, but the girl rejected his proposal and fled, returning later \nto her father's house early the next morning.<\/p>\n<p>The fact set forth undoubtedly constitutes the crime of rape, penalized in \narticle 438, No. 1, of the. Penal Code, since the accused succeeded in lying \nwith his daughter, Monica Viloria, by employing force, violence, and \nintimidation, whereunder the poor girl succumbed, dishonored by her own \nfather.<\/p>\n<p>The accused denied the charge and pleaded not guilty, alleging in his own \nfavor on the witness stand that upon being awakened in the night or early \nmorning of the occurrence by the sound of footsteps inside his house, he struck \na match and saw a man jumping out of his house through the window; wherefore he \npursued him with a weapon but did not overtake him; and upon returning to his \nhouse inquired of his daughter Monica who that individual was, and as she \nrefused to reply he chastised her. This allegation appears to be absolutely \nunproven, for the Viloria boy, another child of the accused, denied the fact of \nthe chastisement that is said to have been inflicted by his father upon the \nperson of his sister Monica.<\/p>\n<p>The case reveals no reasonable motive to induce the belief that Monica \nViloria may have denounced her father as the perpetrator of a very serious crime \ncommitted upon her person, through mere caprice or the desire for revenge; just \nas it is also incredible that the boy Marcos Viloria would have confirmed his \nsister's denunciation and declaration from the same motive, because it cannot be \ndenied that he did so, impelled by the enormity of the crime, for the sole \npurpose of stating the truth, without being swayed by any passion against his \nfather, nor for the purpose of injuring him. The trial court, who heard the \nwitnesses testify and was convinced of the truth and certainty of the crime, as \nwell as the sincerity with which both the injured girl and her brother \ntestified, for they exhibited sincere grief over the deed done by their own \nfather, was fully convinced that there was no room for the least doubt that the \naccused committed the crime under consideration, in the commission whereof \ncircumstances Nos. 1 and 10 of article 10 of the Penal Code must be held to have \nconcurred, for the injured girl is the daughter of the offender, who, as her \nfather, abused in an infamous and brutal manner the confidence which it is \nnatural his daughter should have reposed in him. But it is improper to hold the \nconcurrence of the circumstance of nocturnity, because the night was not \npurposely selected for commission of the crime with impunity; and also of any \nextenuating circumstance. <\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the only error assigned to the judgment \nappealed from stands refuted, the same should be affirmed: Provided, however, \nthat the accused be sentenced to the penalty of twenty years' imprisonment, with \nthe other penalties set forth in said judgment, and to the costs of this \ninstance.

In that court a demurrer to the \ninformation was sustained on the ground that the action was brought in the name \nof the city of Manila, and not in the name of the United States as required by \nthe provisions of section 2 of General Orders, No. 58. This is an appeal on \nbehalf of the Government from the order sustaining the demurrer.\n<p>The only question before us is whether prosecutions charging violations of \nthe municipal ordinances of the city of Manila, for which punishment by fine or \nimprisonment is prescribed, may be brought in the name of the city of Manila. \nThis question must be answered in the negative. Section 2 of General Orders, No, \n58, provides that in this jurisdiction \"all Prosecutions for public offenses \nshall be in the name of the United States against the persons charged with the \noffenses.\" Violations of municipal ordinances for which punishment by fine or \nimprisonment is lawfully prescribed are, in our opinion, public offenses as that \nterm is used in the above-cited section of the order, and prosecutions for such \nviolations of municipal ordinances must therefore be instituted in the name of \nthe United States. (Santa Barbara <em>vs.<\/em> Sherman, 61 CaL, 57; City of \nBrownville <em>vs.<\/em> Cook, 4 Neb., 101.)<\/p>\n<p>The American cases on this point are digested in American Digest, volume 36, \nMunicipal Corporations, section 1401, and in American Digest, decennial edition, \nvolume 14, Municipal Corporations, section 636. A review of the cases there \ncited discloses that the courts in a number of the States have held that \nconstitutional provisions requiring all prosecutions to be in the name of the \nState do not preclude the legislature from authorizing a municipality to \nmaintain actions in its own name for violations of its ordinances. The reasoning \non which these decisions rest is indicated in the following extract from Dillon \non Municipal Corporations (5th ed., sec. 746):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The distinction between statute law and municipal by-laws has been pointed \nout, and the subject of concurrent prohibitions of the same act by the general \nlaw and by the local ordinances of a municipality treated in the chapter on \nOrdinances. The distinction is there drawn, and is to be observed, between acts \nnot essentially criminal, relating to municipal police and regulation, and those \nintrinsically criminal, and which are made punishable as public offenses by the \ngeneral laws of the State. The pecuniary penalties which are annexed to \nviolations of the former class the legislature may, we think, authorize the \ncorporation to enforce in its own name, by civil action or by complaint, and \nprovision need not necessarily be made that they shall be prosecuted in the name \nof the people or of the State.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But without discussing whether in any event the distinction thus drawn could \nproperly be made in this jurisdiction, it is sufficient at this time to point \nout that there is no express authority granted the city of Manila in its charter \nto institute criminal actions in its own name, and that in this jurisdiction \nactions instituted to enforce penalties of fine or imprisonment prescribed for \nthe violation of municipal ordinances are purely criminal actions and are in no \nsense civil in their nature.<\/p>\n<p>The order sustaining the demurrer in the court below should be and is hereby \naffirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Under the terms of the agreement defendant \nwas to receive a house and two-twelfths of the parcel of land on which the house \nstands, and the plaintiff ten twelfths of this parcel of land. In the course of \ncertain proceedings had in the Court of First Instance of Laguna touching the \nadministration of the estate of Alvarez, deceased, the extra Judicial partition \nagreement was submitted to the court, and approved by an order regularly entered \nin the record of those proceedings.\n<p>Thereafter counsel for the plaintiff secured an order from the court \ndirecting the sheriff to deliver possession of the real estate to which \nplaintiff was entitled by virtue of the extrajudicial partition agreement as \napproved by the court. The sheriff thereupon went to the land in question, \nmeasured off a portion which he estimated to be ten-twelfths of the entire \nparcel, and undertook to make delivery thereof to the plaintiff. Defendant \nnevertheless continued in possession of the house and the entire parcel of land, \nand this action was instituted by the plaintiff to recover the portion measured \noff by the sheriff, and said to be ten-twelfths of the whole.<br\/><br\/>The \ndefendant, claiming that the alleged assignment and delivery of a part of the \nland by the sheriff was wholly without lawful authority, made some attempt to \nhave the proceedings in that regard annulled and to have the court proceed to \nthe partition of the real estate in conformity with the provisions of the Code \nof Civil Procedure. It is not quite clear from the record what was the final \nresult of her efforts in this regard, but it would appear that the court \ndeclined to grant the relief prayed for, on the ground that her application was \nnot made in due form or in the proper action.<br\/><br\/>Defendant now insists that \nall the proceedings of the sheriff in the premises were unauthorized, null and \nvoid, and that while she recognizes plaintiff's right to a ten-twelfths \nundivided share of the land in question he cannot maintain an action to recover \nexclusive possession of the whole or any part of the land held in common by the \nplaintiff and the defendant.<br\/><br\/>We are of opinion that defendant's \ncontentions must be sustained and the judgment of the trial court in favor of \nthe plaintiff should be reversed. Without stopping to examine the legality or \nthe true force and effect of the order to the sheriff to deliver to the \nplaintiff the ten-twelfths undivided share of the land in question to which he \nwas entitled under the terms of the order approving the extra-judicial \nagreement, it is very clear that until and unless a partition of the land had \nbeen made either by agreement of the parties or in a proper judicial proceeding \nthe sheriff could not give physical possession of such an undivided interest \nwithout giving possession of the entire tract, which of course he had no \nauthority to do under the terms of the order. So also it is manifest that the \nsheriff was wholly without authority to select arbitrarily a portion of the \nland, which he estimated to be ten-twelfths of the whole, and thus deprive the \nowner of the two-twelfths share of his right to an undivided interest \ntherein.<\/p>\n<p>The remedy of a tenant in common of an estate in land, (the holder of an \nundivided interest therein) who desires to have sole and exclusive possession of \nhis interest is the appropriate proceeding for partition; and ordinarily no \naction can be maintained between cotenants for the exclusive possession of the \ncommon property, or for the sole enjoyment of the profits thereof. (Civil Code, \nBook 1, Title III; 38 Cyc, 19, and cases there cited.)<\/p>\n<p>The trial court seems to have rested its judgment in favor of the plaintiff, \nin part at least, on the alleged consent of the defendant; but we think it is \nvery clear that defendant did not consent to the action taken by the sheriff, \nand her consent to the order approving the extrajudicial agreement wherein she \nrecognized the right of plaintiff to a ten-twelfths undivided interest in the \nland could under no circumstances be construed as consent to the arbitrary \npartition of the land by the sheriff, even though the order to the sheriff had \nexpressly authorized such action on his part.<\/p>\n<p>Let judgment be entered reversing the judgment entered in the court below, \nwithout costs to either party.<br\/><br\/><em>Arellano, C.

He testified that the \nmurder was planned by the appellant Lorenzo Orozco, with whose wife the deceased \nhad been maintaining illicit relations, and that he himself as well as the other \nappellants had joined the party which committed the crime at the urgent \ninvitation of Orozco, who gave the various members of the party small sums of \nmoney as an expression of his appreciation of their assistance (gratificacion). \nHis account of the infliction of the wounds upon the deceased and of the burial \nand concealment of the corpse, as given on the witness stand and as given by him \nwhen he first confessed his guilty participation in the commission of the crime \nwhile under arrest, was fully corroborated by the law and medical officers who \nfound the body of the deceased buried at the place and in the manner indicated \nby him in his extrajudicial confession. His account of the guilty participation \nin the crime of the appellants Lorenzo Orozco and Doroteo de los Santos was \nsubstantially corroborated by one Lucio Espiritu, the patron of a launch, who \nswore that he overheard these two discussing the crime on board his boat, and \nthat when he asked Orozco why he had killed the deceased, Orozco replied \"that \nhe was his wife's paramour.\"<\/p>\n<p>On this appeal counsel for the defense rely for the most part on their \ncontention that the evidence of Pedro Flores, the principal witness for the \nprosecution, is not worthy of credence, he being a self-confessed accomplice in \nthe commission of the crime, and it appearing further that his testimony at the \ntrial was not in entire conformity with his written and signed extrajudicial \nconfession and his testimony at the preliminary investigation.<\/p>\n<p>As to counsel's contentions that the testimony of Pedro Flores should be \nrejected solely on the ground that this witness was a self-confessed accomplice, \nit is sufficient to say that we have frequently decided that the testimony of \naccomplices, even when uncorroborated, is competent and admissible; and that \nwhile it should always be received with caution and scrutinized with the utmost \ncare, coming as it does from a polluted source, nevertheless if under all the \ncircumstances of the case it is so clear, satisfactory, and convincing as to \nleave no doubt in the mind of the court as to its truth, a conviction may \nproperly be based upon it. (U.S. <em>vs.<\/em> Ocampo, 4 Phil. Rep., 400; U. S. \n<em>vs.<\/em> Grandoso, 16 Phil. Rep., 419; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Bernales, 18 Phil. \nRep., 525; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Soriano, 25 Phil. Rep., 624.)<\/p>\n<p>After a careful review of all the evidence of record we find nothing which \nwould justify us in disturbing the findings of the trial judge as to the \ncredibility of this witness.<\/p>\n<p>In the first place, as we have so frequently pointed out, the trial judge who \nsees and hears the witnesses testify has exceptional opportunities to form a \ncorrect conclusion as to the degree of credit which should be accorded them, and \nwhere, as in this case, he has manifestly exercised due care and discretion in \nmaking his findings and has not over looked anything which would justify us in \nquestioning the soundness of his conclusions, this court will rarely be \njustified in disturbing his findings and conclusions in this regard;<\/p>\n<p>In the second place, the alleged inconsistencies and contradictions in the \ntestimony of this witness at the trial and in the course of his preliminary \nexamination, are not such, in our opinion, as to put in doubt the truth of his \nstatements on the witness stand. It appears that in his extrajudicial confession \nand during the preliminary investigation he did not mention the names of Manuel \nand Meliton Flores as members of the party implicated in the murder, but that at \nthe trial in the court below he included their names together with those \nmentioned by him in the course of the preliminary proceedings. His explanation \nwas that these men were his brothers and that he withheld the fact that they had \nanything to do with the commission of the crime because he wanted if possible to \nshield them from the consequences of their guilty association with the other \ndefendants. We do not think that his conduct in this regard was such as to raise \nany real doubt as to the truth of his testimony upon the witness stand, where he \nevidently felt obligated to speak the whole truth, without any attempt at \nconcealment and without any hope of being able to save his brothers from the \nlegal consequences of their complicity in the crime. As to the other alleged \ninconsistency and contradictions in his statements made at and before the trial, \nit is sufficient to say that we are satisfied that they are more apparent than \nreal, and that in any event they are wholly insufficient to raise any real doubt \nthat when testifying at the trial in the court below he was testifying to the \ntruth as he then recalled it.<\/p>\n<p>In the third place, the very form and manner in which the testimony of the \ninformer is spread on the record are strongly persuasive of its truth, and a \nreading of the whole story of the commission of the crime as told by this \nwitness leaves no room for doubt as to its substantial accuracy. Indeed, we are \nconvinced that this witness could not have successfully withstood the \nexamination to which he was subjected without betraying himself to the trial \njudge, had he been consciously engaged in an attempt to tell anything but the \ntruth and the whole truth as he understood it.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, his testimony was fully corroborated by the unquestioned and \nunquestionable testimony of a number of competent witnesses as to the manner in \nwhich the fatal wounds were inflicted, as to the place and manner of the burial \nof the deceased after the commission of the crime, and as to the motive which \ninspired its instigator; and as to the participation of Lorenzo Orozco and \nDoroteo de los Santos.<\/p>\n<p>We conclude that the judgment of conviction entered in the court below is \nfully sustained by the competent evidence in the record and that there can be no \nreasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellants of the commission of the \ncrime of which they were convicted, marked with various aggravating \ncircumstances as set forth in the opinion of the trial judge.<\/p>\n<p>We are of opinion however that in imposing the penalty upon the four \ndefendants and appellants convicted as principals in the commission of the crime \nthese aggravating circumstances should have been compensated by the extenuating \ncircumstances set forth in subsection 7 of article 9 of the Penal Code and in \narticle 11 as amended by Act No. 2142. A review of the whole record convinces us \nthat all these defendants are men of a low order of intelligence, with but \nlittle \"instruction or education.\" It also affirmatively appears that the \ninstigator of the crime had been aroused to a high degree of passion and \n\"obfuscation\" by the discovery of the fact that the( deceased was carrying on \nillicit relations with his wife and had recently come into the community for the \nexpress purpose of continuing those illicit relations; while his accomplices, \nwho appear to have been ignorant friends, neighbors and dependents, were also \naroused by him to a high pitch of anger against the betrayer of the family of \ntheir friend.<\/p>\n<p>We have hesitated considerably in giving these convicts the benefit of any \ndoubt there might be as to their right to have these extenuating circumstances \ntaken into consideration in fixing the penalty, in view of the fact that it \nappears that they received some small sums of money from the instigator of the \ncrime immediately after it was committed. Upon a review of the whole record of \nthe case, however, we are inclined to think that this money was not offered or \npaid as a recompense for their participation in the crime, and that it was not \nthe moving factor which induced them to aid the offended husband in obtaining \nhis revenge. It seems rather to have been given voluntarily by Orozco after the \ncrime had been committed as a sort of expression of his appreciation of their \nsympathy and aid (gratificacion). <\/p>\n<p>The sentence imposed by the trial judge, modified by substituting for so much \nthereof as imposes the death penalty upon the defendants and appellants Lorenzo \nOrozco, Irineo de la Cruz, Manuel Flores and Doroteo de los Santos, the penalty \nof <em>cadena perpetua,<\/em> together with the subsidiary penalties prescribed \nby law, should be and is affirmed, with the costs of this instances against the \nappellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

It \nis stated therein that Cayat could not sign his own name, while it was \nsatisfactorily proven at the trial that he could. It is admitted by the \nplaintiff that a transaction occurred between Cacayan and Cayat with regard to \nthe land in question, but she insists that it was not one of purchase and sale \nbut one of pledge or mortgage for a loan of P100. Two witnesses testified that \nthis was the character of the transaction as stated to them by Cacayan about the \ntime it occurred.<\/p>\n<p>If there was any fraud in the execution of this notarial document, it \nconsisted in someone impersonating the deceased Cayat as vendor. Under section \n23 of the Notarial Law of Spain, extended to these islands by the royal decree \nof February 15, 1889, the notary was obliged to satisfy himself of the identity \nof the persons to the instrument. The presumption is that the notary who \nexecuted this document complied with the Notarial Law in this respect. The mere \nfact that the vendor told the notary that he could not sign his own name is not \nsufficient to prove fraud in the execution of the instrument. Article 64 of the \nProvisional Regulations for the' organization and management of notarial offices \nin the Philippine Islands, provides that the notary shall state this fact in his \ncertificate, which was done in the present case. The testimony as to the offer \nof P100 to the defendant in the presence of the provincial governor is \nunsatisfactory. Mr. Wagner, who was, at the time, private secretary of the \ngovernor, was called as a witness, but his testimony is so vague because of his \nindistinct recollection of the incident, that it is of no practical value. We do \nnot consider the testimony of the plaintiff and her other witnesses sufficient \nto establish the fact that defendant was actually tendered the P100 in repayment \nof a loan, and that he asked for time to consider the proposition. It is quite \npossible that the governor sought to repurchase the land in order to gratify the \ndesire of the plaintiff to regain possession of it. In view of the importance of \nthe office of notary under the Spanish regime and the consequent solemnity and \nstrong presumption of accuracy of documents certified by him, we are not \ninclined to adopt the theory of fraud in the very act of <em>execution<\/em> of \nsuch documents unless it is the only possible construction which can be placed \nupon the evidence of record. That this document was fraudulently executed is an \naffirmative allegation of the plaintiff which should be proved by a \npreponderance of the evidence. We do not believe that this has been done. As the \ndocument of purchase and sale must be held authentic, there is no basis for \nplaintiff's action.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the lower court is therefore reversed and the defendant \nabsolved from the complaint, without costs in either instance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The minimum \npenalty prescribed by law for this offense (a fine of P300) was imposed, and the \nonly contention of counsel on this appeal is that this penalty is excessive.\n<p>Whether or not the penalties prescribed by law upon conviction of violations \nof particular statutes are too severe or are not severe enough are questions as \nto which commentators on the law may fairly differ; but it is the duty of the \ncourts to enforce the will of the legislator in all cases unless it clearly \nappears that a given penalty falls within the prohibited class of excessive \nfines or cruel and unusual punishments. Manifestly a fine of P300 prescribed for \nthe violation of the provisions of the Opium Law does not fall within the \nprohibited class of penalties.<\/p>\n<p>The question is not whether, in the opinion of the court, the minimum fine \nprescribed by law is in excess of that which the court might consider expedient \nor advisable were it called upon to prescribe such penalty. The exercise of \ndiscretion in this regard is conferred not upon the court but upon the \nlegislator. Hence the courts will be justified in declaring a fine prescribed by \nstatute to be excessive, only in those cases where it is so clearly so, \nconsidering the nature of the violation of the law for which it is prescribed, \nthat all right-minded men will agree that it exceeds the utmost limit of \npunishment which the vindication of the law demands.<\/p>\n<p>In a former case we discussed at length the nature and the gravity of the \ninjury to the body politic which it is asserted would result from the unchecked \nspread of the opium habit, and we then expressed our belief that the legislator \nwas clearly within his prerogative in enacting the statute defining and \npenalizing the unauthorized use of the drug and its derivatives. (U. S. \n<em>vs.<\/em> Lim Sing, 23 Phil. Rep.,424.) Adhering to the doctrine and the \nreasoning of that opinion we have no hesitation in holding that in prescribing a \nminimum penalty of P300 for the violations of the penal provisions of that \nstatute, the legislator did not exceed the limits of the discretion conferred \nupon him in that regard, and that this penalty is not therefore excessive in the \nsense in which that word is used in the Philippine Bill of Rights.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the lower court convicting and sentencing the defendant and \nappellant should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance \nagainst him.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

I object, however, to the \nreference made to United States vs. Lim Sing (23 Phil. Rep., 424). That case, in \nso far as it sought to limit the trial court in the use of its discretion in the \nimposition of penalties under the Opium Law, has been repeatedly overruled by \nthe practice of this court. While it has been followed in some instances, it has \nbeen disregarded in more. It has been and is utterly discredited as an \nauthority. A case which has been disregarded and rejected as often, if not \noftener than it has been followed, I do not consider an authority relative to \nthe doctrine as to which it has been disregarded.<\/p>\n<p>If the reference to the case were confined to some of the general principles \ntherein referred to, I would have no objection ; but an attempt to reaffirm a \ndoctrine, already thoroughly discredited, which takes away from Courts of First \nInstance the discretion which the legislature expressly gave them, which \ndeprives them of the power to represent their districts judicially, which \nprohibits them from administering the law according to the needs of their \nprovinces and thereby makes their knowledge of those provinces and of the \nhistory and status of crime therein utterly valueless, which takes from them the \nright of informing themselves relative to the criminal before them, his mental \nand physical condition, his antecedents and history, and make proper use of such \ninformation, which prevents them from considering the personal needs of the \ncriminal with the object of uniting curative and punitive treatment, which \ndenies them the right to use the faculty of observation at trials and of making \ndeductions therefrom, which puts discretion in bonds and judgment in stocks, \nwhich makes trial courts not trial courts but referees to take testimony for \nsubmission to the Supreme Court, which makes them automatons moving and acting \nby the substituted judgment of the Supreme Court, which, while it does not \nrelieve them of the grave responsibility of properly administering the law in \ntheir districts placed upon them by the legislature, robs them of the ability to \nmeet and discharge that responsibility adequately, which repeals the law \nestablishing discretional penalties and substitutes in its place a court-made \nlaw instituting the system of fixed penalties, which overrules the doctrine \nuniversally accepted that an appellate court will not interfere with a trial \ncourt acting in the exercise of its discretion unless a clear abuse thereof is \naffirmatively shown and that the judgment of a trial court imposing a criminal \npenalty which is within his discretion is not subject to review by an appellate \ncourt, which lays down the proposition that a court which is expressly \nauthorized by statute to impose,<em> in its discretion,<\/em> a fine of from P300 \nto P10,000, commits a reversible error when it imposes P400; an attempt to \nreaffirm a doctrine doing or tending to do these things meets my instant \nopposition.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

A confraternity is a kind of \nassociation of devotees formed for the purpose of carrying on with greater \nsolemnity and pomp the adoration of the Virgin Mother of the Savior, as \nauthorized by the rites of the Catholic Church, and therefore as such legally \nestablished association, it is a juridical entity with rights and obligations \nand can' validly acquire real property, as shown by said certificates of \npossessory annotations.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, it is beyond dispute that the said lands, donated to the \nconfraternity of the Virgin in the said town of San Jose, are property dedicated \nto the Catholic religion and the operation of said confraternity was suspended \nby <em>force majeure<\/em> in consequence of the revolution and of the profound \nand general upheaval nearly all the towns in these Islands suffered. It is to be \nnoted that the lands in question, which have always been administered by the \nparish priests of that town and, in spite of their temporary absence from the \nparish of San Jose, have not ceased to belong to the faith nor have they lost \nthe character they had from the instant when they passed into possession of the \nchurch in charge of the persons who directed and administered the Catholic \nworship in the parish of that town.<\/p>\n<p>The lands in question were apparently abandoned for the space of some years \nduring the revolution, but the church did not thereby lose its right of \npossession and administration thereof, as intended and devoted to maintaining \nthe faith, especially when it does not appear of record that they were duly \nalienated according to law.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of the Roman Catholic Church <em>vs.<\/em> Santos (7 Phil. Rep., \n66), after affirming that the ruling in the case of Barlin <em>vs.<\/em> Ramirez \n(7 Phil. Rep., 41) is applicable thereto, it is stated that to the authorities \ncited in that case may be added the following statement by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States in the case of the Mormon Church <em>vs.<\/em> The United \nStates (136 U, S., 53):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"By the Spanish law, whatever was given to the service of God became \nincapable of private ownership, being held by the clergy as guardians or \ntrustees; and any part not required for their own support, and the repairs, \nbooks, and furniture of the church, was devoted to works of piety, such as \nfeeding and clothing the poor, supporting orphans, marrying poor virgins, \nredeeming captives, and the like. When property was given for a particular \nobject, as a church, a hospital, a convent or a community, etc., and the object \nfailed, the property did not revert to the donor, or his heirs, but devolved to \nthe Crown, the church, or other convent or community, unless the donation \ncontained an express condition in writing to the contrary. <\/p>\n<p>\"It follows that the Roman Catholic Church is entitled to the exclusive \npossession and occupancy of the property mentioned in the \ncomplaint.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Three laws are cited in the foregoing quotation from Title 28 of the Third \n<em>Partida<\/em>, of which Law 12 is here quoted as' the most pertinent, reading \nthus:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"No sacred, religious, or holy thing, devoted to the service of God, can be \nthe subject of ownership by any man, nor can it be considered as included in his \nproperty holdings. Although the priests may have such things in their \npossession, yet they are not the owners thereof. They hold them thus as \nguardians or servants, or because they have the care of the same and serve God \nin or with them. Hence they were allowed to take from the revenues of the church \nand lands what was reasonably necessary for their support; the balance, \nbelonging to God, was to be devoted to pious purposes, such as the feeding and \nclothing of the poor, the support of orphans, the marrying of poor virgins to \nprevent their becoming evil women because of their poverty; and for the \nredemption of captives and the repairing of the churches, and the buying of \nchalices, clothing, books, and other things which they might be in need of, and \nother similar charitable purposes.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It is a fact proven in the record that the lands in litigation, as property \ndevoted to the faith by their original owners, were placed at the disposition \nand under the administration of the parish priest of San Jose, as the \nrepresentative of the Roman Catholic Church in the town of San Jose and \nadministrator of the parish church thereof, and it is also proven in the case \nthat the representative of the church in said town has continued to possess and \nadminister the said lands for many years, applying the products thereof to \nsupporting the Catholic worship in that town; and yet in spite of all this the \nmunicipality of San Jose, in view of the upheavals the revolution brought about \nafter the year 1896 and of the fact that the parish priest of said town was \nabsent, took possession of the lands in question without the consent of the \nchurch's representatives and without right or title that would legalize and \njustify its possession, which is nothing more than a mere detainer or \nusurpation; and therefore no legal reason or ground exists whereby it ought to \nbe maintained therein, for it has not exhibited or presented any title to \ndemonstrate a better right than that pertaining to the representative of the \nchurch, which in strict justice must be restored to possession of the said \nlands, either as the lawful owner thereof or at least as possessor with perfect \nright to continue to use the said fields, so that the products thereof may be \nemployed.in supporting the worship for which they were intended.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment \nappealed from are deemed refuted, and finding that it is correct according to \nthe law and the merits of the case, affirmation thereof is proper, as we do \naffirm it, with the costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The plaintiffs allege that the defendant illegally and forcibly \ntook possession of said parcel of land in the month of October, 1904, and that \nby reason of said illegal possession on the part of the defendant, they have \nsuffered damages in the amount of P350.\n<p>After hearing the evidence, the honorable Richard Campbell, judge, found that \nthe defendant had illegally dispossessed the plaintiffs of their possession of \nthe property in question and rendered a judgment, adjudging the possession of \nthe land in question to the plaintiffs, with costs against the defendant. The \nlower court made no finding whatever concerning the damages prayed for by the \nplaintiffs. From that judgment the defendant appealed to this court and made the \nfollowing assignments of error:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I. The lower court erred in setting aside its judgment of August 4, 1911, \nand ordering that the case be reopened.<\/p>\n<p>\"II. The lower court erred in rendering judgment in favor of the plaintiffs \nand against the defendant, by adjudicating the possession of the land to the \nformer on the ground that the instrument of gift executed <em>propter \nnuptias<\/em> on June 18, 1876, by Hermenegildo Laciapag in favor of Vicente \nLaciapag, was valid.<\/p>\n<p>\"III. The lower court erred in holding that the gift made by Hermenegildo \nLaciapag to the defendant Mariano Laciapag in a public document was null and \nvoid.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From an examination of the record, the following facts seem to be proven, \nbeyond question:<\/p>\n<p>First. That for a long time prior to the 18th day of June, 1876, the land in \nquestion had belonged to Hermenegildo Laciapag and his wife.<\/p>\n<p>Second. That during the marriage of the said Hermenegildo Laciapag with his \nwife, they had three children, to wit, Mariano Laciapag, Froilan Laciapag, and \nVicente Laciapag.<\/p>\n<p>Third. That upon the marriage of each of the said children, Hermenegildo \nLaciapag and his wife, by a \"donation propter nuptias,\u201d gave to each of them a \ncertain parcel of land; that Vicente was married on the 18th day of June, 1876, \nto Vicenta Madarang; that during the marriage of Vicente Laciapag and Vicenta \nMadarang there was born to them one child, the said plaintiff, Juana Laciapag; \nthat Vicente Laciapag and his wife entered upon the possession of the land in \nquestion and occupied the same up to 1898 or 1899, when Vicente Laciapag died, \nleaving his wife and his daughter, the said Juana Laciapag, surviving him; that \nafter the death of Vicente Laciapag, his wife, desiring to return to her \nparents, turned the possession of the land in question over to her \nfather-in-law, Hermenegildo Laciapag and her child, Juana; that later Juana \nLaciapag was married to the plaintiff Modesto Surio; that upon the marriage of \nJuana Laciapag and Modesto Surio, her grandfather, Hermenegildo Laciapag, \ndelivered the land to her and to her husjband; that upon the 22d day of July, \n1904, the said Juana Laciapag and her husband, Modesto Surio, together with \nVicenta Madarang, sold the land in question to the plaintiff, Pedro Vergara, by \nmeans of a private document and delivered the possession of the said land to the \nvendee; that the vendee, Pedro Vergara, took possession of the land in the month \nof June, 1904, and continued in the possession thereof until the month of \nOctober of the same year, when the defendant Mariano Laciapag appeared and \ncompelled Pedro Vergara to cede to him one-half of the land in question ; that \nlater, or some time in the year 1907, the defendant, Mariano Laciapag, by force \nand threats took possession of the other one-half of the land and ousted the \nsaid PedroVergara from the possession thereof.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the first assignment of error, it appears from the record \nthat on the 4th day of August, 1911, after having heard the evidence, the lower \ncourt rendered a judgment in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiffs, \nand adjudged the right of possession of the land in question to the defendant, \ntaxing the costs against the plaintiffs. Immediately the plaintiffs made a \nmotion for a rehearing, which was granted by the lower court on the 7th day of \nAugust, 1911. At the close of the rehearing, and on the 19th day of March, 1912, \nthe lower court rendered a new decision in which he decided that the land in \nquestion belonged to the plaintiffs and ordered the defendant to deliver the \npossession of the same to them, with costs against the defendant. The: \ndefendant-appellant, as his first assignment of error, says that the lower court \ncommitted an error in granting the new trial. In reply to that argument, the \nappellees allege that no error was committed and cite the provisions of sections \n145 and 146 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions. Said section 145 provides \nthe circumstances under which a new trial may be granted. Section 146 provides \nthe method of procedure in applications for a new trial. Section 146 provides \nthat the overruling or granting of a motion for a new trial <em>shall not be the \nground of an exception,<\/em> but shall be deemed to have been an act of \ndiscretion on the part of the judge, within the meaning of the second sentence \nof section 141. Said section 146 further provides, however, that if the motion \nfor a new trial was made on the ground that the evidence was \n<em>insufficient<\/em> to justify the decision, an <em>exception <\/em>may be \ntaken to the order overruling such motion, and such exception may be reviewed by \nthe Supreme Court as in-other cases. An examination of the record fails to \ndisclose the fact that the defendant appellant made any exception to the ruling \nof the lower court granting a new trial. We have frequently decided that no \nobjection to the procedure in the lower court will be considered here unless an \nobjection or exception was made or taken in the lower court. The only exception \nto this rule is one where the jurisdiction of the lower court is involved. The \ndefendant-appellant not having laid a foundation for his first assignment of \nerror it can not be considered here. (Andrews <em>vs.<\/em> Morente, 9 Phil. \nRep., 634; Guerrero <em>vs.<\/em> Singson, 19 Phil. Rep., 122.)<\/p>\n<p>We think that the second and third assignments of error may be discussed \ntogether. The appellant attempts by said assignments of error, to show that the \nappellees are not the owners, in fact, of the parcel of land in question. That \nmay be true. The question of ownership, however, was not the question presented \nto the lower court. The only question presented was whether or not the \nplaintiffs were entitled to the possession as against the defendant. The lower \ncourt found from the evidence, that the defendant had by force deprived the \nplaintiffs of the possession of the property. If that is true, then the \nplaintiffs are entitled to be repossessed of the same, even though the defendant \nis, in fact, the owner. <\/p>\n<p>If the defendant had any right or title to the possession of the land in \nquestion, at the time he dispossessed the plaintiffs, or at any other time, it \nwas his duty to commence an action in the courts for the purpose of establishing \nthat right. He had no right, even though he was the real owner of the property \nin question, to forcibly take possession of the land and eject the occupants. \nThe arbitrary use of might exercised by the defendant, under the mere shadow of \nright, cannot be tolerated by the courts. (Tambunting <em>vs.<\/em> City of \nManila, 5 Phil. Rep., 590.) Parties in the peaceable and quiet possession of \nland cannot be ejected, except by judicial proceedings. If the possessor is \nforcibly ejected, he may be replaced in possession of the property in a proper \naction brought for that purpose. (Villar <em>vs.<\/em> City of Manila, 6 Phil \nRep., 655.) A tenant even, who has been unlawfully and forcibly ejected from the \npossession of land by his landlord, without judicial proceedings, is entitled to \nbe repossessed of the property in a proper action brought for that purpose.<\/p>\n<p>The appellant, in the second assignment of error, alleges that the donation \nof Hermenegildo Laciapag and his wife to Vicente Laciapag, on the occasion of \nhis marriage with Vicenta Madarang, on the 18th of June, 1876, was void, for the \nreason that it had not been executed in accordance with the laws in force at \nthat time. (Title 4, Law 9, of the Fifth Partida.) The appellee admits that \nperhaps said donation did not comply with all the requisites of a donation \nrequired by the law at that time. The donor, however, permitted the donee and \nhis wife to enter into possession of the property on the day of their marriage \nand to continue to live there and occupy the same as owners, until the year 1898 \nor 1899, when Vicente Laciapag died, and the possession of the property was \nreturned to the donor, for the reason that Vicente's wife desired to return to \nher parents. In 1904 the possession of the property was returned to Juana \nLaciapag, on the occasion of her marriage to Modesto Surio. The return of the \nproperty by the donor to the surviving successor of Vicente Laciapag (Juana \nLaciapag) would seem to be a clear additional ratification of the original \ndonation. Admitting that the donation of the 18th of June, 1876, had not \ncomplied absolutely with the formal requisites under the law, it would seem, \nfrom the fact that the donor permitted the donee to continue in the possession \nof said parcel of land for a period of twenty-three or twenty-four years, and \nthat he later recognized the rights of the legitimate successor of the donee \n(1904), that he intended and did, in fact, give the title of the land in \nquestion to Vicente Laciapag. It will be remembered that Juana Laciapag and her \nhusband, Modesto Surio, and the wife of Vicente Laciapag, Vicenta Madarang, sold \nthe land in question to the plaintiff, Pedro Vergara and delivered the \npossession to him in the month of June, 1904. It will be remembered also that \nthree years later (1907) the defendant, by force and intimidation, deprived the \nsaid Pedro Vergara of his possession of the property in question. The record \nshows that a period of about thirty-one years elapsed after the original \ndonation to Vicente Laciapag before the defendant attempted to recover, by \nforce, the possession of the land. Even granting that the defendant had a right \nto raise the question of ownership in an action solely for the possession of \nproperty, by one who had been forcibly ejected from the same, we are of the \nopinion that, even upon that theory, considering all of the facts in the record, \nthat the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.<\/p>\n<p>In the third assignment of error the appellant alleges that the lower court \ncommitted an error in deciding that the donation made by Hermenegildo Laciapag \nto the defendant in February, 1907, was void. If the appellant believed that the \nland belonged to him, he should have brought an ordinary action for the purpose \nof settling that question. He had no right to forcibly possess himself of the \nland. If Hermenegildo Laciapag had, in fact, given the land in question \nthirty-one years before to Vicente Laciapag, he certainly had nothing to donate \nto the defendant in 1907, concerning the land in question. We believe that we \nhave answered the contention of the appellant in the argument relating to the \nsecond assignment of error.<\/p>\n<p>After carefully considering the facts presented to the lower court, and the \nlaw applicable thereto, we are of the opinion that no error was committed by the \nlower court. The judgment of the lower court is, therefore, hereby affirmed, \nwith costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

An appeal from the decision \nof the Court of Land Registration ordering the inscription of the land in their \nname was taken by Catalino Broce, and this Supreme Court on March 16, 1911, \naffirmed the judgment (19 Phil. Rep., 599). On April 24, 1911, Damaso Apurado et \nal., the present appellants, under the provisions of section 38 of the Land \nRegistration Act, filed a petition for the opening of the decree of registration \non the ground of fraud in its procurement. This was the first appearance of \nthese parties in opposition to the registration of the land in the names of the \npetitioners.\n<p>Carlos Apurado was the maternal grandfather of Eusebia Broce et al. and the \nascendant of Damaso Apurado et al. It is conceded that Carlos Apurado at one \ntime owned the land in dispute. It is claimed by Eusebia Broce et al. that he \nsold this land to their father, the son-in-law of Carlos Apurado. It is claimed \nby Damaso Apurado et al. that he never sold this land to the father of the \npetitioners, but that he owned it until his death, and that they therefore have \na right to participate in the division of it as heirs by force of law. The fraud \nwhich they rely upon to secure an annulment of the registration in the names of \nthe petitioners is an alleged agreement whereby Damaso Apurado et al. agreed not \nto interfere or take part in the registration of the land on the condition that \nEusebia Broce et al. should attend to the registration of the land in behalf of \nall, securing to each the participation to which he was entitled as a legal heir \nof the deceased Carlos Apurado.<\/p>\n<p>Section 38 of Act No. 496 reads in part as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Every decree of registration shall bind the land, and quiet title thereto, \nsubject only to the exceptions stated in the following section.

Such decree shall not be opened by reason of the absence, infancy, or \nother disability of any person affected thereby, nor by any proceeding in any \ncourt for reversing judgments or decrees; subject, however, to the right of any \nperson deprived of land or of any estate or interest herein by decree of \nregistration obtained by fraud to file in the Court of Land Registration a \npetition for review within one year after entry of the decree, provided no \ninnocent purchaser for value has acquired an interest.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The decision of the Court of Land Registration is dated February 25, 1909. \nThis Supreme Court affirmed that decision on March 16, 1911 (<em>supra<\/em>). An \napplication to set it aside was made on April 24, 1911. Under these \ncircumstances the question arises whether the year within which the decree of \nregistration may be set aside for fraud dates from the decision of the Court of \nLand Registration or from the time the decree may be entered by that court based \nupon the decision of the Supreme Court, when the case is appealed.<\/p>\n<p>Section 4 of Act No. 1108 repeals section 14 of the Land Registration Act and \nprovides that all of chapter 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure, relating to the \nprocedure of the Supreme Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction \nshall extend to appeals from the Court of Land Registration, with the exception \nof appeals in special proceedings (sec. 498), and interest on money judgments \naccrued during the pendency of actions on appeal (sec. 510), the last two being \nclearly inapplicable to judgments of courts of land registration. By the same \nsection (sec. 4 of Act No. 1108), sections 514, 515, and 516, providing for the \nexercise of original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in certiorari, mandamus, \nand prohibition, and section 517, providing for the auxiliary writ of \npreliminary injunction, as applicable to proceedings in the Courts of First \nInstance, are also expressly extended to Courts of Land Registration.<\/p>\n<p>A detailed examination of the various sections of the Code of Civil Procedure \nand the adjudicated cases of this Court, wherein they have been applied, \nestablishes beyond question that judgments of the Court of Land Registration \nmust receive the same treatment on appeal as do judgments of the Court of First \nInstance, with the limitations necessarily imposed by the special character and \nattributes of the Court of Land Registration. Referring more particularly to the \nfinality of judgments of the Court of Land Registration: This Supreme Court has, \non various occasions declared that judgments of the Court of First Instance \nbecome final for most purposes only when the prevailing party may have execution \nthereon as of right; that is, after the time within which an appeal therefrom \nmay be taken. And in a recent case, De Fiesta <em>vs.<\/em> Llorente and Manila \nRailroad Co. (25 Phil. Rep., 554), the same doctrine was applied to judgments \ncoming from the Court of Land Registration, as appears throughout the opinion in \nthat case, and more particularly from the following quotation:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The use of the phrase 'as of right' in this connection does not mean merely \nthe time when, under the circumstances of the case, he has a right to have \nexecution; for it is to be presumed that when execution is issued by special \norder of the court he had a right to have it issued. It means, rather, that he \nhas such a right to have execution issue, that he will not be liable to restore \nin the event of a reversal on appeal; and this right can only exist when the \njudgment, so far as it appears from the face of the record, is final as a result \nof the lapse of the time allowed for appeal.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not apply to judgments of the \nCourt of Land Registration. Therefore, an appeal from a judgment of that court \nof itself and <em>ipso facto<\/em> stays the execution of the judgment, i. e., \nthe issuance of a title of registration to the petitioner.<\/p>\n<p>There are, furthermore, certain specific provisions of Act No. 496 which \ndefinitely provide that the certificate of registration which, of course, \nconcludes the whole matter and is the \"execution\" of the judgment of \nregistration, shall not be issued until the time for appeal has elapsed.<\/p>\n<p>Section 4 of Act No. 1108 provides: \"That no certificates of title shall be \nissued * * * until after the expiration of the period for perfecting a bill of \nexceptions for filing.\"<\/p>\n<p>Section 15 of Act No. 496 provides: \"At the end of the proceedings on appeal, \nthe clerk of the appellate court in which final decision was made shall certify \nto the Court of Land Registration the final decision on the appeal, and the \nCourt of Land Registration shall enter the final decree in the case, in \naccordance with the certificate of the clerk of the appellate court in which \nfinal decision was made.\"<br\/><br\/>This furnishes a most convincing argument that \nan appeal stays the issuance of a certificate of title, which is the sole \nsubject of the action. The quoted proviso of section 4 of Act No. 1108 and \nsection 14 of the original Act, which we have just quoted, taken together, show \nexactly when the judgment of registration becomes final: when no appeal is \ntaken, it becomes final on the expiration of the time allowed for filing an \nappeal; and when an appeal has been taken, the judgment of registration becomes \nfinal when it is affirmed by a final judgment of this Supreme Court.<\/p>\n<p>Reverting now to the quoted portion of section 38, it will be noted that the \nyear within which a decree of registration may be attacked on the ground of \nfraud dates from the <em>entry of the decree.<\/em> The decree cannot be entered \nuntil the judgment becomes final, and an appeal from the decision of the Court \nof Land Registration prevents the judgment from becoming final until that decree \nis affirmed by the judgment of this court. In such a case, only when the final \njudgment of this court is returned to the Court of Land Registration, under the \nprocedure established by section 14, may the decree of registration be entered. \nTherefore, it is clear that the year within which such a decree may be attacked \ndates from the entry of the decree based upon the judgment of the Supreme Court. \nIn the present case, this court filed its decision on March 16, 1911. The \njudgment was entered by the clerk of this court on April 6. As the petition of \nApurado et al. asking for a review of the same was presented less than twenty \ndays thereafter, it is clear that they are well within the year allowed for the \nfiling of such a petition.<\/p>\n<p>In order to obtain the benefits of section 38 the applicant (1) must have an \nestate or interest in the land, and (2) must show fraud in the procurement of \nthe decree of registration. A mere claim of ownership is not sufficient to avoid \na certificate or title obtained under the Land Registration Act. An important \nfeature of a certificate of title is its finality. The proceedings whereby such \na title is obtained are directed against all persons, known or unknown, whether \nactually served with notice or not, and includes all who have an interest in the \nland. If they do not appear and oppose the registration of their own estate or \ninterest in the property in the name of another, judgment is rendered against \nthem by default, and, in the absence of fraud such judgment is conclusive. If an \ninterest in the land will not by itself operate to vacate a decree of \nregistration, a <em>fortiori,<\/em> fraud is not alone sufficient to do so.<\/p>\n<p>The claim of joint ownership through inheritance by Apurado et al. is met by \nBroce et al. with Exhibit 5, which is a notarial document of purchase and sale \nof the land in question, executed by Carlos Apurado in favor of his son-in-law, \nGregorio Broce. This document is dated April 3, 1886. According to the statement \ntherein it is signed by Filomeno Apurado at the request of Carlos Apurado \nbecause he did not know how to write. There were also some sixteen witnesses. \nThe document was protocolized July 15, 1886. Several objections are made to the \nacceptance of this instrument as a valid' notarial document. The discussion of \nthis question by the trial court leaves nothing to be desired. The instrument in \nquestion must be considered as a notarial document. And, as stated by the trial \ncourt, even did it not possess the formalities of a notarial document, its \nefficacy as a private document is unimpaired, and, as such, it is binding \nbetween the parties and their privies.<\/p>\n<p>There is nothing like adequate testimony in the record that any promise was \never made by the registered, owners to the Apurados that they would have the \nland registered as jointly owned by the two families. We can not overlook the \nfact that these protestants remained silent for nearly five years during which \nthe registration proceedings were pending with the full knowledge, according to \ntheir own statements, that the Broce children were seeking to have the land \nregistered. This acquiescence in the proceedings carried on with such publicity \nand for so long a time by the registered owners in their own names, appears \nincompatible with an agreement between them and the present petitioners to have \nthe land registered as their joint property. And furthermore it has been clearly \nproved that Carlos Apurado sold the estate to Gregorio Broce, father of the \npresent registered owners.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from, denying the petition \nseeking a review of the decree of registration, is affirmed; with costs of this \ninstance against the appellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

From that sentence the defendant appealed to this court and makes \nthree assignments of error, each of which, however, raises a question of fact \nonly, relating to the sufficiency of the proof adduced during the trial of the \ncause to support the sentence imposed.\n<p>From the evidence it appears that on or about the 22d day of May, 1890, the \ndefendant was joined in the bonds of holy matrimony to one Hipolita Rosario; \nthat he continued to live with the said Rosario as her husband until the year \n1896, or 1897, when he was deported by the Spanish Government from the \nPhilippine Islands to the island of Guam; that he remained in the island of Guam \nuntil the year 1901 or 1902, when he returned to the Philippine Islands; that \nwhile he remained in the island of Guam he acted as a clerk or escribiente in \nthe court of first instance in said island; that when he returned to the \nPhilippine Islands he found that his wife, Hipolita Rosario, had been living and \ncohabiting with one Gregorio Malinit, and that as a result of such illicit \ncohabitation the said Hipolita Rosario had given birth to two children during \nthe absence of the defendant; that within a short period after the return of the \ndefendant from the island of Guam, he, being informed of the illicit relations \nof his wife with the said Gregorio Malinit, commenced proceedings to be divorced \nfrom his wife, Hipolita Rosario, in the Court of First Instance of the Province \nof Pangasinan; that after the trial of the said divorce proceedings, the court \nfound that the facts justified the petition of the plaintiff (the defendant, \nVictoriano Joanino) and granted the divorce prayed for; that thereafter, on the \n9th day of May, 1908, he was joined in wedlock with one Maria Roque; that at the \ntime of the second marriage the said Hipolita Rosario was still living.<\/p>\n<p>During the trial of the cause the defendant admitted all of the foregoing \nfacts. He attempted, however, to justify his second marriage upon the ground \nthat he believed that when a divorce had been granted him he had a right to \nremarry. He alleged that while he was in the island of Guam he had known some \ncases in which a divorce had been granted and where the parties had remarried. \nHe admitted, however, that at the time he was granted a divorce from his wife, \nHipolita Rosario, he had been informed by the court that the divorce which had \nbeen granted him did not permit him to remarry; that the divorce which had been \ngranted him amounted to nothing more or less than a decree of separation\u2014a \ndecree of separation from bed and board simply.<\/p>\n<p>In this court the defendant, through his attorney, has filed a very \ninteresting brief, in which he attempts to justify his second marriage upon the \nground of his belief of the fact that when a divorce had been granted to parties \nunder the laws of the Philippine Islands they were permitted to remarry during \nthe life of the former spouse. He presents much argument and many facts which \nappeal to the sympathy of the court. His arguments and his facts can in no way \ninfluence the decision of the court when there are positive rules of law \ngoverning in such cases. His arguments would be proper in asking for clemency \nfrom the executive department of the Government. He cites no authorities, either \nstatutory or judicial, in support of his contention that the defendant, having \nbeen divorced simply from his former spouse, had a right to remarry.<\/p>\n<p>Under the <em>laws<\/em> in force in the Philippine Islands, <em>the granting \nof a divorce does in no way annul the marriage.<\/em> <em>The divorce does not \ndestroy the marriage vinculum.<\/em> (Law 3, Title 2, Partida 4.)<\/p>\n<p>Said Law 3, Title 2, of the fourth Partida, among other things, provides the \nfollowing: \"Yet, with all this, they (husband and wife) may separate, if one of \nthem commit the sin of adultery,; or join any religious order, with the consent \nof the other, after they have known each other carnally. And notwithstanding \nthey separate for one of these causes, no longer to live together, <em>yet the \nmarriage is not dissolved on that ground.\" <\/em>(See also Law A, Title 10, \nPartida 4.)<\/p>\n<p>We find also that Law 7, Title 2, Partida 4, provides, among other things, as \nfollows: \"So great is the tie and force of marriage, that when legally \ncontracted it cannot be dissolved, notwithstanding one of the parties should \nturn heretic, or Jew, or Moor, or should commit adultery. Nevertheless, from any \nof these causes they may be separated by a judgment of the church, so as to live \nno longer together, nor to have any carnal intercourse with one another, \naccording to what is said in the title on the clergy, in the law which begins \nwith the words 'otorgandose algunos.' \" <\/p>\n<p>In the case of Benedicto <em>vs.<\/em> De la Rama (3 Phil. Rep., 34), and in \nnumerous other cases, this court has held that the above-quoted provisions of \nthe Partidas govern the question of divorce in the Philippine Islands. The \nchange of sovereignty from the Spanish to the American, even though such change \nhad the effect to transfer the power of granting divorces wholly to the civil \nauthorities, did in no way affect or change the effect of divorce. The effect of \na divorce granted under the law has not been changed, even though the \necclesiastical courts no longer exercise the power of granting a divorce.<\/p>\n<p>We find nothing either in the record or in the law governing the facts in the \npresent case, which justifies a reversal or a modification of the sentence \nimposed by the lower court.<\/p>\n<p>The same is, therefore, hereby affirmed, with costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Crossfield, judge, decided in favor of the plaintiff, Nicolas \nGatdula, declaring him to be a partner in the joint-account partnership \n(<em>sociedad de cuentas en participacion<\/em>) \"Los Obreros Pescadores,\" with \nan interest therein of P500; ordering the defendants, Simplicio Santos, Modesto \nSantos, and Jose Santiago to make an accounting of the management and \nadministration of the business of said company since the commencement thereof, \nand ordering the said defendants, Simplicio Santos and Modesto Santos, to pay \nthe costs; declaring the intervener Jose Santiago a partner in the said \njoint-account company with an interest of P1,000, without costs in his favor; \ndeclaring that the intervener Policarpia de los Santos has an interest of \nP3,709.75, with a mortgage for that amount on the building belonging to the \ncompany, which is now in the receiver's charge, without costs in her favor; \ndeclaring the organization known as \"Los Obreros Pescadores\" to be dissolved and \nthat, after making the accounting as ordered in the judgment, all the property \nbelonging to the said company \"Los Obreros Pescadores\" be distributed among \nthose persons who are entitled to share in the business of said company; and \nthat the receiver continue to discharge the duties of his office until the \ncompany shall have been dissolved and its business wound up.\n<p>By an instrument dated August 28, 1912, counsel for Nicolas Gatdula filed a \ncomplaint in the Court of First Instance of Manila, alleging as a cause of \naction that in the month of January, 1907, for the purpose of securing the good \nname and interests thereof the joint-account company denominated \"Los Obreros \nPescadores\" was constituted; articles of partnership were drawn up among the \npartners Simplicio Santos, Modesto Santos, Mateo Felix, Andres Antonio, and the \nplaintiff Nicolas Gatdula, to engage in buying and selling fish and shipping and \nselling same on commission; that the plaintiff, being a partner and possessing \nstock of the value of P500, was eliminated as such partner from the said company \n\"Los Obreros Pescadores\" by the manager thereof, Simplicio Santos, who put in \nhis place third parties who were not legitimate partners; that notwithstanding \nthe repeated demands of the other partners, the manager Simplicio Santos never \ndistributed dividends among the share holders, because there were no funds to \ndistribute, as the former cashier, Mateo Felix, had embezzled over P25,000; that \nthis alleged embezzlement of P25,000, the reason for the failure to distribute \ndividends, was wholly pretended and fictitious; that the manager, Simplicio \nSantos, in connivance with the present cashier, Modesto Santos, had falsely made \ndebts to appear against the company to its prejudice; that the manager Simplicio \nSantos and the cashier Modesto Santos made the fish-salting establishment, \ncalled \"Umbuyan Katagalugan,\" located in the barrio of Bancusay of the Tondo \ndistrict of the city of Manila, appear as a separate industry, capitalized \nindependently of the company, although it was the property of the company \"Los \nObreros Pescadores;\" wherefore judgment was asked declaring the plaintiff \nNicolas Gatdula to be a partner in the company \"Los Obreros Pescadores;\" that \nthe company be dissolved and the partners be paid their respective portion of \nthe capital and amounts due as dividends; that the establishment for salting \nfish, called \"Umbuyan Katagalugan,\" be included as property belonging to the \ncompany \"Los Obreros Pescadores;\" that a receiver be appointed by the court and \nthat the defendants Simplicio Santos and Modesto Santos indemnify the plaintiff \nfor the damages that have resulted from bad management of the business, and pay \nthe costs.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants, Simplicio Santos and Modesto Santos, in answer to the \ncomplaint, denied the facts therein contained, and alleged that the defendant \nSimplicio Santos had never been required to distribute dividends; that he had \nnever handled money of the company, nor had he ever had anything to do with the \ncompany funds, just as he had never stated that the funds of the company had \nbeen embezzled; that the plaintiff Nicolas Gatdula is not a partner in \"Los \nObreros Pescadores,\" but a mere employee in said company on a fixed salary; that \nalthough it was true that the plaintiff Nicolas Gatdula had been included as a \npartner in the articles of partnership it was at his own request, and that after \nsaid articles had been signed the plaintiff Gatdula informed the defendants that \nhe had given up the idea of becoming a partner in said company, wherefore he did \nnot pay any part of the amount of his share. As a counterclaim, they set forth \nthat the plaintiff well knew that he was not a partner in \"Los Obreros \nPescadores,\" although with unheard-of audacity he had instituted this action \nagainst the defendants, thereby damaging them in the sum of P2,000, incurred for \nexpenses of defense; wherefore they prayed that the court render judgment \ndeclaring that the plaintiff, Nicolas Gatdula, had no right to institute this \naction against the defendants and that he be ordered to pay them the sum of \nP2,000 as damages, and another P2,000 as prayed for in the counterclaim.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff answered the counterclaim of the defendants with a general and \nspecific denial of all the allegations therein contained.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants, Andres Antonio, Jose Flor Mata, and Mateo Felix, answered the \ncomplaint filed by Nicolas Gatdula, admitting that the latter is a partner in \n\"Los Obreros Pescadores;\" that in January, 1907, a joint-account company \ndenominated \"Los Obreros Pescadores\" was formed among the plaintiff and all the \ndefendants, articles of partnership being drawn up therefor; that since its \nformation the said company had never paid dividends among the shareholders, the \nmanager Simplicio Santos alleging that there were no funds because the cashier \nMateo Felix had embezzled over P25,000; as a special defense they alleged that \nthey never had any share in the management of the business of the company, \nexcept that from the year 1905 until August 4, 1907, Andres Antonio had held the \noffice of collector, Jose Flor Mata that of secretary, and Mateo Felix that of \ncashier, this last one having been sued by the board of directors in the year \n1908 for a shortage of over P25,000 of the company's funds, the complaint being \nafterwards dismissed; that the defendants had never opposed the liquidation and \ndissolution of the company \"Los Obreros Pescadores;\" that after the filing of \nsaid complaint Antonio and Flor Mata discovered that the said embezzlement had \nbeen simulated, and that there had been other frauds in the management, \nwherefore they had filed claims against said Santos and Santiago. In conclusion \nthey prayed that they be absolved from the complaint; that the said company be \ndissolved; that a receiver be appointed and that the legitimate partners be paid \ntheir respective shares in the business.<\/p>\n<p>At the request of the plaintiff and by a vote of the majority of the \nstockholders of \"Los Obreros Pescadores,\" the court on November 26,1912, \nappointed Mateo Felix receiver of the property of the said company, the \ndefendants Simplicio and Modesto Santos excepting thereto. In the motion \nopposing the appointment of Mateo Felix as receiver, filed by the defendants on \nDecember 3, 1912, Jose Santiago set up a claim of intervention, alleging that he \nwas a profit-sharing partner in \"Los Obreros Pescadores,\" he having two shares, \nworth P1,000.<\/p>\n<p>On January 4, 1913, after the property of the company, including the \nestablishment for salting fish, called \"Umbuyan Katagalugan,\" in Bancusay, \nTondo, had been turned over to the receiver Mateo Felix, Policarpia de los \nSantos set up a claim of intervention, alleging that she was the owner of said \nfish-salting establishment, she having expended in its construction the sum of \nP3,709.75, which she had given her sons Simplicio and Modesto Santos for that \npurpose; that when the receiver Mateo Felix took over the said establishment the \nbusiness was in bad repute with the public; that from December 3, 1912, until \nthe date of the filing of this claim of intervention, scarcely any business \ncould be transacted in said fish-salting establishment, owing to the discredit \ncaused by the receiver and by Jose Flor Mata and Andres A. Felix, she having \nbeen damaged thereby in an amount not less than P2,500; wherefore she prayed \nthat the court order the establishment \"Umbijyan Katagalugan\" to be excluded \nfrom the property of the company \"Los Obreros Pescadores\" and that he direct \nNicolas Gatdula, Mateo A. Felix, Andres A. Felix, and Jose Flor Mata, jointly \nand severally, to pay to the intervenes the damages they had caused her.<\/p>\n<p>After trial of the case and examination of the evidence submitted by \nboth.parties, the court rendered the decision mentioned. The defendants \nSimplicio Santos and Modesto Santos and the interveners Jose Santiago and \nPolicarpia de los Santos excepted thereto and prayed for a reopening of the case \nand a new trial. This motion was denied, the petitioners excepting to the \nruling. A bill of exceptions was filed, approved and forwarded to the clerk of \nthis court.<\/p>\n<p>The questions to be decided in this suit are: whether the plaintiff Nicolas \nGatdula and the intervener Jose Santiago form part as members of the joint-stock \ncompany denominated \"Los Obreros Pescadores;\" whether the other intervener, \nPolicarpia de los Santos, is entitled to share in the property of said company \nto the extent of P3,709.75, as proprietor of the fish-salting establishment in \nBancusay, Tondo; whether or not the defendants Simplicio Santos, Modesto Santos \nand the said Jose Santiago should be ordered to make an accounting, the company \nbe dissolved, and the property thereof be distributed among the stockholders in \nthe business.<\/p>\n<p>It has been duly proven in the case that Nicolas Gatdula is a member of the \njoint-account partnership \"Los Obreros Pescadores,\" for that is demonstrated by \nthe articles of partnership of said company, Exhibit B (pp. 35-43), executed in \nManila on January 17,1907, by Simplicio Santos, Modesto Santos, Mateo A. Felix, \nAndres A. Felix, and the defendant Nicolas Gatdula. It appears in the second \nclause of said articles of partnership that the net capital of the company was \nP5,250 Philippine currency; and according to the twelfth clause thereof the \nplaintiff Nicolas Gatdula was elected a member of the board of directors of \"Los \nObreros Pescadores\" with voice and vote therein. Although the respective amounts \ncontributed by each partner to the capital does not appear, the plaintiff has \nshown by parol evidence that each of the partners executing those articles \ncontributed P500, Philippine currency, which, added to the capital of its \npredecessor \"La Consignataria,\" constituted the assets of the company \"Los \nObreros Pescadores.\"<\/p>\n<p>The defendants have attempted to prove that Nicolas Gatdula is not a member \nof the firm \"Los Obreros Pescadores,\" as he neither could nor can exhibit the \ncorresponding receipt to show that he paid the amount of his share of P500 \nPhilippine currency; that while it is true that Gatdula signed the articles of \npartnership, Exhibit B, yet later it was agreed that he should cease to belong \nto the company, so he did not pay the whole nor any part of his share.<\/p>\n<p>Paragraph F of clause 19 of the said articles of partnership provides that \nthe board of directors is empowered to issue the corresponding certificates to \nthe partners, as is usual and ordinary in every commercial company or firm, but \nit does not appear in the record that any of the subscribers to the articles of \npartnership of the company \"Los Obreros Pescadores\" received the certificate or \ndocument showing that he had paid his share in the company and that he had been \nadmitted as such member. Therefore it must be conceded, according to the \nevidence submitted by the plaintiff Nicolas Gatdula, that all the subscribers to \nthe articles of partnership paid their respective quotas or shares, since \notherwise they would not have been permitted to sign those articles.<\/p>\n<p>The only partner who exhibited a receipt for payment to the company of the \nvalue of his shares is the intervener Jose Santiago. He presented the receipt \nExhibit A-l (p. 196) signed by Simplicio Santos and Mateo A. Felix, manager and \ntreasurer respectively of the company \"Los Obreros Pescadores,\" showing that he \nhad purchased two shares in the said company and had paid their value of P1,000. \nThe existence of this receipt is explained by the simple reason that Jose \nSantiago did not sign the articles of partnership, Exhibit B, and it does not \nappear therein that he was a partner in \"Los Obreros Pescadores,\" so when he \npurchased two shares in the company it-was necessary to issue a receipt for the \ntwo shares he had paid in, the receipt to serve at the same time as a \ncertificate of partnership in said company. From the foregoing we must conclude \nthat the partners executing the articles of partnership of the company \"Los \nObreros Pescadores\" paid their respective shares, although no receipts were \nissued to them therefor, the fact that they had executed and signed said \ninstrument being sufficient as acknowledging them to be such partners and as \nhaving paid in their respective quotas. This is the situation of the plaintiff \nGatdula, who signed those articles.<\/p>\n<p>As grounds for the dissolution of the company and the demand for an \naccounting it is alleged that the managers and administrators thereof, Simplicio \nSantos, Modesto Santos, and Jose Santiago, have conducted the business badly and \nhave committed frauds in their operations, for it is asserted that, in addition \nto this suit, there are two joined actions pending in the Court of First \nInstance of this city between the same parties; No. 8127, instituted by Andres \nAntonio Felix against Simplicio Santos, the manager of the company; and No. \n8255, prosecuted by Jose Flor Mata against Jose Santiago, Modesto Santos, and \nSimplicio Santos, personally and as managers of the said company, and the \nintervener Mateo Antonio Felix. In these actions, judgment was rendered on July \n3, 1912, whereby Judge Del Rosario ordered the defendants, Simplicio and Modesto \nSantos, manager and cashier respectively of the said company, to make an \naccounting of the liquidation within thirty days from the time that the judgment \nof the Supreme Court in case No. 6271, prosecuted by the defendants against the \nsaid Mateo Antonio Felix, should become final; that the account they would \nrender would have to depend upon the result of the accounts kept by the former \ncashier Mateo Antonio Felix, as found correct by the Supreme Court in that case; \nand that after the accounts had been approved by the court and each participant \nhad been paid what was due him, the interest of each of the parties now \ninterested in the company \"Los Obreros Pescadores\" should cease (p, 1117). This \njudgment is now pending execution in the Court of First Instance; it does not \nappear that any exception has been taken to it, and the accounts rendered are \nnow awaiting the approval of the court. It is to be noted that Nicolas Gatdula \nappeared in one of said cases and prayed that he be permitted to intervene as an \ninterested party in said company.<br\/><br\/>In the articles of partnership of \"Los \nObreros Pescado res,\" Exhibit B (pp. 35-43), it is provided among other things \nthat the duration of the company shall be ten years, counting from January 17, \n1907. In article 12 it is stipulated that a monthly arid semi-annual balance \nshall be struck, which may be examined by the partners for fifteen and thirty \ndays respectively. It is also provided that all the partners are entitled to \nreceive dividends after each semi-annual balance. In article 16 it is determined \nthat there will be a regular meeting of partners the first Sunday of the months \nof January and July of each year, for approving the accounts and balances, to \nreceive dividends, to make desirable reforms, and to hear the reports that might \nbe presented. Article 23 prescribes that the treasurer must count the cash three \ntimes a week and report the result thereof to the board of directors, that he \nshall pay dividends every six months and that he alone shall be responsible for \nall sums paid into the company fund. Finally, under article 24, the company \ncould be dissolved by the expiration of the period therefor, by loss in the \nbusiness of ten per cent of the capital, by bankruptcy of the company, and by \nmutual agreement of the parties.<\/p>\n<p>It has been fully demonstrated that through' fault and negligence of said \ncompany's board of directors, which, under the provisions of article 20, was \nobligated strictly to enforce all the terms of the said instrument, none of \nthese stipulations of the articles of partnership has been carried out or \nexecuted.<\/p>\n<p>During the five years and a half and more that said company was in operation, \nthat is, from January 17, 1907, until the filing of the complaint herein on \nAugust 28, 1912, no regular meeting of stockholders was held, but there were two \nextraordinary meetings, the first in the house of the bookkeeper Avellana on \nSeptember 4, 1907 (Exhibit 2, p. 206), and the second in the house of the \ndirector Jose Santiago (sten. notes, 32), solely to consider the alleged \nembezzlement of over P25,000 committed by the cashier Mateo A. Felix; that \nmonthly and semi-annual balances were not struck, nor was the cash counted, \nsomething which the cashier ought to have done three times a week, for it \nappears that the accounts of the company were not properly kept, as the record \nshows; and that since the formation of the said company dividends were never \npaid, in spite of the demands therefor made by various partners. For these \nreasons the plaintiff Nicolas Gatdula and the defendants Andres Antonio, Jose \nFlor Mata, and Mateo<br\/>A. Felix prayed that the company be dissolved, and that \nan accounting be had, a prayer that has been opposed by the other defendants, \nSimplicio Santos and Modesto Santos, and the intervener Jose Santiago.<\/p>\n<p>There can be no question that the majority of the partners seek an \naccounting, and the dissolution and liquidation of the company, because of the \nviolation of certain clauses in the articles of partnership, whereby the company \nand its members have been damaged. The court found said claim to be just, since \nthe grounds therefor were held to be established, and allowed it in the judgment \nappealed from. It does not appear that the appellants assigned any error on \nthese points, so according to established jurisprudence, the judgment can not be \nrevised as to the portions that refer to the liquidation and dissolution of the \ncompany \"Los Obreros Pescadores.\"<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the appointment of a receiver, the parties litigant agreed \nupon the necessity of appointing one for the property of the company, wherefore \nthe court directed them to choose one from among themselves, the choice falling \nupon Mateo A. Felix, who received four out of the six votes. Consequently he was \nappointed receiver by the court, after filing a bond of fl0,000 Philippine \ncurrent After the motion of the defendants Simplicio and Modesto Santos to \nreconsider this appointment of Mateo A. Felix was denied, they excepted to the \nruling and in this instance alleged that under section 174 of the Code of Civil \nProcedure the appointment of the receiver was improper. The second paragraph of \nsaid section 174 clearly provides that a receiver may be appointed when it is \nmade to appear by the complaint or answer and by such other proof as the judge \nmay require, that the party making the application for the appointment of a \nreceiver has an interest in the property or fund which is the subject of the \naction and when it is shown that the property or fund is in danger of being \nlost, removed, or materially injured unless a receiver is appointed to guard and \npreserve it. Aside from the fact that the appointment of Mateo A. Felix as \nreceiver was made by the court in accordance with law, the defendants Simplicio \nand Modesto Santos themselves agree with the plaintiff in the expediency of \nappointing a receiver. The controversy turns solely upon the person appointed, \nwho does not suit the defendant Santos brothers. This divergence of opinion is \nnot sufficient cause, nor does any other reason exist, for setting aside the \norder of the Court of First Instance appointing the said Mateo A. Felix receiver \nof the property of the company \"Los Obreros Pescadores.\"<\/p>\n<p>With respect to the fish-salting establishment called \"Umbuyan Katagalugan,\" \nlocated in the Tondo district, it has been proven in the case that this forms a \npart of the property belonging to \"Los Obreros Pescadores,\" for the fish of the \nsaid company were therein salted, smoked, and stored. A part of the building was \noccupied by the office of the company, and the manager paid the wages of the \nlaborers who worked therein.<\/p>\n<p>The intervener, Policarpia de los Santos, mother of the defendants Simplicio \nand Modesto Santos, claims to be the exclusive owner of the building in \nquestion, although in her claim of intervention she alleged that her sons \nSimplicio and Modesto Santos, as her representatives, asked her permission to \nemploy some of her capital in its erection. It is proven that the intervener has \nbeen paying the rental of the ground on which said building is erected (pp. \n231-236); that she spent the sum of P3,709.75 in the construction thereof (p. \n225), which appears to have been built by Santiago Reyes in 1911; and that after \nits completion a notarial instrument was executed, in which it was set forth \nunder date of November 16, 1911, that the said building was the property of the \nintervener Policarpia de los Santos. This document is not inscribed in the \nproperty registry as proof of the intervener's claim.<\/p>\n<p>The witness Mateo Buson testified that the company \"Los Obreros Pescadores \npaid a monthly rental of P15 for the use of the building, but aside from this \ntestimony it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the company was her \nlessee in the occupation thereof. The mere fact that \"Los Obreros Pescadores\" \noccupied the building without paying rent gives rise to the presumption that it \nbelongs to the said company. Policarpia de los Santos is entitled to collect the \nsum of P3,709.75, which she lent to the company for constructing the building, \nbut in the absence of proof of her claim she cannot be considered the owner \nthereof.<\/p>\n<p>For these reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from \nare held to be refuted and since the same is in accordance with law, it must be \naffirmed, as we do affirm it, and the plaintiff is absolved from the \ncounterclaim, with the costs against the appellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

No other evidence was offered in support of the allegations of the \ncomplaint.<\/p>\n<p>Exhibit A is, in the language of the trial judge, \"a certificate issued by \nthe provincial fiscal of Ilocos Sur, in his capacity of register of deeds of the \nProvince of Ilocos Sur, wherein it is set forth that the Church of Bantay, \nIlocos Sur, then represented by its former parish priest, applied for a \npossessory information of the properties in question and in the proceedings had \nfor the purpose proved the possession of the Church of Bantay, Ilocos Sur, now \nthe plaintiff, over the said properties for a period of more than thirty years, \nin which proceedings record was also made of the encumbrances that bear on the \nreal estate mentioned and which are as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"(1) That the church, the initiator of these proceedings, shall never sell, \nmortgage, or alienate the properties without the knowledge and consent of the \nresidents of the pueblo of Bantay, who donated them to the said church; (2) that \nthe usufruct of the said lands shall, upon payment of rent, or canon, always \npertain to the residents of the pueblo of Bantay; (3) that the administration of \nthe properties shall always lie with the parish priest of the church of the said \npueblo; and, (4) that, when the municipality has not sufficient revenue to meet \nits required expenditures, an amount not exceeding P200 may be expended for this \npurpose from the income of the said land.<\/p>\n<p>\"On April 18, 1895, the parcels above mentioned, together with the charges on \neach of them, were recorded in the property registry of the Province of Ilocos \nSur, section of the pueblo of Bantay, by virtue of the said possessory \ninformation.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It nowhere, appears that the defendant municipality was cited to appear, or \ndid in fact appear in the course of the proceedings.<\/p>\n<p>The single witness called on behalf of the plaintiff testified substantially \nas follows: That he was a clerk (escribiente) of the Church at Bantay; that he \nhad formerly been one of the headmen (principalia) of the municipality of \nBantay; that formerly the lands in question were owned by the citizens of Bantay \nadministered by the headmen (principalia) of that municipality; that thereafter \nthe headmen of the town donated the land in question to the Church of Bantay; \nthat although he himself signed the document donating the land he could not say \nwhen it was executed; that the parish priest at one time was administrator of \nthe land in question, but he was not able to say when or under what conditions; \nthat he knew that this was so, because in the performance of his duties as a \nclerk of the church, he remembered having helped to store the crops from these \nlands underneath the convent of the Church of Bantay, though he could not say \nwhen nor how often this had been done.<\/p>\n<p>In connection with the testimony of this witness it is worthy of observation \nthat in the \"informacion posesoria\" executed in 1895 at the instance of the \nparish priest of Bantay, there is no intimation that the alleged donation of the \nlands in question was made or evidenced in a written instrument. On the \ncontrary, in reference to one of the smaller parcels included in the larger \ntract now in question, we find the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Friar Lizardo Villanueva, an Augustinian brother and parish priest of the \npueblo of Bantay, went to the justice of the peace court of that town and prayed \nthat he be allowed to prove that the church under his charge had been in \npossession of the above-described hacienda for more than thirty years; that it \nhad acquired it by donation from the residents of the said pueblo, and that the \nproperty had been acquired without any written instrument.\" <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This express admission, taken together with the fact that in the execution of \nthe \"informacion posesoria\" in the year 1895, the applicant, the parish priest \nof Bantay, relied wholly on the oral testimony of a few witnesses in support of \nhis allegations as to a gift (donaci6n) from the municipality of the entire \ntract, and made no claim that the alleged gift had been made in writing, and the \nfurther fact that no Written instruments were offered at the trial of the case \nat bar other than the \"informacion posesoria\u201d justifies the inference that no \nwriting evidencing the alleged gift was in fact executed. And however this may \nbe, it is certain that the existence of such a writing was neither alleged nor \nproven in the court below.<\/p>\n<p>The evidence submitted on behalf of the defendant municipality consisted in \npart of authentic, undisputed documents, conclusively establishing the fact that \ntwo of the parcels of land composing the entire tract in question were conveyed \nto the defendant municipality by the Augustinian Fathers in or about the years \n1791 and 1803; and that the third was conveyed to it by one Dona Calixta del \nCastillo about 1851. The fact that this property was thus acquired by the \ndefendant municipality is not denied by the plaintiff, who, indeed, claims title \nthrough the municipality by virtue of an alleged gift (donacion).<\/p>\n<p>Two witnesses, former headmen of the municipality of Bantay, were called by \njthe defendant municipality, who swore positively that no such gift had ever \nbeen made as that alleged in the complaint, and that neither the church nor its \nrepresentatives ever had possession or control of the land in question.<\/p>\n<p>It is manifest that plaintiff's allegations of title and of right to \npossession, as set forth in the record in this case, must stand or fall in \naccordance with the effect which should be given to the registered \"informacion \nposesoria\" (possessory information) prepared in the month of March, 1895, and \nregistered on the 18th of April of that year. Indeed, counsel for plaintiff rest \ntheir contentions in this court wholly and exclusively on the probative value \nwhich they insist should be accorded that instrument.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Possessory informations\" of the nature of the one under consideration herein \nwere ex parte proceedings had before a judge of first instance or a justice of \nthe peace, wherein one in possession of real estate, claiming the right to \npossession, was permitted after notice to the adjoining landowners to set forth \nthe fact that he was in actual possession of such real estate and the nature of \nthe title under which he claimed the right of possession, and to call such \nwitnesses and to produce such evidence in support of his claim as he thought \nnecessary and proper. If the evidence thus submitted appeared to be \nsatisfactory, and the applicant's claims were not successfully rebutted by some \ninterested person the proceedings were approved by the judge before whom they \nwere had, who at the same time ordered that they be registered \"without \nprejudice to third persons having a better right in the premises.\" From a \nconsideration of the very nature of such <em>ex parte<\/em> proceedings it is \nclear that in themselves they could in no event have the effect of prejudicing a \nthird person who has a better right to the ownership than the claimant in the \npossessory proceedings. When executed in due form, they furnish, at most, prima \nfacie evidence of the fact that at the time of their execution, the claimant was \nin possession, claiming the right to possession as set forth in his application. \nAccordingly we find in article 394 of the Mortgage Law the following:<\/p>\n<p>\"The period of possession which appears to have elapsed at the time said \nentries are made shall be computed for the prescription which does not require a \njust title, unless a person prejudiced thereby denies it, in which case said \nperiod of possession must be proven in accordance with the common law.<\/p>\n<p>\"Entries of possession shall prejudice or favor third , persons from the date \nof their record, but only with regard to the effects which the laws attribute to \nmere possession.<\/p>\n<p>\"The entry of possession shall not prejudice the person who has a better \nright to the ownership of the realty, although his title has not been recorded, \nunless the prescription has confirmed and secured the claim recorded. Between \nthe parties the possession shall be effectual from the date prescribed by the \ncommon law.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It is true that provision is made whereby the possession evidenced by a \nregistered possessory information may ripen and be converted into a record of \nownership after twenty years of uninterrupted possession have elapsed from the \ndate of entry (art. 393, Mortgage Law), but the title thus secured is no more \nthan a statutory title by prescription, and, as we have seen, until the full \nperiod of twenty years has elapse, a registered possessory information cannot \nprejudice a third person with a better right in the premises. It is true also \nthat under the provisions of the Maura Law, persons holding under a registered \npossessory information secured during the very short period during which it was \nin force, were given a title\u2014as against the Government\u2014to public lands claimed \nby them; but the provisions of this law in no wise affected the rights of \nclaimants other than the Government itself. It is very clear therefore, that the \npossessory information submitted by plaintiff in the case at bar cannot prevail \nagainst the authentic and undisputed proof of title to the lands in question in \nthe defendant municipality.<\/p>\n<p>Let judgment be entered reversing the judgment entered in the court below and \ndismissing the complaint filed in this case, without costs to either party.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C, J., Torres, Moreland, Trent<\/em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> \nconcur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

The petitioner asked that five parcels of land particularly \ndescribed in the first paragraph of his. Complaint, all located within the \njurisdiction of the pueblo of Davao, on the Island of Mindanao, be registered \nunder the Torrens system. The petitioner alleged that if the court should find \nthat he was not entitled to have said parcels of land registered by reason of \nownership, that the same should be registered in his name in accordance with the \nprovisions of chapter 6 of Act No. 926. The petitioner alleged that said parcels \nof land contain 1,785 hectares.\n<p>On the 3d day of May, 1907; Gregorio Araneta, Attorney-General, appeared on \nbehalf of the opponent in said cause.<\/p>\n<p>On the 30th of August, 1907, the petitioner presented an amended complaint, \nasking for the registration of the said parcels of land. In the amended \ncomplaint; the petitioner alleged that the said five parcels of land contained \n1,511 hectares 38 ares and 24 centares.<\/p>\n<p>On the 31st day of January, 1908, the petitioner presented a motion in said \ncause, asking for permission to withdraw his action, reserving to himself the \nright \"to reproduce it later in another suit.\" <\/p>\n<p>On the 16th day of October, 1908, Juan Sumulong, associate judge of the Court \nof Land Registration, granted said petition in the following words: \"On motion \nby the petitioner, the petition in this case is dismissed, without prejudice to \nhis reproducing the same whenever he may deem it advisable so to do.\"<\/p>\n<p>About eighteen months later, on the 22d day of March, 1910, the petitioner \nappeared in court and asked that his original cause of action be revived.

That, on the date of October 16, 1908, this honorable court issued the \nfollowing order:<\/p>\n<p>\" 'On motion by the petitioner, the petition in this case is dismissed, \nwithout prejudice to his reproducing the same whenever he may deem it advisable \nso to do.<\/p>\n<p>\"'Manila, P.

That, about the 1st of April, 1910, on motion by the petitioner, Judge \nBenitez issued an order granting the reopening of this case and assigning a date \nfor the hearing.<\/p>\n<p>\"3. That the order granting a reopening of this case is contrary to law: (a) \nBecause it was issued after the lapse of more than one year from the date of the \norder of dismissal; and (b) because in the order of dismissal, dated October 16, \n1908, the petitioner was only granted the right to reproduce his \napplication.<\/p>\n<p>\"4. That the question here involved and now sought to have decided is of \ngreat importance for the procedure that must in future be followed by this court \nin similar cases; and a ruling on the point in discussion is required of this \ncourt, to avoid appeals that might cause unnecessary expense to the litigating \nparties.<\/p>\n<p>\"Therefore the undersigned Attorney-General prays that this point be \nconsidered by the court in bane, and that after due hearing the order of this \ncourt dated April 1, 1910, be set aside, with the declaration that the reopening \nof this case was improper.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Said motion was referred to the consideration of three judges of the Court of \nLand Registration, sitting in bane. Upon due consideration, said judges decided \nthat they, by virtue of the provisions of section 8 of Act No. 1648, had no \njurisdiction to intervene in said cause, for the purpose of modifying or \nreversing the said order of Judge Benitez, reinstating said cause, of April \n1,1910.<\/p>\n<p>Section 8 of said Act No. 1648, provides: \"Upon a decision being rendered by \nany judge serving on the Court of Land Registration, either party in interest \nmay, within thirty days after the decision is rendered by such judge, petition \nthe court in bane, consisting of all the judges serving on the court, or at \nleast three of said judges, for a rehearing of the case, and, if it shall appear \nto such court in bane that the decision on which a rehearing is asked is in \nconflict with any previous decision of the court, or of any judge thereof, or \nwith any decision of the Supreme Court of these Islands, or of any other \ncompetent appellate tribunal, then the court in bane, may, in its discretion, by \nvote of a majority of its members, grant the rehearing petitioned for, annul the \ndecision of the single judge, and rehear the case sitting in bane; and the \ndecision of the court in bane shall be the decision of the Court of Land \nRegistration in the case, and may be regularly appealed from as in other \ncases.\"<\/p>\n<p>On the 17th day of November, 1910, the Attorney-General presented his formal \nopposition to the registration of said parcels of land in question.<\/p>\n<p>On the 15th day of March, 1911, the petitioner again asked permission to \namend his complaint and to change the description of the land contained in \nparcel E.<\/p>\n<p>The cause was duly set down for trial and after hearing the evidence, the \nHonorable James A. Ostrand, associate judge, on the 23d day of January, 1912, \nrendered his decision, in which he denied the right of the plaintiff to have \nregistered in his name parcels A and B, described in the first paragraph of the \ncomplaint, for the reason that the evidence did not show that he was the owner \nof said land.<\/p>\n<p>The judge found that the evidence did show that the petitioner was entitled \nto have parcels C, D, and E, described in the first paragraph of the complaint, \nregistered. He granted the registration of said parcels C and D, under the \nprovisions of subsection 5 of section 54 of Act No. 926. The court granted the \nregistration of parcel E, because, as he found, the petitioner had been, by \nhimself and through his predecessors, in the open, continuous, exclusive and \nnotorious possession and occupation of said parcel, under a bona fide claim of \nownership for thirty years.<\/p>\n<p>On the 1st day of February, 1912, the Attorney-General duly excepted to the \norder of the judge granting the registration of said parcels C, D, and E, and on \nthe same day presented a motion for a new trial. Said motion for a new trial was \ndenied on the 2d day of February, 1912, to which order denying the motion for a \nnew trial, the Attorney- General duly excepted and presented his bill of \nexceptions and appeal to this court.<\/p>\n<p>In this court the Attorney-General presents two assignments of error, as \nfollows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I. The court incurred an error of law in declaring the case reopened by its \norder of April 1, 1910; and<\/p>\n<p>\"II. It likewise erred in decreeing the registration of the land, the subject \nmatter of the application, in favor of the petitioner, because it lacked \njurisdiction over the matter in litigation and over the person of the \npetitioner.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>With reference to the first assignment of error, it will be remembered that \nthe petitioner, on the 31st day of January, 1908, asked that he be permitted to \nretire his petition presented in said cause, \"reserving, however, the right to \nreproduce it afterwards in other proceedings;\" that said motion was granted on \nthe 16th day of October, 1908, with the condition: \"without prejudice to the \nsaid petitioner's reproducing it whenever he might deem it advisable so to do;\" \nthat more than seventeen months later (the 22d day of March, 1910), the \npetitioner asked that said cause be reinstated; that said cause was reinstated, \nby order of the court, and again placed upon the calendar on the 1st of April, \n1910.<\/p>\n<p>The Attorney-General, in support of his first assignment of error, contends \nthat the order of the court of the 1st of April, 1910, reinstating said cause \nwithout the presentation of a new petition and the citation of the parties \nagain, was illegal and done without authority of law and was beyond the \njurisdiction of the court. In support of his contention, the Attorney-General \ncites numerous decisions. He argues that the order of the court dismissing said \ncause, even conditionally (the 16th of October, 1908), became a final order, \nafter the lapse of the time within which an appeal might have been perfected; \nthat the action was thus terminated; that it could not be revived by \nreinstatement; that the only way that the action could be considered again by \nthe court was by the presentation of a new petition and a new citation of the \nparties. The Attorney-General argues that the decisions of the Court of Land \nRegistration become final after the expiration of the time within which the \ndefeated party might appeal. Section 14 of Act No. 496, as amended by section 1 \nof Act No. 1484, provides that parties desiring, to appeal from an order of the \nCourt of Land Registration must present their bills of exception within thirty \ndays, and that that time may be extended by the court for another thirty days. \nThe Attorney-General argues that if the appeal is not perfected within such \ntime, the judgment is final. It is argued by the Attorney-General that the \ngeneral rule is that the judge may alter or amend his decision in matters of \nsubstance, any time during the term within which such judgment is rendered, but \nthat after the termination of said term, the judge is without jurisdiction to \nmake any order in a cause terminated by a final decision, and that, inasmuch as \nthere are no terms, as such, for the Court of Land Registration, the judgment \nshould be final and cannot be altered or amended after the time has elapsed for \nthe perfection of the appeal.

S., 410), Mr. Justice Miller, \nspeaking for the Supreme Court of the United States, said: \"During the term when \nit is rendered or entered of record, a judgment or order, however conclusive in \nits character, is under the control of the court pronouncing it, and may then be \nset aside, vacated, or modified, after that term, unless steps be taken during \nits continuance, by motion or otherwise, errors in final judgments can only be \ncorrected by an appellate court.\"<\/p>\n<p>The record shows that the land, or at least some parcels, was occupied by \nothers than the petitioner at the time of the commencement of the action. Nearly \neighteen months had expired from the time the petitioner made a motion that his \npetition be dismissed, before he asked that the same be reinstated. So far as \nthe record shows no new notices or citations were issued to any of the parties \ninterested. Many other persons, during the eighteen months, might have acquired \nan interest in the land in question.<\/p>\n<p>In reply to the argument of the Attorney-General, relating to the finality of \nthe judgment dismissing the petition at the request of the petitioner, the \nattorney for the plaintiff cites section 37 of Act No. 496.<\/p>\n<p>Said section provides: \"If in any case the court finds that the applicant has \nnot proper title for registration, a decree shall be entered dismissing the \napplication, and such decree may be ordered to be without prejudice. The \napplicant may withdraw his application at any time before final decree, upon \nterms to be fixed by the court.\"<\/p>\n<p>The phrase in said section: \"and such decree (dismissing the application) may \nbe ordered to be without prejudice\/ simply means that the petitioner may again \ninstitute the same action for the same purpose, and nothing more. The provision \nof said section that \"the applicant may withdraw his application at any time \nbefore final decree, upon terms to be fixed by the court,\" does not contemplate \nthat the Court of Land Registration is authorized to dismiss an action with the \nright to reinstate it after the expiration of seventeen or eighteen months, \nwithout new notices and new citations to the parties interested. If a petitioner \nin the Court of Land Registration may be permitted to have his cause of action \ndismissed and have it reinstated again after the lapse of seventeen or eighteen \nmonths, without new citations and new notices to the parties, then he may have \nit reinstated after the lapse of any time. We do not believe that such a \nprocedure was contemplated by the legislature in adopting said section.<\/p>\n<p>The foregoing interpretation may work a hardship upon the petitioner in the \npresent case. We believe, however, that it is a safer rule to follow, even at \nthe cost of an occasional hardship, to adhere to the principle which we have \nannounced, and to refuse to recognize the right of a petitioner in a case like \nthe present, to have his action reinstated, without new citations and new \nnotices, after the lapse of the time within which an appeal might be perfected \nfrom the decision of the Court of Land Registration. We do not believe that the \nCourt of Land Registration, in dismissing a petition upon the application of the \npetitioner, with permission to reinstate the same, has a right to do so upon any \nterms which do not require that the parties shall be required, when the \napplication for reinstatement is made, to re-cite all the parties who may be \ninterested in the land in question.<\/p>\n<p>The attorney for the petitioner argues that the Attorney-General did not \nperfect his appeal within the time required by law and that therefore his appeal \nshould be dismissed. It will be remembered that the order of the lower court \nreinstating said cause was dictated on the 1st day of April, 1910. The motion of \nthe Attorney-General for a rehearing and his exception to said order was not \npresented until the 26th day of September, 1910. There is nothing in the record, \nhowever, which shows on what date the Attorney-General received notice of said \norder. The time within which he must present his exception or motion for a new \ntrial does not begin to run until after he has received notice of the order of \nthe court. Inasmuch as the record does not contain any proof as to the time when \nthe Attorney-General received notice of said order, we must conclude that his \nmotion and exception were presented in time.<\/p>\n<p>In view of the foregoing conclusions, we deem it unnecessary to discuss the \nsecond assignment of error.<\/p>\n<p>For all of the foregoing, the judgment of the lower court is hereby reversed, \nwithout prejudice to, the plaintiff, and, without any finding as to costs, it is \nso ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

1. 0 al \ndeclarar probado dicho delito de asesinato y 2. 0 al declarar al acusado \nconvicto del mismo delito.\n<p>En la querella se alega que en o hacia el 5 de Enero de 1901 en el municipio \nde Malinao, provincia de Capiz, de estas Islas el referido acusado voluntaria, \nilegal y criminalmente, con alevosia y premeditacion, hallandose Clodoaldo de \nVicente trepando en un arbol de coco, repentinamente y sin darle tiempo para \ndefenderse le assesto con el bolo de que estaba provisto dos golpes, uno en el \ncuello y otro en el abdomen, falleciendo en el acto de resultas de las heridas \nque recibiera el citado De Vicente.<\/p>\n<p>Declararon como testigos de la acusacion y presenciales del hecho referido en \nla querella la hermana y la cu\u00f1ada del occiso.<\/p>\n<p>Segun la primera, Felicia\u00f1a de Vicente, habiendo su hermano Clodoaldo \nregresado a su casa, en el citado pueblo de Malinao, al ponerse el sol el \nmencionado dia 5 de Enero de 1901 llevando consigo algunos pedazos de carne de \nun carabao que acababa de matar en el barrio de Leso, despues de entregarla la \ncarne y encargarla la que la cociera porque el iba a subir a un arbol de coco a \ndestilar tuba, subio, en efecto, en dicho arbol, el cual se hallaba a cinco \nbrazas de distancia de la casa, y hallandose en aquella operacion, como Gregorio \nInonog se acercara a el y le pidiera tuba por alegar derecho al terreno en que \nestaba dicho arbol, a lo cual se nego su hermano Clodoaldo, el Inonog, o sea, el \nacusado estando bajando aquel de dicho arbol y a una braza de distancia del \nsuelo, le dio una lanzada en el costado causandole una herida, por la cual le \nsalieron los intestinos, y ya en el suelo su hermano, el misno Inonog estando \naquel de espaldas le dio con su talibon un tajo en el cuello, el cual quedo casi \ncompletamente cortado, falleciendo inmediatamente despues su citado hermano.<\/p>\n<p>Marta Ollovira, cu\u00f1ada del occiso, que vivia en aquella fecha en la casa de \neste, declaro en iguales terminos que la testigo anterior, a\u00f1adiendo que ella \ncon el Teniente llamado Malo del barrio de Bigaa, de quien se hizo acompa\u00f1ar, \nporque tenia miedo, fue inmediatamente al pueblo a dar cuenta de lo ocurrido al \nPresidente Municipal, Agapito Iledan, quien la llevo al Comandante del \ndestacamento de Scouts que habia entonces alla.<\/p>\n<p>El testigo citado Agapito Iledan declaro, a su vez, que siendo Presidente \nMunicipal, entonces, del pueblo de Malinao, se le presento Marta Ollovira, \nacompa\u00f1ada del Teniente del barrio de Bigaa Romualdo Inta, dando parte de la \nmuerte de Clodoaldo de Vicente ocurrida aquella misma noche; que el vio el \ncadaver de dicho individuo cuando lo recogieron veinticinco soldados Scouts y un \nSargento de policia, el cual cadaver le fue entregado por el Comandante del \ndestacamento americano y tenia dos heridas: una en el abdomen, hacia el lado \nizquierdo, y por donde le salieron los intestinos, y otra en el pescuezo que \nestaba casi cortado; a\u00f1adiendo que habiendo sido arrestado dicho acusado y \nhallandose detenido en el cuartel, el le pregunto cual habia si do la causa de \nla muerte de Clodoaldo y por que el habia matado a este, y el acusado le \ncontesto que fue por un arbol de coco del cual se destilaba tuba, anadiendo \nfinalmente, que al tercer dia de estar arrestado el acusado fue puesto en \nlibertad, porque el Comandante americano del destacamento le dijo a el que no \npodian imponer al acusado la pena correspondiente, porque el Gobierno todavia no \nhabia dictado ninguna ley, pero que mas tarde podria presentarse denuncia contra \nel mismo.<\/p>\n<p>El Sargento de policia a quien se refirio el testigo anterior, llamado Luis \nYragana, declaro haber recogido el cadaver de Clodoaldo de Vicente, asi como \ntambien haber acompa\u00f1ado a los americanos y Scouts en aquella fecha cuando fue \narrestado el acusado, quien fue llevado por el Comandante americano al cuartel; \na\u00f1adiendo dicho testigo, ademas, que estando el acusado ante el cadaver de \nClodoaldo y presente el citado Comandante, este pregunto al acusado quien habia \nmatado a aquel, y el acusado contesto que el fue quien le habia dado muerte.<\/p>\n<p>La defensa del acusado trato de probar por medio de la declaracion de este y \nvarios testigos, que no fue dicho acusado quien hirio y dio muerte a Clodoaldo \nde Vicente, sino un tal Lamberto Inonog, ya difunto, sobrino del mismo acusado, \ny que lo ocurrido fue que estando de patrulla Raymundo Baldomero con otros \nindividuos con quienes iba tambien Gregorio Inonog el mencionado dia 5 de Enero \nde 1901, al llegar al sitio donde estaba Clodoaldo de Vicente subido a un arbol \nde buri destilando tuba, como dicho individuo estaba alborotando y retando a \ntodos, el Lamberto Inonog le dijo que no hiciera tanto ruido, y que entonces \nClodoaldo de Vicente bajando del arbol en que estaba trato de acometer y dio un \ntajo al Lamberto, por lo que este a su vez evitando el golpe dio otro tajo en el \ncuello al Clodoaldo, causandole una herida que le hizo caer muerto al suelo, \nsiendo de advertir que los mencionados testigos de la defensa no declararon \nacordes en un todo respecto a varios detalles relacionados con el hecho sobre \nque versaron sue respectivas declaraciones, habiendo asimismo declarado otros \ntestigos por la misma defensa para demostrar que la denuncia presentada por \nAgapito Iledan y que dio inicio al procedimiento en esta causa obedecio a \nmoviles politicos, por negarse el acusado a votar en las elecciones conforme a \nlos deseos del Presidente Agapito Iledan.<\/p>\n<p>El Juzgado inferior, despues de practicadas las pruebas en dicha causa, \ndeclaro probado:1. 0 que en o hacia el dia 5 de Enero de 1901 y en la \njurisdiccion del municipio de Malinao, provincia de Capiz, el acusado Gregorio \nInonog se acerco al arbol de buri, donde se encontraba subido Clodoaldo de \nVicente extrayendo tuba, y pidio a dicho Clodoaldo de Vicente que le diera tuba \ny habiendose Clodoaldo negado a la peticion del Gregorio Inonog, este espero que \naquel bajara del arbol, y hallandose Clodoaldo como a una braza de distancia del \nsuelo, le dio un golpe en el costado, lado izquierdo,hacia el abdomen, y al \ncaerse Clodoaldo en el suelo, hallandose de espaldas al Inonog, este volvio a \nasestarle otro tajo con el bolo en el pescuezo, falleciendo el Clodoaldo \ninmediatamente despues a consecuencia de las heridas que recibiera; 2.o que las \ndos heridas inferidas por Gregorio Inonog a Clodoaldo de Vicente causaron la \nmuerte de este, siendo la de la cintura, hacia el abdomen, bastante grande para \nhacer salir los intestinos, y la herida del pescuezo tan grande que la cabeza \ndel herido quedo unida al tronco solamente por un pedazo o sea por la parte de \nla laringe; y 3.o que el motivo de la muerte de Clodoaldo de Vicente fue la \nreclamacion del Gregorio, que se creia con derecho a participar de la tuba, que \nera exclusivamente beneficiado, por aquel y sus hermanos, reclamacion reiterada \nen la fecha 5 de Enero y que al ser negada, fue causa de la muerte violenta de \nClodoaldo de Vicente.<\/p>\n<p>Haciendo el mismo Juzgado la apreciacion de las pruebas practicadas por la \nacusacion y por la defensa dijo en la sentencia lo siguiente: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Las pruebas de la acusacion en esta causa consistieron en \"las declaraciones \nde Feliciana de Vicente y Marta Olluvira, hermana y cu\u00f1ada del occiso y fueron \ntestigos presenciales del hecho de autos; y ademas, los testimonios de Agapito \nLedan, Presidente Municipal de Malinao, Luis Iragana, Sargento de la Policia \nMunicipal en la fecha del suceso, que recibieron y oyeron la confesion del \nacusado, de ser autor de la muerte violenta de Clodoaldo de Vicente,' cuando \neste, detenido y llevado al dia siguiente del suceso ante el cadaver de \nClodoaldo de Vicente, fue preguntado por el Teniente americano, Comandante del \ndestacamento en el Municipio de Malinao, si el era el autor de la muerte de \nClodoaldo de Vicente y el acusado Gregorio Inonog contesto afirmativamente.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Para destruir estas pruebas de la acusacion, la defensa presento el \ntestimonio de seis testigos, ademas del testimonio del propio acusado.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Segun estos testigos presentados por la defensa, Clodoaldo \"de Vicente \nfallecio en la noche de 5 de Enero de 1901, en ocasion en que la ronda del \nbarrio de Bigaa trato de apoderarse del Clodoaldo de Vicente, que subido a un \narbol de buri, estaba escandalizando e insultando a los miembros de la ronda; y \nal bajar Clodoaldo de Vicente del arbol, quiso acometer y agredir a Lamberto \n\"Inonog, sobrino del acusado, viendose el Lamberto obligado a herir y matar con \nsu bolo a Clodoaldo de Vicente en propia defensa.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"El Juzgado no da credito alguno a lo declarado por lo declarado por los \ntestigos de la defensa. Estos testigos, en su actitud, en su manera de declarar \ny en los hechos por ellos relatados, ban demostrado a la Corte que fueron \ninducidos a prestar una declaracion no verdadera y que al venir a declarar en \nesta causa, venian a recitar una leccion que se les hizo aprender de \nmemoria.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Asi ha sucedido con estos testigos, que apenas daban principio a su \ndeclaracion, demostraban tener prisa por declarar lo que sabian o llevaban \naprendido, pues todos ellos hicieron una relacion de hechos, que no eran \ncontestaciones adecuadas a las preguntas que se les dirigian.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Notase ademas en la declaracion de estos testigos el arte con que fueron \npreparados y que era manifiestamente impropio de semejantes testigos, dada su \nescasa o ninguna instruccion, en relacion con los hechos y detalles, por ellos \nrelatados, del suceso que dicen haber presenciado y que ha ocurrido hace \n\"bastante tiempo, mas de 11 a\u00f1os.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Las dos heridas que segun la acusacion, fueron inferidas por el acusado a \nClodoaldo de Vicente y causaron la muerte de este, han sido explicadas de \ndiferente manera por los testigos de la defensa. Mientras unos testigos declaran \nque vieron a Clodoaldo de Vicente en la tarde del 5 de Enero de 1901 herido ya \nen el costado izquierdo, los otros testigos de la defensa nada han declarado \nacerca de esta herida en el costado izquierdo; y el testigo de la defensa \nRaymundo Baldomero, presentado como testigo presencial, declaro que no sabia \ndonde provino la herida del costado izquierdo de Clodoaldo de Vicente.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Aparte esta divergencia, los testigos de la defensa admiten que la herida en \nel cuello de Clodoaldo de Vicente era tan grande, que le cortaba casi todo el \ncuello, dejandole la cabeza solamente unida al cuerpo o tronco en un pedazo \nhacia la larinje.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"La forma de esta herida en el cuello de Clodoaldo de Vicente, que segun los \nmismos testigos de la defensa, era tan grande, que casi corto todo el cuello y \nsolo dejo la cabeza unida al tronco en un pedazo hacia la parte de la larinje, \nes una prueba mas de la falsedad de lo declarado por los testigos de la \ndefensa.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Si, como estos afirman, Lamberto Inonog se vio obligado a herir a \"Clodoaldo \npara defenderse de la acometida de este, debio Lamberto herir a Clodoaldo, \nhallandose frente a este; y en este caso, el cadaver de Clodoaldo debia \npresentar la herida en el cuello, en su parte anterior.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Pero el hecho verdadero y admitido por la defensa es, que el cuello de \nClodoaldo quedo cortado en su parte posterior, demostrando con ello, que el que \nhirio a Clodoaldo de Vicente en e cuello, estaba detras de aquel.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Si fuera verdad lo que declaran los testigos de la defensa, no se concibe \ncomo los siete individuos que componian la ronda y \"que estaban todos armados \ncon bolos y palos, nada hicieron para impedir la muerte de Clodoaldo de Vicente, \nque no tenia mas arma que un bolo, en expresion de los testigos de la defensa. \nMenos se concibe aun, el hecho realizado por estos individuos de la ronda, segun \nla declaracion de los testigos de la defensa, de abandonar el cadaver de \nClodoaldo de Vicente, en cuanto se convencieron de que estaba muerto, despues de \nhaberle inferido Lamberto Inonog la herida en el cuello que casi le separo la \ncabeza del cuerpo.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"La defensa trato tambien de probar, por medio del testigo Jacinto Illesca, \nque la denuncia presentada en esta causa contra el acusado Gregorio Inonog se \ndebio a rivalidades politicas originadas con motivo de las luchas en las pasadas \nelecciones.<\/p>\n<p>\"La acusacion en sus contrapruebas, demostro no ser verdad la existencia de \nla ronda, referida por los testigos de la defensa, y el movil politico atribuido \nal denunciante en esta causa.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"No se ha producido por la defensa prueba alguna que demostrara que los \ntestigos de la acusacion hayan procedido y declarado en esta causa por algun \nmovil legitimo.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"La Corte, despues de considerar detenidamente los testimonios aportados por \namabas partes, cree que los testigos de la acusacion han procedido honradamente \ny han declarado la verdad ante el Juzgado.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Despues de un detenido examen del proceso y de las pruebas practicadas en el \ny del analisis de las varias declaraciones prestadas tanto por los testigos de \nla acusacion, como por los de la defensa, estamos conformes con las \napreciaciones hechas por el Hon. Juez que dicto el fallo recurrido, como \nresultado no solo de la observacion personal, directa e inmediata hecha por el \nde los testigos en el acto de prestar estos su declaracion, sino tambien del \ndetenido estudio de esas mismas declaraciones que revela la critica \nanteriormente expuesta de dichas pruebas para aquilatar la credibilidad de lob \nrespectivos testiroonios de aquellos y demostrar que en el conflicto producido \npor el resultado contradictorio entre la prueba de la acusacion y la de la \ndefensa, la primera demuestra, fuera de duda racional, la verdad de los hechos, \nobjeto del juicio, y la participacion que en la ejecucion de los mismos ha \ntenido el acusado.<\/p>\n<p>No existen, por lo tanto, razones ni motivos que puedan justificar la \nalteracion o modificacion de aquellas apreciaciones y llegamos en su \nconsecuencia a la conclusion de que los hechos que resultan probados en el \njuicio son los que como tales se declaran en la referida sentencia y que han si \ndo mencionados anteriormente.<\/p>\n<p>Es verdad que de la prueba resulta tambien que la denuncia, en virtud de la \ncual se inicio la presente causa, fue presentada por Agapito Iledan, Presidente \nMunicipal del pueblo de Malinao y que lo fue en visperas de elecciones, \nindicandose asimismo que dicho Iledan se hallaba interesado en favor de un \ncandidato que no era e del acusado, pero, ademas de que el citado Iledan ha \nexplicado el motivo por que formulo la mencionada denuncia, atribuyendolo en \ncierta manera al interes de la familia del occiso, que continuaba siendo \nmolestada por el acusado en su pretendido derecho al terreno en que estaba el \narbol de coco en que se hallaba Clodoaldo de Vicente al ser victima de aquella \nagresion por parte del acusado, aun suponiendo cierto que el denunciante hubiera \nsi do movido por algun otro interes que no fuere propia y absolutamente el de la \njusticia para poner en practica lo que el Comandante americano del destacamento \nen el citado pueblo le habia dicho presentando denuncia contra el acusado por el \nhecho criminal perpetrado por este hacia ya muchos a\u00f1os, ello no prueba en \nmanera alguna que no fuera verdad que el acusado perpetro dicho crimen, y si \nsolamente que los que tenian conocimiento de el y especialmente el mismo Agapito \nIledan, que era el Presidente Municipal del pueblo cuando dicho crimen se \nrealizo y a quien el Comandante americano dijo que podia presentarse la denuncia \noportunamente, demoraron el hacerlo aprovechando el Iledan la oportunidad que se \nle ofrecio mas tarde para cumplir con aquel deber, impidiendo asi que quedara \nimpune el autor de dicho delito.<\/p>\n<p>Estando probado que el acusado Gregorio Inonog al inferir a Clodoaldo de \nVicente la primera de las heridas que fueron la causa directa e inmediata de la \nmuerte de este, lo hizo en el mornento en que dicho De Vicente bajaba del arpol \nde coco o buri en que estaba destilando tuba y se hallaba aun a una braza de \ndistancia del suelo, es evidente que en la ejecucion de dicha muerte el referido \nacusado obro con alevosia, pues la forma por el empleada para herir a aquel \ntendio directa y especialmente a asegurar la ejecucion del hecho sin ri esgo \npara su persona que procediera de la defensa que en otro caso hubiera pedi do \nhacer el ofendido, toda vez que, como facilmente se comprende, en las \ncondiciones y en la pesicion en quese hallaba el De Vicente al ser herido por el \nacusado con su lanza, teniendo que hacer uso de sus brazos y manos para \nabrazarse al arbol de coco mientras bajaba del mismo, se veia absolutamente \nimposibilitado de defenderse de la agresion de que era objeto, estando, por lo \ntanto, el acusado libre de todo riesgo

SIXTO SANDEJAS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is a civil action for personal injuries received from a collision with \nthe defendant's automobile due to the negligence of the defendant, <em>who was \ndriving the car.<\/em> The negligence of the defendant is not questioned and this \ncase involves only the amount of damages which should be allowed.\n<p>As a result of the injuries received, plaintiff was obliged to spend ten days \nin the hospital, during the first four or five of which he could not leave his \nbed. After being discharged from the hospital, he received medical attention \nfrom a private practitioner for several days. The latter testified that after \nthe last treatment the plaintiff described himself as being well. On the trial \nthe plaintiff testified that he had done no work since the accident, which \noccurred on July 9, 1912, and that he was not yet entirely recovered. Plaintiff \ntestified that his earning capicity was P50 per month. It is not clear at what \ntime plaintiff became entirely well again, but as the doctor to whom he \ndescribed himself as being well stated that this was about the last of July, and \nthe trial took place September 19, two months' pay would seem sufficient for the \nactual time lost from his work. Plaintiff further testified that he paid the \ndoctor P8 and expended P2 for medicines. This expense, amounting in all to P110, \nshould also be allowed.<\/p>\n<p>Plaintiff sold the products of a distillery on a 10 per cent commission and \nmade an average of P50 per month. He had about twenty regular customers who, it \nseems, purchased in small quantities, necessitating regular and frequent \ndeliveries. Since the accident his wife had done something in a small way to \nkeep up this business but the total orders taken by her would not net them over \nP15. He lost all his regular customers but four, other agents filling their \norders since his accident. It took him about four years to build up the business \nhe had at the time of the accident, and he could not say how long it would take \nhim to get back the business he had lost.<\/p>\n<p>Under this state of facts, the lower court, while recognizing the justness of \nthe claim, refused to allow him anything for injury to his business due to his \nenforced absence there from, on the ground that the doctrine of Marcelo<em> \nvs.<\/em> Velasco (11 Phil. Rep., 277) is opposed to such allowance. The trial \ncourt's opinion appears to be based upon the following quotation from Viada \n(vol. 1, p. 539), quoted in that decision: \"* * * with regard to the offense of \n<em>lesiones,<\/em> for example, the civil liability is almost always limited to \nindemnity for damage to the party aggrieved for the time during which he was \nincapacitated for work; * * *\"<\/p>\n<p>This statement, however, derives its force, not from any provision of the law \napplicable to <em>lesiones,<\/em> but is a mere deduction from the operation of \nthe law upon the cases arising under it. That the interpretation placed upon \nthis statement of Viada by the lower court is either not correct, or that it \ndoes not apply to actions for personal injuries under article 1902 of the Civil \nCode, is apparent from the decisions of the supreme court of Spain of January 8, \n1906, January 15, 1902, and October 19, 1909, to which a more extended reference \nwill be made further on in this opinion. There is nothing said in the decision \nin question prohibiting the allowance of compensatory damages, nor does there \nseem to be anything contained therein opposed to the allowance of such damages \noccurring subsequent to the institution of the action. In fact, it appears from \nthe following quotation that the court would have been disposed to consider \nfavorably the plaintiff's claim for injury to her business had the evidence \npresented it.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"No evidence was then offered by the plaintiff to show that this slight \nlameness in any way interfered with the conduct of her business or that she \ncould make any less amount therein than she could make if she did not suffer \nfrom this defect. The court, therefore, did not err in allowing her no further \ndamages on this account, <em>because there was no evidence that she had suffered \nany.\"<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The alleged damages which the court refused to entertain in that case and \nunder the discussion of which appears the above quotation from Viada, were for \npain and suffering the plaintiff may have experienced. The court said: \"For the \nprofits which the plaintiff failed to obtain, spoken of in the latter part of \nthis article, the plaintiff was allowed to recover, and the question is, whether \nthe value of the loss which she <em>suffered can be extended to pain which she \nexperienced<\/em> by reason of the accident.\" <\/p>\n<p>Actions for damages such as the case at bar are based upon article 1902 of \nthe Civil Code, which reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A person who, by act or omission, causes damage to another when there is \nfault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so \ndone.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Of this article, the supreme court of Spain, in its decision of February 7, \n1900, in considering the indemnity imposed by it, said: \"It is undisputed that \nsaid reparation, to be efficacious and substantial, must rationally include the \ngeneric idea of complete indemnity, such as is defined and explained in article \n1106 of the said (Civil) Code.\"<\/p>\n<p>Articles 1106 and 1107 of the Civil Code read as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"1106. Indemnity for losses and damages includes not only the amount of the \nloss which may have been suffered, but also that of the profit which the \ncreditor may have failed to realize, reserving the provisions contained in the \nfollowing articles.<\/p>\n<p>\"1107. The losses and damages for which a debtor in good faith is liable, are \nthose foreseen or which may have been foreseen, at the time of constituting the \nobligation, and which may be a necessary consequence of its \nnonfulfillment.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\"In case of fraud, the debtor shall be liable for all those which clearly may \noriginate from the nonfulfillment of the obligation.\"<\/p>\n<p>Fraud is not an element of the present case, and we are not therefore \nconcerned with it. The liability of the present defendant includes only those \ndamages which were \"fore-seen or may have been foreseen\" at the time of the \naccident, and which are the necessary and immediate consequences of his fault. \nIn discussing the question of damages under the civil law, Gutierrez (vol. 4, \npp. 64, 65) says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In the impossibility of laying down a surer rule, the Code understands known \ndamages to be those which in the prudent discernment of the judge merit such a \nqualification, although their consequences may not be direct, immediate, \ninevitable.<\/p>\n<p>\"If it is a question of losses occasioned through other causes, except fraud, \nand the contracting parties have not covenanted any indemnity for the case of \nnonfulfillment, then the reparation of the losses or damages shall only comprise \nthose that are the necessary and immediate consequence of that fault. This rule \nmay not be very clear, but is the only one possible in a matter more of the \ndomain of prudence than of law.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In its decision of April 18, 1901, the supreme court of Spain said: \"Neither \nwere the errors incurred that are mentioned in the third assignment, since the \nindemnity for damages is understood to apply to those caused the complainant \ndirectly, and not to those which, indirectly and through more or less logical \ndeductions, may affect the interests of the <em>Ayuntamiento de Viana,<\/em> as \noccurs in the present case where the increase of wealth concerns not only the \n<em>Ayuntamiento<\/em> but also the province and the state, yet, not on this \naccount does any action lie in their behalf as derived from the contracts with \nUrioste.\" <\/p>\n<p>This doctrine is also affirmed in the more recent decision of March 18,1909, \nin the following words: \"For the calculation of the damages claimed, it is \nnecessary, pursuant to the provisions of article 924 of the Law of Civil \nProcedure, to give due regard to the nature of the obligation that was \nunfulfilled and to the reasonable consequences of its non-fulfillment, because \nthe conviction sought can be imposed only when there exists a natural and true \nrelation between such nonfulfillment and the damages, whatever reason there may \nbe to demand them on another account.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Garcia Gamo <em>vs.<\/em> Compania Madrilena de Alumbrado, etc. \n(101 Jurisp., 662), it appeared that an employee of the defendant company whose \nduty it was to clean and light the street lamps left a stepladder leaning \nagainst a tree which stood in a public promenade. The seven-year old son of the \nplaintiff climbed the tree by means of the ladder, and while endeavoring to cut \nsome branches fell to the ground, sustaining severe injuries which eventually \ncaused his death. The plaintiff lost in the lower courts and on appeal to the \nsupreme court the decision of those lower courts was affirmed with the following \nstatement:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That in this sense\u2014aside from the fitness of the judgment appealed from, \ninasmuch as the acquittal of the defendant party resolves all the issues argued \nat the trial, if no counterclaim was made\u2014the assignments of error in the appeal \ncannot be sustained, because, while the act of placing the stepladder against \nthe tree in the manner and for the purposes aforestated, was not permissible it \nwas regularly allowed by the local authorities, and that fact did not precisely \ndetermine the injury, which was due first to the abandonment of the child by his \nparents and secondly to his own imprudence, according to the findings of the \ntrial court, not legally objected to in the appeal; so it is beyond peradventure \nthat the circumstances necessary for imposing the obligations arising from guilt \nor negligence do riot concur in the present case.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The court here simply held that the injury to the child could not be \nconsidered as the probable consequence of an injury which could have been \nforeseen from the act of the company's employee in leaving the ladder leaning \nagainst the tree.<br\/><br\/>In De Alba <em>vs.<\/em> Sociedad Anonima de Tranvias \n(102 Jurisp., 928), a passenger was standing on the platform of a street car \nwhile it was in motion when, on rounding a curve, the plaintiff fell off and \nunder the car, thereby sustaining severe injuries which took several months to \nheal. He was not allowed to recover in the lower courts and on appeal the \nsupreme court sustained the inferior tribunals saying:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Whereas, considering the circumstances of the accident that happened to D. \nAntonio Morales de Alba, such as they were held by the trial court to have been \nproved, the evidence does not disclose that any liability whatever in the said \naccident, for acts or omissions, may be charged against the employees of the \nstreet car, as being guilty through fault or negligence, since it was shown that \nthe car was not traveling at any unusual speed nor was this increased on \nrounding the curve, but that the accident was solely due to the fact that the \ncar in turning made a movement which caused the plaintiff to lose his balance; \nand whereas no act whatever has been proved of any violation of the regulations, \nnor can it be required of street-car employees, who have to attend to their \nrespective duties, that they should foresee and be on the alert to notify the \npossibility of danger when not greater than that which is more or less inherent \nto this mode of travel; therefore the appeal can not be upheld, and with all the \nmore reason since the passenger who takes the risk of travelling on the \nplatform, especially when there is an unoccupied seat in the car, should be on \nhis guard against a contingency so natural as that of losing his balance to a \ngreater or less extent when the car rounds a curve.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In Crespo <em>vs.<\/em> Garcia {112 Jurisp., 796), the plaintiff, a servant \nwoman, 72 years old, was injured in the performance of her duties by the sudden \nand unexpected failure of the upper floor of a house in which she was working. \nThe owner and the architect of the building were made defendants and after due \ntrial it was held that no responsibility attached to them for the failure of the \nfloor, consequently the plaintiff was not allowed to recover. On her appeal to \nthe supreme court that tribunal said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Whereas the trial court held, in view of all the evidence adduced, including \nthe expert and other testimony, that the act which occasioned the injury \nsuffered by Dona Maria Alonso Crespo, was accidental, without fault of anybody, \nand consequently fortuitous, and that, in so considering it to absolve the \ndefendants, he did not incur the second error assigned on the appeal, because, \nwithout overlooking the import and legal value of the affidavit adduced at the \ntrial, he held that the defendants in their conduct were not liable for any \nomission that might constitute such fault or negligence as would oblige them to \nindemnify the plaintiff; and to support the error assigned no legal provision \nwhatever was cited such as would require a different finding, nor was any other \nauthentic document produced than the aforesaid affidavit which contained an \naccount of the ocular inspection and the expert's report, which, as well as the \ntestimony of the witnesses, the trial court was able to pass upon in accordance \nwith its exclusive power\u2014all points of proof which do not reveal any mistake on \nthe part of the judge, whose opinion the appellant would substitute with his own \nby a different interpretation.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>These authorities are sufficient to show that liability for acts <em>ex \ndelicto<\/em> under the Civil Code is precisely that embraced within the \n\"proximate cause\" of the Anglo-Saxon law of torts.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The general rule, as frequently stated, is that in order that an act or \nomission may be the proximate cause of an injury, the injury must be the natural \nand probable consequence of the act or omission and such as might have been \nforeseen by an ordinarily responsible and prudent man, in the light of the \nattendant circumstances, as likely to result therefrom * * *<\/p>\n<p>\"According to the later authorities foreseeableness, as an element of \nproximate cause, does not depend upon whether an ordinarily reasonable and \nprudent man would or ought in advance to have anticipated the result which \nhappened, but whether, if such result and the chain of events connecting it with \nthe act complained of had occurred to his mind, the same would have seemed \nnatural and probable and according to the ordinary course of nature. Thus, as \nsaid in one case, 'A person guilty of negligence, or an unlawful act, should be \nheld responsible for all the consequences which a prudent and experienced man, \nfully acquainted with all the circumstances which in fact existed, would at the \ntime of the negligent or unlawful act have thought reasonable to follow, if they \nhad occurred to his mind.' (Wabash R. etc. Co. <em>vs.<\/em> Coker, 81 Ill. App. \n660, 664; Cooley on Torts, sec. 15.)\"<\/p>\n<p>\"The view which I shall endeavor to justify is that, for the purpose of civil \nliability, those consequences, and those only, are deemed 'immediate,' \n'proximate,' or, to anticipate a little, 'natural and probable,' which a person \nof average competence and knowledge, being in the like case with the person \nwhose conduct is complained of, and having the like opportunities of \nobservation, might be expected to foresee as likely to follow upon such conduct. \nThis is only where the particular consequence is not known to have been intended \nor foreseen by the actor. If proof of that be forth coming, whether the \nconsequence was 'immediate' or not does not matter. That which a man actually \nforesees is to him, at all events, natural and probable.\" (Webb's Pollock on \nTorts, p. 32.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There is another line Of definitions which have for their basis \"the natural \nand probable consequences\" or \"the direct and immediate consequences\" of the \ndefendant's act. (Joyce on Damages, sec. 82.)<\/p>\n<p>It will be observed that the supreme court of Spain, in the above decisions, \nhas rather inclined to this line of definitions of what results a defendant is \nliable for as a consequence of his wrongful acts, while the Civil Code uses the \nphraseology, \"those foreseen or which may have been foreseen.\" From either \nviewpoint the method of arriving at the liability of the wrongdoer under the \nCivil Code and under the Anglo Saxon law is the same. Such was the holding of \nthis court in Taylor <em>vs.<\/em> M. E. R. &amp; L. Co. (16 Phil. Rep., 8, \n15):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We agree with counsel for appellant that under the Civil Code, as under the \ngenerally accepted doctrine in the United States, the plaintiff in an action \nsuch as that under consideration, in order to establish his right to a recovery, \nmust establish by competent evidence:<\/p>\n<p>\"(1) Damages to the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>\"(2) Negligence by act or omission of which defendant personally, or some \nperson for whose acts it must respond, was guilty.<\/p>\n<p>\" (3) The connection of cause and effect between the negligence and the \ndamages.<\/p>\n<p>\"These propositions are, of course, elementary, and do not admit of \ndiscussion, the real difficulty arising in the application of these principles \nto the particular facts developed in the case under \nconsideration.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Parenthetically it may be said that we are not now dealing with the doctrine \nof comparative (contributory) negligence which was established by Rakes \n<em>vs.<\/em> A. G. &amp; P. Co. (7 Phil. Rep., 359), and Eades <em>vs.<\/em> A. \nG. &amp; P. Co. (19 Phil. Rep., 561.)<\/p>\n<p>The rules for the <em>measure of damages,<\/em> once that liability is \ndetermined, are, however, somewhat different. The Civil Code requires that the \ndefendant repair the damage caused by his fault or negligence. No distinction is \nmade therein between damage caused maliciously and intentionally and damages \ncaused through mere negligence in so far as the civil liability of the wrongdoer \nis concerned. Nor is the defendant required to do more than repair the damage \ndone, or, in other words, to put the plaintiff in the same position, so far as \npecuniary compensation can do so, that he would have been in had the damage not \nbeen inflicted. In this respect there is a notable difference between the two \nsystems.<\/p>\n<p>Under the Anglo-Saxon law, when malicious or willful intention to cause the \ndamage is an element of the defendant's act, it is quite generally regarded as \nan aggravating circumstance for which the plaintiff is entitled to more than \nmere compensation for the inj ury inflicted. These are called exemplary or \npunitive damages, and no provision is made for them in article 1902 of the Civil \nCode.<\/p>\n<p>Again, it is quite common under the English system to award what is called \nnominal damages where there is only a technical violation of the plaintiff's \nrights resulting in no substantial injury to him. This branch of damages is also \nunknown under the Civil Code. If no damages have actually occurred there can be \nnone to repair and the doctrine of nominal damages 1s not applicable. Thus it \nhas been often held by the supreme court of Spain that a mere noncompliance with \nthe obligations of a contract is not sufficient to sustain a judgment for \ndamage's. It must be shown that damages actually existed. (Decision of February \n10,1904.)<\/p>\n<p>Again, in its decision of January 9, 1897, that high tribunal said that as a \nlogical consequence of the requirements of articles 1101, 1718, and 1902 that he \nwho causes damages must repair them, their existence must be proved.<\/p>\n<p>In at least one case decided by this court we held in effect that \nnominal-damages could not be allowed. (Mercado <em>vs.<\/em> Abangan, 10 Phil. \nRep., 676.)<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The purpose of the law in awarding actual damages is to repair the wrong \nthat has been done, to compensate for the injury inflicted, and not to impose a \npenalty. Actual damages are not dependent on nor graded by the intent with which \nthe wrongful act is done.\" (Field <em>vs.<\/em> Munster, 11 Tex. Civ. Appl., 341, \n32 S. W., 417.) \"The words 'actual damages' shall be construed to include all \ndamages that the plaintiff may show he has suffered in respect to his property, \nbusiness, trade, profession, or occupation, and no other damages whatever.\" \n(Gen. Stat. Minn., 1894, sec. 5418.) \"Actual damages are compensatory only.\" \n(Lord, Owen &amp; Co. vs. Wood, 120 Iowa, 303, 94 N. W., 842.) \" 'Compensatory \ndamages' as indicated by the word employed to characterize them, simply make \ngood or replace the loss caused by the wrong. They proceed from a sense of \nnatural justice, and are designed to repair that of which one has been deprived \nby the wrong of another.\" (Reid <em>vs.<\/em> Ter williger, 116 N. Y., 530; 22 N. \nE., 1091.) \" 'Compensatory damages' are such as are awarded to compensate the \ninjured party for injury caused by the wrong, and must be only such as make just \nand fair compensation, and are due when the wrong is established, whether it was \ncommitted maliciously\u2014that is, with evil intention\u2014or not.\" (Wimer <em>vs.<\/em> \nAllbaugh, 78 Iowa, 79; 42 N. W., 587; 16 Am. St. Rep., 422.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Finally, this court has itself held that actual damages are the extent of the \nrecovery allowed to the plaintiff. In Marker <em>vs.<\/em> Garcia (5 Phil. Rep., \n557), which was an action for damages for breach of contract, this court said: \n\"Except in those cases where the law authorizes the imposition of punitive or \nexemplary damages, the party claiming damages must establish by competent \nevidence the amount of such damages, and <em>courts can not give judgment for a \ngreater amount than those actually proven.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the requirements of article 1902, that the \ndefendant repair the damage done can only mean what is set forth in the above \ndefinitions. Anything short of that would not repair the damages and anything \nbeyond that would be excessive. Actual compensatory damages are those allowed \nfor tortious wrongs under the Civil Code; nothing more, nothing less.<\/p>\n<p>According to the text of article 1106 of the Civil Code, which, according to \nthe decision of February 7, 1900 (referred to above), is the generic conception \nof what article 1902 embraces, actual damages include not only loss already \nsuffered, but loss of profits which may not have been realized. The allowance of \nloss of prospective profits could hardly be more explicitly provided for. But it \nmay may not be amiss to refer to the decisions of the supreme court of Spain for \nits interpretation of this article. The decisions are numerous upon this point. \nThe decision of February 12, 1896, as epitomized by Sanchez Roman (vol. 1, p. \n281), interprets article 1106 as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Pursuant to articles 1106 and 1107 of the same Code, which govern in general \nthe matter of indemnity due for the nonfulfillment of obligations, the indemnity \ncomprises, not only the value of the loss suffered, but also that of the \nprospective profit that was not realized, and the obligation of the debtor in \ngood faith is limited to such losses and damages as were foreseen or might have \nbeen foreseen at the time the obligation was incurred and which are a necessary \nconsequence of his failure of fulfillment. Losses and damages under such \nlimitations and frustrated profits must, therefore, be proved directly by means \nof the evidence the law authorizes.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The decision of January 8, 1906 (published in 14 Jurisp. del C6digo Civil, \n516) had to do with the following case: The plaintiff, a painter by occupation; \nwas engaged to paint the poles from which were suspended the trolley wires of a \ntraction company. While at work on February 8, 1901, the electric current was \nnegligently turned on by the company, whereby plaintiff received a severe shock, \ncausing him to fall to the ground. Plaintiff sustained severe injuries which \ntook several months to heal and his right arm was permanently disabled by the \naccident. The age of the plaintiff is not stated. His daily wage was four \n<em>pesetas. <\/em>He was awarded 25,000 <em>pesetas<\/em> by the trial court and \nthis judgment was affirmed on appeal to the supreme court. This was equivalent \nto approximately twenty years' salary. In its decision of January 15, 1902 \n(published in 10 Jurisp. del Codigo Civil, 260), the supreme court had the \nfollowing case under consideration: Plaintiff's son was a travelling salesman 48 \nyears of age, who received an annual salary of 2,500 pesetas and expenses. While \ntravelling on defendant's train an accident occurred which caused his death. The \naccident was held to be due to the failure of the defendant company to keep its \ntrack and roadbed in good repair. Plaintiff was allowed 35,000 <em>pesetas<\/em> \nfor the death of her son. This would be equivalent to about fourteen years' \nsalary.<\/p>\n<p>In the case dated October 19, 1909 (published in 116 Jurisp. del Codigo \nCivil, 120), plaintiff was suing for the death of his son caused from injuries \ninflicted by the defendant's bull while plaintiff and his son were travelling \nalong a public road. The age of the son is not given. Plaintiff was awarded \n3,000 <em>pesetas<\/em> damages.<\/p>\n<p>In each of the above-mentioned cases the supreme court refused to pass on the \namount of damages which had been awarded. It appears to be the unvarying rule of \nthe supreme court of Spain to accept the amount of damages awarded by trial \ncourts, its only inquiry being as to whether damages have actually occurred as \nthe result of the defendant's fault or negligence. (Decision of July 5, 1909.) \nThe reason why the supreme court of Spain refuses to consider the amount of \ndamages awarded is to be found in the great importance attached by it to the \nprovisions of the <em>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil,<\/em> articles 659 and 1692, \nNo. 7. In its auto of March. 16, 1900 (published in 8 Jurisp. del Codigo Civil, \n503), the following comment is made on these articles:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"As this supreme court has repeatedly held, the weight given by the trial \njudge to the testimony, with good discernment or otherwise, can not be a matter \nfor reversal, not even with the support of No. 7 of article 1692 of the <em>Ley \nde Enjuiciamiento Civil,<\/em> as it is exclusively submitted to him, pursuant to \nthe provisions of article 659 of the said law and article 1248 of the \nCode.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The practice of this court, under our Code of Civil Procedure, does not \npermit of our going to such lengths in sustaining the findings of fact in trial \ncourts. We have repeatedly held that due weight will be given in this court to \nthe findings of fact by trial courts by reason of their opportunities to see and \nhear the witnesses testify, note their demeanor and bearing upon the stand, \netc., but when the decision of the trial court, after permitting due allowance \nfor its superior advantages in weighing the evidence of the case, appears to us \nto be against the fair preponderance of that evidence, it is our duty to reverse \nor set aside the findings of fact made by the trial court and render such \njudgment as the facts of the same seem to us to warrant. (Code Civ. Proc, sec. \n496.) We need go to no other branch of law than that of damages to support this \nstatement. In the following cases the damages awarded by the lower court were \nreduced after a consideration of the evidece: Sparrevohn <em>vs.<\/em> Fisher (2 \nPhil. Rep., 676); Campbell &amp; Go-Tauco <em>vs.<\/em> Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. (3 \nPhil. Rep., 590); Causin <em>vs.<\/em> Jakosalem (5. Phil. Rep., 155) ; Marker \n<em>vs.<\/em> Garcia (5 Phil. Rep., 557); Uy Piapco <em>vs.<\/em> Osme\u00f1a (9 Phil. \nRep., 299); Macleod <em>vs.<\/em> Phil. Pub. Co. (12 Phil. Rep., 427); Orense<em> \nvs.<\/em> Jaucian (18 Phil. Rep., 553). In Rodriguez <em>vs.<\/em> Findlay &amp; \nCo. (14 Phil. Rep., 294); and Cordoba y Conde <em>vs. <\/em>Castle Bros. (18 \nPhil. Rep., 317), the damages awarded by the lower court were increased on \nappeal after a consideration of the evidence. In Brodek <em>vs.<\/em> Larson (8 \nPhil. Rep., 425), it was held that the damages awarded by the lower court were \nbased on too uncertain evidence, and the case was remanded for a new trial as to \nthe amount of damages sustained. Also in Saldivar <em>vs.<\/em> Municipality of \nTalisay (18 Phil. Rep., 362), where the lower court exonerated the defendant \nfrom liability, this court, after a consideration of the evidence, held that the \ndefendant was liable and remanded the case for the purpose of a new trial in \norder to ascertain the amount of damages sustained.<br\/><br\/>In this respect the \nlaw of damages under article 1902, as laid down by the decisions of the supreme \ncourt of Spain, has been indirectly modified by the present Code of Civil \nProcedure so that the finding of the lower court as to the amount of damages is \nnot conclusive on appeal.<\/p>\n<p>Actual damages, under the American system, include pecuniary recompense for \npain and suffering, injured feelings, and the like. Article 1902, as interpreted \nby this court in Marcelo<em> vs.<\/em> Velasco (11 Phil. Rep., 287), does not \nextend to such incidents. Aside from this exception, actual damages, in this \njurisdiction, in the sense that they mean just compensation for the loss \nsuffered, are practically synonymous with actual damages under the American \nsystem.<\/p>\n<p>This court has already gone some distance in incorporating into our \njurisprudence those principles of the American law of actual damages which are \nof a general and abstract nature. In Baer Senior &amp; Co.'s Successors \n<em>vs.<\/em> Compania Maritima (6 Phil. Rep., 215), the American principle of \nadmiralty law that the liability of the ship for a tow is not so great as that \nfor her cargo was applied in determining the responsibility of a ship, under the \nCode of Commerce, for her tow. In Rodriguez<em> vs.<\/em> Findlay &amp; Co. (14 \nPhil. Rep., 294), which was an action for breach of contract of warranty* the \nfollowing principle, supported entirely by American authority. Was used in \ncomputing the amount of damages due the plaintiff:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The damages recoverable of a manufacturer or dealer for the breach of \nwarranty of machinery; which he contracts to furnish, or place in operation for \na known purpose are not confined to the difference in value of the machinery as \nwarranted and as it proves to be, but includes such consequential damages as are \nthe direct, immediate, and probable result of the breach.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In Aldaz <em>vs.<\/em> Gay (7 Phil. Rep., 268), it was held that the earnings \nor possible earnings of a workman wrongfully discharged should be considered in \nmitigation of his damages for the breach of contract by his employer, with the \nremark that nothing had been brought to our attention to the contrary under \nSpanish jurisprudence.<\/p>\n<p>In Fernandez <em>vs.<\/em> M. E. R. &amp; L. Co. (14 Phil. Rep., 274), a \nrelease or compromise for personal injury sustained by negligence attributed to \nthe defendant company was held a bar to an action for the recovery of further \ndamages, on the strength of American precedents.<\/p>\n<p>In Taylor vs. M. E. R. &amp; L. Co., supra, in the course of an extended \nreference to American case law, the doctrine of the so-called \"Turntable\" and \n\"Torpedo\" cases was adopted by this court as a factor in determining the \nquestion of liability for damages in such cases as the one the court then had \nunder consideration.<\/p>\n<p>In Martinez <em>vs.<\/em> Van Buskirk (18 Phil. Rep., 79), this court, after \nremarking that the rules under the Spanish law by which the fact of negligence \nis determined are, generally speaking, the same as they are in Anglo-Saxon \ncountries, approved the following well-known rule of the Anglo Saxon law of \nnegligence, relying exclusively upon American authorities: \"* * * acts, the \nperformance of which has not proven destructive or injurious and which have been \ngenerally acquiesced in by society for so long a time as to have ripened into a \ncustom, cannot be held to be unreasonable or imprudent and that, under the \ncircumstances, the driver was not guilty of negligence in so leaving his team \nwhile assisting in unloading his wagon.\"<\/p>\n<p>This court does not, as a rule, content itself in the determination of cases \nbrought before it, with a mere reference to or quotation of the articles of the \ncodes or laws applicable to the questions involved, for the reason that it is \ncommitted to the practice of citing precedents for its rulings wherever \npracticable. (See Ocampo <em>vs.<\/em> Cabangis, 15 Phil. Rep., 626.) No better \nexample of the necessity of amplifying this treatment of a subject given in the \ncode is afforded than article 1902 of the Civil Code, That article requires that \nthe defendant repair the damage done. There is, however, a world of difficulty \nin carrying out the legislative will in this particular. The measure of damages \nis an ultimate fact, to be determined from the evidence submitted to the court. \nThe question is sometimes a nice one to determine, whether the offered evidence \nis such as ought to be considered by the \u00abcourt ir fixing the quantum of \ndamages; and while the complexity of human affairs is such that two cases are \nseldom exactly alike, a thorough discussion of each case may permit of their \nmore or less definite classification, and develop leading principles which will \nbe of great assistance to a court in determining the question, not only of \ndamages, but of the prior one of negligence. We are of the opinion that as the \nCode is so indefinite (even though from necessity) on the subject of damages \narising from fault or negligence, the bench and bar should have access to and \navail themselves of those great, underlying principles which have been gradually \nand conservatively developed and thoroughly tested in Anglo-Saxon courts. A \ncareful and intelligent application of these principles should have a tendency \nto prevent mistakes in the rulings of the court on the evidence offered, and \nshould assist in determining damages, generally, with some degree of \nuniformity.<\/p>\n<p>The law of damages has not, for some reason, proved as favorite a theme with \nthe civil-law writers as with those of the common-law school. The decisions of \nthe supreme court of Spain, though numerous on damages arising from contractual \nobligations, are exceedingly few upon damages for personal injuries arising \n<em>ex delicto.<\/em> The reasons for this are not important to the present \ndiscussion. It is sufficient to say that the Jaw of damages has not received the \nelaborate treatment that it has at the hands of the Anglo Saxon jurists. If we \nin this jurisdiction desire to base our conclusions in damage cases upon \ncontrolling principles, we may develop those principles and incorporate them \ninto our jurisprudence by that difficult and tedious process which constitutes \nthe centuries-old history of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence; or we may avail \nourselves of these principles in their present sikte of development without \nfurther effort than it costs to refer to the works and writings of many eminent \ntext-writers and jurists. We shall not attempt to say that all these principles \nwill be applicable in this jurisdiction. It must be constantly borne in mind \nthat the law of damages in this jurisdiction was conceived in the womb of the \ncivil law and under an entirely different form of government. These influences \nhave had their effect upon the customs and institutions of the country. Nor are \nthe industrial and social conditions the same. An act which might constitute \nnegligence or damage there might not constitute negligence or damage here, and \nvice versa. As stated in Story on Bailments, section 12, \"It will thence follow \nthat, in different times and in different countries, the standard (of diligence) \nis necessary variable with respect to the facts, although it may be uniform with \nrespect to the principle. So that it may happen that the same acts which in one \ncountry or in one age may be deemed negligent acts, may at another time or in \nanother country be justly deemed an exercise of ordinary diligence.\"<\/p>\n<p>The abstract rules for determining negligence and the measure of damages are, \nhowever, rules of natural justice rather than man-made law, and are applicable \nunder any enlightened system of jurisprudence. There is all the more reason for \nour adopting the abstract principles of the Anglo Saxon law of damages, when we \nconsider that there are at least two important laws on our statute books of \nAmerican origin, in the application of which we must necessarily be guided by \nAmerican authorities: they are the Libel Law (which, by the way, allows damages \nfor injured feelings and reputation, as well as punitive damages, in a proper \ncase), and the Employers' Liability Act.<\/p>\n<p>The case at bar involves actual incapacity of the plaintiff for two months, \nand loss of the greater portion of his business. As to the damages resulting \nfrom the actual incapacity of the plaintiff to attend to his business there is \nno question. They are, of course, to be allowed on the basis of his earning \ncapacity, which in this case, is P50 per month. The difficult question in the \npresent case is to determine the damage which has resulted to his business \nthrough his enforced absence. In Sanz<em> vs.<\/em> Lavin Bros. (6 Phil. Rep., \n299), this court, citing numerous decisions of the supreme court of Spain, held \nthat evidence of damages \"must rest upon satisfactory proof of the existence in \nreality of the damages alleged to have been suffered.\" But, while certainty is \nan essential element of an award of damages, it need not be a mathematical \ncertainty. That this is true is adduced not only from the personal injury cases \nfrom the supreme court of Spain which we have discussed above, but by many cases \ndecided by this court, reference to which has already been made. As stated in \nJoyce on Damages, section 75, \"But to deny the injured party the right to \nrecover any actual damages in cases of torts because they are of such a nature \nas cannot be thus certainly measured, would be to enable parties to profit by \nand speculate upon their own wrongs; such is not the law.\"<\/p>\n<p>As to the elements to be considered in estimating the damage done to \nplaintiff's business by reason of his accident, this same author, citing \nnumerous authorities, has the following to say: \"It is proper to consider the \nbusiness the plaintiff is engaged in, the nature and extent of such business, \nthe importance of his personal oversight and superintendence in conducting it, \nand the consequent loss arising from his inability to prosecute it.\"<\/p>\n<p>The business of the present plaintiff required his immediate supervision. All \nthe profits derived therefrom were wholly due to his own exertions. Nor are his \ndamages confined to the actual time during which he was physically incapacitated \nfor work, as is the case of a person working for a stipulated daily or monthly \nor yearly salary. As to persons whose labor is thus compensated and who \ncompletely recover from their injuries, the rule may be said to be that their \ndamages are confined to the duration of their enforced absence from their \noccupation. But the present plaintiff could not resume his work at the same \nprofit he was making when the accident occurred. He had built up an established \nbusiness which included some twenty regular customers. These customers \nrepresented to him a regular income. In addition to this he made sales to other \npeople who were not so regular in their purchases. But he could figure on making \nat least some sales each month to others besides his regular customers. Taken as \na whole his average monthly income from his business was about P50. As a result \nof the accident, he lost all but four of his regular customers and his receipts \ndwindled down to practically nothing. Other agents had invaded his territory, \nand upon becoming physically able to attend to his business, he found that it \nwould be necessary to start with practically no regular trade, and either win \nback his old customers from his competitors or else secure others. During this \nprocess of reestablishing his patronage his income would necessarily be less \nthan he was making at the time of the accident and would continue to be so for \nsome time. Of course, if it could be mathematically determined how much less he \nwill earn during this rebuilding process than he would have earned if the \naccident had not occurred, that would be the amount he would be entitled to in \nthis action. But manifestly this ideal compensation cannot be ascertained. The \nquestion therefore resolves itself into whether this damage to his business can \nbe so nearly ascertained as to justify a court in awarding any amount \nwhatever.<br\/><br\/>When it is shown that a plaintiff's business is a going 1 \nconcern with a fairly steady average profit on the investment, it may be assumed \nthat had the interruption to the business through defendant's wrongful act not \noccurred, it would have continued producing this average income \"so long as is \nusual with things of that nature.\" When in addition to the previous average \nincome of the business it is further shown what the reduced receipts of the \nbusiness; are immediately after the cause of the interruption has been removed, \nthere can be no manner of doubt that a loss of profits has resulted from the \nwrongful act of the defendant. In the present case, we not only have the value \nof plaintiff's business to him just prior to the accident, but we also have its \nvalue to him after the accident. At the trial, he testified that his wife had \nearned about fifteen pesos during the two months that he was disabled. That this \nalmost total destruction of his business was directly chargeable to defendant's \nwrongful act, there can be no manner of doubt; and the mere fact that the loss \ncan not be ascertained with absolute accuracy, is no reason for denying \nplaintiff's claim altogether. As stated in one case, it would be a reproach to \nthe law if he could not recover damages at all. (Baldwin <em>vs.<\/em> Marqueze, \n91 Ga., 404.)<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Profits are not excluded from recovery because they are profits; but when \nexcluded, it is on the ground that there are no <em>criteria<\/em> by which to \nestimate the amount with the certainty on which the adjudications of courts, and \nthe findings of juries should be based.\" (Brigham <em>vs.<\/em> Carlisle (Ala.), \n56 Am. Rep., 28, as quoted in Wilson <em>vs.<\/em> Wernwag, 217 Pa., \n82.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The leading English case on the subject is Phillips <em>vs.<\/em> London &amp; \nSouthwestern Ry. Co. (5 Q. B. D., 78; 41 L. T., 121; 8 Eng. Rul. Cases, 447). \nThe plaintiff was a physician with a very lucrative practice. In one case he had \nreceived a fee of 5,000 guineas; but it appeared that his average income was \nbetween 6,000 and 7,000 pounds sterling per year. The report does not state \ndefinitely how serious plaintiff's injuries were, but apparently he was \npermanently disabled. The following instruction to the jury was approved, and we \nthink should be set out in this opinion as applicable to the present case:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"You cannot put the plaintiff back again into his original position, but you \nmust bring your reasonable common sense to bear, and you must always recollect \nthat this is the only occasion on which compensation can be given. Dr. Phillips \ncan never sue again for it. You have, therefore, now to give him compensation, \nonce for all. He has done no wrong; he has suffered a wrong at the hands of the \ndefendants; and and you must take care, to give him full, fair compensation for \nthat which he has suffered.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The jury's award was seven thousand pounds. Upon a new trial, on the ground \nof the insufficiency of the damages awarded, plaintiff received 16,000 pounds. \nOn the second appeal, Bramwell, L. J., put the case of a laborer earning 25 \nshillings a week, who, on account of injury, was totally incapacitated for work \nfor twenty-six weeks, and then for ten weeks could not earn more than ten \nshillings a week, and was not likely to get into full work for another twenty \nweeks. The proper measure of damages would be in that case 25 shillings a week \nfor twenty-six, weeks, plus 15 shillings a week for the ten: and twenty weeks, \nand damages for bodily suffering and medical expenses. Damages for bodily \nsuffering, of course, are not, for reasons stated above, applicable to this \njurisdiction; otherwise, we believe this example to be the ideal compensation \nfor loss of profits which courts should strive to reach, in cases like the \npresent.<\/p>\n<p>In Joslin <em>vs.<\/em> Grand Rapids Ice &amp; Coal Co. (53 Mich., 322), the \ncourt said: \"The plaintiff, in making proof of his damages, offered testimony to \nthe effect that he was an attorney at law of ability and in good standing, arid \nthe extent and value of his practice, and that, in; substance; the injury had \nrendered him incapable of pursuit his profession. This was objected to as \nirrelevant, immaterial arid incompetent We think this was competent. It was \nwithin the declaration that his standing in his profession was such as to \ncommand respect, and was proper to be shown, and his ability to earn, and the \nextent of his practice, were a portion of the loss he had sustained by the \ninjury complied of. There was no error in permitting this proof, and we further \nthink it was competent, upon the question of damages under the evidence in this \ncase, for the plaintiff to show, by Judge Hoyt, as was done, that an \ninterruption in his legal business and practice for eight months was a damage to \nhim. It seems to have been a part of the legitimate consequences of the \nplaintiff's injury.\"<\/p>\n<p>In Luck <em>vs.<\/em> City of Ripon (52 Wis., 196), plaintiff was allowed to \nprove that she was a midwife and show the extent of her earnings prior to the \naccident in order to establish the damage done to her business.<\/p>\n<p>The pioneer case of Goebel <em>vs.<\/em> Hough (26 Minn., 292) contains \nperhiaps one of the clearest statements of the rule and is generally considered \nas one of the leading cases on this subject. In that case the court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When a regular and established business, the value of which may be \nascertained, has been wrongfully interrupted, the true general rule for \ncompensating the party injured is to ascertain how much less valuable the \nbusiness was by reason of the interruption, and allow that as damages. This \ngives him only what the wrongful act deprived him of. The value of such a \nbusiness depends mainly on the ordinary profits derived from it. Such value \ncannot be ascertained without showing what the usual profits are; nor are the \nordinary profits incident to such a business contingent or speculative, in the \nsense that excludes profits from consideration as an element of damages. What \nthey would have been, in the ordinary course of the business, for a period \nduring which it was interrupted, may be shown with reasonable certainty. What \neffect extraordinary circumstances would have had upon the business might be \ncontingent and conjectural, and any profits anticipated from such causes would \nbe obnoxious to the objection that they are merely speculative; but a historyf \nthe business, for a reasonable time prior to a period of interruption, would be \ndone under ordinary circumstances, and in the usual course, during the given \nperiod; and the usual rate of profit being shown, of course the aggregate \nbecomes only a matter of calculation.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the very recent case of Wellington <em>vs.<\/em> Spencer (Okla., 132 S. W., \n675), plaintiff had rented a building from the defendant and used it as a hotel. \nDefendant sued out a wrongful writ of attachment upon the equipment of the \nplaintiff, which caused him to abandon his hotel business. After remarking that \nthe earlier cases held that no recovery could be had for prospective profits, \nbut that the later authorities have held that such damages may be allowed when \nthe amount is capable of proof, the court had the following to say:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Where the plaintiff has just made his arrangements to begin business, and he \nis prevented from beginning either by tort or a breach of contract, or where the \ninjury is to a particular subject matter, profits of which are uncertain, \nevidence as to expected profits must be excluded from the jury because of the \nuncertainty. There is as much reason to believe that there will be no profits as \nto believe that there will be profits, but no such argument can be made against \nproving a usual profit of an established business. In this case the plaintiff, \naccording to his testimony, had an established business, and was earning a \nprofit in the business, and had been doing that for a sufficient length of time \nthat evidence as to prospective profits was not entirely speculative. Men who \nhave been engaged in business calculate with a reasonable certainty the income \nfrom their business, make their plans to live accordingly, and the value of such \nbusiness is not such a matter of speculation as to exclude evidence from the \njury.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A good example of a business not established for which loss of profits will \nnot be allowed may be found in States vs. Durkin (65 Kan., 101). Plaintiffs \nformed a partnership.and entered the plumbing business in the city of Topeka in \nApril. In July of the same year, they brought an action against a plumbers' \nassociation on the ground that the latter had formed an unlawful combination in \nrestraint of trade and prevented them from securing supplies for their business \nwithin a reasonable time. The court said;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In the present case the plaintiffs had only been in business a short \ntime\u2014not so long that it can be said that they had an established business. They \nhad contracted three jobs of plumbing, had finished two, and lost money on both; \nnot, however, because of any misconduct or wrongful acts on the part of the \ndefendants or either of them. They carried no stock in trade, and their manner \nof doing business was to secure a contract and then purchase the material \nnecessary for its completion. It is not shown that they had any means or capital \ninvested in the business other than their tools. Neither of them had prior \nthereto managed or carried on a similar business. Nor was it shown that they \nwere capable of so managing this business as to make it earn a profit. There was \nlittle of that class of business being done at that time, and little, if any, \nprofit derived therefrom. The plaintiffs' business lacked duration, permanency, \nand recognition. It was an adventure, as distinguished from an established \nbusiness. It was an adventure, as distinguished from an established business. \nIts profits were speculative and remote, existing only in anticipation. The law, \nwith all its vigor and energy in its effort to right wrongs and award damages \nfor injuries sustained, may not enter into the domain of speculation or \nconjecture. In view of the character and condition of the plaintiffs' business, \nthe jury had not sufficient evidence from which to ascertain \nprofits.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Other cases which hold that the profits of an established business may be \nconsidered in calculating the measure of damages for an interruption of it are: \nWilkinson <em>vs<\/em>. Dunbar (149 N. C, 20); Kinney <em>vs.<\/em> Crocker (18 \nWis., 80); Sachra <em>vs.<\/em> Manilla (120 Ia., 562); Kramer <em>vs.<\/em> City \nof Los Angeles (147 Cal., 668); Mugge <em>vs.<\/em> Erkman (161 Ill.

(95 Me., \n318); Sutherland on Damages,sec. 70.<\/p>\n<p>We have now outlined the principles which should govern the measure of \ndamages in this case. We are of the opinion that the lower court had before it \nsufficient evidence of the damage to plaintiff's business in the way of \nprospective loss of profits to justify it in calculating his damages as to this \nitem. That evidence has been properly elevated to this court for review. Under \nsection 496 of the Code of Civil Procedure, we are authorized to enter final \njudgment or direct a new trial, as may best subserve the ends of justice. We are \nof the opinion that the evidence presented as to the damage done to plaintiff's \nbusiness is credible and that it is sufficient and clear enough upon which to \nbase a judgment for damages. Plaintiff having had four years' experience in \nselling goods on commission, it must be presumed that he will be able to rebuild \nhis business to its former proportions; so that at some time in the future his \ncommissions will equal those he was receiving when the accident occurred. Aided \nby his experience, he should be able to rebuild this business to its former \nproportions in much less time than it took to establish it as it stood just \nprior to the accident. One year should be sufficient time in which to do this. \nThe profits which plaintiff will receive from the business in the course of its \nreconstruction will gradually increase. The injury to plaitiff's business begins \nwhere these profits leave off, and, as a corollary, there is where defendant's \nliability begins. Upon this basis, we fix the damages to plaintiff's business at \nP250.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the lower court is set aside, and the plaintiff is awarded \nthe following damages: ten pesos for medical expenses; one hundred pesos for the \ntwo months of his enforced absence from his business; and two hundred and fifty \npesos for the damage done to his business in the way of loss of profits, or a \ntotal of three hundred and sixty pesos. No costs will be allowed in this \ninstance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, J., <\/em>concur.<\/p>\n<p><em>Carson, J.,<\/em> concurs in the result<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/div>",

He \ntold the court that that was the third time he had been convicted of the same \noffense.<\/p>\n<p>Appellant's counsel states: \"The accused has been accorded a fair trial, but \nwe believe that the court has erred in sentencing him to serve a term of \nimprisonment.

It is, therefore, respectfully \nrecommended that the sentence be modified, and that the defendant be ordered \ndeported forthwith.\"<\/p>\n<p>We concur with the Attorney-General and modify the judgment accordingly.

The two appellants for a long time prior to the institution of this \naction were living together openly, publicly, and scandalously as man and wife. \nAs a result of this union Buan gave birth to a child.<\/p>\n<p>Benita Dizon filed in the justice of the peace court on December 23, 1911, a \nformal complaint, which was sworn to, against these two appellants charging them \nwith having violated the provisions of article 437 of the Penal Code. A \npreliminary investigation was held, and the justice of the peace, finding that a \ncrime had been committed and that there was probable cause to believe that these \nappellants had committed the crime, issued an order directing them to appear \nbefore the Court of First Instance to answer this charge. The provincial fiscal \nupon the record, which included the complaint filed by Dizon, prepared and \npresented to the court an information charging the appellants with the same \noffense. It is now insisted that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction of \nthe persons of the appellants and the subject matter of the action, because the \ninformation was signed by the fiscal and not by the offended party. We think \nthis objection not well-founded for the reason that this criminal action or \nprosecution was instituted by the aggrieved person, Benita Dizon, when she filed \nher complaint in the court of the justice of the peace. The prosecution having \nbeen thus instituted whereby the courts acquired jurisdiction of both the \npersons and the subject matter of the action, the fiscal was authorized to file \nhis information and make it the basis upon which the proceedings in the Court of \nFirst Instance might be continued to a final determination.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs \nagainst the appellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The clause of the will in \nquestion is alleged to be as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"CLAUSE 24.\u2014<em>Item<\/em>.\u2014I declare and direct my said administrator and \nheir, as my last wish and for the good of my soul, that my said lands yielding \n9,000 <em>manojos<\/em> be given in rental for the thirds that amount to 3,000 \n<em>manojos<\/em>, as I have always given them, to various persons and that he \ncontinue it every year; and of said lands my said administrator and heir shall \ndeliver 2,000 <em>manojos<\/em> to whoever may be the very reverend father prior \nof said Bantay, whom I request and pray in recompense from him that he order \ncelebrated four masses with their vigils for the good of my soul and that of my \nsaid husband, and I charge my said brother with looking after and promptly \nexecuting this said clause, doing so as my last, wish, with the declaration that \nof the remainder for the completion of said 3,000 manojos, there be given 300 \nfor Services for the dead, 500 he shall give and deliver to the steward of the \nConfraternity of Our Lady of the said Bantay, and the 200 to complete the said \n1,000 remaining he deliver to whoever may be the very reverend prior of said \npueblo, whom I likewise pray to order celebrated the masses that may be due \ntherefor to be applied to the souls alone in purgatory, and that it may be \nrecorded, I so declare.<\/p>\n<p><em>\"Item<\/em>.\u2014I declare and revoke and annul any other instruments, \ncodicils, testaments, and other dispositions that I may heretofore have made, \nand solemnly provide that it is iny wish that none other than the present \nprevail or be accepted in or out of court; so I sign, having as witnesses Don \nManuel de Jesus, the officers of this court with me as interpreters and my said \nassociates, and of that I bear witness.\u2014Josef Verzosa, Juez Receptor.\u2014Josefa de \nla Rosa.\u2014 Dionisio Venegas.\u2014Felipe Panlasiqui.\u2014Cristobal de \nZales.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Passing all questions as to the proper construction of the will and of its \neffect as an alleged perpetual charge on the lands therein described, it is very \nmanifest that in no event could judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiff \nwithout proof that these defendants received the lands mentioned in the will \nsubject to the charge imposed by the above-cited clause 24. At the trial, \nplaintiff undertook to prove that the defendant Don Jose Purugganan and his \nco-defendants are the heirs of Dona Josefa de la Rosa, deceased; that Don Jose \nPurugganan is the administrator of the lands mentioned in the will; that certain \nlands now held by the defendants are the lands mentioned in the will; and that \nthese lands are and have been held by them subject to the annual charge imposed \nby the will.

Fillis brought to the \nPhilippine Islands a circus consisting of several trained horses, dogs, and \nmonkeys, together with paraphernalia. Upon entering the port of Manila he gave a \nbond to the Collector of Customs to export said animals and paraphernalia within \nsix months from date of entrance, or, in case of failure so to do, to pay the \nduties thereon. E. J. Hawkes, William Ahern, and A. M. Timke became sureties for \nFillis upon said bond. The property was there-upon released by the Collector of \nCustoms and entered the Philippine Islands. Thereafter Fillis executed and \nregistered a chattel mortgage on all said property to Sprungli &amp;Co. for the \nsum of P2,500. Said mortgage was later foreclosed by the sheriff and the \nproperty mentioned therein sold for P1,439.12. Said sum having come into the \nhands of the sheriff, the Collector of Customs and other creditors of Frank E. \nFillis made claim thereto. The sheriff thereupon deposited the money in court \nand began a proceeding to compel the various claimants to litigate their title \nto the fund, Sprungli &amp; Co. answered the complaint of the sheriff, setting \nup its claim under the chattel mortgage and alleging that it had a preferred \nclaim to said fund. On the 29th of July, 1912, Sprungli &amp; Co. received from \nthe sheriff all of said fund except P617 which was the sum claimed by the \nInsular Collector of Customs as being the duty on the articles which Fillis had \nimported into the Philippine Islands under bond.<\/p>\n<p>At the time that Sprungli &amp; Co. received from the sheriff said fund less \nP617, the court, by agreement of Sprungli &amp; Co. with the other creditors, \nentered the following order:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This cause coming on for hearing upon the petition of interpleader filed by \nthe sheriff of Manila, and the answers thereto of Sprungli &amp; Co. and the \nInsular Collector of Customs, both of whom appeared by their respective counsel, \nafter hearing the evidence and by agreement of both counsel.<\/p>\n<p>\"<em>It is hereby ordered,<\/em> That the said petitioner, the sheriff of \nManila, pay to the intervener, Sprungli &amp; Co., the amount of funds now in \nhis hands less all proper costs and less also the sum of P617 claimed by the \nother intervener, and that the disposition of said balance of P617 await the \ntermination of cause No. 9716 now pending in this court, wherein the recovery of \nsaid P617 is being sought upon a bond executed to secure the payment of \nsame.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The property brought into the Islands as aforesaid was not exported within \nthe time agreed and an action was accordingly brought by the Insular Collector \nof Customs upon the bond to recover the sum named therein. This action was \nnumbered 9716 and is the one referred to in the above order. This action was \nduly brought to trial and a judgment entered in favor of the Insular Collector \nof Customs as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is accordingly considered and adjudged that plaintiff have and recover \nfrom defendants the sum of one thousand five hundred (P1,500) pesos, with \ninterest thereon at 6 per cent from July 15th, 1912, together with his costs, \nbut the clerk of the court is hereby directed to apply on said judgment the sum \nof six hundred and seventeen pesos retained in his hands by this court's order \nof July 29th, 1912, in cause No. 9448.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On the entry of the judgment just referred to, Sprungli &amp; Co. objected to \nthe payment of said sum of P617 as directed by said judgment, setting up the \nclaim, that the money belonged to it. In view of this objection the sheriff made \na motion to the court setting forth that, by virtue of the order entered in the \nabove-entitled cause on the 29th of July, 1912, the amount of P617 was ordered \nto be retained in his possession to await the termination of cause No. 9716; \nthat since the entry of said order cause No. 9716 had been decided and that the \njudgment therein had ordered the said sum to be applied in partial satisfaction \nof said judgment; that said decision had been appealed but that no supersedeas \nbond had been given as required by the order approving the bill of exceptions; \nthat an execution had been issued upon said judgment at the request of the \nplaintiff; that an attempt on the part of the sheriff to apply said amount in \nthe manner and form directed in the judgment in said cause No. 9716 had been met \nwith an objection from Sprungli &amp; Co., it claiming that said money belonged \nto it; and praying that the court make a final adjudication of said controversy. \nThereupon the court on the 14th of May, 1913, entered the order which furnishes \nthe basis of the present appeal, as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This cause came on for hearing upon plaintiff's motion for a disposition of \nthe fund of P617 which by our order of July 29, 1912, was reserved pending the \ndetermination of cause No. 9716, wherein the recovery of said amount was sought \non a bond executed to secure the payment of the same. The last named case was \nplaced in judgment on December 12, 1912, and it was there directed that said sum \nbe applied on said judgment. This clause in said judgment was inserted pursuant \nto our order of July 29,1912, in cause No. 9448, which order was agreed to by \nthe attorneys for all parties in open court, after a discussion in which it was \nagreed that the sum of P617 should be so applied. Such was the understanding of \nthe attorneys present at the time, and such was the purpose of the order of July \n29. The objections to such application are accordingly overruled and the sheriff \nIs directed forthwith to execute the judgment in cause No. 9716 in accordance \nwith its terms.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The question before us arises upon the agreement which the parties made \nrelative to the disposition of the said sum of P617, which was reserved and held \nin the hands of the sheriff pending the decision of cause No. 9716. The \nappellant states its position as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The court may have thought that we intended, by the agreement, that Sprungli \n&amp; Co., through its attorneys, would comply and conform to the decision in \ncase No. 9716, but it is certainly mistaken, as the attorneys had no such \nintention. If the attorneys for Sprungli &amp; Co. had intended to agree to a \ndecision in another case they would certainly have come into that case and \ndefended the rights of their clients. Neither did the attorneys for the \nGovernment understand that we were waiving our rights to a decision on the \nmerits in this case. The intention was to await the decision in case No. 9716, \nand in case the Government was able to collect from the bondsmen the Government \nwould have an interest in the case, then this case was to have been tried and \nthe respective rights of the mortgagee under a duly registered mortgage on \nproperty released by the Government upon a bond for the payment of the duties \nthereon, could be submitted and decided.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The appellee and the bondsmen state their position as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Sprungli &amp; Co. had a large sum of money tied up for a long time and on \nJuly 29, 1912, saw that unless they consented to take a chance relative to the \nP617 that all this money would be tied up for a still longer period, and so Mr. \nArthur S. Allan then, but not now, with Messrs. O'Brien and DeWitt, attorneys \nfor Sprungli &amp; Co., did actually consent to leave the question as to the \nP617 to be determined by the court (Judge Lobingier in both cases) in cause No. \n9716. It may be true that Mr. Allan did not expect cause No. 9716 to be decided \nas it was, but he took that chance, and lost.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The appellee and the bondsmen further say:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Furthermore, the record does not show that 'neither did the attorneys for \nthe Government understand that we were waiving our rights to a decision on the \nmerits in this case.' But as a matter of fact that is <em>exactly what<\/em> the \nattorneys for the Government <em>did understand<\/em>, as clearly shown by their \naction in attempting to apply the P617 as directed.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There being no stipulation in writing by the attorneys, we are unable to say \njust what the wording of the agreement was. An interpretation of the agreement \nis given in the order of the 29th of July. That interpretation itself is not \nfree from ambiguity and the order taken as a whole does not throw very much \nlight upon the controversy before us. It is necessary, therefore, to take into \nconsideration the facts and circumstances surrounding the parties at the time \nthe stipulation was made and the order thereon entered. It is clear that, if the \naction upon the bond succeeded and the Government recovered, then the \ncontroversy between the Government and Sprungli &amp; Co. was at an end, as the \nGovernment, having collected the bond, would have no further reason to dispute \nwith Sprungli &amp; Co. the ownership of the P617. If, on the other hand, the \nGovernment should have been defeated in that action, the duty would have \nremained unpaid and there would have existed, accordingly, a reason on its part \nfor contesting with Sprungli &amp; Co. the right to the said sum. The reason, \nthen, for awaiting the determination of cause No. 9716, which was the action on \nthe bond, is clear. As we have seen, if the action went one way it would \nterminate decisively and finally the controversy between the Government and \nSprungli &amp; Co. and the latter would be left free to receive the P617. If, on \nthe other hand, the suit went against the Government, then the right to the P617 \nwould remain in as much doubt and uncertainty as if cause No. 9716 had not been \ntried. There was not a single issue that could have been raised in that action \nwhich would in any sense determine the right of the Government to the P617. The \naction being one upon a bond, the issues were limited and special and could not \ninvolve anything more than the due execution and the validity of the bond, its \nbreach, and the amount to be paid thereunder. It is clear, therefore, that the \ndetermination of the action disfavorably to the Government could, in no manner, \nassist in determining the controversy existing between the Government and \nSprungli &amp; Co. It would seem, therefore, that it could not have been the \nintention of the parties to the stipulation to be governed in their controversy \nby the decision in case No. 9716, for, as we have already seen, the resolution \nof the issues in that cause could have no possible bearing upon the issues \ninvolved between them. Their purpose evidently was to await the termination of \ncause No. 9716 to see whether or not the Government obtained its due from that \nsource, which occurrence would immediately end the controversy between the \nGovernment and Sprungli &amp; Co.<\/p>\n<p>The order appealed from is reversed and the cause remanded to the court \nwhence it came, with instructions to proceed to the determination of the issues \nraised by the pleadings in the action brought to determine the right to receive \nthe said sum of P617.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The decisions themselves disclose a not \ninfrequent lack of unanimity in the body of the court as to the application of \nthese statutory provisions to the diverse and varying facts in the different \ncases, but it will be found, nevertheless, that we have uniformly and \nsteadfastly maintained that the right of appeal from final judgments, orders, or \ndecrees entered in ordinary actions in Courts of First Instance is lost and \nabsolutely cut off, unless the aggrieved party gives notice of his intention to \nappeal\/ as required by the statute, as soon as practicable after the receipt of \nnotice of the rendition of such judgment, order, or decree. The difficulty, \nhowever, that has always confronted us in these cases, has arisen in construing \nand applying the phrase, \"as soon as practicable;\" and it needs but little \nconsideration to make it clear that this is a difficulty which cannot be met by \nany general rule covering all the multitude of varying facts and circumstances \nwhich may possibly arise in the different cases which may present themselves. \nPeculiar circumstances and exceptional conditions may render it impracticable to \ngive notice of intention to appeal in some cases within a period of time which \nwould be far in excess of that required in ordinary cases, and such cases must, \nin the very nature of things, be judged upon the special facts by which they are \ngoverned.<\/p>\n<p>It is possible, however, to determine, as we did in the case of Santillan \n<em>vs.<\/em> Almonte (24 Phil. Rep., 227), that \"where more than twenty days \nelapse from the date when a party has received notice of the entry of judgment, \nwithout his taking any steps whatever looking to the perfecting of a bill of \nexceptions, and it appears that he has failed to inform the court that he \ndesires to prosecute a bill of exceptions, such party (in the absence of \nsatisfactory proof that for some sufficient reason it was 'impracticable' to so \ninform the court that he desired to prosecute his bill of exceptions prior to \nthe time when he does in fact do so) loses his right under the provisions of \nsection 143 to perfect a bill of exceptions to the judgment. (De la Rosa \n<em>vs.<\/em> Revita, 6 Phil. Rep., 112; Yturralde <em>vs.<\/em> Santos, 5 Phil. \nRep., 485; Bryan-Landon Co. <em>vs.<\/em> American Bank, 5 Phil. Rep., 672.)\"<\/p>\n<p>It has frequently been suggested that a very much less period of time than \ntwenty days should be sufficient in all cases for the preparation and \npresentation of notice of intention to appeal. It is said that since the \npreparation of such a notice does not necessarily involve more than three \nminutes' labor, there is no sufficient reason for the extension of the time \nwithin which it may be filed, beyond the time necessary for its transmission to \nthe court wherein the judgment was rendered. But this contention overlooks the \nfact that a litigant should always have time to make up his mind whether or not \nit is advisable to prosecute an appeal from a judgment with which he is \ndissatisfied. The determination of this question may and usually should involve \nconsultation with counsel, and in many cases the employment of new or additional \ncounsel; and even after the litigant has concluded that it would be advisable \nfor him to appeal, it may well happen that his final decision in this regard \nwill turn on his ability to find the funds necessary for the prosecution of the \nappeal. Manifestly, a reasonable time should be allowed the litigant in which to \ndecide a question of this nature, and while this court has held that, in the \nabsence of satisfactory proof to the contrary, twenty days is a sufficient time \nfor this purpose, we have never dismissed an appeal for lack of due notice of \nintention to appeal, where it appeared that such notice had been filed within a \nperiod of twenty days after notice of rendition of judgment.<\/p>\n<p>In the case at bar, on appellant's own showing, more than twenty days elapsed \nfrom the date of notice, not merely of the rendition of judgment, but also from \nthe date of the receipt of notice of the order overruling his motion for-a ,new \ntrial, before he filed his notice of intention to appeal, and it is manifest, \ntherefore, that it came too late, unless accompanied by satisfactory proof that \nit was impracticable to file it within twenty days.<\/p>\n<p>Although the approval of his bill of exceptions was opposed in the court \nbelow, counsel at that time offered no explanation or excuse for the delay. His \nexplanation submitted in this court is based on three grounds: First, that he \nwas absent from Manila for three days while the period was running within which \nhis notice should have been filed; second, that during that period the office of \nthe clerk of the court was open during the forenoon only, which made it \ninconvenient for counsel to examine the records in the case; and third, that the \nbill of exceptions consisted of 44 pages and needed considerable time for its \npreparation.<\/p>\n<p>Having in mind the object for which a reasonable time is allowed for the \npresentation of notice of intention to appeal, it is very clear that the excuses \noffered by counsel are wholly insufficient. The mere preparation of such a \nnotice requires but a very few minutes of counsel's time, \"and his absence from \nhis office for three or four days on other business, by no means excuses or \nexplains his failure to prepare and file the notice while he was in his office \nand able to attend to the matter. His attempt to excuse himself because of the \nfact that the clerk's office was closed in the afternoon is also unworthy of \nserious consideration.<\/p>\n<p>The office stood open every legal working day for at least five hours, and \nthere is nothing in the record which would suggest that an inspection of that \nrecord of one-half hour's duration would not readily have disclosed any \ninformation which counsel might have desired in order to advise his client \nwhether he should or should not take an appeal. Indeed it was asserted by \ncounsel for appellee, and was not contradicted by counsel for appellant, that \nthe latter had in his office at that time copies of all the pleadings and other \nwritings in the record necessary for the preparation of his bill of exceptions. \nAs to counsel's excuses based on the size of the record, it is sufficient to say \nthat the size of the record Had and could have little to do with the question of \nfiling notice of his intention to appeal, and that as a matter of fact, the \nrecord is not so large as to justify any claim that it is very exceptional in \nthis regard.<br\/><br\/>The truth of the matter is, as it seems to us, that counsel \nin this case must have known, and did know, all that was necessary for him to \nknow in regard to the case and as to his client's wishes as to the taking of an \nappeal, long before the expiration of the twenty days which we have set as the \nutmost limit of time within which, in ordinary cases, notice of intention to \nappeal should be filed, in order to give the appellant the right to prosecute \nhis appeal. The somewhat exceptional conditions under which the original \njudgment in this case was set aside, and a new trial granted wherein the \noriginal judgment was affirmed, must have served to put both counsel and his \nclient on their guard, so that they must have anticipated the possibility and \neven the probability of an adverse decision several months prior to the date of \nentry of the first judgment; and while neither the time between the running of \nthe original judgment and the final judgment confirming it (four months), nor \nthe time during which the formal motion for a new trial was pending (eight \ndays), can be included in our estimate in applying the rule of practice as \nadopted by this court, nevertheless, we think that the lapse of all this time \nunder all the circumstances of this case serves at least to emphasize the flimsy \ncharacter of the excuses and explanations offered by counsel for the delay in \nfiling his notice of intention to appeal. In the light of all the circumstances \nas disclosed by the record we are satisfied that the delay in filing the appeal \nmust be attributed to inexcusable negligence or to the fact that it was not the \nintention of plaintiff to appeal until he changed his mind for some unknown \nreason, after the time had elapsed within which he had the right so to do. We \nconclude that his right to appeal was \"lost and absolutely cut off\" by his \nfailure to present his notice to appeal \"as soon as practicable\" after he \nreceived notice of the rendition of judgment in his case.<br\/><br\/>This court has \nbeen extremely liberal in accepting excuses and explanations for failures of \nparties to take the various steps prescribed in the course of the prosecution of \nappeals within the time allowed therefor, after notice of the intention to \nappeal has been duly filed. This, because: First, in the very nature of things, \nunavoidable or excusable delays must be anticipated in the preparation of bills \nof exceptions, printed briefs, and the like, and in bringing the record up from \nthe lower court; second, the record affirmatively disclosing that an appeal is \npending, any interested party can compel the appellant to go forward without \nunnecessary delay, under penalty of having his appeal dismissed for failure to \ndo so; and third, the record disclosing that an appeal is pending, there is no \nsubstantial danger that innocent third parties will suffer by such delays.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand no explanation or excuse for failure to file notice of \nintention to appeal within the period of twenty days can be accepted, which does \nnot clearly disclose that in truth and in fact it was impracticable to file it \nsooner. In the first place it is of the utmost importance that there should be \nan end to litigation, and that the prevailing party should be advised as soon as \npracticable whether it is his adversary's intention to carry the matter further. \nIn the second place, it is of the utmost importance, in the due administration \nof justice, that the record should clearly disclose the time when execution may \nissue \"as of right\/' to the end that the clerk may be advised as to the time \nwhen it becomes his duty to issue such execution at the request of the \nprevailing party. Upon the entry of final judgment in ordinary actions, \nexecution does not properly issue (except by special order of the court) until \nthe judgment becomes final in the sense that no appeal lies therefrom. But how \nis the clerk to satisfy himself upon this point? No difficulty presents itself \nwhere notice of intention to appeal has been filed, for in that event, the clerk \nmust presume that the right exists until the record affirmatively discloses that \nthe appeal has been abandoned or dismissed. But where the record discloses \nnothing as to the intention of the parties in this regard, there is no safe rule \nby which the clerk can be guided other than our holding that the right of appeal \nis lost and absolutely cut off unless the aggrieved party gives notice of his \nintention to appeal as soon as practicable after the receipt of notice of \nrendition of final judgment; and that where nothing to the contrary appears \naffirmatively in the record, the lapse of twenty days without the filing of such \nnotice will have that effect. In the third place, it is to be observed that the \nstrictest application of the statutory requirement as to the filing of notice of \nintention to appeal must be enforced to protect the rights of innocent third \nparties which are acquired in reliance upon the judgments entered in Courts of \nFirst Instance. Where record discloses that one of the litigants is asserting \nhis right to appeal, third parties may fairly be required to abide the \nconsequences of such appeal should they acquire an interest in the judgment \ndespite the knowledge disclosed by the record that it is subject to reversal or \nmodification on appeal. But where nothing appears in the record to indicate that \none or other of the parties expects to assert a right of appeal, it is vitally \nimportant to the interests of innocent third parties that there should be no \nuncertainty as to the rule that cuts off the right to appeal unless notice of \nthe intention to appeal be filed as soon as practicable after the rendition of \njudgment.<\/p>\n<p>It has been suggested that, in the case at bar, the filing of a motion for a \nnew trial eight days after the rendition of final judgment should be treated as \na substantial compliance with the statutory provision requiring the filing of \nnotice of intention to appeal; and that the delay of twenty-two days thereafter \nin filing the bill of exceptions should not be held to be fatal, under our \nliberal practice in this regard.<\/p>\n<p>It is true that under our rulings in the cases of De la Cruz <em>vs.<\/em> \nGarcia (4 Phil. Rep., 680), and Compania General de Tabacos <em>vs.<\/em> City of \nManila (6 Phil. Rep., 140), a motion for new trial, presented as soon as \npracticable after rendition of judgment, may be treated as an exception\"to the \njudgment, being in its very nature a \"formal protest against the justice and \nlegality of the judgment.\" But, as clearly appears from the decision in De la \nCruz <em>vs.<\/em> Garcia, it will only have the effect of relieving the party \nfrom the statutory requirement as to the filing of notice of intention to appeal \nwhen it may fairly be inferred that it was intended to have that effect. But \nthat such was not counsel's intention in filing the motion for a new trial, \naffirmatively appears from the fact that twenty-two days after the motion was \noverruled he filed a formal notice of his intention to appeal. Furthermore, even \nwere we to treat the motion for a new trial as equivalent to an exception to the \njudgment and a notice of intention to appeal, the subsequent delay of twenty two \ndays in filing the bill of exceptions would be sufficient, under the \ncircumstances of this case, to sustain an order to dismiss the appeal. The \nstatute allows only ten days for that purpose, and though we have held this \nperiod to be extendible where reasonable necessity therefor arises, we are of \nopinion, in the first place, that no necessity therefor has been shown in this \ncase, and, in the second place, that in view of the objection interposed to the \napproval and certification of the bill of exceptions in the court below, \nappellant lost his right to have such extension of time for the filing of his \nbill of exceptions by his failure either to ask for such extension in due time, \nor to offer any explanation for his delay to the trial judge upon which that \njudge might have based an order consenting to the extension of the time \nnotwithstanding the failure to apply therefor before the expiration of the \nprescribed ten-day period. (Garcia <em>vs.<\/em> Hipolito, 2 Phil. Rep., \n737.)<\/p>\n<p>The motion praying for the dismissal of the appeal in this case should ibe \ngranted, with the costs in this instance against the plaintiff.

EXPORT AND IMPORT LUMBER CO., DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The facts in this case, as disclosed by the evidence and found by the trial \njudge, are substantially as follows:\n<p>The plaintiff company was the owner of a sawmill and logging\" plant near Port \nBanga, Mindanao, and the defendant company was engaged in the lumber trade in \nthe city of Manila. The two companies had been doing business together for some \ntime, having had dealings with each other aggregating upwards of P100,000. They \nwere on the most cordial terms, and no formal written agreements were ever made \nbetween them, their business being transacted orally or by exchange of letters \nand telegrams, the relations of the two companies finally becoming so intimate \nthat a consolidation of their interests was under consideration. Such were the \nconditions when in December, 1909, F. P. Williamson, the vice-president of the \nplaintiff company, and W. W. Payne, the president of the defendant company, met \nin Manila and discussed the terms and conditions of a lumber contract which \nPayne believed he could secure in China on a profitable basis. The order that \nPayne had in view was a very important one, being for a special grade and size \nof <em>pagatpat<\/em> logs, destined for use in the construction of the mausoleum \nof the late Emperor Kuang Hsu of China. The matter of available woods was \ndiscussed, the conversation culminating in an arrangement to \"do the business \ntogether.\" In March, 1910, Williamson and Payne again met at the office of the \ndefendant company in Manila, Payne having just returned from China, where he had \ngone for the purpose of securing the contract which had formerly been discussed. \nAt this meeting Payne produced a telegram from parties in China calling for logs \nof certain large dimensions, which he stated could be somewhat reduced. The \nmatter was then discussed in detail, Payne proposing that he would secure the \norder if the plaintiff company would furnish the logs, and holding out as an \ninducement that if this contract could be secured and filled other valuable \ncontracts would follow. The former conversation in which it had been tentatively \narranged to \"do the business together\" was referred to, and the interview \nterminated in a definite and clear-cut oral agreement to undertake the business \n\"on joint account,\" the defendant company to obtain the contract, secure the \nbest possible price, and arrange for financial assistance, while the plaintiff \nwas to furnish the logs through its Mindanao plant. Williamson returned to \nZamboanga, and his company at once commenced the preliminary work of locating \nand getting out the timber. Payne was successful in securing the China order, \nand on May 6 executed in the name of his company a contract with the China \nImport and Export Lumber Company, Limited (Exhibit A), whereby he agreed to \nfurnish to the said China company about 40,000 cubic feet of <em>pagatpat<\/em> \nlogs of certain specified dimensions and in accordance with other conditions set \nforth in the contract, at the price of 90 cents United States gold, or P1.80 \nPhilippine currency, per cubic foot. Very soon after the execution of this \ncontract with the China company\u2014about the middle or the end of May\u2014Payne went to \nZamboanga and at once began machinations by means of which he succeeded in \ninducing the plaintiff company to modify the original joint account agreement \nand enter into a much less advantageous contract, which is attached to the \nrecord, marked Exhibit B. He began by suggesting a written agreement, something \ntheretofore unheard of in the dealings between the two companies, giving as his \nreason for desiring a contract in writing that \"the China people had required \nhim to sign.\" Payne grossly misrepresented the facts as to the terms of the \ncontract with the China company, and repeatedly assured the officers of the \nplaintiff company that he had been unable to secure a better price for the logs \nthan 55 centavos per cubic foot. Several conversations were had on this subject \nbetween Payne and the representatives of the plaintiff company, in which the \noriginal joint account agreement was repeatedly referred to and Payne's false \nstatements as to the price obtained by him from the China company many times \nreiterated, until finally the representatives of the plaintiff company, relying \nupon Payne's false and fraudulent representations, consented to the proposed \nmodification, which was subsequently reduced to writing in the form of a \ncontract of purchase and sale dated June 10, 1910 (Exhibit B). The plaintiff \ncompany proceeded in good faith to carry out the contract, cut and transported \nthe logs to tide water at the point agreed upon, and, upon the arrival of the \nsteamer chartered by the China company, entered immediately upon the work with a \nsufficient force of laborers and adequate equipment, but was seriously hindered \nand delayed by the defective tackle and equipment carried by the ship. The \nloading was, however, finally completed, the cargo delivered to its consignee in \nChina, and the agreed price, less certain deductions, paid to the defendant \ncompany. The contract lacked but little of completion\u2014was, indeed, practically \ncompleted\u2014when Williamson, in the course of a conversation with Seitz, the \nrepresentative of the China company, became cognizant of the fraud that had been \npracticed upon him by Payne. He at once taxed Payne with his deceit, and gave \nnotice of his intention to rescind the fraudulently obtained contract, but \npermitted the few remaining logs to be placed on board the steamship, and \nimmediately caused this action to be brought, the complaint having been filed in \nthe Court of First Instance of the Moro Province on November 14, 1910, the day \non which the loading of the steamer was completed\u2014this being the day upon which \nthe alleged fraud was discovered. Payne's only reply to Williamson's charges of \nfraud and demands for redress was that \"he stood upon the written contract.\"<\/p>\n<p>The trial judge, upon this finding of facts, rendered judgment in favor of \nthe plaintiff company for the sum of P35,140.23, that being the balance due it, \nas found by him, after annulling the written contract and allowing it a half \nshare in the net profits of the enterprise.<\/p>\n<p>The principal questions, and as we think, practically the only questions \nraised by this appeal are questions of fact. Does the evidence sustain the \nfinding, of the trial judge that Payne and Williamson had an oral agreement or \nunderstanding that their respective companies would undertake, on joint account, \nto procure and fill the contract for the delivery of certain lumber; that \nthereafter, Payne, having secured the contract, grossly deceived Williamson as \nto the terms and conditions under which he secured the contract, and led him to \nbelieve that the price to be paid for the lumber under the contract was 55 \ncentavos per cubic foot, when the fact was that the price was 90 cents, or \n\"P1.80; that by means of these false statements and misrepresentations of fact \nPayne induced Williamson to execute a written contract wherein he expressly \nobligated his company to perform its part of the joint undertaking for a fixed \nprice, much less than that which it would be entitled to receive under the \nagreement to secure and fill the contract for \"joint account;\" and that the \nplaintiff company did in fact deliver the lumber in substantial compliance with \nthe terms of the written contract, and at the same time in substantially the \nmanner and form contemplated in the original oral agreement touching the \nprocurement and filling of the lumber contract on joint account?<\/p>\n<p>These findings are all supported by the clear, definite, and unequivocal \ntestimony of the witnesses called by the plaintiff, and although a formal \ncontradiction by the manager of the defendant company of the testimony in this \nregard was read into the record by consent of counsel, we find nothing therein \nwhich would justify us in disturbing the conclusions of fact as found by the \ntrial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses testify. As was said in the case of \nUnited States <em>vs.<\/em> Benitez (18 Phil. Rep., 513) : \"A careful and \ndiscriminating trial judge has unequaled advantages to determine the relative \ncredibility of opposing witnesses. In accordance with the rule so often laid \ndown, this court will not interfere with the judgment of the trial court in \npassing upon the credibility of the opposing witnesses, unless there appears in \nthe record some fact or circumstance of weight and influence which has been \noverlooked or the significance of which has been misinterpreted.\"<\/p>\n<p>Accepting the facts thus found, it needs no extended discussion of the law or \nthe facts to sustain the rulings of the trial judge wherein he declined to \npermit the defendant company \"to stand on the written contract\" and thus profit \nby an agreement which the plaintiff company was induced to execute by the false \nand fraudulent misrepresentation of material and controlling facts by the agent \nof the defendant company. It is sufficient to say that the question here \ninvolved is not the annulment or rescission of a simple contract of purchase and \nsale on the ground of concealment or misrepresentation by one of the parties of \nfacts touching the anticipated profits or the purposes or objects inducing such \nparty to execute the contract. Alleged misrepresentations or concealment of \nfacts of this nature will not ordinarily be sufficient to justify the rescission \nof a simple contract of purchase and sale, because in such cases there is, as a \nrule, no obligation on the purchaser to furnish such information and because \nfurther the vendor in such cases will rarely be able to establish that he was \ninduced to enter upon the contract by such misrepresentations or concealments of \nfact, he, as a rule, having no interest whatever in the prospective profits of \nthe purchaser or the purposes or objects which induce the purchaser to enter \nupon the contract. (Mecham on Sales, Chap. VI, sec. 1, and cases there cited.) \nIn the case at bar, however, the relation of confidence which existed between \nthe parties, and the oral agreement under which they undertook to secure and \nfill the Chinese contract for joint account were such as to impose an obligation \non both the parties to treat each other with the utmost good faith in all \nmatters relating thereto. In making false and misleading statements as to the \nterms of the contract with the Chinese company, as to the prices secured \nthereunder, and as to the prospective profits to be anticipated therefrom, the \nmanager of the defendant company was seeking not merely to\" induce the manager \nof the plaintiff company to execute a contract of purchase and sale at the \nlowest possible price, but to induce him at the same time to forego any rights \nwhich he might have acquired under the oral agreement to secure and fill the \ncontract on joint account, and to induce him to accept, in lieu of a half share \nin the profits, a price per foot for the lumber much less than that to which he \nwould have been entitled under the oral agreement.<\/p>\n<p>Much is said in the brief of the appellant as to the alleged error committed \nby the court below in admitting and considering the evidence touching the oral \nagreement, and the statements made by the parties prior to and at the time when \nthe written contract was executed. Many authorities are cited in support of the \nproposition that oral testimony is not admissible to vary or to modify the plain \nand unequivocal terms of a written instrument. But it is to be observed that \nthere is no question here as to the meaning and intent of the written contract, \nand no attempt on the part of the plaintiff to deny its execution, or to place a \ndifferent construction upon its terms than that given to it by the defendant. \nThe contention of the plaintiff company is that the written contract was in fact \nexecuted, but that its execution was procured by the false and fraudulent \nrepresentations of the manager of the defendant company, and should not \ntherefore be held to bind the plaintiff company. All the evidence as to oral \nagreements, understandings, or representations made at the time of the execution \nof the written contract or prior thereto which tends to sustain the charge of \nfraud in procuring its execution was properly admitted, and as we hold, this \nevidence fully sustains the findings of the trial judge as to the existence of \nfraud in the execution of the contract.<\/p>\n<p>What has been said sufficiently disposes of the principal issues involved in \nthis appeal, and in regard to the remaining contentions of appellant it must \nsuffice to say that we think they are satisfactorily disposed of in the decision \nof the court below.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment entered by the trial court should therefore be, and is hereby, \naffirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

One of these switches was located at the scene of the \naccident.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff had been visiting his friend, a man by the name of Creveling, \nin front of whose house the accident happened. He desired to board a certain \n\"San Marcelino\" car coming from Santa Ana and bound for Manila. Being told by \nCreveling that the car was approaching, he immediately, and somewhat hurriedly, \npassed from the gate into the street for the purpose of signaling and boarding \nthe car. The car was a closed one, the entrance being from the front or the rear \nplatform. Plaintiff attempted to board the front platform but, seeing that he \ncould not reach it without extra exertion, stopped beside the car, facing toward \nthe rear platform, and waited for it to come abreast of him in order to board. \nWhile in this position he was struck from behind and run over by the defendant's \nautomobile.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant entered Calle Herran at Calle Penafrancia in his automobile \ndriven by his chauffeur, a competent driver. A street car bound from Manila to \nSanta Ana being immediately in front of him, he followed along behind it. Just \nbefore reaching the scene of the accident the street car which he was following \ntook the switch\u2014that is, went off the main line to the left upon the switch \nlying alongside of the main track. Thereupon the defendant no longer followed \nthat street car nor went to the left, but either kept straight ahead on the main \nstreet-car track or a bit to the right. The car which the plaintiff intended to \nboard was on the main line and bound in an opposite direction to that in which \ndefendant was going. When the front of the \"San Marcelino\" car, the one the \nplaintiff attempted to board, was almost in front of defendant's automobile, \ndefendant's driver suddenly went to the right and struck and ran over the \nplaintiff, as above described.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the trial court was for defendant. A careful examination of \nthe record leads us to the conclusion that defendant's driver was guilty of \nnegligence in running upon and over the plaintiff. He was passing an oncoming \ncar upon the wrong side. The plaintiff, in coming out to board the car, was not \nobliged, for his own protection, to observe whether a car was coming upon him \nfrom his left hand. He had only to guard against those coming from the right. He \nknew that, according to the law of the road, no automobile or other vehicle \ncoming from his left should pass upon his side of the car. He needed only to \nwatch for cars coming from his right, as they were the only ones under the law \npermitted to pass upon that side of the street car.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant, however, is not responsible for the negligence of his driver, \nunder the facts and circumstances of this case. As we have said in the case of \nJohnson <em>vs.<\/em> David (5 Phil. Rep., 663), the driver does not fall within \nthe list of persons in article 1903 of the Civil Code for whose acts the \ndefendant would be responsible.<\/p>\n<p>Although in the David case the owner of the vehicle was not present at the \ntime the alleged negligent acts were committed by the driver, the same rule \napplies where the owner is present, unless the negligent acts of the driver are \ncontinued for such a length of time as to give the owner a reasonable \nopportunity to observe them and to direct his driver to desist therefrom. An \nowner who sits in his automobile, or other vehicle, and permits his driver to \ncontinue in a violation of the law by the performance of negligent acts, after \nhe has had a reasonable opportunity to observe them and to direct that the \ndriver cease therefrom, becomes himself responsible for such acts. The owner of \nan automobile who permits his chauffeur to drive up the Escolta, for example, at \na speed of 60 miles an hour, without any effort to stop him, although he has had \na reasonable opportunity to do so, becomes himself responsible, both criminally \nand civilly, for the' results produced by the acts of his chauffeur. On the \nother hand, if the driver, by a sudden act of negligence, and without the owner \nhaving a reasonable opportunity to prevent the act or its continuance, injures a \nperson or violates the criminal law, the owner of the automobile, although \npresent therein at the time the act was committed, is not responsible, either \ncivilly or criminally, therefor. The act complained of must be continued in the \npresence of the owner for such a length of time that the owner, by his \nacquiescence, makes his driver's act his own.<\/p>\n<p>In the case before us it does not appear from the record that, from the time \nthe automobile took the wrong side of the road to the commission of the injury, \nsufficient time intervened to give the defendant an opportunity to correct the \nact of his driver. Instead, it appears with fair clearness that the interval \nbetween the turning out to meet and pass the street car and the happening of the \naccident was so small as not to be sufficient to charge defendant with the \nnegligence of the driver.<\/p>\n<p>Whether or not the owner of an automobile driven by a competent driver, would \nbe responsible, whether present or not, for the negligent acts of his driver \nwhen the automobile was a part of a business enterprise, and was being driven at \nthe time of the accident in furtherance of the owner's business, we do not now \ndecide.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed, from is affirmed, with costs against the \nappellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

This testimony of the girl is true.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant showed conclusively that the offended girl had illicit \nrelations with various young men at various times before he had carnal relations \nwith her. Upon this point the trial court said: \"The court cannot shut its eyes \nto the fact that as no attempt was made on the part of the Government to deny \nthe allegations that Aniceta Saldivia had indulged in sexual intercourse with a \nnumber of persons apparently in a promiscuous manner, the said Aniceta might \nwell be regarded by the accused as more or less a public woman. The fact remains \nthat by his own confession he did not know this until after she and he had \nentered upon their unlawful carnal relations. Nevertheless, the court is willing \nto regard this circumstance as an extenuating circumstance in favor of the \naccused,\"<\/p>\n<p>The defendant, by means of a promise of marriage, had sexual intercourse with \nthe offended girl. At the time these illicit relations began the defendant did \nnot know that Aniceta had been having illicit relations with a number of young \nmen prior thereto. Do these facts constitute the crime of seduction?<\/p>\n<p>Paragraph 1 of article 443 of the Penal Code, under which the defendant was \nconvicted and sentenced, reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The seduction of a virgin over twelve and under twenty-three years of age, \ncommitted by any person in public authority, priest, servant, domestic, \nguardian, teacher, or any person who in any capacity shall have charge of the \neducation of the woman seduced, or shall have her under his care, shall be \npunished by <em>prision correccional<\/em> in its minimum and medium \ndegrees.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Viada (vol. 3, p. 132), speaking of \"seduction,\" says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Should we have to define seduction we would say that it should be understood \nin general to be unlawful carnal intercourse with an unmarried woman or widow of \ngood reputation more than 12 years of age and less than 23. We say with an \nunmarried woman or a widow, as should it be with a married woman, it would not \nbe seduction, but adultery; we say that the unmarried woman must be more than 12 \nyears of age, as should she be younger, the act would not constitute the crime \nof seduction, but that of rape; and finally, we say of good reputation, because \nshould the carnal intercourse be with a public woman or with one of corrupt \npractices the act would constitute simply fornication Bubject only to moral and \nreligious penance, but by no means to a legal penalty.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In Webster's International Dictionary \"virgin\" is defined as \"a woman who has \nhad no carnal knowledge of man: a maid.\"<\/p>\n<p>The meaning of the expression \"a virtuous * * * female,\" as used in reference \nto the crime of seduction, was explained by the supreme court of Georgia in \nWashington <em>vs.<\/em> State (124 Ga., 423; 52 S. E., 910) as follows: \"The \ncourt instructed the jury that it was a question for them to determine, from the \nevidence submitted, whether the woman alleged to have been seduced was virtuous \nat the time of the alleged seduction\u2014'that is, had she at that time had sexual \nintercourse with another man? If she had, she was not a virtuous woman; if she \nhad not, she was a virtuous woman\/ This charge was excepted to on the ground \nthat it confined the jury to a consideration of her physical chastity, and \neliminated all consideration by the jury of any fact or circumstance tending to \nBhow Tier want of moral chastity. This exception was not well taken. The court, \nin this instruction, was giving to the jury the legal meaning of the expression \na virtuous female,' as applied to a woman who had never married, in reference to \nthe crime of seduction, and the definition given was substantially correct. The \ngeneral rule is that 'unmarried females who are virgins are virtuous; and those \nwho, by their own consent, have ceased to be virgins, are not virtuous.' \n(O'Neill <em>vs.<\/em> State, 85 Ga., 383, 407, 408; 11 S, E.,856, 857.) 'The \njury should treat (the woman alleged to have been seduced) as virtuous unless \nthe evidence, direct or circumstantial, should satisfy them that she had lost \nher virtue, by having illicit intercourse.' (McTyier <em>vs.<\/em> State, 91 Ga., \n254; 18 S. E., 140.)\"<\/p>\n<p>The supreme court of North Carolina in affirming the conviction of one \nCrowell (State <em>vs.<\/em> Crowell, 116 N. C, 1052; 21 S. E., 502), who had \nbeen convicted of seduction under promise of marriage, remarked as follows: \"The \nprecedents sustain the definition given by the court that an innocent and \nvirtuous woman is one 'who has never had illicit intercourse with any man, and \nwho is chaste and pure.' (State <em>vs.<\/em> Ferguson, 107 N. C, 841; 12 S. E., \n574.) The court properly refused to go further and charge that the prosecutrix \nmust have had a mind free from lustful and lascivious desires.' \"<\/p>\n<p>The case of Clemons <em>vs.<\/em> Seba (131 Mo. App., 378; 111 S. W., 522) was \na civil case for breach of marriage promise, accompanied with seduction. In that \ncase the Kansas City court of appeals defines and comments upon the crime of \nseduction as follows: \"Seduction, in general terms, means to withdraw one from \nthe path of rectitude. It is a leading astray. And, as applied to intercourse \nwith a woman under a promise of marriage, it implies that a woman of \n<em>previous chaste character,<\/em> has been induced to consent to unlawful \nsexual relations by persuasion and the promise to marry. Therefore, evidence of \nprevious unlawful intercourse with others destroys the very basis upon which \nseduction must rest, viz., previous chastity, and would relieve the case of such \naggravating circumstance. The evidence should have been admitted. (State \n<em>vs.<\/em> Patterson, 88 Mo., 89; 57 Am. Rep., 374; State <em>vs.<\/em> \nWheeler, 94 Mo., 252; 7 S. W., 103; State <em>vs.<\/em> Sharp, 132 Mo., 165; 33 \nS. W., 795; Broyhill <em>vs.<\/em> Norton, 175 Mo., 190; 74 S. W., 1024; Cole \n<em>vs.<\/em> Holliday, 4 Mo. App., 94.) * * * The cases above cited (State \n<em>vs.<\/em> Patterson and State <em>vs.<\/em> Wheeler) were based on a statute \nmaking one guilty of a felony who, under promise of marriage, seduces a woman of \ngood repute.' But the reasoning of the cases applies to a civil case of this \ncharacter. Those words, or those of like character, are not in the Michigan \nstatute, and yet the supreme court of that State held that previous intercourse \nwith other men went to disprove seduction, as that word is understood to mean in \nthis connection. (People <em>vs.<\/em> Clark, 33 Mich., 112.) That case is quoted \nand approved in State <em>vs.<\/em> Patterson.\"<\/p>\n<p>The Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure (Vol. 35, p. 1294), after defining \nseduction, gives \"other definitions\" in a footnote, among which is the \nfollowing: \"The word 'seduce,' as found in the statute, imports not only illicit \nsexual inter-course, but it imports also a surrender of chastity; a surrender of \nthe woman's personal virtue. The statute is for the protection of the chastity \nof unmarried women, and the existence of the virtue at the time of the \nintercourse is a necessary ingredient of the offense; for, as has been often \nsaid, the woman who has lost her chastity, the prostitute, may be the victim of \nrape, but is not the subject of seduction.\"<\/p>\n<p>The American and English Encyclopedia of Law (1st ed., vol. 21, p. 1046) sums \nup the decisions as to what is meant by chaste character in reference to the \ncrime of seduction, in the following language: \"The statutes generally require \nthat the woman seduced must have had a previous chaste character, and that must \nbe alleged in the indictment. Probably this averment must be made even though \nthe statute makes no mention of chastity, as that, as has been stated, is \nregarded by the courts as an essential feature of the offense; but it is \ngenerally held that 'character,' as used in these statutes, means actual \npersonal virtue and not merely reputation, * * *.\"<\/p>\n<p>The authorities seem unanimous that prior absolute chastity on the part of \nthe woman is an essential element of the crime of seduction, especially, so when \nmade a requisite by the express words of the statute. As we have seen from the \nauthorities cited above, the reputation of the woman is not the test; it is a \nmatter of physical conditions, of past conduct, of actual purity. The fact that \nthe man may have considered her a virgin does not seem to change the rule. His \nignorance of her previous immoral and unchaste practices cannot make her a \nvirgin in the eye of the law.<\/p>\n<p>We therefore agree with the Attorney-General that the defendant did not \ncommit the crime of seduction. The judgment appealed from is reversed and the \ndefendant acquitted with costs <em>de officio.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C, J., Carson, and Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><em>Moreland, J.,<\/em> concurs in the result.<\/p><\/div>",

The evidence of record, read together with the excellent and manifestly \nfair and unbiased report of the commissioner appointed by the trial court, \nclearly establishes the existence of the ancient right of way as set forth in \nthe complaint, and leaves no room for doubt that the defendant, for his own \nconvenience and without the consent of the plaintiffs, has and is obstructing \nthe ancient right of way by fencing it off and thus compelling the plaintiffs to \nuse another and less convenient means of passage across his land. Plaintiffs' \nevidence and the commissioner's report tend very strongly to maintain a finding \nthat the new right of way is not much less convenient and commodious than the \nold one, defendant's object in making the change being merely to move the road a \nlittle farther away from his house. The commissioner suggests that the principal \nobjection to the new right of way could be overcome by making the turn from the \nold road into the new one at an angle not quite so sharp as that in actual use, \nand his clear and comprehensive report would appear to sustain his contentions. \nBut it must be remembered that this is not a question of laying out a new road, \nin which questions of relative convenience to the public and the land owners \nwhose property is taken for the public use may properly be taken into \nconsideration. The question here submitted is whether the defendant is or is not \nobstructing an ancient right of way as alleged in the complaint; and the \nallegations of the complaint having been established in a proper action, the \nplaintiffs' right to relief cannot be defeated by proof that defendant has \nfurnished a new right of way, nearly but not quite as convenient and commodious \nas the old one. Such evidence would be of much importance if plaintiffs had \nundertaken to establish their claim of damages, but since there is no competent \nproof in the record in support of their allegations as to damages it can have no \ncontrolling influence in the disposition of the real issues involved on this \nappeal.\n<p>We are of opinion that the trial judge correctly held that the record \nsustains the plaintiffs' claim of a right of way as indicated by the arrows \nmarked number 1 on the plan of the land submitted by the commissioner and filed \nwith the record. We think however that the form of the judgment entered by him \nmust be modified. He directed merely that this road \"be opened for the public \nuse\" and by inference imposed upon the defendant the duty of so doing. But there \nis nothing in the record which would justify a finding that the defendant is \ncharged with a duty to maintain or construct a road across his land. So far as \nthe record discloses his only obligation in regard to this right of way over his \nland is a negative one, that is to say, not to obstruct or hinder the free \npassage over it of any persons entitled to make use of it. While the prayer of \nthe complaint does not clearly indicate the relief sought by the plaintiffs, we \nthink that it may fairly be construed as a prayer for a permanent injunction, \nand as that is the relief to which the plaintiffs are entitled upon the facts \nalleged and proven, the trial court should have granted a permanent injunction \nprohibiting the defendant from obstructing, by the maintenance of fences or \notherwise, the plaintiffs' passage over the ancient right of way, which the \ntrial court found to be in a direct line as indicated by the arrows marked No. 1 \non the commissioner's plan.<\/p>\n<p>Let judgment be entered reversing the judgment entered in the court below, \nwithout costs to either party.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The \nprosecution's case depends almost entirely on the testimony of one witness, \nnamed Gaspar Paguirigan, of from 12 to 15 years of age. This witness testified \nin substance as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\"Cirilo Baua invited me to come with him and follow the deceased, whom we had \nseen ride by on a carabao going in the direction of Callarin. I, knowing that \nCirilo had bad intentions toward the deceased, went with him and we came up with \nthe deceased from behind. The deceased did not see or hear us. Cirilo pulled the \ndeceased down from the carabao and attacked him with a bolo with which he \ninflicted many blows. At every blow I heard the deceased cry out, 'Pardon me.' \nWhen I had seen and heard this I ran away and while I was running away I heard \nCirilo cry out, 'Gaspar, if you are going to tell this to anybody I will kill \nyou.' On hearing this I ran the faster. I ran on home, approximately half a mile \ndistant, reaching there about 6 o'clock p. m. While I was running I fell and \nhurt my shoulder.\" [Witness' shoulder, upon being exposed to the court, showed a \nsmall scar about three quarters of an inch long.] \"I never told the Constabulary \nthat I hurt my shoulder by falling out of some bamboo trees. I scratched my left \nthumb on some bamboo two days before the day of the homicide.\" [There was a \nsmall scar still visible on the witness' thumb at the time of the trial.] \"One \nday when I was in the house of the deceased I learned that the deceased had \nstolen a penknife from Cirilo. I lived about a hundred and fifty yards from the \nhouse of Cirilo and about fifty yards from the house of the deceased. I formerly \nknew the deceased when we were planting tobacco at Marsibang, but I was neither \na friend nor an enemy of his, although I played with him. The only time when I \nwas ever at the house of the deceased was on the occasion when I saw the \ndeceased had stolen Cirilo's penknife. I usually played with the \ndeceased'sbrothers. The stains on my clothes which were exhibited were banana \nstains. The last time I had this bolo (Exhibit 4) was on Monday (November 25), \non which day a lady named Aurelia Marfil had taken it from me and since that \ntime it has been in her possession. It is not true that my mother and myself \nwent to Aurelia's house, weeping, in order to hide the bolo with her. I had some \ntrouble with the deceased at one time when I went to the river to take a bath. \nWhile I was taking this bath my carabao went to eat the deceased's pumpkins and \nwhen I went to the deceased's house to get my carabao my pin fell to the ground \nand when I asked the deceased for it the deceased addressed me in very insulting \nlanguage. I had no bolo at the time Cirilo attacked and killed the deceased. I \ndid not see any bolo in the hands of the deceased at that time.\"<\/p>\n<p>None of the other witnesses called on behalf of the prosecution claimed to \nhave been present at the scene of the homicide. Of these other witnesses the \ndeceased's mother knew, as the trial court said, \"nothing about the real facts \nin the case,\" her testimony in relation to the pursuit of the deceased by Cirilo \nand Gaspar and the latter's attack being hearsay only, obtained from information \nfrom me other than Gaspar himself. She did, however, have perrsonal knowledge \nconcerning the enmity between her son (the deceased) and Gaspar. She testified \nthat the deceased's only known enemy \"was Gaspar Paguirigan, because this man at \nthe time of cutting tobacco leaves chased my son with a bolo.\" This was in the \nmonth of March next preceding the homicide. Regarding the trouble between the \ndeceased and Cirilo over the penknife, this witness testified that the deceased \nhad returned the penknife to Cirilo two weeks before the date of the \nhomicide.<\/p>\n<p>The chief of police testified that he had investigated the case and had \nordered Gaspar's arrest. The justice of the peace who held the preliminary \ninvestigation testified that on the strength of the statement of the mother of \nthe deceased to the effect that Gaspar had previously chased the deceased with a \nbolo he had issued an order for Gaspar's arrest, and that after the deceased's \nbody had been found Gaspar pointed out the place of the homicide. The president \nof the municipal board of health testified as to the identity of the deceased \nand the forty-four wounds found on the body. This witness also testified that he \nhad examined the cuts on Gaspar's shoulder and thumb and was of the opinion that \nthey had been made by a \"cutting instrument\"<br\/><br\/>The testimony on behalf of \nthe defense tended to prove that Cirilo, at the time of the homicide, was in the \nbarrio of Reina Mercedes, and that the stains on Gaspar's shirt looked and \nsmelled like blood-stains. The Constabulary officer testified that Gaspar handed \nhim the bolo, Exhibit 4, and that bolo Exhibit 3 was found sticking in the wall \nof Gaspar's house. Aurelia Marfil testified that on Monday, after the police had \ngone for the deceased's body, Gaspar and his mother came, weeping, to her house \nin order to hide a bolo there, but that she, Aurelia, had refused to take it. \nThis witness is an aunt of Cirilo.<\/p>\n<p>Upon the evidence before it, the trial court on March 27 found: (1) That the \nwitness Gaspar Paguirigan was present when the crime was committed, if not in \nthe character of a principal, in that of an accomplice; (2) that Gaspar \nPaguirigan was the only eye-witness to the homicide; (3) that there was \"very \nlittle corroboration of his evidence with'the exception of the facts that \n(<em>a<\/em>) appellant and deceased were near neighbors and as boys played \ntogether; (<em>b<\/em>) deceased had once stolen a penknife of the defendant,\" \nand that (<em>c<\/em>) Gaspar Paguirigan, \"when arrested as a suspect and at the \n<em>tribunal,<\/em> described the place where the crime had occurred and pointed \nout the spot;\" (4) that the appellant was guilty of the crime as charged in the \ninformation.<\/p>\n<p>It is well settled that we will not interfere with the judgment of the trial \ncourt in passing upon the credibility of opposing witnesses unless there appears \nin the record some fact or circumstance of weight or influence which has been \noverlooked, or the significance of which has been misapprehended or \nmisinterpreted. (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Beriitez, 18 Phil. Rep., 513; U. S. \n<em>vs.<\/em> Ambrosio, 17 Phil. Rep., 295.) This rule necessarily presupposes \nthat a trial court is not infallible in its conclusions drawn from facts and \ncircumstances, or in its considerations, apprehension, or interpretation of \nthem. It is equally well settled that this court will reverse upon the facts the \ndecisions of trial courts if we find the facts are insufficient to warrant a \nconfirmation. (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Federizo, 20 Phil. Rep., 151; U. S. \n<em>vs.<\/em> Samonte, 20 Phil. Rep., 157.)<\/p>\n<p>We have often said, and the law so states, that every defendant in a criminal \nprosecution is presumed to be innocent, and that this presumption stands until \nit is overcome by competent evidence. This presumption may be overcome and the \nguilt of an accused person may be established by the testimony of a single \nwitness even though the witness be an accomplice. (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Sy \nQuingco, 16 Phil. Rep., 416; IJ. S. vs. Ambrosio, 17 Phil. Rep., 295; U. S. \n<em>vs.<\/em> Callapag, 21 Phil. Rep., 262.) But these decisions lay stress on \nthe rule that such testimony must leave no room for reasonable doubt. The lack \nof corroboration of the testimony of an accomplice affects his credibility as a \nwitness, but it does not affect his competency as such. If his testimony \nsatisfies the court beyond a reasonable doubt, it is sufficient. (U. S. \n<em>vs.<\/em> Callapag, <em>supra.<\/em>)<\/p>\n<p>In the case of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Ambrosio, supra, this cpurt said: \n\"It is unquestionably true that the testimony of an accomplice must be taken \nwith great care and caution. It must be assayed and weighed with scrupulous \ncare. The corroborating testimony must be strong and convincing. It is also \ntrue, however, that when the testimony of an accomplice is corroborated by \nunimpeachable testimony and by strong circumstances, it may be given its true \nweight and force against the person in regard to whom it is presented.\" <\/p>\n<p>Gaspar Paguirigan was, according to the decision of the trial court, at least \nan accomplice. His testimony must be weighed with scrupulous care. In addition \nwe cannot overlook the inconsistencies in Gaspar's testimony. In identifying the \n<em>kampilan,<\/em> Gaspar stated that he had been in the deceased's house when \nit was stolen and that this was the only time that he had ever been there. A few \nminutes thereafter he contradicted this statement by saying that he had been in \nthe deceased's house on another occasion when the deceased \"used bad language \ntoward him.\" To have lived in a small barrio as near as one hundred and fifty \nyards, as Gaspar did, without going to the deceased's house but twice, is \nsomewhat suspicious and doubtful Gaspar and the deceased were known to be \nenemies or at least to be on unfriendly terms. Gaspar's testimony to the effect \nthat Aurelia had taken his bolo and had kept it, is difficult to reconcile with \nthe testimony of Aurelia and the Constabulary soldier. Again, Gaspar's two \ndifferent stories about cutting his shoulder and thumb are suspicious, \nespecially when the medical testimony to the effect that the wounds were made by \na \"cutting instrument\" is taken into consideration. Why was Gaspar so anxious to \nshow that the stains on his clothes were not bloodstains? Why could he not have \nstated that they were bloodstains from the cut on his shoulder received when he \nfell from the bamboo? Why was he so anxious to show that they were banana stains \nwhen they looked and smelled like stains of blood? It would seem as if Gaspar \nexpected the trial court to believe that he fell from the bamboo tree, cut his \nshoulder, and got a banana stain from it.<\/p>\n<p>The story about the pin is riot convincing. Why should the fact of Gaspar's \ndropping the pin rather than the fact of the carabao's eating the pumpkin affect \nthe deceased's temper to the extent of calling Gaspar names?<\/p>\n<p>Now, looking simply to the general circumstances of the case brought out by \nthe uncontradicted testimony we find (1) that Gaspar was the first person to be \nsuspected of the homicide; (2) that he was present at it; (3) that he had fresh \ncuts on his shoulder and thumb for which he accounted in two inconsistent ways; \n(4) that he was known to be an enemy of the deceased; (5) that he himself \ntestified to the existence of bad feeling between the deceased and himself, when \nthat pin of his fell to the ground and deceased used insulting language; and (6) \nthat his clothes were found to be stained with something1 that to disinterested \nwitnesses looked and smelled like blood. All of these are matters of positive \ntruth. Under these highly suspicious circumstances Gaspar surely had everything \nto gain and nothing to lose in exonerating himself and in fixing the blame upon \nsome definite other person. This other person was appellant. By way of negative \nproof the general circumstances disclose (1) that appellant was not the first \nperson to be suspected of the homicide; (2) that there is absolutely no \nadmissible evidence, except the statement of Gaspar, that appellant was present \nat the time the deceased was killed; (3) that Gaspar was known to be an enemy of \nthe deceased; (4) that it is nowhere shown that <em>at the time of the \nhomicide<\/em> there was any trouble or any reason for any trouble between the \ndeceased and the appellant; (5) that the appellant did not have fresh cuts on \nhis hands and body made by a \"cutting instrument;\" and (6) that his clothes were \nnot found to be stained with stains that looked and smelled like human blood. Do \nthese circumstances pro and con tend to establish the guilt of the appellant \nbeyond a reasonable doubt? Do these circumstances corroborate the sole \nincriminating testimony\u2014testimony that is both intrinsically untrustworthy and \nintrinsically self-contradictory and self-contradicted\u2014of an accomplice himself \nsuspected of the crime? Are these circumstances inconsistent with the hypothesis \nthat the appellant is innocent and with every other rational hypothesis except \nthat of guilt?<\/p>\n<p>The stealing of the penknife, as we have indicated, is absolutely the only \nevidence in support of the contention that bad blood existed at one time between \nthe deceased and the appellant. The penknife having been returned, as stated by \nthe witnesses, two whole weeks before the date of the homicide, it would seem \nthat there was left no convincing reason for the existence of subsequent bad \nblood between these two parties.<\/p>\n<p><br\/>From the whole record it appears to us that the trial court failed to \ngive due weight to the testimony of .the witnesses and the evidence offered on \nbehalf, of the appellant. Of the witnesses called on behalf of the appellant at \nleast three, the Constabulary corporal, the<em> teniente<\/em> of the barrio, and \nthe municipal president, were totally disinterested. The other two witnesses, \nthe appellant himself and his aunt, were interested, but their testimony is \ncompetent and no more suspicious <em>per se,<\/em> or of no more doubtful nature, \nthan that of Gaspar, upon whose testimony alone the conviction rests. All three \nof the disinterested witnesses saw the stains on Gaspar's clothes, and, as we \nhave said, Gaspar had good cause to fix the blame on some other person than \nhimself. As opposed to this there is the positive evidence, no less reliable \nthan Gaspar's, that appellant was not at the place when the killing occurred. \nNone of the testimony of the witnesses called on behalf of the appellant is \ninconsistent but appears to be a straightforward relation of actual facts within \ntheir knowledge. We must therefore conclude that the evidence fails to show \nbeyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of the appellant of the crime committed.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from must be reversed and the \ndefendant acquitted with costs <em>de oflicio.<\/em> So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

PROTESTATO MALUNDA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<\/title>This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance convicting \nthe defendant and appellant of the crime of estafa. The commission of the crime \nis charged in|he information as follows:\n<blockquote>\n<p>\" Que en o hacia el mes de Agosto del presente ano 1913, en el municipio de \nBalasan, provincia de Iloilo, Islas Filipinas, el referido acusado voluntaria, \nilegal y criminalmente y mediante fraude y engano recibio y obtuvo de Gil \nBilaran la suma de noventa pesos (P90.00) con la expresa obligacion de pagar con \ndicha suma los derechos de pesqueria llamado 'sapiao', que estaba en deber dicho \nGil Bilaran, y el citado acusado en lugar de ingresar en la tesoreria municipal \nla mencionada cantidad, como se habia obligado hacerlo, se apropio los noventa \npesos para sus usos propios y lucro personal en perjuicio del referido Gil \nBilaran, hecho cometido con infraccion de la Ley. \"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From the evidence adduced by the prosecution it appears that on August 17, \n1913, one Gil Bilaran, a fisherman from the barrio of Pantalan, municipality of \nBalasan, Iloilo Province, stopped at the barrio of Estancia while en route to \nBalasan for the purpose of paying his fishing license tax, and that upon \nlearning that the municipal treasurer was in the barrio he called at the house \nof councilman Venancio Cudilla to see the treasurer; that he there met Cudilla \nand the defendant the municipal president, and was informed that the treasurer \nhad left; that the defendant then undertook to accomodate him by taking the \nmoney and turning it over to the treasurer; that Bilaran then gave the defendant \nP90 in the presence of Cudilla, which amount was to be turned over to the \ntreasurer in payment of Bilaran's fishing license; that the defendant did not \nturn the money over to the treasurer nor return it to Bilaran, and allowed the \ntax to become delinquent.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant admitted that he met Gil Bilaran at the House of Venancio \nCudilla and was told by him that he desired to pay his fishing license, but \ndefendant swore that the municipal treasurer was there at that time and that the \nmoney was given to the treasurer. The defendant's testimony in this regard was \ncorroborated by that of one Fausto Alfuente, the chief of the municipal police, \nwho claimed that he also was at the house of Cudilla at the time when Bilaran \ncalled, and that he witnessed the payment of the money to the municipal \ntreasurer.<\/p>\n<p>The trial court accepted as true the testimony of the complaining witness and \ndeclined to believe the story told by the defendant and his witnesses, and \nconvicted the defendant of the crime with which he was charged in the \ninformation, sentencing him at the same time to six months of arresto mayor, to \nthe indemnification of the complaining witness in the sum of P90, with \nsubsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to the payment of the \ncosts.<\/p>\n<p>The only real questions raised on this appeal are questions of fact which \nturn largely on the degree of credit which should be accorded the various \nwitnesses called for the prosecution and the defense. Nearly 150 pages of \ntypewritten testimony was taken in the court below, and there is a decisive \nconflict in the account of what occurred at the time that Bilaran called at the \nhouse of Cudilla, as given by Bilaran, Cudilla and other witnesses called for \nthe prosecution and that given by the defendant and his witness the chief of \npolice. In the very nature of things the testimony of either one group of \nwitnesses or the other is false. The trial judge accepted the account of these \nincidents as given by the witnesses for the prosecution, and refused to believe \nthe testimony of the accused and his witnesses. We find nothing in the record \nwhich would justify us in disturbing his findings in this regard.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for appellant submits an exhaustive brief in which he undertakes to \nanalyze the testimony of the various witnesses called at the trial, and insists \nthat certain apparent inconsistencies and contradictions in the testimony of the \nvarious witnesses called for the prosecution are such as to raise a reasonable \ndoubt as to the truth of their evidence.<\/p>\n<p>Upon a careful review of the whole record we find nothing which would justify \nus in disturbing the findings of fact by the trial judge. The typewritten \ntranscript of the testimony clearly discloses that all these witnesses were \nsubjected to a close and searching cross-examination, and the questions \npropounded by the trial judge himself clearly indicate that he was fully alert \nto the possibility that the defendant might be the victim of a conspiracy. He \nappears to have carefully examined and considered the alleged contradictions and \ninconsistencies between the testimony of the various witnesses, and to have \ngiven them due weight in making his findings. Nevertheless he had no hesitation \nin finding that the testimony of the accused and of his principal witness, the \nchief of police, was unworthy of credence, and in accepting as true in all \nsubstantial and material matters the testimony of the witnesses for the \nprosecution.<\/p>\n<p>In discussing the testimony of these witnesses the trial judge said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\" These witnesses were cross-examined by counsel for the defense and by the \ncourt also, trying in every way to find out if they were telling the truth. \nCudilla was a man of more than the average intelligence. His manner of \ntestifying would impress anybody that he was telling the truth absolutely, so \nfar as I can see or find out, without any interest whatever in the result of \nthis trial. Gil Bilaran was a man of average intelligence. He told a little \ndifferent story about the manner in which he gave the money to the presidente, \nthis defendant, from that told by Cudilla but it was not anything that made one \nsuspicious of the truth of their statements. The treasurer said that he went to \nCudilla's house and stayed only a few minutes and that he went out to a cocoanut \ngrove to see about the taxes on tuba and that he did not see Gil Bilaran at all. \nYet the presidente and his policeman swore that none of them left the house from \n12 o'clock until half past 3 when they sailed for Binonan. Cudilla said himself \nthat the treasurer only stayed in his house a few minutes and was not there at \nany time after Gil Bilaran came. To authorize the acquittal of this defendant it \ncould only be done by imputing perjury to Cudilla, to the treasurer,to the \ntraveling deputy, and to Bilaran and believing him and ths policeman in \npreference.<\/p>\n<p>\" This chief of police, his manner on the stand, his hesitation, and \nembarassment at every question all indicated that he was not telling the truth. \nHe swore that Cudilla had cases dismissed and was confronted with his own \nrequest to the justice of the.peace to dismiss the very men that he said Cudilla \nhad the cases dismissed against. He then said that the presidente directed him \nto do it and the presidente intimated that he had made some enemies for favors \nnot shown to them and that he was doing this to curry favor when asked about it. \nSo far as I am able to apply the rules in giving weight to evidence; so far as I \ncan tell by any knowledge I might have of human nature and experience in \nlistening to witnesses, there isn't any doubt in my mind that the chief of \npolice swore a malicious lie when he said that this treasurer collected that P90 \ninstead of the presidente. He did not deliver his statement in such a way that \nmade it reasonable or easily believed. He was embarassed throughout; refused to \nanswer some questions until pressed very hard or directed by the court to \nanswer, and in every way showed that he was not telling the truth. When this \ncase was first set for trial and continued at this defendant's request he did \nnot at that time accuse the treasurer of stealing the money; did not intimate \nsuch a thing, and it seems that the whole defense of accusing this treasurer of \nstealing the P90 instead of himself was made up after he was told what the chief \nof police's testimony would amount to, it being simply negative \ntestimony.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We have no doubt that the trial judge's conclusions in this regard were well \nfounded, and we find no error in the proceedings prejudicial to the substantial \nrights of the accused<\/p>\n<p>The judgment entered in the court below convicting and sentencing the \ndefendant and appellant should therefore be affirmed, with the costs of this \ninstance against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p>It is so ordered.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

Addison, having been condemned to pay a fine of P100, to \nindemnify the injured party in the sum of P500, with subsidiary imprisonment in \ncase of insolvency, and to the payment of the costs of the cause, for a \nviolation of the provisions of section 106 of General Orders No. 58, appealed to \nthis court.\n<p>On the 23d of December, 1912, the appellant subscribed and swore to an \naffidavit wherein he stated that on or about the 20th of that month at 8.30 a. \nm. he saw various bottles containing compounds of opium in an <em>aparador<\/em> \nsituated in the upstairs <em>sala<\/em> of the house of John McStay in Lucena, \nTayabas. On the same day the Court of First Instance issued a search warrant, \nbased upon that affidavit, directing the sheriff to search the house of McStay \nand seize the opium. In compliance with this warrant the sheriff proceeded \nimmediately to search the house, but found nothing of a contraband nature, and \nso reported to the court. Subsequent thereto, and on the 3d day of January, \n1913, John McStay filed a sworn complaint (denuncia), charging the appellant \nwith the \"crime of malicious prosecution\" and alleging that the appellant did, \non the 23d day of December, 1912, willfully and maliciously, with the sole \nintent and purpose of gratifying his personal resentment against the \ncomplainant, procure and obtain, without any probable cause whatever, a search \nwarrant \"of the person, residence, and place of business of the undersigned, by \nsigning and swearing before the Honorable Herbert D. Gale, judge of the Court of \nFirst Instance, certain malicious, false, and defamatory statements, known to be \nfalse and defamatory by said accused.\" On the 11th of April, 1913, the \nprovincial fiscal filed a formal complaint against the appellant charging him \nwith the same crime and setting forth the same allegations as in the \ncomplainant's <em>denuncia<\/em>. After trial, the judgment above stated was duly \nentered.<\/p>\n<p>For the purpose of showing that the search warrant was procured \"maliciously \nand without probable cause,\" the prosecution presented seven witnesses, who \ntestified substantially as follows:<\/p>\n<p>Juan Merchan, clerk of the court, and Agapito Villa senor, sheriff, testified \nonly in reference to the filing of the affidavit upon which the search warrant \nwas based, the issuing of the warrant, and the search of the complainant's \npremises.<\/p>\n<p>John McStay, the complainant, testified that for some time prior to the 23d \nof December, 1912, he was running a hotel and canteen in Lucena, Tayabas; that \nthe appellant lived in his hotel from the 28th of September until the 23d of \nDecember; that pn the 23d of December the appellant left his hotel on account of \ncertain disturbances which occurred therein on the previous night j that these \ndisturbances were caused by three of four guests, and disturbed the appellant's \nsleep; that on the following day the appellant had a quarrel with one of these \nguests; that at the time he left he was angry and stated that he desired to \nleave the hotel and would arrange his account on the following day; that when he \n(the witness) bought the hotel he also bought the beds and the \n<em>aparadores;<\/em> and that he and the appellant were friends, never having \nhad any trouble. As to the damages suffered by the complainant on account of the \nsearch of his premises, he stated that some persons did not know whether he was \nguilty or not, and, therefore, stayed away from his hotel during those days, \nresulting in damaging him in the sum of P500.<\/p>\n<p>James R, Gittings testified that he was one of the persons who were making \nthe noise in the hotel on the night of the 22d, while the appellant was sleeping \nupstairs; that the appellant called their attention to these disturbances and \nasked them to stop so that he could sleep; and that on the following day he and \nthe appellant had a quarrel.<\/p>\n<p>Thomas Hoey, an internal-revenue agent, testified that he accompained the \nsheriff at the time the complainant's hotel was searched; and that he induced \nthe appellant to present the affidavit upon which the search warrant was based, \nafter the appellant had stated to him that opium could be found in McStay's \npossession.<\/p>\n<p>Guy B. Shiller, principal of the Lucena High School, testified that he had a \nconversation with the appellant and Hoey at the government building, and that he \nheard Hoey ask the appellant if the latter would make an affidavit for the \npurpose of securing the search warrant, and the appellant answered that he \nwould.<\/p>\n<p>Jose Nieva, an employee in the Bureau of Agriculture, stated that he was \nacquainted with Benigna Robles, a witness for the defendant; that on the 24th of \nDecember he returned to Lucena from Manila, and that when the train stopped at \nCalamba about 10 a. m., he saw Benigna Robles in the train.<\/p>\n<p>The defense presented four witnesses; Joseph Rosemblatt, Charles R. Duffin, \nBenigna Robles, and the appellant.<\/p>\n<p>Rosemblatt testified that he lived in Lucena up until some time in the month \nof August, 1912; that at that time a Mr. Salmon owned the canteen and hotel \nwhich was searched by the sheriff; that he was in an automobile accident when \none of the passengers had his arm dislocated and, upon returning to Lucena after \nthe accident, they went to the drug store to get some opium liniment; that the \npharmacist refused to sell them this medicine without a doctor's prescription; \nthat the following day he went to the canteen, which was located in the hotel, \nand was then informed by a Mr. Henson that the canteen had some 25 bottles of \nvarious kinds of medicines; that these bottles were shown him in an \n<em>aparador<\/em>; and that on taking hold of one of the bottles he discovered \nthat it contained an opium mixture.<\/p>\n<p>Duffin, who was a mechanical engineer at that time, stated that he knew the \ncanteen owner, at the time the search warrant was issued, to be McStay; that \nwhen he first knew the hotel it was owned by one Henson; that at the time he \nleft Lucena McStay was negotiating for the purchase of that hotel; that he saw \nin this hotel on various occasions opium in an <em>aparador<\/em>; and that this \n<em>aparador<\/em> was upstairs.<\/p>\n<p>Benigna Robles testified that she was a dancing girl in McStay's saloon in \nDecember, 1912; that two days before Christmas she saw Hoey and McStay talking \ntogether in the hotel and heard Hoey use the word \"Addison;\" that after Hoey and \nMcStay terminated their conversation, Henson entered the room upstairs and took \nout of the <em>aparador<\/em> some bottles and put them in his pocket; and that \nthat same afternoon the search was made.<\/p>\n<p>Section 106 of General Orders No. 58 reads: \"Any person who shall procure a \nsearch warrant maliciously and without probable cause, and any officer who shall \nunlawfully exceed his authority or use unnecessary severity in executing the \nsame, shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than one year or by a fine \nof not exceeding one thousand pesos, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\"<\/p>\n<p>This section requires that both <em>malice<\/em> and absence of <em>probable \ncause<\/em> must exist concurrently in order to justify a conviction. If the \nappellant's act in making the affidavit was malicious and unfounded, but there \nwas probable cause for such act, he must be acquitted. \"In a legal sense' says \nGreenleaf (vol. 2, sec. 453, 16th. Ed.), \"any unlawful act done willfully and \npurposely to the injury of another; is, as against that person, malicious.\u201d \nMalice cannot be inferred from the fact that no opium was found in the house of \nthe complainant by the sheriff.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Probable cause may be defined as such reasons, supported by facts and \ncircumstances, as will warrant a cautious man in the belief that his action, and \nthe means taken in prosecuting it, are legally just and proper.\" (Burton \n<em>vs.<\/em> St. Paul, M. &amp; M. Ry. Co., 33 Minn., 189.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Addison lived in McStay's hotel from September 28 to December 23, when he \nleft on account of certain disturbances in the hotel on the night of the 22d.' \nMcStay took no part in these disturbances. He and Addison were, according to his \nown testimony, friends. But it is said that the fact that Addison in effect \ncharged McStay with the commission of a serious crime is inconsistent with the \nlatter's testimony to the effect that they were friends. McStay said that they \nwere friends, and he is the person who claims to have been injured. Again, \nAddison was induced by the internal-revenue agent to make the affidavit. In so \ndoing he was carrying out his obligation as an \"informer,\" and as such informer \nhe had reasonable cause to believe that he would be rewarded therefor in \naccordance with certain provisions of the Opium Law.<\/p>\n<p>Rosemblatt testified that he saw opium in the aparador before McStay bought \nthe hotel. Duffin testified to the same effect and, also, that at the time he \nsaw the opium McStay was negotiating for the purchase of the hoteL Benigna \nRobles said that she saw opium in the hotel two days before Christmas. She also \ntestified in effect that McStay was notified of the issuance of a search warrant \nand caused the opium to be removed. The prosecution attempted to show that this \nwitness was not in Lucena on the 23d of December, and for this purpose presented \nJose Nieva, who testified that on his return to Lucena on the 24th he saw \nBenigna in the train at Calamba. It does not appear that Benigna could not have \ncome to Manila on the afternoon or night of the 23d, or even on the morning of \nthe 24th. We must, therefore, conclude that there was an absence of malice on \nthe part of the defendant in making the affidavit and that there existed \nprobable cause for making the affidavit.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from is reversed and the \ndefendant acquitted, with costs <em>de officio.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The complaint alleges that the said \naccused on said date did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously \nhave in his possession and under his control two centigrams of opium. Upon said \ncomplaint the defendant was duly arrested, arraigned, tried, found guilty, and \nsentenced to pay a fine of P300, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary \nimprisonment, as provided by law, and to pay the costs. From that sentence the \ndefendant appealed to this court.\n<p>In this court the appellant alleges that the proof adduced during the trial \nof the cause was insufficient to show that he was guilty of the crime \ncharged.<\/p>\n<p>An examination of the record brought to this court shows that on or about the \n13th day of January, 1914, two policemen of the city of Manila entered a \nbuilding at No. 109 Calle Rosario, and made a search for opium and other \nevidence of a violation of the Opium Law. They entered a room in said building \nand there found the defendant. Said policemen testified that they found a strong \nodor of opium, indicating that there were some persons in said building smoking \nopium. They testified that they found that the hands of the defendant and his \nclothing bore stains of opium. They also found stains of opium upon the bed or a \nboard that was used for a bed by the defendant. They also found under the bed \nthe lid of a can which they claimed bore some evidence that it had, at some \ntime, contained opium. A chemical analysis was made of the clothing, which \nshowed that the stains were caused by opium. Said proof sustains the allegation \nthat the defendant had had in his possession opium, but it does not sustain the \nallegation that he was then and there in the possession of opium. A mere stain \nupon the clothing or hand of an individual, caused by some particular substance, \ncertainly cannot sustain the charge that he was at that time in possession of \nthat substance. We do not believe that because a man's hands or clothing are \nstained with earth, that he can be charged with having in his possession real \nestate. The law specifically provides the punishment for one who has \"in his \npossession or under his control\" opium. Neither said section 31 nor section 3 \nabove referred to attempts to punish one for having had in his possession or \nunder his control opium.

Counsel for the plaintiff saved his exception thereto and \nasked for a new trial, which motion was denied by order of June 25, with \nexception on the part of the appellant, who presented the proper bill of \nexceptions, which was approved, certified, and forwarded to the clerk of this \ncourt with the evidence taken in the case.<\/p>\n<p>The present action deals with the petition for divorce presented by Filomena \ndel Prado, asking that she be separated from her lawful husband Tirso de la \nFuente, with whom she contracted marriage on June 17,1893. Her claim is based on \nthe fact that, after they had lived together from their marriage up to the year \n1910, in June of that year her husband separated from and abandoned her and went \nto live in marital relations with Basilisa Padilla, a woman married to Isidro \nNicolas; and therefore in the petition for divorce formulated by the wife of the \ndefendant the ground therefor was stated to be the concubinage committed by her \nhusband, in that he was illegally united with another woman who was not his \nwife.<\/p>\n<p>The jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance is taken for granted, as it \nwas not discussed, to hear and decide the present case in accordance with the \nprovisions of various laws of titles 2, 9, and 10 of the fourth Partida and of \nsection 56 of the Organic Act, No. 136 of the Philippine Civil Commission, from \nthe provisions whereof and of other laws cited in the case of Benedicto vs. De \nla Rama (3 Phil. Rep,, 34) it is inferred: (1) That the fact of concubinage of \nthe legally married husband with another woman who is not his wife is classified \nas adultery by the said laws of the Partidas, just as the crime of concubinage \nis included in the chapter of the Penal Code in force treating oi adultery, and \nthe supreme court Of Spain adopted the same classification of adultery in its \ndecision of April 3, 1884, rendered in a trial for concubinage under article 452 \nof the Penal Code of Spain, analogous to article 437 of the code in force in \nthese Islands; (2) that the fact of concubinage, as adultery committed by the \nhusband with another woman to the humiliation of his own wife, is also legal \nground for seeking divorce on the part of the injured woman; (3) that a \nprosecution for concubinage, as characterized in the ancient laws on adultery, \ncan be maintained .by the injured woman against the husband having the \nconcubine; and (4) that the decision or judgment granting the divorce, with its \nconsequences, does not dissolve the matrimonial bond but only provides for \nseparation and suspension of the common life between the husband and wife and \npartition of their common property.<br\/><br\/>It has been held in a positive manner \nthat the laws of the Partidas are the only ones applicable to divorce suits, for \nafter the present Civil Code had been in force in these Islands twenty-four days \na decree of the general government, dated December 29, 1889, issued by virtue of \na telegraphic order of the Spanish Government, as published in the Official \nGazette of Manila under date of the 31st of the same month and year, suspended \nthe application and observance in these Islands of articles 42 to 107 and 325 to \n332, comprised in titles 4 and 12, Book I, of the Civil Code.<\/p>\n<p>In order, then, to decide whether the petition for divorce presented by the \ninjured wife can be granted, it would be sufficient to determine whether the \nconcubinage of the defendant husband accompanied with scandal and humiliation to \nhis lawful wife, in uniting with another woman who has a husband still living, \nhas been duly proven in this case. Such really appears to be fully demonstrated \nand his acquittal in the case prosecuted against him and his concubine at the \ninstance of the latter's husband, Isidro Nicolas, cannot exonerate the defendant \nTirso de la Fuente, because in that trial for adultery it was not successfully \nshown nor proven that the defendant knew that his concubine Basilisa Padilla was \na married woman, wherefore his acquittal was based on the provision of the code \nto the effect that in order to commit the crime of adultery, the married woman \nmust lie with a man other than her husband and he who lies with her must know \nthat she is married, and as the defendant alleged in said case, without \ncontradiction, that he did not know that his concubine was a married woman, he \nwas acquitted of the charge of adultery, and the accused woman alone was found \nguilty, since it was shown that she was joined in lawful matrimony with her \nhusband Isidro Nicolas, that she had separated from him and had lived with her \ncodefendant, Tirso de la Fuente. <\/p>\n<p>Both in the record of the case for adultery presented at this trial as \nevidence and in this case itself it appears to be fully proven that the \ndefendant Tirso de la Fuente and Basilisa Padilla lived together in the former's \nhouse in Santa Barbara, Pangasinan, for after the husband separated from his \nwife he lived in marital relations from 1910, up to the date of the filing of \nthe information in said case, in company with the said Basilisa Padilla, they \nhaving eaten together and slept in the same bed, and for that reason the woman \nwas found guilty of the crime of which she was accused in the case for \nadultery.<\/p>\n<p>It was alleged on defendant's behalf that adultery is the only ground upon \nwhich divorce can be granted, and that, although Tirso de la Fuente had been \naccused of adultery, he had been acquitted in the case prosecuted against him \ntherefor. This acquittal is no impediment to granting the petition for divorce \non the ground that it is based on the concubinage of the defendant.<\/p>\n<p>The intimate life together and carnal relations of the defendant De la Fuente \nwith Basilisa Padilla constitute adultery to the moral injury of the latter's \nhusband Isidro Nicolas, and at the same time concubinage to the humiliation of \nthe plaintiff, said defendant's wife. It is a criminal act partaking of the \nnature of a double crime.<\/p>\n<p>Laws 2 and 3, title 9, of the fourth Partida, authorize the husband to \nprosecute his wife for adultery and the injured wife as well to prosecute her \nhusband for said crime, which is classified later in the modern law as \nconcubinage; and once the charge that the wife has commited adultery, or the \nhusband concubinage, has been proven, the courts can decree the divorce in \naccordance with the provisions of law 3, title 2, of the fourth Partida.<\/p>\n<p>The decision declaring the divorce to have been properly granted in this \nsuit, on the ground that concubinage of the defendant husband with the \nadulteress Basilisa Padilla has been proven, does not conflict with the final \njudgment rendered in said case for adultery, prosecuted at the instance of the \nhusband of the adulteress, because the fact that the adultery has been punished \non account of the offense committed against the husband injured thereby and the \njudgment of acquittal in favor of the plaintiff's husband in that case, for the \nreason stated, do not affect her rights, nor form an obstacle to granting this \npetition, after the fact of the concubinage of the defendant husband has been \nheld to be established in this case.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from should be reversed and \nthe divorce sought by the plaintiff be granted, as we do hereby grant it; and to \nthat end we order the separation and suspension of the common life of the \nlitigating spouses and the partition of the property of the conjugal partnership \nbetween the two, their minor, child named Emilio to remain in possession and \nunder the care of its mother the plaintiff, the innocent party; and the costs of \nboth instances to be imposed upon the defendant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Respecto de Paulino Halili, no se ocupara esta decision por haber sido \nabsuelto.\n<p>Del proceso resulta debidamente probado que al anochecer del 26 de Febrero de \n1913, al pasar Esteban Manipon con algunos compa\u00f1eros entre ellos unos soldados \nde la policia constabularia cerca de un canal de riego en el sitio de pasig, del \npueblo de Bambang, Tarlac, tuvo una disputa con el acusado Sanchez que alli \nestaba, por haber este cerrado la presa de dicho canal de uso comun para todos \nlos due\u00f1os de sementeras en dicho sitio, y entonces Manipon amenazo al Sanchez \ncon denunciarle y a sus compa\u00f1eros ante la autoridad por el cierre que habia \nejecutado, en esto Sanchez enseguida agredio a Manipon con un pedazo de ca\u00f1a \nentera, dandole dos golpes uno detras de la oreja izquierda y otro en el costado \nderecho y a consecuencia de las contusiones que habia recibido estuvo enfermo e \nimpedido de trabajar durante 16 dias en que fue asistido por un medico \nfacultativo, habiendo quedado de resultas de la agresion tendido en tierra sin \nconocimiento el lesionado, por lo que el sargento de constabularios que \npresencio el hecho persiguio al agresor, quien despues de ejecutado el hecho se \necho a correr y en efecto fue aprehendido momentos despues.<\/p>\n<p>El referido hecho es constitutivo del delito de lesiones menos graves \ncomprendido en el Art. 418 del Codigo penal, por cuanto que las lesiones del \nofendido se curaron a los 16 dias sin da\u00f1o ni consecuencia alguna, por mas que \nel ofendido no pudo dedicarse a sus trabajos habituales durante los dias de su \ncuracion.<\/p>\n<p>El acusado Jorge Sanchez no se declaro culpable y alego; que por haber sido \nagredido por el ofendido con un baston, el exponente en defensa le correspondio \ncon otros golpes del palo de ca\u00f1a de que estaba provisto, alegando que entonces \nrecibio un golpe en uno de sus hombros, aunque no consta que haya recibido en el \ncontusion alguna.<\/p>\n<p>No aparece satisfactoriamente justificada la alegacion del acusado de que el \nofendido fue el primero en acometerle, pues aparte de que no se ha conseguido \nprobar que Manipon llevase baston o palo en aquella ocasion, el sargento \nconstable Eugenio Lasco y los vecinos Basilio Maristela y Dionisio Cadiang que \npresenciaron lo ocurrido, afirmaron terminantemente que despues de una ligera \ndisputa que medio entre el acusado y el ofendido Esteban Manipon al llegar este \na las inmediaciones de dicho canal, el acusado enseguida agredio con un palo de \nca\u00f1a al Manipon y al ver a este caer en tierra se echo a correr, por lo que fue \nperseguido y aprehendido por dicho sargento, por lo que no es posible dar \ncredito a la alegacion del acusado de que fue agredido previamente por el \nofendido, pues que no resulto que tuviera lesion alguna en el cuerpo, mientras \nque el lesionado recibio fuertes contusiones certificadas por el medico Sr. \nNepomuceno que le asistio, sin que pueda merecer atencion las declaraciones de \nlos medicos Sres. Castro y Catanjal, referentes a que las contusiones del \nagraviado eran curables en 7 dias, porque estos solo hicieron un solo \nreconocimiento en la persona del lesionado, mientras que el Dr. Nepomuceno le \nasistio durante varios dias hasta que quedo completamente curado.<\/p>\n<p>En la comision del delito no procede apreciar la concurrencia de \ncircunstancia alguna atenuante ni agravante, como tampoco la 3.a Art. 9.0 del \nCodigo penal, en razon a que el palo de ca\u00f1a exhibido durante la vista de la \ncausa empleado con fuerza, asi es que quedo roto, es bien mortifero, y dado el \ngolpe en el lado izquierdo de la cabeza, no es posible afirmar que el agresor no \ntuviera intencion de causar da\u00f1o al paciente como el producido, pues las \ncontusiones en la cabeza suele ser a veces de pronostico reservado.<\/p>\n<p>En cuanto a la pena de multa impuesta en la sentencia apelada las frases con \nque aparece redactado el Art. 418 del Codigo demuestran que la Ley ha se\u00f1alado \npena alternativa de arresto o de destierro y multa que impondran los Tribunales \nsegun su prudente arbitrio, y por consiguiente la multa solo podra imponerse con \nla pena de destierro mas no con la personal de arresto.<\/p>\n<p>Por lo que respecta a la parte de indemnizacion consistente en los honorarios \ndel medico que asistio al lesionado, el Tribunal ajustandose a lo dispuesto en \nlos Arts. 121 y 122 del Codigo penal, y dados el numero de dias en que tardo en \ncurarse el ofendido, la indole y naturaleza de las contusiones recibidas, el \nnumero de visitas que hizo al paciente el medico Sr. Nepomuceno y el trabajo por \neste empleado para obtener la sanidad de unas contusiones menos graves a los 16 \ndias, estima en justicia que sus honorarios en el presente caso no deben exceder \nde los 60 pesos que ha cobrado, por lo que con los jornales perdidos por no \nhaber podido trabajar el ofendido, la indemnizacion queda reducida a noventa y \ndos pesos.<\/p>\n<p>Por estas consideraciones en las que quedan refutados los errores atribuidos \na la sentencia apelada, procede que sea condenado como condenamos a Jorge \nSanchez en la pena de tres meses de arresto mayor, en las accesorias del Art. 61 \ndel Codigo, en la indemnizacion de 92 pesos al ofendido y en caso de insolvencia \nen la prision subsidiaria correspondiente con abono en la condena personal de la \nmitad del tiempo de prision preventiva sufrida y en las costas, quedando \nsuprimida la multa impuesta y confirmando asi en lo conforme la sentencia \napelada y revocandola en la que no lo estuviere, con las costas de esta \ninstancia a cargo del enjuiciado.<\/p>\n<p>Trascurridos diez dias desde la notificacion de esta decision, dictese \nsentencia a tenor de lo resuelto y diez dias despues, devuelvase la causa al \nJuzgado de su procedencia para los efectos a que en derecho hubiere lugar.<\/p>\n<p>Asi se ordena.<\/p>\n<p>C O N F O R M E S :<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano J., Johnson J., Moreland J.,<\/em> and<em> Araullo \nJ.<\/em><br\/><\/p><\/div>",

THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">From the record it appears that on or about the 12th day of October, 1912, \nthe said Loo Sing, of the age of 52 years, and his three alleged sons Loo Tong, \nof the age of 20 years, Loo Gee, of the age of 18 years, and Loo Lai, of the age \nof 16 years, arrived in the Philippine Islands on the steamship Rubi, and were \ndetained at Mariveles by the quarantine officers until the 21st day of October, \nwhen they were brought to the port of Manila. Some question arose concerning \ntheir right to enter the Philippine Islands and the board of special inquiry of \nthe port of Manila commenced an investigation for the purpose of determining \nthat question. At the conclusion of said investigation, the board found that Loo \nSing was a naturalized citizen of the Hawaiian Kingdom, prior to the ownership \nof the Hawaiian Islands by the United States, and had become a citizen of the \nUnited States upon the establishment of the United States government there and \nwas, therefore, entitled to be admitted into the Philippine Islands as an \nAmerican citizen. The said board, however, found that the three alleged sons, \nLoo Tong, Loo Gee, and Loo Lai, were not entitled to enter, for the reason that \nthey had furnished no proof sufficient to justify their claim. \n<p>From that conclusion an appeal was taken to the Collector of Customs. During \nthe pendency of the appeal, the Collector of Customs of the Philippine Islands \nsent a communication to the customs authorities at Honolulu, asking them to make \nan investigation and a report concerning the right of the said Loo Sing and his \nthree alleged children to enter the Philippine Islands. Said communication was \nduly received by the customs authorities at Honolulu, and in the month of \nDecember (December 3 and 4), 1912, an investigation was had by said customs \nauthorities. The report of said investigation was duly received by the Collector \nof Customs of the Philippine Islands. Whereupon he examined the appeal \ntheretofore made by the three sons, taking into consideration, in relation with \nthe proof taken before the board of special inquiry, the evidence adduced before \nthe customs authorities at Honolulu, and thereafter ordered a rehearing before \nthe said board of special inquiry, for the purpose of reconsidering the right of \nthe three alleged sons to enter the Philippine Islands.<\/p>\n<p>The second hearing before the board of special inquiry was commenced on \nJanuary 8, 1913, and additional proof was adduced. At the conclusion of the \nsecond hearing, the board of special inquiry, after considering all of the proof \nthat had been adduced before it, as well as the report submitted by the customs \nauthorities at Honolulu, arrived at the conclusion that two of the alleged sons, \nLoo Tong and Loo Lai, were the legitimate minor sons of Loo Sing, and were \ntherefore entitled to be admitted into the Philippine Islands. Said board \nfurther found that the proof did not show that Loo Gee was the legitimate son of \nLoo Sing, and denied his right to enter the Philippine Islands. <\/p>\n<p>From that conclusion an appeal was taken to the Collector of Customs on \nbehalf of Loo Gee. The Collector of Customs, upon a consideration of the second \nappeal, rendered his decision on the 29th day of January, 1913, and again \nconsidering the report t)f the customs authorities of Honolulu, in relation with \nthe proof taken before the board of special inquiry, affirmed the conclusions of \nthe board and refused Loo Gee the right to enter the Philippine Islands. <\/p>\n<p>Thereafter, and on the 17th day of September, 1913, the said Loo Sing, on \nbehalf of his alleged son Lob Gee, presented a petition for the writ of habeas \ncorpus in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila. The Collector of \nCustoms made a return to the order to show cause, in which he set forth all of \nthe proof taken before the board of special inquiry of Manila, as well as that \ntaken before the customs authorities in Honolulu. All of the questions were \nsubmitted to the Court of First Instance upon the record and the return made by \nthe Collector of Customs. <\/p>\n<p>After a consideration of all of the facts contained in the record, the \nHonorable A. S. Crossfield, judge, found that the customs authorities of the \nPhilippine Islands had disregarded all of the evidence before it and that the \nruling of the Insular Collector of Customs was an abuse of authority which \nshould be set aside, and granted the writ of habeas corpus and admitted the said \nLoo Gee into the Philippine Islands. From that decision the Collector of Customs \nappealed to this court and presented here a brief in support of his appeal. The \nappellee also presented a brief. <\/p>\n<p>The appellee, in his petition for the writ of habeas corpus, alleged that \nthere was no proof adduced before the board of special inquiry which showed or \ntended to show that he was not entitled to enter the Philippine Islands as the \nlegitimate son of Loo Sing. He also alleges that the ex parte investigation held \nby the customs authorities at Honolulu, without giving him an opportunity to \nrefute or explain the facts obtained by the said investigation, constituted an \nabuse of the authority and the power reposed in the said Collector of Customs. \nThe <em>rule<\/em> that the judicial department of the Government will not \ninterfere for the purpose of modifying or reversing the conclusions of the \nCollector of Customs in immigration cases, when his conclusions are based upon \n<em>some<\/em> evidence justifying them and when the parties have been given a \nfair and full hearing, is so well established that it seems unnecessary now to \ncite cases in support of it. In the present case, however, we have the question \npresented whether or not an immigrant is given a fair and full hearing when an \ninvestigation is held, concerning his right to enter, during his absence, \nwithout his knowledge or information and when he had no opportunity to hear and \nto cross-examine the witnesses presented against him. From the record and from \nthe decision of the Collector of Customs it appears clearly that the report of \nthe investigation made by the customs authorities in Honolulu influenced his \nconclusion in denying the right of Loo Gee to enter the Philippine Islands. \nNeither Loo Gee nor his alleged father were permitted to be present at Honolulu \nat the time of the investigation, nor were they permitted to refute any of the \nstatements or conclusions made by the Collector of Customs, nor to introduce \nevidence contrary to the proof adduced at the said Honolulu investigation. There \nis much proof in the record given by the witnesses before the board of special \ninquiry which seems to refute the proof found in the report made by the customs \nauthorities in Honolulu; but, inasmuch as the Collector of Customs, as well as \nthe board of special inquiry, seems to have based his conclusions almost wholly \nupon the report from Honolulu, and inasmuch as the petitioners herein were not \ngiven an opportunity to see the witnesses whose declarations were taken at \nHonolulu and to cross-examine theni and to explain their testimony or to refute \nit absolutely, we are of the opinion that a rehearing\" should be granted, upon \nthe ground that the petitioners have not had a <em>fair<\/em> and <em>full<\/em> \nhearing and that the case should be remanded to the Court of First Instance of \nthe city of Manila, with direction that an order be made returning the record to \nthe Collector of Customs of the Philippine Islands, in order that he may take \nsuch steps in the premises as he may deem wise and necessary, to the end that \nthe petitioners may have an opportunity to have a full free, and fair hearing. \nWithout any findings as to costs, it is so ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

MANILA HOTEL COMPANY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the city \nof Manila dismissing upon the merits after trial plaintiff's action to recover \ndamages alleged to have been sustained through defendant's breach of a \nstipulation to renew for a second year a written contract for the exclusive \nfive-passenger automobile privilege of the defendant hotel.\n<p>It seems that, on the 9th of November 1912, plaintiff and defendant entered \ninto a written contract by which the defendant ceded to the plaintiff the \nexclusive right to serve its patrons with five-passenger automobiles for a \nperiod of one year from the date thereof, with certain rights with respect to a \nrenewal of the contract for a second year.<\/p>\n<p>Plaintiff entered on the performance of his duties under the contract and \nsuccessfully discharged them during the first year. When about half of the first \nyear had expired, and about June, 1913, the defendant company, disregarding, as \nplaintiff claims, the terms of its agreement with him, invited proposals from \nvarious garages for its five-passenger automobile privilege for the ensuing \nyear, that is, from November, 1913, to November, 1914, the time covered by the \nsecond year of plaintiff's contract. Under these proposals various garages \ncompeted for the privilege, including that of George E. Brown, and, after \ncertain negotiations with the latter, his offer was accepted by the defendant \ncompany and a written contract made with him for the exclusive right to the \nfive-passenger automobile privilege during the year beginning November 9,1913. \nThis contract with Brown was executed some months prior to the termination of \nthe first year of plaintiff's contract.<\/p>\n<p>Upon the termination of the first year of the contract the defendant company \nhaving, as we have seen, already entered into a contract with Brown relative to \nthe matter included in plaintiff's contract for the period representing the \nsecond year thereof, refused, over plaintiff's objections and protests, to \npermit him to continue for the second year, deprived him of the privilege which \nthe contract conferred, and evicted him from the hotel where, under the terms of \nthe contract, he was entitled to have and did have an office.<br\/><br\/>This action \nwas brought to recover damages for breach of contract.<\/p>\n<p>The contract between the parties hereto contains a clause which forms the \nsubject matter of this litigation. It is as follows: \"This agreement to remain \nin effect for a period of one year from date, with preference over others of \nrenewing for a further period of one year.\"<\/p>\n<p>There are two questions involved.<\/p>\n<p>The first one is whether that portion of the agreement just quoted gave the \nplaintiff an enforceable right to renew the contract for a second year.<\/p>\n<p>The second is whether the plaintiff, even though he had that right, did, by \nhis acts and conduct, waive that right and thereby exempt the defendant from the \nliability, if any, which it incurred by its eviction of plaintiff and the \nrefusal\" to permit him to enjoy the privilege for the second year.<\/p>\n<p>As to the first question:<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the defendant company contend that the clause quoted gave the \nappellant no right to renew the contract sued upon for the second year. They \nassert that it did nothing more than give to plaintiff the right to compete with \nothers in obtaining defendant's five-passenger automobile privilege for said \nsecond year, with preference to him to be engaged over his competitors in case \nhis offer was equally profitable to the defendant hotel. They further contend \nthat the competition into which he was thus thrust did not relate exclusively to \nthe contract in which the clause is found or to the terms and conditions of that \ncontract ; but that it referred to any contract which the defendant hotel \noffered to make or could make with any person, whatever its terms and conditions \nmight be.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, plaintiff claims that the contract gave him a right to \nrenew and that the stipulation for a renewal did not contemplate other or \ndifferent terms than those embraced in the contract to be renewed and that by \nentering into the Brown contract and evicting the plaintiff from the premises \nthe defendant violated its' obligation to grant the plaintiff a renewal of his \ncontract for a second year.<\/p>\n<p>We are constrained to agree with plaintiff's contention.<\/p>\n<p>It must be remembered that the contract relating to the five-passenger \nautomobile privilege was a complete con tract, whereby the plaintiff was. \nrequired to furnish a certain number of five-passenger automobiles and to attend \nfaithfully and fully to the requirements of the patrons of the hotel, for which \nhe was to receive a stipulated compensation. The construction placed upon the \nclause by defendant deprives the plaintiff of any right or interest in that \nparticular contract or any renewal thereof and relegates him to a scramble to \nobtain <em>not the same contract for a second year but an entirely different \ncontract for one or more<\/em> years. By this contention the clause in question \nis torn from the agreement in which it was placed by the parties and made to do \nservice not with relation to the contract in which it is found but with relation \nto another contract different in every conceivable term.<\/p>\n<p>It would seem, other things being equal, that a clause in a contract should \nbe construed with reference to the contract in which it is found, and if it \naccords a privilege to one party or the other, it should be in connection with \nthe contract to which it refers. The contract in which the clause is found was, \ngenerally speaking, one whereby the plaintiff was to furnish a certain number of \nfive-passenger automobiles, attend faithfully to the needs of the patrons of the \nhotel, to continue his service for a period of one year and to receive as \ncompensation all the proceeds of the business less, say, 10 per cent to be paid \nto the defendant for the privilege. This, with other details, is the contract in \nwhich the clause is found and to which it refers. That clause was, in our \njudgment, not intended to do duty with reference to a contract, such as the \nhotel company made with Brown, already referred to, by which the latter was to \nhave the five-passenger automobile privilege of the hotel, as well as all other \nautomobile and carriage privileges, upon the payment to the hotel of a flat sum \nof, say, P10,000 annually. According to the defendant, the clause in question \nsimply concedes to plaintiff the privilege over Brown, if he desired it, of \ntaking and accepting the contract which the hotel made with Brown. In other \nwords, defendant here contends, and the court below found, that the clause in \nquestion did not confer a certain, enforceable right upon the plaintiff with \nreference to the contract in which the clause was found, but simply gave him the \npreference over others to make with the defendant company any contract which the \nlatter might be able to make with any other person. As stated in the brief of \ncounsel in the trial court the stipulation for a renewal conferred upon the \nplaintiff only the right to make \"as satisfactory an offer as any other person,\" \nand that since plaintiff failed to make as favorable an offer as did Mr. Brown, \nthat is, since plaintiff would-do no more than propose a renewal of the old \ncontract, the hotel company had a right to contract with Brown,<\/p>\n<p>Manifestly the clause \"with preference over others of renewing for a further \nperiod of one year\" was inserted for a purpose. It was intended to confer a \nright either on the plaintiff or upon the defendant. That it was not intended to \nconfer a right on the defendant is conceded. It must have been intended, \ntherefore, to do something favorable to the plaintiff. What was it?<\/p>\n<p>While it is conceded that the clause quoted confers no right on the defendant \ncompany, the latter, nevertheless, contends that it conferred no right on the \nplaintiff. Even though the clause, as claimed by defendant, gave the plaintiff a \npreference over others with respect to some other contract, a contract which \nmight be entirely distasteful to the plaintiff in, every term and which, with \nhis limited resources, he would be unable to accept at all, such preference \nwould not be a substantial right. In fact, it would be a right the effect of \nwhich would be not only problematical but as likely to be injurious as \nbeneficial. If the clause conferred no right upon either the plaintiff or the \ndefendant, then it has no meaning to which the law attaches importance. That \nthis was intended we cannot believe. We are confident that it was placed in the \ncontract for the purpose of conferring upon the plaintiff an enforceable right \nand one which related to the very contract in which it was placed. This clause \nsets out with sufficient clearness an agreement for a renewal of the contract \nfor a second year. It cannot have any other significance in language. The \ngrammatical construction of the stipulation precludes the legal construction \ngiven it by the court below. The clause \"with preference over others of renewing \nfor a further period of one year\" does not modify anything preceding it. It must \nbe construed as a separate and independent sentence whose subject is suppressed. \nShould we supply the words omitted by the draftsman, apparently with a view to \nbrevity, the stipulation would be plain; it would clearly appear that it was \nintended to be a stipulation in favor of the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>Nor is the contention made by the defendant relative to the phrase \"with \npreference over others\" sufficient to destroy that construction. It is asserted \nthat this phrase deprived the plaintiff of the right of renewing the existing \ncontract and relegated him to the barren right of accepting at the end of the \nfirst year the best terms that defendant might be able to secure from other \npersons for the exclusive concession to which the contract refers, thereby \ntransforming the stipulation for renewal in favor of the plaintiff to one in \nfavor of the defendant. As already pointed out, the grammatical structure of the \nstipulation shows both that the thing to be renewed was the agreement in force \nthe first year and that the party who possessed the right to renew was the \nplaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The construction of the phrase \"with preference over others\" \ncontended for by the defendant and found by the court below not only overthrows \nthe grammatical structure of the stipulation but nullifies the meaning of the \nessential term in the stipulation, namely, the word \"renew.\" The meaning of that \nword, wherever applied with respect to real or personal rights, is not a matter \nof discussion and, unless the stipulation to renew expressly provides for \nvariations in the terms of the contract to be renewed, the clause of renewal \naways relates to the contract in which it is found. To attribute to the words \n\"with preference over others\" a meaning that nullifies an essential word of \ncommon usage and conventional signification is to vary an elementary rule of \nconstruction. While the use of the phrase \"over others\" after the noun \n\"preference,\" which means the act of preference or the state of being preferred \nor chosen before others, is not altogether elegant English and is somewhat \nambiguous with respect to its reference, the clause succeeding it, namely, \"of \nrenewing for a further period of one year,\" relieves that phrase of so much of \nits ambiguity as to make its presence clearly unnecessary for a perfect \nunderstanding of the agreement. When one party to a contract gives the other an \nenforceable right, then certainly the one to whom the right is conceded has \npreference over all others with respect to that right, including the other party \nto the contract; and if the party conceding the right adds to the contract a \nphrase \"with preference over others\" with respect to that right, it adds nothing \nto the contract and those words may be stricken out without altering its natural \nor legal sense. Thus, in the contract before us, if the defendant company, by \nthe clause in question, conceded to the plaintiff an enforceable right, then the \nplaintiff received preference over all others with respect to that right and the \nadding of the Words \"with preference over others\" did not serve to deprive the \nplaintiff of the right thus conceded, and those words should not be so construed \nas to effect that end. They were useless and redundant and could have had no \nforce or effect without destroying the very purpose for which the clause itself \nwas inserted. If this construction were not followed, we would be obliged, as \nalready intimated, to declare that the phrase \"of renewing for a further period \nof one year\" would have no adequate significance. The construction contended for \nby the defendant wipes these words from the contract and leaves it in that \nrespect the same as if they had not been inserted. No such construction can be \npermitted, as it takes from the contract words of the most material \nsignification. If, in the construction of a contract, one of two clauses must be \neliminated, it must be that one the influence of which upon the essentials of \nthe contract is the least. As we have shown, the words \"with preference over \nothers\" are of no substantial significance. On the other hand, the phrase \nproviding for a renewal is of very great materiality and importance and carries \ninto the contract an idea which would not have been there if it had not been \nused.<\/p>\n<p>As to the second question:<\/p>\n<p>What appears to be, perhaps, the main contention of the defendant in this \ncase is that plaintiff never made a request for the renewal of the contract for \nthe second year but, instead of so doing, sought to make other and different \narrangements with the hotel and with Brown, to whom, as we have seen, the hotel \nconceded the privilege which is the subject of this action, thereby indicating \nan intention to abandon his right, if any he had, to a renewal of the contract \nfor the second year. It is asserted by counsel for the defendant that in July \nplaintiff attempted to enter into a partnership agreement with the hotel \nrelative to the privilege in question for the period covering the second year of \nplaintiff's contract, and that, failing in that, and believing that Brown would \nsecure the privilege from the hotel, he thereupon sought to make a contract with \nBrown by which he could assist him in fulfilling his contract with the hotel. It \nis even contended by defendant that plaintiff actually did enter into an \nagreement with Brown relative to that matter.<\/p>\n<p>A careful reading of the testimony in this case leads us to differ with \ncounsel for the appellee as to the real facts of the case and constrains us to \ndiffer materially from the conclusions drawn by counsel for the defendant from \nthe acts of the plaintiff as set out in the record. <\/p>\n<p>As to the facts, we may say that the evidence does not sustain the contention \nthat plaintiff entered into a contract with Brown. The proof discloses that the \nplaintiff sought to make arrangements with the hotel of a nature different from \nthose contained in the contract under consideration and also that he had \nnegotiations with Brown looking to an agreement with him whereby he might assist \nhim in handling the five-passenger automobile business under the privilege which \nit appeared the hotel would concede to him. No contract, however, wag made with \neither and the plaintiff at no time found himself under any obligation to the \ndefendant or Brown by reason of the acts which appellee makes the basis of its \nargument.<\/p>\n<p>To us the important fact is that before the plaintiff entered into \nnegotiations or made any offers with respect to the five-passenger automobile \nprivilege either with or to the defendant or Brown, the hotel had impliedly \ndenied the plaintiff's rights with respect to the contract before us, had \nrefused to recognize the clause for a renewal of the contract for a second year \nas binding upon it, and, as a result, as early as June, 1913, had, according to \nits brief in this court \"invited proposals from various garages for its \nautomobile service for the ensuing year.\" In other words, the defendant had, \nprior to the negotiations and offers of plaintiff, repudiated its contract with \nhim so far as it related to the renewal for the second year and was preparing \nitself to make a contract with any person with whom it might secure the most \nadvantageous terms.<\/p>\n<p>Not only did the defendant advertise for bids or offers concerning its \nautomobile privilege for the period embraced in the second year of the contract \nunder consideration, but sometime before the first year of that contract had \nexpired the defendant had actually made a contract with Brown by which it had \nconceded to him said privilege for the period embraced in the second year of the \nplaintiff's contract. Thus, when the first year of plaintiff's contract \nterminated, he found that the defendant had rejected its obligation under the \nrenewal clause, had let the contract to another person, and when he sought, as \nhe did seek, to continue in the performance of his contract for the second year, \ndefendant evicted him from the premises and denied him the right which he sought \nto exercise.<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that, when a person who is under an obligation to \nanother to perform certain acts upon the demand of that person, repudiates that \nobligation prior to the time when the demand for its fulfillment is necessary, \nthe person to whom that obligation runs is not required to sit down, fold his \nhands and calmly await the disaster which the violation of the obligation \nentails. We believe that, under such circumstances, he is entirely within his \nrights and, therefore, waives nothing, when he seeks other employment or the \nsame or similar employment with others, or attempts to make other arrangements \nrelative to the same subject matter even with the person or corporation which \nowed him the obligation repudiated. So long as it appears with fair clearness \nthat his purpose is to protect himself against the results of the repudiation, \nhis acts do not constitute a waiver of his rights under the obligation \nrepudiated, nor do they estop him from making a claim by reason of its breach. \nThe waiver will not be presumed; and, if the intention to waive or release is \ndenied, such waiver or release must be proved by the party alleging it by a \npreponderance of the evidence.<\/p>\n<p>The legitimate object of a demand is to enable the party upon whom it is made \nto perform his contract and discharge his liability agreeable to the nature of \nit without a suit at law; and whenever such party wholly denies the right of the \nother to assert title in himself or unqualifiedly refuses performance of the \nobligation, a demand is made useless, and therefore unnecessary, since <em>lex \nneminem cogit ad vana.<\/em> For the same reason and upon the same principle the \nfailure to make a demand before suit may be cured by proof that the defendant \ncould not have complied with the demand if it had been made; as where a person \ncontracts to assign his interest in certain lands to another within a specified \ntime upon payment of consideration therefor, and the vendor prior to the \nstipulated time assigns his interest to a stranger. In such case a request by \nthe vendee for the performance of the contract is unnecessary. The rule stated \notherwise is to the effect that where a party bound to the future performance of \na contract puts it out of his power to perform it, the other party may treat \nthis as a breach and sue him at once, having thus an immediate right of action \nfor breach of the contract by anticipation.<\/p>\n<p>It may not be amiss, perhaps, to note that the defendant company was in no \nway injured by the acts of the plaintiff complained of. There resulted no damage \ndirectly nor did the company change position to its disadvantage by reason of \nhis affirmative acts or of his neglect, if there were such, to demand a renewal \nprior to the termination of the first year under the agreement.<\/p>\n<p>It may be noted also that the plaintiff was under no obligation to defendant \nwith respect to a renewal of the contract. The obligation was wholly on the side \nof the defendant. Therefore, in doing whatever he did to obtain other \nemployment, he was not violating any obligation which he owed to the defendant \nand, therefore, gave it no legal reason for complaint. The plaintiff had a right \nto look about for a better situation and to seek to improve his condition with \nrespect to the period embraced within the second year referred to in the \ncontract. We do not believe that the contract should be construed to deny \nplaintiff the ordinary opportunities which men have for the betterment of their \ncondition, especially after the other party to the contract has repudiated it. \nEven though one is engaged in the performance of a contract which he has with \nanother, that fact does not require him to stand still and refrain from all \nattempts to improve his condition, after the termination of the contract which \nhe is engaged in performing, for fear that such activities will preclude him \nfrom enforcing obligations which the other owes' him. At the time of the \nactivities of the plaintiff complained of the time had not yet arrived when \nplaintiff was bound to exercise his option, if it may be called an option, with \nrespect to the second year referred to in the contract. Defendant was in no way \nmisled and in no way injured by plaintiff's activities.<\/p>\n<p>The remaining question relates to plaintiff's damages.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff claims his damage to be P10,800, basing that claim upon the \nprofits which he would have received if he had continued the business for the \nsecond year.<\/p>\n<p>The appellee makes no objection to this amount, the question of the amount of \ndamages not having been referred to in its brief. It is the practice of this \ncourt, in case of reversal of a judgment dismissing the complaint on the merits, \nto examine the evidence and enter or order entered the judgment which the \ninferior court should have rendered; and, where the action is for a sum of money \nor damages, to find from the evidence the amount due or the damages suffered and \nto render or order the trial court to render judgment for that amount. We assume \nthat that practice is thoroughly understood and that if appellee had had any \nobjection to urge as to the amount of damages which should be awarded to the \nplaintiff in case judgment should be found for him in this court, it would have \npresented it in its brief.<\/p>\n<p>The only damages claimed relate to profits. Articles 1106 and 1107 of the \nCivil Code read as follows: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Indemnity for losses and damages includes not only the amount of the loss \nwhich may have been suffered, but also that of the profits which the creditor \nmany have failed to realize, reserving the provisions contained in the following \narticles.<\/p>\n<p>\"The losses and damages for which a debtor in good faith is liable, are those \nforeseen or which may have been foreseen, at the time of constituting the \nobligation, and which may be a necessary consequence of its nonfulfillment.<\/p>\n<p>\"In case of fraud, the debtor shall be liable for all those which clearly may \noriginate from the nonfulfillment of the obligation.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Under these provisions we are required to determine the amount of profits \nwhich plaintiff failed to realize by reason of the refusal of defendant to \npermit him to continue under the contract for the second year and which were \nforeseen or which might have been foreseen at the time the contract was made and \nwhich were a necessary consequence of the breach. Plaintiff testified that he \nmade P11,000 profit the first year and that he would unquestionably have made a \nnet profit of P1,200 a month if he had been left to enjoy the second year of the \ncontract. There is no evidence contradicting this, and while the estimation of \nprofits lost has, in most cases, some of the elements of speculation, it is \ninherent in the nature of the subject matter and not in its manner of treatment. \nAs was said in the case of Ft. Smith &amp; W. R. Co. <em>vs<\/em>. Williams (30 \nOkla., 726):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This has ever been looked upon and treated by the courts as a vexed and \ndifficult question. It has been, and will always be, impossible to lay down any \nfixed and definite rule correctly applicable in all cases. There has never been \na rule established which was decisive and universally followed by the courts in \nall cases, but the inclination of the earlier authorities to hold that \ncontemplated profits per se were improper elements of damage has given way under \nthe riper wisdom of jurisprudence, and, instead of holding to the earlier \ninclination, the weight of authorities in modern jurisprudence either holds or \nconcedes that, where a loss of profits is not too remote or conjectural to be \nsusceptible of computation with reasonable accuracy, they are proper elements of \ndamage.<\/p>\n<p>\"This rule is recognized with approval by each and all of the following \nauthorities cited by counsel for plaintiff in error in support of his first \nproposition: Strawn <em>vs.<\/em> Cogswell (28 111., 461); Frazer <em>vs.<\/em> \nSmith (60 111., 145); Galveston H. &amp; S..A.

There is more or less inaccuracy in every action for \ndamages for breach of contract, but in order to justify a recovery in any case, \nassuming that a breach has been committed, there are two necessary elements to \nbe considered: One that a damage has been done; the other that such damage is \nthe result of the breach. The amount of the one should be computed with \nreasonable accuracy. The fact of the other must be determined with reasonable \ncertainty. A less degree of accuracy is required in the former than of certainty \nin the latter, but neither is required to be absolute or beyond conjectural \npossibilities. Where it reasonably appears that a party has been damaged, and \nthat such damage is the direct result of the breach, then a recovery is \njustified. The next step is to ascertain how much will reasonably compensate the \ninjured party. This should be computed by the plainest, easiest, and most \naccurate measure which will do justice in the premises, and if from the \nconditions in the contract, and the nature of the breach, it reasonably appears \nthat the extent or amount of damages may be more readily, easily, correctly, and \njustly ascertained by applying the loss of profits as a measure, if it is \nevident that profits were lost and the amount thereof can be calculated with \nreasonable accuracy, then such profits are the true measure tp be applied. In \nsuch cases, however, it should appear evident that profits were lost. The amount \nmay be estimated with only reasonable accuracy; but the fact that profits were \nlost should require stricter proof.

It is undisputed that the business was a very profitable one the \nfirst year and that the second year would have been more profitable than the \nfirst.

While the evidence is not as conclusive as in cases \nwhere the damages are certain and capable of accurate statement, we are \nsatisfied with its sufficiency, particularly in view of the fact that all that \ncourts may require of litigants is the production of the best evidence of which \nthe case is susceptible.<\/p>\n<p>As to whether or not the plaintiff in an action of this character may recover \nonly that portion of the profits which had accrued up to the time of bringing \nthe action, or whether he may sue for all the damages resulting from the breach \nin a single action, even though that action is begun long before the period \nduring which the profits will accrue has expired, we may say that, in our \njudgment, the weight of authority is to the effect that the plaintiff need bring \nbut one action and that he may recover the damages sustained for the whole \nperiod even though it be by anticipation.<\/p>\n<p>The principle on which the case of Pierce vs. Tennessee Coal, Iron and \nRailroad Co. (173 U. S., 1) is decided is, in our judgment, applicable to the \ncase at bar. That was a case in which the plaintiff, while employed as a \nmachinist in the defendant's coal mine in Alabama, was seriously hurt under \ncircumstances which the plaintiff claimed, and the defendant denied, rendered it \nliable to him in damages. The parties were desirous of settling and compromising \nplaintiff's claim for damages for the injuries and, after repeated negotiations, \nthey made an agreement by which the defendant was to pay to the plaintiff \nregular wages while he was disabled, to furnish him with such supplies as he \nmight choose to get from the commissary, to give him coal and wood for fuel at \nhis dwelling house and the benefit of a garden belonging to the defendant. The \nagreement was carried out by the defendant for some time and then it discharged \nthe plaintiff from its employ before his disability ceased.<\/p>\n<p>After discussing certain phases of the contract and declaring its nature and \npurpose, the court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It appears to us to be equally clear that the Circuit Court of the United \nStates erred in excluding the evidence offered by the plaintiff, in restricting \nhis damages to the wages due and unpaid at the time of the trial, and in \ndeclining to instruct the jury as he requested.<\/p>\n<p>\"Upon this point the authorities are somewhat conflicting; and there is \nlittle to be found in the decisions of this court, having any bearing upon it, \nbeyond the affirmance of the general propositions that 'in an action for a \npersonal injury the plaintiff is entitled to recover compensation, so far as it \nis susceptible of an estimate in money, for the loss and damage caused to him by \nthe defendant's negligence, including not only expenses incurred for medical \nattendance, and a reasonable sum for his pain and suffering, but also a fair \nrecompense for the loss of what he would otherwise have earned in his trade or \nprofession, and has been deprived of the capacity of earning by the wrongful act \nof the defendant,\u2019 and, 'in order to assist the jury in making such an estimate, \nstandard life and annuity tables, showing at any age the probable duration of \nlife, and the present value of a life annuity, are competent evidence' \n(Vicksburg &amp; M. Railroad Co. vs. Putnam, 118 U. S., 545, 554); and that in \nan action for breach of contract 'the amount which would have been received if \nthe contract had been kept, is the measure of damages if the contract is broken' \n(Benjamin <em>vs.<\/em> Hilliard, 23 How., 149, 167).<\/p>\n<p>\"But the recent tendency of judicial decisions in this country, in actions of \ncontract, as well as in actions of tort, has been towards allowing entire \ndamages to be recovered, once for all, in a single action, and thus avoiding the \nembarrassment and annoyance of repeated litigation. This especially appears by \nwell considered opinions in cases of agreements to furnish support or to pay \nwages, a few only of which need be referred to.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The court, after discussing Parker <em>vs.<\/em> Russell (133 Mass., 74), \nSchell vs. Plumb (55 N. Y., 592), East Tennessee V. &amp; G. R. Co. <em>vs.<\/em> \nStaub (7 Lea, 397), holding the doctrine just quoted, further said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"These cases appear to this court to rest upon sound principles, and to \nafford correct rules for the assessment of the plaintiff's damages in the case \nat bar. * * *<\/p>\n<p>\"If these facts were proved to the satisfaction of the jury, the case would \nstand thus: The defendant committed an absolute breach of the contract, at a \ntime when the plaintiff was entitled to require performance. The plaintiff was \nnot bound to wait to see if the defendant would change its decision, and take \nhim back into its service; or to resort to successive actions for damages from \ntime to time; or to leave the whole of his damages to be recovered by his \npersonal representative after his death. But he had the right to elect to treat \nthe contract as absolutely and finally broken by the defendant; to maintain this \naction, once for all, as for a total breach of the entire contract; and to \nrecover all that he would have received in the future, as well as in the past, \nif the contract had been kept. In so doing, he would simply recover the value of \nthe contract to him at the time of the breach, including all the damages, past \nor future, resulting from the total breach of the contract. The difficulty and \nUncertainty of estimating damages that the plaintiff may suffer in the future is \nno greater in this action of contract than they would have been if he had sued \nthe defendant, in an action of tort, to recover damages for the personal \ninjuries sustained in its service, instead of settling and releasing those \ndamages by the contract now sued on.<\/p>\n<p>\"In assessing the plaintiff's damages, deduction should, of course, be made \nof any sum that the plaintiff might have earned in the past or might earn in the \nfuture, as well as the amount of any loss that the defendant had sustained by \nthe loss of the plaintiff's services without the defendant's \nfault.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From the amount of damages proved in the case at bar there would have been \ndeducted, if there had been any proof to that effect, whatever profits plaintiff \nhad gained up to the time of the action or might reasonably be expected to gain \nduring the period sued for. No evidence, however, has been introduced on that \nsubject and we do not find it necessary to go into that question. We are of the \nopinion that the great weight of authority is to the effect that the opportunity \nto earn wages or profits in reduction of the damages claimed will not be \npresumed but must be affirmatively shown by the defendant.

The majority opinion admits that such profits if proven, should be \ndeducted from the amount of damages allowed by the judgment. I think that the \njudgment of the trial court having been reversed on the ground that the trial \njudge erred in his rulings as to the right of plaintiff to recover any damages \nat all, and this court having recognized plaintiff's right to recover and at the \nsame time announced the doctrine which should be applied as to the measure of \nthe damages, and the form in which proceedings should be maintained for their \nrecovery, the case should be remanded to the trial court and evidence taken as \nto the true damages which should be allowed in this action, so that judgment may \nbe rendered on proof not only as to the amount of the anticipated profits under \nthe contract, but also as to the amount, if any, which should be deducted \ntherefrom because of \"profits plaintiff had gained up to the time of the action \nor might reasonably be expected to gain during the period sued for\" \nnotwithstanding the breach of the contract.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

Foz, as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"For the reasons above expressed, the court decrees the specific performance \nby the defendant of the contract for the purchase and sale of the lands, said \ndefendant to deliver to plaintiff the land described in the complaint; said \ndefendant paying to the plaintiff the rents which he would have received for \nsaid lands described in the complaint from the 1st day of July, 1909, until full \ncompliance with this judgment; that from the P4,000 deposited in the provincial \ntreasury of Ilocos Sur there be paid to the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church of \nVigan the mortgage now due which the said church holds against the defendant, \ntogether with the costs of the action; that the balance of the said P4,000 after \nsatisfying this decree shall be paid to the said defendant.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>An appeal was taken from that judgment and, to stay execution, a bond was \ngiven with Juan Calvo and Luis Foz as sureties, in which the parties thereto \nrecognized that they were \"jointly and severally obligated to said Jose Florendo \nin the sum of two thousand pesos (P2,000) Philippine currency, for the payment \nof which well and truly to be made\" they bound themselves \"jointly and \nseverally.\" The condition of the obligation was \"that the appellant was \nobligated to the appellee in the sum of P2,000 Philippine currency, for the \nfulfillment of the judgment appealed from, in case it should be wholly or partly \naffirmed.\" <\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from was affirmed by the Supreme Court.<span class=\"style2\"><sup>[1]<\/sup><\/span><\/p>\n<p>On the 20th of May 1912, the Court of First Instance ordered the provincial \ntreasurer, in whose custody the sum of P4,000 mentioned in the judgment then \nwas, to deliver to the clerk of the court the sum of P4,000, at the same time \nauthorizing and ordering said clerk to pay to the Roman Catholic Apostolic \nChurch of Nueva Segovia, or to its representative or attorneys, the sum of \nP2,920.59, which was the amount of the mortgage held by said church against the \ndefendant Eustaquio P. Foz, together with interest thereon.<\/p>\n<p>On the 24th of June, 1912, the sheriff of Ilocos Sur moved the court for an \norder requiring the delivery to him of the balance of the P4,000, or the sum of \nP1,079.41, in part satisfaction of another judgment against said Eustaquio P. \nFoz obtained on the 7th of March, 1911, in the Court of First Instance of the \ncity of Manila. On the 28th of June, 1912, in pursuance of this motion the court \nordered its clerk to deliver to said sheriff for the purpose specified the said \nsum of P1,079.41, the balance of the said P4,000. This payment was made to the \nsheriff on the 20th of July, 1912.<\/p>\n<p>On the 22d of July, 1912, the plaintiff in this case moved the court for the \nissuance of an execution for the recovery of the other sums found by the \njudgment heretofore referred to as due and owing from the defendant to the \nplaintiff. In pursuance of this motion the court on the 31st of August, 1912, \nissued an execution to the sheriff of the city of Manila directing him to seize \ngoods and chattels of Eustaquio P. Foz for the recovery of the sum of P2,294.64. \nOn the 14th of October following, the sheriff of Manila returned the execution \n<em>nulla bona,<\/em> stating in his return that Eustaquio P. Foz had no goods or \nchattels subject to levy and sale. On the 11th of November following, the \nattorney for the plaintiff moved the court for the issuance of an execution \nagainst the property of the sureties, Juan Calvo and Luis Foz, to the extent of \nP2,000. The said sureties appeared to combat said motion, asked that the \nexecution of the judgment be sus pended and that the court declare that the \npayment of said sum of P1,079.41 to the sheriff of Ilocos Sur for the purposes \nfor which it was paid was illegal and prejudicial to the interests of the \nsureties. They also prayed that all the goods and chattels of Eustaquio P. Foz \nbe levied upon and sold for the satisfaction of the execution before their \nproperty was made subject thereto.<\/p>\n<p>The learned trial court denied these motions and ordered that execution issue \nagainst the sureties Juan Calvo and Luis Foz for the satisfaction of the \njudgment referred to, not to exceed the sum of P2,000, the penalty of the \nundertaking. This appeal is from that order.<\/p>\n<p>The appellants assign two errors. First, that \"the Court of First Instance \nerred in not declaring invalid and of no force or effect the payment of the sum \nof P1,079.41 to the sheriff of Ilocos Sur in part satisfaction of the execution \nissued by the clerk of the Court of First Instance of Manila on the 30th day of \nApril, 1912.\" Second, that \"the court erred in not declaring null and void the \nundertaking executed by Juan Calvo and Luis Foz jointly and severally with \nEustaquio P. Foz upon the ground that said Foz was insolvent at the time of and \nsince the execution of said undertaking.\"<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of the second alleged error first, we might say that we have been \ncited to no provision of law, and we know of none, which renders an appeal bond \nvoid because the appellant happens to be insolvent at the time the bond is \nexecuted. The precise purpose of a bond on appeal is to protect the appellee \nfrom the insolvency of the appellant and to assure to him the effective \nexecution of the judgment on the termination of the litigation.<\/p>\n<p>In regard to the first error assigned, the appellants argue that they bound \nthemselves to the fulfillment of the judgment ip. case it should be affirmed and \nthat said judgment contained a clause that the balance of the P4,000, after \npaying the mortgage held by the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, should be \nturned over to the appellant in the action in which said judgment was obtained; \nand that it was a breach of the condition upon which the bond was given to \npermit that sum to be turned over for the payment of another and different \njudgment. They also argue that said sum having been paid to a stranger instead \nof to the defendant and appellant, the execution in all its parts of the \njudgment appealed from was rendered impossible, the defendant was deprived of \ncertain resources which he otherwise would have had, and the plaintiff and \nappellee in this case would have collected upon his execution said sum of \nP1,079.41, thus reducing to that extent the sum which the sureties must pay. \n<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the appellants have some grievance at the manner in which the \nP1,079.41 was handled by the court when we look at the requirements of the \njudgment for the execution of which they stood guarantors. It is a grievance, \nhowever, which, in our judgment, cannot be remedied in this proceeding or on \nthis appeal, even if it be conceded that it have a remedy at all. The sureties \nbound themselves to the fulfillment of the judgment, not in those particulars in \nwhich it was favorable to the appellants, but to those in which it was favorable \nto the appellee. The appellee, if his judgment should be affirmed, was entitled \nto receive a certain sum of money, or a sum which, by a subsequent procedure, \nwas made certain. To assure him the payment of this sum, the obligation was \nincurred by the sureties on the bond. They may have had, generally speaking, \nstrong reasons to believe that in case they were obliged to pay the judgment \nthey would receive the benefit of the sum of P1,079.41, which the court had \nordered to be turned over to the defendant after the payment of the church \nmortgage. This, however, was merely an expectation, a hope rather than a right. \nThe judgment upon which that sum was paid might have taken preference over the \njudgment for the payment of which they stood surety. In that event there would \nhave been grave doubt of the efficacy of the order, if contested, that said sum \nof P1,079.41 be paid upon said judgment, as against the rights of the \njudgment-creditor upon whose judgment the sum was actually paid. To say the \nleast, the sureties took the chance of having that sum withdrawn from the \ndefendant's resources and paid upon another obligation, or of having it paid to \nFoz himself for his personal use. As a legal proposition the sureties agreed to \nsee that the judgment appealed from should be paid if affirmed, and that is all \nthat the appellee is asking of them.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against the \nappellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

I., for \nthe purpose of gaining admission, as in fact he did, owing to the deceit he \npracticed, as will be hereinafter related, to the examinations for the municipal \npolice service in the Province of Ilocos Sur, which were held in the \nmunicipality of Vigan, said province, on or about January 18, 1913, willfully, \nunlawfully, and criminally take a false oath by affirming and asserting in an \noath that he knew to be false, in an examination application which he himself \nfilled out and signed, that prior to the said date, to wit, September 10, 1912, \nhe had never been indicted, tried, or sentenced for the violation of any law, \nordinance, or regulation in any court, when he knew at the time he took that \noath and signed his examination application, as he knows at the present time, \nthat he had been twice indicted for disturbing the public peace, and for \n<em>injurias graves,<\/em> and sentenced to pay a fine and undergo imprisonment \ntherefor, by the justice of the peace court of Tayum and the Court of First \nInstance of Ilocos Sur.<\/p>\n<p>\"The defendant made the false declaration previously mentioned after he had \nsworn before Lucas Magno, notary public, authorized by law to administer oaths, \nthat he would state the truth; and said false declaration made under the oath \ntaken by the defendant, as above stated, concerned a fact of such importance \nthat without it he would not have been admitted to said examinations prescribed \nfor the municipal police service. In violation of the law. (Sec. 3, Act No. \n1697.)\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, the \nHonorable Francisco Santamaria, judge,found the defendant guilty of the crime \ncharged, and sentenced him to be imprisoned for a period of two months and to \npay a fine of P100, in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in \naccordance with the provisions of the law, and to pay the costs. The defendant \nwas further sentenced to be disqualified from holding any public office or from \ngiving testimony in any court in the Philippine Islands until such time as the \nsentence against him is reversed. From that sentence the defendant appealed to \nthis court and made the following assignments of error:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"1. The trial court erred in holding section 3 of Act No. 1697 to be \napplicable in this case.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. The trial court manifestly erred in sentencing the appellant for \nviolation of section 3 of Act No. 1697, when the prosecution did not present any \nevidence demonstrating that he had willfully and corruptly sworn or taken an \noath. <\/p>\n<p>\"3. The trial court erred in not sustaining the defense set up by the \nappellant Tupasi with reference to the construction he placed upon the fifth \nquestion of Exhibit A of the prosecution.<\/p>\n<p>\"4. The trial court erred also in holding that the words 'which he does not \nbelieve to be true,' used in Act No. 1697, are equivalent to the term 'knowingly \nused in section 31 of Act No. 1761.<\/p>\n<p>\"5. The trial court erred in not acquitting the defendant.\" It appears from \nthe record that on the 10th day of September, 1912, the defendant signed a \npetition to be permitted to take the examination for the position of municipal \npoliceman. Said petition was signed by the defendant and sworn to by him before \na notary public. Said petition contained a number of questions which the \napplicant was required to answer. Among other questions we find that No. 5 was \nas follows:<\/p>\n<p>\"Have you ever been indicted, tried, or sentenced in any court for violation \nof any law, ordinance, or regulations, or have you ever been tried or sentenced \nfor violation of regulations of the Army, Navy, or the Constabulary, in any \ncourt martial of the Army or of the Constabulary, or in any other \ncourt?\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To said question the defendant answered: \"No, sir; I cannot remember \nany.\"<\/p>\n<p>During the trial of the cause the prosecuting attorney presented Exhibits B, \nC, and D.<\/p>\n<p>Exhibit B shows that one Francisco Tupasi and others, on the 8th day of \nFebruary, 1911, had been arrested by an.order of the justice of the peace of the \nmunicipality of Tayum, Province of Ilocos Sur, and charged with disturbing the \npublic peace, were found guilty, and sentenced, on the 20th day of February, \n1911, to be imprisoned for a period of fifteen days, and each to pay a fine of \n25 <em>pesetas,<\/em> and to pay the costs.<\/p>\n<p>Exhibit C shows that Francisco Tupasi, on the 18th day of May, 1911, had been \narrested and taken before the justice of the peace of the municipality of Tayum, \nProvince of Ilocos Sur, charged with the crime of \"injurias graves,\" and was \nsentenced on the 22d day of May, 1911, to be imprisoned for a period of fifteen \ndays and to pay a fine of 75 <em>pesetas<\/em> and the costs.<\/p>\n<p>Exhibit D is the certificate of the clerk of the Court of First Instance of \nthe Province of Ilocos Sur and shows that the Honorable Dionisio Chanco, on the \n26th day of April, 1911, in an appealed case for disturbing the public peace, \nsentenced the said Francisco Tupasi and others to pay a fine of 60 \n<em>pesetas,<\/em> in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, and \nto pay the costs.<\/p>\n<p>Exhibit A was the sworn petition presented by the defendant for permission to \ntake the examination. Said petition was signed by Frank Tupasi y Molina. It was \nshown during the trial of the cause, by the admission of the defendant himself, \nthat he was the same person accused and sentenced in Exhibits B, C, and I). It \nis argued that the defendant signed said application in the name of \"Frank \nTupasi y Molina\" when he had theretofore been known as \"Francisco Tupasi,\" for \nthe purpose of avoiding identity. The defendant said that \"Francisco\" was the \nsame as \"Frank\" and that he had adopted the name of \"Frank\" instead of \n\"Francisco.\" The answers to the questions in said application were made in \nEnglish.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the first assignment of error, that the lower court \ncommitted an error in applying section 3 of Act No. 1697 to the facts in the \npresent case, it may be said that said article provides that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Any person who, having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, \nor person\", in any case in which a law of the Philippine Islands authorizes an \noath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify \ntruly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition or certificate by \nhim subscribed is true, wilfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes \nany -material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury, \nand shall be punished, etc.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Act No. 2169 of the Philippine Legislature, which is an Act to provide for \nthe reorganization, government, and inspection of municipal police of the \nmunicipalities or provinces and subprovinces organized under Act No. 83, \nprovides for the reorganization of the municipal police of the municipalities or \nprovinces and subprovinces organized under Act No. 83.<\/p>\n<p>Said Act further provides that, subject to the approval of the Secretary of \nCommerce and Police, the Director of Constabulary shall prepare general \nregulations for the good government, discipline, and inspection of the municipal \npolice, \"compliance wherewith shall be obligatory for all members of the \norganization.\"<\/p>\n<p>Said Act further provides for an examining board for the municipal police. It \nfurther provides that, subject to the approval of the Secretary of Commerce and \nPolice, the Director of Constabulary shall prepare an\/examination manual, \nprescribing, at the same time, suitable rules for the conduct of the \nexamination.<\/p>\n<p>Said Act (No. 2169) also provides for the time and place for holding said \nexaminations. <\/p>\n<p>Section 9 of said Act provides that: \"To be eligible for examination, a \ncandidate shall have the following requirements: * * * (6) Have no criminal \nrecord.\" <\/p>\n<p>In accordance with the requirements of said law, the Director of Constabulary \nprepared an examination manual, prescribing at the same time rules for \nconducting examinations, which examination manual was approved by the Secretary \nof Commerce and Police, and thereby was given the force of law. Said manual \nprescribed a form in blank, known as (Municipal Form No. 11,\" which form each \napplicant was required to fill, in order to be permitted to take said \nexamination. Said application required the applicant to swear to the facts \nstated therein. We have, therefore, a law which authorizes the administration of \nan oath in the present case.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the regulations adopted under legislative authority by a \nparticular department must be in harmony with the provisions of the law, and for \nthe sole purpose of carrying into effect its general provisions. By such \nregulations, of course, the law itself can not be extended. So long, however, as \nthe regulations relate solely to carrying into effect the provisions of the law, \nthey are valid. A violation of a regulation prescribed by an executive officer \nof the Government in conformity with and based upon a statute authorizing such \nregulation, constitutes an offense and renders the offender liable to punishment \nin accordance with the provisions of law. (United States <em>vs<\/em>. Bailey, 9 \nPet., 238, 252, 254, 256; Caha <em>vs.<\/em> United States, 152 U. S., 211, 218; \nUnited States <em>vs<\/em>. Eaton, 144 U. S., 677.)<\/p>\n<p>In the very nature of things in many cases it becomes impracticable for the \nlegislative department of the Government to provide general regulations for the \nvarious and varying details for the management of a particular department of the \nGovernment. It therefore becomes convenient for the legislative department of \nthe Government, by law, in a most general way, to provide for the conduct, \ncontrol, and management of the work of the particular department of the \nGovernment; to authorize certain persons, in charge of the management, control, \nand direction of the particular department, to adopt certain rules and \nregulations providing for the detail of the management and control of such \ndepartment. Such regulations have uniformly been held to have the force of law, \nwhenever they are found to be in consonance and in harmony with the general \npurposes and objects of the law. Many illustrations might be given. For \ninstance, the Civil Service Board is given authority to examine applicants for \nvarious positions within the Government service. The law generally provides the \nconditions in a most general way, authorizing the chief of such Bureau to \nprovide rules and regulations for the management of the conduct of examinations, \netc. The law provides that the Collector of Customs shall examine persons who \nbecome applicants to act as captains of ships for the coastwise trade, providing \nat the same time that the Collector of Customs shall establish rules and \nregulations for such examinations. Such regulations, once established and found \nto be in conformity with the general purposes of the law, are just as binding \nupon all of the parties, as if the regulations had been written in the original \nlaw itself. (United States <em>vs.<\/em> Grimaud, 220 U. S., 506; Williamson \n<em>vs.<\/em> United States, 207 U. S., 425; United States <em>vs.<\/em> United \nVerde Copper Co., 196U. S., 207.)<\/p>\n<p>By reference to Exhibit A, the application made and sworn to by the \ndefendant, we find that the oath was taken before a notary public, a person \nqualified to administer an oath, in accordance with the provisions of law.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant, in support of his first assignment of error, argues that the \npurpose of Act No. 1697 was not intended to cover cases like the present. He \nargues that said Act was an Act <em>only<\/em> authorizing the appointment of \ncommissioners, to make official investigations, fixing their powers, for the \npayment of witness fees, and for the punishment of perjury in official \ninvestigations. The same question was presented to this court in the case of \n\"United States vs. Conception (13 Phil. Rep., 424). In that case the court \ndecided against the contention of the defendant in the present case. It is true \nthat the title of said Act (No. 1697) does not seem to indicate that said law \ncontained a provision punishing the crime of perjury generally. Reading the \ntitle alone, it would seem to be a law punishing the crime of perjury in \nparticular cases. The law (Act No. 1697) is a general law. It is not a private \nor local law. In the United States the constitutions in the different States \ngenerally provide that the title of a law shall indicate the general purpose of \nthe law. There seems to be no provision in the Philippine Islands that the title \nof a general law shall contain a statement of the subject matter of the law. \nSection 5 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That no <em>private<\/em> or <em>local<\/em> bill which may be enacted into \nlaw shall embrace more than one subject, and that subject shall be expressed in \nthe title of the bill.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We held in the case of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Concepcion, <em>supra,<\/em> \nthat said Act of Congress did not apply to general laws, and that said section 3 \nwas a provision punishing the crime of perjury generally. (U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. De \nChaves, 14 Phil. Rep., 565; U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Estraiia, 16 Phil. Rep., 520; U. \nS. <em>vs<\/em>. Fonseca, 20 Phil. Rep., 191.)<\/p>\n<p>In the case of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Dumlao (R. G., No. 8721, not \nreported) this court held the defendant guilty of the crime of perjury, under \nfacts exactly analogous to those in this case, under the provisions of section 3 \nof Act No. 1697. We find no reason, either in law or in the argument of the \nappellant in the present case, to modify or reverse our conclusions in that case \n(No. 8721).<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the second assignment of error, the appellant alleged that \nthe lower court committed an error in finding that he had committed the crime of \nperjury voluntarily and corruptly. There is nothing in the record which shows \nthat he did not present to the proper authorities Exhibit A voluntarily. It is \ndifficult to understand, in view of the fact that the defendant had theretofore \nbeen convicted of two different offenses and in one of them by two courts, how \nhe could, within a few months thereafter, make a sworn statement that he \"did \nnot have a criminal record,\" unless he answered said question No. 5 in the \nmanner indicated in said application for the express purpose of deceiving the \nauthority to which said application was presented.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the third assignment of error, it may be said that the \nlanguage of question No. 5 seems to be perfectly clear. The defendant admitted \nthat he could read and understand Spanish. It is to be noted also that at the \nvery beginning of said application there are three paragraphs devoted to \ninstructions to the applicant, which he should have read and no doubt did. Said \ninstructions were sufficient to indicate to the defendant that if there were any \nquestions which he did not fully understand, he should have acquired a full \nunderstanding of the same before answering them. If there was any fault in \nunderstanding said question No. 5, it was wholly due to his own negligence.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the fourth assignment of error, the appellant contends that \nthe lower court committed an error in holding that the phrase \"which he does not \nbelieve to be true,\" found in section 3 of Act No. 1697, is equivalent to the \nword \"knowingly,\" used in other laws. The lower court cited the case of U. S. \n<em>vs.<\/em> Tin Masa (17 Phil. Rep., 463) in support of his conclusion. Said \nsection 3, in effect, provides that any person who takes an oath before a \ncompetent tribunal, officer or person, in any case in which a law of the\" \nPhilippine Islands authorizes an oath, that he will testify, etc., or that any \nwritten testimony, declaration, etc., by him subscribed is true, and thereafter \nwillfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter, \n\"which he does not believe to be true,\" is guilty of perjury. Under said \nsection, three things are necessary, in order to constitute the crime of \nperjury:<\/p>\n<p>1. The person must have taken an oath, in a case where the law authorizes an \noath, before a competent person, or a person authorized to administer an \noath;<\/p>\n<p>2. That the person, who has taken the oath will testify, declare, depose, or \ncertify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition or \ncertificate by him subscribed is<em> true<\/em>;<\/p>\n<p>3. That he willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any \nmaterial matter, \"which he does not believe to be true.\"<\/p>\n<p>It is difficult to understand how a person can state, under oath, that a fact \nis true or subscribe a document, asserting that the same is true, which he does \nnot believe to be true. If, under his oath, he declares that said facts are \ntrue, we must conclude that he believed that they were true. If, as a matter of \nfact, they were not true, and he had full knowledge of the fact that they were \nnot true, then his declaration that they were true would certainly be a sworn \nstatement that a certain fact was true which he did not believe to be true and, \ntherefore, he must have made a false statement knowingly. Without attempting to \nshow or assert that the phrase \"which he does not believe to be true\" is \nequivalent to the word \"knowingly,\" as the lower court held, we are of the \nopinion that whoever makes a statement or subscribes a document, under the \ncircumstances mentioned in said section 3, which is false and which he, at the \ntime he makes the same does not believe to be true, is guilty of the crime of \nperjury. In other words, under the circumstances mentioned in said section, if \none swears positively that a fact is true, which he does not believe to be true, \nand it turns out that it is false, he is guilty of the crime of perjury. No one \nshould swear positively that a fact is true or subscribe a document asserting \nthat the facts stated therein are true, unless he at least believes that they \nare true at the time he takes such oath or subscribes such document. It can \nscarcely be believed that the defendant in the present case believed that the \nanswer to said question No. 5 was true. He must have signed or answered said \nquestion not only believing that it was not true, but, as a matter of fact, \nsigned the same knowing that the answer was false.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the fifth assignment of error, we are of the opinion that \nthe evidence adduced during the trial of the cause clearly shows that the \ndefendant is guilty of the crime charged and therefore the sentence of the lower \ncourt should be and is hereby affirmed with costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

FILOMENA SANTIAGO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The appellant was convicted in the court below of the theft of P120 from the \ncomplaining witness Carlos Perez.\n<p>The evidence of record conclusively establishes the following summary of the \nfacts upon which appellant was convicted. On the morning of December 15, 1912, \nPerez received from one Galura, in the town of Bacolor, the sum of P150 in paper \nmoney which he undertook to deliver to Mercan &amp; Co. in Manila. He doubled \nthe bills twice into a small bundle and placed them in the watch-pocket of his \ntrousers. Galura also gave him a P2 bill to pay his railroad fare to Manila. He \narrived at the station in Bacolor in a carromata just as the train was about to \nleave for Manila, and hurried to the ticket window, at the same time drawing out \nfrom his watch-pocket the P2 bill which had been given him to buy his ticket. \nUnnoticed by him, the bundle of bills amounting to P150 dropped at his feet at \nthe moment when he drew the P2 bill from his pocket just after he stepped from \nhis carromata on to the platform, and while he was moving along the platform \ntoward the ticket window. The accused woman, who was well acquainted with Perez, \nwas passing by at that moment, picked up the bundle of bills, and hastily \nconcealing them, moved on up the platform. After Perez returned from the ticket \nwindow, to the place where his cochero had placed his baggage, having in the \nmeantime purchased his ticket and counted his change, the woman approached him \nand handed him one P20 and one P10 bill, in all P30, saying that this was the \nmoney he had dropped. Greatly surprised, Perez put his hand in his pocket, found \nit empty and asked her where the rest of the money had gone. She replied that \nthat was all she had found, and Perez then ran excitedly up and down the \nplatform looking for the lost bills. Two passengers on board the train, entire \nstrangers to the parties, who came from another town, and a third passenger who \nhad just boarded the train saw the incident from the window of the car in which \nthey were sitting. One of them, a lady named Milagros P. de Martin, tried to \ncall Perez' attention to the loss of his money as he ran toward the ticket \nwindow, but failing to do so, when he again passed her window looking for the \nbills which had not been returned to him, pointed out the woman who had picked \nup the bundle of bills and called to him that that woman had picked up his \nmoney. There was no time to give him any details, as just then the train moved \noff, and Perez, after hastily searching and researching his pockets, gave up his \nplan to go to Manila. He made some inquiries of those left at the station as to \nwhat they had seen, and learning nothing of value he went back to the owner of \nthe money arid reported his loss. He then hurried to San Fernando in search of a \nman named Siling, whom he suspected for some reason of having had something to \ndo with the disappearance of the lost bills. It does not appear whether he found \nthe man or not, but he spent the next few days in Manila looking for Mrs. \nMartin, and fortunately met her at the station, apparently on her way back to \nher home, From her he learned exactly what had occurred, and thereafter this \naction was instituted, charging the accused woman with the theft of the P120 \nwhich he lost from his pocket as above set forth. <\/p>\n<p>There does not appear to be a shadow of doubt as to the substantial accuracy \nof the facts just related; and upon those facts we are of opinion that the trial \ncourt properly convicted the accused of the crime of theft with which she was \ncharged.<\/p>\n<p>Subsection 2 of article 517 of the Penal Code provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Art. 517. The following are guilty of theft:<\/p>\n<p>\"2. Any person who, having found anything which has been lost, shall with \nknowledge of its ownership appropriate the same with intent of \ngain.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Under the facts as proven, there can be no reasonable doubt that the accused \nfound and appropriated, with intent of gain, the money lost by the complaining \nwitness, with full knowledge of its ownership.<\/p>\n<p>The accused testified that she picked up the money when she saw it fall, and \nimmediately and voluntarily handed it to Perez. Several witnesses, friends and \ncompanions of the accused, were called for the defense, who attempted to \ncorroborate her statement that she handed the money to the complaining witness \nimmediately after he dropped it, and before he went to the ticket office. But \ntheir account of the transaction is put in doubt by the marked inconsistencies \nin their testimony, and is conclusively shown to be false by the testimony of \nthe disinterested eyewitnesses on the train who saw her pick up the money, \nalthough they were apparently not in position to see just what it was that she \ngave him after he left the ticket office, she having moved away at that time \nfrom the place outside the window of the car where they were sitting.<\/p>\n<p>Not only did these witnesses, directly contradict the story of the accused as \nto the immediate return of the money, but their testimony as to the size of the \nsmall thick bundle of folded bills dropped by Perez strongly corroborates his \ntestimony as to the number of bills in the bundle; as to which indeed there \nwould be no reasonable doubt, even without this strong corroborative proof.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for appellant insists that the story of the whole incident as told by \nthe witnesses for the prosecution is put in doubt by the conduct of Perez \nhimself as the train moved away, and immediately thereafter. It appears that he \nsearched and re-searched his pockets, and, after the train left, went in search \nof a man who, as he suspected, might have something to do with the loss of his \nmoney. But it must be remembered that he did not learn the full details of the \nincident until some days afterwards, when he met Mrs. Martin, who had seen the \naccused pick up the bundle of bills, but did not have time to do more than point \nto the accused as the woman who had picked up his money, just before the train \nmoved away. Distracted with the apparently inexplicable loss of his money, what \nmore natural than that Perez should search and re-search his pockets, in the \nvain hope he might have been mistaken as to his loss. And until he learned the \nexact facts at a later day, his suspicions were naturally aroused against any \nperson who by any possibility could have anything to do with the loss of his \nmoney. The accused woman went on board immediately after handing him the two \nbills which she said were all she had found, and until he had learned all that \noccurred, he had no sufficient reason to doubt her story. The natural inference \nat that moment was that some one else had gotten the rest of the money, and that \nthe woman had told the truth when she said she had only found the two bills \nwhich she returned.<\/p>\n<p>Some attempt is made to weaken the force of Mrs. Martin's testimony by \ninviting attention to an alleged contradiction in the statement of the witnesses \nfor the prosecution as to the failure of the accused to return the money \nforthwith. One of the witnesses, who was in the car with Mrs. Martin, and saw \nthe accused pick up the money, testified that he and Mrs. Martin saw her hand \nPerez something after he left the ticket window; but he could not say whether it \nwas money or not, as by that time the woman had moved away from the window of \nthe car. He evidently saw the accused, hand the two bills to Perez, but while he \nmay well have thought that Mrs. Martin, who was sitting near him, also saw the \naccused in the act of handing something to Perez, he could not be certain that \nshe did so, unless he happened to glance toward Mrs. Martin at that moment. He \nhimself did not see distinctly what occurred, and as the accused had moved away \nfrom the window there is no reason to doubt Mr. Martin's statement that she did \nnot see the money returned. But whether Mrs. Martin did or not see the actual \nreturn of these two bills is a matter of no practical importance. Both \nprosecution and defense are agreed that she did hand him some bills, the vital \nissue being whether she did so immediately after she picked up the money dropped \nby Perez, and upon this point Mrs. Martin was in absolute agreement with the \nother disinterested witnesses for the prosecution. The whole incident was \ndiscussed by the passengers on the train after it got in motion, and if she \nherself did not see the accused hand Perez the bills after he left the ticket \noffice, she doubtless learned of that incident on the train, which may account \nfor her apparent uncertainty upon this point at the trial But however this may \nbe her evidence as to the finding and concealment of the bundle of bills dropped \nby Perez is clear and convincing, and her conduct throughout the whole \ntransaction was that of an honest and honorable disinterested witness, rendered \nhighly indignant by a contemptible theft perpetrated before her eyes. <\/p>\n<p>We have not the slightest doubt as to the truth of the story told by her and \nthe other disinterested eyewitnesses; and certainly there is nothing in the \nrecord which would justify us in disturbing the findings of the trial judge as \nto the degree of credit which should be accorded the respective witnesses of the \nprosecution and the defense.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment entered in the court below convicting and sentencing the \nappellant should therefore be affirmed, with the costs of this instance against \nher. So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C, J., Torres, Johnson,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> \nconcur.<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/div>",

The demurrer \nalleged:<\/p>\n<p>First. That the plaintiffs had no legal capacity to maintain the action.<\/p>\n<p>Second. That the facts alleged in the complaint were not sufficient to \nconstitute a cause of action.<\/p>\n<p>Third. That some of the defendants had been erroneously included as \nplaintiffs.<\/p>\n<p>Fourth. That the complaint was ambiguous, unintelligible and uncertain.<\/p>\n<p>After hearing the arguments of the respective parties, the lower court \noverruled the demurrer, to which ruling the defendants duly excepted.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants then answered the complaint, presenting a general and special \ndefense. In the special defense, the defendants alleged that they had acquired \nthe parcel of land in question by purchase from the plaintiff Petra de Guzman \nand had paid therefor the sum of P2,000.<\/p>\n<p>Upon the issues thus presented the lower court found that the parcel of land \nin question had been inherited by Petra de Guzman and the other plaintiffs from \ntheir parents, Dimas de Guzman and Felipa de los Reyes; that there had never \nbeen a partition of the parcel of land in question among the coheirs of the said \nDimas de Guzman and his wife.<\/p>\n<p>The lower court further found that Petra de Guzman had sold her undivided \ninterest in said parcel of land to the defendants and that, therefore, the \ndefendants were the owners of the one-fifth undivided part of said parcel of \nland and ordered the defendants to immediately return the possession of the land \nto the plaintiffs, as coheirs, and to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of P800 and \nthe costs.<\/p>\n<p>The lower court further ordered that after his decision became final there \nshould be a partition made between the said coowners.<\/p>\n<p>From that decision the defendants appealed to this court and made a number of \nassignments of error.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to said assignments of error, we deem it necessary only to \ndiscuss the fourth, fifth, and sixth. Said assignments of error relate to the \ntitle and ownership of the parcel of land in question. From an examination of \nthe evidence brought to this court, we find that a preponderance of the evidence \nshows the following facts to be true:<\/p>\n<p>First. That the plaintiffs are the children and grand-children of Dimas de \nGuzman and Felipa de los Reyes, his wife.<\/p>\n<p>Second. That Petra de Guzman, one of the plaintiffs, is the youngest child \nand that her parents (Dimas de Guzman and Felipa de los Reyes) continued to live \nwith her upon the parcel of land in question until the time of their death.<\/p>\n<p>Third. That prior to the death of Dimas de Guzman and Felipa de los Reyes, \nthey were the owners of other parcels of land located in the same district in \nwhich the parcel of land in question is located.<br\/><br\/>Fourth. That prior to \nthe death of Dimas de Guzman and his wife, they made a partition of all of their \nreal estate, giving to each of their children a certain parcel.<\/p>\n<p>Fifth. That the parcel of land in question was given in said partition to \nPetra de Guzman, as her share and participation in the estate of her \nparents.<\/p>\n<p>Sixth. That some time after the death of her parents, Petra de Guzman sold \nthe parcel of land in question to the defendants herein and delivered to them \nthe possession of the same.<\/p>\n<p>Seventh. That the defendants, after having purchased the said parcel of land \nfrom Petra de Guzman, went into possession of the same as owners, and have \npeaceably and quietly remained in such possession ever since.<\/p>\n<p>Eighth. At the time of the partition, by the ancestors of the plaintiffs, \neach of the heirs entered into possession of his respective share. This \npartition seems to have been mutually made and assented to by all of the \ninterested parties. No written document was made of the partition at the time, \nneither was it necessary to evidence the partition by a written document. The \nlaw did not require this division or partition of the inheritance to be reduced \nto writing. (Madamba <em>vs.<\/em> Magno, 10 Phil. Rep., 86.)<\/p>\n<p>It clearly appears that at the time of the sale of said parcel of land by \nPetra de Guzman, she was the owner and had a perfect right to sell and transfer \nthe same to the defendants, and that the defendants thereby became the owners. \nIt also appears that the other plaintiffs had no right, title, or interest in \nsaid land, as owners, nor in the possession of the same. Therefore, and without \ndiscussing the other assignments of error, the judgment of the lower court is \nhereby reversed and the defendants are hereby relieved from any liability under \nthe complaint, without any finding as to costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano,, C.

This court referred these charges and the answer of Attorney Tirona \nthereto to the Attorney-General for investigation on October 4, 1913, and his \nreport is now before us for consideration.\n<p>Catalina Cebu was appointed administratrix of the estate on August 1, 1910, \nand assumed charge thereof on August 19, 1910. There were four surviving \nchildren, Sinforosa, aged 16; Ricardo, aged 13; Trinidad, aged 7; and Ligaya, 1 \nyear old. At the time these charges were preferred, Sinforosa was married to one \nCrispulo Malia.<\/p>\n<p>On January 17, 1913, Judge Gale of the Court of First Instance ordered the \nadministratrix to present to him on or before January 21, 1913: (1) the accounts \nof her administration; (2) a detailed report of the assets of the estate with \ntheir incumbrances, if any; (3) a list of the heirs; (4) a liquidation of all \nthe <em>sociedades<\/em> in which the deceased had participated and of the \nconjugal partnership; (5) a tentative plan for the partition of the estate. The \nfollowing day, the administratrix presented her accounts, showing a balance in \nfavor of the estate for the year ending, August 18, 1911, of P78.26; for the \nyear ending August 18, 1912, a balance of P395; and for the period August 19 to \nDecember 31, 1912, of P66. On January 21, 1913, the court appointed Catalina as \nthe guardian of her minor children. The following day, January 22, a complaint \nsigned by the daughter, Sinforosa, was filed with the clerk, in which it is \nalleged that Catalina had sold and mortgaged some of the property of the estate, \nand that the income of the estate had been disposed of in some unknown manner. \nOn January 24, the administratrix asked for additional time within which to \nprepare the tentative plan of partition of the estate. On February 28, according \nto her own testimony, the administratrix filed a document in the court entitled \n\"Additional Statement of Accounts,\" in which she shows a total balance in favor \nof the estate for the period August 18, 1910, to December 31, 1912, of \nP5,806.55. On February 10, 1913, she filed another statement of accounts in the \noffice of the clerk, materially at variance with both of the former statements, \nin which a balance is due the estate for the year ending August 18, 1911, of \nP1,852.56; for the year ending August 18, 1912, P457.04, and for the period \nAugust 19 to December 31, 1912, P452.28. With this third statement of her \naccounts, she filed a motion asking that it be substituted for the other two, \nand alleging that the second statement filed on February 28 was false and that \nshe had been induced to sign it through the fraud and deceit of the respondent \nattorney. Further postponements were made, and the case finally culminated in a \ncompromise agreement between the parties, under which the assets of the estate \nwere divided. This compromise agreement is dated March 24, 1913.<\/p>\n<p>Catalina Cebu filed her complaint against the respondent attorney on \nSeptember 27, 1913. This complaint may be said to contain two charges: One that \nthe respondent attorney acted maliciously in preparing the document signed by \nthe daughter Sinforosa, in which she alleged irregularities in her mother's \nadministration of the estate; and (2) that the respondent attorney induced her, \nby means of false and fraudulent representations, to sign the \"Additional \nStatement of Accounts\" presented by her on February 28, 1913, in which she \nacknowledges that she has a balance in favor of the estate of something over \nP5,000.<\/p>\n<p>The first charge is easily disposed of. Sinforosa states that she sought the \nassistance of Tirona in his professional capacity in relation to her mother's \nmisconduct in office; that she represented to him that her mother had sold some \nof the property of the estate; and that he prepared the document in question \nupon her express solicitation, after she had refused to follow his advice of \nattempting to settle the matter amicably with her mother. This is all the \ntestimony in the record on this point. As a matter of fact, it appears that \nthere was good reason for filing the complaint, as the administratrix herself \nadmitted, during the course of the present investigation, that she had delivered \nland to one Vicente Acosta, who tilled it and paid the taxes, thus indicating \nthat the land was being improperly disposed of. It is also apparent from the \nconflicting statements of account submitted by her under dates of January 18 and \nFebruary 10, that she had not kept her accounts during her administration in the \nproper manner. The conduct of the respondent attorney in preparing the complaint \nof Sinforosa was perfectly proper.<\/p>\n<p>The second charge is based upon the document entitled \"Additional Statement \nof Accounts\" filed by the administratrix on February 28, 1913. It is admitted \nthat this document was prepared by Tirona at his house on the evening of \nFebruary 27, 1913. Sinforosa and her husband, her mother Catalina, and Andres \nVillanueva, justice of the peace of the municipality and, up to that time, a \ntrusted personal friend of Catalina, came to his house in connection with the \ndispute which had arisen between Sinforosa and her mother over the affairs of \nthe estate. It is alleged by the administratrix that she had gone there at the \nsolicitation of Sinforosa and her husband to discuss a plan for the partition of \nthe estate, and that she signed the document in question upon the \nrepresentations of the respondent attorney, believing it to be a tentative plan \nfor the partition and distribution of the estate. It is asserted by Sinforosa \nand her husband that they went there at the earnest solicitation of the \nadministratrix to endeavor to arrive at an amicable agreement regarding the \ncharges made by Sinforosa in her complaint to the court above referred to, and \nthat the additional statement of accounts was the result of a compromise \nagreement between the parties. As Attorney Tirona prepared the document in \nquestion, it is clear that if the conference was concerning the partition of the \nestate, and the administratrix signed the said document believing that it \nrelated to that matter, the charges against Tirona are serious. If, on the other \nhand, the subject of the conference was a compromise agreement concerning the \naccounts of the administratrix and the latter signed the document knowing that \nit greatly increased her liabilities to the estate, the charges are false and \nthe respondent attorney was guilty of no professional misconduct whatever.<\/p>\n<p>To show how she had been deceived, the administratrix testified that she sat \nat one end of the room, away from the other persons present, and that her \ndaughter Sinforosa, the latter's husband, Tirona, and Villanueva talked in \nSpanish, a language which she did not understand; that at the conclusion of the \nconference, Tirona prepared the document and handed it to Sinforosa, who in turn \nhanded it to her (the administratrix), saying that it was all right and that she \nshould sign it; that she stayed at the home of Villanueva that night. She did \nnot ask Villanueva what the contents of the document were that night, because \nthe hour was late when they reached Villanueva's house and everyone immediately \nretired. She did not ask him the next morning because she did not have time to \ndo so before the train left for Cavite, where she went to present the document \nto the court. Yet she stated later on in her testimony that on the morning \nfollowing the conference and before train time, she asked Villanueva about the \ndocument and he told her it was all right and that she should sign it. More than \nthis, she testified that she went over to the house of her daughter Sinforosa \nbefore train time, and asked her and her husband about it, both of whom also \ntold her that the document was all right and that she should sign it. On \narriving at the court she was on the stairway when the judge called her name, \nand the sheriff told her to hurry up. She thereupon went into the clerk's office \nwhere Teofilo Viado was acting as clerk, and asked him to affix her name to the \ndocument, which he did, and then she placed her mark on the document and hurried \ninto the courtroom. Viado did not have time to examine the document. She simply \ntold him it was all right and that she wanted to sign it.<br\/><br\/>On the other \nhand, it is perfectly clear from the record that the administratrix knew that \nher daughter was dissatisfied with her administration and the accounts presented \nby her. The administratrix herself admits that at a conference with her daughter \nat which Viado was present, she had agreed to render new accounts. This was only \na short time before the meeting on February 27 at which the statement of \naccounts was prepared by Tirona. The administratrix knew that Tirona had \nprepared the complaint submitted to the court by her daughter in which her \nadministration was seriously attacked; she knew that this document contained \nnothing relating to the partition of the estate, and that her daughter's \ngrievance did not relate to that matter at all. There is nothing to show that \nthe daughter changed her position between January 22, the date the complaint was \nfiled, and the night of February 27, when the conference at the house of Tirona \ntook place, and that she was then seeking to partition the estate. On the \ncontrary, the administratrix herself admits, as above stated, that shortly \nbefore that conference she had a talk with her daughter, as a result of which \nshe had manifested her desire to submit new accounts. It is highly improbable \nthat she went to Tirona's house on the night of February 27 with the \nunderstanding that they were to discuss the partition of the estate. That her \ndaughter was not at all satisfied with the practically negligible balance in \nfavor of the estate represented by her accounts of January 18, 1913, and that \nSinforosa had sought the services of Tirona in securing, though l&amp;gal \nchannels, an investigation of the affairs of the estate, were facts amply \nsufficient to put her on her guard in attending the conference in question. She \nnow professes complete ignorance of what the other persons who attended the \nconference were talking about, and of the contents of the document prepared \nthereat by Tirona. As administratrix of the estate, as the owner of one-half the \nassets of the estate, which consisted entirely of conjugal property, it is \nincredible that she should sit dumb in one end of the room while the others did \nall the talking in an unknown language and made arrangements for the partition \nof the assets of the estate. It is also incredible that, after all the trouble \nshe had had with these very people over her accounts, that she should leave that \nconference believing that the partition of the estate was the only matter \ndiscussed. She testified that she was endeavoring to ascertain the following \nmorning before she took the train for Cavite what the document related to. She \nasked Villanueva; she asked her daughter, and the latter's husband; and received \nan unvarying reply from each that the document was all right and that she should \nsign it. Upon the strength of this information, and fully cognizant of all her \npast troubles with her daughter over the accounts, and knowing that her \ninterests in the property were large, she appeared before Viado in the clerk's \noffice the following morning, saying to him that the document was all right, and \nrequesting that he affix her name to it. We cannot credit her, a woman in the \nfull possession of her faculties, with such childish simplicity and confidence. \nNor can we believe that Viado, accustomed to handle documents and well \nacquainted with the affairs of the estate, who, in fact, had prepared every \ndocument presented by the administratrix in reference to her administration, who \nhad shortly before endeavored to reconcile mother and daughter in reference to \nthe accounts of the estate, could have signed the administratrix' name to the \ndocument in question without making at least a superficial examination of it, \nand discovering that it was a most substantial correction of the accounts \nprepared by him and submitted by the administratrix on January 18, 1913. This \ndocument is an exceedingly simple affair and consists of barely two and one-half \ntypewritten pages. On the last page, where Viado affixed the administratrix' \nsignature, is a heading in capital letters, \"An explanation in reference to the \naccounts already presented.\" And a mere glance at any one of the pages of this \ndocument would have been sufficient to indicate its character to Viado, who had \ntaken such a large interest in the administration of the estate. The story that \nViado did not discover the nature of the document before he affixed the \nadministratrix' name to it is too improbable to be believed. If she herself knew \nthe nature of this document and if Viado also knew its contents, there is \nabsolutely no basis to her contention that Tirona falsely represented to her \nthat the document related to the partition of the estate.<\/p>\n<p>The voluminous record in that case is excellently discussed in the report of \nthe Attorney-General. We have discussed the main facts of the case. The \nremainder of the record but serves to strengthen the impression that the \nadministratrix' charges against the respondent attorney are without merit. We \nfully concur in the recommendation of the Attorney-General that the charges \nought to be dismissed. The respondent, Emiliano Tria Tirona, is therefore \nabsolved from the charges.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> \nconcur.<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/div>",

In her first account of the incident she \nstated that the promises of marriage were made \"while he was having intercourse \nwith me,\" but later on in the course of her testimony, and in reply to a \nquestion as to whether the accused had made any such promises on any other \noccasion, she said that he had also promised to marry her while they were in the \nstreet vehicle, on the way to the house of Jacinto Rodriguez.<\/p>\n<p>We do not think that a conviction of the crime of <em>estupro<\/em> \n(seduction) can be sustained on this evidence. To constitute seduction there \nmust in all cases be some sufficient promise or inducement, <em>and the woman \nmust yield because of the promise or other inducement.<\/em> If she consents \nmerely from carnal lust, and the intercourse is from mutual desire, there is no \nseduction. (43 Cent. Digest, tit. Seduction, par. 56.) She must be induced to \ndepart from the path of virtue by the use of some species of arts, persuasions, \nor wiles, which are calculated to have, and do have that effect, and which \nresult in her ultimately submitting her person to the sexual embraces of her \nseducer. (People <em>vs.<\/em> Smith, 132 Mich., 58.) The penalty prescribed in \nthe third paragraph of article 443 of the Penal Code, which defines and \npenalizes this offense, cannot be imposed unless it appears that the alleged \nseduction was accomplished \"by means of deceit.\" That is to say, of course, that \nthe penalty cannot be imposed unless it appears that the woman was induced to \nyield her body to the seducer by means of some deceit. Hence, where the deceit \nalleged is a promise of marriage, it must appear that the woman was induced to \nyield her body to the seducer by means of such promise, and that she surrendered \nher virtue in reliance upon its fulfillment. Manifestly a promise of marriage \nmade after sexual intercourse has taken place, or after the woman has yielded \nher body to the man's illicit embraces, cannot be held to have induced the woman \nto surrender her virtue. Nor can a promise of marriage made by a married man, \nwhere the woman knows that he is married before she surrenders herself, be said \nto.have induced her so to do; for m such a case it is clear that there was no \nreliance on the promise. And, indeed, it has frequently been held that in any \ncase wherein it appears that the surrender of the woman was not made in reliance \nupon a promise of marriage, a conviction of the crime of seduction cannot be \nsustained on the ground that such a promise had been made, though proof of a \npromise of marriage followed by carnal relations will generally be sufficient to \nsustain the inference that they were induced by such promise, in the absence of \naffirmative evidence to the contrary. See many cases cited under Note 80, 35 \nCyc., 1335.<\/p>\n<p>In the case at bar the evidence in support of the alleged promises of \nmarriage is neither satisfactory nor convincing ; and even if the testimony of \nthe woman in this regard be accepted as true, it raises a grave doubt as to \nwhether she was in fact induced to yield her body by means of the promises to \nwhich she testified. Upon her own testimony, the first promises of this nature \nwere made after she had voluntarily, and of her own free will, gotten into the \nstreet vehicle. No satisfactory explanation of the conduct of the young woman, \nin accompanying the accused in the street vehicle, was offered at the trial, nor \ndoes one suggest itself at this time, other than that she had already made up \nher mind to enter into illicit relations with the accused when she entered the \nvehicle. Having in mind the friendly if not amorous relations already existing \nbetween the couple; the early hour at which they met, long before the opening of \nthe factory in which they were employed; the short discussion, promptly followed \nby the calling of a street vehicle; the ready acquiescence of the young woman in \ngetting into the vehicle and driving to the house of a friend of the accused, \nwhere they were evidently expected; and all that occurred thereafter; we are \nstrongly inclined to believe that everything had been planned the night before, \nthe early hour and the place of meeting having been selected and agreed upon so \nthat the couple might consummate their amorous relations without fear of \ndiscovery by the young woman's family. But however this may have been, we think \nthat the weight of the evidence sustains a finding that the intercourse between \nthe couple was induced by niutual desire, and that she had made up her mind to \nsurrender herself to her lover before she got into the vehicle, and before the \nalleged promises were made by him, if indeed it be a fact that he made any such \npromises.<\/p>\n<p>There is evidence in the record to the effect that She knew the accused was a \nmarried man, long before they had their illicit relations, and this evidence, \nthough hardly sufficient to sustain an affirmative finding on this point, tends\" \nto confirm us in our doubt of the truth of her statement that she was induced to \nyield her virtue to the accused by the alleged promises of marriage.<\/p>\n<p>Let judgment be entered reversing the judgment entered in the court below, \nand acquitting the defendant and appellant of the offense with which he is \ncharged in the information, with the costs in both instances <em>de \nofflcio.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

I., the \naforesaid accused did then and there, willfully, maliciously, and feloniously \nhave sexual intercourse with, and did lie with, and carnally know a woman, \nIsabel de la Cruz, under 12 years of age, in the following manner, to wit: the \naforesaid accused is the stepfather of the aforesaid Isabel de la Cruz and \nduring the aforesaid period was the legal guardian of said Isabel de la Cruz; \nthat by threats and corporal punishment upon said Isabel de la Cruz, the \naforesaid accused, Antonio Javier Dichao, had sexual intercourse with and did \nlie with and carnally know said Isabel de la Cruz; as a result whereof the said \nIsabel de la Cruz gave birth on August 5, 1912, to a child. All contrary to \nlaw.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The demurrer alleged:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That the facts therein set forth and contained do not constitute a public \noffense.<\/p>\n<p>\"That the said criminal complaint does not conform substantially to the \nprescribed form.<br\/><br\/>\"That said complaint is vague and \nambiguous.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the order appealed from must be affirmed. The \nallegations of an information should, if possible, be sufficiently explicit and \ncertain as to time to inform the defendant of the date on which the criminal act \nis alleged to have been committed. Unless the accused is informed of the day, or \nabout the day, he may be, to an extent, deprived of the opportunity to defend \nhimself.<\/p>\n<p>While section 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that \"except when \ntime is a material ingredient of an offense, the precise time of commission need \nnot be stated in a complaint or information, but the act may be alleged to have \nbeen committed at any time before the filing thereof,\" this does not mean that \nthe prosecuting officer may be careless about fixing the date of the alleged \ncrime, or that he may omit the date altogether, or that he may make the \nallegation so indefinite as to amount to the same thing. Where the exact date \ncannot be fixed, or where the prosecuting officer is not thoroughly satisfied \nthat he can prove a precise date, he should allege in the information that the \ncrime was committed on <em>or about<\/em> a date named. Under such an allegation \nhe is not required to prove any precise date but may prove any date which is not \nso remote as to surprise and prejudice the defendant. In case of surprise the \ncourt may allow an amendment of the information as to time and an adjournment to \nthe accused, if necessary, to meet the amendment.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of United States <em>vs.<\/em> De Castro (2 Phil Rep., 616), the \ninformation demurred to was as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The undersigned provincial fiscal accuses the defendant of the crime of \nbribery, committed as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\"That as municipal president of the town, in consideration of gifts of money, \nhe permitted opium joints and gambling houses. This contrary to the \nlaw.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Among the many defects of this information the court. pointed out the \nfollowing:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The complaint is also defective in not stating the time at which the offense \noccurred. While it is not necessary, unless time is a material ingredient of the \noffense, that the precise time of the commission of the offense should be \nstated, still the act should be alleged to have been committed at some time \nbefore the filing of the complaint.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The decisions in the case of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Enriquez (1 Phil. \nRep., 179), and United States vs. Cardona (1 Phil. Rep., 381), are not in \nconflict with the doctrine herein laid down, nor with the case of United States \n<em>vs. <\/em>De Castro from which the above quotation is made. In the first case \nthe information alleged that the estafa complained of was committed on the 20th \nof November 1897. A demurrer was filed to the information on statutory grounds. \nIt was over ruled and the defendant put upon trial. He was convicted and \nappealed to this court, bringing up on that appeal the questions arising on the \norder overruling the demurrer as well as on the merits. It is clear that the \ndemurrer did not raise, so far as the information is concerned, the question of \ntime, as in the case at bar, as the precise date upon which the crime was \nalleged to have been committed was set out in the information. The question \npresented to the Supreme Court was, therefore, not whether the information \nalleged the time with sufficient certainty. The question in that case was \nwhether the allegations of the complaint sufficiently notified the defendant \"of \nthe transaction from which it is claimed the crime results, so that he can \nprepare his defense.\" The discussion in that case turned on whether the \ndefendant, after reading the complaint, was, able to tell \"to what acts of his \ndone in the past the complaint refers.\" In determining that question the court \ndiscussed, among other things, the allegation with reference to the time when \nthe estafa was committed. In that connection it was said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In this complaint the estafa is alleged to have been committed on November \n20, 1897. Time, however, was not a material ingredient in the offense of estafa \nhere charged, and under the provisions of article 7 of General Orders, No. 58, \nthat date need not have been alleged.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>After discussing the various elements of an information charging estafa \nnecessary to identify the act which constitutes the crime, thereby notifying the \ndefendant of the precise act of his complained of, the court concluded: \"It is \nplain that the complaint did not restrict the Government to proof of any defined \nspecific transaction, and consequently that the defendant had no notice of the \ntransaction which was to be investigated.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the Cardona case the theft of a carabao was alleged in the information to \nhave taken place on the 25th of March of a certain year. The evidence introduced \nshowed that the crime was committed on the 5th or 6th of March of the same year. \nThe defendant in his brief claimed that the evidence introduced should have been \nrestricted to the date mentioned in the information, or the 25th of March.<\/p>\n<p>The court in response to this contention said: \"The testimony as to the \nwhereabouts of the defendant on March 25 was unimportant, as the evidence shows \nthe robbery was committed about the 5th or 6th of March. The defendant in his \nbrief claims that the evidence should be restricted to the date mentioned in the \ncomplaint, which was the 25th of March. In this case, however, the date was not \na material ingredient of the offense, and under the provisions of section 7 of \nGeneral Orders, No. 58, the Government was not limited in its proof to the date \nstated therein.\"<\/p>\n<p>In these two cases, therefore, different questions are presented from those \nfound in the case before us. In the first case the question of time as alleged \nin the information was discussed in an incidental way for the sole purpose of \ndetermining whether it of itself, or in connection with the other allegations, \nsufficiently identified the transaction which it was claimed constituted the \nestafa, so as to notify the defendant of the transaction referred to, the other \nallegations of the information not being sufficient of themselves to do so. In \nthe Cardona case the question was raised by demurrer. The allegation in the \ninformation as to the time when the crime was committed was definite and \ncertain. The only question raised on the appeal related to the alleged variance \nbetween the date of the crime as alleged in the information and that proved on \nthe trial. In that case, as we have seen, the court said that, the time alleged \nnot being, under section 7, a material ingredient of the offense, it did not \nhave to be proved as laid. It did not hold that, if it had appeared to the trial \ncourt, on the trial, that the variance between the allegation of the information \nand the proof on the trial had been such as to surprise the defendant and \nprejudice him in his defense, the court would not have been authorized to amend \nthe information and to grant an adjournment, if necessary, to give the defendant \nan opportunity to meet the charge as amended.<\/p>\n<p>The same remarks apply to the case of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Arcos (11 \nPhil. Rep., 555), where the information alleged \"that between the 2d and the \n15th of August, 1906,\" the accused committed the crime described therein; and \nthe case of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Smith (3 Phil. Rep., 20), in which the \ninformation charged \"that the accused, in the month of December last,\" committed \nthe crime therein set forth.<br\/><br\/>The question whether the allegations of the \ninformation are sufficiently definite as to time and the question which arises \non a variance between the allegations and the proof are different in nature and \nlegal effect, and are decided on different principles.<br\/><br\/>In the case before \nus the statement of the time when the crime is alleged to have been committed is \nso indefinite and uncertain that it does not give the accused the Information \nrequired by law. To allege in an information that the accused committed rape on \na certain girl between October, 1910, and August, 1912, is too indefinite to \ngive the accused an opportunity to prepare his defense, and that indefiniteness \nis not cured by setting out the date when a child was born as a result of such \ncrime. Section 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not warrant such \npleading. Its purpose is to permit the allegation of a date of the commission of \nthe crime as near to the actual date as the information of the prosecuting \nofficer will permit, and when that has been done any date may be proved which \ndoes not surprise and substantially prejudice the defense. It does not authorize \nthe total omission of a date or such an indefinite allegation with reference \nthereto as amounts to the same thing.<\/p>\n<p>As before intimated, we are not to be understood as saying that a variance \nbetween the date of the commission of the crime as alleged in the information \nand that as proved on the trial warrants necessarily the acquittal of the \naccused. The result of what we intend to say is that, if such a variance occurs \nand it is shown to the trial court that the defendant is surprised thereby, and \nthat, by reason of that surprise, he is unable to defend himself properly, the \ncourt may, in the exercise of sound discretion based on all the circumstances, \norder the information amended so as to set forth the correct date and may grant \nan adjournment for such a length of time as will enable the defendant to prepare \nhimself to meet the variance in date which was the cause of his surprise.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, J.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><em>Carson<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur in the result.<\/p>\n<p><em>Order affirmed; demurrer sustained.<br\/><\/em><\/p><\/div>",

Santos, \nhad a talk with the other defendant, Juan Bautista; between them they concocted \na plan and then he proposed marriage to the girl. She agreed and was told to \ncome to a house, No. 104 Calle Isaac Peral, in Ermita. The girl left the school \nshe was attending (Meisic Intermediate) to keep the engagement, and there Juan \nBautista, under the name of Aniceto de Castro, a fictitious name, made out that \nhe was a Protestant minister and before two women who pretended to be witnesses \nhe simulated the performance of a marriage ceremony. Afterwards he certified, \nissuing the suitable document, that Adel Hernandez and Elena M. Santos \"were \nlegally united in holy matrimony by me\" (says Bautista) \"in the presence of \nMaxima Rambel and Manuela Agustin.\" Bautista also certified, over the name of \n\"Aniceto de Castro, Protestant minister,\" that \"the contracting parties were of \nthe age fixed by the law for contracting it.\" (Exhibit A.) In the certificate \nthe age of the girl was set down as 20 years when she was only 15.\n<p>After the ceremony had been performed, Elena M. Santos returned to her \nparents' house and did not join Adel Hernandez. According to her, she went on \nthus for several months. Both before and after the ceremony in Calle Isaac \nPeral, Adel Hernandez visited her in her house as a teacher and as such was \nreceived by the girl's mother. But during the lesson one afternoon, her mother \ncaught them in dalliance and scolded her daughter, so that the latter felt \ncompelled to declare that they were married, showing Exhibit A.<\/p>\n<p>Convinced that they were married, the mother received Adel Hernandez in her \nhouse, and Adel Hernandez and Elena M. Santos lived therein as a married couple. \nSo they continued for two years, but Elena did not conceive of Adel nor did they \nhave any offspring. But on March 1, 1912, Adel Hernandez told Elena that he was \ngoing to enter a college in Calle Almansa to continue his studies. Elena went to \nvisit him in said college twice, but the second time she did not find him there. \nHe had gone to the provinces.<\/p>\n<p>He returned from the provinces and Elena, accompanied by her mother, had an \ninterview with him and finally made an agreement of separation before a lawyer \nwho drew up the grounds therefor, which were signed by both of them in a \nnotarial instrument in the presence of two witnesses; but when the lawyer saw \nExhibit A he then learned that it was not a genuine but a simulated marriage. \nThe matter having been reported to the secret service, the assistant chief \nthereof, George W. Marshall, testified in this case that on July 1,1913, he \nconducted the investigation regarding the false marriage certificate and Adel \nHernandez told him that he had,in fact taken Elena on January 31, 1909, to the \nhouse at No. 104 Calle Isaac Peral before Juan Bautista, and when asked why he \nhad not taken her to a real minister of some religion to get married, he replied \nthat Elena's parents were forcing him by threats to marry her, and what he did \nwas to reach an understanding with a friend of his, Juan Bautista, in order to \nmake it appear that he had got married; he did not apply to a real minister of \nreligion, because his parents had not given their consent to his marriage with \nthe girl; that he had lived with her some six months; that that house, No. 104 \nCalle Isaac Peral, belonged to his women frienda who figure as witnesses in \nExhibit A. With reference to Juan Bautista, Marshall stated that he was examined \nby him, Marshall, on the afternoon of the same day, July 1, 1913, regarding the \ndocument Exhibit A, and Bautista told him that he had written it at the request \nof Adel Hernandez, who \"asked him to make out this document so that he might \nhave carnal intercourse with that girl;\" that he signed \"Aniceto de. Castro, \nProtestant minister,\" because his friend Adel Hernandez begged him to make out \nthe document so that, as has been said, \"he might have complete liberty with \nthat woman\" and to put down everything he might wish.<\/p>\n<p>Adriano Herrera, who acted as interpreter in these declarations, corroborated \nthem and added that \"Adel Hernandez declared the document to be false, and that \nhe had made it out as such solely in order to deceive the injured girl,\" and \nthat Juan Bautista declared that he was the author of the document and had made \nit out in order to please his intimate friend Adel Hernandez, \"so that the \nlatter might exercise complete liberty over Elena M. Santos by demonstrating \nthat they were joined in marriage.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hence the criminal complaint filed on July 3, 1913, drawn up in these terms: \nThat Adel Hernandez,,by means of false promises of marriage and availing himself \nof a simulated ceremony, seduced Elena Miclat Santos, a virgin over 12 and under \n23 years, and succeeded in having carnal intercourse and in living in marital \nrelations with her; that in the commission of this crime, Juan Bautista, \nconspiring ariti confederating With Adel Hernandez, took part as a principal \nthrough acts of cooperation without which the crime could not have been \nconsummated, simulating and pretending to be a Protestant and a minister \nauthorized to perform marriage cerenionies, and simulating that he was \nperforming a marriage ceremony between said Adel Hernandez and Elena Miclat \nSantos in order thus the more easily to deceive said injured girl and cause her \nto live in marital relations; as she in fact did, with the defendant Adel \nHernandez.<\/p>\n<p>The Court of First Instance of the city of Manila sentenced Adel Hernandez, \nas guilty of seduction, to four months of <em>arresto mayor<\/em> to pay one-half \nof the costs of the trial, to :endow the injured girl with the sum of P500 \nPhilippine currency, or in case of insolvency to the equivalent subsidiary \nimprisonment, and to recognize and maintain the offspring in due time, if there \nwere any. It sentenced Juan Bautista, as accomplice of the foregoing convict, to \na fine of 325 pesetas, or in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary \nimprisonment according to law, and to pay the other half of the costs. Both \ndefendants appealed.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing they allege, with respect to procedure, is that the lower \ncourt erred in denying their petition for the transfer of the hearing in the \ncase to another day. This ground of error cannot be sustained. The right of the \naccused, after their plea, is to request a period of two days at least, in order \nto prepare their defense. They pleaded \"not guilty,\" according to the record of \nthe case, on July 7, 1913. On the 15th next subsequent, they acknowledged \nsummons to appear for trial, which was to take place on the 22d. They had \nsufficient time to prepare their evidence, and they did not request any time to \nprepare their defense until the trial had actually commenced.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to the merits of the case, it is contended that it is erroneous \nto affirm that the accused Adel Hernandez committed seduction on the person of \nElena M. Santos. But there is nothing clearer than that this defendant, by means \nof deception, succeeded in enjoying the girl\u2014the fact is evident not only from \nthe testimony of witnesses, but also from documents demonstrating the deception \nand by facts not denied or controverted at the trial by the defendant himself, \nthat he had enjoyed the girl by living in marital relations with her only when \nher mother was informed from the false certificate of marriage, issued by a \npretended Protestant minister, that they were married.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the responsibility of the defendants, the part of \naccomplice cannot be attributed to Juan Bautista; for he was a principal; it was \nreally he who supplied the essential element of deception without which there \nwould not have existed in the present case the crime of seduction, \"cooperating \nin the commission 6i the act by another act without which it would not have been \naccomplished.\" (Penal Code, art. 13, No. 3.)<\/p>\n<p>But furthermore, as the prosecuting attorney remarks in this instance, he \ncooperated in the commission of the act by an act that in itself constitutes \nanother crime. He is thus really on a par with one who cooperates in the \ncommission of a fraud by means of the falsification of a document which in \nitself is another crime. The law (Penal Code, art. 328) says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Anyone who, without legal right or legitimate cause, shall perform acts \nproperly pertaining to any person in authority or a public officer, assuming an \nofficial character, shall be punished with the penalty of <em>prision \ncorrecciona<\/em>l in its minimum and medium degree.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Without legal right Juan Bautista performed an act properly pertaining to a \nperson in authority, assuming the official character of a minister of a \nreligious sect in order to legalize a marriage, and issuing a certificate, \nsigned moreover, with a false name under the predication, in an additional \nsignature, of being a Protestant minister. The crime charged in the information \nis, therefore, the complex one of seduction by means of usurpation of functions \nHernandez was likewise a coprincipal by inducement to this crime actually \ncommitted by Bautista. Marshall said that it appeared from his investigation \nthat Bautista made out the marriage certificate at the instance of an intimate \nfriend of his called Adel Hernandez, and that the latter admitted that he had \nmade that request because he wanted to live with a female cousin of his\u2014-\"he \nreached an understanding with an intimate friend of his called Juan Bautista, in \norder to make out this document, so as to make it appear that he had got \nmarried\" (p. 29).\"I acceded to this request,\" said Bautista in his turn, \"and I \nmade out the document; the reason was because this friend of mine, Adel \nHernandez, begged me to make out the document so that he might have complete \nliberty with that woman and he asked me to put down everything I might \nwish.\"<\/p>\n<p>Adriano Herrera, testified that Adel Hernandez stated, as the previous \nwitness has said, that the document was false and that<em> he had made it out \nsolely<\/em> as such in order to deceive the injured girl; and that Juan Bautista \nstated that he made out this document only in order to please Adel IJernandez \nwho had told him of his desire to possess Elena M. Santos.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Those who directly force or induce others to commit a crime are considered \nas principals.\" (Penal Code, art. 13.)<\/p>\n<p>\"Inducement exists if the <em>compact,<\/em> the command, or the advice is of \nsuch a nature that without its concurrence the crime would not have been \ncommitted.\" (Decision of December 2, 1902.)<\/p>\n<p>\"Fixing of individual responsibility is only proper when between the \nproposals and the acts of each defendant there is the necessary independence for \nweighing them separately, not when there exist unity of action and mutual \nassistance.\"(Decision of October 4, 1901.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This being so, according to article 89 of the Penal Code, only the penalty \nfor the more serious crime will be imposed, to be applied in its maximum degree, \nwhich, in this case, is the penalty for the crime of usurpation of functions\u2014 \nthat is, the maximum degree of <em>prision correccional<\/em> in its minimum and \nmedium degrees\u2014-two.years eleven months and eleven days to four years and two \nmonths.<\/p>\n<p>Both the trial court and the prosecuting attorney in this instance agree that \nthe defendant Adel Hernandez must recognize and support the offspring if in due \ntime any should be had* But Elena M. Santos, the injured girl, testified in \nthese words:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. How long did you and Adel live together in your mother's house?-\u2014A. Over \ntwo years.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Did Adel Hernandez live there, sleep there, and also eat there?-\u2014A. Yes, \nsir. <\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Did you live a life of complete marital relations?\u2014 Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Were you ever pregnant ?\u2014A. No, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. So you haven't any offspring?\u2014A. No, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. When did you and Adel separate?\u2014A. The year 1912; he asked my permission \nto enter a college in order to finish his course of study. I went to the college \ntwice, and the second time I went I didn't find him any more.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. And since then he hasn't returned to your house?\u2014<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A. No, sir.\" (p. 24.)<\/p>\n<p>This admitted, there is no ground for decreeing the forcible recognition of \nthe offspring that in the year 1912 or since July 3, 1913, the date of the \ncomplaint, the injured girl could or might have had.<\/p>\n<p>On August 4 last Juan Bautista withdrew his appeal and his withdrawal was \nentered on the record on the 6th next following. The appeal actually pending is \nsolely that of Adel Hernandez.<\/p>\n<p>On the foregoing grounds, Adel Hernandez is sentenced to two years eleven \nmonths and eleven days of prision correccional, to endow the injured girl with \nP500 Philippine currency, and to pay one-half of the costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.<\/em>, \nconcur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

ANASTASIO BRAGAT AND VISITACION ESMERO, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">In our decision filed March 30, 1914,<span class=\"style1\"><sup>[1]<\/sup><\/span> \nwe affirmed the judgment of the trial court convicting and sentencing the \nappellants in this case. In that decision we held that all the substantial \ncontentions of counsel for appellants had been decided adversely in the case of \nthe United States <em>vs.<\/em> Hernandez (14 Phil. Rep., 638) and the cases \ntherein cited.\n<p>The record is now before us upon a motion for rehearing, wherein counsel \ninsists that we erred in affirming the judgment of the court below because it \nappears from the record that the fiscal failed to call certain witnesses, \nwaiving his right to do so, although they had been duly cited by him to appear \nand testify at the trial. In support of his contention counsel relies on our \nruling in the case of the United States <em>vs.<\/em> Tacubanza (18 Phil. Rep., \n436). In that case, wherein the accused were charged with rape, we held \nthat:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When the prosecution has at its disposal two disinterested witnesses to the \nalleged crime and fails to produce them at the trial, such failure, although not \nfatal, seriously weakens the case against the accused and, in the absence of the \ntestimony of such witnesses, the other evidence, being interested and \nprejudiced, is not sufficient to establish guilt and the accused must be \ndischarged.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the case at bar, however, the facts in question were conclusively \nestablished by the witnesses called at the trial, as we observed in the opinion \nalready entered, and the failure to call additional witnesses to testify as to \nfacts already established beyond a reasonable doubt does not and cannot sustain \nthe contentions of counsel in support of their assignment of error.<\/p>\n<p>The question as to the number of witnesses to be called to testify for the \nprosecution is one which, in the very nature of things, must be left largely to \nthe sound discretion of the prosecuting officer conducting the proceedings. It \nis, of course, his duty to call all the available witnesses as to material facts \nwho may be necessary to establish such facts beyond a reasonable doubt. But when \nhe is satisfied that he has done so he is not required to waste the time and \nattention of the court by calling other witnesses whose testimony will be merely \ncumulative, or, from the very nature of the case, cannot add anything to the \nconclusiveness of the proof as to the existence or nonexistence of the fact he \nis seeking to prove. Cases may and do arise in which scores or hundreds of \npersons might be called upon to testify as to certain disputed facts, such as \nthe location of a street, the distance between certain places, and the like. In \nsuch cases it is the duty of the fiscal to call to the witness stand only such \nwitnesses as may be necessary to establish the disputed fact beyond a reasonable \ndoubt. Having done so, the facts thus proven will not be put in doubt by the \nomission to call additional witnesses to the facts thus indisputably \nestablished. It is only in cases such as that of the United States <em>vs.<\/em> \nTacubanza (<em>supra<\/em>), wherein the evidence actually offered is not, for \nsome reason, wholly satisfactory, that the failure to call other disinterested \nand available witnesses is to be taken into consideration as weakening the case \nfor the prosecution.<\/p>\n<p>It will be observed that in the former case (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Tacubanza, \n<em>supra<\/em>), we were careful to say that the failure to call available \ndisinterested witnesses is not necessarily \"fatal.\" Where, as in that case, the \nevidence relied upon by the prosecution was \"interested and prejudiced,\" and the \nvery nature of the case is such that to avoid possibility of error, all \navailable witnesses should be called in support of the facts relied upon by \neither party, the unexplained failure to call such witnesses naturally raises a \nquestion as to the motives of the party who is, responsible for the omission. \nBut such questions do not necessarily arise where the facts are not seriously in \ndispute, or where they are conclusively established by unimpeachable testimony \nor by such a decisive preponderance of the evidence as to leave no reasonable \nground for doubt in the mind of the court.<\/p>\n<p>In the case at bar the evidence of record conclusively establishes the \nmaterial facts upon which the judgment of conviction was pronounced by the court \nbelow.<\/p>\n<p>This motion should therefore be, and is hereby, denied.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

WORTHINGTON, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This defendant was charged with the crime of frustrated homicide. The \ncomplaint alleged:\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That on or about the 5th day of February, 1914, in the city of Manila, \nPhilippine Islands, and in the night time, the said Jesse P. Worthington being \nthen and there a duly appointed, qualified, and acting police officer of the \nsaid city of Manila, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, \nwith the intent to kill and armed With a deadly weapon, to wit, a revolver, \nwhich then and there was loaded with cartridges, gunpowder, and leaden bullets, \nshoot off and discharge at and upon Enrique Ayerdi, Lino Eguia de Dios, Jose \nGarcia Margenant, Manuel Llorca, W. H. Williams, and Leon Hernandez, then and \nthere occupying an automobile, thereby, and by thus striking one of the \noccupants of the said automobile, to wit, Leon Hernandez, with one of the said \nleaden bullets, inflicting on the left forearm a wound; the said Jesse P. \nWorthington performing all of the acts of execution which should have produced \nthe1 crime of homicide as their consequences, but which, nevertheless, did not \nconstitute it, by reason of causes independent of the will of the said Jesse P. \nWorthington. Contrary to law.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable Richard Campbell, judge, found the \ndefendant guilty of the crime charged in the complaint and sentenced him to be \nimprisoned for a period of six years and one day, to suffer the accessory \npenalties provided for by law, and to pay the costs. From that sentence the \ndefendant appealed to this court. In this court the defendant made the following \nassignments of error:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"First. The court erred in holding that the evidence was sufficient to prove \nthe defendant guilty of the crime of frustrated homicide. Second. The court \nerred in finding the defendant guilty of the crime of frustrated homicide. \nThird. The court erred in failing to find that the defendant was exempt from \ncriminal liability by reason of the fact that he acted in defense of his \nperson.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Said assignments of error present a question of fact only and may therefore \nbe discussed together. <\/p>\n<p>From an examination of the evidence brought to this court we find that the \nfollowing facts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014in fact, except for a few \ncontradictions, they are practically admitted by the witnesses both for the \nplaintiff and the defense:<\/p>\n<p>First. That the defendant, Jesse P. Worthington, on the night of the 5th day \nof February, 1914, accompanied by two Filipino women, whose names were Teoflsta \nBeray and Felisa Marabibe, went in a calesa to a dance hall located in the \nbarrio of Maypajo, a suburb of the city of Manila, with the admitted purpose of \nenjoying a few dances, and remained there until about 10.30 p. m. <\/p>\n<p>Second. That the defendant, Jesse P. Worthington, was on the day in question \na policeman, duly appointed and acting in the city of Manila.<\/p>\n<p>Third. That the defendant and the said Teofista Beray, upon arriving at the \ndance hall entered and took some part in the dancing that was going on in said \nhall.<\/p>\n<p>Fourth. That later, on the same evening, and before the defendant and his two \nFilipino women companions left the dance hall, W. H. Williams, a clerk in the \nemploy of the Executive Bureau of the Insular Government, Enrique Ayerdi, Manuel \nLlorca, Lino Eguia, Jose Garcia, and Leon Hernandez, the injured person, arrived \nat the dance hall in an automobile. The said Leon Hernandez was acting as \nchauffeur of the automobile.<\/p>\n<p>Fifth. That after said automobile party arrived at the dance hall, all of \nthem, except perhaps Lino Eguia, entered the dance hall and one or more of them \nengaged in dancing with the said Teofista Beray. <\/p>\n<p>Sixth. That after the said Teofista Beray had been engaged in dancing for \nsome time, she told the defendant that she wanted to go home. During the time \nthe defendant had remained in the dance hall he evidently had a talk with a \nsailor, and the sailor suggested that they should hire an automobile, evidently \nfor the purpose of taking the two girls for a ride. The defendant went outside \nthe dance hall and spoke to one of the automobile party who had remained in the \nautomobile, concerning the hiring of it, when he was informed that the \nautomobile was not for hire.<\/p>\n<p>Seventh. Later and almost immediately after the attempt of the defendant to \nhire the automobile, he and his two women companions got into their calesa and \nstarted on their return to Manila. Almost immediately Williams and his \ncompanions also started for Manila in the automobile, following the calesa \noccupied by the defendant and his companions.<\/p>\n<p>Eighth, The defendant and his companions had gone but a short distance when \nhe ordered the calesa to stop. Evidently the said Teofista Beray had told him \nsomething concerning a remark or remarks made by one of the occupants of the \nautomobile concerning him. The defendant got out of the calesa and went to the \nautomobile and after some conversation, the exact import of which does not \nappear of record, offered, as he says, to settle their differences there; in \nother words, it appears that the defendant offered to fight the occupants of the \nautomobile.<\/p>\n<p>Ninth. The defendant again returned to his calesa and started on his way in \nthe direction of Manila, being followed by the automobile.<\/p>\n<p>Tenth. At some point between the starting place at Maypajo and the city of \nManila, the defendant, as he admits, fired four shots with a revolver, which he \nwas then carrying, in the direction of the automobile. He asserts that he fired \nall of the shots but one at the front tires of the automobile and that the \nfourth shot was fired at the engine of said automobile. The proof shows that one \nof the shots entered the arm of the chauffeur, Leon Hernandez, and caused a \nserious injury. The defendant asserts that he fired the shots because the people \nin the automobile were shouting at him and making threats against him. The \ndefendant asserts that he believed that the people in the automobile intended to \nrun down the calesa. The defendant also asserts that the occupants of the \nautomobile threw stones at the calesa, one of which struck him in the back of \nthe head.<\/p>\n<p><br\/>Eleventh. When the calesa occupied by the defendant and his two \ncompanions arrived in the city of Manila, at the corner of Calles Solis and Juan \nLuna, the defendant called to a Filipino policeman, by the name of Pablo Reyes, \nand asked him to take the number of the automobile that was following behind. At \nthat point the defendant got out of the calesa and was talking to the policeman \nReyes, when the automobile came up. When the automobile arrived at the point \nwhere the defendant was standing, Williams got out of the automobile and entered \ninto a conversation with the defendant, resulting in a quarrel and threats one \nagainst another. During the quarrel Williams, as he says, believing that the \ndefendant made a move to pull from his pocket a revolver, struck him a blow in \nthe face and the defendant, as a result of said blow, fell to the ground. When \nthe defendant fell to the ground as a result of the blow, Williams took from him \nhis revolver and its holster, and took them to the police station and turned \nthem over to the desk sergeant.<\/p>\n<p><br\/>Twelfth. As was said above, the defendant claims that while he was riding \nin the calesa in front of the automobile, some one of the occupants of the \nautomobile threw a stone at him and wounded him in the back of the head. It is \nadmitted that the defendant on the night in question received a wound in the \nback of his head. We are of the opinion, i however, that the wound was caused at \nthe time he fell to the ground as a result of the blow inflicted by Williams. \n<\/p>\n<p>Thirteenth. There is a labored attempt on the part of the defense to show \nthat the occupants of the automobile were trouble makers and were attempting not \nonly to annoy but to do him harm; that the occupants of the automobile were the \naggressors; that they were attempting to pick a quarrel with the defendant. In \nour opinion that contention' is unsupported by the proof; at least, there seems \nto be but little ground upon which such a charge can be based. <\/p>\n<p>Fourteenth. The defendant admits that he fired the four shots and that one of \nthem entered the arm of Leon Hernandez. He denies, however, that the shots were \nfired with the intention of doing any one harm. The defendant himself \ntestified:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I fired one shot. The two lights were shining in my face; I could see \nnothing but the lights. I just had to guess what I was shooting at. At that time \nthey were close by me\u2014a distance not very far\u2014and they were still shouting, some \nin Spanish and some in English. I could not understand all they said because I \ndon't understand Spanish very well. I waited possibly a minute and a half to \ngive them an opportunity to stop, and as they did not but kept on coming, I \nfired again. After the third shot I waited probably thirty seconds, and then \nthey slowed up. The first two shots I fired at the tires and the others I shot \nat the engine; I could guess where it was and I shot at it. I did not like to \nshoot into a load of men I had no quarrel with to hit 'em. When I fired at the \nmachine the horse was jumping\u2014scared. I fired between the lights for the engine \nafter I couldn't hit the tires.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Fifteenth. There is nothing in the record to justify the contention that the \noccupants of the automobile, and especially the injured person, Leon Hernandez, \nattempted in any way, by threats, intimidation, or otherwise, to cause the \ndefendant any bodily harm.<\/p>\n<p>Sixteenth. The record does not show very clearly the extent of the injury \nreceived by the said Leon Hernandez. The injury was received on the night of the \n5th of February., The record does not disclose on what day the trial was had. \nThe decision of the court was rendered on the 21st day of February. At the time \nof the trial Leon Hernandez testified that he was still unable to use his \narm.<\/p>\n<p>From an examination of the entire record, considering the admitted and \ndisputed facts, we have arrived at the conclusion that the defendant, at the \ntime of the shooting in question, did not intend to kill any of the occupants of \nthe automobile. That he fired at the automobile and in the direction of the \noccupants of the same is undisputed. That one of the bullets entered the arm of \nLeon Hernandez is not denied. We have held in numerous cases where the facts \nwere analogous to the facts in the present case, that when it appears that the \naccused discharged a firearm at another, but under circumstances which clearly \nindicated that an intent to kill was absent, his offense falls within the \nprovisions of article 408 of the Penal Code. (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Sabio, 2 Phil. \nRep., 485; U, S. <em>vs.<\/em> Pineda, 4 Phil. Rep., 223; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> \nAddison, 10 Phil. Rep., 230; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Kosel, 10<br\/>Phil. Rep., 409; U. \nS.<em>vs.<\/em> Samonte, 10 Phil. Rep., 643; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Marasigan, 11 \nPhil. Rep., 27.)<\/p>\n<p>In the foregoing decisions this court followed the interpretation given \narticle 408 by the supreme court of Spain. (3 Viada, 47; decisions of the \nsupreme court of Spain, February 12, 1872; March 7, 1872; February 26, 1874; \nDecember 19, 1882; January 30,1884.)<\/p>\n<p><br\/>The defendant was charged with the crime of frustrated homicide as \ndescribed in the complaint set out above. He was found guilty and sentenced to \nbe imprisoned for six years and a day for that crime. In our judgment the \nsentence of the lower court should be revoked and the defendant should be \nsentenced for the illegal discharge of a firearm, in accordance with the \nprovisions of article 408 of the Penal Code.<\/p>\n<p>It is, therefore, hereby ordered and decreed that the defendant be sentenced \nto be imprisoned for a period of two years eleven months and eleven days of \n<em>prision correccional,<\/em> and to pay the costs. So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> \nconcur.<\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" no=\"\" shade=\"\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<div align=\"center\"><br\/><br\/><strong>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING<br\/><br\/><\/strong>\n<p><\/p><\/div>\n<p><strong>MORELAND, J.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I doubt if the crime is properly qualified by the court in this case.<\/p>\n<p>In order to bring a case within article 408 of the Penal Code, which punishes \nthe discharge at another of a firearm \"if, the circumstances of the case are \nsuch that the act cannot be held to constitute a frustrated crime of parricide, \nmurder, or homicide, or an attempt to commit any one of these crimes, or any \nother crime for which a higher penalty is prescribed by any of the articles of \nthis code,\" it is necessary that it appear that the discharge of the firearm did \nnot result in an injury to the party against whom the attempt was made. If a \nserious injury is caused by the discharge, such as may be termed under the Penal \nCode<em> lesiones graves,<\/em> the person who fired the arm is guilty of two \ncrimes, namely, that defined by article 408 referred to and that of <em>lesiones \ngraves.<\/em> In such case he should be punished for the crime of <em>lesiones \ngraves<\/em> in its maximum degree in pursuance of article 89 of the Penal Code. \n(Supreme court of Spain, judgment of 13th of May, 1873; 3 Viada, 49.) If the \ndischarge resulted in injuries which may be termed under the Penal Code \n<em>lesiones menos graves,<\/em> the same rule applies. Two crimes have, in such \ncase, been committed, one, that defined in article 408, the other that of \n<em>lesiones menos graves<\/em>; and the accused must be sentenced for the \ngravest crime in its maximum degree. (U. S, <em>vs.<\/em> Marasigan, 11 Phil. \nRep., 27; decisions of supreme court of Spain of 12th of February, 1872, and \n26th of February, 1874; 3 Viada, 48.) <\/p>\n<p>In the case before us the court finds that the discharge of the firearm \n\"caused a serious injury.\" It appears from the record that the injury was caused \non the 5th day of February and that on the day of the trial, the 18th of \nFebruary, plaintiff's left arm, which was the member injured by the shot, was \nstill bandaged and he was unable to use it. Articles 416 and 418 define the \ncrimes of <em>lesiones graves<\/em> and <em>lesiones menos graves.<\/em> The \ninjury which causes <em>lesiones menos graves<\/em> is one which, not falling \nwithin articles 416 and 417, incapacitates the offended party for labor for \neight days or more or makes medical attendance necessary for the same period. It \nis very likely that, if the facts had been developed and the time required by \narticle 416 had been allowed to expire, the injury would have been found to be \nsufficient upon which to found the charge of <em>lesiones graves.<\/em> As the \nrecord stands, there is sufficient evidence to find that the injuries caused \nconstituted <em>lesiones menos graves.<\/em> That being so, the accused should \nhave been pronounced guilty of two crimes, namely, the discharge of a firearm as \ndefined in article 408 and the crime of <em>lesiones menos graves<\/em> as \ndefined by article 418 of the Penal Code, and he should have been punished in \nthe maximum degree of the gravest crime. This is the law as laid down by this \ncourt in United States <em>vs.<\/em> Marasigan (11 Phil. Rep., 27), where it was \nstated:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The discharge of a firearm by the accused against the injured party, \ninflicting on the latter <em>lesiones menos graves<\/em> about the head, \naccording to the criminal law produced two offenses, one being for discharging a \nfirearm against a given person, defined by article 408 of the Penal Code, and \nthe other, that of lesiones menos graves, penalized under article 418 of said \ncode, and as both offenses were the result of one sole criminal act, the \nadequate penalty, according to article 89 aforesaid, is that imposed by the law \nupon the more serious one, the same being applied in its maximum degree. No \nmitigating or aggravating circumstance is present in the commission of the crime \nherein, therefore the penalty should be imposed in the medium grade of the \nmaximum degree, and the penalty of three years and six months of <em>prision \ncorreccional<\/em> and accessories imposed on the accused, is in accordance with \nthe law.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the case before us the accused was found guilty simply of the crime of \ndischarging a firearm in violation of article 408, and although no aggravating \ncircumstance was proved and none was found by this court in its judgment of \nconviction, nevertheless, the accused is sentenced in the maximum degree of the \ncrime of which he is convicted. I agree to the penalty, but on grounds already \nstated.<\/p>\n<p>In order to avoid any misunderstanding relative to the rule in cases of \nattempted homicide, or murder, or parricide, I call attention to the fact that \nthe decision contains a statement that \"we have held in numerous cases where the \nfacts were analogous to the facts in the present case, that when it appears that \nthe accused discharged a firearm at another, but under circumstances which \nclearly indicated that an intent to kill was absent, his offense falls within \nthe provisions of article 408 of the Penal Code.\" While this is true,, of \ncourse, it does not, as I understand it, correctly express the rule laid down by \nthis court, which is that, where one person discharges a firearm at another, \n<em>and it does not clearly appear that he intended to kill,<\/em> he cannot be \nheld for frustrated or attempted murder or homicide but for some other crime. \nThe rule is correctly stated in United States vs. Sabio (2 Phil. Rep., 485), \nwhere the court says, at page 487:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In order to convict the defendant in this case of the crime of frustrated \nmurder, it was necessary to prove that the defendant with deliberate \npremeditation intended to kill Reyes.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We have never held, as might be inferred from the decision in this case, \nthat, to bring his acts within article 408, the accused must clearly show that \nthe intent to kill was absent The rule, as I have said, is quite the contrary. \nTo make the case one of attempted or frustrated homicide, murder, or parricide, \nthe Government must clearly show that the accused shot to kill. The burden of \nproving the intent is on the Government.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

The appeal is limited to parcels A and C, there being no question as to the location or identity of the same under the proofs offered by either party. The objection to the registration of these two par\u00adcels is based principally on the following notarial instrument:<br\/><blockquote>\"The undersigned scriptory creditors of the spouses Don Ramon Henson and Dona Matilde Magdangal, residents of the pueblo of Arayat, Province of Pampanga, have entered into the following agreement for effecting the transfer by sale and delivery of their property, as payment, on the grounds set forth.<br\/><br\/>\"1. Don Ceferino Revilla, in representation of the spouses Don Lino Cardenas Reyes and Dona Raymunda Soriano under power of attorney duly acknowledged, obligates him\u00adself to withdraw the complaint in the court of the Province of Pampanga which Don Manuel Murciano filed, raising the attachment levied on the hacienda belonging to those spouses, Don Ramon Henson and Dona Matilde Magdangal, situated in the barrio of Lacmit of the pueblo of Arayat, and leaving it free to the disposition of the undersigned.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The amount of seven thousand four hundred pesos, the subject matter of Don Manuel Murciano's complaint wherein Don Lino Cardenas Reyes was subrogated, shall fix the proportion in which he shall participate in both the expenses and the assets of said hacienda; likewise, Dona Joaquina Caldes shall participate in proportion to her two thousand and ninety-two pesos; Dona Concepcion Gruet de Atayde and Dona Cornelia Laochanco, in both expenses and assets, and these last two credits shall be liquidated on the current thirty-first of December; and all these credits shall be passed upon by the creditors themselves in order to determine the total liabilities, as the joint partnership capital.<br\/><br\/>\"3. After the expenses have been deducted, Messrs. Car\u00addenas and Caldes shall take from the net profits the pro\u00adportionate part corresponding to each, as set forth in the preceding clause, while the remainder shall be divided equally between the two creditors, Dona Concepcion Gruet de Atayde and Dona Cornelia Laochanco, without reference to the amounts of their credits.<br\/><br\/>\"4. These allotments of assets shall serve for extinguish\u00ading their respective credits, with the rate of interest made uniform at six per cent a year.<br\/><br\/>\"5. Care shall be taken by all the interested parties that the management be the most economical possible, with the maximum of production, and sale of the products of the hacienda at the best price.<br\/><br\/>\"6. Dona Joaquina Caldes also agrees to withdraw the complaint she has filed in the said court of Pampanga, raising the attachment levied in part on the products of said land, leaving them free to the disposition of the in\u00adterested parties themselves.<br\/><br\/>\"7. A book of minutes shall be kept for the decisions they may reach in regard to the administration and manage\u00adment of the hacienda, which book shall be in care of a person chosen by the creditors themselves; and they will submit, without appeal, to the decision of friendly arbitra\u00adtors, whenever they may disagree in a tie vote on subjects not expressly provided for in this agreement, each partner to have in the meeting only one vote, regardless of the amount of his credit; and all are obligated to perform what the majority decides.<br\/><br\/>\"8. With reference to his general credit of eight thousand and odd pesos, Mr. Cardenas agrees to collect the same after the undersigned shall have secured their respective credits.<br\/><br\/>\"9. As the first expense charged against the products of the hacienda, there shall be assigned to the spouses Henson and Magdangal a pension of thirty pesos a month from the first of January, 1889.<br\/><br\/>\"10.

On December 7, 1894, the former assigned her rights in the premises to the latter, who was the mother of the present petitioners.<br\/><br\/>The claim of ownership on the part of the petitioners to parcels A and C cannot be sustained. The document of December 7, 1888, copied above, constituted a novation of the preexisting claims of the creditors who affixed their names thereto, regardless of whether such claims were se\u00adcured by mortgage liens on the real property of the spouses, or were merely personal debts. It is self-evident from this document, that a contract of antichresis was created upon the property of the spouses; and that, as between the cred\u00aditors themselves, a partnership was formed, as is specific\u00adally stated in clause No. 2 thereof. The attempted sale of the property to two of these creditors shortly thereafter appears to have been made, on the part of the spouses, under a misunderstanding of its signification. It was made without the consent of the other parties to the original contract. The fact that at the time this contract of sale was entered in the property registry, the original contract did not appear therein, can make no difference under the facts of this case. The original contract was binding on the parties thereto and their privies, without registration.<br\/><br\/>Viewed in another light, the sale of January 12, 1889, was an attempt on the part of two of the partners to with\u00addraw from the partnership for their own personal profit before the termination of the partnership at the expense of the partnership, an act which was expressly prohibited by Law 12, Title 10, Fifth <i>Partida<\/i>, and is now so prohibited by article 1706 of the Civil Code. The notarial document of January 12, 1889, did not therefore convey the title to the land in dispute to the would be purchasers, and as the claim of ownership of the petitioners is necessarily based on that document, it results that the certificate of registra\u00adtion ought not to include those parcels.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Land Registration, in so far as it orders the entry of a decree of registration in favor of the petitioners of parcels A and C, is hereby reversed, and the petition as to those parcels is denied. Otherwise, the judgment is affirmed. Without costs in this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Carson<\/i> and <i>Araullo, JJ.<\/i>, concur.<br\/><i>Moreland, J.<\/i>, concurs in the result.<\/div>",

The witness further testified that without \nthe use of force, violence, or intimidation, Vicente Mallillin confessed that he \nhad helped the other defendants kill the carabao of Francisco Tumaliuan, and \nthat the pieces of horn found in Vicente's house exactly fitted the stubs of the \nhorns of the head found by Francisco.<\/p>\n<p>Eufrosina Mallillin and Aurea Balisi testified to having seen the two \nappellants in possession of carabao meat shortly after the time that Vicente \nMallillin confessed to have assisted them, the appellants, in killing the \noffended party's carabao.<br\/><br\/>Vicente Mallillin, who was charged in the same \ncomplaint but was later excluded on motion of the fiscal to be used as a witness \nfor the prosecution, testified that he and the two appellants killed the carabao \nof Francisco Tumaliuan on November 27, 1911; that Gervasio Gumarang arrived \nabout 9 o'clock at night of that day with the carabao which he said had been \ntaken from the offended party's barrio; that he, the witness, was invited to \nhelp kill it; that his house was about 60 yards distant from the house of \nGervasio; that he did not see the brand of the animal, but that he knew it was \nFrancisco's, as he was very familiar with it because the animal was for some \ntime very close to his house.<\/p>\n<p>The defense at first attempted to prove that a carabao of the appellants had \nrecently died and that they had used the meat. The intention evidently was to \nshow that the meat found on the fence, was that of the animal which died from \ndisease. This course was finally abandoned, as Gervasio Gumarang absolutely \ndenied that any meat was found in his possession. Vicente Mallillin, an \naccomplice, testified positively that the appellants stolie the carabao, and he \nwas fully corroborated in all essential details. The guilt of the appellants of \nhaving stolen and killed a carabao is therefore established beyond question of a \ndoubt.<\/p>\n<p>In support of their second assignment of error, appellants' counsel quote \nfrom section 8 of Act No. 1147, which pro vides that the certificate of \nownership therein provided for shall be <em>prima facie<\/em> evidence that the \nanimal is the property of the person therein named as owner.<br\/><br\/>Counsel also \nquote section 22 of the same Act, which provides: \"No transfer of large cattle \nshall be valid unless registered and a certificate of transfer secured as herein \nprovided.\"<\/p>\n<p>It is a well-settled principle of law that a material variance between the \nallegations and the proof as to the ownership of the stolen property in cases of \nlarceny is fatal to a conviction. (Underwood <em>vs.<\/em> State, 72 Ala., 220; \nKing <em>vs.<\/em> State, 44 Ind., 285; Jones<em> vs.<\/em> Com., 17 Gratt., Va., \n563; State <em>vs.<\/em> Wilson, 6 Ore., 428.) The legal title to the stolen \ncarabao in the case under consideration was not in Francisco Tumaliuan, but he, \nFrancisco, was in the lawful possession of the animal. He held the carabao by \nright of his contract of purchase.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Fowler<em> vs.<\/em> State (100 Ala., 96) Thomas J. Fowler was \nconvicted of the theft of an ox alleged to belong to Charles L. Phillips, The \nevidence tended, to prove that Phillips had purchased the ox from Malone &amp; \nCollins. On cross-examination Phillips was asked, \"if it was not the \nunderstanding at the time he got the ox from Malone &amp; Collins that he should \nkeep the oxen until fall, and that if he was able to pay for them he was to take \nthem; otherwise, he was to pay rent on them to Malone &amp; Collins.\" To this \nquestion the witness answered in the affirmative. He was then asked \"if he had \never paid Malone &amp; Collins for the oxen, or offered to pay them for the \nsame.\" The State objected to this question, the court sustained the objection, \nand the defendant duly excepted.<\/p>\n<p>In deciding the case on appeal the supreme court of Alabama said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It was immaterial whether Phillips had paid, or offered to pay, Malone &amp; \nCollins for the oxen or not. If he was in possession of them, at the time of the \nalleged larceny, either as a conditional purchaser or a bailee, the ownership \nwas properly laid in him.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The subject of the allegation and proof of ownership in cases of larceny is \ndiscussed in 25 Cyc, and on page 91 thereof is the following comment: \"Any legal \ninterest in the goods, although less than the absolute title, will support an \nallegation of ownership. But there must be an actual legal interest, not a mere \nclaim or expectation of interest. Thus a seller who has delivered the goods \ncannot be described as owner merely because negotiations are pending between him \nand the buyer for canceling the sale. So claiming ownership and attempting \nwithout success to do acts of ownership is not enough to justify a description \nas owner. The ostensible ownership is, however, enough to justify the \ndescription. So far as the thief is concerned, he cannot question the title of \nthe apparent owner.\"<\/p>\n<p>On pages 89 and 90 in Cyc, vol. 25, under the heading, \"Who should be laid as \nowner,\" we find the following: \"The actual condition of the legal title is \nimmaterial to the thief; so far as he is concerned, one may be taken as the \nowner who was in peaceable possession of it, and whose possession was unlawfully \ndisturbed by the taking. The possessor of the goods from whom the thief took \nthem may therefore properly be described as owner in the indictment. The \npossession must be actual; right of possession alone will not suffice. Nor a \ngeneral direction and control, not amounting to a legal possession. The goods \nneed not be in the actual manual possession of the person described as owner at \nthe moment of taking; it is enough that he was legally the possessor. Upon this \nprinciple the property of goods stolen may be laid in a bailee from whom they \nwere taken, as for instance in a common carrier, an innkeeper, a pledgee, a \nreceiver, a hirer or borrower, a <em>cestui que trust,<\/em> one in possession \nunder a contract for purchase, a washer woman who has the goods to wash, or a \ncoachmaker who has a coach to repair, or a lienor, a manufacturer who is \nperforming work on the materials of another, a cashier of a bank, or a constable \nwho has attached or taken the goods in execution.\"<\/p>\n<p>Although the actual legal title to the stolen carabao may not have been in \nFrancisco Tumaliuan, he was the peaceable possessor of the animal by reason of \nhaving purchased the same from Florencio Fulgan, By reason of this purchase, \naccompanied with the actual possession, Tumaliuan had a real or legal interest \nin the animal. The actual condition of the legal title was immaterial in so far \nas the appellants are concerned. They took the animal from the actual possession \nof Tumaliuan, the apparent owner. They cannot now be heard to say that Tumaliuan \nwas not the owner.<\/p>\n<p>The penalty imposed by the trial court is not the penalty provided by law for \nthe offense committed. The carabao stolen was valued at P220; hence, according \nto arts. 518 and 520 of the Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 2030, the proper \npenalty to be imposed upon the appellants is the penalty next higher in degree \nthan <em>arresto mayor<\/em> in its medium degree to <em>presidio \ncorressional<\/em> in its minimum degree, which is <em>presidio correctional<\/em> \nin its medium degree to <em>presidio mayor<\/em> in the minimum degree. There \nbeing present no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, the medium degree of \nthe proper penalty must be imposed. The judgment appealed from is therefore \nmodified by substituting four years two months and one day, <em>presidio \ncorrectional<\/em>, in lieu of the two years eleven months and eleven days \nimposed by the trial court. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed, with \ncosts against the appellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The complaint alleges, in substance, that \nplaintiff purchased certain real-estate at an execution sale, paying therefor \nthe sum of P2,170 to the defendant sheriff, who turned over the purchase price \nto the defendant company, the execution creditor, at whose instance the sale was \nhad that there-after, plaintiff having gone into possession of the land was \nevicted therefrom in judicial proceedings, wherein the court found that the land \nin question was the property of certain third parties, and that neither the \njudgment debtor nor the purchaser at the execution sale had any title thereto. \nThe prayer of the complaint is for judgment against the judgment creditor and \nthe sheriff for the amount of the purchase price paid at the execution sale.\n<p>The principal contention of counsel for appellee is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The only question presented by plaintiff is the interpretation to be placed \nupon section 470 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Unless this section gives him \nthe remedy for which he contends, he has stated no cause of action, because the \nonly other theory upon which he could possibly require a reimbursement of the \nprice paid by him at the sheriff's sale is that of an implied warranty by the \njudgment creditor and the sheriff. The complaint shows no compliance, as to the \nStandard Oil Company, with article 1481 of the Civil Code.<\/p>\n<p>\"We must admit that section 470 of the Code of Civil Procedure leaves \nsomething to be desired in the way of clearness. Its English text, which of \ncourse must govern in case of any discrepancy between the English and the \nSpanish versions, is as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\"'SEC 470. If the purchaser of real property sold on execution, or his \nsuccessor in interest, be evicted therefrom in consequence of irregularities in \nthe proceedings concerning the sale, or of the reversal or discharge of the \njudgment, he may recover the price paid, with interest, from the judgment \ncreditor. If the purchaser of property at such official sale, or his successor \nin interest, fail to recover possession in consequence of irregularity in the \nproceedings concerning the sale, or because the property sold was not subject to \nexecution and sale, the court having jurisdiction thereof shall, after notice \nand on motion of such party in interest, or his attorney, revive the original \njudgment in the name of the petitioner, for the amount paid by such purchaser at \nthe sale, with iriterest thereon from the time of payment at the same rate that \nthe original judgment bore; and the judgment so revived shall have the same \nforce and effect as would an original judgment of the date of the revival and no \nmore.'<\/p>\n<p>\"It appears, as appellant says, that this section divides naturally into two \nparts: (1) Authorizing the recovery of the purchase price under certain \nconditions, and (2) authorizing the revival of the judgment in behalf of the \npurchaser in other circumstances. Plaintiff claims to be entitled to the remedy \nset out in the first part of the section. It is apparent, however, that \nplaintiff's eviction, as set up in his complaint, is not due to any of the \ncauses shown in this first part of section 470. So far as appears, 'the \nproceedings concerning the sale' were perfectly regular, and the complaint \ndiscloses no 'reversal or discharge of the judgment' upon whose execution \nplaintiff became a purchaser.<\/p>\n<p>\"The second part of section 470, applied by the judge of the trial court, \nseems, at first glance, not exactly applicable, because it provides for the case \nwhere the purchaser may 'fail to recover possession,' while in the present case \nthe purchaser entered into possession and was subsequently dispossessed by \nothers. We think, however, that the phrase 'fail to recover possession' was \nintended to meet such a case as this; otherwise section 470 would not meet a \ncase like the present, although it was obviously intended to.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We agree with counsel for the appellee that the section of the Code in \nquestion leaves something to be desired in the way of clearness; and it may be \nadmitted that it is only by a liberal construction of the language used in the \nstatute that the sale of property under execution in which the judgment debtor \nhas no title, can be held to be an \"irregularity in the proceedings concerning \nthe sale.\"<\/p>\n<p>But we are of opinion, that the section of the Code of Civil Procedure under \nconsideration, being remedial in its character, should be construed liberally so \nas to give a remedy as broad as that to be obtained by the corresponding suit in \nequity, which we think, would extend to a case where the sale of property under \nexecution is held to be void on the ground that the judgment debtor had no \ntitle.<\/p>\n<p>The supreme court of California, discussing the provisions of section 708 of \nthe California Code of Civil Procedure in the case of Merguire <em>vs.<\/em> \nO'Donnell (139 CaL, 6), held as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We think a sale made by a sheriff on an order of the court and a void \nexecution is 'irregular' in the extreme degree, and that a sale had on a void \nexecution is void for the reason of 'irregularity in the proceedings concerning \nthe sale.' Section 708 of the Code of Civil Procedure, being remedial in its \ncharacter, should be liberally construed. (Hitchcock <em>vs.<\/em> Caruthers, 100 \nCaL, 100; Cross <em>vs.<\/em> Zane, 47 CaL, 602.) The section under consideration \nwas intended to give a remedy by petition in the action which had culminated in \nthe judgment sought to be revived. There was arid is a remedy by an independent \nsuit in equity by which similar relief may be had as is given by the statute \n(Scherr <em>vs.<\/em> Himmelman, 53 Cal., 312); and this remedy as administered \nin equity extends to cases where the execution and sale under it are both held \nto be void (Smith <em>vs.<\/em> Reed, 62 Cal., 345); and, giving the section the \nliberal construction required, it is clear that the remedy intended to be given \nunder it is as broad as that to be obtained in the corresponding action in \nequity. It is certainly necessary and consonant with the principles of equity \nthat a party should have relief in cases where the execution and sale are void, \nas well as in those cases where there is an irregularity of such a character as \nto render the sale merely voidable. Indeed, it would seem that the requirements \nof equity were the same in both the supposed cases, and there is no good reason \nfor applying the section to one of them and not to the other.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Upon like principles we think that where a sheriff, by virtue of the \nauthority conferred upon him by the issuance of an execution to sell the \nproperty of the judgment debtor, undertakes to sell and does sell property or an \ninterest in property to which the judgment debtor is in no wise entitled, there \nis certainly a grave irregularity in the procedure had under color of the \nauthority conferred by the execution, and it would Seem that in the absence of \nsome sufficient reason to the contrary, such an irregularity may fairly be Ijeld \nto be an \"irregularity in the proceedings concerning the sale.\"<\/p>\n<p>No sound reason suggests itself for restricting the meaning of the language \nof the statute so as to exclude there from cases such as that under \nconsideration. While the doctrine of <em>caveat emptor,<\/em> relied upon by \ncounsel for appellee, has its legitimate force and effect in precluding any idea \nof a warranty by plaintiff or defendant in execution or by the sheriff, it has \nno application in a case where a purchaser acquires <em>no title<\/em> to the \nproperty sold, as distinguished from a case wherein there is only a partial \nfailure of title; and it has been universally held that in case of failure of \ntitle a bona fide purchaser is entitled to recover the purchase price from the \nofficer, if the funds are still in his hands, or from the judgment debtor. True \nit is that in some jurisdictions in the United States purchasers at execution \nsales where the debtor had no title to the property sold have no cause of action \nagainst the judgment creditors, but in others, \"by judicial construction or \nexpress statutory enactment,\" a bona fide purchaser is given a cause of action \nagainst the execution creditors as well as the judgment debtor in case of \nfailure of title. See text and cases cited under heading \"Rights and remedies on \nfailure of title.\" (17 Cyc, 1319.) And we think that such was the intention of \nthe legislator in enacting the section under consideration.<br\/><br\/>In this \njurisdiction (even in the absence of the statute), under the general principle \nthat one person may not enrich himself at the expense of another, a judgment \ncreditor would not be permitted to retain the purchase price of land sold as the \nproperty of the judgment debtor after it has been made to appear that the \njudgment debtor had no title to the land and that the purchaser had failed to \nsecure title thereto, and we find no difficulty therefore in accepting a liberal \nconstruction of the statute which arrives at the same equitable result.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment in favor of the Standard Oil Company, and the execution issued \nthereon, gave to that company merely the right to have the property of the \njudgment debtor sold in satisfaction of the judgment. It did not and could not \ngive the company the right to have the judgment satisfied out of the property of \nany other person. By the tortious act of the sheriff, certain property was sold \nto which the judgment debtor had no title whatever; and the proceedings \nconcerning the sale having been found to be void and the purchaser having been \nevicted from the property, it is clear that the company had no right under its \njudgment to the proceeds of the sale, and that the sale having been held to have \nbeen void, the purchaser at the sale is equitably entitled to the return of the \npurchase price. This is precisely the result which we hold the remedial \nprovisions of the section under consideration were intended to secure, and it is \nthe result which naturally and properly follows from a liberal construction of \nits terms.<\/p>\n<p>We think that it will help to clear up the uncertainty as to the meaning of \nthe different provisions of the statute if it be kept in min3 that the remedy \nprovided in cases where \"the property sold was not subject to execution and \nsale\" was evidently intended to include cases wherein exempted property of the \njudgment debtor is sold under execution, and does not refer to cases wherein \nproperty of third persons is tortiously seized and sold, the case of Hitchcock \n<em>vs.<\/em> Caruthers (100 Cal., 100), cited in appellee's brief, to the \ncontrary notwithstanding. We think that the reasoning on which that decision \nshould have been based is that set forth in the later case of Merguire \n<em>vs.<\/em> O'Donnell, above cited.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff's right to recovery from the judgment creditor not being \npredicated on the theory of an express or implied warranty of title, defendant's \ncontentions based on the provisions of article 1481 of the code need not be \nconsidered at this time. If defendant was not given an opportunity to be heard \nin the.eviction proceedings, it would seem that he can avail himself in the \npending action of any defense which if set up in the former action would have \nrelieved him from liability to reimburse the purchaser.<\/p>\n<p>Let judgment be entered reversing the order of the court below sustaining the \ndemurrer to the complaint, and directing that the record be returned to the \ncourt below for further proceedings in accordance with law and the principles \nherein set forth.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

On February 28, \nthe court issued the following order:\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The above-named defendant having been sentenced, and his sureties having \nbeen notified to produce his body before the court, and having failed to do so \nafter due notice.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is <em>ordered,<\/em> That the defendant's bond be forfeited and execution \nissued against the principal and the sureties for the amount thereof, and that \nan alias warrant be issued for the arrest of the defendant.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Execution issued on March 5, property of the bondsmen was levied upon on \nMarch 13, and the sale was first advertised to take place on April 10, 1912. By \nvarious orders of the court, the sale was postponed from time to time, and \nfinally occurred on July 8, 1912, the Government being the purchaser. On July \n10,1912, the principal was arrested by the secret service corps. Under date of \nJuly 13, 1912, the court, on application of the sureties, set aside the order \nforfeiting the bond, and ordered the sheriff &amp; annul the sale of the \nproperty. It is these orders to which exceptions have been taken by the \nGovernment.<\/p>\n<p>The question which first arises is, Did the execution sale occur on the date \ndirected by the court? Section 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Unless otherwise specially provided, the time within which an act is \nrequired by law to be done shall be computed by excluding the first day and \nincluding the last; and if the last be a Sunday or a legal holiday, it shall be \nexcluded.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The last postponement of the sale dated from June 24, 1912. If the court \ndirected that the postponement be for two weeks, it is clear that the last day \nof the last extension of time was July 8, from 12 midnight to 12 midnight. (Art. \n7, Civil Code.) So that, in order to allow a full two weeks from June 24, the \nsale should not have occurred until some time during July 9, at the earliest. \nThe sale was postponed four times. The last two postponements were made by \nverbal orders of the court, the only evidence of the same in the record as to \ntheir import being the return of the sheriff. The return says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"On June 21, 1912, under a verbal order of the court, the sale announced was \nsuspended for another three days; wherefore, the sale was again announced for \nthe 24th of said month of June at the same hour.<\/p>\n<p>\"On June 24, 1912, and under another verbal order of the court, the said sale \nwas again suspended for some two weeks more, <em>transferring it to the 8th of \nJuly, 1912, at 9 o'clock sharp in the morning.\"<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It is not here stated that the court allowed the sureties two weeks more of \ngrace from June 24. Had it done so the sale, occurring as it did on July 8, \noccurred one day too soon. But it is distinctly said that the court appointed \nJuly 8 at 9 o'clock in the morning as the date of the sale. There is no question \nbut that the court could grant an extension of time to the sureties of thirteen \ndays or any other less period than two full weeks. We are of the opinion that \nthe court in this last order, as in its first <em>written<\/em> order of \npostponement of the sale, dated May 24, merely fixed the new date of the sale at \na future day, without attempting to compute the time thus allowed to the \nsureties; Section 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure is applicable where a given \nperiod of time must be added to a certain date in order to determine the date on \nwhich an act must be performed. But there is no necessity for such computation, \nand hence no room for the application of this section, when that date is fixed \nby name in the instrument directing the act to be performed. The court in the \ncase at bar postponed the sale which was to have occurred on June 24. At the \nsame time it directed that the sale <em>should take place<\/em> on a \n<em>named<\/em> future date. Section 4, has, therefore, no application to the \npresent case, and the sale took place at the time designated by the order of the \ncourt.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Upon a sale of real property, the purchaser shall be substituted to, and \nacquire all the right, interest, title, and claim of the judgment debtor \nthereto, subject to the right of redemption as hereinafter provided.\" (Section \n463, Code Civ. Proc.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In this jurisdiction no confirmation of an ordinary execution sale of a \njudgment debtor's property is required. Title vests in the purchaser when the \nsale is made, subject only to the right of redemption allowed under section 464. \nThereafter, if the debtor would secure the return of his property, he must \nredeem it.<\/p>\n<p>It is true that if there be some fatal defect in the proceedings the sale may \nbe set aside. But unless some such defect be alleged and proven, it must stand. \nA judgment debtor cannot come into court and request nor can the court order \nwithout some valid reason, that the sale be set aside. In the case at bar, the \ncourt undertook to set the sale aside presumably because the principal had been \narrested by the authorities on July 10, 1912. But his arrest on that date did \nnot satisfy the conditions of the bond. If we look to the equities of the case, \nit will be seen that the court had already dealt<br\/>most leniently with the \nsureties. Four times the court had postponed the execution sale. Whereas the \nbond allowed them thirty days after default to produce their principal, the \nsureties in this case were allowed more than four times that period. Clemency to \nthe sureties must end somewhere if a bail bond is not to lose altogether its \nsolemnity and become an object of derision. The arrest of the principal two days \nsubsequent to the sale was no reason for setting the sale aside.<\/p>\n<p>But it is said that the court had control over all of the proceedings in \nreference to the confiscation of the bond and the sale of the property, on July \n13, when the orders appealed from were entered. The following paragraph in the \norder of August 19, denying the fiscal's motion for a rehearing, is cited in \nsupport of this contention: Painaga \"was eventually discovered in Manila and \narrested for another offense. In the meantime the sale of property levied upon \nunder execution had been made to the Government as a purchaser, and the \nsuspension of the confiscation of the bond still existed, and the sureties asked \nthat the sale be set aside as well as the confiscation of the bond.\"<\/p>\n<p>When the principal was arrested the property had been sold and the execution \nsatisfied. Everything had then terminated except the right of the sureties to \nredeem the property within one year, if they desired to do so. The court seems \nto intimate in the above paragraph that the \"suspension of the confiscation of \nthe bond still existed\" at the time the property was sold on July 8. But we find \nnothing in the record to support this theory. The order of confiscation was \nentered, as we have said, on February 28, after due notice to the sureties, and \nthe sureties at no time asked that this order or judgment be disturbed. They \nonly asked from time to time that the sale of the property be postponed, so \nthere was no order in force on July 8 suspending either the sale or the \nenforcement of the judgment of February 28. Under these facts and circumstances, \nhad the court lost control over its judgment of February 28, when it issued the \norders appealed from on July 13? We think this question must be answered in the \naffirmative.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of the United States <em>vs.<\/em> Bonoan (22 Phil. Rep., 1), it \nwas held: \"Under the provisions of section 76 of General Orders, No. 58, the \nfollowing procedure in the forfeiture of bail bonds must be followed: (1) If the \ndefendant fails or neglects to appear on any occasion when his presence is \nrequired by the court, or fails to surrender himself in execution of the \njudgment, an order forfeiting the bond or the deposit must be entered; (2) the \ncourt shall then notify the bondsmen and give them thirty days within which to \npresent the body of their principal; (3) if the bondsmen do not present the \ndefendant within the said thirty days and do not satisfactorily explain the \nreasons therefor, the court must then render judgment against the bondsmen for \nthe amount represented in the bond.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the case at bar the procedure outlined in the above quotation was not \nstrictly followed. The court in effect forfeited the bond and rendered judgment \nagainst the sureties at the same time, but this was not done until the lapse of \ntwenty days after the sureties had been notified to present the body of their \nprincipal. The fact that the order of confiscation and judgment against the \ncreditors were entered at the same time, and only twenty days after the sureties \nhad been notified to present the body of their principal, did not deprive the \ncourt of jurisdiction of either the persons or the subject matter of the action. \nThe sureties, at no time questioned the validity of the judgment or the \nprocedure adopted. Neither did they note an exception or take any steps looking \ntoward an appeal. In their motion asking the court to set aside the judgment and \nthe sale of the property the sureties neither alleged fraud nor any irregularity \nor any matter which could \/affect the validity of the proceedings. The only \nreason they gave was the fact that their principal had been arrested and was \nthen in confinement serving the sentence, but his arrest did not take place \nuntil after the judgment had been satisfied by the sale of the property.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons the orders appealed from are reversed. The \nconfiscation of the bond and the sale of the property must stand. No costs will \nbe allowed in this instance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" no=\"\" shade=\"\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<p><\/p>\n<div align=\"center\"><strong>DISSENTING <\/strong><\/div>\n<p><strong>MORELAND, J<\/strong>. <\/p>\n<p>I am compelled to dissent in this case.<\/p>\n<p>The reason why I dissent is that the court holds that the issuance of an \nexecution, and the seizure and sale thereunder of the property of a surety on a \nbail bond, are legal and valid acts and the execution a valid process, although \nthe surety had no trial or hearing, although no notice of any kind or character \nwas given him, and although <em>no judgment was ever found, dictated or entered \nagainst him or any other person.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The appeal is from an order of the Court of First Instance of Manila setting \naside the forfeiture of a bail bond and the sale of certain property belonging \nto the surety under an execution issued upon such forfeiture.<\/p>\n<p>The undertaking which is the subject matter of this proceeding was given by \nEvaristo Painaga and Emeterio Su\u00f1ga in a criminal action to secure the liberty \npending trial of the said Evaristo Painaga, who was charged with a violation of \nthe Opium Law in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila.<\/p>\n<p>The accused was found guilty in a judgment of the court filed on the 1st day \nof February, 1912. On the 7.th day of the same month the court issued the \nfollowing notice to the surety, Emeterio Su\u00f1ga, which was duly served upon him \non the same day, to wit:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"You are hereby directed to produce the body of Evaristo Painaga at the Court \nof First Instance, city of Manila, Part I, on the 8th day of February, 1912, 8 \na. m.<\/p>\n<p>\"The sureties are hereby notified that if without sufficient cause the \ndefendant above mentioned neglects to appear before the court on the date and \nhour specified above, the bail or bond, as the case may be, will be declared \nforfeited.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On the 28th day of the same month the court issued the following order:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The above-named defendant having been sentenced, and his sureties having \nbeen notified to produce his body before the court, and having failed to do so \nafter due notice,<\/p>\n<p><em>\"It is ordered<\/em>. That the defendant's bond be forfeited and <em>that \nexecution issue against the principal and the sureties for the amount \nthereof,<\/em> and that a bench warrant be issued for the arrest of the \ndefendant\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On the 5th day of March execution was issued against the property of Sunga, \nthe surety, and. a levy made upon his house and lot, which constituted all of \nhis possessions. The sale was postponed from time to time until the 8th day of \nJuly, when it took place, the property levied upon being sold to the Insular \nGovernment. Shortly after the sale the fugitive was apprehended and produced in \ncourt, whereupon, upon application, the court discharged the forfeiture and set \naside the sale in the following order, to wit:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The sureties having prayed that the order confiscating the bond in this case \nbe vacated and the sale of the property under an execution issued by virtue \nthereof be set aside, and it appearing that said sureties have made diligent \nefforts to fulfill the conditions of the bond and that the accused has appeared \nbefore the court to fulfill the sentence pro nounced upon him.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is hereby ordered that the order confiscating the undertaking given by \nthe accused and his sureties be and is hereby vacated and set aside, and it is \nalso ordered that the sheriff vacate and annul the sale of the property of said \nsureties upon payment of all the costs of the proceedings.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Thereupon a motion was made by the prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila \nto vacate said order upon the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to make \nit. After due hearing the court denied the motion in an opinion, part of which \nis as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In this case the bond was forfeited for failure on the part of the sureties \nto produce the defendant in court when called for by the court, and execution \nwas issued upon the forfeiture against the sureties upon the bond.<\/p>\n<p>\"The sureties appeared within a short time after forfeiture and asked for a \n<em>suspension of the forfeiture<\/em> in order to give them an opportunity to \nproduce the defendant, he having been at liberty under bond after judgment \nentered in this court. <em>The suspension was granted<\/em> pending the effort of \nthe sureties to obtain the defendant and produce him in court, and sale of \nproperty levied upon under execution was suspended for the same reason.<\/p>\n<p>\"The sureties made special endeavor to find the defendant, following him over \nthe Island of Mindoro and the Batangas Peninsula. In the meantime an alias \nwarrant for his arrest was issued and was not served because the defendant could \nnot be found. He was eventually discovered in Manila and arrested for another \noffense.<\/p>\n<p>\"In the meantime the sale of property levied upon under execution had been \nmade to the Government as a purchaser, <em>and the suspension of the \nconfiscation of the bond still existed,<\/em> and the sureties asked that the \nsale be set aside as well as the confiscation of the bond.<\/p>\n<p>\"Believing that the sureties had honestly and in good faith attempted to \ncomply with their obligation to deliver the defendant to the court, an order was \nmade setting aside the confiscation and the sale made of the property levied \nupon under execution to take effect upon the payment by the sureties of all the \ncosts incurred in relation to the confiscation and sale under \nexecution.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This appeal is from the order of denial.<\/p>\n<p>This court has reversed the order of the court below, holding that it had no \njurisdiction to discharge the forfeiture and set aside the sale.<\/p>\n<p>The decision lays down what I regard as the remarkable doctrine to which I \nhave referred already. May the property of an individual be forcibly seized \nunder execution and sold, without a trial, without a hearing, without notice, \nand <em>without even a judgment against him or any other person?<\/em> The court \nby this decision holds that it may and that a sale under a seizure made under \nsuch circumstances is so jealously guarded by the law that it may not thereafter \nbe set aside.<\/p>\n<p>It is undisputed in this case that the surety on the bond, which is the \nsubject matter of this action, was never given a hearing, had no \n<em>opportunity<\/em> to be heard, was not even given notice of a hearing, and \nthat no <em>judgment has ever been found, declared, or entered against him, or \nhis principal, or any other person.<\/em> The surety never dreamed that there was \nany proceeding whatever begun or pending against him until the sheriff seized \nhis property under execution', and the fact was that there <em>was<\/em> \nnone.<\/p>\n<p>As has already been noted, on February 7 the trial court issued a notice to \nthe surety, hereinabove set forth, which simply advised him that if he did not \nproduce the body of the convict on or before the 8th day of February, the bond \nwould be declared forfeited. No notice was given of any intended hearing or \ntrial or that judgment would be taken against him or execution issued against \nhis property. On the 28th of February, and without further notice, the court \nentered the order of the 28th of February, hereinabove set forth, in which he \ndeclared the bond forfeited and ordered the issuance of an execution against the \nsurety's property. The execution was issued, not on a judgment, because there \nwas none, but simply and solely on the <em>declaration of forfeiture.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Under the law of the Philippine Islands no execution can be lawfully issued \nunless there is first a judgment upon which it may be based. There must be found \na specific amount due from one person or entity to another which must be \ndeclared in a judgment. The Code of Civil Procedure provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"SEC. 443, <em>When execution may issue.<\/em>\u2014The party in whose favor \njudgment is given, may, at any time within five years after the entry thereof, \nhave a writ of execution issued for its enforcement, as hereinafter \nprovided.<\/p>\n<p>\"SEC. 444. <em>Issuance, form, and requisites of execution.<\/em>\u2014 The \nexecution must be issued in the name of the United States of America, Philippine \nIslands, sealed with the seal of the court, and subscribed by the judge, or \nclerk thereof, and be directed to the governor of the province, or any of his \ndeputies, and <em>must intelligibly refer to the judgment,<\/em> stating the \ncourt, and the province where the record of the <em>judgment<\/em> is, and if it \nbe for money, the amount thereof, and the <em>amount actually due thereon;<\/em> \nand if made payable in a specified kind of money or currency the execution must \nalso state the kind of money or currency in which the <em>judgment<\/em> is \npayable, and must direct the governor or his deputy, substantially as \nfollows:<\/p>\n<p>\"1. If the execution be against the property of the <em>judgment<\/em> debtor, \nit must require the governor, or his deputy, to satisfy the judgment with \ninterest, out of the personal property of such debtor, and if sufficient \npersonal property cannot be found, then out of his real property; * * \n*\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Every section of the Code shows the absolute necessity of a judgment before \nan execution can issue. A judgment, of course, presupposes a trial or some kind \nof a hearing, with the necessary formalities which accompany it. In the case \nbefore us it is undisputed, indeed appears affirmatively of record, that there \nwas no judgment whatever rendered against the surety, there having been no trial \nor hearing, no pleadings, no issues, no evidence, no findings of fact or \nconclusions of law, no declaration of liability, no determination of the amount. \nThe bond was declared forfeited and execution issued instantly. The word \n\"execution\" is built upon the same root as \"execute,\" which is transitive. As \nused in the law it refers to the judgment upon which it is based and which it is \nto \"execute.\" The execution issued in .this case had no relation to any act of \nthe court, the surety, or the principal. It was a blue-sky execution. As such it \nwas absolutely void and could have no force or effect. The sale thereunder was, \nin consequence, void. In reality there existed no necessity for setting it \naside. The surety could have replevined the property precisely the same as if it \nhad been taken by a stranger who seized it without even a pretense of right. The \ncourt acted properly and legally in setting the whole proceeding aside.<\/p>\n<p>It should be noted also that the court below, in its two last orders, states \nspecifically that the forfeiture <em>was suspended soon after it was declared \nand long before the sale;<\/em> and that the <em>suspension was in full vigor at \nthe very time the sale took place.<\/em> If this is so, then there was an \nadditional ground why the sale should have been set aside; for a sale which \ndepends for its validity wholly upon a forfeiture can have no abiding virtue if \nmade while the forfeiture is suspended, especially where, as in this case, it \nwas vacated and set wholly aside before that suspension ceased.<\/p>\n<p>But the execution and the sale were at least voidable for other reasons. \nUnder the Philippine Bill no person can be deprived of his property against his \nwill without due process of law. He is entitled to be notified and to be heard \nbefore his property shall be seized. Here not only did the surety have no \nhearing whatever but he received no notice of any intention to hold him \nresponsible for anything. He not only had no hearing but he was given no \nopportunity to be heard. Indeed, instead of being notified to appear and defend \nhimself, the notice that he received was to an effect altogether different. It \nsimply informed him that the bond would be forfeited if he did not produce the \nconvict in court on or before a day named. This was a clear intimation that the \nforfeiture of the bond would be the only thing done in case of failure to \nproduce.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, section 76 of the Code of Criminal Procedure lays down the \nprocedure which must be followed when a bond given in a criminal case is \nforfeited. It provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If without sufficient cause the defendant neglects to appear for \narraignment, trial, or judgment, or neglects to appear on any other occasion \nwhen his presence may be required in court, or fails to surrender himself in \nexecution of the judgment, the court must direct the fact of his neglect or \nfailure to be entered in the record of the cause, and declare the undertaking or \ndeposit, as the case may be, to be forfeited. But if at any time within thirty \ndays there after the defendant or his counsel appears and satisfactorily \nexplains the neglect or failure, the court may direct the forfeiture to be \ndischarged upon such terms as it may consider just. If the forfeiture is not so \ndischarged, the promotor fiscal <em>shall<\/em> at once proceed by \n<em>action<\/em> against the bail upon their undertaking.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Under this section we notice, in the first place, that nothing can be done \nafter the declaration of forfeiture until thirty days have elapsed, because, \nduring that time, the defendant or his counsel may appear and explain the \nneglect or failure and the court may direct the forfeiture to be discharged. In \nspite of this the trial court declared the forfeiture twenty days after the \nfailure of the defendant to appear for sentence. In other words, the judgment of \nconviction was entered on the 1st day of February, the notice given to produce \nthe defendant on the 8th day of February, and the forfeiture declared on the \n28th of the same month. <\/p>\n<p>In the second place, it should be carefully noted that the section provides \nthat if the forfeiture is not discharged the prosecuting attorney <em>shall<\/em> \nproceed <em>by action<\/em>. This means, of course, that the surety must be duly \nnotified and be given an opportunity to be heard in his own defense. (U. S. \n<em>vs.<\/em> Carmen, 13 Phil. Rep., 455.) This means, equally of course, that \nthere must be pleadings, issues, that a trial must be had, findings made and \njudgment entered. Not one of these requirements was met in this case. The surety \nwas deprived of his property absolutely without ceremony.<\/p>\n<p>So far as I can discern, the decision of the court gives no consideration to \nthese fundamental questions. It discusses at length the number of times the sale \nwas postponed, the law applicable to the counting of the days for which it was \npostponed, when the title passes under an execution sale and what is the nature \nof that title, whether the court has control over proceedings in cases of \nconfiscation, and terminates with the suggestion that \"the sureties at no time \nquestioned the validity of the judgment or the procedure adopted.\" The \ndifficulty with this suggestion is that it assumes that a judgment existed, \nwhile the fact is the exact contrary. No judgment was ever dictated by the \ncourt, nor was one ever entered against the surety or anybody else. There was, \ntherefore, nothing to which the surety could except or which he could move to \nvacate or which he could ask to have amended or from which he could appeal. \nMoreover, the decision also assumes that there was a procedure adopted. The \nexact contrary is true. There was no procedure whatever. The surety was not \nproceeded against. There was no proceeding to which he could object unless it \nwas the bare issuance of the execution; and if there was nothing1 upon which the \nexecution could be issued, there was no. necessity for an objection to it. One \nis not obliged to object to a proceeding which does not exist, or to any part \nthereof, if a proceeding which does not exist has parts. The same foundationless \nassumption is again made by the court in its expression with respect to the \nreasons which the surety gave the trial court in the motion to set aside the \nsale.<\/p>\n<p>The court says: \"The only reason they gave was the fact that their principal \nhad been arrested and was then in confinement serving his sentence, but his \narrest did not take place until after the <em>judgment had been satisfied by the \nsale of the property.\" (Italics mine.)<br\/><\/em><br\/>No judgment was satisfied, \nbecause none existed. The assumption is erroneous. No judgment was dictated or \nentered against anybody. The execution was not based on a judgment, but was \nissued out of blue sky. <\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, there was no practical reason why the surety should object, as \nthe court had suspended the confiscation of the bond, had postponed the sale, \nand was giving him every opportunity to capture the fugitive. It was but natural \nthat the surety should prefer to produce the criminal if he could and thus save \nhimself the expense and trouble of litigation on the bond. All of the acts of \nthe court were favorable to him from this point of view and he let well enough \nalone. He knew that, if he produced the accused in court, that would be the end \nof all of his difficulties; whereas, if he had acted as the decision in this \ncase says he should have acted, he would have been compelled to begin \nproceedings to set aside acts of the court which at that very moment were being \nsuspended in his favor. Even if it be assumed that ordinarily the surety should \nhave objected to the proceedings, he was fully justified in not doing so under \nall the circumstances of this case.<\/p>\n<p>The order appealed from should be affirmed.<br\/><em>Order \nreversed.<\/em><br\/><\/p><\/div>",

I., \nin violation of the law.\"<\/p>\n<p>The facts disclosed by the evidence of record are fully set forth by the \nSolicitor-General in his brief on appeal as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The evidence adduced by the prosecution shows that on the evening of May 1, \n1913, some warehouses owned by Jacobo Selzer were destroyed by a fire and that \ntheir destruction entailed a loss estimated at P8,400; that the defendant was \nseen in the neighborhood during the afternoon of the day on which the fire \noccurred, and asked.a servant of Selzer if her masters were at home and was \ninformed that they were away; that after the fire started the defendant was seen \na short distance from the burning warehouses running away from them.<\/p>\n<p>\"There was no evidence introduced by the defense.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The decision of the trial judge is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In this case it has been proven that the accused, Amado Esmundo, a short \ntime before the fire in question, was seen near the buildings that were burned \nand was asking one of the servants of the house, Eugenia Arsega, if her master \nand mistress were at home on that occasion. He was told by her that they were \nnot. It is further shown by the witness Andres Villamayor that when he started \nfor the fire at its inception he met the accused running away from the fire. It \nis shown by the witness Sabas Villamayor that on the night when the warehouses \nwere burned the accused was seen in the neighborhood of said warehouses going in \nthe direction of the warehouses. It is objected that the testimony of Sergeant \nCarreon of the Constabulary is not sufficient because it has not been shown that \nthese declarations of the accused were given spontaneously, freely and \nwillingly. The court is of the opinion that the evidence is sufficient even if \nwe exclude the testimony of said Sergeant Carreon.<\/p>\n<p>\"The court, therefore, finds the accused Amado Esmundo guilty as charged in \nthe complaint and sentences him to eight years and one day-in Bilibid, to \nindemnify the injured party, Jacobo Selzer, in the sum of eight thousand three \nand twenty pesos (P8,320) and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary \nimprisonment as prescribed by law, and to pay the costs of this proceeding. It \nis so ordered. <\/p>\n<p>\"Done in open special court at Cabanatuan, Province of Nueva Ecija, Fourth \nJudicial District, on this the 24th day of September, 1913.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p align=\"right\"><strong>\"W. E. McMAHON,<\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"right\"><em>\"Judge of the Mountain Judicial District,<\/em><\/p>\n<p align=\"right\"><em>\"Acting in the Fourth Judicial District.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Counsel for appellant, appointed de officio by this court, concludes his \nbrief with the following observation:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We submit that it is useless to write a brief on this case.<br\/>The \nprosecution has no case at all.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We are strongly inclined to agree with counsel. In the absence of any \nevidence as to motive, there is nothing in the record which would sustain a \nfinding that the origin of the fire was malicious and not accidental, or that \nthis accused was guilty of the crime of arson with which he was charged.<\/p>\n<p>The accused introduced no evidence in his own defense, but in doing so he was \nclearly within his rights, and the prosecution having failed utterly to make out \na case, there was no necessity for his doing so. Certainly no inference of guilt \ncan be drawn from his silence, though we are at a loss to account for the \nconviction in the court below unless the trial judge overlooked the presumption \nof innocence in favor of the accused and his right to decline to testify at the \ntrial without having any inference of guilt drawn from his failure to go on the \nwitness stand.<\/p>\n<p>As appears from the information, the fiscal before going to trial was well \naware that he had no evidence as to a motive which might have induced the \naccused to commit the crime of arson, and with no evidence which even tended to \ndisclose that the buildings had been set on fire maliciously, it would seem that \nhe should either have asked for a dismissal, or for a continuance until he could \nfind some evidence tending directly to establish the commission by the accused \nof the oifense with which he was charged. For the benefit of the various \nofficers engaged in the prosecution of criminal offenses, we cite from a former \ndecision as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The records of criminal cases submitted to this court so frequently disclose \na lack of all effort to develop the motive for the commission of the crime \ncharged, that we take advantage of this opportunity to direct the attention of \nall prosecuting officers, and especially of provincial fiscals, to the \nimportance of definitely ascertaining and proving when possible the motives \nwhich actuated the commission of a crime under judicial investigation. It is \ntrue that it is not indispensable to conviction for murder that the particular \nmotive for taking the life of a human being shall be established at the trial, \nand that in general when the commission of a crime is clearly proven conviction \nmay and should follow even where the reason for its commission is unknown (151 \nU. S., 396); but in many criminal cases one of the most important aids in \ncompleting the proof of the commission of the crime by the accused is the \nintroduction of evidence disclosing the motive which tempted the mind to indulge \nthe criminal act; and in nearly every case wherein the' law places the penalty \nto be imposed in the discretion of the courts within certain limits, it will be \nfound that a knowledge of the motive which actuated the guilty person is of the \ngreatest service in the exercise of this discretion.\" (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> \nCarlos, 15 Phil. Rep., 47.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The judgment of conviction entered in the court below should be reversed, and \nthe accused acquitted of the offense with which he is charged in the \ninformation, with costs in both instances de officio. If in detention he will be \nset at liberty forthwith, and if at large under bail, his bond should be \nexonerated. So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

I., on June 4, 1912.\n<p>The evidence of record conclusively establishes the guilt of the appellants \nof the offense with which they are charged and of which they were convicted, and \nwe find no error in the proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the \naccused.<\/p>\n<p>So far as can be gathered from the record, the accused were not represented \nby counsel at the trial of the case in the court below, and it does not \naffirmatively appear from the record whether the trial judge did or did not \ncomply with the provisions of section 17 of General Orders No. 58 as amended by \nsection 1 of Act No. 440, which are as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If the defendant appears without counsel, he must be informed by the court \nthat it is his right to have counsel before being arraigned, and must be asked \nif he desires the aid of counsel. If he desires and is unable to employ counsel, \nthe court must assign counsel to defend him. A reasonable time must be allowed \nfor procuring counsel. Section 1 of Act No. 440 provides:<\/p>\n<p>\"Section seventeen of General Order Number Fifty-eight, issued from the \noffice of the United States Military Governor in the Philippine Islands on the \ntwenty-third day of April, nineteen hundred, relating to criminal procedure, is \nhereby amended by adding at the end thereof the following words:<\/p>\n<p>\"The counsel so employed or assigned must be a duly authorized member of the \nbar: <em>Provided, nevertheless,<\/em> That in provinces where duly authorized \nmembers of the bar are not available, the court may, in its discretion, admit or \nassign some person, resident in the province and of good repute for probity and \nability, to act as counsel for the defendant, although the person so admitted or \nassigned be not a duly authorized member of the bar.' \"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Counsel for appellants insists that the judgment of the lower court should be \nreversed and the appellants acquitted because of the failure of the record to \nshow that the trial judge complied with these provisions of law; and the \nAttorney-General in a motion dated October 20, 1913, appears to be in accord \nwith counsel for the appellants as to the reversal of the judgment of \nconviction, but prays that the case be remanded to the court below for a new \ntrial.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of the United States <em>vs.<\/em> Santos (4 Phil. Rep., 419), \nthis court said: \"If on answering the complaint he (the defendant) did so \nwithout the assistance of a lawyer, this would not be ground for alleging a \ndefect in the procedure. To be able to urge this, it should first appear that \nthe defendant had asked for the assistance of a lawyer to answer the complaint \nand that the trial had proceeded without any attention being paid to his \nrequest.\"<\/p>\n<p>Adhering to the doctrine laid down in that case, the only question to be \ndetermined in this case is whether the failure of the record to disclose \naffirmatively that the trial judge advised the accused of their right to have \ncounsel is sufficient ground to reverse the judgment of conviction and to send \nthe case back for a new trial. Upon this point we are all agreed that in the \nabsence of an affirmative showing that the court below did in fact fail to \nadvise the accused of their rights under the provisions of section 17 of General \nOrders No. 58, as amended by section 1 of Act No. 440, the mere omission from \nthe record brought here upon appeal of an entry affirmatively disclosing that he \ndid so, is not reversible error.<\/p>\n<p>In the absence of an affirmative showing to the contrary, the court below \nmust be presumed in matters, of this kind to have complied with the provisions \nof law prescribing the procedure to be followed in the trial had before him.<\/p>\n<p>In Elliott's Appellate Procedure, section 291, the rule as to presumptions in \nfavor of the legality and regularity of the proceedings in trial courts, is \nstated as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is an established rule in criminal cases, as well as in civil cases, that \nthe appellate tribunal will indulge all reasonable presumptions in favor of the \nlegality and regularity of the proceedings of the trial court. Where all the \ninstructions are not in the record those asked by the defendant will be presumed \nto have been properly refused because included in the instructions given. Where \nthe evidence is not in the record it will be presumed that the instructions were \nbased upon it, and that there was no error, but if the instructions can not be \ncorrect upon any supposable state of the evidence this presumption will not \nprevail. It is held that where the record shows the presence of the accused at \nthe beginning of the trial it will be presumed that he continued in court; this \npresumption would certainly prevail where it appeared that the accused had an \nopportunity to make, and did make, all of the motions that could be of service \nto him. It will be found, on investigation, that the rule that the trial court \nis presumed to have done its duty and conducted the proceedings legally and \nregularly is substantially the same in criminal cases as it is in civil cases. \nThere is no valid reason why the rule should be different, nor do the decided \ncases warrant the conclusion that it is different; on the contrary, the \ndecisions very generally refer to civil cases in support of the conclusions \nasserted. The doctrine deducible from the decided cases is, it may be said in a \ngeneral way, that the presumption is, that there was no prejudicial error, and \nthat error must be shown affirmatively by the record, or the presumption will \nprevail.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The doctrine is further expanded in section 710 of the same author, as \nfollows: \"The rule that all reasonable presumptions and intendments will be made \nin favor of the rulings of the trial court is one of the best settled and most \nfrequently applied rules in appellate procedure. The rule rests on a firm \nfoundation. It is supported by the elementary principle that official acts are \npresumed to be rightfully performed. But when it is brought to mind that a court \nacts impartially, upon full information and with calm deliberation, the \nfoundation of the rule stated will at once be perceived to be broader and \nstronger than that which underlies the rule supporting the acts of ministerial \nor executive officers.\"<br\/><br\/>The doctrine, supported by many citations of \nauthority, is thus stated in the Encyclopedia of Pleading and Practice, volume \n2, page 420: \"The general assumption obtains in all legal proceedings that \njudicial tribunals and officials act according to law. On appeal accordingly \nfrom the decision of an inferior judicial tribunal an appellate court will \npresume in review that it has complied with all the requirements of law, and \nthat its determination rested on facts sufficient to sustain them. The burden \nrests upon the appellant to rebut this presumption of regularity.\"<\/p>\n<p>In Barnes' Case (92 Va., 794, 803), the court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is also assigned as error by the accused that she was tried and convicted \nwithout the assistance of counsel in making her defense.<\/p>\n<p>\"The record does not show whether she had counsel or not; but if it showed \nthat she did not have counsel, unless it appeared that she was denied that \nright, it would not be ground for reversing the judgment. Every person accused \nof crime has a right to have counsel to aid him in making his defense, but no \none is compelled to have counsel. If a person accused of crime is able to employ \ncounsel, but declines to do so, and goes to trial without ^counsel, and is \nconvicted, that is no ground for reversing the judgment.<\/p>\n<p>\"If a prisoner is unable to employ counsel, the court may appoint some one to \ndefend him, and it is a duty which counsel owes to his profession, to the court \nengaged in the trial, to the administration of justice, and to humanity, not to \nwithhold his aid, nor spare his best efforts in the defense of one 'who has the \ndouble misfortune to be stricken with poverty and accused of crime. No one is at \nliberty to decline such an appointment, and few, it is to be hoped, would be \ndisposed to do so.' (Cooley's Const. Lim., 406,) But we cannot presume that the \ntrial court denied the prisoner her right to have counsel, or failed, if she \nwere unable to employ counsel, to assign some one to aid her in her \ndefense.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So it has been held that \"Where the record once shows the presence of the \nprisoner at his trial, it will be presumed to have continued to the end unless \nthe contrary is affirmatively shown. The presumption is, rather, that the trial \ncourt did its duty, than that it did not.\" (Folden <em>vs.<\/em> State, 13 Neb., \n328, 332.)<\/p>\n<p>And again: \"Another specification of error is, that the record does not show \nthat the prisoner had counsel at the trial. It is based upon an alleged \npresumption against the regularity of the proceedings\u2014a presumption directly \nopposite to that which we have shown to exist. It assumes that those rights of \nthe prisoner were denied to him, which the record does not show affirmatively \nwere granted. As well might it be assumed that the court charged the jury \nerroneously, and the Commonwealth be required to prove that the charge was in \nall points correct, even before it is attacked. The right to be heard by himself \nand counsel is doubtless a constitutional right, and if it had been denied there \nwould have been error; but we are not to presume that it was denied, because the \nrecord does not exhibit the fact that it was accorded. There are many rights of \nan accused person, some constitutional and others not, of which the record takes \nno notice\u2014such as the right to compulsory process for witnesses, the right to \ncall witnesses, or to cross-examine those,of the prosecution; and the right to \nbe heard by himself and counsel is one of them. The safety of the accused is not \nimperiled by the silence of the record; for, if any of these rights be denied, \nthere is an easy method of bringing upon the record the fact of the denial.\" \n(Cathcart <em>vs.<\/em> Commonwealth, 37 Pa. St., 108, 111.)<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Beale <em>vs.<\/em> Commonwealth (25 Pa. St., 11, 18), the \ncourt held: \"We are not to expect too much from the records of judicial \nproceedings. They are memorials of the judgments and decrees of the judges, and \ncontain a general but not a particular detail of all that occurs before them. If \nwe should insist on finding every fact fully recorded before a citizen can be \npunished for an offense against the laws, we should destroy public justice, and \ngive unbridled license to crime. Much must be left to intendment and \npresumption, for it is often less difficult to do things correctly than to \ndescribe them correctly.\"<\/p>\n<p>Before closing our discussion of the rule as applied to this case, we deem it \nproper to indicate that although we do not hold the omission of an affirmative \nentry in the record showing that the trial judge had advised the accused as to \nhis right to have counsel and that the accused had been asked if he desired the \naid of counsel to be reversible error, nevertheless we think that in all cases \nwherein the accused is not defended by counsel the record should be made to show \naffirmatively that the trial judge has complied with the provisions of the \nstatute in this regard. As was said by the supreme court of New Mexico, after \nmaking a somewhat similar ruling as to the effect in appellate proceedings of \nomissions from the record:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Notwithstanding this ruling, we would not advise that a custom so honored by \ntime and high authority should be disregarded under any circumstances.\" \n(Territory <em>vs.<\/em> Webb, 2 N. M., 147, 160.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The judgment entered in the court belpw convicting and sentencing the \ndefendants should be affirmed, with their respective share of the costs of this \ninstance against the appellants.

It appears that the said Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong died in the city of Manila on the 11th day of August, 1909. Accompanying said petition and attached thereto was the alleged will of the deceased. It appears that the will was signed by the deceased, as well as Anselmo Zacarias, Severo Tabora, and Timoteo Paez. <p>Said petition, after due notice was given, was brought on for hearing on the 18th day of September, 1909. At that hearing several witnesses were sworn. Timoteo Paez declared that he was 48 years of age; that he had known the said Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong; that she had died on the 11th day of August, 1909; that before her death she had executed a last will and testament; that he was present at the time of the execution of the same; that he had signed the will as a witness; that Anselmo Zacarias and Severo Tabora had also signed said will as witnesses and that they had signed the will in the presence of the deceased.<\/p> <p>Pablo Agustin also declared as a witness and said that he was 40 years of age; that he knew Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong during her lifetime; that she died on the 11th day of August, 1909, in the city of Manila; that before her death she had executed a last will and testament; that he was present at the time said last will was executed; that there were also present Timoteo Paez and Severo Tabora and a person called Anselmo; that the said Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong signed the will in the presence of the witnesses; that he had seen her sign the will with his own eyes; that the witnesses had signed the will in the presence of the said Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong and in the presence of each other; that the said Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong signed the will voluntarily, and in his judgment, she was in the possession of her faculties; that there were no threats or intimidation used to induce her to sign the will; that she signed it voluntarily.<\/p> <p>No further witnesses were called and there was no further opposition presented to the legalization of the said will.<\/p> <p>After hearing the foregoing witnesses, the Honorable A. S. Crossfield, judge, on the 29th day of September, 1909, ordered that the last will and testament of Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong be allowed and admitted to probate. The will was attached to the record and marked Exhibit A. The court further ordered that one Yap Tua be appointed as executor of the will, upon the giving of a bond, the amount of which was to be fixed later.<\/p> <p>From the record it appears that no further proceedings were had until the 28th of February, 1910, when Yap Ca Kuan and Yap Ca Llu appeared and presented a petition, alleging that they were interested in the matters of the said will and desired to intervene and asked that a guardian <em>ad litem<\/em> be appointed to represent them in the cause.<\/p> <p>On the 1st day of March, 1910, the court appointed Gabriel La O as guardian <em>ad litem<\/em> of said parties. Gabriel La O accepted said appointment, took the oath of office and entered upon the performance of his duties as guardian <em>ad litem<\/em> of said parties. On the 2d day of March, 1910, the said Gabriel La O appeared in court and presented a motion in which he alleged, in substance:<\/p> <p>First. That the will dated the 11th day of August, 1909, and admitted to probate by order of the court on the 29th day of September, 1909, was null, for the following reasons:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"(<em>a<\/em>) Because the same had not been authorized nor signed by the witnesses as the law prescribes.<\/p> <p>\"(<em>b<\/em>) Because at the time of the execution of the will, the said Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong was not then mentally capacitated to execute the same, due to her sickness.<\/p> <p>\"(<em>c<\/em>) Because her signature to the will had been obtained through fraud and illegal influence upon the part of persons who were to receive a benefit from the same, and because the said Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong had no intention of executing the same.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>Second. That before the execution of the said will, which they alleged to be null, the said Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong had executed another will, with all the formalities required by law, upon the 6th day of August, 1909.<\/p> <p>Third. That the said Yap Ca Kuan and Yap Ca Llu were minors and that, even though they had been negligent in presenting their opposition to the legalization of the will said negligence was excusable, on account of their age.<\/p> <p>Upon the foregoing facts the court was requested to annul and set aside the order of the 29th day of September, 1909, and to grant to said minors an opportunity to present new proof relating to the due execution of said will. Said petition was based upon the provisions of section 113 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.<\/p> <p>While it is not clear from the record, apparently the said minors in their petition for a new trial, attached to said petition the alleged will of August 6, 1909, of the said Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong, and the affidavits of Severo Tabora, Clotilde and Cornelia Serrano.<\/p> <p>Upon the 10th day of March, 1910, upon the hearing of said motion for a rehearing, the Honorable A. S. Crossfield, judge, granted said motion and ordered that the rehearing should take place upon the 18th day of March, 1910, and directed that notice should be given to the petitioners of said rehearing and to all other persons interested in the will. At the rehearing a number of witnesses were examined.<\/p> <p>It will be remembered that one of the grounds upon which the new trial was requested was that the deceased, Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong, had not signed the will (Exhibit A) of the 11th of August, 1909; that in support of that allegation, the protestants, during the rehearing, presented a witness called Tomas Puzon. Puzon testified that he was a professor and an expert in handwriting, and upon being shown the will (of August 11, 1909) Exhibit A, testified that the name and surname on Exhibit A, in his judgment were written by two different hands, though the given name is the same as that upon Exhibit 1 (the will of August 6, 1909), because he found in the name \"Tomasa\" on Exhibit A a similarity in the tracing to the \"Tomasa\" in Exhibit 1; that comparing the surname on Exhibit A with the surname on Exhibit 1 he found that the character of the writing was thoroughly distinguished and different by the tracing and by the direction of the letters in the said two exhibits; that from his experience and observation he believed that the name \"Tomasa\" and \"Yap Caong,\" appearing in the signature on Exhibit A were written by different persons.<\/p> <p>Puzon, being cross-questioned with reference to his capacity as an expert in handwriting, testified that while he was a student in the Ateneo de Manila, he had studied penmanship; that he could not tell exactly when that was, except that he had concluded his course in the year 1882; that since that time he had been a telegraph operator for seventeen years and that he had acted as an expert in handwriting in the courts in the provinces.<\/p> <p>Gabriel La O was called as a witness during the rehearing and testified that he had drawn the will of the 6th of August, 1909, at the request of Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong; that it it was drawn in accordance with her request and under her directions; that she had signed it; that the same had been signed by three witnesses in her presence and in the presence of each other; that the will was written in her house; that she was sick and was lying in her bed, but that she sat up to sign the will; that she signed the will with great difficulty; that she was in her right mind.<\/p> <p>The said Severo Tabora was also called as a witness again during the rehearing. He testified that he knew Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong during her lifetime; that she was dead; that his signature as a witness to Exhibit A (the will of August 11, 1909) was placed there by him; that the deceased, Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong, became familiar with the contents of the will because she signed it before he (the witness) did; that he did not know whether anybody there told her to sign the will or not; that he signed two wills; that he did not know La O; that he did not believe that Tomasa had signed the will (Exhibit A) before he arrived at the house; that he was not sure that he had seen Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong sign Exhibit A because there were many people and there was a screen at the door and he could not see; that he was called as a witness to sign the second will and was told by the people there that it was the same as the patient, in the house but outside the room where the patient was; that the will was signed by Paez and himself; that Anselmo Zacarias was there; that he was not sure whether Anselmo Zacarias signed the will or not; that he was not sure whether Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong could see the table on which the will was written at the time it was signed or not; that there were many people in the house; that he remembered the names of Pedro and Lorenzo; that he could not remember the names of any others; that the will remained on the table after he signed it; that after he signed the will he went into the room where Tomasa was lying; that the will was left on the table outside; that Tomasa was very ill; that he heard the people asking Tomasa to sign the will after he (the witness) had signed it; that he saw Paez sign the will; that he could not remember whether Anselmo Zacarias had signed the will, because immediately after he and Paez signed it, he left because he was hungry; that the place where the table was located was in the same house, on the floor, about two steps down from the floor on which Tomasa was.<\/p> <p>Rufino R. Papa was called as a witness for the purpose of supporting the allegation that Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong was mentally incapacitated to make the will dated August 11, 1909 (Exhibit A). Papa declared that he was a physician; that he knew Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong; that he had treated her in the month of August; that he visited her first on the 8th day of August; that he visited her again on the 9th and 10th days of August; that on the first visit he found the sick woman completely weak\u2014very weak from her sickness, in the third stage of tuberculosis; that she was lying in bed; that on the first visit he found her with but little sense, the second day also, and on the third day she had lost all her intelligence; that she died on the 11th of August; that he was requested to issue the death certificate; that when he asked her (Tomasa) whether she was feeling any pain or anything of that kind, she did not answer at all; that she was in a condition of stupor, induced, as he believed, by the stage of uraemia from which she was suffering.<\/p> <p>Anselmo Zacarias, who had signed the will of August 11, 1909, was also called as a witness during the rehearing. He testified that he had known Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong since he was a child; that Tomasa was dead; that he had written the will Exhibit A; that it was all in his writing except the last part, which was written by Carlos Sobaco; that he had written the will Exhibit A at the request of the uncle of Tomasa; that Lorenzo, the brother of the deceased, was the one who had instructed him as to the terms of the will; that the deceased had not spoken to him concerning the terms of the will; that the will was written in the dining room of the residence of the deceased; that Tomasa was in another room different from that in which the will was written; that the will was not written in the presence of Tomasa; that he signed the will as a witness in the room where Tomasa was lying; that the other witnesses signed the will in the same room; that when he went into the room where the sick woman was (Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong) Lorenzo had the will in his hands; that when Lorenzo came to the bed he showed the will to his sister (Tomasa) and requested her to sign it; that she was lying stretched out on the bed and two women, who were taking care of her, helped her to sit up, supporting her by placing their hands at her back; that when she started to write her name, he withdrew from the bed on account of the heat inside the room; when he came back again to the sick bed the will was signed and was again in the hands of Lorenzo; that he did not see Tomasa sign the will because he withdrew from the room; that he did not know whether Tomasa had been informed of the contents of the will or not; he supposed she must have read it because Lorenzo turned the will over to her; that when Lorenzo asked her to sign the will, he did not know what she said\u2014he could not hear her voice; that he did not know whether the sick woman saw him sign the will or not; that he believed that Tomasa died the next day after the will had been signed; that the other two witnesses, Timoteo Paez and Severo Tabora, had signed the will in the room with the sick woman; that he saw them sign the will and that they saw him sign it; that he was not sure whether the testatrix could have seen them at the time they signed the will or not; that there was a screen before the bed; that he did not think that Lorenzo had been giving instructions as to the contents of the will; that about ten or fifteen minutes elapsed from the time Lorenzo handed the will to Tomasa before she started to sign it; that the pen with which she signed the will was given to her and she held it.<\/p> <p>Clotilde Mariano testified that he was a cigarette maker; that he knew Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong and that she was dead; that she had made two wills; that the first one was written by La O and the second by Zacarias; that he was present at the time Zacarias wrote the second one; that he was present when the second will was taken to Tomasa for signature; that Lorenzo had told Tomasa that the second will was exactly like the first; that Tomasa said she could not sign it.<\/p> <p>On cross examination he testified that there was a lot of visitors there; that Zacarias was not there; that Paez and Tabora were there; that he had told Tomasa that the second will was exactly like the first.<\/p> <p>During the rehearing Cornelia Serrano and Pedro Francisco were also examined as witnesses. There is nothing in their testimony, however, which in our opinion is important.<\/p> <p>In rebuttal Julia de la Cruz was called as a witness. She testified that she was 19 years of age; that she knew Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong during her lifetime; that she lived in the house of Tomasa during the last week of her illness; that Tomasa had made two wills; that she was present when the second one was executed; that a lawyer had drawn the will in the dining room and after it had been drawn and everything finished, it was taken to where Do\u00f1a Tomasa was, for her signature; that it was taken to her by Anselmo Zacarias; that she was present at the time Tomasa signed the will; that there were many other people present also; that she did not see Timoteo Paez there; that she saw Severo Tabora; that Anselmo Zacarias was present; that she did not hear Clotilde Mariano ask Tomasa to sign the will; that she did not hear Lorenzo say to Tomasa that the second will was the same as the first; that Tomasa asked her to help her to sit up and to put a pillow to her back when Zacarias gave her some paper or document and asked her to sign it; that she saw Tomasa take hold of the pen and try to sign it but she did not see the place she signed the document, for the reason that she left the room; that she saw Tomasa sign the document but did not see on what place on the document she signed; that she heard Tomasa ask for another notary public and that a notary public came the next morning; that Tomasa was able to move about in the bed; that she had seen Tomasa in the act of starting to write her signature when she told her to get her some water.<\/p> <p>Yap Cao Quiang was also called as a witness in rebuttal. He testified that he knew Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong and knew that she had made a will; that he saw the will at the time it was written; that he saw Tomasa sign it on her bed; that he did not hear Lorenzo ask Tomasa to sign the will; that Lorenzo had handed the will to Tomasa to sign; that he saw the witnesses sign the will on a table near the bed; that the table was outside the curtain or screen and near the entrance to the room where Tomasa was lying.<\/p> <p>Lorenzo Yap Caong testified as a witness on rebuttal. He said that he knew Anselmo Zacarias and that Zacarias wrote the will of Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong; that Tomasa had given him instructions; that Tomasa had said that she wanted to make another will; that he had seen the witnesses sign the will; that the will was on a table near the bed of Tomasa; that Tomasa, from where she was lying in the bed, could see the table where the witnesses had signed the will.<\/p> <p>During the rehearing certain other witnesses were also examined; in our opinion, however, it is unnecessary to quote from them for the reason that their testimony in no way affects the preponderance of proof above quoted.<\/p> <p>At the close of the rehearing the Honorable A. S. Crossfield, judge, in an extended opinion, reached the conclusion that the last will and testament of Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong, which was attached to the record and marked Exhibit A was the last will and testament of the said Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong and admitted it to probate and ordered that the administrator theretofore appointed should continue as such administrator. From that order the protestants appealed to this court, and made the following assignments of error:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"I. The court erred in declaring that the will, Exhibit A, was executed by the deceased Tomasa Yap Caong, without the intervention of any external influence on the part of other persons.<\/p> <p>\"II. The court erred in declaring that the testator had clear knowledge and knew what she was doing at the time of signing the will.<\/p> <p>\"III. The court erred in declaring that the signature of the deceased Tomasa Yap Caong in the first will, Exhibit 1, is identical with that which appears in the second will, Exhibit A.<\/p> <p>\"IV. The court erred in declaring that the will, Exhibit A, was executed in accordance with the law.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>With reference to the first assignment of error, to wit, that undue influence was brought to bear upon Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong in the execution of her will of August 11th, 1909 (Exhibit A), the lower court found that no undue influence had been exercised over the mind of the said Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong. While it is true that some of the witnesses testified that the brother of Tomasa, one Lorenzo, had attempted to unduly influence her mind in the execution of her will, upon the other hand, there were several witnesses who testified that Lorenzo did not attempt, at the time of the execution of the will, to influence her mind in any way. The lower court having had an opportunity to see, to hear, and to note the witnesses during their examination, reached the conclusion that a preponderance of the evidence showed that no undue influence had been used. We find no good reason in the record for reversing his conclusions upon that question.<\/p> <p>With reference to the second assignment of error, to wit, that Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong was not of sound mind and memory at the time of the execution of the will, we find the same conflict in the declarations of the witnesses which we found with reference to the undue influence. While the testimony of Dr. Papa is very strong relating to the mental condition of Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong, yet, nevertheless, his testimony related to a time perhaps twenty-four hours before the execution of the will in question (Exhibit A). Several witnesses testified that at the time the will was presented to her for her signature, she was of sound mind and memory and asked for a pen and ink and kept the will in her possession for ten or fifteen minutes and finally signed it. The lower court found that there was a preponderance of evidence sustaining the conclusion that Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong was of sound mind and memory and in the possession of her faculties at the time she signed this will. In view of the conflict in the testimony of the witnesses and the finding of the lower court, we do not feel justified in reversing his conclusions upon that question.<\/p> <p>With reference to the third assignment of error, to wit, that the lower court committed an error in declaring that the signature of Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong, on her first will (August 6, 1909, Exhibit 1), is identical with that which appears in the second will (August 11, 1909, Exhibit A), it may be said:<\/p> <p>First. That whether or not Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong executed the will of August 6, 1909 (Exhibit 1), was not the question presented to the court. The question presented was whether or not she had duly executed the will of August 11, 1909 (Exhibit A).<\/p> <p>Second. There appears to be but little doubt that Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong did execute the will of August 6, 1909. Several witnesses testified to that fact. The mere fact, however, that she executed a former will is no proof that she did not execute a later will. She had a perfect right, by will, to dispose of her property, in accordance with the provisions of law, up to the very last of moment her life. She had a perfect right to change, alter, modify or revoke any and all of her former wills and to make a new one. Neither will the fact that the new will fails to expressly revoke all former wills, in any way sustain the charge that she did not make the new will.<\/p> <p>Third. In said third assignment of error there is involved in the statement that \"The signature of Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong, in her first will (Exhibit 1) was not identical with that which appears in her second will (Exhibit A)\" the inference that she had not signed the second will and all the argument of the appellants relating to said third assignment of error is based upon the alleged fact that Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong did not sign Exhibit A. Several witnesses testified that they saw her write the name \"Tomasa.\" One of the witnesses testified that she had written her full name. We are of the opinion, and we think the law sustains our conclusion, that if Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong signed any portion of her name to the will, with the intention to sign the same, that that will amount to a signature. It has been held time and time again that one who makes a will may sign the same by using a mark, the name having been written by others. If writing a mark simply upon a will is sufficient indication of the intention of the person to make and execute a will, then certainly the writing of a portion or all of her name ought to be accepted as a clear indication of her intention to execute the will. (<em>Re<\/em> Goods of Savory, 15 Jur., 1042; Addy <em>vs<\/em>. Grix, 8 Ves. Jr., 504; Baker <em>vs<\/em>. Dening, 8 Ad. &amp; El., 94; Long <em>vs<\/em>. Zook, 13 Penn., 400; Vernon <em>vs<\/em>.

Ryder, 84 Penn., 217.)<\/p> <p>We find a very interesting case reported in 131 Pennsylvania State, 220 (6 L. R. A., 353), and cited by the appellees, which was known as \"Knox's Appeal.\" In this case one Harriett S. Knox died very suddenly on the 17th of October, 1888, at the residence of her father. After her death a paper was found in her room, wholly in her handwriting, written with a lead pencil, upon three sides of an ordinary folded sheet of note paper and bearing the signature simply of \"Harriett.\" In this paper the deceased attempted to make certain disposition of her property. The will was presented for probate. The probation was opposed upon the ground that the same did not contain the signature of the deceased. That was the only question presented to the court, whether the signature, in the form above indicated, was a sufficient signature to constitute said paper the last will and testament of Harriett S. Knox. It was admitted that the entire paper was in the handwriting of the deceased. In deciding that question, Justice Mitchell said:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"The precise case of a signature <em>by the first name only,<\/em> does not appear to have arisen either in England or the United States; but the principle on which the decisions already referred to were based, especially those in regard to signing by initials only, are equally applicable to the present case, and additional force is given to them by the decisions as to what constitutes a binding signature to a contract. (Palmer <em>vs<\/em>. Stephens, 1 Denio, 478; Sanborne <em>vs<\/em>. Flager, 9 Allen, 474; Weston <em>vs<\/em>. Myers, 33 Ill., 424; Salmon Falls, etc. Co. <em>vs<\/em>. Goddard, 14 How. (U. S.), 446.)\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>The man who cannot write and who is obliged to make his mark simply therefor, upon the will, is held to \"sign\" as effectually as if he had written his initials or his full name. It would seem to be sufficient, under the law requiring a signature by the person making a will, to make his mark, to place his initials or all or any part of his name thereon. In the present case we think the proof shows, by a large preponderance, that Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong, if she did not sign her full name, did at least sign her given name \"Tomasa,\" and that is sufficient to satisfy the statute.<\/p> <p>With reference to the fourth assignment of error, it maybe said that the argument which has preceded is sufficient to answer it also.<\/p> <p>During the trial of the cause the protestants made a strong effort to show that Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong did not sign her name in the presence of the witnesses and that they did not sign their names in her presence nor in the presence of each other. Upon that question there is considerable conflict of proof. An effort was made to show that the will was signed by the witnesses in one room and by Tomasa in another. A plan of the room or rooms in which the will was signed was presented as proof and it was shown that there was but one room; that one part of the room was one or two steps below the floor of the other; that the table on which the witnesses signed the will was located upon the lower floor of the room. It was also shown that from the bed in which Tomasa was lying, it was possible for her to see the table on which the witnesses signed the will. While the rule is absolute that one who makes a will must sign the same in the presence of the witnesses and that the witnesses must sign in the presence of each other, as well as in the presence of the one making the will, yet, nevertheless, the actual seeing of the signatures made is not necessary. It is sufficient if the signatures are made where it is possible for each of the necessary parties, if they desire to see, may see the signatures placed upon the will.<\/p> <p>In cases like the present where there is so much conflict in the proof, it is very difficult for the courts to reach conclusions that are absolutely free from doubt. Great weight must be given by appellate courts who do not see or hear the witnesses, to the conclusions of the trial courts who had that opportunity.<\/p> <p>Upon a full consideration of the record, we find that a preponderance of the proof shows that Tomasa Elizaga Yap Caong did execute, freely and voluntarily, while she was in the right use of all of her faculties, the will dated August 11, 1909 (Exhibit A). Therefore the judgment of the lower court admitting said will to probate is hereby affirmed with costs.<\/p> <p><em>Arellano, C.

He claims that his father gave him the land as a \nwedding gift, the father having purchased it in 1901 from the original owners; \nthat by virtue of an oral agreement between his father and the defendants, made \nat the time when his father purchased the land, the defendant Abundo and the \npredecessor in interest of the defendant Quindara secured permission to build \nthe houses on this land now occupied by them, under an oral agreement to pay an \nannual rental of 15 <em>manojos<\/em> of rice for each house, and to surrender \npossession on demand.\n<p>A deed of sale of certain real estate to the father of the plaintiff for the \nsum of 100 pesos was introduced in evidence, and certain witnesses were called \nwho claimed that they were present when the deed was executed, at which time, as \nthey allege, the oral understanding was entered into by which permission, was \ngiven for the erection of the defendants' houses under the alleged rental \nagreement.<br\/><\/p>\n<p>The defendants and their witnesses testified that their houses had been built \nlong prior to the date of the alleged sale to plaintiff's father, and that these \nhouses together with the land on which they stand had been occupied by them and \ntheir predecessors in interest ever since under claim of ownership.<\/p>\n<p>The evidence of the plaintiff in support of his claim of ownership is in the \nhighest degree unsatisfactory, and to our minds it wholly fails to establish \ntitle to the land in question. It is not by any means clear that the land in \nquestion is the land referred to in the private deed to plaintiff's father; and \neven if it be granted that it is, the evidence in support of title in the vendor \nis not convincing. Indeed, it fails utterly to establish even a better right to \npossession in plaintiff or his predecessors in interest than that of defendants \nand their predecessors in interest, unless we accept the testimony of the \nwitnesses touching the alleged rental contract.<\/p>\n<p>In support of plaintiff's allegations as to the alleged rental contract we \nhave the testimony of plaintiff himself, and that of some of his witnesses who \nclaim to have been present at the time when the deed of sale was executed, at \nwhich time it is said the oral agreement was entered into. But this testimony is \nvague, uncertain and indefinite, and falls far short of being sufficient to \nestablish the existence of such an oral agreement.<\/p>\n<p>Defendants and their predecessors in interest have been in possession of \ntheir houses and of the land on which they are constructed for more than ten \nyears. There is not a particle of evidence of record which even tends to prove \nthat they ever paid any rent during all that period, On the contrary, plaintiff \nadmits that they refused so to do, and that they have persistently denied his \nclaim of ownership and insisted that they themselves are the owners of these \nhouses and the land on which they are built. The defendants claim that they have \nalways paid the taxes on the land in question, and the official tax receipts \ncorroborate their claim, at least as far back as 1908. If the testimony as to \nthe alleged oral rental contract were true it would seem that it would have been \npossible for plaintiff to offer evidence tending to support his claim that these \ndefendants held the land in question under an agreement to pay rent therefor. \nBut the only evidence in this regard is the testimony of one witness who swore \nthat in 1908 and again in 1910 one of the defendants borrowed money from him, \nand told him that he needed the money to pay his rent to the plaintiff for the \nuse of the land on which his house stood. But the probability that this witness \nspoke the truth is put in doubt by the testimony of the plaintiff himself, who \nswore that in both those years this defendant refused absolutely to pay any \nrent, and denied the right of plaintiff to demand it.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff in an action of ejectment must show by a preponderance of the \nevidence a good and valid title or interest in the premises, and can only \nrecover possession on the strength of his own title, and not because of the \nweakness or want of title in the defendants.<\/p>\n<p>On the whole record we are well satisfied that plaintiff has failed to \nestablish his title by a preponderance of the evidence, and we conclude \ntherefore that the judgment of the court below should be reversed, without costs \nto either party in this instance, and that the complaint should be dismissed \nwithout day.

HONORIO NUEVACOBETA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<\/title>The defendant was convicted of the crime of estafa in that he fraudulently \nconverted to his own use the sum of P110 belonging to Leoncio Mordice. The only \nquestions at issue have to do with the credibility of the various witnesses \ncalled at the trial.\n<p>The evidence for the prosecution is substantially as follows. Leoncio Mordice \nreturned home one night in an intoxicated condition and became angry with his \nwife when he discovered that the evening meal was not ready. Terrified, she left \nthe house and did not return for fifteen days. She went to the home of the \nlieutenant of the barrio, who took her to the home of the defendant, the latter \nbeing a councilman of the municipality. Nuevacobeta told her she should file a \ncomplaint against her husband for maltreatment, and on her refusal, he \nthreatened to put her in jail unless she did so. The defendant talked to the \njustice of the peace about filing- a complaint against Mordice on five different \noccasions, once in the private residence of the Justice of the peace and twice \nat his office, unaccompanied by the woman, and twice accompanied by her. On his \nfirst visit in company with the woman, the Justice of the peace directed her to \ncall her witnesses. On her second visit in company with the defendant she \nbrought some witnesses with her and on this occasion, after examining into the \nfacts, the justice refused to issue a warrant on the ground that no offense had \nbeen committed. The defendant, however, told Gabina Pajarito, an old woman who \nlived with Mordice and who went to see the defendant on behalf of the husband, \nthat Mordice would be imprisoned for one year and seven months and have to pay a \nfine of P100, and costs, unless he could find P50 to be delivered to the \n:justice of the peace for dismissing the complaint. The old woman promised to \ntry to secure the money. A few days later the defendant came to Mordice's house \nand there repeated what he had said to the old woman, whereupon Mordice agreed \nto sell his carabao in order to raise the money. The defendant took the \nregistration certificate of the carabao away with him, saying that he himself \nwould endeavor to find a purchaser for the carabao. On the evening of the next \nday the carabao was brought to the municipal building and sold to Daniel Murillo \nfor P125. Murillo paid that amount, less P15, to the defendant on the upper \nfloor of the municipal building in the presence of Mordice. The difference of \nP15 represented a loan or advance to the defendant made by the purchaser that \nmorning. Murillo told the defendant to look after the balance himself. The \ndefendant thereupon told Mordice that he should come down to his (the \ndefendant's) house where they would settle the matter. When Mordice arrived at \nthe defendant's house, the latter paid him P15 which Mordice accepted under \nprotest, claiming that he should be given the balance, less P50, which he \nunderstood was to be paid to the Justice of the peace for dismissing the \ncomplaint against him. About a week later, accompanied by Gregorio Era, Mordice \ncame to the defendant's house and again asked him for the balance due, but on \nthat occasion the defendant told him he would have to wait a while as he had \nalready spent the money. Mordice replied that he would not leave until he had \nreceived it, and the defendant immediately left. Mordice and Era waited for him \nto come back until 4 o'clock in the afternoon, but as he did not return they \nthen left.<\/p>\n<p>As to the trouble between Mordice and his wife, the intervention of the \ndefendant and his accompanying her to the justice of the peace to file a \ncomplaint against her husband; as to the sale of the carabao to Murillo for the \nsum of P125 and the advance made earlier in the day by Murillo to the defendant, \nand the fact that Murillo only paid P110 at the time the sale was completed in \nthe municipal building; and as to the payment of P15 by the defendant to Mordice \nin the former's house a few hours later, the theory of the defense agrees with \nthat of the prosecution. But the defendant denied that he had threatened the \nwoman in order to make her file a complaint against her husband; or that he had \nthreatened Mordice in order to secure from him P50 to have the alleged \nprosecution against him dismissed, He swore that he paid over to Mordice the sum \nof P110 in the municipal building immediately after it had been handed him by \nMurillo, although the latter was not present at that time. He also denied that \nMordice protested a few hours later when he received the balance of paid at the \ndefendant's house. And he asserted that the present case is the indirect outcome \nof a political quarrel between himself and one Clasico Tanjanlangit.<\/p>\n<p>As to the evidence of the prosecution that the defendant appeared at \nMordice's house and informed him that he would he punished with imprisonment and \na fine unless he secured P50 to be paid the justice of the peace, we have the \ntestimony of Mordice, the old woman, Gabina Pajarito, and Gregorio Era. Mordice \ngathered tuba for Era and the latter was at Mordice's house at that time on \nbusiness. There were no witnesses to the alleged transfer in the municipal \nbuilding of the P110 by the defendant to Mordice immediately after Murillo left \nthem, so that we have only the conflicting testimony of the defendant and \nMordice on this point. Teodoro Naragdad, conceded by both sides to have \nwitnessed the delivery of the P15 to Mordice at the defendant's house, testified \nthat Mordice did protest that there was more due him. This directly contradicts \nthe defendant on this point. It is to be noted also that Naragdad was called as \na witness by the defense. The old woman Gabina Pajarito testified that Mordice \nreturned home that evening with only P15. The evidence of these two witnesses \ntends at least to show that the defendant did not turn over the P110 to Mordice \nin the municipal building.<\/p>\n<p>The purchaser of the carabao, Daniel Murillo, testified that he left Mordice \nand the defendant in the municipal building, and went down-stairs to the \nmunicipal stables to get the carabao where he met Gregorio Era, whom he told to \ntake the carabao to the home of his new owner. As he returned from the stables \nhe met Mordice with the P110 in his hands and Mordice asked for the remaining \nP15, which Murillo refused to give him. Gregorio favorito also testified that he \nwitnessed the conversation between Mordice and Murillo and saw a roll of paper \nmoney in Mordice's hand, which the latter said amounted to P110. It is clear \nthat if this testimony be true, the defendant should be acquitted. But we are of \nopinion that the lower court was justified in refusing to believe either of \nthese witnesses. As to Murillo, an affidavit signed by him was introduced in \nevidence in which he details the facts related above as to the purchase of the \ncarabao through the intervention of the defendant and his advance to the latter \non the morning of the sale of P15, and his delivery of the remaining P110 to the \ndefendant in the municipal building that afternoon, but no mention is made in \nthis affidavit of the conversation had between him and Mordice a few minutes \nlater, during which Murillo claims to have seen the P110 in Mordice's hands. \nThis affidavit was prepared after Mordice had complained to the authorities \nregarding the withholding by the defendant of the sum claimed to be still due \nhim from the sale of the carabao. Clasico Tanjanlangit testified that Mordice \ncomplained to him against the defendant and that he thereupon called Murillo to \nhis house and, after questioning him, the two went to the justice of the peace \nwhere Murillo made the affidavit in question. Murillo testified that \nTanjanlangit called him to his house by means of a note which read, \"Dear Ani: I \nwill be glad if you can come around to my house any time today because we have \nto talk about one good thing.\" Upon coming to Tanjanlangit's house the latter \ntold Him he would have to testify for Mordice or he would be complained against. \nHe first said that Tanjanlangit merely told him to tell the truth, but later \nsaid that Tanjanlangit told him to testify in favor of Mordice. If this were \ntrue it would explain how the fact of the conversation outside the municipal \nbuilding between him and Mordice, during which he saw P110 in the latter's hands \ncame to be omitted from the affidavit. But upon being questioned at the trial as \nto why this was left out of the affidavit, his only reply was that it was \nbecause the justice of the peace had not asked him what occurred outside the \nmunicipal building. If the affidavit spoke the truth, it is certain that no such \nconversation occurred, for the reason that at the time of its making the affiant \nwas fully informed of the fact that Mordice was complaining because the money \nhad not been turned over to him. If it did not speak the truth and the alleged \nconversation outside the municipal building did take place, there was no reason \nfor the affiant saying at the trial, that the reason it was omitted from the \naffidavit was because the Justice of the peace had not asked him about it, when \nthe real reason was that it had been suppressed through the influence of \nTanjanlangit. As to the testimony of Gregorio Favorito regarding this alleged \nconversation, it is worthy of note that Murillo, who was called first, made no \nmention of his being present when it occurred. Furthermore the two disagreed as \nto the substance of what was said during this alleged meeting, and from a more \ngeneral view of the whole matter it seems improbable, at least, that immediately \nafter consenting to go to the defendant's house to get the remaining P15, as \ntestified by the defendant, Mordice should rush out of the municipal building \nand demand that amount of Murillo.<\/p>\n<p>As to the political animosity between Tanjanlangit and this defendant, the \nlatter testified that it arose from the fact that he had objected to \nTanjanlangit's using the municipal typewriter for private purposes without \npaying the rate of 10 centavos per hundred words which was established by a town \nordinance. It may be true that this matter rankled in Tanjanlangit's breast and \nthat when Mordice came to him and exposed the defendant's duplicity, he was glad \nto assist in pressing the prosecution against him. But the facts against the \naccused are marshalled in too orderly and convincing a manner and come from too \nmany independent witnesses, and his defense is too self-contradictory and \nimprobable for us to believe that the charge against him has no foundation in \nfact, and was concocted out of the whole cloth by a political adversary.<\/p>\n<p>After a careful review of the entire record, we have no hesitancy in arriving \nat the conclusion that the findings of fact by the lower court should not be \ndisturbed. We find no error in the proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the \naccused. The Judgment entered in the lower court convicting and sentencing him \nshould, therefore, be affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the \nappellant.<\/p>\n<p>It is so ordered.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

It \nfurther appears that no notice was sent defendants or their counsel, who were \nresidents of the Province of Cebu, and that they did not have actual notice of \nthe date set for the trial. It nowhere appears that either the defendants or \ntheir counsel had any knowledge of the above-mentioned rule of practice adopted \nin the Court of First Instance of Manila.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Muerteguy &amp; Aboitiz<em> vs.<\/em> Delgado (22 Phil. Rep., \n109), we recognized as one of the most elementary rules in the administration of \njustice that \"Parties have a right to be present at the trial of their causes, \neither by themselves or by their attorneys. They are also entitled to reasonable \nnotice of the time fixed for trial.\"<\/p>\n<p>Manifestly, the defendants in this case were entitled to a new trial unless, \nunder the above-mentioned rule of practice adopted in the Courts of First \nInstance of Manila, they can be said to have had constructive notice of the date \nset for the trial of this case.<\/p>\n<p>Section 6 of Act No. 190 provides the conditions under which rules of court \nmay be adopted in this jurisdiction so as to bind the litigants and their \ncounsel. It is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The judges of the Supreme Court shall prepare rules regulating the conduct \nof business in the Supreme Court and in the Courts of First Instance. The rules \nshall be uniform for all Courts of First Instance throughout the Islands. Such \nrules, when duly made and promulgated and not in conflict with the laws of the \nUnited States or of the Philippine Islands, shall be binding and must be \nobserved, but no judgment shall be reversed by reason of a failure of the court \nto comply with such rules unless the substantial rights of a party have been \nimpaired by such failure.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The rule in question has not been put in force as provided in this section. \nIt has no uniform application throughout this jurisdiction. Indeed it is in \ndirect conflict with the practice followed in many of the courts throughout the \nIslands wherein actual notice is always required under the circumstances wherein \nthe Manila rule undertakes to do away with the necessity therefor. Without \ndeciding how far a rule of practice of this character can be held to be binding \nupon counsel or litigants who are affirmatively shown to have been advised of \nits existence, it is very clear that it can have no effect to deprive any person \nwho is unacquainted with its existence of any right to which he would be \nentitled in the absence of the rule. Defendants and their counsel were clearly \nentitled to notice of the date of the trial, unless they can be charged with \nconstructive notice under the rule in question. It does not appear that they \nwere advised of the existence of the rule, and we are of opinion and so hold \nthat it was reversible error to proceed with the trial in the absence of notice \nto the defendants or their counsel, and that the new trial, which was prayed for \nin the court below, should have been granted.<\/p>\n<p>It appears that some time prior to the hearing of the application for a new \ntrial the amount of the judgment was paid, and it is contended that the amount \nof the judgment having been paid there remained at that time, in the language of \nthe trial judge, \"no actual controversy or right to new trial or appeal.\" It \nappears, however, that by special order of the trial judge, execution was issued \non the judgment and manifestly payment made under such conditions cannot be \ngiven the effect of a voluntary settlement putting an end to the litigation.<\/p>\n<p>Under the provisions of section 443 of Act No. 190 the trial judge is \nexpressly authorized to issue execution immediately upon the entry of final \njudgment; but the right so to do should not be construed so as to deprive the \ndefendant of his rights to a new trial and appeal, in the event that the amount \nof the judgment is recovered under the levy of the execution, or paid by the \ndefendant in order to avoid the costs, expense and damage which would \nnecessarily result from the levy of the execution.<\/p>\n<p>The judgement entered in the court below should be reversed and a new trial \ngranted, without costs in this instance. So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><em>Moreland, J.,<\/em> concurs in the result.<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/div>",

That the S. S. 'Tean,' engaged in the foreign trade of the Philippine \nIslands, was on November 2, 1911, seized for having on board unmanifested \ncontraband opium in violation of section 303 of Act No. 355, and on the same \ndate a notice of such seizure and of the fact that a hearing on same would be \nhad, was sent Messrs.

I., <em>November 13, 1911<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>\"This case arises by virtue of the provisions of section 313 of Act No. 355, \nas amended, and relates to the seizure of the S. S. 'Tean' for violation of \nsection 303 of Act No. 355.<\/p>\n<p>\"At a hearing had at this custom house on the 11th day of November, 1911, at \nwhich there were present the master and a representative of the agents of the \nvessel, it was found and determined that the S. S. 'Tean' is a vessel from a \nforeign port which arrived here consigned to Messrs. Smith, Bell &amp; Co., \nLtd., as local agents; that on the 31st day of October, 1911, agents of the \nBureau of Customs seized on board the steam launch 'Carmen,' 100 tins of \nprepared opium, part of 200 tins which had been taken on board said steam launch \nfrom the S. S. 'Tean' anchored in the bay, the other 100 tins having been thrown \noverboard into the Pasig River and subsequently recovered; that this opium had \nbeen delivered by the Chinese carpenter of the S. S. 'Tean' upon receipt of a \ncountersigned letter given him by one Alejandro Bautista; that said opium was \ncarried from the engine room and placed on board a banca alongside by three \nChinese persons under direction of the ship's carpenter; that the banca was \nmoved about 25 yards to where the steam launch 'Carmen' was anchored with all \nlights out, waiting for same; that the said steam launch then sailed up the \nPasig River and when opposite the customhouse a signal was given by one of the \nsecret service agents on board, and the same boarded by customs officers and the \nopium seized.<\/p>\n<p>\"At said hearing it was further found and determined that the value of the \nopium is $528 and that the duties due thereon amount to $184.80. Section 303 of \nAct No. 355 reads in part as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"'* * * if any merchandise be found \noit board any vessel from a foreign port which is not included in her manifests, \n* * * the master shall forfeit an amount equal to double the duties fixed \ntherefor: Provided always, That if it appears to the Collector that such \nomissions occurred with intent to defraud the revenue, the master shall in \naddition forfeit an amount equal to the value of the merchandise not manifested, \n* * *.'<\/p>\n<p>\"In reviewing the evidence, the undersigned finds that the opium was brought \nto the Philippine Islands on board the S. S. 'Tean;' that an article such as \nopium coming in such a large quantity as was discovered in this case, must be \nconsidered as merchandise, and therefore a part of the cargo of the vessel, \nwhether it came on board regularly manifested or not; that the master is \nresponsible if such merchandise is found on board unmanifested, and also for the \nsubordinate officers and men in so far as their actions affect the cargo of the \nvessel; that the fact such cargo was omitted from the manifest shows plainly an \nintention to defraud the revenues, and in conformity with the provisions of \nsection 303 of Act No. 355, a fine of P1,795.20 Philippine currency be imposed \non the master of the S. S. 'Tean.'<\/p>\n<p>\"Therefore it is adjudged and decreed that the master of the S. S. 'Tean' \nshall forfeit to the Government of the Philippine Islands the sum of P1,795.20 \nPhilippine currency, as provided in section 303 of Act No. 355 for foreign \nvessels arriving at ports of the Philippine Islands with unmanifested cargo on \nboard; that in default of prompt payment of said fine by the master or agents of \nsaid vessel, a warrant for the arrest and detention of said vessel issue, and \nthe vessel in question held for payment of the penalty, as provided in section \n343 of Act No. 355; and that the bond therefor be fixed at P3,000 Philippine \ncurrency.<\/p>\n<p align=\"right\">(Signed) \"H.

W. FERRIER,<br\/><em>\"Attorney for plaintiff.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The dispositive part of the opinion filed by the trial judge is as follows: \n\"It is accordingly considered and adjudged that the fine of P1,795.20, found to \nbe proper by the Insular Collector of Customs, be imposed upon the defendant, in \naccordance with Act No. 355, section 303; and that in default of payment thereof \nthe said Steamship 'Tean' be sold, after due advertisement, to satisfy this \njudgment and the costs of the proceeding, which are further taxed against the \ndefendant.\"<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for appellant insists that, \"The question presented is exactly that \nwhich would be raised by a demurrer, except that the decision will be final, and \nthe court need only read the complaint and determine whether or not it states a \ncause of action;\" and that the petition filed by the Collector does not recite \nfacts upon which a judgment imposing a fine upon the defendant can properly be \nentered, in that it does not allege that the steamship Tean came to the Islands \nfrom a foreign port; or that she had any quantity of opium aboard; or that any \ngoods on board were omitted from the manifest; or the amount and value of the \nmanifested goods, by relation to which the penalty could be imposed under the \nlaw; or that the omission from the manifest occurred with intent to defraud the \nrevenues. Counsel contends that the recital contained in the fourth subdivision \nof the petition to the effect that certain facts were determined at a hearing \nheld at the customhouse is not an allegation of the truth of those facts, and \nthat his admission of the truth of the allegations that these facts were \ndetermined at the hearing is by no means an admission of the truth or \ncorrectness of the findings as to these facts made at the hearing.<\/p>\n<p>Without entering on a critical examination of the petition to ascertain \nwhether all of appellant's contentions could be sustained under a literal \nconstruction of its recitation of facts, we agree with him that the petition \ncontains no allegation as to the amount or value of the unmanifested opium which \nwas found on the <em>Tean,<\/em> and that, since the fine prescribed by the \nstatute for having on board unmanifested opium must be fixed by relation to its \namount and value (sec. 303 of Act No. 355), the petition does not set forth \nfacts which, if proven, would be sufficient to sustain a judgment imposing a \nfine for a violation of the statute.<\/p>\n<p>As to the amount and value of the opium the petition merely alleges that the \nCollector of Customs, in the course of proceedings duly authorized by law, found \nas a fact in his decision that some two hundred tins of unmanifested opium \nvalued at $528 had been found on the vessel. It is very clear that the admission \nby the defendant of the truth of this allegation is by no means an admission of \nthe truth of the finding by the Collector as to the amount and value of the \nunmanifested opium.<\/p>\n<p>The Solicitor-General contends, however, that the recital in the petition \nthat the Collector of Customs had conducted proceedings in accordance with law, \nin the course of which facts were determined which, if true, would justify the \nso called administrative fine imposed by him, is a sufficient allegation of fact \nto sustain the judgment of the Court of First Instance. In support of this \ncontention, counsel rely on the following excerpt from the opinion of the trial \ncourt, which was quoted at length in our opinion in the case of the Insular \nGovernment <em>vs<\/em>. Ling Su Fan (15 Phil. Rep., 58):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Nothing contained in the said laws authorizes the Court of First Instance to \nhold a new trial, or to admit new evidence in connection with the facts \ndetermined and decided upon by the Collector of Customs, in order to render \njudgment in view of the result thereof, and by the provision in section 313 that \nthe judgment of the court in such proceedings shall be limited to one against \nthe property seized, it must be clearly understood that it is not the duty of \nthe court to make any declaration of rights in the matter submitted to it, but \nmerely to decide with regard to the confiscation or forfeiture ordered by the \nCollector of Customs, either affirming or reversing it in view of the procedure \nfollowed before the Collector.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But an examination of our opinion in that case clearly discloses that we did \nnot quote with approval the above-cited excerpt from the opinion of the trial \ncourt as asserted by counsel in his brief in this case. On thew contrary, it \nwill be found that we wholly disregarded it, and in ruling on an assignment of \nerror alleging that the findings of fact were not supported by the evidence, we \nreviewed the evidence which was submitted to the trial court, and sustained the \nfindings of the trial court by reference to that evidence, and not merely by \nreference to the findings of the Collector.<\/p>\n<p>The pertinent provisions of the statute touching proceedings of this nature, \nas found in section 5 of Act No. 864, amended by Act No. 1405, are as \nfollows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In cases appealed from the collectors of customs other than the Collector of \nCustoms for the Philippine Islands at Manila, and in cases arising at Manila, if \nno compromise is effected with the Collector of Customs for the Philippine \nIslands, then and in that case it shall be the duty of the Collector of Customs \nfor the Philippine Islands forthwith, on receiving notice from the person or \nagent whose property has been seized that he will not consent to a compromise, \nto fUe a record of all the proceedings in the Court of Customs Appeals, with a \npetition reciting the facts, asking the judgment of the court upon the issue of \nfine or penalty or confiscation or forfeiture, and praying, upon judgment, for a \npublic sale of the seized property after due advertisement to satisfy the \njudgment. Process shall issue against the owner or agent in possession of the \nproperty, and the pleadings and procedure shall be, as in other cases, in the \nCourt of Customs Appeals, of a summary character regulated by orders of the \ncourt. The sale, if ordered, shall take place in the district of seizure after \nfour weeks' posting of notice thereof at the door of the office of the collector \nof customs of the district and the publication once a week for four weeks of \nnotice in any newspaper of general circulation in the district of seizure, if \nany, and also after publication, in the discretion of the court, of 'the same \nnumber of notices in a newspaper of general circulation in Manila. The judgment \nof the court in such proceedings shall be limited to one in rem against the \nproperty seized.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We \"think that these provisions clearly contemplate a trial in the Court of \nFirst Instance, wherein judgment is rendered upon the facts as set forth in the \npetition and disclosed by the evidence adduced at the trial. Section 288 of Act \nNo. 355 as amended by section 3 of Act No. 1405 provides that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The evidence taken before either the collector of customs or the Collector \nof Customs for the Philippine Islands, may, if competent, be used before said \nCourt of First Instance for the city of Manila, and said court may receive \nfurther evidence pertinent to the issue * * * <\/p>\n<p>\"The court shall have the power to determine all questions arising in the \nappeal * * *.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It seems very clear that the facts on which the judgment of the Court of \nFirst Instance must be based are not the facts as found by the Collector, but \nthe facts as disclosed by the evidence thus submitted to the court. In the \nlanguage of the statute, the proceedings had by the Collector of Customs have \nfor their object the ascertainment of the amount of \"the fine or penalty which \nin his judgment ought to be imposed,\" and which he may accept by way of \ncompromise, if the interested party desires to pay it. We do not think that the \nlegislator intended that the conclusions arrived at by the Collector of Customs \nshould constitute a final and conclusive adjudication of the liability of the \naccused person or of his property to the fines, penalties, forfeitures, or \nconfiscations prescribed by the statute. If such had been the intention of the \nlegislator, it would seem that the judgment when rendered by the Collector would \nhave been given a more binding effect than that of a mere \"compromise\" which the \naccused person might accept or decline at his pleasure; and it would seem, \nfurthermore, that it would have been wholly unnecessary to provide a vain and \nuseless formality in the form of a trial in the Court of First Instance, wherein \njudgment is prayed upon \"the issue of fine or penalty or confiscation or \nforfeiture,\" although the real issue is limited to the question whether the \nCollector of Customs did or did not, in the course of the prescribed \nproceedings, declare that in his judgment a certain fine should be imposed or \ncertain property forfeited or confiscated.<\/p>\n<p>There seems to be some question as to the precise meaning and effect of the \n\"stipulation made in writing by the parties and filed with the court.\" Defendant \nprayed for \"judgment on the pleadings,\" admitting the truth of all the \nallegations of the petition; and plaintiff consented to \"a determination of the \naction\" upon \"the pleadings and the records submitted to the court.\"<\/p>\n<p>So far as it appears from the bill of exceptions \"the pleadings and the \nrecords\"\u2014and the only pleadings and records-\u2014submitted to the court at the time \nof the filing of the stipulation were the petition of the plaintiff and the \nexhibits thereto attached, consisting of the decision of the Collector, copies \nof the notices of the various steps in the proceedings had before the Collector, \nand affidavits regarding service of notice and of the decision of the \nCollector.<\/p>\n<p>It is very clear, therefore, that the only issue before the court when the \ncase was submitted for judgment was the defendant's prayer for judgment on the \npetition, he admitting the truth of every allegation contained therein. But such \na prayer for judgment was in effect no more than a demurrer to the petition, and \nin this jurisdiction, in the event of a judgment in favor of the defendant, or, \nin other words, in the event the demurrer is sustained, a reasonable time must \nbe allowed for the amendment o| the petition.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for defendant seems to think that by substituting a formal prayer for \n\"judgment on the pleadings\" together with an admission of the truth of the \nallegations of the complaint or petition, for the filing of a demurrer, he can \ndeprive the plaintiff of his right to amend in the event that the complaint or \npetition be held to be defective. But the right to amend under such \ncircumstances is secured to the plaintiff by the express provisions of section \n110 of the Code of Civil Procedure in ordinary actions, and we think that his \nright so to do should be respected in all cases.<\/p>\n<p>Under the practice in this jurisdiction, which has its origin in express \nstatutory provisions, a judgment on the pleadings is never properly entered in \nany case wherein a demurrer might have be,en interposed instead of a technical \nprayer for such judgment. A judgment on the pleadings is a form of judgment \nwhich has come into use in practice under the reformed codes of procedure; hence \nit is never properly entered unless clearly authorized by the statute. \nManifestly, where the statute provides for the filing of a demurrer under \ncertain conditions and prescribes the procedure to be followed when judgment is \nrendered thereon, there is no statutory authority for the filing of a technical \nmotion for a judgment on the pleadings, instead of a demurrer, and the entry of \na judgment which would deny the opposing party the right of amendment secured to \nhim by the statute.<\/p>\n<p>The proceedings in cases of this kind being conducted without regard to the \nusual formalities prescribed in ordinary actions, we think that although the \nmotion of defendant was for a judgment on the pleadings, nevertheless, as stated \nby counsel for defendant in his brief, \"the question presented is exactly that \nwhich would be raised by demurrer,\" and the motion will be disposed of as though \nit were in fact a demurrer to the petition.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the court below should be reversed and the record returned to \nthe court below, where judgment will be entered dismissing the petition unless \nplaintiff within five days from the receipt of notice that the record has been \nreceived in the court below, amends his petition by setting forth sufficient \nfacts to constitute a cause of action. So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The court erred in finding that the defendant was responsible for and \nguilty of the alleged libel.<\/p>\n<p>\"Second. The court erred in finding that the defendant was the proprietor and \npublisher of the 'Manila Daily Bulletin.<\/p>\n<p>\"Third. The court erred in finding that the alleged Jibelous article was \nlibelous per se.<\/p>\n<p>\"Fourth. The court erred in holding that the article was libelous, while \nfinding that there was no malice. <\/p>\n<p>\"Fifth. The court erred in finding that the alleged libel, ous article \nreferred to attorney Ramon Sotelo.<\/p>\n<p>\"Sixth. The court erred in finding that Ramon Sotelo was attorney for the \nplaintiffs in case No. 10191, when the alleged libel was \npublished.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>After a careful examination of the record and the arguments presented by the \nappellant, we deem it necessary to discuss only the first and second assignments \nof error.<\/p>\n<p>In the Philippine Islands there exist no crimes such as are known in the \nUnited States and England as common law crimes. No act constitutes a crime here \nunless it is made so by law. Libel is made a crime here by Act No. 277 of the \nUnited States Philippine Commission. Said Act<br\/>(No. 277) not only defines the \ncrime of libel and prescribes the particular conditions necessary to constitute \nit, but it also names the persons who may be guilty of such crime. In the \npresent case the complaint alleges that the defendant was, at the time of the \npublication of said alleged article \"the acting editor, proprietor, manager, \nprinter, publisher, etc. etc. of a certain bilingual, newspaper, etc., known as \nthe 'Manila Daily Bulletin, a paper of large circulation throughout the \nPhilippine Islands, as well as in the United States and other countries.\"<\/p>\n<p>It will be noted that the complaint charges the defendant as \"the acting \neditor, proprietor, manager, printer, and publisher.\" From an examination of \nsaid Act No. 277, we find that section 6 provides that: \"Every author, editor, \nor proprietor of any book, newspaper, or serial publication is chargeable with \nthe.publication of any words contained in any part of said book or number of \neach newspaper or serial as fully as if he were the author of the same.\"<\/p>\n<p>By an examination of said article, with reference to the persons who may be \nliable for the publication of a libel in a newspaper, we find that it only \nprovides for the punishment of \"the author, editor, or proprietor.\" It would \nfollow, therefore, that unless the proof shows that the defendant in the present \ncase is the \"author, editor, or proprietor\" of the newspaper in which the libel \nwas published, he can not be held liable.<\/p>\n<p>In the present case the Solicitor-General in his brief said that\u2014\"No person \nis represented to be either the 'author, editor, or proprietor.'\" That statement \nof the Solicitor-General is fully sustained by the record. There is not a word \nof proof in the record showing: that the defendant was either the \"atithor, the \neditor, or the proprietor.\" The proof shows that the defendant was the \n\"manager.\" He must, therefore, be acquitted of the crime charged against him, \nunless it is shown by the proof that he, as \"manager\" of the newspaper, was in \nsome way directly responsible for the writing, editing, or publishing of the \nmatter contained in said alleged libelous article. The prosecution presented the \nnewspaper, the \"Manila Daily Bulletin,\" for the purpose of showing the relation \nwhich the defendant had to it. That was the only proof presented by the \nprosecution to show the relation which the defendant had to the publication of \nthe libel in question. From an examination of the editorial page of said \nexhibit, we find that it shows that the \"Manila Daily Bulletin\" is owned by the \n\"Bulletin Publishing Company,\" and that the defendant was its manager. There is \nnot a word of proof in the record which shows what relation the manager had to \nthe publication of said newspaper. We might, by a series of presumptions and \nassumptions, conclude that the manager of a newspaper has some direct \nresponsibility with its publication; We believe, however, that such presumptions \nand assumptions, in the absence of a single letter of proof relating thereto, \nwould be unwarranted and unjustified. The prosecuting attorney had an \nopportunity to present proof upon that question. Either because he had no proof \nor because no such proof was obtainable, he presented none. It certainly is not \na difficult matter to ascertain who is the real person responsible for the \npublication of a newspaper which is published daily and has a wide circulation \nin a particular community. No question was asked the defendant concerning his \nparticular relation to the publication of the newspaper in question. We do not \ndesire to be understood in our conclusions here as holding that the \"manager\" or \nthe \"printer\" may not, under certain conditions and proper proof, be held to be \nthe \"author, editor, or proprietor\" of a newspaper. He may denominate himself as \n\"manager' or \"printer\" simply, and be at the same time the \"author, editor; or \nproprietor\" of the newspaper. He can not avoid responsibility by using some \nother term or\u201d word, indicating his relation to the newspaper or the \npublication, when, as a matter of fact, he is the \"author, the editor, or the \nproprietor\" of the same. His real relation to the said publication is a matter \nof proof. The Solicitor-General, in his brief, says that the defendant used the \nword \"manager\" with the hope of evading legal responsibility, as the Libel Law \nplaces the responsibility for publishing a libel, on \"every author, editor, or \nproprietor of any book, etc.\" Had the prosecuting attorney in the trial of the \ncause believed that the defendant, even though he called himself the \"manager\" \nwas, in fact, the \"author, editor, or proprietor\" of said publication, he should \nhave presented some proof supporting that contention. Neither do we desire to be \nunderstood as holding that simply because a person connected with the \npublication of a newspaper who calls himself the \"manager\" or \"printer\" may not, \nin fact and at the same time, be the \"author, editor, or proprietor.\" The \n\"author, editor, or proprietor\" can not avoid responsibility for the writing and \npublication of a libelous article, by simply calling himself the \"manager\" or \nthe \"printer\" of a newspaper. That, however, is a question of proof. The burden \nis upon the prosecution to show that the defendant is, by whatever name he may \ncall himself, in truth and in fact, the \"author, editor, or proprietor\" of a \nnewspaper. The courts cannot assume, in the absence of proof, that one who \ncalled himself \"manager\" was in fact the \"author, editor, or proprietor.\" We \nmight assume, perhaps, that the \"manager\" of a newspaper plays an important part \nin the publication of the same by virtue of the general signification of the \nword \"manager,\" Men can not, however, be sentenced upon the basis of a mere \nassumption. There must be some proof. The word \"manage\" has been defined by \nWebster to mean \"to have under control and direction; to conduct; to guide; to \nadminister; to treat; to handle.\" Webster defines \"manager\" to be \"one who \nmanages; a conductor or director; as, the manager of a theater.\" A manager, as \nthat word is generally understood, we do not believe includes the idea of \nownership. Generally speaking it means one who is representing another as an \nagent. That being true, his powers and duties and obligations are generally \ndefined by contract. He may have expressed as well as implied powers, but \nwhatever his powers and duties are they must be dependent upon the nature of the \nbusiness and the terms of his contract. There is no fixed rule which indicates \nparticularly and definitely his duties, powers and obligations. An examination \ninto the character of the business and the contract of his employment must be \nmade for the purpose of ascertaining definitely wliat his duties and obligations \nare. His exact relation is always a matter of proof. It is incumbent upon the \nprosecution in a case like the present, to show that whatever title, name or \ndesignation the defendant may bear, he was, in fact, the \"author, the editor, or \nthe proprietor\" of the newspaper. If he was in fact the \"author, editor, or \nproprietor,\" he can not escape responsibility by calling himself the \"manager\" \nor \"printer.\" It is the relation which he bears to the publication and not the \nname or title which he has assumed, which is important in an investigation. He \ncan not wear the toga of author or editor and hide his responsibility by giving \nhimself some other name. While the terms \"author, editor, and proprietor\" of a \nnewspaper are terms well defined, the particular words \"author, editor, or \nproprietor\" are not material or important, further thati that they are words \nwhich are intended to show the relation of the responsible party to the \npublication. That relation may as well exist under some other name or \ndenomination.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, therefore, there being no proof whatever in the \nrecord showing that the defendant was the \"author, the editor, or the \nproprietor\" of the newspaper in question, the sentence of the lower court must \nbe reversed, the complaint dismissed and the defendant discharged from the \ncustody of the law, with costs de officio. So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Moreland, Trent,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> \nconcur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

Kyburz, with intent to defraud the public and the said firm of \nGreilsammer Hermanos, owner of the above described trade-mark, did then and \nthere unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously use the word Meridian on cards \nplaced on and in connection with his watches, for the purpose of selling the \nsame as genuine Meridian watches, at his place of business, the said Manila \nJewelry Store and with the intention of making the purchasers believe that the \nsaid watches thus offered for sale and sold by the said J. Kyburz were genuine \nMeridian watches when in truth and in fact they were watches of some other make, \nto the damage and prejudice of the aforesaid Greilsammer Hermanos. All contrary \nto law.\"<\/p>\n<p>Greilsammer Hermanos is a regularly organized partnership engaged in the \nretail jewelry business in Manila. Since the year 1903 it has imported from a \nmanufacturing firm in Europe a certain class of watches upon which after due \ninspection it engraves a trademark consisting of a sphere across which runs a \nscroll bearing the word Meridian. The watches thus inspected and marked have \nbeen advertised and put on sale in this country for several years under the \ntrade name of Meridian watches. The trademark above described was duly \nregistered on or about December, 1908.<\/p>\n<p>In the month of September, 1913, Kyburz, the defendant in this case, was the \nowner of two retail jewelry stores in Manila, located within about two minutes' \nwalk of each other. He spent most of his time in one of them known as El Zenith \nthe other, known as the Manila Jewelry Store, being in charge of a manager. The \ndefendant admitted that he visited the Manila Jewelry Store several times a \nweek, and it would appear to have been at all times under his supervision and \ncontrol.<\/p>\n<p>During the month of September, 1913, a number of watches were displayed in a \nprominent place in one of the show windows of the Manila Jewelry Store under a \nshow card or placard (Exhibits B and C) which reads as follows:<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">MERIDIAN<br\/>Ten jewels. 20 years guaranty.<br\/>At P13.50. Before \nP16.50.<\/p>\n<p>It appears that the watches thus put on sale in the defendant's jewelry store \nwere purchased from the same manufacturer in Europe from whom Greilsammer \nHermanos purchased the watches upon which they engraved their trade-mark and \nwhich they sold under the trade name of Meridian watches. It would appear \nfurthermore that these watches are substantially identical in quality and \ndesign, and apparently are shipped by the manufacturer from one and the same \nstock.<\/p>\n<p>The witness Wolfson purchased one of these watches from a clerk employed in \nthe Manila Jewelry Store, who issued to him a written guaranty in which this \nwatch was described as a Meridian <em>sin marca<\/em> (unmarked). This guaranty \nbore the signature of both the clerk who issued it and the defendant, the owner \nof the store. It would appear, however, that defendant signed the guaranty in \nblank, leaving it to be filled out by the clerk at the time of the sale.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant testifying in his own behalf, swore that the clerk was not \ninstructed or authorized to set forth in the guaranty that these watches were \nMeridian watches. The clerk himself, who testified that he was not a watchmaker \nbut that he had been working for the defendant for about four months, said that \nhe first discovered the identity of the Meridian watches with those sold by the \ndefendant upon an occasion when a customer called for a Meridian watch, upon \nwhich occasion he made a comparison of the two watches and satisfied himself \nthat they were of the same make in every respect. Upon cross-examination, he was \nunable to describe the Meridian mark, and his testimony to the effect that he \nhimself made the discovery as to the identity of origin of these watches does \nnot impress us favorably, and was not accepted as true by the court below. Both \nthe manager of the branch store and the defendant himself admitted that they \nwere aware of the identity in origin of the two watches, and the defendant went \nso far as to say that when prospective purchasers asked him for a meridian watch \nhe informed them that he had the same watch but without the mark Meridian.<\/p>\n<p>The first contention of counsel for appellant is that the trial court erred \nin holding Kyburz criminally responsible for the acts of his employees in the \nManila Jewelry Store in offering for sale and in selling watches under the trade \nname of Meridian watches. It is urged that the trial court erred in holding that \nKyburz directed or authorized the action of his employees in the Manila Jewelry \nStore, in view of the positive denials of that fact by both Kyburz and the clerk \nwho made the sale above mentioned. After a careful review of the whole record we \nfind nothing which would justify us in holding that the trial court erred in \nrefusing to believe the testimony of these interested witnesses, and upon the \nwhole record we do not think that we would be justified in disturbing the \nfinding of the trial judge that the offer to sell and the sale of watches under \nthe trade name of Meridian watches were made with the knowledge and consent, if \nnot by the express direction of the defendant.<\/p>\n<p>While it is true that in cases of this kind the master cannot be held \ncriminally responsible for the acts of his employees unless they are done by his \ndirection or with his consent, nevertheless, there can be no question that he is \namenable to the criminal law when he assents, either expressly or impliedly, to \nthe commission of the act, whether he is present or not.<\/p>\n<p>The doctrine, supported by authority, is set forth as follows in 7 Labatt's \nMaster and Servant, section 2566:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"So the master is criminally responsible if he causes the illegal act to be \ndone, or requests, commands, or permits it, or in any manner authorizes it, or \naids and abets the servant in its- commission. He cannot, without rendering \nhimself amenable to the criminal law, participate in the offense, or have \nknowledge of it, or exercise any control over it, or in any manner assent to it, \nwhether he is present at the time the unlawful act is committed or \nnot.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It is contended on various grounds that the trial court erred in holding that \nthe facts as found by him constituted a violation of the provisions of section 6 \nof Act No. 666. Counsel insists that since defendant did not place the \ntrade-mark or trade name on the watches sold by him, he cannot be held liable \nfor an infringement of the penal provisions of section 6 of the Act, which \nprescribe that \"any person who, with intent to defraud the public or the owner \nof a trade-mark or trade name, shall use the trade-mark of another on his goods \noffered for sale, .* * * . shall be punished by a fine of not exceeding two \nthousand five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or \nboth, in the discretion of the court. * * *\"<\/p>\n<p>But this contention is manifestly untenable in view of the fact that the \npenal provisions of the statute are extended also in express terms to one who \nuses the \"trade name of another in his business, occupation, or profession.\" \nIndeed one of the distinguishing characteristic's of a trade name is that, \nunlike trade-marks, they are not necessarily attached or affixed to the goods of \nthe owner.<\/p>\n<p>Section 5 of the Act provides that: \"A trade name is the name, device, or \nmark by which is intended to be distinguished from that of others the business, \nprofession, trade, or occupation in which one may be engaged and in which goods \nare manufactured or sold to the public, work is done for the public, or \nprofessional services are rendered to the public. It is not essential that the \ntrade name should appear on the goods manufactured or dealt in by the person \nowning or using the same. It is sufficient if the trade name is used by way of \nadvertisements, signs over the place of business, upon letter heads, and in \nother ways to furnish to the public a method of distinguishing the business, \ntrade, or occupation of the person owning and using such name. Property in trade \nnames shall be as fully protected as property in a trade-mark by the civil \nremedies provided in section three of this Act for the protection of property in \ntrademarks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Trade names have been frequently confused with trademarks, and, broadly \nconsidered, they do include names which may constitute trade-marks.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"More accurately, however, trade names are names which are used in trade to \ndesignate a particular business of certain individuals considered somewhat as an \nentity, or the place at which a business is located, or of a class of goods, but \nwhich are not technical trade-marks either because not applied or affixed to \ngoods sent into the market, or because not capable of exclusive appropriation by \nanyone as trade-marks. Such trade names may, or may not, be exclusive. Exclusive \ntrade names are protected very much upon the same principles as trade-marks, and \nthe same rules that govern trade-marks are applied in determining what may be an \nexclusive trade name.\" (38 Cyc, 764, and cases there cited.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It is further contended that the evidence does not disclose a violation of \nthe penal provisions of section 6 of the Act because it does not appear that the \npublic was in fact deceived as to the quality of the watches purchased from the \ndefendant, the watches sold by the defendant and the complaining company having \nbeen made by the same manufacturer, and being in fact of exactly the dame \nstandard and quality. It is to be observed, however, that the statute penalizes \nthe use of trade-marks and trade names with intent to defraud <em>either<\/em> \nthe public or the owner of such trade-mark or trade name.<\/p>\n<p>Trade names are protected against use or imitation upon the ground of unfair \ncompetition, and an examination of the statute clearly indicates its purpose to \nprotect the manufacturer or dealer as well as the public.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The rule which protects against unfair competition is primarily for the \nprotection of the party against whom such competition is directed, and only \nincidentally for the protection of the public. In some of the cases language is \nused which would suggest that the public is under the protection of the court, \nbut in fact the liability of the article to mislead the public is only an \nelement of proof in the plaintiff's case, the evidence showing that he has been \nor may be injured by the fraudulent acts of the defendant. The court, therefore, \ndoes not interfere for the purpose of preventing the public from being misled, \nexcept in so far as it is necessary to protect the owner of a business from its \nfraudulent invasion by others. If what is done tends to mislead the public, it \nnaturally diverts customers from the complainant, to the injury of his business. \nThe prohibition is upon so acting as to beguile the public, and thus mislead an \nintending purchaser into buying the goods of one person under the belief that he \nis buying those of a rival.\" (Paul on Trademarks, sec. 215.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The same author in section 209 says that \"the law of unfair competition rests \nupon the simple principle that no person has the right to sell his own goods as \nthose of another. In other words, the basic rule is that no one shall, by \nimitation or any unfair device, induce the public to believe that the goods he \noffers for sale are the goods of another, and thereby appropriate to himself the \nvalue of the reputation which the other has acquired for his own products or \nmerchandise.\"<\/p>\n<p>We think that the following citation from the opinion of the Supreme Court of \nthe United States in the case of Menendez <em>vs.<\/em> Holt (128 U. S., 514), \nwritten by Chief Justice Fuller, quite clearly indicates the grounds upon which \nthe decision of the court below must be sustained: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The fact that Holt &amp; Co. were not the actual manufacturers of the flour \nupon which they had for years placed the brand in question does not deprive them \nof the right to be protected in the use of that brand as a trade-mark.<\/p>\n<p>\"They used the words La Favorita to designate flour selected by them, in the \nexercise of their best judgment as equal to a certain standard. The brand did \nnot indicate by whom the flour was manufactured, but it did indicate the origin \nof its selection and classification. It was equivalent to the signature of Holt \n&amp; Co. to a certificate that the flour was the genuine article which had been \ndetermined by them to possess a certain degree of excellence. It did not, of \ncourse, in itself indicate quality, for it was merely a fancy name and in a \nforeign language, but it evidenced that the skill, knowledge, and judgment of \nHolt &amp; Co. had been exercised in ascertaining that the particular flour so \nmarked was possessed of a merit rendered definite by their examination and of a \nuniformity rendered certain by their selection.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Greilsammer Hermanos import watches of a certain make and standard, stamp \nthem with their trade-mark, put them on the market under the trade name of \nMeridian watches, and have advertised them and established a market for them. By \nso doing they give the public to understand that watches known in Manila as \nMeridian watches are of a certain make, standard, and quality, guaranteed by \nthem. A sale of a Meridian watch by them carries with it the guaranty that in \ntheir best judgment it is equal to the standard thus established. They do not \nclaim to be the manufacturers of these watches, but every sale by them of a \nwatch under the trade name thus adopted and advertised implies that their skill \nand judgment, as watchmakers and jewellers, has been exercised in ascertaining \nthat this watch is up to the standard established for watches known as Meridian \nwatches.<\/p>\n<p>Trade names are acquired by adoption and user, and belong to the one Who \nfirst uses them and gives them value. (Viano vs. Baccigalupo, 183 Mass., 160; \nChadron Opera House Co. <em>vs.<\/em> Loomer, 71 Neb., 785; Liebig's Extract of \nMeat Co. <em>vs.<\/em> Liebig Extract Co., 172 Fed., 158.) We think that there \ncan be no doubt that Greifsammer Hermanos have acquired the exclusive ownership \nof the trade name Meridian as applied to this class of watches, and that they \nare clearly entitled to protection from the use of this trade name by others, \nnot only under the express provisions of section 6 of the Act, but also upon the \ngeneral grounds which afford protection against unfair competition.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, nothing that has been said should be construed as a holding that \nGreilsammer Hermanos have an exclusive right to sell watches of the make or \nstandard of those on which they engrave their trade-mark, and which are \nthereafter sold by them under the trade name of Meridian watches. There is \nnothing in the record which would indicate that, by contract with the \nmanufacturer or otherwise, they have acquired any such exclusive right in and to \nthis make of watches or in and to their sale. We hold only that no person is \nentitled in these Islands to sell watches, whether of the same make and quality \nas those of the defendant or of any other make and quality, under the trade name \nof Meridian watches, which by adoption and user has become the property of \nGreilsammer Hermanos. With the infinity of distinguishing names, marks and signs \nwhich are subject to the use and appropriation of makers and dealers in watches, \nthe use of the trade name Meridian by any other firm than Greilsammer Hermanos \ncan have but one reasonable explanation, and that is the intent to take \nadvantage of the favorable opinion formed by the public of the quality and \nstandard of the watches sold by that firm under the trade name adopted by it for \nadvertising purposes, and as a guaranty to the public that such watches have \npassed through its hands and are up to the standard set by it for watches \nadvertised and sold as Meridian watches.<\/p>\n<p>We find no error in the proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the accused. \nThe judgment entered in the court below should therefore be affirmed, with the \ncosts of this instance against the appellant.

FRANCISCO PIO DE RODA, MARIANO PIO DE RODA, AND MARIANO MANALO, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">It appears from the record that some time before the commencement of the \npresent action, the defendant, Francisco Pio de Roda, commenced an action in the \nCourt of First Instance of the Province of Cavite, against Abdon Ambat and \nIsabel Bebe, for the purpose of recovering a sum of money due from the \ndefendants to the plaintiff. Said action was known as cause No. 396. In said \naction a judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the \ndefendants. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court, where the judgment of \nthe lower court was affirmed, and the cause was remanded to the lower court for \nexecution.\n<p>On the 4th day of April, 1911, an execution was issued upon said judgment and \nthe property of Abdon Ambat and Isabel Bebe was attached. The plaintiff now \nclaims that said execution included a portion or parcel of land particularly \ndescribed in paragraph 3 of the present complaint, which belonged to him. The \nplaintiff alleges that he gave the sheriff notice of the fact that said parcel \nof land so attached belonged to him. Said notice was given in writing.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff also gave a bond to the sheriff, in order to have the \nattachment released upon said property. Notwithstanding said notice and said \nbond, the sheriff, in the month of December, 1911, sold the said parcel of land \nto the said Francisco Pio de Roda and Mariano Pio de Roda.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants allege as a defense that said parcel of land, at the time of \nsaid attachment, actually belonged to Abdon Ambat and Isabel Bebe, and did not \nbelong to the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>Upon the issue thus presented, the lower court found that the preponderance \nof the evidence showed that the plaintiff was the owner of the land attached, \nand declared null and void the said sale and ordered the defendants to return \nthe possession of said property to the plaintiff and also entered judgment \nagainst Francisco Pio de Roda and Mariano Pio de Roda, jointly and severally, \nfor the sum of P160, for the use and occupation of said land, and to pay the \ncosts. From that judgment the defendants appealed to this court. In this court \nthe appellant alleges that the lower court committed the following errors:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"1. The lower court erred in finding that Abdon Ambat and Isabel Bebe never \nhad any right, interest or share in the land in question.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. The lower court erred in finding that the appellee was proven to have \nbeen in possession of the land in question, peacefully, as the owner thereof, \nfor a period of more than 30 years prior to the attachment, and in not holding \nthat the said possession only dated from the year 1906 in which the appellants \nsought to bring an action against the spouses Ambat and Bebe, and that the said \npossession was simulated and was for the purpose of defrauding the \nappellants.<\/p>\n<p>\"3. The lower court erred in decreeing that the sale of the land in dispute \nby the sheriff to the appellants at public auction was null and void.<\/p>\n<p>\"4. The lower court erred in ordering the appellants to pay to the appellee \nthe sum of P160 as damages. <\/p>\n<p>\"5. Finally, the lower court erred in not absolving the appellants from the \ncomplaint, in not raising the preliminary attachment issued in this action, and \nin not ordering the appellee to pay to the appellants the sum of P80 as damages \nand the costs of the suit.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The first and second assignments of error may be discussed together, inasmuch \nas they each relate to the ownership of the land in question. The lower court \nfound that the plaintiff was the owner of said parcel of land; that the \nplaintiff had been in possession of the same for a period of thirty years and \nthat he had inherited the same from his parents. An examination of the record \nbrought to this court, in our opinion shows by a large preponderance of the \nevidence, that that finding of the lower court is fully sustained.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the third assignment of error the facts show that the clerk \nof the Court of First Instance of the Province of Cavite issued the said writ of \nexecution on the 4th day of April, 1911; that the said writ ordered the sheriff \nto attach the specific property involved in this litigation; that the sheriff \nattached said property on the 7th day of June, 1911; that the property under \nsaid attachment was sold on the 28th day of December, 1911.<\/p>\n<p>Section 445 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides: \"The \nexecution may be made returnable at any time not less than ten nor more than \nsixty days after its receipt by the governor or his deputy, to the clerk of the \ncourt rendering the judgment.\"<\/p>\n<p>The lower court held that, inasmuch as the attachment was not made until \nafter the expiration of the sixty days within which the writ should have been \nreturned, the attachment was null and void. Said provisions were copied, almost \nword for word, from section 683 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the State of \nCalifornia. Said section (445) fixes the life of the writ of execution. The \nsheriff had no authority to make any attachments after the return day of said \nwrit. If he had been unable to attach the property during the lifetime of the \nwrit, it should have been returned and an alias writ issued. It was the duty of \nthe sheriff to return the writ within the time fixed by law. It is the duty of \nan officer to whom a writ of execution is issued, to make return thereon on or \nbefore the time fixed by law, to the proper court or officer, whether it has \nbeen executed or not. (Clingman vs. Barrett, 6 Humphs. (Tenh.), 20; Billgery vs. \nFerguson, 30 La. An., 84.)<\/p>\n<p>The attachment may be made at any time up to and including the very last day \nof the writ, but can not be made thereafter, without the issuance of an alias \nwrit. After the property has been attached legally, within the lifetime of the \nwrit, the property may be held by the sheriff and sold thereafter. The sale by \nthe sheriff under a valid attachment after the return day of the execution, is \nvalid, provided that the attachment was made during the lifetime of the writ. \n(Freeman on Executions, section 160; Southern California Lumber Co. vs. Ocean \nBeach Hotel Co., 94 Cal., 217; 28 Am. St. Rep., 115.)<\/p>\n<p>It would appear from the record that at the time the attachment was made, the \nlife of the writ under which it was made had expired. The sheriff had no \nauthority to make an attachment after the expiration of 60 days from the \nissuance of said writ. The sheriff should have secured an alias writ of \nattachment. We do not decide, however, at the present time, that the sale should \nbe set aside for the reasons indicated. We find, however, that the record \ncontains another reason which is sufficient to justify the setting aside of the \nsale and ordering the property returned to the plaintiff. That reason is that \nthe property did not belong to the judgment debtors at the time of the sale, but \nto the plaintiff. The sheriff was without authority to sell the land of the \nplaintiff to pay the debts of another. For that reason the sale was illegal and \nvoid and the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of his property.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the fourth assignment of error, the defendants allege that \nthey are possessors, in good faith, by virtue of the public sale made by the \nsheriff and should therefore be relieved from the payment of any sum whatever \nfor the use and occupation of the property in question.<\/p>\n<p>The record shows that the parcel of land in question had been attached at the \nspecial instance and request of the defendants ; that even after the plaintiff \nhad notified the sheriff in writing that the land belonged to him, and had \nfurnished a bond to the sheriff for the purpose of having said judgment \ndischarged, the defendants insisted upon the sale of the same. The defendants \nhad ample notice that the property was claimed by the plaintiff. Yet, \nnotwithstanding that fact, they insisted upon the sale under said execution. \nUnder these circumstances, we do not believe that they can be considered as \npossessors in good faith.<\/p>\n<p>Having in view the foregoing conclusions, with reference to each of the \nassignments of error, we find no justification for reversing or modifying the \ndecision of the lower court upon the statements made by the appellant in the \nfifth assignment of error.<\/p>\n<p>After a careful examination of the record, with reference to the specific \nassignments of error, we find no good reason for modifying the judgment of the \nlower court. The same is therefore hereby affirmed, with costs. So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

This \nlevy was on the entire store and business of appellant, the same, as a result \nthereof, being entirely closed.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Claim was immediately made to the sheriff in Tacloban by appellant for the \nstore and goods, and, upon Artadi &amp; Co. refusing to file an indemnity bond, \nthe attached goods and premises were restored to appellant in the latter part of \nMarch, 1905.<\/p>\n<p>\"It should be noted here that this delivery back to appellant was because of \nhis sworn representations and claim of ownership of the property.<\/p>\n<p>\"After the return of his goods and the reopening of his store, appellant \ncontinued his business, when, on the 22d of February, 1906, the store was once \nagain attached and closed up by virtue of an order of execution in the same case \nas before. This levy was made by the same deputy sheriff, the municipal \npresident of Liloan, and Antonio Eiguran and Carlos de Lizardi, managers of \nArtadi &amp; Co.

In that \naction the plaintiff company, in February, 1905, obtained an attachment before \ntrial upon the property of the defendants, consisting of a stock of goods in a \n<em>tienda,<\/em> or a part thereof, supposedly the property of the defendants, \nwhich is, generally speaking, the subject matter of this action. On the 21st of \nMarch, 1905, another attachment was made in the same action and on the same, or \nsubstantially the same, property.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants Jose Garrido and Fernando Garrido desiring to recover \npossession of the property attached, on the 10th of April, 1905, made an \napplication to the court in which the action was pending and which had issued \nthe orders of attachment, to have them dissolved and the property returned to \nthe owners, presenting the proper petition, affidavits, and undertaking to that \nend. On the 14th of April, 1905, the court ordered a dissolution of the \nattachments and the return of the property to Jose and Fernando Garrido.<\/p>\n<p>On the 27th of May there was issued by the deputy sheriff, who had in his \npossession the property attached in February and March, 1905, a paper signed by \nhimself and by the plaintiff in this action, Chua Doc De, entitled \"In the Court \nof First Instance of Leyte, Artady and Company <em>versus<\/em> Jose Garrido and \nFernando Garrido\" and denominated \"Right of third party to ownership and \npossession presented by the Chinaman Chua Ducly, <em>alias<\/em> Dia.\"<\/p>\n<p>This paper reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In the municipality of Liloan, May 27, 1905.<\/p>\n<p>\"Mr. Gervasio D.

Under this execution the sheriff on February 24, 1906, levied upon and \nseized substantially the same stock of goods and business which had been seized \nunder the attachments of February and March, 1905.<\/p>\n<p>In April, 1906, one Tim Ymco (alias Yma) presented to the sheriff who made \nthe levy under the execution of December 2, 1905, issued against Jose Garrido \nand Fernando Garrido, a sworn statement alleging that the true and lawful owner \nof the property seized under that execution was a partnership composed of \nChinese persons, namely, himself and one Chua Doc De (alias Dia) doing business \nunder the firm style and name of \"Quimzungzing.\"<\/p>\n<p>From this statement of the case, as it appears from the documentary evidence \nin the record, it is clear that the first two seizures and not the first one \nalone were attachments. <\/p>\n<p>That of March 22, 1905, was not a levy \"by virtue of a writ of execution\" as \nstated by the plaintiff, but was an attachment levied in the same action and for \nthe same purpose as that of February 18 of the same year. No levy could have \nbeen made under an execution at that time because a judgment was not obtained in \nthe action against Jose Garrido and Fernando Garrido until the 2d of November, \n1905, and no execution was issued thereon until December 19 of the same year. \nThe first levy under an execution was made on the 6th of February, 1906.<\/p>\n<p>It should be noted also that it is very doubtful if the delivery of the \nproperty thus attached to the appellant was \"because of his sworn \nrepresentations and claim of ownership of the property\" as claimed by the \nplaintiff. It should be remembered that both attachments were made in the same \naction, and upon parts of the same stock of goods and business. According to the \ndocumentary evidence in the case, as we have seen, the defendants in that action \nmade an application to the court after the second attachment had been made for a \nrelease of the property from said attachments and the return thereof to them, \nthey alleging that said property belonged to them and was in their possession at \nthe time of the attachment. They offered a bond for the safe custody of the \nproperty pending the determination of the action. It is to be assumed that the \nplaintiff was notified of this application, and it would seem that, if Chua Doc \nDe and Tim Ymco were the owners of the property, they themselves would have \nknown of the seizure under the two attachments referred to and would have \nappeared in the action for the purpose of obtaining release of the two \nattachments upon the ground that the property belonged to them or to the firm of \nwhich they claimed to be partners. No such appearance, however, was made and the \ncourt issued an order dissolving the attachments and ordering the return of the \nproperty to Jose and Fernando Garrido. It should be noted that the order of the \ncourt dissolving the attachments required the giving of <em>two<\/em> bonds, one \nof P35,000 and the other of P17,500. The order is a typewritten order and was \noriginally drawn so as to require the giving of <em>one bond only<\/em> and that \nfor P35,000. After it had been typewritten, however, and at the time of the \ngranting of the order of the 14th of April, 1905, the court, or someone for it, \ninterlined with pen and ink just after the words \"a bond in the sum of 35,000 \npesos,\" these words: \"and another for the sum of 17,500 pesos.\" This would \nindicate that the order was drawn after the first attachment and before the \nsecond, and, accordingly, provided for the giving of only one bond and that in \nthe amount necessary for the dissolution of the first attachment; that, after \nthe drawing of the order and before it was granted, the other attachment was \nmade, and the order, when granted, providing for the dissolution of both \nattachments, must, as a consequence, provide for the corresponding bond for \neach.<\/p>\n<p>The important thing is that the property seized under both attachments was \nordered, after a hearing before the court, delivered back into the possession of \nJose arid Fernando Garrido as their property.<\/p>\n<p>About the time that this was occurring, we find in the record a paper issued \nby the deputy sheriff who had made the attachments, setting out, as will be seen \nfrom the contents of the document hereinbefore quoted, that one Chua Ducly had \nlaid claim to the ownership of the property thus attached and recites that \n\"since the Court of First Instance of this province has ordered the dissolution \nof the attachment levied on the property of the defendants Jose Garrido and \nFernando Garrido, I have deemed it proper to return and deliver to the third \nparty, the Chinaman Chua Ducly (<em>alias<\/em> Dia), under his own \nresponsibility, the merchandise which was taken from him on the 18th of February \nand the 21st of March last, as hereinbefore related.\"<\/p>\n<p>Why property should be returned by the sheriff to Chua Ducly when the court \nhad dissolved the two attachments thereon upon the ground that the property \nbelonged to Jose and Fernando Garrido it is impossible to say, except upon the \ntheory that Chua Duc was either an agent of the Garridos or was connected with \nthem in business; and the consent of the Garridos to such delivery can be based \nonly on some such assumption.<\/p>\n<p>It is, therefore, important to note that the claim on the part of plaintiff \nand appellant that the delivery of the property \"back to the appellant (Chua Doc \nDe) was because of his sworn representations and claim of ownership of the \nproperty\" is not altogether borne out by the documentary evidence of the case. \nThe property was delivered as much by reason of the dissolution of the \nattachments, and perhaps much more, as by the resolution of the claim of \nownership by Chua Doc De. .In other words, the documentary evidence in the case \nseems to show that the property in question belonged to the Garridos rather than \nto the plaintiff in this case. This is still more evident when we observe that, \nwhen the levy was made under the execution issued against Jose and Fernando \nGarrido by Artadi &amp; Co. and the same property already twice attached was \nseized and levied upon, a claim of ownership was put forward not by Chua Doc De \nwho, it is claimed, had presented a claim of ownership when the property was \nattached and who is claiming exclusive ownership in this case, but by a \npartnership having the firm style and name of \"Quimzungzing.\" This claim was put \nforward by one Tim Ymco, alleging that he and Chua Doc De were partners in the \nfirm just mentioned. This levy, it must be remembered, was upon the same \nproperty upon which the attachments had been made previously and it is the \nproperty or substantially the property which was released from the attachments \nby order of the court upon the Garridos giving two bonds conditioned that they \nwould take and safely keep the property delivered to them by virtue thereof, so \nthat, in the event that Artadi &amp; Co. obtained a judgment against them, it \nwould then be subject to levy and sale under execution in favor of said \ncompany.<\/p>\n<p>This claim on the part of the partnership mentioned having been made and \nArtadi &amp; Co. not having given the bond required by section 451 of the Code \nof Civil Procedure, no sale of the property was made under the execution and the \nlevy appears to have been abandoned. There is nothing in the record that shows \nwhen this occurred. We know that it was made in February, 1906, and that the \nclaim was presented by the firm of \"Quimzungzing\" on the 3d of March \nfollowing.<\/p>\n<p>While the plaintiff testified that he was the owner of the goods, wares, and \nmerchandise in question and that no other person had any interest therein, we \nhave seen that that fact is disputed by the documentary evidence in the case and \nso seriously that we are left much in doubt as to the good faith and validity of \nplaintiff's pretensions in. that regard. It is incumbent upon the plaintiff to \nprove his ownership, if he recover at all, by a fair preponderance of the \nevidence. Whether the evidence of a plaintiff preponderates or not depends not \nonly upon the testimony itself, but upon the character and credibility of the \nwitnesses presented to prove it. In this litigation three different persons or \nentities have claimed ownership of the property in question: Jose and Fernando \nGarrido, Chua Doc De (the plaintiff in this case), and the partnership of \n\"Quimzungzing.\" The Garridos claimed the property and presented two undertakings \nconditioned in large amounts for the dissolution of two attachments and the \nreturn of said property to them. In that proceeding the judge found that they \nwere entitled to possession of the property and, after the undertakings were \nfiled, ordered it returned to them. About the same time an act of the sheriff, \nfound in the record in the form of a receiptand delivery, seems to indicate that \nthe plaintiff in this case had put in a claim as owner of the property attached \nand that the sheriff, in delivering the property, delivered it to him. In that \nreceipt, however, are also mentioned the attachments levied against the Garridos \nand their dissolution by the court and the order to return the property attached \nto them. Later in the record we found the property being claimed by the firm of \n\"Quimzungzing,\" represented by Tim Ymco, one of the alleged partners thereof, he \nasserting that he and the plaintiff in this case constituted the firm. This \nlatter claim of ownership was admitted by the plaintiff in this case and the \nfirm appears to have obtained a release of the property in its favor some time \nin April or May, 1906.<\/p>\n<p>In this action, however, and as early as June, 1906, when the complaint was \nfiled, we find the plaintiff claiming to be the sole owner of the property, \nwithout alleging how it ceased to be the property of Jose and Fernando Garrido \nor how it ceased to be the property of the firm of \"Quimzungzing.\"<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that upon the whole case the plaintiff has not \nestablished his ownership of the property in such a manner as to warrant his \nrecovery in this case. If plaintiff has done anything at all in that regard, it \nis to demonstrate that Tim Ymco (<em>alias<\/em> Yma) has an equal interest with \nhim in the property. There can be no question that if the plaintiff has \nestablished any ownership of the property outside of the Garridos, it is a joint \nownership between him and his partner. He recognized this clearly toward the \nclose of the case and asked that the summons and complaint be amended so as to \ninclude Tim Ymco as a party plaintiff in the case. This amendment was opposed by \nthe defendant upon the ground that it brought a new factor into the case which \nhad not been there before and would require, in substance, a relitigation of the \nwhole matter. The court took the matter under advisement, but, so far as the \nrecord shows, never ordered the amendment prayed for. As a necessary result \nthere exists a defect of party plaintiff which is fatal to Chua Doc De's \nrecovery in this action.<\/p>\n<p>We do not think the evidence warrants the conclusion which appellant draws \ntherefrom, namely, that defendant by its agents, servants, or employees took \nsufficient part in the attachments and levy to make the defendant company \nresponsible either in trespass or for malicious interference with plaintiff's \nproperty. When a plaintiff places his execution in the hands of an officer for \nservice, he is presumed to intend that no action shall be taken thereunder not \nauthorized by the terms of the writ. The sheriff may seize the property of a \nstranger or do any other unauthorized act without thereby creating any liability \nagainst the plaintiff, because the plaintiff is not presumed to have directed or \nratified the illegal proceeding. While this presumption may be rebutted and the \ninjured party may show in such rebuttal that the plaintiff was a cotrespasser \nwith the officer or that he ratified the trespass and thus make him responsible \nfor the abuse of the writ, that has not been done in this case by a fair \npreponderance of the evidence.<\/p>\n<p>It not having been shown that the defendant company was a cotrespasser with \nthe officer or that it ratified the acts of the sheriff in making the \nattachments and the levy, the charge that it maliciously caused the attachments \nand levy to be made upon the property of the plaintiff falls.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

FELIPE LASTIMOSA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARAULLO, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The defendant was sentenced by a judgment of the Court of First Instance of \nLeyte, dated June 11, 1913, as guilty of the crime of murder, to the penalty of \ntwenty years of <em>cadena temporal,<\/em> to indemnify the family of the \ndeceased Lucas Prieto in the sum of P500, and to pay the costs. Appealing from \nsaid judgment, he alleges in his defense in this instance that the trial court \nerred in weighing the evidence submitted by the prosecution, as well as in not \nfinding as a result of such evidence a very grave and reasonable doubt in his \nfavor and in not declaring him to be entitled to the benefits of the amnesty \nproclaimed by the President of the United States on July 4, 1902.\n<p>The deed with which Felipe Lastimosa. was charged in the complaint, is that \nhe did willfully, unlawfully and and criminally, with deliberate premeditation \nand assisted by a certain Pedro and one Isco, treacherously inflict death upon \nLucas Prieto one day in the month of February, 1901, in the municipality of \nBaybay, Province of Leyte, in these Islands, by slashing said Prieto in the \nabdomen with a bolo and cutting his throat, while he was bound and held by the \nsaid Pedro and Isco.<\/p>\n<p>According to the testimony of Demetria Prieto, daughter of the deceased, her \nfather was inside their house in the mountains of Baybay when the men named \nPedro and Isco bound him up by order of Iping Lastimosa, that is, the defendant \nFelipe Lastimosa. Upon seeing this she fled in fear and did not afterwards see \nher father. She added that her mother at that time also ordered her to run away, \nbecause her father had been caught by Iping, who falsely attributed to him the \ntheft of a carabao of his. Finally, since that date, she had not again seen \nPedro, or Isco, or the defendant, nor had she returned to her home; and her \nmother, now deceased, had told her in her aunt's house the morning after the \ncrime that Felipe was the one who had killed her father.<\/p>\n<p>Hilario Laguna, a neighbor of Lucas Prieto's, whose house was about 10 brazas \nfrom his, testified that on that occasion he saw Prieto and Felipe engaged in a \ndispute, and when he casually left his house he saw four persons, the deceased, \nthe defendant Iping, Pedro, and Isco, also leaving Prieto's house; the latter's \ntwo hands were tied with a rope which was held by Pedro, who was behind him, the \nother two being on each side, that is, Isco on his left and the defendant Felipe \non his right. The latter struck Prieto a blow with his bolo on the right side of \nthe neck, so that only a very small portion of his head was left attached to his \nbody and he died immediately after the blow. The witness then took to flight and \ndid not again see Felipe Lastimosa and his companions, because they fled from \nthe place. This witness added that the occurrence took place at 7 o'clock in the \nevening; that there was a light in the deceased's house which illuminated that \nspot; that he was at a distance of 7 brazas from them; and finally, that he had \npreviously known the accused and his two companions. He had been informed by the \nwife of the deceased that the cause of the occurrence was that her husband was \ncharged with the theft of a carabao.<\/p>\n<p>According to another neighbor of the deceased, one Mateo Montajes, whose \nhouse was opposite at a distance of 10 brazas, the wife of the deceased had run \nto it about 7 o'clock in the evening of the day in question begging him to help \nher husband because he was being killed. He went toward the place of the \noccurrence, concealing himself about 3 brazas from the place where the defendant \nFelipe Lastimosa and his companions Pedro and Isco, whom he had known \npreviously, were; he saw them going away and Lucas Prieto dead, with his neck \nalmost completely cut through and a very small portion of his head attached to \nhis body. The corpse was picked up by the deceased's own brothers about 10 \no'clock the next morning. When asked if he had testified before the justice of \nthe peace that Lucas' corpse bore two wounds, one in the abdomen and the other \nin the neck, this same witness replied that blood showed on the body but that he \nhad not ascertained whether there was a wound or not.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the defendant himself, in testifying as a witness in his own behalf, \nstated that Lucas Prieto had stolen a carabao from him; that he went to his \nhouse to ask him if he had stolen it, and Prieto had replied in the affirmative, \nadding: \"You and all the strangers here and your master are marked to be \nkilled.\" He decided to go to the town hall of Baybay to report the theft to the \nrevolutionary leader called Capili, because the revolution was then in full \nswing, and having done so, Capili gave him an order, saying: \"All right, you go \nback to the place, accompanied by these two whom I send with you, to get the \ncarabao and if he does not deliver it to you, kill him.\" He then went back to \nLucas Prieto's house, accompanied by two insurgents who belonged to Capili's \nband, one of them called Isco, all three being armed with bolos.<\/p>\n<p>When they reached the house and called up a greeting from below, Lucas came \ndown carrying a reaping hook and immediately asked them: \"Who are you?\" When his \ntwo companions replied, \"We've come to get the carabao,\" Lucas said, \"Yes, you \ncan get the carabao, but choose between your lives and the carabao.\" His \ncompanions then retreated, because it appeared that Lucas' intention was to kill \nthem, and as he observed that a quarrel was arising between the two who had \naccompanied him and Lucas, who was the one that began the attack, he retreated a \ndistance of about 3 brazas; he did not know which of his two companions it was \nthat slashed Lucas, who was not then bound. He added that there was a light in \nthe house but that it did not illuminate the place where they were, and finally \nthat he saw there the corpse of Lucas, which had only a single wound in the \nneck. <\/p>\n<p>As appears from the evidence taken at the trial, the defendant has \ncorroborated the story of the prosecution's witnesses with reference to the fact \nthat Lucas Prieto was violently killed on the occasion they speak of, and for \nthe motive assigned by some of them, although by hearsay from the wife of the \ndeceased. The defendant himself has also explicitly acknowledged that he was the \nperson directly interested in the matter that furnished the motive for the \ncrime, which was the recovery of the carabao that, according to him, Lucas \nPrieto had stolen from him; and that it was he to whom Capili gave the order to \ngo to the place, accompanied by the two insurgents or revolutionists, in order \nto recover the carabao or kill Prieto if he did not deliver the animal to them. \nOn the other hand, it is unlikely that Prieto would have dared to threaten and \nattack the defendant and his two companions, the three of them being armed as \nthey were with bolos, when they appeared at his house to demand of him the \nreturn of the carabao. If to all this be added the consideration that there is \nno proof nor a single circumstance in the case which would indicate that either \nthe daughter of the deceased or the other two witnesses took any special \ninterest in incriminating the defendant, for the former confined herself to \ntelling solely what she had seen, when she might also have said, without fear \nthat any one would contradict her, that she saw the defendant himself wound her \nfather with the bolo; and the other two witnesses told what, under the \ncircumstances, each one of them could have seen, the conclusion is reached that \nit is proven beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the defendant who killed \nLucas Prieto with the bolo he carried, while the victim had his hands tied with \na cord held by one of defendant's companions and he was watched by the other, \nthe three having bound the deceased inside his own house before taking him \ndownstairs under the same house, where they accomplished his death.<\/p>\n<p>The accused, then, is criminally responsible therefor as a principal, and \nwould be responsible as such although he had not materially committed the crime \nhimself. For it was proven that he took a direct part in its execution and \ncooperated therein by acts without which it could not have been accomplished. In \nthe first place he went to lay his complaint against Lucas Prieto before the \nrevolutionary leader Capili; from him he secured the order to go with his \ncompanions to either recover the carabao or kill Prieto; with his comrades he \nrepaired to Lucas Prieto's house to carry out the order and lastly, he witnessed \nthe execution of that part of the order that related to the killing of Prieto, \nalways supposing that it was not he himself who carried it out but one of his \nsaid two companions. He did not prevent it, as he might well have done, seeing \nthat the order was issued by Capili for defendant's benefit. On the contrary, he \nrequired compliance with the order, for no other meaning could be attached to \nhis presence in the act, interested as he was in securing the recovery of the \ncarabao from decedent whom he accused of stealing the beast.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Persons who are present during the commission of a crime and lend their \nmoral support thereto without actively participating therein are nevertheless \nguilty as principals.\" (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Ancheta, 1 Phil. Rep., 165.)<\/p>\n<p>\"One who shares the guilty purpose and encourages and abets the crime by his \npresence at the time of its perpetration is guilty as principal even though he \nmay have taken no part in its material execution.\" (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Santos, 2 \nPhil. Rep., 453.)<\/p>\n<p>\"In order to warrant a conviction as principal in the crime of murder, it is \nnot necessary that the defendants should have taken an active and material part \nin its commission, but such conviction will also be sustained if it appears that \nthe defendant did willingly stay with those who took a material part and was \nvoluntarily present from the time the crime was commenced until it wag \nconsummated.\" (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Balisacan, 4 Phil. Rep., 545.) \n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It having been conclusively proven that the deceased had his hands tied when \nhe was mortally wounded in the neck, by which means the perpetrators of the \ncrime especially and directly assured the consummation of their purpose with out \nany risk to their own persons that could proceed from any defense he might put \nup, the crime committed by the defendant must be classified as murder, under \narticle 403 of the Penal Code, by reason of the concurrence of the qualifying \ncircumstance of treachery, and there must be imposed upon him the penalty set \nforth in said article for that crime.<\/p>\n<p>He cannot be considered as entitled to the benefits of the amnesty granted on \nJuly 4, 1902, because the crime in question was not perpetrated for political \nreasons or as a consequence of hatreds, feuds, or dissensions of a political \ncharacter between the deceased and the defendant or between the former and the \nrevolutionary leader Capili, it having been merely a means of personal revenge \nput into execution by the defendant against the deceased on the supposition that \nthe latter had stolen an animal belonging to him.<\/p>\n<p>The trial court has not, therefore, in the judgment appealed from, incurred \nany of the errors assigned by the defense in its brief. In the commission of \nsaid crime there Has concurred the generic aggravating circumstance that the \ndeed was executed in the dwelling of the offended party without provocation on \nthe part of the victim, for the defendant and his companions bound him inside \nhis own house and later took him in that manner to a place near by, where the \ncrime was consummated, a fact which cannot hinder the holding of said \ncircumstance, because, as the supreme court of Spain has declared in a decision \nof October 9, 1875, the act performed cannot, for the purposes of such holding, \nbe divided or its unity be broken up, when the offender began the aggression in \nthe dwelling of the offended party and ended it in the street or outside of said \ndwelling. Nevertheless, the defendant must be given the benefit of the \nprovisions of article 11 of the Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 2142. This \nextenuating circumstance will offset the generic aggravating one set forth \nabove, wherefore the penalty fixed for the crime ought to be imposed in its \nmedium degree.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, we sentence the defendant to the penalty of life imprisonment \n(<em>cadena perpetua<\/em>), with the accessories of article 54 of the said Code, \nto such extent modifying the judgment appealed from with reference to the \npersonal penalty imposed therein upon him, and affirming it in other respects \nwith the addition that he shall not suffer subsidiary imprisonment for \ninsolvency of the indemnity, in view of the nature of the principal penalty; \nwith the costs of both instances against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

We have held in the case of United \nStates vs. Mariano (27 Phil.

In other words, the sentence should specifically \nshow whether the defendant was sentenced to <em>presidio correccional<\/em> or \n<em>presidio mayor<\/em> or <em>arresto mayor<\/em> and in what degree. A sentence \nfor one year and one day is not a complete sentence according to the practice of \nthe courts. It should be one year and one day of <em>presidio correccional<\/em> \nand should state whether it is the minimum, medium, or maximum degree \nthereof.<\/p>\n<p>The Solicitor-General found himself in the difficulty to which we have just \nreferred when he attempted to sustain the judgment and sentence of the trial \ncourt. He says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Having in mind the penalty imposed by the lower court upon the defendant and \nappellant, 'one year and one day of imprisonment, a fine of P160 or subsidiary \nimprisonment in case of insolvency, payment of the costs, and disqualification \nfor a period of six years and one day under article 385 of the Penal Code, and \nconfiscation of the carabao in accordance with article 389 of the same code,' it \nseems that the court convicted the accused under article 382 of the Penal \nCode.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This discloses the manner in which the Solicitor-General, as well as this \ncourt, has arrived at the article of the Penal Code on which the conviction is \nfounded.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the accused was also uncertain as to the article under which the \naccused was convicted, He says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The judgment appears to be based on articles 381 or 382 of the Penal \nCode.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the accused should have been convicted under \narticle 382 of the Penal Code, which provides that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Any public officer who shall agree to commit any act of injustice not \nconstituting a crime in connection with the exercise of the powers of his \noffice, in consideration of any offer or promise or of any gift or present \nreceived by such officer, personally or through the mediation of another, shall, \nif the act of injustice be committed, suffer the penalty of <em>presidio \ncorreccional<\/em> in its medium and minimum degrees and pay a fine of not less \nthan the value of the gift and not more than three times such value; if the act \nof injustice shall not have been committed, a penalty ranging from arresto mayor \nin its maximum degree to presidio correccional in its minimum degree and a fine \nof not less than the value of the gift and not more than double such value shall \nbe imposed.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It certainly is an act of injustice to convict a person charged with a crime \nwithout regard to what the evidence in the case may be. The accused promised \nPascua to convict Pagulayan regardless of the evidence in the case and \napparently carried out his promise. In consideration thereof he was to receive \nand did receive a carabao worth P80. It is an act of injustice for a judicial \nofficer to decide a case pending before him regardless of what the evidence may \nshow. (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Alban, 4 Phil. Rep., 363.)<\/p>\n<p>The act of injustice having been committed, the defendant should have been \npunished with <em>presidio correccional<\/em> in its medium and minimum degrees \nand sentenced to pay a fine of not less than the value of the gift and not more \nthan three times its value. The gift itself should also have been confiscated, \nunder article 389 of the Penal Code.<\/p>\n<p>The case does not fall within article 381 of the Penal Code for the reason \nthat, in order to be within that article, the act which the accused agrees to \ncommit must be criminal. The act with he agreed to perform in the case before us \nwas to convict the accused* This was not a criminal act. Nor does the act fall \nwithin the provisions of article 347 of the Penal Code, which provides that \"any \njudge who shall knowingly render an unjust decision against the defendant, \netc.,\" shall be punished as therein provided. We do not know whether the \ndecision was a just one or an unjust one. There is nothing in the record to \ndetermine that fact. We may say, therefore, without determining what effect, if \nany, the decision \"of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of \nAlzua <em>vs.<\/em> Johnson (231 U. S., 106) has upon the provisions of Chapter I \nof Title VII of the Penal Code, that there is no evidence upon which we may \ndetermine that the judgment to be rendered was an unjust judgment.<\/p>\n<p>There appearing in the case neither aggravating nor extenuating \ncircumstances, the penalty should be, imposed in the medium degree. The court \nshould have imposed a penalty of one year eight months and twenty-one days of \n<em>prision correccional,<\/em> a fine of P 160, confiscation of the carabao, the \ncosts of the trial, and eight years and one day of temporary special \ndisqualification.<\/p>\n<p>As so amended, the judgment is affirmed, with costs against the \nappellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

This defendant, \nhowever, was positively identified by the complaining witness, who recognized \nboth his face and his voice. Immediately after the band left his house, he made \ncomplaint to the <em>concejal<\/em> of his barrio, and named the appellant as one \nof the band, saying that although this accused and one other stayed below while \nthree of the party went up into the house, he recognized him as he passed \nthrough a ray of light from the lamp upstairs, and by the sound of his voice. \nThe wife of the complaining witness also positively identified appellant by the \nsound of his voice downstairs. Appellant was also fully identified as one of the \nband by the boatman who brought them from the <em>tienda<\/em> of appellant to a \npoint not far from the place where the crime was committed. It is not quite \nclear whether or not this witness was himself one of the band of robbers, or \nwhether he was merely employed by the band to bring them to the scene of the \ncrime. But however this may be, his testimony corroborating and corroborated by \nthe positive testimony of the victims of the robbery, leaves no room for doubt \nas to the identity of this appellant as one of the band of armed robbers who \ncommitted the crime. <\/p>\n<p>Much is made by counsel as to the possibility of mistake on the part of the \nwitnesses in undertaking to identify appellant by the sound of his voice. But as \nwe have said, there is other conclusive testimony of his identity in the record, \nand the identification by the sound of his voice is merely corroborative of that \nevidence.<\/p>\n<p>A motion for a new trial was made in this court, based on several vague, \nindefinite and unsatisfactory affidavits in which affiants express their belief \nthat appellant did not leave his barrio on the night of the robbery. There is \nnothing in these affidavits which would justify us in believing that the \nintroduction of the testimony of these witnesses on a new trial would put in \ndoubt the positive, definite and convincing testimony now in the record as to \nthe identity of this appellant. There is no ground therefore for the allowance \nof a new trial. <\/p>\n<p>The judgment entered in the court below convicting and sentencing this \nappellant should therefore be affirmed, with the costs of this instance against \nhim.

THE MUNICIPALITY OF BALIUAG, PROVINCE OF BULACAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an action to quiet title to two parcels of land situated in the \npoblacion of the municipality of Baliuag, Province of Bulacan. The admitted \nfacts in this case are that these lots were occupied by a school and municipal \nbuilding, respectively, belonging to the municipal government from very early \ntimes. In 1895 the central government claimed the land and ordered its sale at \npublic auction. This sale occurred July 8,1895. The plaintiff's bid of P300 was \naccepted. Title was accordingly issued to him and the sale was registered the \nfollowing year\u20141896. Notwithstanding this public sale, the municipality \ncontinued to occupy the lots and to collect the rents from several tenants whose \ndwellings were located thereon. In fact, it appears that its possession of the \nland had been undisturbed by anyone except the central government (in 1895) \nuntil the institution of this action in 1908. In other words, the plaintiff has \nnever made any pretense to rely upon his documents of title between the date of \nhis purchase in 1895 and shortly before he instituted the present action in \n1908.\n<p>The plaintiff testified that he had lost his documents of title in the \nrevolution of 1898 and did not recover them until the month of April, 1908. \nDuring this period of time he had merely tolerated the possession of the \nmunicipality as he had no proof sufficient to establish his title. The documents \nof title had been returned to him by his attorney. His attorney testified that \nthe documents had been given to him by a third person whose name he refused to \nreveal and that, the plaintiff being a friend of his, he had taken them to \nhim.<\/p>\n<p>The municipality introduced the deposition of Father Prada, now residing in \nSpain, who was the parish priest of the municipality from 1889 to 1898, when he \nwas compelled to leave on account of the revolution. The affiant declared that \nwhen the Insular Government claimed the land and proceeded to advertise it for \nsale, a number of the principal people had an unofficial conference with him at \nwhich they requested him to furnish the money with which to buy the land in \norder that it might be retained by the municipality, with the understanding that \nthe latter would repay him at a future date. He agreed to do this and chose the \nplaintiff to appear at the auction and bid for the property, furnishing him the \nmoney. According to the affiant, it was in this capacity that the plaintiff \npurchased the land at the public auction, with the affiant's money. Upon \nreceiving the documents of title, the plaintiff turned them over to the affiant, \nwho kept them in his office continuously until 1898, when he was obliged to \nleave the municipality and did not take them with him.<\/p>\n<p>A number of reputable citizens of the municipality who had been raised in the \nmunicipality and had held offices in the local government, both before and after \nAmerican occupation, testified that the plaintiff represented either the \nmunicipality or Father Prada at the sale, although they did not exactly agree as \nto which of these two furnished the money. As justly remarked by counsel for the \ndefendant, however, this is a question which it is unnecessary to investigate in \nthis action, as either theory is sufficient to defeat the plaintiff's claim of \npurchase in his own behalf. A number of tenants of this land also testified that \nthey had always paid rent to the municipality and never to the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>It was also shown that the plaintiff was an officer of the local government \nin various capacities at different times since 1896, and that he had subscribed \nto official acts of the municipal council in which the municipality's claim of \nownership of the land was clearly set forth. The municipal market was built in \n1895 and witnesses for the defense testified without contradiction that the \nmaterial in the former municipal building was used in its construction. It is \nfurther admitted that the municipality collected the rents from these parcels \nfrom 1895 until 1898, when plaintiff claims to have lost his documents of title. \nTo assume that this alleged loss was a sufficient excuse for his acquiescing in \nthe acts of ownership performed by the municipality between the years 1898 and \n1908, when he first disputed the possession of the municipality, would be a most \ncharitable view of the plaintiff's case. But he offers no explanation of his \nacquiescence in the possession of the municipality between 1895 and 1898, during \nwhich time he must have had possession of his documents of title by his own \ntestimony. On this point also, he is directly contradicted by Father Prada, who \ntestified that he it was who had possession of these documents during this \nperiod.<\/p>\n<p>It seems unnecessary to enter into an extended discussion of the evidence of \nrecord. The facts testified to by the witnesses for the defendant are so clearly \nestablished as to leave no doubt whatever of their authenticity, and the only \nquestion is whether they ought to be admitted to vary the terms of the \nplaintiff's deed.<\/p>\n<p>There have been a number of cases before this court in which a title to real \nproperty was acquired by a person in his own name while acting in a fiduciary \ncapacity, and who afterwards sought to take advantage of the confidence reposed \nin him by claiming the ownership of the property for himself. This court has \ninvariably held such evidence competent as between the fiduciary and the cestui \nque trust.<\/p>\n<p>In Uy Aloe <em>vs.<\/em> Cho Jan Ling (19 Phil. Rep., 202), the members of a \nChinese club agreed to purchase some real property and for that purpose \nsubscribed a fund and placed it in the hands of the defendant, who made the \npurchase in his own name. Subsequently, he refused, to account for the rents on \nthe property and claimed it as his own. This court held parol proof of the trust \nsufficient to overcome the case in favor of the defendant by reason of his \nregistered documents of title, and decreed that a conveyance be made<br\/>by the \ndefendant to the members of the association.<\/p>\n<p>In Taguinot vs. Municipality of Tanay (9 Phil. Rep., 396), the plaintiffs, as \nheirs of their father, sought to recover possession of a parcel of land held by \nthe municipality on the strength of a Spanish patent issued to him. It was \nproved (largely by parol evidence) that their father acted on behalf and at the \nexpense of the municipality in securing the patent. 'The patent was retained by \nthe gobernadorcillo, a copy only being issued to the patentee. The latter also \ndrew up a private document engaging to execute a conveyance to the municipality, \nthe same being offered in evidence. The municipality had continuously occupied \nthe land since the issuance of the title. The judgment of the court below \ndismissing the complaint was affirmed.<\/p>\n<p>In the following cases of a similar character, parol evidence was held not \nsufficient to overcome the case made out by the holder of the registered title: \nBelen <em>vs.<\/em> Belen (13 Phil. Rep., 202); Garen <em>vs.<\/em> Pilar (17 \nPhil. Rep., 132); Balatian <em>vs.<\/em> Agra (17 Phil. Rep., 501). Agonoy \n<em>vs.<\/em> Ruiz (11 Phil. Rep., 204), and Madariaga <em>vs.<\/em> Castro (20 \nPhil Rep., 563), were both cases wherein one person was delegated by a community \nof property owners to secure in his own name a patent from the Spanish \nGovernment covering all their lands, the object being to save the expense of \nobtaining individual patents in the name of each. After securing these patents, \nthe therein grantees ejected their neighbors from the land covered by the \npatents and respectively claimed the land as their own. The evidence tending to \nestablish these facts was considered by the court in both cases. Relief by \nreformation of the patent or a compulsory conveyance to the injured persons was \ndenied in each case, because the rights of an innocent third purchaser \nintervened. But in the first case the injured persons were held' entitled to \ndamages, provided they were able to establish the same. In the second case, \nhowever, the court presumed a waiver of their claims by reason of other evidence \nof record. The fact that the parol evidence relied upon in the cases cited in \nthis paragraph to defeat the documents of title was carefully considered by the \ncourt, impliedly admits its competency. It failed in its purpose in these cases \nmerely because it was not sufficiently strong to overcome the case in favor of \nthe holders of the registered titles.<\/p>\n<p>We hold, therefore, that the parol evidence introduced by the defendant \nmunicipality was competent to defeat the terms of the plaintiff's deed. It need \nonly be added that in all such cases as the present we have required and shall \ncontinue to require that the proof contradicting such documents must be clear \nand convincing. These qualities are apparent in the proof offered by the \ndefendant municipality in the case at bar.<\/p>\n<p>What judgment ought to be entered in this case? The court below simply \nabsolved the defendant from the complaint. The defendant municipality does not \nask for a cancellation of the deed. On the contrary, the deed is relied upon to \nsupplement the oral evidence showing that the title to the land is in the \ndefendant. As we have indicated in Consunji <em>vs.<\/em> Tison (15 Phil. Rep., \n81), and Uy Aloe <em>vs.<\/em> Cho Jan Ling (19 Phil. Rep., 202), the proper \nprocedure in such a case, so long as the rights of innocent third persons have \nnot intervened, is to compel a conveyance to the rightful owner. This ought and \ncan be done under the issues raised and the proof presented in the case at \nbar.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the court below, absolving the \ndefendant from the complaint, is affirmed; and it is directed that the plaintiff \nexecute a conveyance of the property in dispute, now standing on the property \nregistry in his name, to the defendant municipality.<\/p>\n<p>It may be added that this judgment can affect no right which Father Prada may \nhave against the municipality for the recovery of the purchase money, which he \nalleges to have furnished. The costs will be against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The decision raises and discusses the question \nas to when parol evidence is admissible to vary, alter or contradict the terms \nof a written instrument. That question is not in the case in any sense and has \nno bearing whatever on the resolution of the question presented.<\/p>\n<p>As is seen from reading the decision, the only question involved is whether \nthe plaintiff bought the land from the Insular Government on his own behalf and \nwith his own money or for and on behalf of the municipality and with money of \nthe latter; in other words, whether he holds the land for and on behalf of the \nmunicipality or whether he holds it as owner. There is nothing in this question \nwhich, in the remotest way, involves that of the admissibility of parol \nevidence.<\/p>\n<p>It should be noted, in the first place, that there is no written instrument \nbetween the plaintiff and the municipality, that is, <em>between the parties to \nthe action;<\/em> and there is, therefore, no possibility of the question arising \nas to the admissibility of parol evidence to vary or contradict the terms of an \ninstrument. The written instrument, that is, the conveyance on which plaintiff \nbases his action, was between the <em>Insular Government<\/em> and the plaintiff, \nand not between the municipality and the plaintiff; and, therefore, there can \narise, as between the <em>plaintiff<\/em> and <em>defendant,<\/em> no question \nrelative to varying or contradicting the terms of a written instrument between \nthem. Thus, when the decision states that \"the facts testified to by the \nwitnesses for the defendant are so clearly established as to leave no doubt \nwhatever of their authenticity, and the only question is whether they ought to \nbe admitted to <em>vary the terms of the plaintiff's deed,\"<\/em> it is apparent, \nin my judgment, that the nature of the question presented for resolution is \nmisunderstood.<\/p>\n<p>In the second place, the evidence presented by the defendant, whether parol \nor documentary, was not offered, for the purpose of varying or contradicting the \nterms of the deed between the Insular Government and the plaintiff. Nobody seeks \nto destroy that deed or to alter, vary, or contradict its terms in any way. That \nconveyance, just as it stands, is the basis of defendant's rights in this \naction. It is admitted that that deed was made precisely as it stands and that \nits terms are exactly in accordance with the wishes of the parties who made it. \nNo one is seeking to alter, vary or contradict it. The evidence is offered for \nthe purpose of showing that the plaintiff, in taking that deed, the terms of \nwhich are absolutely undisputed, was acting as the agent of the municipality and \nthat he received that deed for and on behalf of the municipality and that he \nwill, therefore, be compelled, at the suit of the municipality, to transfer to \nit the lands described therein. In other words, the evidence was offered, not to \nvary the terms of a written instrument, but to establish what the decision calls \na trusteeship; and all relevant and material evidence, whether oral or \ndocumentary, is admissible for that purpose.<\/p>\n<p>In the light of these observations, the statement of the court that \"we hold, \ntherefore, that the parol evidence introduced by the defendant municipality was \ncompetent to destroy the terms of the plaintiff's deed,\" appears to be based on \na misunderstanding of the nature of the case and of the objects which the action \nwas intending to secure. Why attempt to vary the terms of, plaintiff's deed? \nThat is the very thing the defendant is depending on to establish the \ntrusteeship from which springs plaintiff's liability to deed the property to the \nmunicipality. The municipality is not trying to vary or contradict or destroy \nplaintiff's deed; in fact, <em>it is the purpose of the municipality to \nestablish that deed, just as it stands,<\/em> as, without the deed from the \nInsular Government to plaintiff, the municipality would be unable to prove the \ntrusteeship upon which it depends to obtain a conveyance from the plaintiff. \nMoreover, if we destroy plaintiff's deed; then a deed from plaintiff to the \nmunicipality would be defective, because the registry of property would show no \ntitle in the plaintiff which he could transfer to the municipality. The only \nreasons why the court orders a transfer from the plaintiff to the municipality \nis because the plaintiff has title, actually and according to the record, of \nland which belongs to the municipality. If he does not have that title, then a \ndeed from him to the municipality is without proper basis, there being absent a \nlink in the chain of title, and, if the court holds that the evidence in this \ncase destroys plaintiff's deed, then, at the same time, it destroys, so far as \nthe record goes, the value of a deed from him to the municipality; for, if the \nplaintiff has no title, he can confer none.<\/p>\n<p>The law, relative to parol evidence is set out in section 285 of the Code of \nCivil Procedure. That section reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing by the parties, \nit Is to be considered as containing all those terms, and therefore there can \nbe, between the parties and their representatives or successors in interest, no \nevidence of the terms of agreement other than the can* tents of the writing, \nexcept in the following cases:<\/p>\n<p>\"1. Where a mistake or imperfection of the writing, or its failure to express \nthe true intent and agreement of the parties, is put in issue by the \npleadings;<\/p>\n<p>\"2. Where the validity of the agreement is the fact in dispute. But this \nsection does not exclude other evidence of the circumstances under which the \nagreement was made, or to which it relates, or to explain an intrinsic \nambiguity, or to establish its illegality or fraud. The term 'agreement includes \ndeeds and instruments conveying real estate, and wills as well as contracts \nbetween parties.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It will be noted that the admissibility of parol evidence which affects the \nterms of a written agreement must be raised by one of the parties to that \nagreement against the other, or by his representative or successor in interest. \nIn the case before us the parties to the instrument are not the parties to the \naction, nor are their representatives or successors in interest; and, therefore, \nthe question of the admissibility of parol evidence cannot arise.<\/p>\n<p>Even if the case before us were one in which the question of the \nadmissibility of parol evidence could arise, such evidence would not be \nadmissible for the reason that it does not fail within any of the exceptions \nmentioned by the section above quoted. There was neither a mistake nor an \nimperfection in the instrument, nor did it fail to express the true intent and \nagreement of the parties; the validity of the instrument is not a fact in \ndispute; there is no ambiguity; and it is not attacked for fraud or illegality. \nThus it is seen, as already stated, that, if the question of the admissibility \nof parol evidence were a question in the case, such evidence would have to be \nrejected because the conditions required to make it admissible are not present. \nThe existence of the instrument in its present form and with all of its terms \nintact is one of the fundamental and necessary bases of defendant's right to \nobtain a transfer from the plaintiff to it; and its only hope of justifying its \ncontention is based on the existence of that instrument in its present form and \nwith its present terms unchanged by parol or other evidence. <br\/><\/p><\/div>",

M. Moir, judge, found the accused \nguilty of the crime of homicide and sentenced him to the penalty of fourteen \nyears eight months and one day of <em>reclusion temporal,<\/em> to the accessory \npenalties, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P500, without \nsubsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs. From this \njudgment the defendant appealed.\n<p>At about 4 o'clock in the morning of March 25 of the present year, Tomasa \nAlvarez left the house of Jacoba Aguilera where she was living; this house is \nsituated on a street which crosses Calle Real, Lipa, Batangas, and which passes \nin front of the church a short distance from the said house. A little while \nafterwards the defendant also left the same house, where he too was living, and \nfollowed the woman Alvarez, with whom he was maintaining amorous relations. \nJusto Siautong, another resident in the said house, saw them leave it one after \nthe other and observed them afterwards walking together in the direction of the \nchurch. However, the woman and the defendant could not have gone to the church, \nwhich was in the same street, but must have followed Calle Heal, and turned to \nthe left in the direction of the bridge, for Juan Mayo, while passing along \nCalle Real, saw them there just before he reached the bridge and at a point \nabout 50 meters distant therefrom. The defendant was holding Tomasa Alvarez \nhand, and the witness heard the woman say: \"Why do you behave so toward me?\" and \nthen noticed that the woman seemed to be crying, for her voice was hoarse and \nthe defendant was striking her. Witness at the time was about 3 meters distant \nand he recognized the couple by the light of an adjacent street lamp, but as he \nknew that they both lived in the same house and that amorous relationship \nexisted between them, he abstained from interfering and continued on his \nway.<\/p>\n<p>Simeon Abarquez, another witness who that morning must have passed along the \nsame street a few moments afterwards, positively testified that he saw Pio \nLacorte on the approach of the bridge carrying a woman on his back; that upon \nasking him what the matter was the defendant replied that his wife had fallen \nill while on her way with him to church. Witness then advised the defendant to \nlay the woman on the ground and wipe the perspiration off her, and, acting on \nthe suggestion, Lacorte propped her against the wall formed by a part of the \nbalustrade of the bridge. Witness saw that the defendant was supporting the \nwoman; that her head lolled to one side, that her face was pale and her eyes \nwere closed. As witness was in a hurry he left them there and continued on his \nway, paying no attention to what he had seen, for he believed that the woman was \nthen only sick and that she really was the defendant's wife. The evidence \nfurther shows that at about 5.30 that morning the said Justo Siautong, who had \nremained in the house, saw Pio Lacorte hastily return to it, naked, wet up to \nhis knees and covering his private parts with his hands. Dionisio Manalo, who \nwas living in the next house, testified that he saw the defendant return home \nalone just at daybreak, clad in a white shirt and white drawers and wet to his \nknees; that he did not pass through the door of the house but entered the yard \nby jumping over the low wall that inclosed it.<\/p>\n<p>Very early in the morning of the said date the corpse of Tomasa Alvarez was \ndiscovered in the bed of the Sabang River near the aforementioned bridge, and \nupon the arrival of the local authorities they found it lying face upward with \none of the arms slightly bent toward the head and the left leg curved half way \nto the body. The woman's chemise, skirt, and underskirt were raised a little and \nher hair was disheveled. She had on a <em>tapis<\/em> and skirt of black \nmaterials, a rose-colored bodice, and a kerchief fastened with a pin, while her \nskirt and chemise were turned up half way to her knees. A couple of meters away \nfrom her head a prayer-book and a pair of slippers were found and near her feet \na veil. Her body was lying in about 6 centimeters of water and all the said \narticles and the clothing of the deceased were wet.<\/p>\n<p>A post-mortem examination of the body in the house of the decedent by Dr. \nFrancisco Campo, a physician of the Bureau of Health, in the presence of Dr. \nSixto Rojas and the justice of the peace, disclosed a discoloration about the \nsize of a peseta above the nipple of the right breast, another 4 centimeters \nlong, in the region of the iliac fossa, a number of abrasions in the region of \nthe sacrum and gluteus, the upper medial part of the right thigh and on the left \nthigh, a contused wound in the region of the femoral coccyx, other contusions of \nthe size of a half-peso on the knees and elbows, and several smaller ones on the \ninner lower part of the forearms. The head, pericardium, and lungs were \napparently in a normal condition, no lesions being discovered in them. About 25 \ngrams of liquid were found in the pericardium. The heart showed nothing \nabnormal. The lungs were a little congested and the stomach was completely \nempty. In the upper part of the liver there was a rupture about 10 centimeters \nin length. The gall bladder was full of a greenish liquid and there was a large \nextravasation of blood in the transverse colon, due to the rupture of the \nspleen. The kidneys, uterus, Fallopian tubes, supra-renal capsules, and the \novaries were found to be in a normal condition.<\/p>\n<p>According to the opinion of the physician, Tomasa Alvarez' death could not \nhave been occasioned by any single one of the aforesaid injuries, but tyy all of \nthem together and through a kind of nervous shdck produced by a blow such as \nwould result from a fall or collision with some blunt instrument; that the \nrupture of the liver might have been, caused by a blow or by collision with such \ninstrument, or else by a strong convulsion, though the record does not show that \nthe deceased received any blow in the region of this organ.<br\/><br\/>Dr. Sixto \nRojas, as a witness for the defense, testified that in his opinion the rupture \nof the liver was necessarily caused by a fall; that the abrasions found on the \nbody must have been occasioned by the woman's trying, at the moment of her fall, \nto avoid striking her head against the ground;,that she suffered a traumatic \nshock in falling from a buttress of the bridge, a height of about 4 or 5 meters, \nand that had she fallen from the floor of the bridge, a distance of 19 meters, \nthe bones of her body would have been dislocated and broken. This witness added \nthat the deceased was afflicted with mental disorders and hysteria and that he \nhad rendered her medical attendance.<\/p>\n<p>From the foregoing facts, which were duly proved, it is concluded that Tomasa \nAlvarez died a violent death as the result of a nervous traumatic shock and the \nrupture of her Liver caused by maltreatment and blows inflicted with a hard, \nblunt instrument; that her liver might have been injured by a violent \nconvulsion, inasmuch as the body presented no sign whatever of any lesion or \nbruise in the region where this organ is situated.<\/p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the opinion of the physician, Doctor Rojas, who was present \nat the autopsy and afterwards testified as a witness for the defense, we find, \nafter a careful examination of the evidence, that the said Tomasa Alvarez lost \nher life as a result of the maltreatment she received in the street or on the \napproach of the bridge, and that after she died her body must have been dragged \nover the hard ground in various ways to the bed of the river, as evidenced by \nthe slight bruises and abrasi6ns running along and down the body, which the \nsanitary officer testified were found on the back, in the region of the sacrum, \non the forearms, thighs, knees, elbows, and in the region of the left iliac \nfossa. It cannot be affirmed that the woman fell from the floor or the \nbalustrade of the bridge, for the reason that, as that part of the bridge is 19 \nmeters high, and as the river bed next to the bank where the body was found, is \nof cement, had she fallen from either of these points, the autopsy would \nnecessarily have disclosed dislocations and fractures of bones, and none were \nfound at the time the post-mortem examination was made by the said physician. On \nthe other hand, the latter testified that he found no signs of the woman's \nhaving been strangled, or that she had been drowned, for there were scarcely 6 \ncentimeters of water in the river.<\/p>\n<p>Against the opinion of the physician, presented as a witness by the defense; \nthat the deceased, on account of her being afflicted during her lifetime with \nhysteria and mental disorders, must have thrown herself down from one of the \nbuttresses of the bridge and from a height of 4 or 5 meters, producing by her \nfall a rupture of the liver and the traumatic shock that occasioned her death; \nthe conclusion may be drawn from the evidence, that after the death of Tomasa \nAlvarez her slayer dragged her body from the street to the river and placed it, \nas above stated, in the bed of the stream.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant denied the charge and pleaded not guilty. He testified under \noath that he and the deceased had maintained amorous relations with each other \nand had agreed to get married; that they lived in the same house, though not \nconjugally, but that they had not determined upon the day of the marriage; that \nearly in the morning of the aforementioned date, Tomasa left the house to go to \nchurch, and, when the defendant heard the bells ring announcing the mass, he \narose, dressed, and also went to the church to hear mass; that after the service \nwas over he left the church and then met Sergio Gomez; that he walked along with \nhim until they arrived in front of a bakery, which Gomez entered, but the \ndefendant continued on his way with the intention of returning to his house; \nthat upon arrival there he changed his clothes and bathed himself on the porch, \non which occasion his drawers got wet; that, while engaged in sweeping the lower \nfloor of the house, where his silver smith's shop was located, he observed that \npeople were passing the place in great excitement and heard them say that \nsomebody had died under the bridge; that thereupon he picked up his hat and went \nthere to see the corpse; when he saw it he noticed that its dress was like the \none Tomasa Alvarez had worn and, besides, heard the people say that the dead \nwoman was the said Tomasa, called in the town Cang Asay; that he then returned \nto his house and awoke its owner, Ventura Maralit, to apprise her of what had \nhappened; that, in his haste to return home, he passed, behind the house and \njumped over the inclosing wall which was more than a meter in height; that when \nhe left the church the day was just beginning to break; that he did not see the \ndeceased inside of the church, although by her dress he supposed she was there \nat worship; and that at that time he was wearing white trousers, a white Chinese \nshirt, and a pair of slippers only, not shoes. <\/p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the defendant's denial and the statements made by him in his \ntestimony, the record shows sufficient circumstantial evidence which, when \ncarefully weighed, produces in the mind a full conviction of his guilt as the \nsole perpetrator of the crime under prosecution.<\/p>\n<p>This conclusion is based upon the following testimony: <\/p>\n<p>Justo Siautong, who lived with the defendant in the same house of Ventura \nMaralit, from one of its windows saw Pio Lacorte walking with Tomasa Alvarez in \nthe direction of the church, situated a short distance from the house on the \nsame street, but witness did not notice whether Lacorte entered the church. \nAbout an hour and a half afterwards, toward 5 o'clock in the morning of the same \ndate, the defendant returned to the house. He was wet up to his knees and had \nhis privates covered with his hands as he entered the small room where he \nchanged his clothes. Although defendant testified that he had been in the church \nto hear mass, he was unable to say whether or not Tomasa Alvarez was there and \nmerely supposed that she was, because she used to go there every day.<\/p>\n<p>That same morning, while it was yet dark, Juan Mayo saw the defendant in \nCalle Real, near the bridge, holding the deceased by the hand. Judging from her \nvoice the woman appeared to be crying and was asking the defendant why he \nbehaved in that way toward her. Witness believed that the defendant was then \nmaltreating her.<\/p>\n<p>The trial judge doubted the veracity of the testimony of this witness, Juan \nMayo, for the reason that, if it were true that he saw the defendant and the \ndeceased at a place 50 meters distant from the bridge, under the circumstances \nabove stated, instead of relating the matter to the chief of police in the \npresence of the municipal vice-president, he confined himself to asking the \nformer whether he knew anything about the death of the woman, to which the chief \nof police replied that up to then he knew nothing of it. <\/p>\n<p>Mayo's behavior does not necessarily demonstrate that he was a false witness. \nHe perhaps wanted to know from the lips of the chief of police the reason why \nthe defendant abused the deceased and very likely on this account abstained from \ntelling what he had seen several hours before.<\/p>\n<p>Simeon Abarquez also saw the defendant and the deceased early that same \nmorning near a lighted street lamp and at a distance of about 10 or 12 meters \nfrom the bridge. The defendant was then carrying the woman on his back and upon \nbeing asked what was the matter, replied that she was his wife and that she had \nfallen ill while accompanying him to church. When the defendant put the woman on \nthe ground and rested her against the balustrade of the, bridge, witness noticed \nthat her eyes were closed, her face was pale, and that her head was inclined to \none side.<\/p>\n<p>If it is true that, while the defendant and the deceased were going to \nchurch, as the witness Siautong, who saw them go out of the house and walk in \nthe direction of the church, supposed that they were going, the woman fell sick \nand the defendant thereupon had to carry her, it is strange that the witness \nSimeon Abarquez should have seen them in such a posture on the approach of the \nbridge that is a continuation of Calle Real\u2014-a place some distance away from and \nnearly opposite that where the church is situated. Besides, from the house where \nthe defendant and the deceased were living the church is not reached by way of \nCalle Real and the road to the bridge is in exactly the opposite direction from \nthat leading to the church. If it is true that the woman fell sick on the way to \nthe church and was unable on that account to proceed further, she should have \nbeen taken to her house, which was near by and situated on the same street as \nthe church. They should not have gone toward the bridge, on the approach of \nwhich they were seen, first by Juan Mayo at the time the defendant was \nmaltreating Tomasa Alvarez, and afterwards by Simeon Abarquez when the woman, \nthen in a bad condition and apparently dead, or at least exhausted and fainting, \nwas being carried by the defendant on his back. As the witness Abarquez, being \nin a hurry, left them and went on, his way it is to be presumed that after his \ndeparture the defendant must have carried the body of the woman Alvarez to the \nriver bed, a distance of almost 4 meters from the bridge.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant and the deceased together left the house in which they were \nliving and went in the direction of the church. This fact was affirmed by the \nwitness Justo Siautong and by the defendant himself. The latter, however, was \nunable to state positively whether the deceased entered the church or, if she \ndid, whether she remained in it upon his leaving to return to his house. It is \ntherefore to be presumed that the defendant's statements in this regard are not \ntrue, inasmuch as two witnesses saw him with the deceased on the approach to the \nbridge\u2014a place shown by the rough sketch presented by the prosecution to be \ndistant from and opposite that where the church is situated.<\/p>\n<p>From the defendant's testimony it is inferred that he denied having been with \nthe deceased on the approach of the bridge near which the body of the woman \nAlvarez was found. He cited as a witness Sergio Gomez, who saw him in the \ndoorway of the church. This witness, however, testified that the defendant was \nthen wearing a white coat, ash colored trousers, and shoes, contrary to the \nstatement made by the latter that early that morning he was dressed in a Chinese \nshirt, white trousers, and a pair of slippers. <\/p>\n<p>The witness Dionisio Manalo testified that early in the morning of the day \nabove mentioned he saw the defendant hurriedly return to his house; that his \ntrousers were wet up to his knees, and that in entering the house he did not \npass through the door, but jumped over the wall into the yard. <\/p>\n<p>This testimony, corroborated by Justo Siautong, contradicts that of the \ndefendant and his witness, Sergio Gomez, to the effect that Lacorte had then \ncome from the church, for he would not have returned from it hurriedly with his \ntrousers wet up to the knees\u2014a detail which the defendant endeavored to explain \nby saying that he had wet his drawers in washing himself on the porch of the \nhouse.<\/p>\n<p>The record does not show that when the deceased left the house early that \nmorning accompanied by the defendant, she was suffering from any sickness. After \nher departure she never returned to the house again and when broad daylight came \nshe was found in the bed of the river, lying in 6 centimeters of water. When the \ndefendant returned to his house at daybreak his trousers were wet up to his \nknees, indicating that he had been in the said river, yet he has not explained \nhow and in what manner Tomasa Alvarez came by her death.<\/p>\n<p>Two witnesses for the defense, Emerenciana Tolentino and Nicanor Hernandez, \nthe latter a minor 12 years of age, gave testimony tending to prove that the \ndefendant was not then at the bridge with the deceased and which to some extent \ncorroborated the opinion of Doctor Rojas that Tomasa Alvarez threw herself from \nthe bridge to the river bed, but their testimony, however, did not shake the \ndecisive and conclusive evidence introduced by the prosecution.<\/p>\n<p>The corpse was found, not in the middle of the Sabang River, but nearer to \nthe bank, lying on the cement bed of the stream where there were not more than 6 \ncentimeters of water and at a point about 4 meters below the level of the \nbridge. If the body of the deceased had fallen or had been thrown from the \nbalustrade of the bridge, it would have been found nearer to the bridge and not \n4 meters away at a spot which she could not have reached even had she jumped; \nbesides, in view of the fact that the top of the buttress of the bridge is \nbeveled, it would be rather difficult, according to trustworthy opinion, to \nclimb from the balustrade of the bridge out on to the buttress. The conclusion, \ntherefore, is logically reached that the body of the deceased must have been \ncarried and dragged along the road leading from the street to the said \nriver.<\/p>\n<p>The record discloses no motive that may have induced the defendant to deprive \nthe deceased of her life, but it does show convincing circumstantial evidence of \nhis guilt as the sole proved perpetrator of the crime in question, and in order \nto arrive at a conviction, it is not necessary and indispensable to prove the \nmotive when the guilt of the principal has been positively and conclusively \nshown.<\/p>\n<p>Nor does the record reveal the manner in which the defendant performed the \nacts which caused the death of Tomasa Alvarez, so it would not be proper to \nconsider the qualifying circumstance of treachery, and the crime is properly \nclassified as that of homicide, comprised within article 404 of the Penal Code. \nNeither do the aggravating circumstances 9 and 20 of article 10 apply, since, in \nthe present case, the quality of sex is inherent in the crime in such manner \nthat without it the deed could not have been committed ; nor may it be \nconsidered that the crime was attended by any other generic circumstance, \nespecially the particular one defined in article 11, for the reason that the \ndefendant does not come within the conditions that determine the application of \nthe said article, as amended by Act No. 2142. Consequently, the penalty provided \nfor the crime by law should be imposed upon the defendant in its medium \ndegree.<\/p>\n<p>In view of the fact that, for the reasons hereinbefore stated, the error \nassigned to the judgment appealed from has been duly refuted, we should and do \nhereby affirm the said judgment; provided, however, that the defendant shall be \nsentenced to the penalty of fourteen years eight months and one day of \n<em>reclusion temporal,<\/em> to the accessory penalties of article 59 of the \ncode, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000 and to pay the \ncosts of this instance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

But it \nis necessary, for the proper disposition of the contentions of counsel on this \nappeal, to add a further finding, to the effect that at the time when these \nproceedings were had in the court below, an appeal was pending from the judgment \nin favor of Antonio Flor Mata, though by special order of the court execution \nthereon was not stayed pending the appeal.<\/p>\n<p>Accepting the findings of the trial judge as correct, the only real question \nraised on this appeal relates to the preference given by the trial judge to the \nclaim of Antonio Flor Mata over that of Clara Lichauco.<\/p>\n<p>Antonio Flor Mata claims by virtue of a judgment rendered in his favor \nagainst Crisanto Lichauco on October 6, 1910, for P8,465.42 of which there \nremains unsatisfied the amount of P7,243.88. From this judgment an appeal was \nstill pending at the time when the interpleader proceedings were had in the \ncourt below, but, by special order of the court, execution on the judgment was \nnot stayed pending the appeal.<\/p>\n<p>Clara Lichauco, who is the aunt of Crisanto Lichauco, claims by virtue of a \njudgment for P17,666.60, rendered in favor of herself and her husband against \nCrisanto Lichauco on February 2, 1911.<\/p>\n<p>Under the doctrine laid down in the case of Peterson <em>vs.<\/em> Newberry (6 \nPhil. Rep., 260), there can be no question that Mata, whose judgment bears date \nof October 6,1910, having duly asserted his claim thereto, has a preference in \nthe distribution of his judgment debtor's funds over Clara Lichauco whose \njudgment bears date of February 6, 1911, unless it be held that the right of \npreference does not exist in favor of Mata because of the appeal from his \njudgment.<\/p>\n<p>We are of opinion that, both on reason and authority, Mata's right of \npreference should be secured to him notwithstanding the appeal; though of course \nthe decree for the distribution of the funds should be so formulated that the \namount to which he is entitled under his judgment will not be definitely turned \nover to him until and unless his judgment is affirmed on appeal; and the decree \nshould further provide for the disposition of the amount thus retained, in the \nevent that his judgment should be reversed in whole or in part.<\/p>\n<p>Two substantial objections have been advanced to our ruling in this \nregard.<\/p>\n<p>In the first place it is contended that the statutory authority for the \npreference in favor of Mata's judgment must be found in the provisions of \narticle 1924 of the code, and that this article secures the preference to \nsentencias firmes only\u2014that is to say, to judgments which are final in the sense \nthat no appeal lies therefrom. It must not be forgotten however that both the \nclassification and the incidents of judgments, orders and decrees have been \nlargely modified under the new Code of Civil Procedure, which is drawn in large \npart from American and English precedents, so that it is necessary to look \nrather to the spirit than the letter of the technical legal terminology used in \nthe Spanish code, when rules of law couched in the legal phrasing of that code \nare made applicable to the judgments, orders or decrees mentioned in the \nother.<\/p>\n<p>Section 144 of Act No. 190 provides that in certain cases the perfecting of a \nbill of exceptions does not have the effect of staying execution upon the \njudgment from which the appeal is perfected. No recourse lies from the order of \nthe court which secures this result, and it follows that when such an order is \nissued, the judgment creditor has the right to the immediate execution of his \njudgment, or in other words to have immediate recourse to the property of the \njudgment debtor for the recovery of the amount of the judgment. Until and unless \nthe time allowed for the perfecting of a bill of exceptions has expired without \nan appeal being taken, such a judgment is not a sentencia firme in the strictly \ntechnical sense of the word as used in Spanish legal terminology. The limitation \nof preferences by the Spanish legislator to <em>sentencias firmes,<\/em> as \ndistinguished from <em>sentencias<\/em> generally, would appear to be founded on \nthe fact that the right to share in the distribution of the funds of the debtor \ncould not logically accrue to the judgment creditor until and unless he has \nsecured the right of immediate recourse to the funds in course of distribution, \nand speaking broadly, it was by virtue of a <em>sentencia firme<\/em> that the \njudgment creditor secured this right to have immediate recourse to the judgment \ndebtor's property.<\/p>\n<p>The peculiar quality of <em>sentencias firmes<\/em> on which this preference \nrests having been impressed upon judgments under the new Code of Civil Procedure \nupon which execution is not stayed, the preference given to the former class of \njudgments must be held to be impressed in like manner on the latter class of \njudgments. We conclude therefore, without much hesitation, that where the new \ncode of procedure provides for judgments which give to the judgment creditor the \nright of immediate recourse to the judgment debtor's property, such judgments \ncome within the purview of the provisions of article 1924 of the Civil Code \nsecuring preference to <em>sentencias firmes.<\/em> In other words, a judgment \nupon which execution has not been stayed, under the provisions of section 144 of \nAct No. 190, is entitled to the preference provided for in article 1924 of the \nCivil Code.<\/p>\n<p>The second objection to our ruling in this case seems to be based on the \ntheory sometimes advanced in the United States that upon an appeal, the judgment \nof the lower court is merged in that of the superior court, and that as a result \nany preference incident to the former judgment is necessarily lost and destroyed \nthereby. We think, however, that the better doctrine, supported by the great \nweight of authority in the United States is that the lien of a judgment is not \nnecessarily destroyed by the perfecting of an appeal therefrom.<\/p>\n<p>Thus Black on Judgments (vol. I, par. 473) lays down the doctrine as follows, \nand supports the text with numerous citations of authority: \"It is generally \nheld that the lien of a judgment is not discharged by an appeal being taken, but \nmerely suspended; nor is the judgment on appeal a discharge of the lien of the \njudgment below. 'Even if there be a new judgment (e. g., of affirmance on \nappeal), this does not necessarily destroy the lien which the law has given, for \nit is competent for the law to keep the lien in existence, although a new \njudgment be predicated on the first.' And where a decree is reversed in part and \naffirmed as to the residue, the reversal in part does not destroy the lien of so \nmuch of the decree as is unreversed.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Thompson's \nAdministrator <em>vs.<\/em> Chapman's Administrator (83 Va., 215) the court said: \n\"It is familiar doctrine, that where a decree is reversed in part, and affirmed \nin part, the reversal does not destroy the lien of so much of the decree as is \nunreversed or affirmed.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Curtis vs. Root (28 111., 367), it was held that \"an appeal \ndoes not vacate the lien of the judgment, it only suspends its execution. A \njudgment during appeal not only holds its lien, but will extend it over property \nacquired pending the appeal.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Planters Bank <em>vs.<\/em> Calvit (3 Smedes and Marshall, \nMiss., 143), it was held, quoting the syllabus, that \"judgment is but a security \nfor a debt, and the payment of the debt is the object of the lien. Lien of \njudgment arises by mere implication of law; and although a new judgment is \npredicated on the first, this does not necessarily destroy the lien which the \nlaw has given, for it is competent for the law to keep the lien in \nexistence.\"<\/p>\n<p>In discussing this case, Chief Justice Starkey said: \"To me it seems a \ncontradiction that the judgment of affirmance, the act which declares the \njudgment was regular, and constituted a perfect lien from the time it was \nrendered in the circuit court, should be considered as the act which destroys \nthe validity of the lien. <em>Affirmed<\/em> means to ratify or confirm, and not \nto destroy. Still it is said, this must be the effect, because the original \njudgment is satisfied, or merged or extinguished by the new judgment. Now I \nmaintain that the first judgment is neither satisfied, merged, nor extinguished, \nby the new judgment of affirmance.\"<\/p>\n<p>See also Hardee <em>vs.<\/em> Stovall (1 Ga., 92); Dewey <em>vs.<\/em> Latson \n(6 Cal., 130); Moore <em>vs. <\/em>Rittenhouse (15 Ohio St., 310).<\/p>\n<p>It is true that in a few states it has been held that where a judgment has \nbeen superseded on error, the judgment of the inferior court is merged in that \nof the superior court, and the lien of the former is destroyed by the suing out \nof the writ of error and the giving of bond with surety (Campbell vs. Spence, 4 \nAla., 943); but we think that in this jurisdiction the general doctrine as above \nset forth correctly sets forth the rule which should prevail under our Code of \nCivil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the trial court correctly declares a \npreference in favor of Mata's judgment, but the trial judge seems to have \noverlooked the fact that this judgment was at that time pending on appeal and \nsubject to modification or reversal. Provision should have been made either for \nthe retention of a sufficient part of the funds in the hands of the clerk, \npending the determination of the appeal on Mata's judgment, or the filing of a \nsatisfactory refunding bond in the event of modification or reversal of that \njudgment on appeal.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed, \nwith costs against the appellant; but upon the return of the record to the court \nbelow, the proper orders will be entered as above indicated, with a view to \nsecuring the rights of the parties in the event of the reversal or modification \nof Mata's judgment.<br\/><br\/><em>Arellano, C.

Juana Fernandez, now \ndeceased, filed through an attorney a complaint against Alvaro Fernandez and \nEngracia Lavadia, alleging therein that, on April 13, 1905, the plaintiff \nEmigdio Umale and his wife, during her lifetime, sold to the defendant spouses \nunder <em>pacto de retro<\/em> or right of repurchase, without fixing any period \nfor the redemption, a parcel of land planted with about one hundred coconut \ntrees, its boundaries being specified, situated in the pueblo of Pagsanjan, \nLaguna; that, although the price of the sale was in the beginning P600, it was \nsubsequently increased to P816.80, on account of the plaintiffs' having received \nfrom the defendants various partial payments as an increase of the price; that, \non June 12, 1909, the defendants, renouncing their right of having irrevocably \nacquired the ownership of the property sold under <em>pacto de retro<\/em>, owing \nto the lapse of the legal period of four years, granted to the plaintiffs an \nextension of time for its redemption and executed for this purpose the document \nin Tagalog, the translation of which is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I, Alvaro Fernandez, married, have issued this receipt in favor of Emigdio \nUmale as proof of our agreement concerning their coconut land which has been \nsold to us under <em>pacto de retro<\/em> and which they may redeem at any time \nthey may have money of their own without borrowing it from another person. In \nwitness whereof, I have signed hereunder, in Pagsanjan, on this date, June 12, \n1909.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That, on or about November 9, 1911, the plaintiffs delivered to the \ndefendants and the latter accepted the sum of P800, plaintiff Umale's own money, \non account of the price of the redemption of the said property, and that, on or \nabout the 11th of the same month, the plaintiffs delivered to the defendants and \nthe latter accepted, on the same account, the sum of P18.80, plaintiff Umale's \nown money, which second delivery completed the total sum of the price of the \npurchase and sale, under right of redemption, of the property in question which \nwas thereby resold to the plaintiffs who, pursuant to the agreement made, took \npossession of the said land so redeemed; and that the defendants not only had \nnot, up to date, executed the instrument of redemption, but they were disturbing \nthe plaintiffs in their possession of the redeemed property, by means of a \ncomplaint charging them with usurpation of possession, notwithstanding that the \nparties had stipulated the transfer of the possession of the said property to \nthe plaintiffs, by virtue of the said redemption. The latter, therefore, prayed \nthat the defendants be ordered to execute in favor of the plaintiffs the \ninstrument of redemption of the said property, with the costs of the suit \nagainst the defendants.<\/p>\n<p>The demurrer to the complaint was overruled by an order of February 12, 1912, \nan exception thereto was taken by the defendants, and the latter's counsel set \nforth in answer to the complaint: that he made a general denial of each and all \nof the allegations of the complaint, and, as a special defense, alleged that \nEmigdio Umale and his wife, Juana Fernandez, sold and conveyed to the defendants \nthe disputed parcel of land, without any special stipulation as to the period \nfor its redemption, and that the vendors did not avail themselves of their right \nof repurchase within the term allowed by law, wherefore the property in \nquestion, free of all charge and encumbrance, now belonged to the defendants. He \ntherefore prayed that his clients be absolved from the complaint, with the costs \nagainst the plaintiffs.<\/p>\n<p>After a hearing of the case and an examination of the parol and documentary \nevidence introduced by both parties, the court rendered the judgment \naforementioned, to which counsel for the defendants excepted and asked for a \nrehearing and a reopening of the case. This motion was overruled, an exception \nwas taken by the said counsel and, the proper bill of exceptions having been \npresented by him, the same was approved, certified, and forwarded to the clerk \nof this court, together with all the documents and other evidence in the \ncase.<br\/><br\/>In this suit counsel for the plaintiffs seeks to have the court \norder the defendants to execute, in behalf of his clients, an instrument of \nresale of the property mentioned in the complaint, with the costs against the \ndefendants. These latter alleged in their answer that, since the plaintiffs did \nnot avail themselves of their right of redemption within the period fixed by \nlaw, the property in question now belongs to the defendants, and prayed that \nthey be absolved from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiffs.<\/p>\n<p>After a careful examination of the issues raised in this suit by the \nlitigating parties, all the Justices of this court unanimously agree that the \njudgment appealed from should be affirmed, with the costs against the \nappellants.<\/p>\n<p>The majority of this court accept the findings of the trial court, as well as \nthe findings that the plaintiffs\u00a6\u00a6 are entitled to redeem the property sold to \nthe defendants under right of redemption and that the repurchase of the property \nin question was effected on the 9th and 11th of November, 1911, through the \ndelivery by the plaintiffs to the defendants of the sum of P816.80 as the price \nof the redemption and of the property redeemed by the plaintiffs from the \ndefendants.<\/p>\n<p>Although the period of four years fixed, by law for the resale of the \nproperty in dispute had already expired on April 14, 1909, as the sale under \nright of repurchase was effected without stipulating any period for the \nredemption, wherefore, after the lapse of the four years prescribed by article \n1508 of the Civil Code, the defendant-vendees irrevocably acquired the ownership \nof the property sold, pursuant to the provisions of the succeeding article, \n1509, of the same code, for the reason that the vendors had not returned to the \nvendee the price of the sale or made the other payments specified in article \n1518 of the said code; yet inasmuch as the said spouses, the vendees, had \nrenounced their right and one of them, the husband Alvaro Fernandez, had granted \nto the plaintiff-vendors the privilege of redeeming the property at any time, as \nappears from the document executed and signed by the said Fernandez on June 12, \n1909, Exhibit B inserted in the complaint, through the renewal of the period for \nredemption or the extension of the same, it must be held that the said period \nfor redemption was still running, and that the vendors were entitled to redeem \nthe property sold. It was under these premises that Emigdio Umale and his two \nchildren, Margarita and Miguel, the successors of their deceased mother, Juana \nFernandez, delivered to Fernandez' wife the redemption price, P816.80, and, a \nfew days afterwards, took charge and entered into the possession of the redeemed \nproperty, in accordance with the agreement made with her.<\/p>\n<p>It is held that the granting of a new period, or the extension of that \nprescribed in article 1508 of the Civil Code, is valid and effective, as it is \nnot contrary to any provision of law and because it sprang from the \ndisinterestedness of the vendees and the desire to benefit the vendors, the \nredemptioners, for the reason that the deceased Juana Fernandez, Umale's wife \nand the other plaintiffs' mother, was a niece of the defendant Alvaro \nFernandez.<\/p>\n<p>In the absence of an express stipulation with regard to the period of \nredemption the purchaser, in the exercise of the freedom to make contracts that \nis possessed by all, has the power to extend the period allowed by law, provided \nthat the new period stipulated does not exceed the ten years fixed by article \n1508 of the code. For nothing in this article prohibits an extension, by \nagreement, of the four years, which is the period prescribed by law in cases \nwhere, in sales with right of repurchase, no period for redemption has been \nfixed by the parties.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment \nappealed from are deemed to have been refuted, the said judgment should be, as \nit is hereby, affirmed, with the costs against the appellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Indeed, Fernandez' wife, on the 9th and 11th of \nNovember, 1911, two years and some months after the execution of said document, \nreceived in two payments the sum of P816.80, the price of the land resold to the \nplaintiffs. Several days afterwards she delivered the land to them, and on the \n13th of November of the same year the defendant Fernandez forwarded from Manila \nto the plaintiff Emigdio Umale, residing in Pagsanjan, Laguna, a rough draft of \nthe instrument for the purpose of execution and attestation thereof before a \nnotary.<\/p>\n<p>These acts, the acceptance of the price of the land, the sending of a rough \ndraft of the instrument to be executed for the purpose of the resale, and the \ndelivery of the price of the property to the new purchasers, its previous \nowners, evidently and unquestionably show that the positive intention of Alvaro \nFernandez and his wife was to restore or resell the said land to its former \nowners, who, through the lapse of the legal period allowed for its redemption, \nhad lost their right of ownership therein.<\/p>\n<p>If afterwards the instrument, the rough draft of which had been made by \nAlvaro Fernandez, was not signed by the contracting parties, it was due to the \nfact that these latter could not agree upon the terms in which the instrument \nwas to be drawn up, for Fernandez noted the absence therefrom of certain \nconditions contained in the rough draft, which were unacceptable to Emigdio \nUmale and his children, and, as Fernandez and his wife refused to sign the \nproposed instrument, it was afterwards returned, unsigned, to the plaintiffs, \nwho appeared before the same notary and declared that they annulled the said \nnotarial document and revoked the concessions therein made in behalf of the \ndefendants, Alvaro Fernandez and Engracia Lavadia. (Exhibit C.)<\/p>\n<p>Besides the foregoing, the best proof that it was the intention of the \ncontracting parties to resell or sell anew the said land to those who were its \nowners, is certain clauses of the said instrument, the rough draft of which, as \nbefore stated, was made by the defendant Fernandez, which clauses set forth, \namong other things, that record is made of the fact that, as the plaintiffs had \nfailed to redeem the land from 1906 to 1911, they were no longer entitled to do \nso, since the period fixed by law had expired; although, through steps taken by \nthe plaintiffs, they had induced the spouses Alvaro Fernandez and Engracia \nLavadia to return or resell to them the said land at the same price, but subject \nto the encumbrances and conditions therein contained.<\/p>\n<p>These statements set forth in the said proposed instrument agree with the \nfacts that the price of the sale was received by the wife of the defendant \nFernandez and delivery of the land was made to the plaintiffs. It is therefore \nunquestionable that it was the intention of the defendants to return by means of \na new sale the land acquired by the previous sale, and the words or phrases \ncontained in the document Exhibit B which relate to the previous sale and to the \nright of redemption should be understood as omitted and they cannot in any wise \naffect the force and validity of the new contract for the redemption of the land \nby plaintiffs, on account of their being contrary to the explicit provisions of \narticles 1508 and 1509 of the Civil Code.<\/p>\n<p>After the lapse of the period of four years fixed in article 1508, in default \nof an express stipulation relative to the said period, which began to run from \nthe date of the contract, the contracting parties, who did not see fit to \nstipulate any definite date for the redemption, have no fight to extend the \nlegal period that has already elapsed, nor to fix a new period for the exercise \nof the right of redemption which had already expired by operation of law and the \nfailure of the vendors to comply with the obligation of refunding to the vendees \nthe price of the sale, for the latter consequently irrevocably acquired the \nownership of the land sold. If the vendees afterwards alienated and returned the \nproperty, they did so by virtue of another new contract of sale, independent and \ndistinct from the previous one already terminated.<\/p>\n<p>The intention of the contracting parties, with respect to the new sale \ncovenanted between them, is evident and therefore should prevail over the words \nthat seem to contradict it. Moreover, in order to judge the intention of the \ncontracting parties, attention must principally be paid to their acts, \ncontemporaneous and subsequent to the contract the contract should be construed \nin the sense most suitable to give it effect, and when it involves a valuable \nconsideration any doubt should be decided in favor of the greatest reciprocity \nof interests. These rules of interpretation are found in the provisions \ncontained in articles 1281, 1282, 1284, and 1289 of the Civil Code. The contract \nof new sale, covenanted, consummated, and executed by the parties thereto, \nshould, therefore, be upheld and the defendants should be compelled to execute \nthe instrument demanded by the plaintiffs.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby some of the errors assigned to the \njudgment appealed from are deemed to have been refuted, the said judgment should \nbe affirmed, with the costs against the appellants, it being understood that the \ninstrument to be executed is one of sale.<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/div>",

On March 30, 1903, a public document was executed and \nsigned by all of the above parties and the defendant, Gelasio Calupitan, wherein \nit was stated that Rosales and Zolaivar, with the consent of Lucido, sold all \ntheir rights and obligations pertaining to the property in question to Calupitan \nfor the amount of the purchase price together with 1 per cent per month interest \nthereon up to the time of redemption, or 1,687 Mexican dollars, plus 33.74 \nMexican dollars, the amount of the interest. It will be observed that the \ncomputation of the transfer price is in accordance with section 465 of the Code \nof Civil Procedure. On the same day Lucido and Calupitan executed the following: \ndocument:\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I, Gelasio Calupitan y Agarao, married, certify that I have delivered this \ninstrument to Leonardo Lucido y Vidal to witness that his lands, which appear in \nthe instrument I hold from the deputy sheriff and for which he has accepted \nmoney from me, I have ceded to him all the irrigated lands until such time as he \nmay repurchase all said lands from me (not only the irrigated ones), as also the \nVienna chairs, the five-lamp chandelier, a lamp stand, two wall tables, and a \nmarble table; no coconut tree on said irrigated land is included. Apart from \nthis, our real agreement is to permit three (3) whole years to elapse, reckoned \nfrom the date of this instrument, which has been drawn up in duplicate, before \nhe may redeem or repurchase them from me.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The lower court held that this document constituted a sale with the right to \nconventional redemption set forth in articles 1507 <em>et seq.<\/em> of the Civil \nCode. The present action not having been instituted until February 17, 1910, the \nfurther question arose as to whether the redemption period had expired, which \nthe lower court decided in the negative. The lower court further found as a fact \nthat Lucido had prior to the institution of the action offered the redemption \nprice to the defendant, who refused it, and that this offer was a sufficient \ncompliance with article 1518 of the Civil Code. The decision of the lower court \nwas that the property in question should be returned to the plaintiff. From this \njudgment the defendant appealed, and all three of the above rulings of the court \nare assigned as errors.<\/p>\n<p>1. Considerable doubt might arise as to the correctness of the ruling of the \nlower court upon the first question, if the document executed by the execution \npurchasers and the parties to this action stood alone. In that document it \nappears that Calupitan acquired the rights and obligations of the execution \npurchasers pertaining to the property in question. These rights and obligations \nare denned in the Code of Civil Procedure to be the ownership of the property \nsold, subject only to the right of redemption on the part of the judgment debtor \nor a redemptioner, within one year from the date of the sale. (Sees. 463-465, \nCode Civ. Proc.) Were this the nature of the transaction between the parties, \nhowever, the intervention of Lucido in the transfer would be wholly unnecessary. \nHence, the fact that he intervened as an interested party is at least some \nindication that the parties intended something more or different by the document \nin question than a simple assignment of the rights and obligations of the \nexecution purchasers to a third person.<\/p>\n<p>Any doubt, however, as to the character of this transact tion is removed by \nthe agreement entered into between Lucido and Calupitan on the same day. In this \ndocument it is distinctly stipulated that the right to redeem the property is \npreserved to Lucido, to be exercised after the expiration of three years. The \nright to repurchase must necessarily imply a former ownership of the \nproperty.<\/p>\n<p>Further indication that Calupitan himself considered this transaction as a \nsale with the right to conventional redemption is to be found in his original \nanswer to the complaint. This original answer was introduced in evidence by the \nplaintiff over the objection of the defendant. Its admission was proper, \nespecially in view of the fact that it was signed by Calupitan himself, who was \nat the time acting as his own attorney.<\/p>\n<p>Jones on Evidence (sees. 272, 273), after remarking that the earlier cases \nwere not in harmony on the point, says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Many of the cases holding that pleadings were inadmissible ad admissions \nwere based on the theory that most of the allegations were merely pleader's \nmatter\u2014fiction statedly counsel and sanctioned by the courts; The whole modern \ntendency is to reject this view and to treat pleadings as statements of the real \nissues in the cause and hence as admissions of the parties, having weight \naccording to the circumstances of each case. But some of the authorities still \nhold that if the pleading is not signed by the party there should be some proof \nthat he has authorized it.<\/p>\n<p>\"On the same principle where amended pleadings have been filed, allegations \nin the original pleadings are held admissible, but in such case the original \npleadings can have no effect, unless formally offered in \nevidence.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In this original answer it was expressly stated that the transaction was one \nof sale with the right to repurchase governed by the provisions of articles 1507 \net seq. of the Civil Code.<\/p>\n<p>It further appears from the uncontradicted testimony of the plaintiff that he \nfurnished $120 Mexican of the amount necessary to redeem the property from the \nexecution purchasers. It therefore appears beyond dispute that the redemption of \nthe property from the execution purchasers was made by the plaintiff himself by \nmeans of a loan furnished by the defendant Calupitan, who took possesion of the \nmajor portion of the land as his security for its redemption, The ruling of the \nlower court that the transaction between Lucido and Calupitan was one of \npurchase and sale with the right to redeem was therefore correct.<\/p>\n<p>2. By the terms of his agreement with Calupitan the plaintiff could not \nexercise his right to redeem the property within three years from March 30, \n1903; and the lower court arrived at the date upon which the right to redeem \nexpired by computing four years from March 30, 1906, on the ground that there \nwas no express agreement as to how long the right to repurchase, once available, \nshould continue. Counsel for the appellant admits in his brief that the \ncomplaint was filed forty-three days before the expiration of this period. In \naccordance with our decision in Rosales <em>vs.<\/em> Reyes and Ordoveza (25 \nPhil. Rep., 495), we hold that this ruling of the court was correct.<\/p>\n<p>3. The court Held that the plaintiff had actually tendered the redemption \nprice to the defendant Calupitan. After an examination of the evidence of record \nas to-this finding of fact, we concur therein. We discussed the legal \nsufficiency of such a tender in the above-cited case of Rosales vs. Reyes and \nOrdoveza, and held that it was sufficient. This assignment of error must \ntherefore be held to be unfounded.<\/p>\n<p>4. The defendants Oreta and Bueno have no interest in the subject matter of \nthis action. It appears that the defendant Dorado purchased the land from his \ncodefendant Calupitan subsequent to the tender of the redemption price to the \nlatter by the plaintiff. It does not appear that the property was ever \nregistered by any one, nor was the document of sale with the right to repurchase \nregistered by either Calupitan or Lucido. No evidence of the purchase of the \nland from Calupitan by Dorado is of record with the exception of the oral \ntestimony although it may be taken as established that such a sale actually took \nplace, since all the parties interested agree on this point. Dorado himself \ntestified that he purchased the property with the knowledge that Calupitan had \npurchased the property from Lucido subject to the right of redemption, and \ninsists that he purchased with the knowledge and consent of Lucido. Lucido \ndenies that he was aware of the sale to Dorado until after it had taken place. \nUpon this state of facts, it is clear that the following provisions of article \n1510 of the Civil Code are applicable:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The vendor may bring his action against every possessor whose right arises \nfrom that of the vendee, even though in the second contract no mention should \nhave been made of the conventional redemption; without prejudice to the \nprovisions of the Mortgage Law with regard to third persons.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The provisions of the Mortgage Law with regard to third persons are clearly \nnot applicable to Dorado. (Manresa, vol. 10, p. 317.)<\/p>\n<p>5. The lower court ordered the redelivery of the land to the plaintiff upon \nhis payment to Calupitan of P1,600, plus the costs entailed in the execution of \nthe document of repurchase. The amount paid to the purchasers at the execution \nsale for the redemption of the property was $1,720.74 Mexican. Of this amount \nthe plaintiff furnished $120 Mexican, and Calupitan the balance of $1,600.74 \nMexican. No amount is fixed in the document of purchase and sale above set \nforth, but the amount borrowed from Calupitan to redeem the land from the \nexecution sale being thus clearly established no objection can be or is made to \nthe plaintiff's paying this amount. In ordering the payment of this amount to \nthe defendant the lower court failed to reduce it to Philippine currency. On \nthis appeal plaintiff alleges that this amount in Mexican currency exceeds the \namount he actually owes to the. defendant by about P100, but that rather than \nspend the time and incur the expense attendant to a new trial for the purpose of \ndetermining the equivalent of this amount in Philippine currency he is agreeable \nto pay the defendant P1,600.74 Philippine currency, as the redemption price of \nthe property. In view of this offer and in case it is accepted by the defendant \nit will be unnecessary to go through the formality of a new trial for the \npurpose of ascertaining the amount of the redemption price in Philippine \ncurrency. In view of the fact that it is claimed that Calupitan has sold the \nland in question to his codefendant, Macario Dorado, and it not clearly \nappearing to whom the plaintiff should pay the P1,600.74, we think this amount \nshould be turned over to the clerk of the Court of First Instance of the \nProvince of Laguna to be held by him until it is determined in the proper manner \nwho is the owner of this amount, Calupitan or Dorado.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, judgment will be entered directing the defendants \nCalupitan and Dorado to deliver the possession of the land in question to the \nplaintiff upon the plaintiff's depositing with the clerk of the court the sum of \nP1,600.74, to be disposed of in the manner above set forth. In all other \nrespects the judgment appealed from is affirmed with costs against the \nappellants Calupitan and Dorado.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Were it not for the fact that I regard the decision in this case so \nfundamental in character, and its effects on the law relative to sales with the \nright of repurchase so far-reaching, I would be silent. I cannot permit to pass \nunchallenged a doctrine which, in my judgment, if followed in the future, as it \nis to be presumed it will be, renders entirely ineffective the main provisions \nof the statute law governing a given subject. This decision, taken together with \nthat of Rosales vs. Reyes and Ordoveza (25 Phil. Rep., 495), I regard as an \nabrogation, a repeal, of article 1508, of the Civil Code, together with these \narticles which depend upon it I dissented in the case of Rosales <em>vs.<\/em> \nReyes and Ordoveza. Only one phase of the question was really raised, presented, \nor argued in that case. A further study of the questions involved both in that \ncase and the one at bar has brought the strong conviction that the decisions in \nthese cases are not only wrong in a fundamental sense but result in a \ndestruction of the provisions of the Civil Code governing the contract known as \na sale with the right of repurchase. The question raised and argued in this case \ncovers the whole field, whereas in Rosales <em>vs.<\/em> Reyes and Ordoveza only \none phase was touched by the briefs of the parties. I feel that the decision in \nRosales vs. Reyes and Ordoveza should be reexamined in view of the fact that the \nreal questions involved were not presented or argued and, therefore, not \nconsidered in the opinion in that case.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">THE FACTS. <\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff, by a written instrument, sold to the defendant certain lands, \nexpressly reserving to himself the right to repurchase the same at a given \nprice, <em>but without fixing in the instrument the period within which the \nrepurchase must be made.<\/em> The conveyance contained a provision that the \nrepurchase could <em>not<\/em> be made \"until after three years from this date.\" \nThis document bears date <em>March 30, 1903.<\/em> The contract became effective \nand went into operation on its date; the vendor receiving his money and the \npurchaser his title and other rights created by the contract on that date.<\/p>\n<p>This action was commenced <em>February 17, 1910,<\/em> nearly seven years \nafter the date of the contract, to compel the defendant to accept the sum \nspecified in the conveyance as the repurchase price and to deliver to the \nplaintiff the premises described therein.<\/p>\n<p>These facts are admitted.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">THE LAW APPLICABLE TO THE CASE.<\/p>\n<p>As the facts are admitted so, also, is the law governing the case. It is \nadmitted by all that the first paragraph of article 150S of the Civil Code must \nrule in the decision of this case. I quote that article as. well as those \npreceding and succeeding, to which it refers or which are material:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Art. 1506. The sale shall be rescinded for the same causes as all other \nobligations, and furthermore for those mentioned in the preceding chapters and \nby conventional or legal redemption.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 1507. Conventional redemption \nshall exist when the vendor reserves to himself the right to recover the thing \nsold, binding himself to fulfill that which is stated in article 1518, and \nwhatever more may have been stipulated.<\/p>\n<p>\"Art. 1508. The right stated in the preceding article, in default of an \nexpress stipulation, shall last four years to be counted from the date of the \ncontract.<\/p>\n<p>\"When a stipulation exists, the term shall not exceed ten years.<\/p>\n<p>\"Art. 1509. When the vendor does not comply with the provisions of article \n1518, the vendee shall irrevocably acquire the ownership of the thing sold.<\/p>\n<p>\"Art. 1518. A vendor can not exercise the right of redemption without \nreturning to the vendee the price of the sale, and furthermore:<\/p>\n<p>\"1. The expenses of the contract and any other legitimate payment made on \naccount of the sale.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. The useful and necessary expenses incurred by the thing \nsold.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The court expressly holds that the period of limitation is <em>four<\/em> \nyears and not <em>ten,<\/em> \"on the ground that there was <em>no express \nagreement as to how long the right to repurchase * * * should continue.\" \n<\/em>(See opinion.)<\/p>\n<p>The complaint I make against the decision is that, while it expressly holds \nthat article 1508 is applicable, <em>it does not apply it,<\/em> and bases the \nrefusal to apply on a principle which destroys the article altogether. It \ndeclares that the four year limitation applies, but, instead of counting it \n<em>\"from the date of the contract\" as expressly<\/em> required by the article \nreferred to, begins to count it three years from the date of the contract, thus \nholding the life of the redemption period to be <em>seven<\/em> years instead of \n<em>four.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I regard the findings and conclusions of the court not only fundamentally \nerroneous but preeminently destructive in their results. This is so evident to \nme that I enter upon the further exposition of the case with the embarrassment \nwhich one always feels when he attempts to demonstrate a proposition which he \nregards as self-evident. The mere statement of a correct proposition is its own \ngreatest support and the bare statement of a proposition inherently bad is its \nmost perfect refutation. The bald statement that a party is entitled to seven \nyears in which to redeem when the code expressly says he shall have but four is \nabout all that need be said to demonstrate the unsoundness of the statement. But \nin order that all the questions involved in the case as well as the results of \nthe doctrine laid down may be fully developed, I proceed.<\/p>\n<p>I shall first inquire what the purpose of article 1508 is. After finishing \nthat inquiry I shall proceed to determine how the article affects the contracts \nwith which it deals.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">AS TO THE PURPOSE.<\/p>\n<p>Concerning this there can be no question. That is already very largely \nsettled. We held in the case of Yadao <em>vs.<\/em> Yadao (20 Phil. Rep., \n260):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A <em>pacto de retro<\/em> is, in a certain aspect, the suspension of the \ntitle to the land involved. We are of the opinion that it was the intention of \nthe legislature to limit the continuance of such a condition, with the purpose \nthat the title to the real estate in question should be definitely placed, it \nbeing, in the opinion of the legislature, against public policy to permit such \nan uncertain condition relative to the title to real estate to continue for more \nthan ten years.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Manresa, commenting on the article under consideration (vol. 10, p. 302), \nsays in this connection:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Above all we should note that the question of the period within which the \nrepurchase may be made is unanimously considered as a question of public \ninterest. Portalis has already observed that it is not a good thing that the \ntitle to property should be left for any long period of time subject to \nindefinite conditions of this nature. For this reason, the intention of the code \nis restrictive and limitative, and in our opinion all doubts should be resolved \nhaving this intention in mind, as such intention is, without doubt, in better \naccord with the spirit of the law.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Scaevola (vol. 23, p, 759) refers to the period of redemption created by \narticle 1508 as the \"period within which the party must repurchase so as not to \nleave longer in an<br\/>uncertain condition the -title to the premises.\" He also \nsays:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Yet, with a keen desire for the public good, for the better interests of \nsociety and for the greater order and development of property, every solicitous \nlegislator can not but perceive the danger that would lurk in redemption by \nleaving to the unrestricted will of the contracting parties a remedy which might \nin the course of time become the means of maintaining the ownership of things in \na pernicious incertitude, perhaps indefinitely, and might possibly seriously \naffect the orderly conveyance of property.<\/p>\n<p>\"The illustrious Jovellanos said in his superb report on the Agrarian Law, \nthat the appreciation of property is always the measure of its care . * * *; \nhence it is that the laws which protect its exclusive utilization strengthen, \nwhile those that threaten this, lessen and weaken the affection for it; the \nformer stimulate individual interest and the latter discourage it; the first are \nfavorable, the second unjust and disastrous, to the development of agriculture.\" \n(Scaevola, Civil Code, vol. 28, p. 749.)<\/p>\n<p>\"A long term for redemption renders the tenure of property uncertain and \nredounds to its detriment, for neither does the precarious holder cultivate the \nground with the same interest as the owner, nor does he properly attend to the \npreservation of the building, and owing to the fact that his enjoyment of the \nproperty is temporary, he endeavors above all to derive the greatest benefit \ntherefrom, economizing to that end even the most essential expenses.\" (Scaevola, \nCivil Code, vol. 23, p. 767.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, there can be no doubt that one of the aims of those who framed the \nlaw relative to the <em>retroventa<\/em> was to protect, as far as possible, the \nborrower from the machinations of usurers. The purpose in limiting the duration \nof a sale of this nature was not only to preserve the stability and certainty of \nownership but. also to prevent the usurer from fixing his own time for the \nrepayment of the purchase price. While it may be true that a short term is the \njoy of the money-lender, as contended by some, that is so only in a limited \nsense and in an especially limited sense when related to a sale with right of \nrepurchase. The purchaser having the absolute right of possession up to the \nmoment of repurchase, very serious results would follow not only to the vendor \nbut to society as well if he were permitted to fix, without limitation, the date \nwhen the repurchase could be made.<\/p>\n<p>Having seen what the purpose of the Civil Code was in fixing periods beyond \nwhich the right to repurchase cannot extend, whether the parties agree upon the \ntime or not, I next proceed to ascertain how the law impresses itself upon the \ncontract of the parties.<\/p>\n<p>Let us make the law personal and permit it to speak for itself. It says to \npersons entering into a contract of sale with the right to repurchase: \"You \nyourselves may fix the time within which the repurchase may be made; but while \nyou may fix that period and write it in your contract, I, the law, will myself \nbecome a third party to the contract and write therein a provision which neither \nof you can evade or escape, which is that the period cannot exceed ten years and \nthat the ten years shall be counted from the date of the contract You may also, \nif you wish, refrain from fixing in your contract a period within which the \nrepurchase must be made; but do not think that, by refusing or failing to fix \nthe period, you may thereby let the contract run as it pleases you and permit \nthe period to drag along indefinitely. If you do not fix the period, I, the law, \nwill myself become a third party to that contract and will write therein a \nprovision which neither of you can, by any sort of legerdemain, evade or escape, \nwhich is that the repurchase must be made within four years, and that the said \nfour years <em>shall be counted from the date of the contract.\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<p>This is what the law says, in effect, to the parties to the contract which I \nam discussing. Into every contract of sale with right of repurchase the law \nitself writes a term. The parties themselves are not free to contract as they \nwill. They may make only a part of the contract. The law makes the remainder. \nThe parties may contract as they will in relation to those matters within their \npowers and may create, destroy, alter and suspend rights and obligations as they \nplease; but may they do the same with regard to the terms which the<em> law<\/em> \nwrites into their contract or the rights and obligations which it creates? It \nwould seem not; and yet the decision of the court in this case permits precisely \nthat. The decision lays down the proposition and applies it to the case under \ndiscussion that, while the contract between the parties is in full force and \neffect <em>from its date,<\/em> the vendor having received the purchase price and \nthe purchaser his title and his possession or income on and from that date, \nnevertheless, the parties may, at will, suspend the force and operation of the \nterm which the law wrote into the contract. In other words, although a contract \nis in full force and effect and in complete operation, the parties may suspend \nthe law applicable thereto. The contention that, although a contract may be \nperfected and in operation, the parties enjoying their respective rights \nthereunder, they may permit the application to suah contract of only such law or \nlaws as pleases them and <em>when<\/em> it pleases them needs only to be stated \nto provoke its immediate rejection. Yet this is in effect what the parties to \nthe contract before us have done. They have made a contract to which the \nfour-year limitation is concededly (the court so finds expressly) applicable. \nThe contract goes into instant operation, the parties exercising their \nrespective rights and assuming their respective obligation's there-under. In \nspite, however, of all this, they are permitted to suspend for three years the \nlaw applicable to the contract and to say that it shall not apply for that \nperiod; that is, they are allowed to say, with full effect, that the four years \nshall not begin to run from the date of the contract, as provided by law, but \nfrom some other date which they themselves fix.<\/p>\n<p>In order to arrive at this, to me, extraordinary result, the <em>date<\/em> of \na contract of sale with right of repurchase is held, in effect, without \nsignificance in applying article 1508 of the Civil Code to such contract. This \nholding is very serious in its results for, next to the period itself, the most \nimportant factor in such a contract is, for the purpose before us, the date \nthereof. This is too evident to require words when we note that article 1508, as \nwe have so often seen, expressly requires that the four-year period shall be \n\"counted from the <em>date<\/em> of the contract.\" Nevertheless, no importance \nseems to have been attached to the date of the contract in the application of \nsaid article. Is the <em>date<\/em> of the contract mentioned or even remotely \nreferred to in the decision in this case? Yes, the date is expressly found; but \n<em>not for the purpose of fixing the time from which the four years mentioned \nin the law should be counted;<\/em> but, rather, for the purpose of fixing the \ntime from which it should not be counted. Is the date of the contract the \nsubject of consideration in the case of Rosales <em>vs.<\/em> Reyes and Ordoveza, \nreferred to in the decision of this case? Yes; it was expressly found therein; \nbut, as I understand it, no consideration was given to <em>that date with the \nobject of fixing the precise time from which the four years should run.<\/em> On \nthe contrary, whatever attention was given to the <em>date,<\/em> was given for \nthe purpose, <em>and the sole purpose,<\/em> of fixing the point from which the \n<em>three years' suspension of the right to repurchase should be counted.<\/em> \nNowhere, in either case, has the court, so far as I can see, given the slightest \nconsideration to the date of the contract as an element in applying article \n1508. This seems clearly so, for, after finding and fixing the dates of the \ncontracts in both cases, as the court <em>expressly <\/em>did in Rosales \n<em>vs.<\/em> Reyes and Ordoveza and expressly and specifically does in the case \nat bar, the court refuses to count the four years from that date, <em>as article \n1508 absolutely requires,<\/em> but, instead, counts the four years from a point \nplaced <em>three years after<\/em> the date of the contract. It would seem that \nwhere the law requires a thing to be done within four years from a date, the \nwhole problem is solved when the date is found and fixed. Absolutely nothing \nremains but plain addition. No question arises, and none has been even hinted at \nby the parties of the court, as to the suspension, or the setting forward, of \nthe <em>date of the contract<\/em> three years, or any other time. The court has \nfound the date and set it out and fixed it in this case as in the other. It has \nexpressly found in this case over and over again that the date of the contract \nis <em>that which it bears,<\/em> namely, March 30,<em>1903<\/em>, and \n<em>not<\/em> March 30, <em>1906.<\/em> The decision says: \"On March 30, 1903, a \npublic document was executed,\" referring to the contract before us. The decision \nquotes the contract, which contains these words: \"The lands cannot be redeemed \nuntil after three years from <em>this date.<\/em>\" \"This date\" is March 30, 1903. \nThe court again expressly refers to the date of the contract in the paragraph of \nthe decision numbered two. There is absolutely no question therefore, of \nsuspending or setting forward the <em>date of the contract<\/em> three years, as \nthe court has found that the parties did <em>not<\/em> do it or attempt to do it \nbut, instead, fixed the date <em>which it bears<\/em> as the date of the \ncontract. Why, then, is the four years not counted from that date instead of \nMarch 30, <em>1906?<\/em> I find it impossible to explain this satisfactorily to \nmyself. The court itself seems to give no explanation either in this case or in \nRosales <em>vs.<\/em> Reyes and Ordoveza. The only thing we find in this \nconnection is in the latter case where the court says: \"In all such cases it \nwould seem that the vendor should be allowed four years <em>from the expiration \nof the time within which the right to redeem could not be exercised <\/em>* * *.\" \nThis is not an explanation of the action of the court, as I understand it. It \nrefers to no law, cites no article of the Civil Code, but simply states that \nthis is what \"should be allowed.\" The point, it seems to me, is what does the \n<em>law<\/em> say ? Does article 1508 provide that the four years shall be \ncounted \"from the expiration of the time within which the right to redeem could \nnot be exercised?\" Or does it say that the four years \"shall be counted from the \ndate of the contract?\" Whence comes the authority to count the four years \"from \nthe expiration of the time within which the right to redeem could not be \nexercised,\" as something that \"should be allowed?\" Does article 1508 convey any \nsuch authority? If so, where? Is there anything which \"should be allowed\" except \nwhat the law allows? It seems to have the same fundamental misapprehension as \nappears in the question propounded in the same decision: \"In such case the \nquestion arises, Upon what basis must the duration of the right to repurchase be \ncalculated?\" What other basis can there be to calculate the \"duration of the \nright to repurchase\" <em>except the basis fixed by the law?<\/em> Why look a \nfield for a \"basis\" when the law puts it under the very nose ? The law says it \nis \"the date of the contract,\" as plainly as words can speak. The \"time within \nwhich the right to redeem could <em>not<\/em> be exercised\" has, as I view it, \nnothing to do with the application of the four-year period under article 1508. \nIt does not recognize any time or period during which the redemption can \n<em>not<\/em> be made; but the <em>precise contrary<\/em>; it recognizes only a \nperiod in which it <em>can<\/em> be made. I cannot see how one can be substituted \nfor the other when they are exact opposites. If the four years must be counted \nfrom the <em>date of the contract,<\/em> and the parties to the contract have \nfixed the<em> date,<\/em> and the court by solemn declaration has also fixed the \ndate, how, can it be conceived that the four years can be counted from a \ndifferent date?<\/p>\n<p>What I regard as the fallacy of the reasoning employed is demonstrated by the \nfollowing syllogism, both premises of which are actual findings of the court, \nand the conclusion precisely its conclusion;<\/p>\n<p>First premise: Article 1508 provides that the four years shall be \"counted \nfrom the date of the contract.\" <\/p>\n<p>Second premise: The \"date of the contract\" is March 30, 1903.<\/p>\n<p>The conclusion: Therefore, the four years must be counted from March 30, \n<em>1906.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As I have said before, no explanation is given for this. The mere declaration \nthat the four years shall be counted \"from the expiration of the time within \nwhich the right to redeem could not be exercised\" is, it seems to me, no \nexplanation. It merely accentuates the irremediable quality of the \nsyllogism.<\/p>\n<p>From these remarks it is clear, to my mind, that in this decision the court \nholds that the date of the contract is without significance in applying article \n1508 to a sale with a right to repurchase. Although in both of the cases under \ndiscussion, the one at bar and Rosales <em>vs.<\/em> Reyes and Ordoveza, the \ncourt found and fixed the date of the contract, it apparently held that date to \nbe of no importance in connection with the express wording of article 1508, \ndisregarded it, and proceeded to count the four years from a different date.<\/p>\n<p>Nor can it be urged in palliation or explanation of the apparent failure to \napply the law, after having expressly found all the grounds necessary for its \napplication, that it must be presumed that it was intended to hold that the date \nof the contract was fixed by the parties, impliedly at least, as of the time \nwhen the three-year suspension terminated; and that, the true date of the \ncontract being March 30, 1906, instead of 1903, the four years should be counted \nfrom that date. Such a suggestion cannot be accepted. The date of a contract is \nfixed by law in certain cases and for certain purposes and the parties cannot \nalter or change it. Manresa (vol. 10, p. 303) says that \"the phrase 'date of the \ncontract' must not always be taken literally. The date of the contract is the \ndate from which <em>that contract begins to produce its natural effects.\"<\/em> \nThat is, \"the date which fixes the moment of the consummation of the purchase, \nthe moment when the vendor is divested of his rights and receives the price that \nwas in such event stipulated.\" Scaevola (vol.23, pp. 769, 770) says:<\/p>\n<p>\"(A) <em>Computation of the periods.<\/em>\u2014In the solution of problems of \ncomputation, the essential datum is the starting point, and this the code \nfurnishes us with unsurpassable clearness. The right to recover the thing sold, \nwith the resultant obligations to restore and indemnify, lasts four years, or \nthe time agreed upon, provided it does not exceed ten years, <em>counted from \nthe date of the contract.<\/em> This definiteness with which the legislator has \nfixed the commencement of the period implicitly carries in itself the \ndetermination of a point discussed by jurists but which is no longer of moment. \nMay the condition of repurchase be stipulated through a consideration distinct \nfrom that of purchase and sale? We find the answer in article 1508: If, in \ncomputing the time, its commencement must necessarily run from the date of the \ncontract, and it is understood that that of sale is alluded to, then the \ncovenant of repurchase must be consubstantial with the contract, implying a \ncondition of the same, and both the conveyance and the condition subsequent are \ngoverned by one single consent. The subsequent agreement might be a new contract \nequivalent to a promise of sale, but it produces a personal, not a real, action; \nit does, not convert the original indefeasible contract into one revocable by \nits nature. Legal redemption is connascent with the contract of purchase and \nsale; they both came into juridical life in the same birth.\"<\/p>\n<p>While, as Manresa says, the contract may not be of the precise date which the \ninstrument actually bears, the real date can not be later than the time when the \ncontract actually takes effect, that is, the time when the parties obtain their \nrights and assume their obligations under it. Parties who, on a particular day, \naccepted the mutual benefits and assumed the mutual obligations of a contract \nbetween them, in other words, put the contract into operation, cannot be heard \nto say that that date was not the real date of the contract and that the true \ndate was three years thence. This is especially so in respect of contracts \nwhich, from the nature of the subject matter and form of the covenants, take on \na public aspect and as to which laws have been specially passed for the \nprotection of the public interests.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, the purpose of article 1508 being, as we have already shown, to \nprevent the contract dealt with therein from unsettling the title to the real \nestate which is the subject matter thereof for periods beyond those provided for \nin that section, no person will be permitted, on any sort of pretense, to \nproduce the result by said section sought to be avoided; and especially not by a \nmethod so wholly without foundation or merits as that of claiming that the true \ndate of a contract is not that on which the contract goes into full operation \nbut such date as the parties may be pleased to fix. When contracts operate, the \nlaw applicable to them operates. The proposition that persons may make and enjoy \nthe benefits of contracts and still prevent the law from operating upon them is \none that would, if adhered to, result disastrously. Notwithstanding, I fear that \nthe result of the decision in this case is to lay down precisely this \nproposition. The court says that, while the contract took effect and went into \nfull operation on the 30th of March, 1903, article 1508 of the Civil Code did \nnot begin to operate upon it till the 30th of March, <em>1906;<\/em> and why? \nSimply because, the court seems to say, <em>the parties agreed to suspend the \nlaw until that time.<\/em> This would seem to be erroneous when confronted with \nthe proposition that the law held to be suspended was one in the interests of \nthe public as well as the parties. May parties to contracts suspend laws of this \nnature?<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the contention that the parties suspended the contract, or its \ndate, fails, in my judgment, to perceive the distinction between the suspension \nof the <em>operation<\/em> of a contract and the suspension of the<em> law \n<\/em>which governs the contract. As I have already noted, parties to contracts, \nafter they are executed, may suspend their operation until such time as they \nplease. In such case they take no present benefits and incur no present \nobligations under the contract. No present rights or interests are transmitted. \nIt is executed and laid away and nothing is done under it till the<br\/>date to \nwhich its operation was suspended. This is a suspension of the \n<em>operation<\/em> of the contract, of the date, if you please. Such a procedure \nis recognized as legal. But nothing of this was done in the case before us. The \ncontract took effect at once. It is the <em>law<\/em> applicable thereto which \nwas suspended.<\/p>\n<p>As I have already intimated, the doctrine that the parties may, at will, \nsuspend the operation of the statute and thereby destroy the force and effect of \nthe four-year limitation, is fatal to the efficacy of the law governing sales \nwith right to repurchase. In effect, it repeals it. It is clear that, if the \nparties may suspend the law for three years, they may suspend it for ten years, \nor twenty years, or fifty years, or for any period that pleases them. This, of \ncourse, makes the law a farce and destroys its value completely.<\/p>\n<p>It appears that the court in the decisions under discussion foresaw, to some \nextent at least, the fatal results which would follow such a doctrine and \napparently sought to avoid, in part, the evil results thereof. To accomplish \nthis it brought into requisition the ten-year limitation found in the same \narticle of the code, and declared that, although the four-year period was \napplicable to the contract at its origin, the ten-year period also was \napplicable thereto; so that, although persons may suspend the operation of the \nfour-year limitation, they may not do so to such an extent that the period of \nsuspension added to the four years will exceed ten years. The germ of this \nstrange theory is found in this expression of the court:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In such a case the question arises: Upon what basis must the duration of the \nright to repurchase be calculated? Any such contract must necessarily be \nterminated ten years from the date of its execution, but should the vendor have \nthe privilege to exercise this right for the balance of the ten years, or should \nhe be allowed only four years on the ground that there was no express agreement \nof the parties upon this point? In all such cases it would seem that the vendor \nshould be allowed f6ur years from the expiration of the time within which the \nright to redeem could hot fee exercised, or in the event that four years would \nextend the life of the contract beyond ten years, the balance of the ten year \nperiod, on the ground that vendors, where the right to redeem is not thus \nsuspended and no express agreement as to the length of time during which it may \nbe exercised is made, are also allowed four years.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The error into which the court appears to me to have fallen in making- this \nsuggestion is plain. It is held by virtue of this suggestion, that the four-year \nperiod and the ten year period apply to the <em>same contract.<\/em> This appears \nto me to be an impossibility on its face, impossible by virtue of language \nitself. When it made the suggestion referred to the court was engaged in \ninterpreting a contract which, by its express holding, was such a contract in \nform and nature that the four-year period and not the ten-year period applied to \nit. That the four-year period was applicable the court expressly holds. This \nholding was arrived at by selecting between the four and the ten-year periods. \nThe very first thing the court had to do in interpreting the contract was to \ndetermine <em>which period<\/em> was applicable, the four or the ten. It held \nthat the four-year period was applicable. <em>That necessarily held that \nten-year period was not.<\/em> Where it is necessary to make a choice between two \nperiods of limitation, the selection of the one is <em>necessarily<\/em> the \nrejection of the other. Therefore, when the court made the suggestion that the \nten-year period was also applicable, <em>it had already held that it was not. \n<\/em>This, in itself, it seems to me, is a complete refutation of the \nsuggestion; or, perhaps better said, the suggestion is in complete contradiction \nof the previous action of the court when it held that the four and not the \nten-year period was applicable.<\/p>\n<p>If anything further were needed to show the fallacy of the proposition \ninvolved in this suggestion that both periods are applicable to the same \ncontract, the question might be put: What is the reason that the court decided \nthat the four year period was applicable instead of the ten-year \nperiod?<br\/><br\/>The answer to that question completely destroys the theory now \nunder discussion and shows how impossible it is to sustain it. Whether the \nfour-year period or the ten-year period applies to a given contract depends upon \nthe nature of that contract. The four-year period applies to a contract, not by \nvirtue of the time which it is to run, but by virtue of the nature thereof. The \ntest as to whether the four-year period applies is: Did the parties expressly \nstipulate in their contract a period within which the repurchase might be made? \nIf they did not, the four-year period is applicable. That is the decisive \nfeature which determines whether the four-year or the ten-year period is \napplicable. If the parties did expressly stipulate the time within which the \nrepurchase might be made, then the ten-year period applies. It is thus clear \nthat the conditions which determine in favor of the application of the four-year \nperiod are precisely the opposite of those which determine in favor of the \nten-year period. In other words, if the conditions are such that the four-year \nperiod is applicable, then they are such as to render it impossible that the \nten-year period be applicable; and we behold a condition in which it is utterly \nimpossible, legally or logically, <em>that both periods of limitation be \napplicable to the same contract.<\/em> In spite of this, however, it is contended \nby the decision that, although it is conceded that the parties did not expressly \nstipulate the time within which the repurchase might be made and that, \ntherefore, the four-year period was applicable, nevertheless, the ten-year \nperiod was also applicable. This is impossible in the face of the fact that the \ncourt at the threshold of the inquiry expressly held that the ten-year \nlimitation had no application; and the reasons given why the ten-year period had \nn6 application were the very reasons why the four-year limitation did apply. The \nonly reason given, so far as I can gather, for applying both periods to the same \ncontract is to prevent the first error, namely, permitting the parties to \nsuspend the operation of the four-year limitation, from destroying the efficacy \nof the law altogether. For, if the parties may suspend the operation of the law \nat will, then not only is the four-year restriction rendered worthless but the \nten-year limitation also. To avoid this result, the decision committed the other \nerror of applying both limitations to the same sale. But the error committed in \nsaying that 2 and 2 make 5 cannot be corrected by holding thereafter that 2 and \n3 make 4.<\/p>\n<p>Besides the error of applying to the same contract two periods of limitation \nwhich depend upon precisely opposite conditions, the court, in my humble \nopinion, has also committed the further error of confounding the nature 'of the \ntwo limitations. The four-year limitation is really a limitation. Where the \nparties say nothing about the time for redemption, then the law imposes a \nlimitation as to the time. On the other hand, the provision which contains the \nten-year limitation does not create a limitation on the contract, as does the \nfirst. It simply places a limitation upon the power of the parties as to their \nstipulations. It provides that they may not <em>contract<\/em> for a longer \nperiod of redemption than ten years. It is not, therefore, a statute of \nlimitations, nor does it have the significance, force or effect thereof. The \nten-year limitation prohibits an act. The four-year period limits the life of \nthe contract. The ten-year limitation applies to the acts of the parties. The \nfour-year limitation applies to the contract after it is executed. The one is a \nlimitation. The other is a prohibition. This distinction is not made in the \ndecision; and, taken together with the fact that the two periods of limitation \ndepend for their existence and limitation upon exactly opposite conditions, we \nsee clearly the error committed in applying both limitations to the same \ncontract. The statute had in mind the covering of two radically different \nconditions, one with a limitation and the other with a prohibition. The court, \nby its decision, destroyed the limitation and made the prohibition cover both \nconditions.<\/p>\n<p>That the decision has destroyed one limitation and made the other applicable \nto both conditions specified in the code is clear, for, if the parties may \nsuspend the operation of the four-year period for six years and then, in \naccordance with the holding of the court, may add the four-year period to that, \nthey have taken advantage of a ten-year period without fulfilling the conditions \nwhich the law requires before they have a right to do so. It has already been \nheld by this court that the limitations specified in article 1508 cannot be \nenlarged, as they refer to matters of public concern; and any method which \nextends these limitations, or either of them, beyond the periods named in the \nlaw trenches on the public welfare and destroys to that extent the value of the \nprovisions designed to preserve and protect it. Therefore, it is a matter of \npublic concern that the parties who refused to put in their contract the period \nduring which they desired the right of repurchase to continue, should be \nrestricted in such right to the period which the law names, namely, four years; \nwhereas, if the parties are willing to state the period during which the right \nof repurchase shall run, the law gives them the right to stipulate a more \ngenerous period, namely, ten years. In other words, the law, if we may so speak, \nplaces a premium upon the open and clear expression of the time by giving the \nparties a ten-year privilege as against the grant of only four years where the \nparties refuse to be clear and definite. It is the policy of the law to destroy \nuncertainties in contracts of this character, and where the uncertainty is the \ngreatest the law restricts the period most. Where the uncertainty is least, the \nlaw restricts the period less. The decision puts parties who do not expressly \nstipulate the period of redemption in exactly the same position as those who do \nstipulate, and gives them exactly the same privileges. In other words, under the \nholding of the court, the parties, although they have not expressly stipulated \nthe term of redemption in their contract, may, nevertheless, by the legerdemain \nof suspending the operation of the statutory period for repurchase, obtain \nexactly the same period for their contract as the parties to another contract \nwho have expressly stipulated the period. This wipes out the division or \nclassification made in the law, destroys the difference between the parties who \nact openly and those who do not, and gives the same privileges to both. <\/p>\n<p>There is another and fundamental reason why the decision of the court is \nerroneous; and that is that the suspension of the application of the four-year \nlimitation destroys the essential element and changes the distinctive character \nof the sale with a right to repurchase, as it is known to the Spanish law, and \nconverts the contract into one of mere loan on security. One of the essential \nrequisites of the contract of sale with <em>pacto de retro<\/em> is the right of \nthe vendor to repurchase when he will. The code itself speaks in no other way of \nthe period of repurchase than to declare that the repurchase may be made \n<em>within<\/em> the period specified. It is not like a promissory note or \nmortgage, under which the indebtedness therein mentioned or secured must be paid \non the date named. The contract under discussion provides always, and no other \ndescription of it is given by any statute or other, that the repurchase may be \nmade <em>within<\/em> a given time. This means, of course, that the <em>time \nwhen<\/em> the repurchase is made is left to the will of the vendor. He can \nrepurchase on any one of the days which constitute the period agreed upon or \nfixed by the statute.<\/p>\n<p>This theory corresponds perfectly with the history of the contract. It \noriginated, so far as its Spanish history is concerned, in the Province of \nCatalonia and was devised to assist landholders in cultivating their land. A \nlandholder, not having sufficient funds with which to properly cultivate his \nvarious parcels, would obtain a loan, selling, as security for the loan, one of \nthe parcels, reserving the right to repurchase the same. The time within which \nthe borrower could make the repurchase was generally not known. It depended \neither upon the time when he could sell the crop which he, perhaps at the time, \nhad in the warehouse, or upon the time when he could harvest and market the \ncrops for the cultivation and harvesting of which the money was borrowed. This \nbeing so, the precise time for repurchase could not, as a general rule, be \nfixed. The borrower could not say that he would repay it six months, or nine \nmonths, or a year from date, or at any other specific time. It depended on when \nthe crop was ripened and ready for harvest and when it could be marketed \nthereafter. These things were, in turn, dependent upon so many uncertainties \nthat it became the custom to leave the time during which the repurchase could be \nmade entirely to the will of the vendor. So thoroughly was this understood that \nthe contract in Catalonia was called a <em>venta a carta de gracias.<\/em> This \nspecial and distinctive feature was carried into the Civil Code and, as we have \nseen, it is provided that the right to repurchase shall continue \n(<em>durara<\/em>) for four years, during any one of the days constituting which \nthe repurchase can be made. Every author who treats the subject uses, with \nreference to the period of redemption, the word \"dentro,\" within, indicating \nthat the right may be exercised at any time <em>within <\/em>the period named. \nThe fact is that the right to repurchase at any moment is such an essential part \nof a sale with a right to repurchase that its existence is taken for granted by \nall the authors dealing with the subject. I have found none who directly discuss \nthe question; but all of them go upon assumptions which sustain the proposition \nI am presenting.<\/p>\n<p>If my contention be sustainable, then the purchaser, if he intends to create \na sale with right of repurchase, has no right to, prohibit the vendor from \nrepurchasing. Such a prohibition takes from the vendor a privilege which the law \nconfers upon him and makes use of it for the enrichment of the purchaser. It is \ngenerally stated by Spanish authors dealing with this subject that the purchaser \ncannot, by stipulation in the contract, <em>compel<\/em> the vendor to \nrepurchase; and that if such a stipulation is placed in the contract, it changes \nits essential nature and transforms it into a mere contract of loan on security, \nsomething in the nature of a pledge of real estate. Scaevola (vol. 23, p. 764) \nsays: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If the stipulation were such as to oblige the vendor to avail himself of his \nright of repurchase, the juridical institution or organism thus created would be \na different thing from a sale with a right of repurchase, the nature of which \ndoes not allow that a covenant introduced for the benefit of the vendor may be \nconverted into an instrument against him of which the purchaser may make \nexclusive use.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If this is true, and I regard the proposition stated by Scaevola as \nuniversally accepted, then why should not the same result follow where the \npurchaser <em>prohibits<\/em> the vendor from repurchasing for a given time? \nCertainly the prohibition against the repurchase is far more injurious to the \nvendor and beneficial to the purchaser than the requirement that he \n<em>must<\/em> repurchase. The obligation to repurchase is not necessarily a \nsevere one, whereas the prohibition against repurchase for six years, for \nexample, may be a very severe blow to the vendor's interests, Not only that, but \nit enables the lender to obtain by means of this contract, which the law \ndesigned primarily for the benefit of the vendor, not only all of the privileges \nwhich inure to him by virtue thereof, but also the additional advantage which \ninheres in a mortgage, or, a long period during which he may draw interest or \nhave complete possession and control of the property purchased.<\/p>\n<p>In this connection it must not be forgotten that, on the execution of a sale \nwith a right of repurchase, the purchaser has the right of immediate possession. \nNow, if he be permitted, by a stipulation in the contract, to prohibit the \nvendor from repurchasing for six years, then he not only obtains, the title to \nthe property itself as security for repayment, but he also deprives the vendor \nof the possession of his property for an extremely long period. This is one of1 \nthe precise things that the Civil Code sought to prevent. As a necessary \nconsequence, the decision of the court, that a sale with<br\/>a right of \nrepurchase is permissible which prohibits the vendor from repurchasing for six \nyears, appears to me to be in direct violation of the spirit which animated the \ncode, and results in delivering the borrower into the power of the lender, from \nwhose hands it was the intention and purpose of the Civil Code to rescue him. It \nis no reply to my argument to urge that the code permits the parties to \nstipulate a ten-year period, for, under such stipulation, the <em>vendor may \nrepurchase at any time he pleases during the ten years.<\/em><br\/><br\/>The decision \nsays: \"But if it were held that, regardless of such a provision, the redemption \nright expires within four years from the date of the contract unless there is a \nspecial provision as to how long this right, once effective, shall continue, \nmany other perfectly valid contracts can be conceived in which the redemption \nprivilege would be unenforceable. For instance, if the stipulation in question \nhad provided that the right to redeem should not be exercised within- five years \nfrom the date of the contract, it is quite apparent that, according to the \nargument adduced by the defendants, the vendor could not have redeemed the \nproperty at all, for the right to do so would have expired one year \npreviously.\"<\/p>\n<p>This portion of the decision merely assumes that a stipulation suspending the \napplication of the four-year period for five years is valid. This is \nunquestionably true; but it misses the whole question at issue when viewed from \nthe standpoint from which I am now discussing it. The point is, does such a \nstipulation destroy the nature of the relation between the parties; that is, \ndoes it destroy the contract <em>as a sale with a right of repurchase, and \ntransform ii into another and entirely different contract?<\/em> No one contends \nthat such a stipulation is invalid; the sole contention is that it is not a \nvalid, proper, or permissible stipulation <em>in a sale with a right to \nrepurchase<\/em> and that it destroys the essential nature of the contract and \ntransforms it into something entirely different. The proposition I am presenting \nis that such a stipulation converts the sale with right of repurchase, as the \nCode knows it, into a mere relation of borrower and lender, thereby destroying \ncompletely the relation of vendor and vendee; and that none of the provisions of \nthe Civil Code relating to such a sale are applicable. Such a stipulation may be \nvalid and its presence may not render the agreement void in the general sense; \nbut it does render the contract void <em>as a sale with right of \nrepurchase.<\/em> This is the point. The decision assumes that the parties, in a \ncontract of sale with a right of repurchase, may do whatever they please and the \ncontract still remains a sale with a right of repurchase. The contention that I \nam making is that such a contract is of a highly special nature, in many of its \naspects strictly statutory, and that, when certain of its elements are \ndestroyed, it ceases to be such a contract and becomes something different; that \nwhen such a contract provides that the vendor <em>must<\/em> repurchase, that \nstipulation changes the nature of the contract and transforms it into something \ndifferent, and that where it stipulates that the vendor shall <em>not<\/em> \nrepurchase, that stipulation also changes the nature of the contract and \nconverts it into a different species of relation. To repeat, then: A stipulation \nin a contract of sale with a right to repurchase that the vendor shall not \nrepurchase during a period of years is a stipulation in violation of the \nessential nature of the contract, which deprives the vendor of the protection \nwhich the statute gives him, which places him in the power of the lender from \nwhich it was the intention of the law to rescue him, and transforms and converts \nit into one of loan on security which is governed by principles wholly different \nfrom those that govern the sale with <em>pacto de retro.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/div>",

We are of opinion \nhowever that the trial judge properly disregarded their contentions in this \nrespect. Without examining the contentions of the plaintiff as to alleged \nfailure of defendants to plead the former adjudication in due form and as to the \nlack of complete identity of the subject matter in the present and the former \naction, it is a sufficient answer to the plea of <em>res adjudicata<\/em> to say \nthat the question of the right of the plaintiffs to the return of the money \nprayed for in their complaint was not and could not have been put in issue in \nthe former action. The true force and effect of the former adjudication is not \nto bar the claim of the plaintiff to recover the money paid out by them pending \nthe former proceedings, but rather to establish their right to recover upon \nproof of their allegations as to the fact of payment, and the circumstances \nunder which they were compelled to make such payment, in order to avoid \nunnecessary loss and injury flowing from the levy of execution which was held to \nhave been \"null, for the reason that the court was without jurisdiction to issue \nthe same,\" We conclude therefore that the trial judge correctly disposed of the \nprincipal question at issue in the court below.\n<p>We think however that plaintiff's appeal from his ruling denying interest on \nthe moneys paid out by them is well taken. As counsel well says, had the \nappellant, whose land was actually sold under a, wrongful execution in this \ncase, been deprived of the use of the land by reason of said sale, there can be \nno doubt of its right to recover, as damages for the wrong, compensation for the \nloss of the use of the land. Instead of standing idly by and suffering the \nunnecessary infliction of such damage, the appellant avoided the loss of the use \nof its land, by depositing in its place, under due protest, its established \nequivalent in money. In other words, the appellant, being threatened with the \nwrongful deprivation of the use of its land, took the necessary steps to avoid \nsuch deprivation, and underwent, instead, the deprivation of the use of an \nequivalent sum of money. This was done in pursuance of the obligation which \nrests upon every member of the community who is the victim of a tort, to do all \nwithin his power to diminish the resultant damage. It was an act done for the \nbenefit of the tort feasor, who thereby became liable to compensate for the lost \nuse of the money, instead of the lost use of the land. It goes without saying, \nof course, that no such act could be done to the prejudice of the tort feasor, \nin increase of the resultant damages, and if it had been shown that the use of \nthe money was of greater value than the use of the land, the liability of the \ntort feasor would be limited to compensation for the lesser sum. But no such \ncontention is here made, and no such question is involved. The appellant \nsubstituted money, in place of land, and suffered the loss of use of the former \ninstead of loss of use of the latter. By the amount of the loss of said use the \nappellant has been damaged and is entitled to compensation.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the lower court should therefore be modified by allowing, in \naddition to the amount awarded to the plaintiff therein, interest at the rate of \n6 per cent per annum on the money turned over to the sheriff.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Besides, other devices used in smoking opium were found in the room, and, \nin the hands of the accused, 8 grams of opium and 4 grams of opium \nashes.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The only defense presented by the defendant was in the nature of a general \ndenial of all of the facts stated by the witnesses for the prosecution.<\/p>\n<p>During the trial of the cause the prosecution presented Exhibit B. (Record, \npage 6.) Said exhibit is a certificate presented by the police department of the \ncity of Manila. It certifies that the defendant had been condemned for a \nviolation of the Opium Law in two different causes, by the Court of First \nInstance of the city of Manila. The first was cause No. 7779, for a period of \nthree months' imprisonment and the second was cause No. 9253, for a period of \nfour months' imprisonment. Said certificate was presented and admitted in \nevidence without objection in the lower court. From the sentence of the lower \ncourt the defendant appealed to this court.<\/p>\n<p>The only objection presented by the appellant in this court relates to the \npenalty1 of six months' imprisonment imposed by the lower court, based upon the \nfact that the defendant had been convicted before for the same offense. The \nappellant argues that Exhibit B should not have been admitted in the lower \ncourt. He insists that it is not sufficient proof of the fact that he had been \ntheretofore convicted of a similar offense. It will be remembered that the \ndefendant, even though he was represented by an attorney at law in the trial of \nthe cause, made no objection to the admissibility of said Exhibit B. His \nobjection to the admissibility of said exhibit is presented for the first time \nin this court. We do not understand why the prosecuting attorney did not present \nthe records of the Court of First Instance, for the purpose of showing that the \ndefendant had been theretofore convicted of similar offenses. The records \ncertainly would have been the best proof of such former conviction. The \ncertificate was not the best proof. There seems to be no justification for the \npresentation of proof of a secondary character, when the case was being tried in \nthe same court where the defendant had been theretofore twice convicted and \nwhere the original records were. Under an objection upon the ground that the \nsaid certificate (Exhibit B) was not the best proof, it should have been \nrejected. Once admitted, however, without objection, even though not the best \nevidence, and even though not admissible under an objection, we are not inclined \nnow to reject it. If the defendant had opportunely presented an objection to the \nadmissibility of said certificate, no doubt the prosecution would have presented \nthe best proof upon the questions to which said certificate relates. If the \ndefendant did not believe that the proof was sufficient, he should have \npresented his objection at the time the same was presented, and thereby have \ngiven the prosecuting attorney an opportunity, if he desired to prove the fact, \nto present other and different proof. Evidently the defendant did not object to \nthe admissibility of said certificate, because he was willing to admit the facts \ncontained therein. The complaint alleged that the defendant had been convicted \ntwice before of a violation of the same law (the Opium Law). That allegation was \nevidently made for the purpose of increasing the penalty in the present case. \nThe burden was upon the the prosecution to prove said allegation. The \nprosecuting attorney evidently believed that he had made out a prima facie case \nby the presentation of said certificate. Had the defendant objected to its \nadmissibility, the prosecuting attorney would have presented the record of the \ncourt in support of his allegation. The defendant made no objection to the \nadmissibility of the proof offered, neither did he attempt to refute the prima \nfacie case made by the prosecuting attorney. Objections which are relied upon \nfor the purpose of reversing or modifying the decisions of the trial court, \nshould be made first in that court.<\/p>\n<p>In view of all of the facts in the present case and the failure of the \ndefendant to object to the admissibility of said Exhibit B, while we admit that \nsaid exhibit is not the best proof of the facts which the prosecuting attorney \nwas attempting to prove, yet, nevertheless, we are not inclined to reverse or \nmodify the sentence of the lower court. Therefore the sentence of the lower \ncourt is hereby affirmed, with costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Before the issuance of the final \ndecree directing the registration of this land in favor of the applicant, the \nofficial surveyor of the icourt reported that the original plan submitted by the \napplicant was defective, in that it had not been approved by the Director of \nLands. Thereafter an order was issued directing the applicant to present a new \nplan, whereupon the applicant prayed that under the provisions of section 66 of \nAct No. 926 the Bureau of Lands be directed to make a new survey at the expense \nof the Insular Government. This is an appeal by the Director of Lands on behalf \nof the Government of the Philippine Islands from an order of the court granting \nthe prayer of the applicant and directing that the tract be surveyed at the cost \nof the Insular Government.\n<p>Section 66 of Act No. 926 is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Whenever any judgment of confirmation or other decree of the court involving \npublic lands shall become final, the clerk of the court shall certify that fact \nto the Bureau of Public Lands, with a copy of the decree of confirmation or \njudgment of the court, which shall plainly state the location, boundaries, and \narea as nearly as may be, of the tract involved in the decree or judgment, and \nshall be accompanied by a plan of the land as confirmed or acted upon by the \ncourt. In the event the original survey was made by the Bureau of Public Lands \nand the decree of the court conforms thereto, no further proceedings shall be \nrequired. When the original survey was made by the applicant or where the tract \nconfirmed by the court varies from the original survey as made by the Bureau of \nPublic Lands, the Chief of the Bureau of Public Lands shall immediately cause \nthe tract, so confirmed by the court, to be surveyed at the cost of the Insular \nGovernment, and shall, when such survey has been approved by him, furnish a copy \nof same to the Court of Land Registration and to the applicant, which survey \nwhen approved by the court, and unless objected to by the applicant within \nthirty days, shall be conclusively presumed to be correct. If objection is made \nto the survey by the applicant, the court, upon notice to the Bureau of Public \nLands, shall hear such objections., and its action in the matter shall be \nfinal.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The judge of the Court of Land Registration was of opinion that in any case \nwherein the facts disclosed by the proceedings had upon an application for \nadjudication of title and registration under the Land Registration Act disclosed \nthat the applicant would be entitled to a certificate of title under the \nprovisions of subsection 6 of section 54 of Act No. 926 as amended, such \napplicant is further entitled to have his land surveyed at the cost of the \nInsular Government under the provisions of section 66. The contention seems to \nbe that since section 66 and section 54 are both contained in Chapter VI of the \nAct, which treats of \"unperfected titles and Spanish grants and concessions,\" \nthe provisions of section Q6 must be held to be applicable to all of the cases \nmentioned in section 54, by virtue of which occupants of public lands in the \nPhilippine Islands claiming under \"unperfected titles and Spanish grants and \nconcessions\" may have their claims confirmed and secure the issuance of a \ncertificate of title therefor.<\/p>\n<p>Subsection 6 of section 54 is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"All persons who by themselves or their predecessors in interest have been in \nthe open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of \nagricultural public lands, as defined by said Act of Congress of July first, \nnineteen hundred and two, under a bona fide claim of ownership except as against \nthe Government, for a period of ten years next preceding the taking effect of \nthis Act, except when prevented by war or <em>force majeure,<\/em> shall be \nconclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a \nGovernment grant and to have received the same, and shall be entitled to a \ncertificate of title to such land under the provisions of this \nchapter.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Unlike the other cases dealt with in that section, the provisions of \nsubsection 6 manifestly contemplate the registration of lands which are \nconclusively presumed to have long ceased to be public lands as a result of a \npresumed Government grant and the performance of all the conditions essential \nthereto, including the acceptance of the grant. Before a court can adjudicate \ntitle in favor of an applicant under the provisions of subsection 6 of section \n54, proof must be submitted sufficient under the provisions of that section to \nsustain a finding that the applicant had received a Government grant of the \nlands in question more than ten years prior to the date of the enactment of the \nAct (October 7,1903), and that since that time the lands had ceased to be a part \nof the public domain. Manifestly a \"judgment of confirmation or other decree of \nthe court\" adjudicating title under the provisions of the above cited subsection \n6 of section 54 does not in any proper sense involve \"public lands\" as that term \nis used in section 66 of the Act. The provisions of this section clearly refer \nto cases wherein a final judgment of confirmation or other decree of the court \nis entered which has the effect of adjudicating title or decreeing the \nregistration of lands in favor of private individuals which prior thereto \nconstituted a part of the public domain, as might well occur under the \nprovisions of subsections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of section 54, where claimants to \npublic lands seek to have title thereto adjudicated in their favor although the \ntitle had not theretofore passed from the Government to the claimant. The words \n\"public lands\" as used in this section are not intended to include all lands \nwhich may at any time have been a part of the public domain, though long since \nsevered therefrom. They refer rather to lands the title to which continues to be \nin the United States up to the time of the entry of the final \"judgment of \nconfirmation or decree\" involving them, to which reference is made in the \nopening sentence of this section.<\/p>\n<p>We are confirmed in our construction of the provisions of these sections by \nthe consideration that if the contention of the appellee were sustained, the \nburden would be placed upon the Insular Government of surveying at its cost all, \nor nearly all, lands registered under the provisions of the Land Registration \nAct to which the applicants or their predecessors in interest claimed ownership \nprior to the transfer of sovereignty of these Islands to the Government of the \nUnited States. We do not think that if it was the intention of the lawmaker to \nimpose such a burden upon the Insular Government the language used would have \nbeen so uncertain as to require the court to rely upon strained and uncertain \ninferences in giving its proper effect.<\/p>\n<p>The order appealed from should be and is hereby reversed, without costs to \neither party.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The complaint \nalleged:\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That on or about the morning of December 27, 1912, in the jurisdiction Of \nthis municipality of Iloilo, Province of Iloilo, P. I., the said accused did \ntake and receive from Eusebio L. Garcia the sum of P300 as a deposit and under \nthe express condition of returning it on the day he might need it; but upon \nbeing required to retdrn it the said accused did not do so and refused to return \nit, and did willfully, maliciously and criminally and with intent to gain and to \ndefraud, appropriate to himself the said sum for his own use and benefit, to the \nprejudice of the economic interests of the said Eusebio L. Garcia; an act \nperformed in violation of the law.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Upon said complaint, the defendant was duly arrested, arraigned, tried, found \nguilty, and sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of six months of arresto \nmayor and to pay to Eusebio L. Garcia the sum of P250, in case of insolvency to \nsuffer subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay the costs.<\/p>\n<p>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable James S. Powell, judge, made the \nfollowing finding of facts:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The facts in this case show conclusively that on the morning of the 27th of \nDecember, 1912, E. L. Garcia and this defendant were stopping at the same hotel \nhere in Iloilo, They were both from the same town in Negros. Garcia was going \ninto the interior to one of the towns where he had a brother living and did not \nwant to carry so much money on his person, having P375, so. he gave to this \ndefendant P300 to keep.for him until his return. This was about 7.30 a. m. \nDecember 27, 1912. During the morning Garcia found that his brother was in \nIloilo and he did not go to the interior town to visit him, so at noon he was \nagain at the hotel and met this defendant and asked him for his money. He told \nhim that he would pay him during the afternoon and again that night Garcia was \nput off, and so for weeks. Garcia had left Negros and took up his residence in \nIloilo; he followed him back to Negros, tried to get the money but succeeded \nonly in getting P5O. That this sum was left as a deposit with this man is shown \nby his own written receipt (Exhibit A) to Garcia and the correspondence that \nthey had about it, as appears in the record, and, it all shows that it was \ntreated as a deposit throughout, from the time he gave the receipt for the \ndeposit of P300 on the 27th of December, up to the date of the filing of the \ncomplaint.<\/p>\n<p>\"This defendant attempted to show that it was a loan, notwithstanding his own \nwritten receipt, and told a most unbelievable story and a most tangled one, \nconvicting himself at every answer that he made. There is not the slightest \ndoubt of the defendant's guilt.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From the sentence of the lower court the defendant appealed. In this court \nthe only errors assigned by the appellant are ;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"First, that the court sustained the objection of the prosecution to the \nfollowing question, addressed by defendant's counsel to the witness Garcia: 'Why \ndid you not go to the bank or to somebody else to deposit this money ?'<\/p>\n<p>\"Second, that the trial court sustained the objection of the prosecution to \nthe following question addressed by counsel of the defendant to the witness \nGarcia: 'Why did you not take that money along with you ?'<\/p>\n<p>\"Third, that the trial court found the defendant guilty.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In support of, the first and second assignments of error, counsel for the \nappellant said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"During the cross-examination by defendant's counsel of the complaining \nwitness, the court sustained the objections of the prosecuting attorney to two \nquestions, as set out in the first and second assignments of error, as appears \nat folio 22 of the record. It is submitted that these rulings unjustifiably \nrestricted defendant's right to cross-examine. That the error was prejudicial to \ndefendant will, I believe, appear from reading the testimony, as will be urged \nunder the third assignment of error. As the prosecution's story of the deposit \nand the facts immediately succeeding it are somewhat remarkable, the defendant \nshould have been allowed to<br\/>cross-examine, fully as to the \ncircumstances.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>With reference to the first and second assignments of error above noted, we \nfind on page 32 of the record brought to this court, the following \nquestions:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\" (<em>a<\/em>) Why did you not go to the bank or to somebody else to deposit \nthis money?<\/p>\n<p>\" (<em>b<\/em>) Why did you not take that money along with \nyou?\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To each of these questions, the prosecuting attorney presented the following \nobjection.<\/p>\n<p>To the first: \"I object because he has explained why he did not go to the \nbank.\" And to the second: \"I object because the witness has already explained \nthat.\"<\/p>\n<p>If it is true that the prosecuting witness had explained why he did not go \nthe bank and deposit the money and why he did not take the money along with him, \nthen the defendant cannot complain if the court refused him the right to have \nsaid questions answered again.<\/p>\n<p>It appears from the record that the prosecuting, witness (Garcia) and the \ndefendant had been in the pueblo of Hog in the Province of Occidental Negros \nprior to the 26th day of December, 1912; that the former had been acting as \nmunicipal treasurer there and that the defendant had been there for some time \nacting as his clerk; that they together arrived at the city of Iloilo on the \n26th day of December, 1912, and both stopped at the Hotel Estrella and lived in \nthe same room; that on the 27th of December, the prosecuting witness intended to \ngo into the country for the purpose of visiting his brother and to start very \nearly in the morning; that the prosecuting witness had with him the sum of ^375; \nthat he discovered that his brother was not in the country and for that reason \nhe did not leave the city of Iloilo; that the prosecuting witness did leave the \nhotel early in the morning of the 27th and did not return until the middle of \nthe day.<\/p>\n<p>The prosecuting witness swore that he did not think it was safe to carry all \nof his money to the country and for that reason he gave to the defendant, early \nin the morning of the 27th, P300 to keep until his return. In the \ncross-examination of the prosecuting witness, the attorney for the defendant, in \nhis endeavor to find out why he had given the money to the defendant, asked: \n<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And what did you say before giving the money to him?\" And the prosecuting \nwitness answered: \"I was in doubt as to whether I should carry that money along \nwith me and I requested him (the accused) whether I could leave this money with \nhim as a deposit and get it back on my return.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>During the direct examination by the prosecuting attorney, in answer to the \nquestion: \"Why did you give it to him?\" (the accused), the prosecuting witness \nsaid: \"For security, because on that morning I had to leave for an interior \ntown; I left it with him for safe-keeping.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the foregoing questions and answers it appears why the prosecuting witness \nleft the money with the defendant. The prosecuting witness, while he explains \nthat the \"defendant had some immoral practices that Were not altogether in \naccordance with his notions, yet, at the same time, he had treated him with \nconfidence and had been treating him with confidence for some time before the \nmorning of the 27th of December.<\/p>\n<p>The appellant argues that there were other means of safe keeping for his \nmoney besides depositing it with the defendant. That is true; but the mere fact \nthat the prosecuting witness might have deposited his money in the bank or with \nsomebody else, does not in any way show that the defendant is not guilty of the \ncrime with which he is charged when it is proven that the money was deposited \nwith him for safekeeping under a promise to return the same upon request.<\/p>\n<p>While the lower court might have permitted the prosecuting witness to answer \nthe two questions above indicated, yet, in view of the fact that the witness had \nalready given his reasons for depositing the money with the defendant, we are of \nthe opinion that no prejudicial error was committed in this ruling.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the third assignment of error, to wit, that the trial court \nfound the defendant guilty of the crime charged, it may be said that the record \nshows that the prosecuting witness, Garcia, on the morning of the 27th of \nDecember, 1912, deposited, for safe-keeping with the defendant, the sum of P300, \nupon a promise to return the same upon request. At the time the money was \ndelivered to the defendant, one Telesforo Gargantiel was in the room with the \ndefendant and the prosecuting witness. It appears that Gargantiel went to the \nroom of the prosecuting witness and the defendant early, about 7.15 in the \nmorning, for the purpose of taking the prosecuting witness for a ride and that \nit was at that time the money was delivered to the defendant.<\/p>\n<p>Gargantiel also gives the reason that was given at the time why the \nprosecuting witness gave the money to the defendant. This witness gave the \nfollowing as the reason:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"At the time I came, Eusebio (the prosecuting witness) was preparing to go to \nGuimbal. A short time after he pulled out his pocketbook and said: 'I think it \nis dangerous to carry this money along with me.' Then he asked Vasquez as a \nfavor to him to keep that money as a deposit as he had to go to Guimbal on a \nshort trip to see his family. The first time Jose Vasquez did not accede to \nGarcia's request but the second time he did, saying: 'All right; when you come \nback from your trip you ask me and I will deliver it to you.'\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This witness swore that he saw the prosecuting witness deliver to the \ndefendant the sum of P300. The money was delivered to the defendant in the \nmorning. Some time after the middle of the day, the prosecuting witness returned \nto the hotel and requested that the money be returned to him. The defendant \npromised to deliver it to him in the afternoon or evening; whereupon the \nprosecuting witness insisted that the defendant should give him some evidence of \nthe deposit and the defendant then and there executed Exhibit A, which reads as \nfollows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Deposited in my possession the sum of three hundred pesos (P300) of Mr. \nEusebio L. Garcia, to whom I promise to deliver said sum when he so requests of \nme. ,<\/p>\n<p>\"Signed in Iloilo, Iloilo Province, this twenty-seventh day of December of \nnineteen hundred and twelve, A. D.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p align=\"right\">(Sgd.) \"JOSE B. VASQUEZ.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Witness:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Sgd.) \"F. P. RAMOS.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>\n<p>The fact that the defendant received from the prosecuting witness the sum of \nP300, on promise to return the same, is also evidenced by the fact that he later \npaid to the prosecuting witness the sum of P50, as well as by the fact that he \nrecognized his obligation on several occasions.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant attempted to show, while he admitted that he executed the \ndocument above referred to, showing that he had received on deposit the sum of \nP300 from the prosecuting witness; that it was not for money actually received \non that date, but as evidence simply of an existing indebtedness in favor of the \nprosecuting witness. The prosecuting witness swore positively that the defendant \nwas not indebted to him in any amount whatever. With reference to the alleged \nindebtedness of the defendant to the prosecuting witness, we find that the \nstatement of the lower court, after examining his testimony, is fully sustained. \nThe lower court said that the defendant \"told a most unbelievable story and a \nmost tangled one, convicting himself at every answer that he made.\"<\/p>\n<p>After a careful examination of the record brought to this court, we find no \nescape from the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged. \nThe sentence of the lower court is, therefore, hereby affirmed, with costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Execution was \nissued on April 18, 1910, upon the two parcels of land above stated, when they \nwere already inscribed in the property registry in the name of Isaac Borcelis. \nTheir sale at public auction was advertised for the following 27th of May and \nBorcelis on the 20th of the same month interposed as intervenes claiming that \nsaid lands were his and objecting to their sale; but the execution creditor \nGolingco furnished an execution bond by means of his bondsmen Severino Bon and \nTomas Burce, so the deputy of the sheriff Domingo Samson, named Alejandro \nBrusola, carried out the sale at public auction on May 27, 1910, the highest \nbidder for the two parcels being the execution creditor himself, Vicente \nGolingco.<\/p>\n<p>Hence the present complaint of Isaac Borcelis against the execution creditor \nVicente Golingco, the sheriff Domingo Samson, his deputy Alejandro Brusola, and \nthe bondsmen of the execution creditor for the sheriff, Severino Bon and Tomas \nBurce, wherein it is prayed: (1) That the sale of the two parcels of land \ndescribed in the complaint be declared null and void; (2) that the plaintiff's \nownership thereto be declared and that consequently restitution of possession of \nsaid parcels to him be ordered; and (3) that a finding as to indemnity for \ndamages be made in plaintiff's favor for the sum of P1,000 and that the bondsmen \nSeverino Bon and Tomas Burce be sentenced jointly and severally to pay same.<\/p>\n<p>After trial, the Court of First Instance of Albay rendered judgment in favor \nof the plaintiff Isaac Borcelis to the effect that he recover the lands \ndescribed in the amended complaint, as they now appear described in the judgment \nitself, and decreed that said plaintiff recover from the defendant Vicente \nGolingco and his two bondsmen Severino Bon and Tomas Burce the sum of P55, \nPhilippine currency, as indemnity and costs incurred by reason of this action. \nThe complaint with respect to the sheriff and his deputy was dismissed.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant Golingco appealed, his being the only appeal pending here.<\/p>\n<p>It is alleged that the trial court erred: (1) In deciding that Golingco did \nnot have a legal mortgage; (2) in deciding that when Isaac Borcelis bought the \nlands in question, whether for himself or another, he did not buy them with the \nincumbrance of the mortgage; (3) in deciding that when the lands were sold the \nsecond time to satisfy Golingco's judgment they did not belong to Pedro \nFloriano, the debtor.<\/p>\n<p>The first error assigned has no existence, for it is certain that Golingco \ndid not have a legal mortgage on the two parcels under consideration. The \ndocument executed by Pedro Floriano is a purely private one, drawn up in a \nnative dialect, and says nothing more than the following: \"That for his security \nfor the said sum I have given a guaranty of three documents for all the abaca, \ntwo in my name and the other from my father Mariano Floriano, and they are \nlocated in the place called Tagbacong of the jurisdiction of Tabaco, etc.\" \nMerely documents, and not lands, were given as security, nor does it appear in \nthe instrument of debt what were the pieces of realty to which the mortgage \ndocuments referred; but more decisively, with reference to the mortgage, in \naddition to the requisites required in article 1857 of the Civil Code, it is \nindispensable \"in order that the mortgage be validly constituted\" that the \ndocument constituting it be inscribed in the property registry (Civil Code, art. \n1875) ; and the document that Golingco calls a mortgage is not inscribed in the \nproperty registry, nor can it be, because it is a private one.<\/p>\n<p>Neither has the second error assigned any existence, because Isaac Borcelis \ndid not purchase the lands in question with the incumbrance of the mortgage \nclaimed, for it did not exist and no incumbrance on his inscribed title was \nrecorded.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, the third error assigned has no existence, because it is in \nevery way plain and evident that when on May 27,1910, the two parcels of land in \nquestion were sold at public auction by the execution of Golingco's judgment, \nthey no longer belonged to Pedro Floriano, but to Isaac Borcelis, as they had \nfrom December 24, 1908, although pending subject to possible legal redemption \nwhich expired on the same date in 1909, it left standing a final and absolute \ntitle of purchase and sale of the lands acquired at public auction, which \neffectively transferred the ownership and property rights in the thing \npurchased. <\/p>\n<p>The sale made by the sheriff to Vicente Golingco is annulled and the judgment \nappealed from is affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the \nappellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> \nconcur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

ROSARIO MEDIAVILLO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">It appears from the record that some time prior to the 17th day of September, \n1910, the last will and testament of Florencio Pecson was presented to the Court \nof First Instance of the Province of Albay for probate, Mr. Tomas Lorayes, an \nattorney at law, opposed the legalization of the will on the ground that it had \nnot been authorized nor signed by the deceased, in accordance with the \nprovisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. After hearing the respective parties, \nthe Honorable Percy M. Moir, judge, found that the will had been signed and \nexecuted in accordance with the provisions of law, and denied the opposition on \nthe 17th day of September, 1910.\n<p>On the 18th day of September, 1910, the said Tomas Lorayes, representing \nBasiliso Mediavillo and Rosario Mediavillo, presented a motion in the words \nfollowing:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"1. That Rosario Mediavillo is and Joaquin Mediavillo was a legitimate child \nof the deceased Teresa Pecson, who also was a daughter of the testator, \nFlorencio Pecson, and therefore the first mentioned is and the second was a \ngrandchild of the latter.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. That the said granddaughter, Rosario Mediavillo y Pecson, was \ndisinherited by her grandfather, the testator Florencio Pecson, according to \nclause 3 of the will, because she failed to show him due respect and on a \ncertain occasion raised her hand against him.<\/p>\n<p>\"3. That the interested party did not commit such an act, and if perhaps she \ndid, it was due to the derangement of her mental faculties which occurred a long \ntime ago and from which she now suffers in periodical attacks.<\/p>\n<p>\"By reason of all the foregoing and because the disinheriting clause 3 of the \nwill is unfounded, the undersigned prays the court to annul the said clause and \nto make the testator's grandchildren, Rosario and Joaquin Mediavillo (the latter \ndied without succession, but is represented now by his father, Basiliso \nMediavillo), participants in the estate left by their grandfather; and, finally, \nthat the court grant such other relief as it may deem just and \nequitable.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>After a consideration of the question presented by said motion, the lower \ncourt, on the 22d day of September, 1911, rendered the following decision:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This case has come up today for a hearing on the declaration of heirs of the \ndeceased Florencio Pecson, who died in Daraga, about the year 1910.<\/p>\n<p>\"From the evidence it appears that the deceased had eight children by his \nwife Nicolasa Manjares, likewise deceased, which children are those named \nEmerenciano, Teresa, Filomena, Asuncion, Rufino, Zoila, Emiliano, and Perfecto, \nall surnamed Pecson. It also appears that Rufino Pecson absented himself from \nthese Islands twenty-five years ago, going to Australia, and that nothing has \nbeen heard of him for the past twenty years. The said Rufino Pecson left no \nchildren in the Philippines and was unmarried when he emigrated. As nothing has \nbeen heard of him for twenty years, it is presumed that he died and it is held \nthat the part of this estate to which he was entitled must be divided among the \nother heirs.<\/p>\n<p>\"It also appears from the evidence that Teresa Pecson married Basiliso \nMediavillo', by whom she had two children, Joaquin and Rosario Mediavillo. \nTeresa also died, leaving these two children and her husband, Basiliso \nMediavillo. Her son Joaquin died, unmarried and childless, before the death of \nthe testator, Florencio Pecson. Rosario is the only living daughter of Teresa \nand the latter's husband, Basiliso Mediavillo, is also living. The evidence \nshows that this girl Rosario became insane in 1895, when she went to Nueva \nCaceres to study in college, and it has been proved that it was previous to this \ndate that she disobeyed her grandfather and raised her hand against him, and, as \nthe testator states in the third paragraph of his will, he disinherited her. \nThis court understands that this Rosario, who was then 14 years of age, and who \nshortly afterwards became insane, was not responsible for her acts and should \nnot have been disinherited by her grandfather.<\/p>\n<p>\"The court therefore decrees that this part of the will is contrary to law \nand sets it aside as being of no force or value whatever. The court further \nholds that Rosario Mediavillo, the daughter of Teresa Pecson, is the heiress of \nthe one-half of the share of this estate pertaining to the said Teresa, and that \nher father, as the heir of his son Joaquin, also. Teresa's son, is the heir of \nthe other one-half of the said share pertaining to Teresa\u2014that is, of the \none-seventh of this estate that pertains to the latter. Moreover, the court \ndecrees that, besides the two heirs just above mentioned, Emerciano, Filomena, \nAsuncion, Zoila, Emiliano, and Perfecto, surnamed Pecson, and the children of \nTeresa, are also heirs of the estate of Florencio Pecson.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From that decision the plaintiff appealed to this court and made the \nfollowing assignments of error:<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">\"FIRST ERROR.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The lower court erred in finding' that the part of the will which \ndisinherits Rosario Mediavillo is contrary to law, and in setting it aside as \nbeing of no force or value whatever.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p align=\"center\">\"SECOND ERROR.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The lower court erred by decreeing that Basiliso Mediavillo, the father of \nJoaquin Mediavillo, is the heir by representation of the one-half of the \none-seventh of this estate pertaining to Joaquin Mediavillo.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>With reference to the first assignment of error it may be said that from the \nrecord it appears that during the lifetime of Florencio Pecson he had been \nmarried to Nicolasa Manjares, with whom he had eight children, named Filomena, \nAsuncion, Zoila, Emerenciano, Emiliano, Perfecto, Rufino and Teresa Pecson; that \nbefore the death of Florencio Pecson he executed and delivered the will in \nquestion. The will made no provision for the said Rufino Pecson, neither was \nthere any provision in the will for the said Teresa. All of the other children \nwere named as heirs in said will. It appears that Teresa had been married with \none Basiliso Mediavillo, and that some time before the making of the will in \nquestion she died, leaving her husband and two children, Joaquin Mediavillo and \nRosario Mediavillo, as her heirs. It also appears from the record that Joaquin \nMediavillo died without heirs, leaving as the only heirs of the said Teresa \nPecson, her husband, Basiliso Mediavillo and the said Rosario Mediavillo. The \nsaid Joaquin Mediavillo died before his grandfather, Florencio Pecson, and \nprobably before the will in question was made.<\/p>\n<p>Paragraph 3 of the will disinherited Rosario Mediavillo in the following \nlanguage:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I declare that one of my daughters, named Teresa, now deceased, left a \nlegitimate daughter named Rosario Mediavillo. I also declare that I disinherit \nmy granddaughter, the said Rosario Mediavillo, because she was grossly \ndisrespectful to me and because on one occasion, when it was I do not remember, \nshe raised her hand against me. Therefore, it is my will that the said Rosario \nMediavillo shall have no share in my property.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The defendant, Rosario Mediavillo, in the motion which she presented and \nwhich is copied above, alleges that she was disinherited without cause, Upon a \nconsideration of that question, the lower court found that she had been \ndisinherited without cause and annulled said paragraph 3 of the will. That order \nof the lower court constitutes the error complained of by the appellant in her \nfirst assignment of error.<\/p>\n<p>By reference to said paragraph 3 above quoted, it will be seen that Florencio \nPecson disinherited the said Rosario Mediavillo \"because she was grossly \ndisrespectful to me and because on one occasion, when it was I do not remember, \nshe raised her hand against me. Therefore it is my will that she, the said \nRosario Mediavillo, shall have no share in my property.\"<\/p>\n<p>The lower court admitted proof upon the question of the responsibility of the \nsaid Rosario Mediavillo at the time she offered the offense to her grandfather, \nFlorencio Pecson. After hearing the proof, the lower court reached the following \nconclusion:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The evidence shows that this girl Rosario became insane in 1895, when she \nwent to Nueva Caceres to study in college, and it has been proved that it was \nprevious to this date that she disobeyed her grandfather and raised her hand \nagainst him, and, as the testator states in the third paragraph of his will, he \ndisinherited her. This court understands that this Rosario, who was then 14 \nyears of age, and who shortly afterwards became insane, was not responsible for \nher acts and should not have been disinherited by her \ngrandfather.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The first assignment of error presents the question whether or not the \ncourts, when a parent disinherits his children, may inquire into the cause of \nthe disinheritance and decide that there was or was not ground for such \ndisinheritance. The Civil Code (art. 848) provides that disinheritance shall \n<em>only <\/em>take place for one of the causes expressly fixed by law. In \naccordance with the provisions of that article (848) we find that articles 756 \nand 853 provide the cases or causes for disinheritance; or, in other words, the \ncases or causes. in which the ancestors may by will disinherit their heirs. \nArticle 849 of the Civil Code provides that the disinheritance can <em>only<\/em> \nbe effected by the testament, in which shall be mentioned the legal grounds or \ncauses for such disinheritance. If it is true that heirs can be disinherited \n<em>only<\/em> by will, and for causes mentioned in the Civil Code, it would seem \nto follow that the courts might properly inquire whether the disinheritance has \nbeen made properly and for the causes provided for by law. The right of the \ncourts to inquire into the causes and whether there was sufficient cause for the \ndisinheritance or not, seems to be supported by express provisions of the Civil \nCode. Article 850 provides that \"the, proof of the truthfulness of the reason \nfor disinheritance shall be established by the heirs of the testator, should the \ndisinherited person deny it.\" It would appear then that if the person \ndisinherited should deny the truthfulness of the cause of disinheritance, he \nmight be permitted to support his allegation by proof. The right of the court to \ninquire whether or not the disinheritance was made for just cause is also \nsustained by the provisions of article 851, which in part provides that :<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Disinheritance made without statement of the reason, or for a cause the \ntruth of which, if contradicted, should not be proven * * * shall annul the \ndesignation of heirship, in so far as it prejudices the person \ndisinherited.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It seems clear from the above-quoted provisions, that the courts may inquire \ninto the justice of a disinheritance such as was attempted in the present case, \nand if they find that the disinheritance was without cause, that part of the \ntestament or will may be pronounced null and void. It remains, however, to be \nseen whether the evidence adduced during the trial of the present cause was \nsufficient to show that the disinheritance made in paragraph 3 of the will was \nmade for just cause. It appears from the record that when Rosario Mediavillo was \nabout 14 years of age, she had received some attentions from a young man\u2014that \nshe had received a letter from him\u2014and that her grandfather, Florencio Pecson, \ntook occasion to talk to her about the relations between her and the said young \nman; that it was upon that occasion when, it is alleged, the disobedience and \ndisrespect were shown to her grandfather, and that was the cause for her \ndisinheritance by her grandfather. The record shows that very soon after said \nevent she lost the use of her mental powers and that she has never regained \nthem, except for very brief periods, up to the present time. The lower court, \ntaking into consideration her tender years, and the fact that she very soon \nthereafter lost the use of her mental faculties, reached the conclusion that she \nwas probably not responsible for the disrespect and disobedience shown to her \ngrandfather in the year 1894 or 1895.<\/p>\n<p>After a careful consideration of the record, we are inclined to believe that \nthe same supports the conclusions of the lower court and that he did not commit \nthe error complained of in the first assignment of error.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to, the second assignment of error, it will be remembered that \nTeresa Pecson, the mother of Rosario Mediavillo, at the time of her death left \ntwo children, Rosario and Joaquin, and her husband Basiliso Mediavillo, and that \nthe said Joaquin Mediavillo died without heirs. The lower court gave one-half of \nthe inheritance of the said Teresa Pecson to Rosario Mediavillo and the share \nthat would have gone to Joaquin Mediavillo, to his father Basiliso Mediavillo. \nIn that conclusion of the lower court we think error was committed. The \nappellant relies upon the provisions of article 925 of the Civil Code, in his \ncontention that the lower court committed an error. Article 925 provides \nthat:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The right of representation shall always take place in the direct descending \nline, but never in the ascending. In collateral lines, it shall take place only \nin favor of the children of brothers or sisters, whether they be of the whole or \nhalf blood.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The appellee, in support of the conclusions of the lower court, cites \narticles 935 and 936 of the Civil Code. Article 935 provides that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In the absence of legitimate children and descendants of the deceased, his \nascendants shall inherit from him, to the exclusion of \ncollaterals.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Article 936 provides that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The father and mother, if living, shall inherit share and share alike. If \none of them only survive, he or she shall succeed to the son's entire \nestate.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It will be remembered that the whole argument of the appellants with \nreference to the first assignment of error was that Rosario Mediavillo had been \ndisinherited and the court evidently believed that there were no \"legitimate \nchildren, descendants of the deceased, surviving,\" and that therefore the father \nor mother of said legitimate children would inherit as ascendants. Inasmuch, \nhowever, as there was a descendant in the direct line, surviving, the \ninheritance could not ascend, and for that reason the lower court committed an \nerror in declaring that Basiliso Mediavillo was entitled to inherit that share \nof the estate that would have belonged to Joaquin Mediavillo, had he been \nliving. Therefore, and for all of. the foregoing, that part of the judgment of \nthe lower court nullifying and setting aside paragraph 3 of the will is hereby \naffirmed, and that part of said judgment which decrees to Basiliso Mediavillo \none-half of the estate of Florencio Pecson, belonging to Teresa Pecson and which \nwould have been given to Joaquin Mediavillo, had he been surviving, is hereby \nrevoked. And without any finding as to costs, it is hereby ordered that the \ncause be remanded to the lower court, with direction that judgment be entered in \naccordance herewith, and that such further proceedings be had as the interested \nparties may deem necessary, for the purpose of disposing of that part of the \ninheritance of Teresa Pecson which would have belonged to Joaquin Mediavillo, \nhud he been surviving.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" no=\"\" shade=\"\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<p><\/p>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"font-style: italic;\"><strong>CONCURRING<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>ARELLANO, C.

On the morning after the night \nduring which the crime must have been committed, ah iron safe in the tienda was \nfound unlocked and the owner of the tienda testified that on his return a few \ndays afterwards there was missing from the safe some P500 in cash and jewelry \nvalued at about P100. There were evidences of a considerable flow of blood from \nthe wound, and traces of blood were found in the tienda, the lot in which it \nstood, and the road leading away from the tienda in the direction of the \nprincipal street of the town of Agusan, near which the tienda is located.\n<p>Filomeno Cassion, Sabino Apduhan, Jacinto Olano, and the female defendant \nAsuncion Calo were charged with the commission of the crime, and after some \ndelay were brought to trial, as a result of which Cassion and Apduhan were \nconvicted of the crime of <em>robo con homicidio,<\/em> Cassion being sentenced \nto death and Apduhan to life imprisonment, while Olano and the female defendant \nwere acquitted.<\/p>\n<p>Accepting as true the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, and \nrejecting as false the testimony of the witnesses for the defense, the following \nis a summary of all the facts disclosed by the evidence of record:<\/p>\n<p>The discovery of the dead body and of the traces of blood in and about the \ntienda, and the disappearance of money and jewelry therefrom as above set forth; \nthe finding, a few days after the commission of the crime, in a house occupied \nby Apduhan, Olano and others of a trunk, admittedly the property of Apduhan, \nwhich contained two bottles of perfume and six heelplates, the bottles of \nperfume being similar to others on sale in the Chinese tienda, and the six heel \nplates being similar to others found attached to a cardboard, which contained \nvacant spaces from which a number of these heelplates had been removed; the \nexplanations of Apduhan (made at the time when the trunk was opened) as to the \npresence of these articles in his trunk, he claiming that he had bought the \nheelplates from a Chinaman named Janhoy who was not called at the trial, and \nthat he had bought the perfume from some peddlers or traveling merchants from \nBohol; the discovery in the same house of a shirt, such as is worn by the \nConstabulary, and admittedly the property of the defendant Olano, with stains of \nhuman blood on the front; the discovery of stains on the stairs of this house \nwhich looked like blood; the discovery in the same house of a kris, admittedly \nthe property of the defendant Cassion, which might have inflicted the fatal \nwound; that the defendants Apduhan and Olano were seen together by one witness \nnot far from the tienda, between 10 and 11 o'clock on the night of the murder, \nand that a little earlier Apduhan talked with two witnesses, at a point not far \ndistant, from whom he endeavored to buy some fish; that Apduhan and Olano were \ntenants or workmen for the defendant Cassion, and that the house in which they \nlived was owned by him; that they are both ignorant men, and were largely \ndependent upon him for their living; that Cassion was at one time a justice of \nthe peace and at another time municipal president of the town of Agusan; that \nthe female defendant was his <em>querida<\/em> or concubine; that he not \ninfrequently visited her at the room in which she lived; that he was seen in \ncompany with this woman between 10 and 11 o'clock of the night of the murder \nstanding near the Chinese tienda; that footprints, found close by the tienda on \nthe morning after the crime, because of their relative size, gave indications of \nhaving been made by a man and a woman; that Cassion and the woman left her house \ntogether about 10 p. m. of the night of the murder and did not return until \nabout 2 a. m., and that as he parted from her at the door he was heard to say to \nher \"Pronto, Ating\" (quick, Ating), and later ''Ating, lo que pase, no cuente\" \n(Ating, whatever happens, don't tell); that on the following morning a fresh \nbloodstain was found on the stairs of the house where the woman lived, by one of \nthe owners of the house, and by her washed or cleaned away; that three or four \ndays afterwards this woman defendant gave two <em>sayas<\/em>, a <em>camison<\/em> \n(wearing apparel), and two pillowcases to one of the women of the house to be \nwashed, explaining that the bloodstains were the result of menstruation, and \ngiving directions with the view to the avoidance of unnecessary publicity; that \nstains, apparently bloodstains, were found on the stairs of Cassion's house some \nlittle time after the commission of the crime, when suspicion had been directed \nagainst him; that he had had at least one opportunity to watch the Chinese owner \nof the tienda open his safe; that he owed the store some p50 or p60; that on two \nor three occasions, not long after the commission of the crime, this defendant \nlost sums ranging from P30, to P40 in gambling; that on the morning after the \ncommission of the crime he was seen wearing a freshly pressed suit of white \nclothes; and finally, that the defendant Olano, in a written statement \nvoluntarily made at the preliminary trial, testified that on the night of the \ncrime, his codefendant Apduhan left the house in which they lived late in the \nevening, wearing his (Olano's) shirt and carrying with him the kris whkih was \nfound later in the house, and did not return until about 4 a. m., and that \nbefore he left the house he told him (Olano) that their master, Cassion, had \ndirected them both to come to him, bringing with them the kris and another \nweapon, but that he (Olano) had refused to go because he was sick.<\/p>\n<p>The defense put the defendant Olano on the witness stand to deny the truth of \nhis statement made before the justice of the peace, which he claimed was false \nand made as a result of threats and promises by the police officers; witnesses \nwere also called who testified that none of the defendants left their respective \nhouses on the night in question; evidence was also introduced tending to \nestablish the fact that the woman who testified as to the return of Cassion and \nthe woman defendant late at night and the parting warning of Cassion on that \noccasion, was the <em>querida<\/em> or concubine of the police officer who \nsecured the evidence in the case, while the woman who testified as to the fresh \nstain of blood on the stairs of the woman defendant's house was the sister of \nthis police officer's <em>querida<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>We are all of the opinion that this evidence, while it might be sufficient to \ndirect the finger of suspicion toward all of the defendants in a preliminary \ninvestigation before a justice of the peace, is wholly insufficient to sustain a \nsolemn judgment of a trial court, holding them guilty, beyond a reasonable \ndoubt, of the capital crime with which they are charged in the information. <\/p>\n<p>It is not necessary to review the. evidence in relation to the two defendants \nwho were discharged in the court below.<\/p>\n<p>The only competent evidence of record against the defendant Apduhan relates \nto the discovery in his trunk of the perfume and the iron heelplates. Of course, \nthe evidence as to the alleged extrajudicial statements and admissions of his \ncodefendant Olano was wholly incompetentas to Apduhah, in the absence of proof \nof a conspiracy between them for the commission of the crime, in the course of \nwhich these statements or admissions were made., There is no evidence in the \nrecqrd tending to establish the existence of such a conspiracy and in truth \nthere is no evidence whatever tending in any wise to implicate this defendant, \ndirectly or indirectly, other than the discovery of the perfume and heelplates \nin his trunk. While his explanations as to the manner in which he came into \npossession of these articles is not wholly satisfactory, no evidence was \nintroduced to rebut his account of the purchase of these articles, and there is \nnothing inherently impossible or even improbable in his claim that he had \npurchased the heelplates from the Chinaman whose name he mentioned, or that he \npurchased the perfume from peddlers or merchants from Bohol. While it is true \nthat similar articles were on sale in the tienda where the robbery took place, \nwe are of opinion that the discovery of these articles in the possession of \nApduhan does not satisfactorily establish his guilty complicity in the robbery, \nthe proof failing to establish conclusively that they were among the articles \nstolen when the robbery was committed. Heelplates and perfume of the kind found \nin Apduhan's trunk might well have been purchased in any one of dozens of stores \nin the vicinity carrying them in stock. There is nothing whatever to indicate \nthat merchandise of this sort was sold exclusively in the store where the murder \ntook place.<\/p>\n<p>As in the case of Apduhan, so in the case of Cassion, we are precluded from \ntaking into consideration the evidence as to the extrajudicial statements and \nadmissions of his codefendant Olano. Without that evidence, it is impossible to \nsustain a judgment of conviction as to him. The evidence upon which an attempt \nis made to show that on the night of the murder he and his concubine were out \ntogether until a late hour, and that during that night they had walked near by \nthe store where the robbery took place, and that on her return the clothes of \nthe woman were so saturated with blood that it dripped on the stairs of the \nhouse in which she slept is not wholly satisfactory, and even if it were \naccepted as true, it would fall far short of conclusively establishing his \nguilt. At most it would tend to indicate that the woman was in some way \nimplicated, and that he had been in her company both before and after the crime \nwas committed. The evidence to the effect that on the day following the murder, \nhe appeared in a clean suit of clothes; that he lost some:money in gambling some \nlittle time after the commission of the crime; that he comforted his co-accused \nwhen they were arrested by telling them that innocent men need have no fear of \nthe law and advised them to keep their own counsel; that a kris or bolo, \nbelonging to him, was found in the house of his coaccused, who were workmen \nemployed by him; that a spot of dried blood was found on the stairs of his house \nsome considerable time after the murder, and a mass of similar evidence \nintroduced at the trial has no real significance in the absence of proof of a \nconspiracy between himself and his coaccused to commit the crime, or of evidence \ntending directly to connect him with it. Some of these facts, if satisfactorily \nproven, might have some value in corroboration of other evidence directly \nconnecting this accused with the commission of the crime, but taken by \nthemselves they are wholly insufficient to sustain a finding of his guilt.<\/p>\n<p>We conclude, therefore, that the judgment entered in the court below, \nconvicting and sentencing these appellants should be reversed, with the costs of \nthis instance de ofiicio, and that they should be acquitted of the crime of \nwhich they are charged in the information and set at liberty forthwith. So \nordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, \nJJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/><br\/><\/p><\/div>",

Three cases were, by agreement of counsel, \ntried together in the court below. Damages were awarded in each case and all \nwere appealed by the defendants. They will be considered together. Tan Ti, Tiu \nUco, and Tiu Tiao et al., the respective plaintiffs, each owned a retail store \nin Dagupan. The Court of First Instance of Manila issued execution on the \neffects of one Lim Kok Tiu, and ordered notices of garnishment to be served on \neach of the above named present plaintiffs. These notices were forwarded to the \nsheriff of Pangasinan. It appears that the sheriff himself was not in his office \nwhen the notices were received and they were attended to by his deputy, Lopez. \nLopez delivered the notices to another deputy sheriff, Zulueta, for service. \nZulueta, instead of merely serving the notices, informed each of the present \nplaintiffs that unless they submitted their respective bonds in the sum of \nP15,000, he would close their stores. The respective owners asked for time to go \nto Manila to secure bondsmen, which was granted them. On arriving at Manila they \nconsulted their lawyers, who informed them that the sheriff had no right to \nclose their stores upon garnishment process, and told them to return to Dagupan \nand so inform the sheriff and his deputies, with the further admonition that \nsuch action would render the latter liable for damages. The three plaintiffs \nreturned to Dagupan and notified deputies Lopez and Zulueta accordingly, but the \nlatter went ahead and closed the stores on November 13, 1911, placing guards at \neach one. The owners thereupon returned to Manila for further consultation with \ntheir lawyers. Their attorneys consulted with attorney for the plaintiff in the \ncase from which the garnishment process had issued, and the latter sent a \ntelegram to the sheriff on November 14th, instructing him not to close the \nstores but to proceed in accordance with section 431 of the Code of Civil \nProcedure. At the same time he wrote a letter to the sheriff containing the same \ninstructions. Notwithstanding the fact that the contents of the notices which \nthe sheriff's deputies had served on the owners of these stores clearly showed \nthat they were not writs of attachment, and the further instructions from the \ncounsel for the plaintiff in that civil case to the same effect, the deputy \nsheriffs refused to raise the attachment. The owners of the stores thereupon \nfiled the complaints in the present civil actions on November 17, 1911, after \nnotification to the deputy sheriff that such was their intention. On November \n21, 1911, the attachments were raised and the plaintiffs were allowed to resume \nbusiness.\n<p>The lower court awarded damages to the plaintiff Tan Ti as follows:<\/p>\n<table border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">For loss of profits on the sale of goods during the time the store \nwas closed<\/td>\n<td align=\"right\" width=\"11%\">P<\/td>\n<td width=\"37%\">90.00<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Impairment of credit edit<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<td>500.00<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Counsels' fees<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<td>500.00<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Rent <\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<td>22.50<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Wages of employees<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<td>67.50<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Loss of profits from sales of cigarettes<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<td>7.50<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Two trips to Manila<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<td><u>40.00<\/u><\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"5%\">\u00a0<\/td>\n<td width=\"47%\">Total<\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<\/td>\n<td>1,227.50<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table>\n<p>The loss of profits on cigarrette sales was fixed by stipulation of the \nparties. The two items of rent for the building and wages of employees, being \nthe <em>pro rata<\/em> parts of the plaintiffs monthly expenses for these \nservices, should be allowed. It is urged that as one of plaintiff's two trips to \nManila was made before the wrongful attachment of his property, this item should \nbe cut in half. The first trip, however, was the direct result of defendants' \nrepresentations to the plaintiff in their official capacity. We are of the \nopinion that the defendants would have been liable for this expense even if they \nhad followed the instructions which they received from Manila as the result of \nplaintiff's first trip to Manila. They had no right to make such representations \nto the plaintiff on the strength of the notices which they were called upon to \nserve, and such representations were the direct and proximate cause which \ninduced plaintiff to make the trip. The expenses of both trips should be \nallowed, and this item of damages is therefore approved. . Loss of profits from \nsales for the time the store was closed was based upon the record of sales made \nby the plaintiff during the months of October, November, and December, 1911. The \nfigures were as follows: October, P1,517.54; November, P924.19; and December, \nP1,651.54. Upon these figures, the reduction in gross sales was fixed at P600 \nand profits allowed at 15 per cent, or P90. This seems to be a fair and \nreasonable method of arriving at plaintiff's loss on this item and should be \nallowed.<\/p>\n<p>We accept the statement of counsel for the defendants to the effect that of \nthe item of P500 for attorneys' fees, P200 were paid for services rendered in \nsecuring the release of the goods and P300 for prosecuting the present suit for \ndamages.<\/p>\n<p>That attorney's fees in excess of the amount fixed by statute cannot be taxed \nas costs against the adverse party in any case is well settled. (Sees. 489 and \n492, Code Civ. Proc; Mendiola <em>vs.<\/em> Villa, 15 Phil. Rep., 131; Orense \n<em>vs.<\/em> Jaucian, 18 Phil. Rep., 553.) Can such fees be allowed in this \njurisdiction as an element of damages?<\/p>\n<p>The decisions of the State courts in the American Union on this question are \npot uniform. They are irreconcilable, some holding that reasonable counsel fees \nincurred in procuring the dissolution of injunctions, attachments, and in \nrecovering property wrongfully seized is a proper element of damages, the amount \nbeing limited to fees paid for procuring the dissolution or recovery and not for \nthe general defense of the case or for prosecuting suits for damages. These \nholdings proceed upon the idea that the party has been compelled to employ \ncounsel to rid himself of an unjust restriction which his adversary has placed \nupon him. The courts which take the opposite view say that it is difficult to \nsee upon what ground counsel fees incurred by the adverse party should be \ncharged up to the defeated party any more in attachment and injunction cases \nthan in other litigations upon contracts or for damages for torts. The \nlitigation they say may be equally unjust and oppressive in other cases as in \ncases of attachment, injunctions and replevin. It is true, however, they reason, \nthat attachments and injunctions are in some respects more summary and may \nentail damages arising out of the seizure of defendant's property; but all of \nthis is provided for by the terms of the bond required to cover damages \nsustained. But counsel fees are as necessary in the one class of cases as in the \nother and are neither peculiar nor more erroneous in cases of attachments and \ninjunctions than in other cases.<\/p>\n<p>The authorities on either side of this question are eminent and there is no \nmiddle ground upon which to stand. The authorities pro and con may be found \ncollated in the case notes of the following cases: Littleton <em>vs.<\/em> \nBurgess (16 L. R. A., N. S., 49) ; Lindeberg <em>vs.<\/em> Howard (8 Am. &amp; \nEng. Ann. Cas., 709, injunction) ; Plymouth Gold Mining Co. <em>vs.<\/em> U. S. \nFidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. (10 Am. &amp; Eng. Ann. Cas., 951, attachment) ; \nLake <em>vs.<\/em> Hargis (30 L. R. A., N. S., 366, replevin) ; Winkler \n<em>vs.<\/em> Roeder (8 Am. St. Rep., 155, attorneys' fees as element of \ndamages).<\/p>\n<p>In the United States Supreme Court and in the Federal Courts such fees are \nnot allowed. The case first decided by the United States Supreme Court upon this \npoint and which has been steadfastly adhered to ever since is Oelrichs <em>vs. \n<\/em>Spain (15 Wall., 211, 221). In this case the court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The point here in question has never been expressly decided by this court, \nbut it is clearly within the reasoning of the case last referred to, and we \nthink is substantially determined by that adjudication. In debt, covenant and \nassumpsit damages are recovered, but counsel fees are never included. So in \nequity cases, where there is no injunction bond, only the taxable costs are \nallowed to the complainants. The same rule is applied to the defendant, however \nunjust the litigation on the other side, and however large the <em>expensa \nlitis<\/em> to which he may have been subjected. The parties in this respect are \nupon a footing of equality. There is no fixed standard by which the honorarium \ncan be measured. Some counsel demand much more than others. Some clients are \nwilling to pay more than others. More counsel may be employed than are \nnecessary. When both client and counsel know that the fees are to be paid by the \nother party there is danger of abuse. A reference to a master, or an issue to a \njury, might be necessary to ascertain the proper amount, and this grafted \nlitigation might possibly be more animated and protracted than that in the \noriginal cause. It would be an office of some delicacy on the part of the court \nto scale down the charges, as might sometimes be necessary.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Since the enunciation of this doctrine the Supreme Court of the United States \nhas had occasion to reverse several decisions of State courts where attorneys' \nfees for services in dissolving writs of injunction and attachment were allowed, \nthe writs having issued out of Federal courts and actions for damages brought in \nthe State courts. (Tullock <em>vs.<\/em> Mulvane, 184 U. S., 497, reversing 61 \nKan., 650; 46 L. ed., 657; Mo. etc. R. Co. <em>vs.<\/em> Elliott, 184 U. S., 530; \n46 L. ed., 673, reversing 154 Mo., 300.) <\/p>\n<p>The case at bar is one of replevin. In this country the damages must be \ndetermined and assessed in the principal action. Two actions, one of replevin \nand the other for damages, cannot be maintained. This makes the apportionment of \nattorneys' fees exceedingly difficult and in the absence of an agreement \npractically impossible. In those jurisdictions where attorneys' fees are allowed \nas an element of damages two actions as a rule are required.<\/p>\n<p>After an examination of all the available authorities we have concluded that \nsound public policy demands that counsel fees in suits of the character of the \none under consideration should not be regarded as a proper element of damages, \neven where they are capable of being apportioned so as to show the amount \nincurred for the release of the goods as separate and distinct from the other \nservices necessary in the prosecution of the suit for damages. It is not sound \npublic policy to place a penalty on the right to litigate. To compel the \ndefeated party to pay the fees of counsel for his successful opponent would \nthrow wide the door of temptation to the opposing party and his counsel to swell \nthe fees to undue proportions, and to apportion them arbitrarily between those \npertaining properly to one branch of the case from the other.<\/p>\n<p>This court has already placed itself on record as favoring the view taken by \nthose courts which hold that attorneys' fees are not a proper element of \ndamages. In Ortiga Bros. &amp; Co. <em>vs.<\/em> Enage and Yap Tico (18 Phil. \nRep., 345), a wrongful attachment on the pier belonging to plaintiffs had issued \nat the request of Yap Tico. Ortiga Bros, sued out an injunction preventing the \nattempted sale of the pier by the sheriff and the matter was then held in \n<em>statu quo<\/em> pending judgment of the court as to the right of the sheriff \nto attach and sell the property. Judgment in the lower court was in favor of the \nplaintiffs and damages were awarded in the amount ofP600 which proved to consist \nentirely of the fees of plaintiff's attorney. This court expressly disallowed \nthe same, awarding the plaintiffs only the usual statutory costs.<\/p>\n<p>As to the item of P500 for impairment of plaintiff's credit: Plaintiff \ntestified that he was conducting a credit business with wholesale houses in \nManila, and that when his stock of goods was seized by the sheriff he so \ninformed these houses, who thereupon stopped his credit; that on being restored \nto possession of his goods he so advised them. Although he states that by \nstoppage of his credit he was unable to secure merchandise for Christmas sales, \nit appears from his books,' as stated above, that he sold P1,651.54 during the \nmonth of December, which was as much as, if not more, than he had sold during \nthe same month of the previous year. The wrongfulness of the seizure was so \napparent that a satisfactory explanation of the same could easily have been \ngiven to the wholesale houses with which he was doing business, and it \napparently had no effect on his sales for the month of December. As we have \nallowed him the profits on P600 for sales which he was prevented from making \nduring the month of November, it appears that the damage from interruption to \nhis business has been fully compensated. So that, without touching upon the \nvexatious question of whether damages to credit might be allowed in a proper \ncase, we are of the opinion that such damages in this case, if any, were so \ninfinitesimal and speculative, that they cannot be allowed.<\/p>\n<p>Our decision in the Tan Ti case disposes of the questions raised in the other \ntwo cases. All the items allowed in those cases being of a similar character and \nhaving been computed in the same manner as those in the first case, should be \nallowed, with the exception of the amounts allowed as attorneys' fees and for \nimpairment of credit. In both cases these items are disallowed.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgments appealed from are modified as \nfollows: Damages in Tan Ti's case are reduced to P227.50; in Tiu Uco's case, to \nP460.50; and in the case of Tiu Tiao et al., to P987. As thus modified, the \njudgments appealed from are affirmed. Without costs in this instance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The basis of the action is that the bequest was void under article 752 \nof the Civil Code in that the will in which the bequest is found was made during \nthe last illness of the testatrix and said bequest was in favor of the religious \nsociety to which the priest belonged who administered the last rites to the \ntestatrix.\n<p>The trial court held the bequest void and ordered the return of the sum paid \nin pursuance thereof.<\/p>\n<p>It is admitted that the legacy in question, which was one of P3,000, was made \nby the testatrix during her last illness and that, during said last illness, she \nwas confessed by Friar Ulpiano Herrero, a priest and member of the community of \nthe defendant and that the testatrix died the day after the confession was \nmade.<\/p>\n<p>The defense is based upon two propositions: First, that article 752 of the \nCivil Code has been repealed by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, \nespecially section 622 thereof; and, second, that the plaintiff accepted, \nwithout objection, the provisions of the will and the distribution of the \nproperty thereunder, including the payment of the legacy complained of, and is, \ntherefore, estopped from questioning such distribution and especially the \nvalidity of the legacy, the question having, it is claimed, become <em>res \njudicata<\/em> by the final order of distribution in the probate proceedings.<\/p>\n<p>Article 752 of the Civil Code reads as follows: \"Testamentary provisions made \nby the testator during his last illness in favor of the priest who took his \nconfession during the same, of the relatives of the latter within the fourth \nCalderon <em>vs.<\/em> Provincia del Santisimo Rosario, degree, or of his church, \nchapter, community, or institute shall not be valid,\"<\/p>\n<p>Section 622 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows : \" When devise \nor legacy to witness void.\u2014If a person attests the execution of a will, to whom \nor to whose wife or husband, or parent, or child, a beneficial devise, legacy, \nor interest, of or affecting real or personal estate, is given by such will, \nsuch devise, legacy, or interest shall, so far only as concerns such person, or \nthe wife or husband, or parent or child of such person, or anyone claiming under \nsuch person, or such wife or husband, or parent or child, be void, unless there \nare three, other competent witnesses to such will, and such person so attesting \nshall be admitted as a witness as if such devise, legacy, or interest had not \nbeen made or given. But a mere charge on the real or personal estate of the \ntestator, for the payment of debts, shall not prevent his creditors from being \ncompetent witnesses to his will.\"<\/p>\n<p>We are unable to see what bearing section 622 of the Code of Civil Procedure \njust quoted has upon the question at issue. Before a statute can be held to have \nrepealed a prior statute by implication, it must appear, first, that the two \nstatutes touch the same subject matter, and, second, that the later statute is \nrepugnant to the earlier. Neither one of these conditions is present in the \ncase before us. The article of the Civil Code quoted refers exclusively to \ntestamentary dispositions and the circumstances under which they will be illegal \nand unenforceable. It has nothing to do with the form or manner of execution of \nthe will or who shall not he witnesses thereto. Section 622 of the Code of Civil \nProcedure, on the other hand, refers exclusively to the execution of a will. It \nhas nothing to do with the legality of its dispositions except so far as they \nare affected by the form and manner of its execution.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, both sections can be applied to the same will. If in the case \nbefore us there had been another legacy in the will to a person who was a \nwitness thereto, there would have been presented a case in which both sections \nwould be applicable. Article 752 would be applicable because the will was made \nduring the last illness of the testatrix and the priest who administered the \nlast rites to the deceased was a member of the order that received the legacy. \nSection 622 would be applicable because one of the witnesses to the will had \nreceived a legacy thereunder. When two statutes may be equally applicable to the \nsame will, and neither be in conflict with the other, it is clear that they \ncannot be repugnant to each other, that they can both stand together, and that, \ntherefore, the one is not impliedly repealed by the other.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, as the case now stands, section 622 cannot possibly be \napplicable, because no one was a witness to the will' who received a legacy \nthereunder. If there can arise a case in which two statutes alleged to be \nrepugnant to each other cannot both be applicable, then it is clear that they do \nnot treat of the same subject matter, are, therefore, not repugnant and, as a \nnecessary consequence, the later does not repeal the earlier.<\/p>\n<p>Coming now to the contention that the validity of the legacy to the defendant \nhas already been determined and that the plaintiff is estopped from questioning \nsuch validity, we may say that the evidence shows that the plaintiff was a minor \nduring all of the proceedings leading up to and including the final settlement \nof the estate of his mother. No guardian ad litem was appointed for him and it \ndoes not appear that he was represented by anyone who had authority to bind \nhim.<\/p>\n<p>It is contended, however, that the plaintiff is estopped from maintaining \nthis action in that on the 24th of January, 1911, he signed the following paper: \n\"Now comes Jose Calderon, heir in the above-entitled case, and respectfully \nrepresents, that he has examined carefully the statement of account rendered by \nthe administrator, as well as the project of partition, and the bill of the \nadministrator for fees, and believes that the same are just and reasonable.\"<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff insists that in signing said document he believed that he was \napproving merely the administrator's accounts and the reasonableness of his fees \nand was not engaged in passing upon the legality of any particular provision of \nthe will or the payment of legacies as ordered by the will or the distribution \nof the estate as finally made. The wording of the document lends some color to \nthis contention and its date shows that it was executed about one year before \nthe project of partition was made which the plaintiff is supposed to have \nratified by said document.<\/p>\n<p>The learned trial court was not satisfied that the plaintiff expressed his \nconformity with the proposed distribution or the proposed payment of legacies. \nWe agree with the trial court upon this point and also are of the opinion that \nsuch approval, if it may be called an approval, is not binding upon the \nplaintiff, who, at that time, was a minor and was not represented by anyone who \nwas authorized to contract for him. Not being bound by that ratification, the \nplaintiff, on coming of age, was entitled to attack the provisions of the will \nif they were void by reason of illegality. He reached the age of 21 on the 2d \nday of February, 1913, and this suit was instituted on the 24th of the same \nmonth. No ratification can be implied from this short lapse of time, in the \nabsence of conduct on the part of the plaintiff indicating clearly an intention \nto ratify.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

This motion was agreed to by the defendants Battle and \nwife, and, in open court, counsel for both parties orally requested the court to \nconfirm the report in accordance with the motion of the city attorney.<\/p>\n<p>On September 3, 1912, the court, disregarding the agreement of the parties, \nand without notice to the parties and without evidence other than that found in \nthe report, rendered a judgment disapproving the report in so far as it related \nto the damages allowed Batlle and wife and made other and different findings, \nand, thereon, reduced the award made them from P119,173.40 to \nP105,144.50.<br\/><br\/>The appellants excepted to the new findings and the judgment \nbased thereon and moved the court to set it aside and to grant a. new trial upon \nseveral grounds, among them being that the action of the court was unjustified, \nin violation of the agreement of the parties affected, and beyond the power of \nthe court to make. This motion was denied and the appellants duly excepting \nthereto appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>It is contended by the appellants that, \nunder the facts above related, it was the duty of the trial court to approve the \nreport of the commissioners and that the law did not justify it in setting it \naside and making findings of its own prejudicial to the interests of the \nappellants. The appellants assert that both parties litigant having agreed to \nthe findings of the commissioners, having accepted the award made thereby, and \nhaving manifested that conformity in proper form, and having agreed in open \ncourt to the confirmation of the report as presented, the trial court had no \nauthority to do otherwise than to confirm.<\/p>\n<p>The appellee, on the other hand, contends, as a matter of fact, that there \nwas no agreement between the attorneys for the parties relative to the \nconfirmation of the report of the commissioners, saying:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The fatal defect in appellants' position is that the agreement which they \nrely on as the basis for their appeal is purely an invention of counsel, never \nhaving had any existence in fact. The circumstances which counsel construe into \na binding stipulation were these: On the filing of the report of the \ncommissioners, counsel for the city, who in the proceedings before the \ncommission had vigorously contested the extravagant estimates of value placed \nupon appellants' land by alleged experts, filed on August 3, 1912, the following \nmotion:<\/p>\n<p>\" 'The undersigned attorney for the plaintiff, the city of Manila, in the \nabove-entitled action, prays the court to approve and confirm the report of the \ncommissioners in said cause and render a decision in conformity therewith.'<\/p>\n<p>\"On presenting the above motion in open court, counsel for both sides \nsubmitted 'said report to the court without objection and with a verbal request \nfor its approval.'\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We cannot agree with the position of counsel for the city above set out, in \nso far as it denies conformity on the part of counsel for the interested parties \nfor the approval by the court of the report of the commission. Counsel himself \nadmits, as expressly appears in the bill of exceptions, that the counsel for the \ncity moved the court for the confirmation of the report, that counsel for the \nappellants joined in the motion, and that both together prayed in open court \nthat said report be confirmed.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, there appears in one of the bills of exception filed on this appeal \nthe following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"On the 18th of September, 1912, the plaintiff, the city of Manila, and the \ndefendants, Evaristo Batlle y Hernandez and his wife Luisa Alvarez Estrada y \nArrieta, presented the following agreement:<br\/><br\/>\" 'It is hereby agreed \nbetween the city of Manila, plaintiff, and Evaristo Batlle y Hernandez and his \nwife, Luisa Estrada, defendants, that when the above-entitled cause was called \nfor hearing upon the report of the commissioners, the city attorney, Hon. I. \nAdams, in representation of the city of Manila, and W. A. Kincaid, in \nrepresentation of the defendants Batlle and wife, submitted the said report to \nthe court without objection and with a verbal request for its \napproval.'\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The bill of exceptions containing this agreement was expressly approved by \nthe attorney for the city on the 2d day of October, 1912, as well as by the \ncourt on the 3d of October of the same year.<\/p>\n<p>While, speaking technically, there was no express stipulation for judgment, \nthere was, nevertheless, such an agreement between the parties relating thereto \nas to amount to the same thing in law. Although, as counsel says, the agreement \njust quoted was not made until long after the events to which it refers and \nwhich it incorporates occurred nevertheless, it embodies, and thereby concedes, \nthe existence of those events, and the existence of those events discloses a \nperfect agreement between the parties interested relative to the approval and \nconfirmation of the commissioners' report, in so far as it affected their \ninterests.<\/p>\n<p>The question naturally arises then whether, under such circumstances, the \ncourt was justified in law in disregarding the conformity of the parties \nrelative to the confirmation of the report and, upon its own motion, to proceed \nto make findings of fact and conclusions of law of its own and to render a \njudgment thereupon materially different from that which it would have rendered \nit if had followed the agreement of the parties interested.<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the court erred and that its judgment must be \nreversed to the extent to which it changed the report of the commission relative \nto the award made to these appellants. Section 246 of the Code of Civil \nProcedure provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Upon the filing of such report in court, the court shall, upon hearing, \naccept the same and render judgment in accordance therewith; or for cause shown, \nit may recommit the report to the commissioners for further report of facts; or \nit may set aside the report and appoint new commissioners ; or it may accept the \nreport in part and reject it in part, and may make such final order and judgment \nas shall secure to the plaintiff the property essential to the exercise of his \nrights under the law, and to the defendant just compensation for the land so \ntaken; * * *.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From this section it is clear that, on the presentation to the court of the \nreport of the commissioners, the court shall accept the same and render judgment \nin accordance therewith. That is the first duty thrust upon the court when the \nreport is presented. Under certain conditions, however, the court may do other \nthings. It may recommit the report to the committee; it may set it aside and \nappoint new commissioners; it may accept the report in part and reject it in \npart and make such final order as may be just and proper. But it can do these \nthings only upon a condition named in the section and that is that cause be \nshown.<\/p>\n<p>The showing of cause is a condition precedent for doing anything except to \nconfirm the report. This means that cause must be shown by the parties \ninterested. The court itself has no interest in the matter except, perhaps, in \ncases where it clearly appears that a fraud has been committed upon the court or \nupon the public by the report or that the findings of the commission are such as \nto show fraud, corruption, or bad faith. Its duty, in the absence of cause \nshown, is to confirm the report. This is so even though there is objection made \nto it. How much more is it its duty when the parties themselves affirmatively \nagree upon the justice, equity, and legality of the report and jointly ask for \nits confirmation.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed and the cause remanded to the court \nwhence it came, with instructions to enter a judgment in favor of the appellants \nand against the appellee for the sum found, by the report of the commissioners \nto be due them. Of the judgment so entered only that part thereof will be \ncollectible which remains unpaid, with interest thereon. No costs in this \ninstance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

EVARISTO VAQUILAR, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The appellant, Evaristo Vaquilar, was charged in two separate informations \nwith parricide, in one for the killing of his wife and in the other for the \nkilling of his daughter. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, to indemnify the \nheirs, to the accessory penalties, and to the payment of the costs in each case. \nFrom this judgment he appealed. The two cases have been submitted to this court \ntogether.\n<p>The appellant in these two cases was proven to have killed his wife and \ndaughter in the manner charged and to have wounded other persons with a bolo. \nThe commission of these crimes is not denied. The defendant did not testify but \nseveral witnesses were introduced in his behalf, testifying that the defendant \nappeared to them to be insane at and subsequent to the commission of the crimes. \nThey also testified that he had been complaining of pains in his head and \nstomach prior to the killing.<br\/><br\/>Our attention has been directed to the \nfollowing testimony: Martin Agustin, witness for the prosecution, testified that \nhe heard the appellant, his uncle, making a noise, and that he rushed into the \nhouse and saw the appellant kill his wife and daughter; that he was also cut by \nthe appellant; that there \"were seven, including the small boys and girls who \nwere cut by him;\" that he did not know of any disagreement between the appellant \nand the two deceased; that on the morning of that day Gregoria Villamar had said \nsometime before she was killed that the appellant had \"felt pains in his head \nand stomach,\" The witness further stated that the appellant's \"eyes were very \nbig and red and his sight penetrating\" at the time he was killing his wife and \ndaughter, and that \"according to my own eyes as he looked at me he was crazy \nbecause if he was not crazy he would not have killed his family\u2014his wife and \nchild.\"<\/p>\n<p>Diego Agustin, a witness for the defense, testified that he helped Martin \nAgustin capture the appellant; that the appellant \"himself used to say before \nthat time he had felt pains in the head and the stomach;\" that at the moment he \nwas cutting those people \"he looked like a madman; crazy because he would cut \neverybody at random without paying any attention to who it was.\"<\/p>\n<p>Alexandra Vaquilar, the appellant's sister, testified that her brother had \nheadache and stomach trouble about five days\" prior to the commission of the \ncrimes; that \"he looked very sad at the time, but I saw him run downstairs and \nthen he pursued me;\" and that \"he must have been crazy because he cut me.\" <\/p>\n<p>Estanislao Canada, who was a prisoner confined in the same jail with the \nappellant, testified that he had observed the appellant about five months and \nthat sometimes \"his head is not all right;\" that \"oftentimes since he came to \nthe jail when he is sent for something he goes all right without saying \nanything, even if he comes back he does not say anything at all;\" that when the \nappellant returns from work he does not say a word; and that about every other \nnight he, the appellant, cries aloud, saying, \"What kind of people are you to \nme, what are you doing to me, you are beasts.\"<\/p>\n<p>The health officer who examined the two deceased and the other wounded \nparties found that the appellant's wife had five mortal wounds on the head, \nbesides several other wounds on her hands; and that the daughter's skull was \nsplit \"through and through from one side to the other.\" The witness stated that \nhe made a slight examination of the defendant in the jail and that he did not \nnotice whether defendant was suffering from any mental derangement or not.<\/p>\n<p>There is a vast difference between an insane person and one who has worked \nhimself up into such a frenzy of anger that he fails to use reason or good \njudgment in what he does. Persons who get into a quarrel or fight seldom, if \never, act naturally during the fight. An extremely angry man, often, if not \nalways, acts like a madman. The fact that a person acts crazy is not conclusive \nthat he is insane. The popular meaning of the word \"crazy\" is not synonymous \nwith the legal terms \"insane,\" <em>\"non compos mentis,\"<\/em> \"unsound mind,\" \n\"idiot,\" or \"lunatic.\" In this case, as before indicated, 'one witness testified \nthat \"according to my own eyes as he looked at me he was crazy because if he was \nnot crazy he would not have killed his family.\" That witness' conception of the \nword \"crazy\" evidently is the doing of some act by a person which an ordinarily \nrational person would not think of doing. Another witness testified that \"he \nlooked like a madman; crazy, because he would cut everybody at random without \npaying any attention to who it was.\" It is not at all unnatural for a murderer, \ncaught in the act of killing his wife and child, to fly into a passion and \nstrike promiscuously at those who attempt to capture him. The appellant's sister \nsaid \"he must have been crazy because he cut me.\" This is another illustration \nof the popular conception of the word \"crazy,\" it being thus used to describe a \nperson or an act unnatural or out of the ordinary.<\/p>\n<p>The conduct of the appellant after he was confined in jail as described by \nhis fellow prisoner is not inconsistent with the actions of a sane person. The \nreflection and remorse which would follow the commission of such deeds as those \ncommitted by the appellant might be sufficient to cause the person to cry out, \n\"What kind of people are you to me; what are you doing to me; you are beasts,\" \nand yet such conduct would not be sufficient to show that the person was insane \nat the time the deeds were committed.<\/p>\n<p>In People <em>vs.<\/em> Mortimer (48 Mich., 37; 11 N. W., 776), the defendant \nwas indicted for an assault with intent to murder. The defense attempted to \nprove \"a mental condition which would involve no guilt.\" The supreme court on \nappeal in its decision distinguished between <em>passion<\/em> and \n<em>insanity<\/em> as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"But passion and insanity are very different things, and whatever indulgence \nthe law may extend to persons under provocation, it does not treat them as freed \nfrom criminal responsibility. Those who have not lost control of their reason by \nmental unsoundness are bound to control their tempers and restrain their \npassions, and are liable to the law if they do not. Where persons allow their \nanger to lead them so far as to make them reckless, the fact that they have \nbecome at last too infuriated to keep them from mischief is merely the result of \nnot applying restraint in season. There would be no safety for society if people \ncould with impunity lash themselves into fury, and then do desperate acts of \nviolence. That condition which springs from undisciplined and unbridled passion \nis clearly within legal as well as moral censure and punishment. (People \n<em>vs.<\/em> Finley, 38 Mich., 482; Welch <em>vs.<\/em> Ware, 32 Mich., \n77.)\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In People <em>vs.<\/em> Foy (138 N. Y., 664), the court said: \"The court very \nproperly continued with an explanation to the jury that 'the heat of passion and \nfeeling produced by motives of anger, hatred, or revenge, is not insanity. The \nlaw holds the doer of the act, under such conditions, responsible for the crime, \nbecause a large share of homicides committed are occasioned by just such motives \nas these.' \"<\/p>\n<p>The Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure (vol. 12, p. 170), cites many cases on \nthe subject of anger and emotional insanity and sums up those decisions in the \nfollowing concise statement:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Although there have been some decisions to the contrary, it is now well \nsettled that mere mental depravity, or moral insanity, so called, which results, \nnot from any disease of mind, but from a perverted condition of the moral \nsystem, where the person is mentally sane, does not exempt one from \nresponsibility for crimes committed under its influence. Care must be taken to \ndistinguish between mere moral insanity or mental depravity and irresistible \nimpulse resulting from disease of the mind.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the case of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Carmona (18 Phil. Rep., 62), the \ndefendant was convicted of the crime of lesiones graves. The defendant's \ncounsel, without raising any question as to the actual commission of the alleged \nacts, or the allegation that the accused committed them, confined himself to the \nstatement, in behalf of his client, that on the night of the crime the defendant \nwas sick with fever and out of his mind and that in one of his paroxysms he \ncommitted the said acts, wounding his wife and the other members of her family, \nwithout any motives whatever. In the decision in that case this court \nstated:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In the absence of proof that the defendant had lost his reason or became \ndemented a few moments prior to or during the perpetration of the crime, it is \npresumed that he was in a normal condition of mind. It is improper to conclude \nthat he acted unconsciously, in order to relieve him from responsibility on the \nground of exceptional mental condition, unless his insanity and absence of will \nare proven.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the burden of proof in cases where insanity is pleaded in defense \nof criminal actions, we quote as follows from State <em>vs.<\/em> Bundy (24 S. C, \n439; 58 Am. Rep. 262, 265):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"But as the usual condition of men is that of sanity, there is a presumption \nthat the accused is sane, which certainly in the first instance affords proof of \nthe fact. (State, <em>vs.<\/em> Coleman, 20 S. C, 454.) If the killing and \nnothing more appears, this presumption, without other proof upon the point of \nsanity, is sufficient to support a conviction and as the State must prove every \nelement of the crime charged 'beyond a reasonable doubt,' it follows that this \npresumption affords such proof. This presumption however may be overthrown. It \nmay be shown on the part of the accused that the criminal intent did not exist \nat the time the act was committed. This being exceptional is a defense, and like \nother defenses must be made out by the party claiming the benefit of it. 'The \npositive existence of that degree and kind of insanity that shall work a \ndispensation to the prisoner in a case of established homicide is a fact to be \nproved as it is affirmed by him.' (State <em>vs.<\/em> Stark, 1 Strob., 506.)<\/p>\n<p>\"What then is necessary to make out this defense? It surely cannot be \nsufficient merely to allege insanity to put his sanity 'in issue.' That is \nmerely a pleading, a denial, and ineffectual without proof. In order to make out \nsuch defense, as it seems to us, sufficient proof must be shown to overcome in \nthe first place the presumption of sanity and then any other proof that may be \noffered.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the case of State <em>vs.<\/em> Stickley (41 Iowa, 232), the court said \n(syllabus):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"One who, in possession of a sound mind, commits a criminal act under the \nimpulse of passion or revenge, which may temporarily dethrone reason and for the \nmoment control the will, cannot nevertheless be shielded from the consequences \nof the act by th\u00a3 plea of insanity.

They proceeded to a \ndivision of the real estate without taking into consideration that portion of \nthe will relating to the advances to the petitioner and divided the property \nequally between the petitioner and the respondent.<\/p>\n<p>Before the report of the commissioners partitioning the property was approved \nby the court, their attention was called to the provisions in the will relative \nto the advances and they thereupon changed their report by deducting from the \nproperty which they had allowed him the value of the advances. In making this \ndeduction it was found that the amount of the advances exceeded the value of the \nproperty which the petitioner would have received if there had been no advances, \nand accordingly, the commissioners reported that all of the property described \nin the will be turned over to the widow. This report was duly approved by the \ncourt, which entered a judgment thereon turning the property over to the \nwidow.<\/p>\n<p>Upon ascertaining that the order just-mentioned had been entered turning the \nproperty over to his mother, the petitioner immediately made an application to \nthe court to set aside the order upon the ground that it was made without notice \nto him and that it was obtained by the mother by fraud, misrepresentation, and \ndeceit. The application came on for a hearing, the parties were heard, and the \ncourt found, upon all the facts and circumstances of the case, that the \npetitioner had received notice of the hearing on the commissioners' report; that \nno fraud had been practiced by anybody upon him; that he was not entitled to the \nrelief asked for; and, accordingly, denied his motion. <\/p>\n<p>Thereupon petitioner brought this proceeding for the purposes already \nmentioned.<\/p>\n<p>A mere statement of the case is sufficient to show the lack of grounds for \nthe proceeding. It will be seen from a reading of section 513 that the remedy \ngranted thereby is available only in case the Court of First Instance which made \nthe order \"has finally adjourned so that no adequate remedy exists in that \ncourt.\" The section reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Procedure in cases of defaults caused by fraud, accident, or mistake. When a \njudgment is rendered by a Court of First Instance upon default, and a party \nthereto is unjustly deprived of a hearing by fraud, accident, mistake, or \nexcusable negligence, and the Court of First Instance which rendered the \njudgment has finally adjourned so that no adequate remedy exists in that court, \nthe party so deprived of a hearing may present his petition to the Supreme Court \nwithin sixty days after he first learns of the rendition of such judgment, and \nnot thereafter, setting forth the facts and praying to have such judgment set \naside. * * * \"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It is clear that, if the Court of First Instance which rendered the judgment \nor made the order is still in session, the party aggrieved should present his \npetition directly to that court. This is precisely what he did. He obtained from \nthat court a reconsideration of the order complained of, presented the facts \nupon which he based his relief, and the court, after full consideration, found \nthat he had failed to prove the facts necessary to obtain relief and, therefore, \ndenied it. This being the case, the remedy under section 513 is not available. \nThe condition precedent to the right to that remedy, viz., that the court which \nmade the order \"has finally adjourned so that no adequate remedy exists in that \ncourt' is not present. The petitioner could have. excepted to the order denying \nhis motion and could have taken his appeal therefrom as provided by law.

Mendezona &amp; Co., a partnership, in liquidation, obtained a judgment \non a bond in the Court of First Instance of Manila in civil cause No. 3326 \nagainst Mariano Moreno, as principal, and against Amalia Moreno, Camilo Moreno, \nand Rafael Serra, as sureties, for the sum of P18,154.24, with interest at 6 \npercent per annum from the 11th day February, 1905; together with costs. \nMendezona &amp; Co. on the 2d day of July, 1908, by an instrument in writting, \nsold and transferred said judgment to G. Urruitia &amp; Co.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. On the 1st day of July, 1908, the sheriff sold under execution issued \nupon the judgment described in the preceding paragraph one house belonging to \nMariano Moreno, described in the first paragraph of the complaint, to Mendezona \n&amp; Co. for the sum of P2,500. At the same time and under the same execution \nthe sheriff sold seven parcels of land belonging to said Mariano Moreno, \ndescribed in the second paragraph of the complaint, to said Mendezona &amp; Co. \nfor the various sums stated in the complaint, amounting in all to P2,710. Under \nthe same execution there were also sold other lands belonging to Mariano Moreno \nand to his sureties, among them lands belonging to Amalia Moreno, those \nbelonging to the latter selling for P5,250.<\/p>\n<p>\"3. The clerk of the Court of First Instance of Manila on the 24th of June, \n1908, issued an execution upon a judgment in civil cause No. 4905 in an action \nentitled G. Urrutia &amp; Co. <em>vs<\/em>. Mariano Moreno, said judgment being \nfor the sum of P27,185.90, with interest from the 31st of July, 1906, at 9 1\/2 \nper cent per annum. Said G. Urrutia &amp; Co. presented said execution to the \nregistrar of real estate titles of the Province of Ambos Camarines on the 24th \nof July of the same year, who entered in his daily registry of property at folio \n483, entry No. 6411, the following annotation:<\/p>\n<p>\" 'Don Antonio V.

Urrutia &amp; Co. as \nplaintiff against Mariano Moreno as defendant, a judgment wherein [which] was \nentered by Judge Powell in favor of the plaintiff company; said presentation of \nsaid execution being made for the purpose of making a levy upon all of the real \nestate which according to the index of the registry of property belongs to said \nMariano Moreno, said company desiring at the same time to levy upon and attach \nthe right of redemption therein which said Mariano Moreno has according to \nsection 464 of the Code of Civil Procedure in each and every one of said parcels \nof land which appears in his name, it appearing that all of said parcels are \nannounced for public sale on the 27th of the present month.

Do\u00f1a Amalia Moreno, as surety of said Mariano Moreno, and subrogated to \nthe rights of Mendezona &amp; Co. and its successors in interest, delivered to \nthe defendant sheriff, Leon Reyes, the sum for which the lands of Mariano Moreno \ndescribed in the complaint had been sold, together with interest at 1 per cent \nper month to the 16th of June and the 22d of July, 1909, and said sheriff \nexecuted to said Amalia Moreno two documents to the effect that the said Amalia \nMoreno had redeemed the said lands as such surety and under said subrogation \nwithin the legal period.<\/p>\n<p>\"5. No other creditor of Mariano Moreno, nor any other person, has redeemed \nthe said lands described in the complaint.<\/p>\n<p>\"6. G. Urrutia &amp; Co., on its own behalf and as successors in interest to \nMendezona &amp; Co., refused to receive the sum delivered by Amalia Moreno to \nthe sheriff for the redemption of the lands of Mariano Moreno and refuses to \nrecognize the validity of such redemption and alleges that Amalia Moreno had and \nhas no right to redeem nor to retain possession of the said lands of Mariano \nMoreno, nor to be subrogated in the rights of Mendezona &amp; Co. and its \nsuccessor in interest.<\/p>\n<p>\"7. Do\u00f1a Amalia Moreno is now and has been since the month of July, 1909, in \npossession of the lands described in the complaint, pretending that she is the \nowner of the same and alleging that having been obliged to pay as surety of said \nMariano Moreno the sum of P5,796.66 for the satisfaction of the judgment against \nhim, she was subrogated in all of the rights which pertain to Mendezona &amp; \nCo. or t6 its assigns with regard to the said lands to the extent of the money \npaid by her.<\/p>\n<p>\"8. The amount paid by Amalia Moreno for the redemption of skid lands \ndescribed in the complaint is in the hands of the defendant sheriff, Leon \nReyes.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Upon this statement the learned trial court held that Amalia Moreno was \nentitled under the law to redeem the premises belonging to Mariano Moreno which \nwere sold under the judgment held by Mendezona &amp; Co. This appeal is from \nthat judgment.<\/p>\n<p>The question presented for our determination is whether or not a surety \nagainst whom a judgment has been obtained jointly with the principal can redeem \nthe real estate belonging to the principal which was sold by virtue of an \nexecution issued upon said judgment, the surety having been obliged to \ncontribute to the payment thereof.<\/p>\n<p>It does not appear from the record whether the judgment was fully satisfied \nby the sale of the properties described in the stipulation of facts. Whether it \nwas or not we do not consider important, although the claim that it was not \nperhaps gave rise to the contention that the case of Somes vs. Molina (15 Phil, \nRep., 133), is decisive of this case. Whether the judgment was fully paid by the \nsale under execution does not affect in any way the right to redeem, whereas in \nthe Somes case it was the decisive question. In that case we held that \nsubrogation rests upon purely equitable grounds and will not be enforced against \nsuperior equities; and that it ought not to be allowed to the plaintiff in that \ncase because it would work an injustice to the creditor. For the purpose of \nshowing its inapplicability to the present case, we incorporate a memorandum \nwhich, while not added as a part of the opinion in that case, was before the \ncourt and was part of the reasoning by which the final decision was reached.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Subrogation ought not to be allowed to the plaintiff because it would work \nan injustice to the creditor. The defendant Molina, in making Somes pay under \nthe appeal bond, merely took advantage of a right which Somes gave him. Can \nMolina, in thus exercising that legal right, be made to suffer in his relations \nwith De la Riva? Can one be prejudiced for rightfully taking what the law gives \nhim? No act of Molina injured Somes. If the latter has suffered any loss it is \nbecause of his own act in signing the bond in question. What Molina did was \nmerely to take advantage of a right which Somes had already given him and for \nthe exercise of which Molina had already paid a valuable and adequate \nconsideration. The bond in question, so far as Somes is concerned, is not \nwithout consideration; the consideration for the principal the consideration \nalso for the secondary obligation of Somes as surety. Molina had a right, except \nfor the intervention of the law of appeal, to take advantage of judgment No. \n3402, which he had secured against De la Riva, and proceed to collect it \nforthwith. Every presumption was in favor of its validity and he had the \nundoubted right to proceed at once to its collection,, except for the code \nprovisions relating to appeals. They provide that when a judgment-debtor shall \nappeal from the judgment against him, the judge of the court from which the \nappeal is taken may require him to give a bond, with sufficient sureties, \nconditioned that, in case the judgment is affirmed by the appellate court, he \nwill see that it is paid. This bond is required by the judge when he believes it \nnecessary for.the protection of the judgment creditor. By this provision the \njudgment-creditor, by being obliged to forbear collection of the judgment he \nhas, is deprived of. certain rights, and, in compensation for and the protection \nof those rights, he is given a bond by the judgment-debtor by which he shall be \nassured of the payment of his judgment should it be affirmed by the appellate \ncourt. AH this indicates clearly and necessarily that the law regards the \nforbearance of the judgment-creditor as a valuable and adequate consideration \nfor the obligation of the judgment-debtor and the sureties incurred under the \nbond in question. If this were not so, and, if the judgment-creditor were not, \nby his forbearance, <em>giving<\/em> a valuable consideration, then the law would \nbe giving him something for nothing, in that it would be requiring his \nprotection at the hands of the judgment-debtor and his sureties without the \njudgment-creditor doing anything to warrant it. This the law never does. That \nforbearance to prosecute a judgment to collection is a valuable and adequate \nconsideration upon which to found an obligation is recognized in the \njurisprudence of every country, and the law, in requiring a bond on appeal as a \nprerequisite to this forbearance, recognizes fully the valuable and adequate \ncharacter of such for bearance as a consideration for that bond.<\/p>\n<p>\"The result of all of this is that, when the bond is executed and the \ncreditor is obliged to forego the prosecution of his judgment, the transaction \nis closed; the creditor has paid his consideration and, as a result thereof, the \nsurety has, incurred his obligation. Now, to compel the surety to fulfill that \nobligation does not require any new consideration on the part of the \njudgment-creditor; nor does it place him under a new or additional obligation. \nThe consideration for what the surety does when he pays was given by the \ncreditor when he withheld the prosecution of his judgment, even though that was \ndone by mandate of the law. It ought to be evident that no new obligation is \nincurred by the creditor in requiring the surety to do the very thing for which \nthe original consideration was given by the creditor. Therefore, if subrogation \nis allowed in this case and the surety is permitted to share with the creditor \nin the debtor's property pro rata, we are making the creditor pay again for the \nprivilege of collecting from the surety on an obligation the consideration of \nwhich had already once been paid by the creditor. When the creditor with holds \nhis rights to collect and awaits the law's delays, and the resulting risks, for \nan opportunity to prosecute the appeal from the judgment which he has obtained \nin order that he may realize upon it, and incurs the expenses incident thereto, \nis it then just to say to him that he must divide the benefits which the law \ngives him for this waiting, this expense, and this risk, with the very man who \nhas caused it all? The weapon which the law gave the creditor for his own \nprotection ought not now to be placed in the hands of his enemies for use \nagainst him.<\/p>\n<p>\"When the creditor's obligation against the debtor is fully paid, then the \nsurety will have his subrogation to the rights of the creditor in this judgment, \nand he may then take it and collect it against the debtor whenever opportunity \nmay offer.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is evident that if subrogation is allowed in this case the creditor will \nbe injured. He has already collected judgment No. 3402 from the plaintiff's \nsurety, Somes. This he had a right to do because he had long before paid? the \nconsideration for the privilege of doing that very thing. There remains of the \njudgment-debtor's property not enough to pay the two remaining judgments now \nheld by the judgment-creditor against him. If now Somes is allowed to be \nsubrogated and share under judgment No. 3402 with the judgment-creditor in said \nproperty, pro rata, it is evident that the creditor will be injured; for, the \nproperty of the debtor, which ought to be divided between two judgments, will be \ndivided among three. Bearing in mind the fact that the creditor has already paid \nfor the privilege of making Somes pay judgment No. 3402, why should he pay again \nfor that same privilege by permitting Somes to share in property which \nrightfully belongs to him?\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This additional exposition of the Somes case shows that it is not authority \nin the case before us. Here the question is one of redemption rather than one \nbetween the creditor and the surety. The former right is granted by statute and \nits provisions define specifically and clearly the persons who are entitled to \nexercise it. Section 464 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<em>Who may redeem.<\/em>\u2014Property sold subject to redemption, as provided in \nthe last section, or any part sold separately, may be redeemed in the manner \nhereinafter provided, by the following persons, or their successors in \ninterest:<\/p>\n<p>\"1. The judgment debtor, or his successor in interest in the whole or any \npart of the property;<\/p>\n<p>\"2. A creditor having a lien by attachment, judgment, or mortgage on the \nproperty sold, or on some part thereof, subsequent to that on which the property \nwas sold.<\/p>\n<p>\"Persons mentioned in the second subdivision of this section are termed \nredemptioners.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From these provisions it is clear that in order to be able to redeem, the \ndefendant Amalia Moreno must be either the judgment-debtor or his successor in \ninterest or must hold a lien by judgment or mortgage upon the premises to be \nredeemed, <em>which lien is subsequent to the lien of the judgment under which \nthe property to be redeemed was sold.<\/em> Passing without comment the word \n\"lien,\" as it has been defined by this court, we observe instantly when we ask \nthe question whether or not the defendant Amalia Moreno falls within the first \nclass entitled under the section to redeem, that she does not fall within that \nclass unless her contribution to the payment of the judgment against her \nprincipal is sufficient in law to substitute her in the place of the \njudgment-debtor or to make her his successor in interest to the extent of \nconferring upon her the right to redeem. We are of the opinion that she does not \noccupy the place of the judgment-debtor in this or any sense. The right of \nredemption is a right belonging to the debtor and cannot be taken away from him \nwithout authorization of law. If the surety upon payment of the judgment were to \nbe substituted in his place and allowed to redeem as such, the right of the \njudgment-debtor would be thereby destroyed or, better said, would be exercised \nby another and he would be unable to exercise it thereafter himself. The surety \nhas no right directly to take the property of his principal whose debt he has \npaid or assisted in paying unless he is expressly authorized to do so by law or \nhas pursued the courses necessary under the law to that end. Courts are not \nauthorized, generally speaking, to take rights from one person and give them to \nanother without notice to the person from whom they are taken and an opportunity \nto be heard. Not being the judgment debtor or his successor in interest, in \nshort, not representing him in such a way, as to be able to exercise his right \nrelative to the redemption, defendant's claim under the first class must \nfail.<\/p>\n<p>We arrive at the same conclusion when we consider whether the defendant falls \nwithin the second class. As a general proposition it is true that when a surety \npays a judgment which has been obtained jointly against him and his principal, \nhe is subrogated to the rights of the <em>creditor<\/em> (not the \n<em>debtor<\/em>) in the judgment and may execute that judgment against his \nprincipal in the same manner and with the same effect as the creditor could have \nexecuted it; and it is a rule laid down by some courts that the judgment is kept \nalive and subsists as a lien in favor of the surety paying it. This principle of \nsubrogation, however, does not aid the surety in this case. The judgment, to the \nrights in which she is subrogated, is the <em>same judgment that the creditor \nheld.<\/em> Its lien is the same as to time. The code, however, requires, before \nthe right of redemption can be exercised, that the person who exercises it must \nbe the owner of a judgment the lien of which is <em>subsequent<\/em> to the \njudgment under which the sale of the property to be redeemed was made. This is \nthe particular provision which prevents the defendant from exercising the right \nof redemption under the second class even though we concede to her the benefits \nof the widest doctrine of subrogation. The language of the statute is plain. It \nneeds no interpretation or construction. Our duty, then, is simply to apply it. \nApplying it, we exclude the defendant from the class known as redemptioners.<\/p>\n<p>It is, therefore, adjudged that the defendant Amalia Moreno has no right to \nredeem the lands belonging to Mariano Moreno sold under judgment obtained \nagainst him by Mendezona &amp; Co. and referred to in the stipulation of facts; \nand that the attempt to redeem and all of the acts performed in relation thereto \nby said defendant are without force or effect against the plaintiff. The \njudgment is reversed, without costs in this instance.<\/p>\n<p>Nothing in this decision shall be understood as preventing Amalia Moreno from \nredeeming <em>her own lands<\/em> that were sold under execution, provided she \nhas not done so, and her right to do so still subsists.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

However this may be he advises her that he is ready \nto take possession under his contract on November 1 and to make the deposit of \n5*500 required by the contract, and that he must have the whole premises free \nand unoccupied.<\/p>\n<p>\"Consuelo Roxas sent this communication to Gan Siong a few days later with \nthe request to him that it be complied with.<\/p>\n<p>\"That on the 31st day of October, 1912, plaintiff delivered to Consuelo Roxas \nthe P500 required by his contract with her and she received it for the purpose \nindicated.<\/p>\n<p>\"That the premises were not vacated because some tenant occupying refused to \nleave. Later an action in eviction was brought against the tenant, which finally \nterminated in a dismissal of the action some days after the defendant in that \naction had voluntarily vacated on January 31, 1912.<\/p>\n<p>\"That when plaintiff had been informed by the defendant Consuelo Roxas that \nhe could have the possession of the premises on November 1 he began to prepare \nto enter into business therein, End to that end employed certain persons to \nassist him in carrying it on, and so employed a clerk, a cashier, a collector, a \nweigher, an outside man, two coolies, and a cook and kept them awaiting the time \nwhen possession of the premises would be delivered him, and thus under promises \nof delivery waited until some time in December, when he dismissed them, paying \nand promising to pay the wages agreed upon to December 31, and notified the \ndefendant Consuelo Roxas that he would no longer require the premises, she \nhaving failed to deliver possession.<\/p>\n<p>\"That the expenses thus incurred by plaintiff amount to \nP960.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There are three errors assigned by the appellants which need consideration. \nThe first one is that the court erred in finding \"that when plaintiff had been \ninformed by the defendant Consuelo Roxas that he could have the possession of \nthe premises on November 1 he began to prepare to enter into business therein \nand to that end employed certain persons to assist him in carrying it on and so \nemployed a clerk, a cashier, a collector, a weigher, an outside man, two \ncoolies, and a cook and kept them awaiting the time when possession of the \npremises would be delivered to him, and thus under promises of delivery waited \nuntil some time in December, when he dismissed them paying and promising to pay \nthe wages agreed upon to December 31, and notified the defendant Consuelo Roxas \nthat he would no longer require the premises, she having failed to deliver \npossession; that the expenses thus incurred by plaintiff amount to P960.\"<\/p>\n<p>We do not understand that in assigning this error counsel for appellants \nintended to assert that there is no evidence to sustain the findings referred \nto. Each finding is fully supported by evidence presented by the plaintiff \nhimself and other witnesses testifying in relation thereto. There is very \nlittle, if any, direct evidence to the contrary. This may be due, as counsel \nalleges, to the fact that it is difficult to meet evidence of that character. \nThis, however, does not militate against the fact that there exists such \nevidence; and if the court, in the exercise of sound judgment, accepted as true \nthe testimony of the plaintiff and his witnesses, the finding based thereon is \nnot reversible unless appellants show to the satisfaction of this court that the \ntrial court erred in making the finding. No attempt has been made to demonstrate \nsuch error except to allege that the evidence of plaintiff and his witnesses is \nuntrue. We see nothing in the record which demonstrates that such evidence is \nunreasonable or that it is false or that it suffers from\" any of the defects \nwhich must appertain to it before it can be disregarded by us after having been \npassed upon and accepted by a court who saw the witnesses, observed carefully \ntheir manner of testifying, watched their expression and conduct, and from these \nobservations made up the finding which is before us.<\/p>\n<p>The other two errors assigned relate to objections sustained by the court to \ncertain questions put by counsel for the appellants to the plaintiff when on the \nwitness stand. The first one is: \"You stated at that time, did you not, that you \nhad some laborers ready to go to work on the house?\"<\/p>\n<p>An objection was made to this question and sustained. We do not see any \nreason for sustaining the objection to the question; neither can we see that the \nexclusion of the answer in any way prejudiced the appellants' case.<\/p>\n<p>The other question is as follows: \"Is it not a fact that on the 12th of \nNovember you were a witness before the justice of the peace of the city of \nManila, in the suit of Joaquin Gan Siong <em>vs.<\/em> Tan Kee Co?\"<\/p>\n<p>This question was also objected to and the objection sustained. We are not in \na position to say that the exclusion of the answer to this question prejudiced \nthe appellants' case. It does not appear in the record what was the purpose of \nthe question. No statement was made by counsel indicating his object in \npropounding it. As the record stands before us, we can see no prejudice which \nresulted to appellants from the ruling of the court on the objection.<\/p>\n<p>That there was a breach of the contract between plaintiff and the defendant \nRoxas we regard as clearly demonstrated. According to the lease plaintiff was \nentitled to possession on the 1st day of May. Being unable to secure it at that \ntime, he was told that he could have possession in August. Again he was \ndisappointed. Following this disappointment he was told that he could have \npossession on the 1st of November. Again he was disappointed. Up to that time it \nis clear that no real effort had been made to give him possession. The premises \nwere in the possession of various other persons to whom they had been rented by \nthe defendant Roxas. They were not vacated for his possession until toward the \n1st of February of the following year. It seems unreasonable to ask that the \nlessee wait nearly nine months for possession under a lease. We can concede no \nforce to the argument that the lessor is not bound to give possession but that \nthe lessee is obliged to take the premises although occupied by another and he \nhimself obtain possession through the proper procedure in the court. In this \ncase actual possession was promised, not once tout several times.<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the damages found by the court were correctly \nfound. Plaintiff was entitled to such damages as were the direct, immediate, and \nprobable result of the breach of the contract. Appellants knew the purposes for \nwhich the plaintiff was renting the premises and, as a natural consequence, they \nwere aware of such damages as would naturally and probably result from their \nfailure to fulfill the terms of the lease. These damages have been clearly \nproved by evidence found to be credible and we can see nothing in the record \nwhich warrants interference there with.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the \nappellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

JOSE AQUINO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This case involves a claim of intervention under title of ownership for the \nrecovery of possession of a lot and a warehouse erected thereon which were sold \nat public auction by the sheriff of Nueva Ecija as though they were the property \nof Paulino Mendiola, which, according to the plaintiff intervener, they are \nnot.\n<p>The facts that occurred are the following:<\/p>\n<p>On May 9, 1904, the said sheriff publicly announced that on June 2 of the \nsame year he would sell at public auction, pursuant to a judgment rendered by \nthe justice of the peace of Cabanatuan against Paulino Mendiola and his \nproperty, a lot and a warehouse situated in Sumacab of the said municipality. \nThe description of the property is given in the notice and corresponds with that \ncontained in the complaint; it is therefore regarded as correct and here \nreproduced, for there is no question as to the identity of the property then \nsold and now demanded (Exhibit 4). At the auction Emilio Vergara was the highest \nbidder and the lot and warehouse were knocked down to him. This was on June 2, \n1904, the date announced for the sale (Exhibit 6). On February 10, 1906, Emilio \nVergara sold the said lot and warehouse acquired at auction to Maria Romares \n(Exhibit 5); and the latter, in turn, sold them, on December 29, 1910, to Jose \nAquino, their present possessor (Exhibit 7).<\/p>\n<p>From Exhibits 1 and 2 it is seen that in 1906 the lot was still assessed as \nbeing the property of Paulino Mendiola.<\/p>\n<p>The record in this case shows the following evident facts; (1) That as far \nback as 1895 the said lot was recorded in the property registry of Nueva Ecija \nin the name of the spouses Marcelino Gatchalian and Ciriaca Pascual, its owners, \nwho, on December 18, 1894, had conferred upon Mateo del Rosario power to \nadminister their property and especially to sell it, and, in the exercise of \nthis authority, Mateo del Rosario sold the lot and warehouse in question to \nPaulino Mendiola who in turn sold them to Ciriaco Bautista on August 13, 1895, \nall of which sales were recorded in the said property registry. (2) That Paulino \nMendiola, notwithstanding the sale made to Ciriaco Bautista, continued in the \npossession of the lot and warehouse, pursuant to a contract of lease executed \nbetween himself and the latter. Hence, in 1904, when the judgment of the justice \nof the peace of Cabanatuan was rendered against Mendiola, the said property was \nattached as though it still at that time belonged to him.<\/p>\n<p>However, it is not Ciriaco Bautista, the last owner recorded in the registry, \nbut Bartolome Tablante who now intervenes for the recovery of the said property. \nThe latter averred in his complaint that he purchased it from the former and\" \npresented as the only proof of such purchase his Exhibit B, which is a letter \naddressed to him by Ciriaco Bautista, couched in the following terms:<\/p>\n<p align=\"right\">\"CONCEPCION, July 6, 1908,<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Mr. BARTOLOME TABLANTE.<br\/><br\/>\"DEAR SIR: I have taken note of the contents \nof your letter to Captain Bias relative to the Sumaeab warehouse. I would inform \nyou that this warehouse belongs exclusively to me, as you will see by the titte \ndeed that you already have. I have sold it to no one else but you, nor have I, \nas regards this warehouse, any agent or authorized representative except Captain \nBias, whom I have entrusted to deliver the title deed to you. Paulino Mendiola \nbegged me to lease to him only the said warehouse, at P100 per annum; but he has \nnot fulfilled his promise and a long time has elapsed since he gave up the \nwarehouse. I hereby grant you full power to do whatever you please with the \nwarehouse as well as with the land on which it stands * * *<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p align=\"right\">(Signed) \"CIRIACO BAUTISTA.\"<\/p>\n<p>With this proof and the titles aforementioned presented by the plaintiff, \nExhibit A, the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija rendered judgment in the \ncase \"by sentencing Jose Aquino to deliver to the plaintiff, Bartolome Tablante, \nthe property in litigation and to pay to the said plaintiff the sum of P387.50 \nwith interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from this date, and to \npay the costs of this suit.\"<\/p>\n<p>The defendant appealed to this court and made the following assignments of \nerror: (1) The trial court erred in finding that the plaintiff is the owner of \nthe real properties in question; (2) the court erred in finding that the \ndefendant's possession was held in bad faith; and (3) the court erred in holding \nthat the latter was liable for losses and damages and in sentencing him to the \npayment of the sum aforesaid with interest at 6 per cont per annum from the date \nof the sentence, and the costs.<\/p>\n<p>The last two assignments of error must of course be sustained. The defendant \nwas a possessor in good faith. \"Any person who is not aware that there is in his \ntitle or in the manner of acquiring it any flaw invalidating the same shall be \nconsidered a possessor in good faith.\" (Civil Code, art. 433.) \"Good faith is \nalways presumed, and any person alleging bad faith on the part of the possessor \nis obliged to prove it;'' (Civil Code, art. 434.) The plaintiff could not have' \naverred, nor did he aver in his complaint that the defendant was a possessor in \nbad faith, and if he had made such a claim he neither produced nor attempted to \nproduce any proof whatever of possession in bad faith on the part of the \ndefendant and his predecessors. Consequently, the finding of possession in bad \nfaith and the award of damages contained in the judgment appealed from are \nentirely unfounded.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to the first assignment of error, strictly speaking it also \nshould be sustained, inasmuch as the recovery of possession was decreed in the \njudgment without having first set aside the sales consecutively made by the \nsheriff to Emilio Vergara, by Vergara to Maria Romares, and by Romares to Jose \nAquino, and without any previous pronouncement, made upon petition of one of the \nparties, that such sales were null and void. However, since an order to this \neffect may virtually be understood to be included in the recognition of \nownership in the plaintiff, this first assignment of error will be examined only \nin connection with the ground upon which it was specified by the appellant.<\/p>\n<p>This ground is no other than the averment that it was not proved at the trial \nthat the sale, though consented to by Ciriaco Bautista in favor of Bartolome \nTablante, was at any time consummated through the tradition or delivery of the \nthing sold. In fact, the ownership of things is not transferred from one person \nto another by mere consent in the contract, but through the delivery of the \nthing that is the subject of the contract. In the present case, it is admitted \nby the appellee that there was no material delivery of the lot and warehouse by \nCiriaco Bautista to Bartolome Tablante, as up to now no. proof has been \npresented of a contract of sale made between Bautista and Tablante.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the law prescribes that \"the placing of the titles of ownership \nin the possession of the vendee or the use which he may make of his right with \nthe consent of the vendor shall be considered as a delivery.\" (Civil Code, art. \n1464.) The title deeds form the plaintiff's Exhibit A, and the use of his right \nby the purchaser who in his complaint lays claim to the lot and the warehouse, \nappear to have been consented to by the vendor, by means of the aforementioned \nExhibit B. It is the same as though Ciriaco Bautista were the intervener, and if \nhe had been, there would have been no cause for discussion.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, after first declaring the sale made by the sheriff, together with \nthe subsequent ones, to be null and void, we declare Bartolome Tablante to be \nthe owner of the lot and warehouse described in the complaint, and the \ndefendant, Jose Aquino, is sentenced to restore them to the plaintiff, without \nspecial finding as to costs of both instances, affirming the judgment appealed \nfrom in so far as it is in agreement with this decision and reversing it in so \nfar as it is not.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.<\/em>, \nconcur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

That the evidence does not show beyond a reasonable doubt that the \naccused, or any of them, are guilty of the crime of robbery with homicidio,<\/p>\n<p>\"III.

About 7 o'clock at night on said date there came to \nhis house a band of robbers composed of about 20 men. Four of the members of \nthis band, armed with bolos, entered the house of Pablo Zamora, tied him and the \nother men up, made them go down outside of the house, and demanded of Pablo \nZamora where he kept his money. He replied that his daughter kept the money; the \nfour men then went back inside the house and demanded the money of the daughter, \nSotera Zamora. She gave them all the money there was in the house\u2014about P500. \nAfter looting the place and taking all the clothing they could find the robbers \nwent outside the house again where they had left Pablo Zamora and the other men \ntied and proceeded to murder them with their bolos. Witnesses state that \nGaudencio Madera attacked Pablo Zamora and Narciso Jallores attacked Sinforoso, \nIgnacio, and Juan Clerigo, and Vicente Patriarca attacked Vildo Patingo. All \nfive of these were killed and another man, Fermin de Mesa was severely wounded \nby Simeon Briones. One of the blows given to Fermin de Mesa, however, cut his \nbonds and he escaped. The robbers then left and went to the house of a neighbor \n20 or 30 meters distant, where they found Ventura de Luna with his wife. They \nkilled him and wounded another man who was going there to buy some cigarettes. \nAfter killing Ventura.de Luna they proceeded to rob the house, leaving his wife \nunharmed. The name of his wife is Dominga Pareja. There were six men killed and \ntwo wounded.<\/p>\n<p>It would appear from the evidence that there were four persons by the name of \nClerigo killed, though three only are mentioned in the complaint, the other \nbeing Irineo Clerigo; neither is the wounding of Ignacio Padis mentioned in the \ncomplaint, although he was badly wounded at the same time by the same men.<\/p>\n<p>The wife of Ventura de Luna called for help, but none came and she remained \nat the house all that night. Her husband died about midnight, she says, as a \nresult of the wounds he received.<\/p>\n<p>The wife of Pablo Zamora, his daughter, and two other women who appear to \nhave been living in the house, left there after the robbers had gone to the \nhouse of Ventura de Luna and hid themselves in the woods.<\/p>\n<p>Fermin de Mesa, who escaped when his bonds were cut by a blow from a bolo, \nhid behind the house of Ventura de Luna. That same night, after the killing, \nsome American soldiers came to the neighborhood of the occurrence and fired off \ntheir guns. This fact is clearly and conclusively established by the evidence. \nIt does not appear from the evidence, however, whether these soldiers saw the \nmurdered people, or whether they simply were in the immediate locality. The \nwitness Sotera Zamora says they were on the other side of the river from them, a \ndistance of about 20 \"brazas,\" but Juliana Sape says they came to the house and \nfired off their guns. There can be no doubt that the dead men were there, but it \nappears, so far as the alcalde was concerned, that he knew of it first from \nJuliana Sape, who told him of the occurrence on Easter Sunday morning and he \nwent to the place with the commanding officer. If the soldiers had really seen \nthe dead men, it is reasonable to suppose that a report would have been made of \nthe facts, and the lack of knowledge on the part of the alcalde would induce the \nbelief that the soldiers did not see the dead men when they visited the spot. \nThe morning following the occurrence Juliana Sape went to the town of Tigaon and \nmade a report of the occurrence to the alcalde, Senor Gregorio Natividad, who \nnotified the military authorities, and then, together with the commanding \nofficer and others, went to the place of the occurrence where they found the \ndead bodies mentioned in the complaint, as well as two people badly wounded.<\/p>\n<p>A strong effort has been made to impeach the witnesses presented by the \nprosecution, and for that reason a brief statement of the declaration of each \nwitness will be made.<\/p>\n<p>The first witness called was Juliana Sape, who testified as follows:<\/p>\n<p>That she is 42 years of age; widow of Pablo Zamora; lived in the \n<em>sitio<\/em> of Sabang Bunga, municipality of Tigaon, on the 6th of April, \n1901, when her house was sacked and her husband killed. That about 7 o'clock on \nthe night in question a band of more than 30 men came to the house for the \npurpose of robbing them; that when they arrived they immediately tied up her \nhusband, took him down below, asked him where he kept his money; he told them \nhis aughter had it. The robbers then went back into the house and obtained the \nmoney from the daughter, the money taken amounting to P500. The robbers then \nsacked the house, taking all their clothes and everything they had in the house, \nand they then turned to where they had left the men they had tied and Gaudencio \nMadera gave a \"tajo\" (bolo thrust) to her husband Pablo Zamora; Narciso Jallores \ngave a \"tajo\" to Sinforoso, Ignacio, and Juan Clerigo; and Vicente Patriarca \ngave \"tajos\" to Vildo Patingo; that after the robbers had distributed these bolo \ncuts they went to the house of a neighbor, Dominga Pareja. Juliana Sape, \ntogether with other women who were in the house, then made her escape to the \nwoods but did not stay there very long as some American soldiers came to the \nneighborhood to rescue them. Her husband was tied, she says, at the time he was \nkilled and he remained tied; that there were killed at the same time, Sinforoso, \nIgnacio, and Juan Clerigo, and Vildo Patingo; that the value of the clothes \nstolen amounted to P100 and the money stolen to P500; that P100 out of the F500 \nbelonged to her husband and the other P400 to the fishermen living there, as \ntheir share in the fishing.<\/p>\n<p>The witness further says three women were with her that night in the woods; \nthey were Sotera Zamora, her stepdaughter, Bibiana Zamora, the sister of her \nhusband, and Eusebia Clerigo, her mother, and that they were about 20 brazas \ndistant from the American soldiers when the latter fired off their guns, and \nthey were afraid to come out of the woods.<\/p>\n<p>On further examination by the fiscal she identifies Gaudencio Madera, Vicente \nPatriarca, and Narciso Jallores. She states she has known Vicente Patriarca and \nNarciso Jallores always; she was formerly afraid of making a statement but she \nis not now as the pueblo is tranquil.<\/p>\n<p>The court can see nothing in the testimony of this witness that would lead to \nany doubt of her veracity. She states that immediately after the killing she was \nfrightened. And the court considers she may well have been frightened after \nwitnessing such a night of bloodshed and terror as she had witnessed. She had \nbeen cautioned by the murderers that if she told they would follow and kill her. \nIt was a time when revolutionary parties were prowling through the country and \nshe had sufficient reason because of the threats of the robbers to keep silent. \nHer failure and refusal at the time to give the names of the assailants seem \nnatural and reasonable under all the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The next witness called by the Government was Sotera Zamora, who testified as \nfollows:<br\/><br\/>That she is 33 years of age; married, and that she is the \ndaughter of Pablo Zamora.<\/p>\n<p>Her evidence, in effect, is the same as that of Juliana Sape, her \nstepmother.<\/p>\n<p>She says there first entered the house four armed men; Gaudencio Madera, \nVicente Patriarca, Narciso Jallores, and one unknown; that they tied her father \nand took him below, and that Gaudencio Madera came back and asked her for the \nmoney. He entered a \"copete\" where he found Sinforoso Clerigo, and that, when he \nwent below he gave orders to his \"gente\" and they began to take clothing; she \ntestifies she gave Gaudencio Madera P500 which she had in a \"tampipi;\" that the \nfour men were armed with \"minasbad,\" \"palmabrava\" and \"rodelas;\" that Gaudencio \nMadera went down in front of her father and asked him where the rest of his \nmoney was and that he then gave him a bolo thrust in the breast; she states she \ndid not see the others attacked; that after she saw her father killed she was in \nsuch distress she did not know what happened; that she had seen Narciso Jallores \nenter the house and that he was armed as were the others; that after the robbers \nleft she and the other women returned to the house and they found her father \nlying dead together with others, some of whom were killed and some wounded, \nthere being three wounded.<\/p>\n<p>Fermin de Mesa, 30 years of age, was the next witness called for the \nprosecution.<\/p>\n<p>He is one of the men who was in the house of Pablo Zamora on the night of the \nrobbery and murder and was badly wounded. He has the scar of a bad wound just \nabove the elbow of his left arm which cut in very deep and seems to have cut the \nmuscles and his arm is almost useless. He has another wound on the left shoulder \nwhich apparently was very serious, and he had a third wound near the wrist.<\/p>\n<p>He testifies to practically the same facts told by Sotera Zamora. He says \nthere were more than thirty men in the gang; that four of the robbers entered \nthe house; that he knew them and he identifies all the accused in court; that \nwhen the robbers arrived they tied the people who were in the house, took them \noutside the house and then went back inside; that there were four persons \nbearing the name of Clerigo who were tied; namely, Juan, Sinforoso, Ignacio, and \nIreneo Clerigo, besides himself, Vildo Patingo, Pablo Zamora, and Venancio \nSadsad, and that Simeon Ocuang (Briones) was the one who wounded him, the \nwitness. He says that Simeon Briones first cut him on the left arm near the \nelbow and the blow that cut the arm also cut his bones, and he received two \nother wounds before he made his escape; that Gaudencio Madera wounded Pablo \nZamora and Venancio Sadsad; and Narciso Jallores wounded Sinforoso Clerigo and \nhis two sons Ignacio and Juan, but that he does not know who wounded Ireneo \nClerigo; that Vicente Patriarca wounded Vildo Patingo, and that Patingo said to \nPatriarca: \"Como, Manoy Vicente, tu vas a ser el mismo que me vas a herir?\" \n(Why! Manoy Vicente, are you yourself going to wound me?) The witness testifies \nthat after he was wounded he made his escape and hid behind the house of Ventura \nde Luna; that he intended going into the house of Ventura but that the robbers \nwent there and he heard the groans of Ventura de Luna when he was wounded by \nGaudencio Madera, and he heard Ventura say, \"Dios mio, perdonenme ya Vds. porque \nno tengo culpa, no les he faltado a Vds. y me estan hiriendo!\" (For God's sake, \nspare me! I am not to blame, I haven't done anything to you, and you are \nwounding me!); that all the parties were armed; that after the attack and after \nthe robbers had left, he went into the house of Ventura and there spent the \nnight.<\/p>\n<p>The next witness is Ignacio Padis; 38 years old; laborer. He testifies he \nknew Pablo Zamora and Ventura de Luna; that on the 6th of April, 1901, he went \nto the house of Ventura de Luna for the purpose of buying some cigarettes, \ncoming from his own house which is distant from the place; that when he neared \nthe house of Ventura de Luna the place was assaulted; that he knew they were \n\"asaltantes\" because they wounded him with their bolos. Witness shows one wound \nin the middle of his breast which evidently had cut deep into the bone; the \nwound is about 6 inches long. He has another wound on the top of the right \nshoulder about 2 inches long. Both wounds must have been very severe ones. He \nsays Gaudencio Madera was the man who wounded him and he identifies audencio \nMadera in court. He says he saw only three robbers, Vicente Patriarca, Narciso \nJallores, and Gaudencio Madera; that he did not see the robbers at all until \nthey assaulted him; that he does not know why they wounded him, because he \nsimply said \"buenas noches.\" When he received the wounds he escaped into the \n\"nipales\" a distance of about 40 brazas from the house of Ventura; that when he \nwas wounded Ventura de Luna was in front of Gaudencio Madera and that the latter \nwounded Ventura. It was some time after 7 o'clock when the occurrence took \nplace; that there was a moon and the night was very clear. He testifies he has \nknown Narciso Jallores, Vicente Patriarca, and Gaudencio Madera for a number of \nyears; that he made a declaration before the justice of the peace of Tigaon on \nthe 11th of January of this year, and also one before the justice of the peace \nof Goa on the following day, and that he made this second declaration because he \nhad not finished his declaration before the justice of the peace of Tigaon; that \nhe was taken to the town of San Jose by the Americans after the killing, but \nthat he was not asked anything about the occurrence because he was \"muy mal de \nsalud\" (in very bad health); that he left San Jose before he was fully cured and \nstayed in Tigaon.<\/p>\n<p>The next witness called is Dominga Pareja, widow of Ventura de Luna. She says \nshe is 80 years of age and lives in Tigaon. She is an old woman, but her mind \nappears clear.<\/p>\n<p>She testifies that on the 6th of April, 1901, she was in Sabang Bunga, \nmunicipio of Tigaon; that she did not have a house there but that she was \nstaying in a house and living with her husband Ventura de Luna; that she does \nnot know in what year her husband was killed because she is an old woman and \nmuch time has passed since the occurrence; that she remembers that her husband \nwas killed by Gaudencio Madera who gave her husband a \"tajo\" (bolo thrust); that \nshe knows Gaudencio Madera (whom she identifies in the court room); that her \nhusband went out to see who was calling him, and as she heard him cry out, she \nwent out and the robbers had already wounded him once; that she did not see her \nhusband receive the first wound but she saw him given a bolo stroke in the right \nleg and a wound on the right shoulder just above the lung; that after they had \nkilled her husband they made her go down stairs, then they tied her and took her \nback into the house and then proceeded to take their clothing. She says the \nvalue of the clothing taken was about P30 as she was not rich, and that the \nrobbers also took P10 in money; that they did not stay long in her house but \nthey stayed long enough to eat up her rice. She states her house was 20 meters \ndistant from the house of Pablo Zamora; that after the robbers left she shouted \nfor help but none came; that she did not give an account of the occurrence to \nthe authorities because she was. very weak and there was nothing she could do; \nthat she knows Gaudencio Madera because he had been \"teniente\" of the \"sitio of \nMoriones\" in the Spanish times and that he had sometimes questioned them when \nthey were carrying rice; that she heard Ignacio Padis whistling and heard the \nrobbers ask him where he was going and he said he was coming to buy some \ncigarettes, and then they gave him bolo cuts and he escaped; that she does not \nknow who cut Ignacio Padis because she was inside the house and he was in front \nof her house; that she heard no noise in the house of Pablo Zamora, because she \nis half deaf; that there were at that time revolutionary bands, and that this \nband was such a one; that Gaudencio Madera was a revolutionary soldier and that \nhe was chased by the Americans.<\/p>\n<p>Antonio Dinido, a \"montes\" 28 years old, is the next witness for the \nprosecution. He is called an \"Igorrote\" part of the time and sometimes he is \nmentioned as a \"Negrito,\" but he is neither one nor the other. He is simply a \nbaptized wild-tribe man.<\/p>\n<p>It was attempted in his cross-examination to show that he was not 28 years of \nage and that he was born in 1888. From his appearance the court considers that \nhe is at least 28 years of age. The court informed the attorneys for the defense \nthat if they wished they could procure his certificate of baptism and present \nthe same. However, it was not put in. If this witness had been born in 1888 he \nwould have been only 13 years of age at the time this crime was committed in \n1901.<\/p>\n<p>He testifies he is a \"montes;\" that he does not know the sitio of Sabang \nBunga because he did not grow up in that locality; but that he has heard the \nname; that he did not know Pablo Zamora nor Ventura de Luna because he did know \nthe \"gente\" in that locality. He was then asked if he knew the prisoners; he \nsaid \"yes\" and identified each one of them; he says he accompanied them when \nthey did the killing; that they killed seven persons. Asked if they wounded \nthem, he says \"no, they killed them;\" that he knows this because he accompanied \nthem when they did it; he insists that there were seven people killed. He says \nthat Gaudencio Madera, Capitan Narciso Jallores, and Vicente Patriarca passed by \nthe \"sitio\" of Moriones and Gaudencio Madera told him to follow them. He asked \nwhere they were going and the reply was simply to follow them; that he was \nafraid and he went. When they got to the \"sitio\" of Sabang Bunga they assaulted \ntwo houses, tied the persons and carried them down below and wounded them. He \nsays they killed seven, but he does not know their names. Asked when the \noccurrence took place, he replied it occurred when the Americans came; he says \nthey did not give him any of the spoils; that after the assault they went away; \nthat he returned to Moriones; that there were 19 in the assaulting party\u20143 from \nthe town, the rest of them being Igorrotes. Those who were not Igorrotes were \nGaudencio Madera, Narciso Jallores, and Vicente Patriarca. He says he has no \nenmity against any of the accused. Asked on cross examination if he knew why \nSimeon Briones (alias Ocuang) was accused and not himself, he replied that it \nwas because Briones had done some of the killing and he had not.<\/p>\n<p>He states he heard about the arrest of the parties and he went to inform \nLieutenant Yance of the Constabulary at Goa of what he knew of the affair; that \nhe did not tell him before this because the crime had not been discovered; that \nhe knows the names of his other companions and that he gave these names to \nLieutenant Yance when he went and told what he knew of the occurrence; that he \nwas told he was 28 years old by his \"padrino.\" He says further that there were \nbands of \"insurrectos\" in those times, and that this band was such a one; that \nGaudencio Madera was the \"teniente\" of the band and \"Capitan Narciso\" was the \n\"comandante,\" but that he does not know what office Vicente Patriarca held; that \nhe, witness, was not a soldier as he only carried a short knife and that he was \nonly small then; he does not know how old he was, but he was very small; that he \nwas not a muchacho, nor was he a soldier, he was simply told to follow them, and \nthat they got him from the sitio of Moriones, within the jurisdiction of Pili; \nthat nobody told him the accused had been carried to Nueva Caceres; he knew it \nsimply because of \"noticias;\" that he did not talk with anyone about the case \nbefore he was called to testify. He was then asked if he was a muchacho for \nJuliana Sape and Sotera Zamora, and he denied ever having been their muchacho; \nthat he did not know them nor had he ever entered their house; that nobody sent \nto call him to testify before the court, but that he came of his own volition; \nthat he came to Tigaon at 5 o'clock on the afternoon of the day preceding the \ntrial; that he slept below the court, in the \"tribunal,\" having been told to go \nthere to sleep by Lieutenant Yance; that nobody told him he was to testify but \nthat he knew he was to testify before he left Moriones though he had not \nreceived any subpoena, Benita Saludo, 60 years of age, was the next witness \ncalled. She states that her occupation in the year 1901 was that of \"lavandera\" \nand that she was called upon by Gaudencio Madera to wash a coat of his which was \ncovered with<br\/>blood; and that this was on Easter Sunday in the year 1901.<\/p>\n<p>It is difficult to find a case where the culpability of the defendants is \nmore clearly proved, if we accept the declarations of the witnesses for the \nprosecution, than the present. The attorney for the appellants calls our \nattention to many circumstances which, under ordinary conditions would discredit \nthe veracity of some of the witnesses for the prosecution. For example, the \ncrime was committed on the night of the 6th of April, 1901, and the complaint \nwas not presented until the month of January, 1913. Practically all of the \nwitnesses for the prosecution were present and saw the defendants and recognized \nthem on the night when the alleged crime was committed. Some of them admit that \nthey reported to the authorities the next morning the fact that the crime \ndescribed in the complaint had been committed. At that time they failed to give \nthe authorities the names of the perpetrators. They now explain why they did not \ngive the names of the perpetrators of the crime to the authorities. They say \nthat public order in the community where they lived was very much disturbed by \nthe existence of a revolution. That the American army had just arrived in the \nlocality. That they were ignorant and were just as much afraid of the American \nsoldiers as they were of the \"malhechores.\" And, furthermore, they now say that \nthe defendants threatened to pursue and to kill them, if they divulged their \nnames to the authorities. Some of the witnesses for the prosecution evidently \nbelieved that the authorities would be able to ascertain who the defendants were \nwithout their giving their names. The attorney for the appellants also \ncriticizes the prosecution for the long delay between the time of the commission \nof the offense and the actual presentation of the complaint. That, of course, \nunder ordinary circumstances, would be suspicious. Article 131 of the Penal \nCode, however, provides that a criminal action, such as the present, may be \ncommenced within any time within a period of twenty years. The fact that the \nprosecution did not commence the action earlier, while it is suspicious, \nnevertheless is not conclusive that the facts stated in the complaint are not \ntrue. The attorney for the appellants further calls our attention to the fact \nthat even during the preliminary examination, the declaration of some of the \nwitnesses was different before the justice of the peace from their declaration \nin the Court of First Instance. There are many circumstances which tend to show \nthat the preliminary examination was not conducted with that degree of \nimpartiality which should characterize such proceedings. Furthermore, two of the \nwitnesses swore positively that the justice of the peace refused to hear them \nupon certain matters upon which they desired to declare. One of the witnesses \nwho had been refused the right to make a full, free, and open statement before \nthe justice of the peace, went before another authority and completed his \nstatement. The mere fact, however, that a witness declares to certain facts \nduring a preliminary examination and to another set of facts upon the trial of \nthe cause in the Court of First Instance, does not necessarily discredit his \ntestimony nor destroy it, if such contradictions are satisfactorily explained. \n(U. S. vs. Magtibay, 17 Phil. Rep., 417.) In the present case we are not \ninclined to permit the contradictions made by some of the witnesses in their \ndeclarations before the justice of the peace and in the Court of First Instance \nto discredit their testimony because, in our opinion, such contradictions were \nfully explained by the witnesses themselves, during their examination at the \ntrial of the cause.<\/p>\n<p>There were many witnesses presented by the defense, some of whom were more or \nless interested in the outcome of the action, whose declarations tend to \nexculpate the defendants. The lower court, however, after having seen and heard \nthem and weighing their testimony with that of the testimony offered by the \nprosecution, found that the declarations of the witnesses for the prosecution \nwere to be believed rather than the declarations of the witnesses for the \ndefense. While as we said above, the fact that some of the witnesses for the \nprosecution who were present at the time and place where the crime was \ncommitted, on the very next morning failed to give the names of the perpetrators \nto the authorities might, under other circumstances discredit their \ndeclarations, yet, nevertheless, considering all of the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding the commission of the present crime, together with the fact that an \ninsurrection existed in the locality, and also the fact that their testimony \ngiven during the trial of the present cause is corroborated in practically all \nof the details by the declarations of other witnesses, we find no reason now for \nnot accepting their testimony as true.<\/p>\n<p>There were many aggravating circumstances connected with the commission of \nthe crime. The crime was committed at nighttime, by a band composed of from \ntwenty to thirty men. All of the facts surrounding the commission of the crime \nindicate that the defendants selected the nighttime for the purpose of more \neffectually committing their crime. The crime was committed in the house of the \noffended persons. Before the four persons described in the complaint were \nkilled, they were manacled and were killed while they were manacled. The \ndefendants not only committed the crime of assassination with the qualifying \ncircumstance of <em>alevosia<\/em>, together with the aggravating circumstances \nof nocturnity and <em>morada,<\/em> but they also committed the crime of robbery, \nmaking them clearly guilty of the crime of assassination with robbery. They \nshould, therefore, be punished in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 \nof article 503,in relation with article 502 of the Penal Code. The lower court \ngave the defendants the benefit of article 11 of the Penal Code, compensating \nall of the aggravating circumstances by said article. The Solicitor-General, in \na very carefully prepared brief, undertakes to demonstrate that the defendants, \nby reason of their character and intelligence, are not entitled to the benefit \nof said article 11, as amended by Act No. 2142. We are very much inclined to \nagree with this conclusion of the Solicitor-General.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, in view of the foregoing facts, the sentence of the lower court \nmust be modified, and considering the aggravating circumstances above mentioned, \nthe said defendants Gaudencio Madera, Narciso Jallores and Vicente Patriarca \nmust be sentenced in the maximum degree of the penalty provided for in paragraph \n1 of article 503 of the Penal Code, or with the penalty of death, and each of \nthem is hereby condemned jointly and severally to pay to the heirs of Pablo \nZamora the sum of Pl,000, and to indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of \nVentura de Luna in the sum of P1,000; to indemnify, jointly and severally, the \nheirs of each of the deceased Vildo Patingo, Sinforoso Clerigo, Juan Clerigo, \nand Ignacio Clerigo in the sum of P1,000, and that they return to the heirs of \nPablo Zamora the. sum of P250, the value of the clothes and money robbed from \nhim; that they also return to the heirs of Ventura de Luna the sum of P25, the \nvalue of the clothes robbed from him, and each to pay one-fourth part of the \ncosts.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Juez John P. Weissenhagen condeno a \nPonciano Cabilit en la pena de muerte y a Balbino Oleras en la de cadena\n perpetua, en la indemnizacion mancomunada y solidaria de mil pesos a \nlos herederos del occiso, en las accesorias y en las costas por mitad, \ndeclarandose en comiso el bolo y la navaja instrumentos del delito, de \ncuya sentencia no consta que hayan apelado los acusados.\n<p>En la ma\u00f1ana del 24 de Noviembre de 1913, halandose Simplicio Costa \nsentado dentro de su casa, situada en el pueblo de Burawen, Leyte, cerca\n de la escalera, teniendo en sus brazos a un hijo suyo de corta edad, de\n improviso penetro en la casa Ponciano Cability enseguida sin decir \npalabra alguna descargo con el bolo que llevaba un tajoen la cabeza del \nCosta, quien estaba desprevenido y no sospechaba que habia de ser \nagredido, cuyo golpe le produjo una herida grave de caracter mortal en \nla region pariental izquierda interesando el encefalo de dicha region: \nque la mujer del agredido Serafina Asido al ver la agresion se dirigio a\n Balbino Oleras que tambien subio a la casa en compania del agresor \nCability y le suplico que intercadiera cerca del Cabilit o defendiese a \nsu marido, para que no repitiera la agresion, pero Oleras en vez de \nobrar como solicitara la esposadel agredido, echo mano de un cuchillo \nque tenia y a su vez acomatio al occiso dando a este una punalada en el \npecho cerca del estomaga: que en esto se levanto el agredido Costa y \nbajo de casa para escaparse; pero sus agresores le persiguieron \nhiriendole en otras partes del cuerpo hasta que cayo tendido y muerto en\n tierra, lo cual visto poe la viuda y una hija de 12 anos de edad del \ninterfecto Agripina Costa salieron y huyeron de la casa perseguidas por \nlos acusados, los cuales no. prosiguiron la proseccusion al ver que las \nofendidas consiguieron refugiarse en la casa vecina; anadiendo en su \ndeclaracion la viuda del occiso que el motivo del crimen se debio a \nhabar prevenido a Ponciano Cabilit el dia anterior que se abstuviera \neste de extraer jugo llamado tuba de sus arboles cocales, en razon a que\n Cabilit no. cumplia en pagar por los beneficios que obtenia de dicho \njugo. Asi resulta de las declaraciones de la esposa e hija menor de edad\n del occiso, cuyas daclaraciones aparecen confirmadas por Cornelia Rael,\n duena de la casa vecina, situada frente a la de la ocurrencia, desde \ncuya ventana vio y presencio la misma la agresion ejecutada por los \nacusados en la persona del interfecto, su persecucion y lo demas \nsucedido en la casa de este.<\/p>\n<p>Segun reconocimiento practicado por el Medico Sr. Wenceslao Enage se \nencontraron en el cadaver del occiso siete heridas y pequenas lesiones \nen diferentes partes del cuerpo, de las cuales dos de aquellas eran de \nconsideracion, de caracter grave y mortal que son la herida de la region\n parietal izquierda que intereso el encefalo, y la del lado izquierdo al\n nivel de la union del hueso external con los cartilagos y costillas, de\n las cuales la quinta y la sexta quedaron seccionadas; otra herida en la\n region escapulgar que corto totalmente la base de este hueso; otra en \nel vacio izquierdo y otra debajo de la misma y tambien otras dos en el \nbrazo izquierdo y en la region lumbar en su oarte media, siendo graves y\n de caracter mortal la herida en la region parietal y la del lado \nizquierdo del pecho.<\/p>\n<p>Habiendo adquirido caracter firme la sentencia consul tada respecto \nde Balbino Oleras, se ocupara esta decision solamente del resultado de \nla causa con relacion al acusado Ponciano Cabilit, sentenciado a la pena\n de muerte.<\/p>\n<p>Este acusado no se declaro culpable, aunque admitio que infirio \nalgunas heridas a Simplicio Costa, alegando en su defensa que se \nconstituyo en casa del mismo a cobrar cierta cantidad que este le debia y\n entonces Costa enfadado le dio de puntapies y le acometio con un bolo, \ncuya arma pudo sin embargo arrebatar, pero como Costa insistiera en \nacometerle, al verse en peligro no. obstante su retirada, hubo de darle \nun golpe con dicho bolo, de cuyas resultas Costa quedo tendido en el \nsuelo y muerto en el acto. Esta exculpacion no. aparece apoyada por \nninguna clase de prueba.<\/p>\n<p>Alegase por la defensa del acusado que este solo cometio el delito de\n homicido con la circunstancia atenuante de arrebato y obcecacion; pero \nlos datos de cargo y demasmeritos que de la causa resultan, prueban por \nmodo decisivo y terminante que el hechode la muerte violenta de \nSimplicio Costa, reviste caracteres del delito de asesinato, previsto y \ncastigado en el Art. 403 del Codigo penal, pues que las daclaraciones de\n los tres testigos presenciales de lo ocurido prueban de una manera \nconcluyente y fuera de toda duda que Simplicio Costa fue acometido \nalevosamente por los acusados infiriendoles varias heridas, algun as de \nellas graves y mortales de necesidad.<\/p>\n<p>El hecho de haber sido atacada de un modo brusco, repentino e \ninmotivado una persona inerme que descuidada no pudo preveer la \nagresion, ni le fue posible defenderse o al menos huir y librarse del \nsubito ataque fue victima, es indudablemente constitutivo del delito de \nasesinato por la concurrencia de la circunstancia cualificativa de \nalevosia que es la segunda de las enumeradas en el citado Art. 403 del \nCodigo, pues que Simplicio sentado tranquilamente en el suelo de su casa\n con su pequeno hijo en sus brazos sin motivo ni, precedente alguno y \nsin haber visto previamente el comienzo de la agresion, de repente \nrecibio un golpe y se sintio herido en la cabeza y acto seguido otro \ngolpe en el lado izquierdo del pecho, por lo que es innegable que los \ndos agresores obraron sobreseguro y a traicion y con abuso de \nsuperioridad, toda vez que continuaron acometiendole hasta dajarle \ncompletamente muerto en tierra y fuera de su casa a donde fue perseguido\n al huir el occiso.<\/p>\n<p>Esta circunstancia cualificativa aparece debidamente justificada en \nel proceso por las declaraciones de las mismas testigos que vieron y \npresenciaron el hecho principal desde el comienzo de la agresion por \nparte de los procesados Cabilit y Oleras hasta que quedo tendido y \nmuerto el occiso en tierra y fuera de su casa de la cual habia huido de \nsus agresores, sin que pueda admitirse como cierto 1o alegado por el \nacusado Cabilit de que en defensa propia hubo de herir gravemente y dar \nmuerte al occiso por absoluta carencia de prueba de su inverosimil \nalegacion, la cual aparencia de prueba de su inverosimil alegacion, la \ncual aparece desde luego desmentida por las unicas testigos \npresencialles de todo lo ocurrido.<\/p>\n<p>En la comision del delito se debe aprecir la concurrencia de la \ncircunstancia agravente 20.<sup>a<\/sup> Art. 10 del Codigo, por haberse \nejecutado el delito en la morada del interfacto, estimandose embebida la\n de abuso de superioridad en la mencionada cualficativa de alevosia, sin\n que conste por lo demas que haya concurrido la cualificativa de \npremeditacion por falta de actos ostensibles que denotaran deliberacion \nreflexiva para perpetrar el crimen, y quedando compensada en sus efectos\n la citada agravante generica por la especial establecida en el Art. 11 \ndel Codigo, segun reforma establecida en la Ley No. 2142, y por tanto la\n pena a que se ha hecho acreedor el acusado Cabilit, debe serle impuesta\n en el grado medio.<\/p>\n<p>Por estas consideraciones proceda que con revocacion de la sentencia \nconsultada en la parte referente a Ponciano Cabilit, se debe condenar a \neste como le condenamos en la pena de cadena perpetua, en las \naccessorias 2<sup>a<\/sup> y 3<sup>a<\/sup> del Art. 54 del Codigo, en la \nindemnizacion mancomunada y solidaria con Balbino Oleras de la cantidad \nde mil pesos a la viuda y herederos del occiso y en las costas de esta \ninstancia, quedando en comiso y en las costas de esta instancia, \nquedando en comiso las armas instrumento del delito.<\/p>\n<p>Trascurridos diez dias desde la notificacion de esta decision, \ndictese sentencia a tenor de lo resuelto y diez dias despues, devuelvase\n la causa al Juzgado de su procedencia para los efectos a que en derecho\n hubiere lugar.<\/p>\n<p>Asi se ordena.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, J., Johnson, J., Carson, J., Moreland, J.,<\/em> and <em>Araullo,\n J.<\/em><\/p><\/div>",

Francisco \nLamiel, el mismo ha dicho que no presento desde entonces su denuncia, porque su \ntestigo se negaba entonces a testificar, manifestacion que, por otra parte, \ndemuestra la verdad del hecho denunciado, pues de ella se deduce que solo al \ncontar el denunciante con Agustin Taduran que vio por sus propios ojos como \nvivian Feliza Bulalacao y el chino Tiong Singco en el almacen de este desde \nOctubre de 1912, se decidio a formular aquella.<\/p>\n<p>Por lo demas, aunque Anselmo Silva con su silencio hubiese tolerado o \nconsentido por algun tiempo los actos de adulterio ejecutados en su agravio por \nla acusada, no estarian por este motivo los acusados exentos de responsibilidad \ncriminal, segun lo ha declarado ya esta Corte Suprema en el asunto EE.

y otro que en compensacion, los \ndemandados se obligaban solidariamente a pagar hasta el l.0 de Enero de 1909 a \nla demandante 1,400 pesos filipinos; \"quedando afectos a la responsabilidad de \neste pago los mismos bienes reclamados en la demanda . . . \" y mientras no \npuedan efectuar el pago durante el plazo convenido no podran enagenar, gravar ni \nhipotecar dichos bienes ni hacer en ellos acto cualquiera que perjudique al \nderecho de la demandante a pedir luego su ejecucion.,\" 4.0 que llego el plazo \nestipulado y los demandados no cumplieron esta obligacion, por lo que la \ndemandante en 29 de Marzo de 1909 pidio la ejecucion del convenio aprobado \njudicial mente y la expedicion del oportuno mandamiento para el efecto.\n<p>En 13 de Mayo de 1909, el Juzgado ordeno la expedicion del mandamiento de \nejecucion ordenando la entrega a la demandante de todos los bienes reclamados en \nla demanda o sea la ya expresada casa de tabla dentro de la poblacion de Vigan y \nlas sementeras en la jurisdiccion de Santa Cruz.<\/p>\n<p>Un delegado del Sheriff fue a la casa de tabla de los demandados en la \npoblacion de Vigan en 19 de Mayo de 1909; mas la encargada que se hallaba en \nella Martina Fernandiz se nego a recibir la notificacion, manifestando que \ntambien ella tenia parte en la casa (Ibid. 119).<\/p>\n<p>En 22 de Mayo de 1909, Jorge Nolasco comparecio en la oficina del Sheriff \npresentando un escrito de tenceria en el que por si y en representacion de sus \nhermanas reclamaba como stiya una sexta parts de dicha casa y solar \"en que se \nhabia trabado ejecucion\", y el Sheriff devolvio al escribano del Juzgado el \nmandamiento de posesion y el escrito de Jorje Nolasco, los cuales el escribano \nhace constar haber recibido.<\/p>\n<p>En 22 de Diciembre de 1909, se procedio a la ejecucion sobre las sementeras \nen el municipio de Santa Cruz, y tambien salio con un escrito Manuela Joven \nmanifestando que no todas eran de la propiedad de Batolorme y Tarsila Nolasco, \npues que parte correspondia a unas cinco hijas suyas, no obstante lo cual en 7 \nde Enero de 1910 se puso en posesion de ellas al representante de Marcelina \nPablo; con lo que el Sheriff devolvio diligenciado al Juzgado el mandamiento de \nejecucion dandose por recibido por el escribano.<\/p>\n<p>La ejecutante presento un escrito pidiendo al Juzgado que se declarara sin \nlugar a las oposiciones de Martina Fernandiz, Jorge Nolasco y Manuela Joven, y \nel Juzgado por providencia de 12 de Febrero de 1910 ordeno que se expidiera \nnuevo mandamiento de ejecucion previniendo al Sheriff que se atuviera en su \ncumplimiento a los preceptos del Cap. 19 de la Ley de Procedimientos \nciviles.<\/p>\n<p>En 15 de Pebrero y 7 de Marzo de 1910, se dio posesion a la ejecutante \nrespectivamente de la casa de tabla en la poblacion de Vigan y de un terreno en \nel sitio Quembay de la jurisdiccion de Santa Cruz.<\/p>\n<p>La Martina Fernandiz, ya no suscito oposicion alguna.<\/p>\n<p>El Jorge Nolasco, tampoco; pero en su lugar salio un Marcos Nolasco haciendo \nigual reclamacion que aquel otro; \".pero - dice el delegado del Sheriff - que \nesta terceria carece de los requisitos legales que marca el art.o 451 del Codigo \nde procedimientos civiles, sin perjuicio de prevenir al referido Sr. Marcos \nNolaseo el derecho que tiene de acudir ante quien corresponda para la decision \ndel hecho.\"<\/p>\n<p>Terminada asi la ejecucion, los expresados individuos presentaron al Juzgado \ndemanda por danos y perjuicios en la cantidad de 3250 pesos contra el Sheriff y \ncontra la ejecutante Marcelina Pablo, por haberse llevado a efecto aquella a \npesar de las tercerias interpuestas mediante las cuales trataban de excluir la \nmitad de los bienes dados en posesion a la ejecutante, que alegaban ser \nsuyos.<\/p>\n<p>Y tal es la materia de la presente oausa No. 714 de aquel Juzgado.<\/p>\n<p>Desestimada la demanda por el Juzgado con las costas a los demandantes, \napelaron estos.<\/p>\n<p>Los fundamentos de la desestimacion son: respecto de la terceria de Jorje \nNolasco y Marcos Nolasco, (que es una misma), el de haber si do presentada \ndespues de terminada la ejecucion; y cuanto a la de Manuela Joven, el de haber \nsido presentada sin la solemnidad del Juramento; anadiendo el Juzgado, en su \ndecision, que tal vez podrian tener los demandantes derecho a las cosas que han \nsido objeto de ejecucion, y una demanda reivindicatoria contra la actual \nposeedora acaso podria prosperar; pero que no habiendo sido objeto de litigio ni \nsometido al juicio del Juzgado semejante derecho, se abstiene de fallar acerca \nde el<\/p>\n<p>Es cierto. No es caso ahora de resolver si Jorje Nolasco y Marcos Nolasco \ntienen derecho a una mitad de la casa de Vigan, como afirman en uno de los \npuntos de hecho de su demanda, o a una sexta parte solamente, como dijeron en \nsus escritos llamados de terceria de 1909 y 1910, y si tambien tienen parte en \nuna mitad de las sementeras que para sus hijas reclamaba Manuela Joven. No ha \nversado el pleito sobre ninguno de estos puntos. Es solamente objeto de este \nJuicio si el ecto del Sheriff de llevar a efecto la ejecucion no obstante \naquellos escritos de los tres ahore demandantes fue ilegal. Nada tiene que ver \ncon este acto del Sheriff la ejecutante Marcelina Pablo, y no debio ser \ndemandada.<\/p>\n<p>Los hechos probados son: 1.o que Jorje Nolasoo presento simplemente un \nescrito reclemando una sexta parte en la casa de Vigan, escrito que el Sheriff \nelevo al Juzgado para su resolucion, y el Juzgado resolvio mandando que \nprocediera de nuevo a ejecutar la expresade casa, ateniendo se el Sheriff a lo \npreceptuado en la ley: 2.0 que igual procedimiento adopto en orden a los \nescritos presentados por Marcos Nolasco y Manuela Joven, cuanto a una mitad de \nlas sementeras de Santa Cruz, esta ultima.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"No sera valida - dice la ley - la reclamacion que por dicha propiedad \nembargada se intentare contra aquel funcionario (el Sheriff), ni sera recibida, \nni admitida como notificacion de cualquier derecho contra el, a menos que se \npresentare conforme a lo prescrito en este articulo.\" (451 de la ley No. 190). \nLo prescrito en este articulo es de este tenor: \"Una persona puede entablar \nterceria Sobre bienes embargados que pretenda como suyos, mediante reclamacion \npor escrito y bajo juramento con expresion de su titulo y derecho de posesion y \nlos fundamentos de aquel (del titulo) que presentara al Gobernador, delegado de \neste u otro funcionario que ejecute el embargo.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>No habiendo presentado al Sheriff que ejecuto el embargo ni Marcos Velasco ni \nJorje Velasco los fundamentos de su titulo ora sobre una mitad ora sobre una \nsexta parte de la casa y solar de Vigan, ni Manuela Joven los fundamentos del \ntitulo ora de sus hijas ora de ella y de sus hijas sobre la mitad de las \nsementeras en el municipio de Santa Cruz, es evidente que no presentaron sus \ntercerias \"conforme a lo prescrito en este articulo.\" Por consiguiente, \"no \ndebio ser recibida, ni admitida como notificacion de cualquier derecho contra el \nla presente reclemacion que por las expresadas propiedades se ha intentado \ncontra el Sheriff demandado .<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Nada de lo dispuesto aqui - asi termina la ley - privara a dicho tercero que \nhaga valer en el juicio correspondiente su derecho sobre los bienes \nembargados.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>El Sheriff no obro ilegalmente al proceder del modo que procedio.<\/p>\n<p>La decision del Juzgado a quo estuvo en su lugar, por esta razon.<\/p>\n<p>Se confirma la sentencia apelada con las costas a los apelantes.<\/p>\n<p>Veinte dias despues dictese sentencia, y a los diez<\/p>\n<p>de dictada, procedase a la devolucion consiguiente.<\/p>\n<p>Asi se ordena.<\/p>\n<p>CONFORMES:<br\/><br\/><em>Gomez, J., Johnson, J., Carson J., Moreland J.,<\/em> \nand <em>Araullo JJ.<\/em> <br\/><\/p><\/div>",

I., received several amounts for the purchase of native hats, from \nwhich amounts on the date above stated, there was a balance in his possession of \nP1,036.11, which the said Rosendo Villareal had received on deposit, commission \nor administration from the said firm, Successors of C. Fressel &amp; Co., to \nwit, for the purpose of buying native hats for the said firm of Successors of C. \nFressel &amp; Co., the said defendant did then and there wilfully, unlawfully \nand feloniously misappropriate, misapply and convert to his own use the said sum \nof P1,036.11, to the damage and prejudice of the said firm of Successors of C. \nFressel &amp; Co. in the said sum of P1,036.11, Philippine currency, equivalent \nto 5,180 and 11\/20 pesetas.\"<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that there is not sufficient evidence to sustain the \nconviction. It appears from the testimony introduced on the trial that the firm \nof Successors of C. Fressel &amp; Co. was engaged in the purchase and export of \nnative hats of various styles and qualities. Thus engaged it procured the \nservices of the accused in this case to purchase hats of the individual makers \nfound engaged in that business within a certain area and to sell them to the \ncompany. It was the custom among the hat makers at that time to have advanced to \nthem by their purchasers money sufficient to pay for materials and help. The \ndefendant having no money to make these advances and to pay for the hats which \nhe had engaged to purchase, certain sums were at various times advanced to him \nby C. Fressel &amp; Co. In return for the advances the accused at various times \nsold and delivered to the company quantities of hats at an agreed price. In the \ncourse of time and just prior to the commencement of this prosecution a \nliquidation of accounts resulted in disclosing the fact that the accused was in \ndebt to Fressel &amp; Co.for money advanced in the sum of P1,036.11.<\/p>\n<p>It appears from the testimony of Brokman, the manager of Fressel &amp; Co., \nas well as from the testimony of the accused, that the money advanced to the \naccused by Fressel &amp; Co. was in the nature of a loan and not a delivery of \nmoney to be used for a particular purpose or to be returned. Brokman testified \nthat they purchased hats from the defendant at the price which they could agree \nupon; that an account was kept of the debits and credits of the accused in which \nhe was charged with the sums of money advanced and credited with varying \nquantities of hats which he delivered to them; that the sum of P1,036.11 which \nappears as the balance in favor of the company did not represent any particular \nor designated sum of money advanced to the accused' but was obtained by \nsubtracting from the total of the sums advanced the total purchase price of the \nhats delivered. The accused testified that the money which he had from the \nplaintiffs was received as a loan which was charged to his account and which he \npromised to repay in hats which he proposed to sell and deliver to them. He \nadmitted that he owed the sum above mentioned but denied that he had used any \nmoney obtained from the company for his own purposes as alleged, declaring that \nthe sum represented the losses which he had sustained in the business occasioned \nby two causes; First, the neglect or refusal of certain hat makers to whom the \naccused had advanced considerable sums of money to deliver to him the hats for \nthe purchase price of which said sums had been delivered; and, second, the \ncompany at various times during their commercial relations refused to pay the \naccused the price which he asked for the hats and compelled him to sell them to \nit at a considerable loss. This evidence is uncontradicted, and being \ncorroborated, as it is, by other evidence in the case, we are constrained to \nfind that the accused has not violated any criminal law and should be \nacquitted.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of conviction is reversed and the accused acquitted.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

CECILIO IMAZ, ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED SALUSTIANO ZUBELDIA, AND WARNER, BARNES &amp; CO., LIMITED, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the \nProvince of Albay in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff in an \naction of ejectment.\n<p>The facts in the case are substantially undisputed. It appears that in \nJanuary, 1906, Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, the owner 'in fee simple of a \ntract of land in the town of Albay, part of which is in dispute in this action, \nbegan proceedings in the Court of Land Registration for the registration of its \ntitle thereto under the provisions of Act No. 496. In June, 1906, said company \nsold a portion of the land thus undergoing registration to Salustiano Zubeldia, \nwhose estate is represented by the defendant Cecilio Imaz as administrator. By \nan oversight, however, said company failed to amend the proceedings before the \nCourt of Land Registration so as to exclude from the land described therein that \nportion thereof which it had sold to Zubeldia.<\/p>\n<p>Immediately after the sale Zubeldia entered into posession of the land in \nquestion, made improvements thereon, and erected a stone wall along the dividing \nline between the lot sold to him and the rest of the property retained by \nWarner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, undergoing registration as aforesaid. The \nfact that Zubeldia had been in actual possession of the property in question \nfrom the time of its sale to him down to the time of his death, which occurred \nduring the pendency of this action, was known to the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>About three years after the sale to Zubeldia the Court of Land Registration, \nin the proceeding hereinbefore referred to, entered a decree in favor of Warner, \nBarnes &amp; Co., Limited, registering its title to the tract of land described \nin the application, including therein the land sold to Zubeldia, the fact of the \nsale to him, as we have already said, having been overlooked by the parties to \nsaid proceeding.<\/p>\n<p>In July, 1911, G, M. Laing, the agent of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, \nin Albay, acting in behalf of the company, agreed, by a proper instrument in \nwriting, to sell to the plaintiff in this case, for the sum of P3,000, <em>the \nremainder of the tract of land from which Zubeldia's lot had been sold.<\/em> \nThat this was the land actually sold and no other is certain. Laing testified \nthat before executing the contract of sale to the plaintiff he took him \npersonally to inspect the land which he was buying and pointed out the \nboundaries thereof; that at that time the land sold to Zubeldia some four years \nbefore was entirely cut off from the rest of the land by a stone wall. Laing \npointed out the wall as being the limit of the land under consideration, saying, \n\"I took him there and showed him the walls, advising him that the part we \ndesired to sell him was all that contained within the walls on the \nland.\"<br\/><br\/>A short time after the execution by Lamg of the contract with the \nplaintiff, Juan T, Figueras, manager of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, arid \nin representation of said company, executed a conveyance of the land in question \nto the plaintiff, taking the description of the land set out in the conveyance \nfrom the description of the property <em>as registered in the Court of Land \nRegistration.<\/em> On account of the fact, however, that the sale to Zubeldia \nhad been overlooked in the proceedings for the registration of title, the \ndescription in the conveyance executed by Figueras on behalf of the company \nincluded not only the land sold to plaintiff <em>but also the land sold four \nyears before to Zubeldia.<\/em> Plaintiff's conveyance was duly delivered to him \nand, upon its presentation to the registrar of deeds of Albay, a certificate of \ntitle was issued to him under the provisions of Act No. 496.<\/p>\n<p>In November 1911 plaintiff made a demand upon Zubeldia for the possession of \nthe property then occupied by him, the same being, as we have said, included in \nthe description in the conveyance received by him from Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., \nLimited. The demand for possession having been refused, plaintiff commenced this \naction in December, 1911, against Zubeldia. The latter obtained an order of the \nCourt of First Instance for the inclusion of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, \nas a party defendant, and said company is the real defendant in the \ncase.<br\/><br\/>The complaint alleges that the plaintiff is the owner of the land \noccupied by Zubeldia. The answer denies this and alleges that the inclusion of \nthe Zubeldia lot in plaintiff's conveyance was due to a mutual mistake, and asks \nthat the court make a correction of the record by the exclusion of the Zubeldia \nproperty from plaintiff's conveyance and the records thereof. The judgment of \nthe court granted the relief prayed in the answer.<\/p>\n<p>We have no doubt from the evidence in this case that the plaintiff knew, at \nthe time the contract of the sale was executed, as well as when the conveyance \nwas made, that Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, did not intend to sell him the \nland which it had already sold to Zubeldia about four years before; and that his \npurchase was restricted to the land adjoining that sold to Zubeldia and \nseparated therefrom by a stone wall which, in large part, inclosed the lands \nsold to and then occupied by Zubeldia.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff relies for a reversal of the judgment upon the proposition that \na Torrens title is absolutely indefeasible and that as he has a certificate of \ntitle showing from the description therein that he is the owner of the lands \noccupied by Zubeldia, such title cannot be successfully resisted by the \ndefendants herein.<\/p>\n<p>There might be some force in this declaration if the litigation were between \nthe plaintiff and Zubeldia alone, and the plaintiff were an innocent purchaser \nfor value. Undoubtedly, so far as an innocent purchaser for value is concerned, \nthe decree of registration of the Court of Land Registration cut off the title \nof Zubeldia to the land in question and left him with naked possession alone. \nBut, as between plaintiff and Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, he is not an \ninnocent purchaser for value; indeed, he is not a purchaser at all. As we have \nsaid, it is substantially undisputed that Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, and \nthe plaintiff agreed, the one to sell and the other to buy, a certain parcel of \nland, with definite boundaries, perfectly visible on inspection, which lands and \nthe boundaries thereof were shown to the purchaser by the seller and were \nrecognized and accepted by him as the boundaries of the land which he proposed \nto buy. In other words, the minds of the parties met upon the purchase and sale \nof a given, definite parcel of land. By a mistake, an oversight, there crept \ninto the instrument by which it was sought to make the proposed sale effective a \ndescription which included not only the land which the parties had agreed upon \nas the subject matter of their contract but also an additional piece of land \nwhich was not within the contemplation of either party at the time the contract \nof sale was made. As between Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, and the \nplaintiff, therefore, the latter got nothing by reason of the mistake which the \ncompany made in the description of the land sold. Immediately on discovering the \nerror Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, could have brought an action to correct \nthe conveyance and make it represent the real intention of the parties. As \nbetween them no question as to the indefensibility of a Torrens title could \narise. Such an action could have been maintained at any time while the property \nremained in the hands of the purchaser. The peculiar force of a Torrens title \nwould have been brought into play only when the purchaser had sold to an \ninnocent third person for value the lands described in his conveyance. <\/p>\n<p>Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, being a party to this action, and the land \nstill remaining in the hands of the purchaser, the plaintiff herein, Warner, \nBarnes &amp; Co., Limited, may, on behalf of Zubeldia, or his successors in \ninterest, exercise the same rights and pursue the same remedies which it could \nhave exercised and pursued if it had been the plaintiff in an action to correct \nthe description in the conveyance by which the property was transferred to the \nplaintiff. There having been a mutual mistake between Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., \nLimited, and the plaintiff in this case in the execution of the conveyance in \nquestion, that mistake can be corrected in the action before us, the defendant, \nWarner, Barnes &amp; Co., Limited, having presented in its answer facts \nsufficient for such affirmative relief and such relief having been prayed \naffirmatively therein. That is precisely what the learned trial court did, and \nwe are of the opinion that it acted correctly.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C J., Carson<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p><\/div>",

The motion is based upon the \nground that execution was issued for an amount in excess of that for which the \nsurety is liable upon his bond.\n<p>It appears that on November 28,1906, plaintiffs instituted this action and \nthat on November 30, 1908, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a \ndecree ordering substantially :<\/p>\n<p>1.

The motion to quash the \nexecution as to the excess over the contractual obligation of the surety, Blas, \nwas granted, and plaintiffs have appealed.<\/p>\n<p>Upon this statement of the facts of the case we agree with the trial judge, \nwho held as follows;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I am of the opinion that the sureties upon the appeal bond of Cho Jan Ling, \nconditioned that the defendant should comply with the judgment entered if it was \nconfirmed, can not be called upon as sureties to satisfy any judgment \nsubsequently entered. The conditions of the bond were that he should pay a sum \nof money, transfer some property and render an accounting. This does not include \nthe condition that the sureties would pay any amount which might be found due \nupon the accounting. The liability of the sureties is limited to that which is \nspecifically stated in the bond, and their contract has been complied with, with \nthe exception of the payment of the sum of P24,155.95, as stated.<\/p>\n<p>\" It was error to issue the execution against the sureties for the amount of \nthe subsequent judgment.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The real question involved in this appeal is one of interpretation of the \nterms of the bond, which must be construed in the light of the Civil Code \nprovision that: \"Security is not presumed; it must be express and cannot be \nextended further than that specified therein.\" (Art. 1827.)<\/p>\n<p>Appeal bonds are ordinarily given to secure the fulfillment of final \njudgments, and the measure of the surety's liability is ordinarily the amount of \nthe final judgment rendered in the case in the course of which the appeal arose. \nBut the appeal in this case appears to have been taken, without objection from \nany of the parties, from a judgment which by its very terms was not final, in \nthat it did not dispose of all the issues raised by the pleadings. It may well \nbe that had the plaintiff stood upon his rights, the former appeal would not \nhave been allowed until a final judgment had been entered; or, if allowed, that \nan appeal bond would have been required which would have secured the payment of \nany amount which might be found due under the accounting. But since plaintiff \nwent forward at that time without insisting upon his rights, and accepted \nwithout objection an appeal bond which did not in express terms or by necessary \nimplication secure to him all that he might have demanded, he will not now be \npermitted to read into the bond a provision which he did not then insist \nupon.<\/p>\n<p>Of course the liability of Cho Jan Ling was not terminated by merely \nrendering the accounts on which, under the terms of the original decree, \njudgment for P18,813.34 was there-after entered against him. But the question \nhere is not as to the liability of Cho Jan Ling, The question before us is as to \nthe liability assumed by the sureties on the bond. Cho Jan Ling's liability is \nwholly independent of the bond, while theirs is strictly limited by its terms. \nHence, while we agree with counsel for appellants, and the cases cited by him, \nthat the duty of guardians, trustees, administrators and the like to account for \nthe funds which come into their hands is not finally fulfilled by the mere \npreparation of a statement of the amount of their receipts and disbursements, so \nlong as any funds remain in their hands, we by no means agree with him that \nbecause this duty rested upon Cho Jan Ling it necessarily rested on the sureties \non his appeal bond.<\/p>\n<p>The sureties on the appeal bond guaranteed merely that Cho Jan Ling would \ncomply with the judgment requiring him \"to render his final accounts;\" not that \nhe would do what he was and is morally bound to do, that is, to account for and \nturn over all the funds of plaintiff in his possession. The judgment, compliance \nwith which was guaranteed by the sureties, did not in itself provide for the \nturning over of the balance due as a result of the accounting. For that purpose \nthe entry of a new decree was necessary. The sureties on the appeal bond neither \nexpressly nor impliedly undertook to guarantee compliance with any other \njudgment than that already entered when the instrument was executed.<\/p>\n<p>The order entered in the court below should be affirmed, with the costs of \nthis instance against the appellants.

I declare to be my sisters in lawful wedlock the persons named Dona \nAntonia Uson, now deceased, who has left two daughters called Maria Rosario, \nwidow, and Maria Paz, unmarried; Maria Romualda Uson, widow of Estanislao \nLengson; Ignacia Uson, married to Don Vicente Puzon; Eufemia Uson, now deceased, \nwho is survived by three daughters called Maria Salud, Maria Amparo, and Maria \nAsuncion; and Maria Pilar Uson; Maria Manaoag Uson, unmarried, issue had by our \ndeceased father Don Daniel Uson with one Leonarda Fernandez, alias Andao de \nLingayen, so that they may have and enjoy it in equal parts as good sisters and \nrelatives.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The court below found that the children of the deceased sisters should take \nonly that portion which their respective mothers would have taken if they had \nbeen alive at the time the will was made; that the property should be divided \ninto six equal parts corresponding to the number of sisters; that each living \nsister should take one-sixth, and the children of each deceased sister should \nalso take one-sixth, each one-<br\/>sixth to be divided among said children \nequally.<br\/><br\/>This appeal is taken from the judgment entered upon that \nfinding, appellants asserting that under a proper construction of the paragraphs \nof the codicil above-quoted the property should be divided equally between the \nliving sisters and the children of the deceased sisters, share and share alike, \na niece taking the same share that a sister receives.<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the appellants' contention is well founded. We see \nno words or phrases in the clauses quoted which lead necessarily to the \nconstruction placed upon those paragraphs by the learned court below. On the \nother hand, we find expressions which seem to indicate with fair clearness that \nit was the intention of the testatrix to divide her property equally between her \nsisters and nieces. The court below based its construction upon the theory that \nthe other construction would be \"an admission that the testatrix desired to \nfavor her deceased sister Eufemia Uson, who left three children, more than her \nother deceased sister Antonia Uson, who left two children, and moreover both \nwould be more favored than any of the other four surviving sisters, one of whom \nwas married at the time of the execution of the said codicil-and without doubt \nhad children.\"<\/p>\n<p>As we look at the codicil we observe, first, that the testatrix, in the first \nparagraph thereof, declares that after her husband's death she desires that \"my \nsisters <em>and nieces, as hereinafter named,<\/em> shall succeed him as \nheirs.\"<\/p>\n<p>We note, in the second place, that the testatrix, in the second paragraph of \nthe codicil, names and identifies each one of her heirs then living, or each one \nof the persons whom she desires shall succeed her husband in the property. Among \nthose mentioned specifically are the nieces as well as-the sisters. The nieces \nare referred to in no way different from the sisters. Each one stands out in the \nsecond paragraph of the codicil as clearly as the other and under exactly the \nsame conditions. <\/p>\n<p>In the third place, we note, with interest, the last clause of the second \nparagraph of the codicil which, it seems, to us, taken together with the last \nclause of the first paragraph of the codicil, is decisive of the intention of \nthe testatrix. In the last clause she says that she names all of the persons \nwhom she desires to take under her will by name \"so that they may take and enjoy \nthe property <em>in equal parts<\/em> as good sisters <em>and \nrelatives.<\/em>\"<\/p>\n<p>We have then in the first paragraph a declaration as to who the testatrix \ndesires shall become the owners of her property on the death of her husband. \nAmong them we find the names of the nieces as well as of the sisters. We have \nalso the final declaration of the testatrix that she desires that the sisters \nand nieces shall take and enjoy the property in equal parts. That being so, it \nappears to us that the testatrix's intention is fairly clear, so clear in fact \nthat it is unnecessary to bring in extraneous arguments to reach a conclusion as \nto what she intended.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is hereby modified by declaring that, of the \nproperty passing under the codicil herein-above referred to, the living sisters \nand the children of the deceased sisters shall take per capita and in equal \nparts, and as so modified the judgment is affirmed. No costs in this \ninstance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Carson <\/em>and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><em>Trent, J<\/em>., dissents.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

ANDREA CATINDING, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"><strong><\/strong>This action was instituted by Luis Esperanza and Baltazar Bullo, acting as \n<em>apoderados<\/em><p> (attorneys in fact) for and on behalf of Florentino \nEsperanza, for the recovery of certain described real property situated at \nAnaoaon, municipality of Surigao, Province of Surigao, and which the petition \nalleges is unlawfully held and claimed by the defendant.<\/p>\n<p>Upon the proof adduced at the trial of the cause judgment was entered in the \ncourt below dismissing the complaint, and from this judgment the present appeal \nis prosecuted.<\/p>\n<p>The trial judge made a very full statement of the facts upon which he based \nhis judgment, and after a careful examination of the record we are of opinion \nthat the record fully supports the conclusions reached by the lower court. \nPractically the only question presented by this appeal is the degree of credit \nwhich should have been accorded to the witnesses who testified. Not only have \nthe plaintiffs failed to establish their contention by a preponderance of the \nevidence but even out of the mouths of their own witnesses they have refuted the \nvery facts upon which their claim rests.<\/p>\n<p>The record establishes that one Julian Catmon, the grandfather of the \ndefendant, was the owner and in possession of various parcels of land during his \nlifetime, including the parcel now in question. After his death these several \nparcels of land were partitioned among his children and the parcel in question \ncame into the possession of his daughter Venancia Catmon, who was married to \nRamon Catinding and to whom there were born four children, Policarpio, Andrea \n(the defendant), Ruperto and Eulogio. The record shows that Venancia Catmon and \nRamon Catinding were married during the lifetime of Julian Catmon and that they \nbuilt a small house on the land and lived there for a number of years. Andrea \nCatinding, the defendant, appears to have made her home with her grandfather, \nJulian Catmon, who lived in another house nearby on the same land. Venancia \nCatmon the first wife of Ramon Catinding and the mother of the defendant, died, \nand shortly therefore Ramon Catinding married one Sabina Butron and with his \nsecond wife came and lived on the land in question for a short space of \ntime.<\/p>\n<p>The record does not establish the dates of these various events. It merely \nshows that for many years the land in question was in the possession of the \ngrandfather; that it passed from him to his daughter Venancia, who with her \nhusband Ramon Catinding and their children continued living on the land; that \nafter the death of Venancia the surviving husband Ramon married again and came \nand lived with his second wife on the land for a short time only. In the \nmeantime it appears that Andrea, the defendant, had married a Spaniard named \nGonzalez, who died in 1896. During at least a part of the time that Andrea was \nmarried to Gonzalez she did not live on the land, but it appears that her \nbrother Eulogio, who was married at this time, had been living on the land. The \nrecord shows that there were at least two houses on this land. After the death \nof her husband in 1896 Andrea returned to the land and has continued living \nthere up to the present time, or at any rate was living on the land at the time \nhis action was instituted.<\/p>\n<p>In December, 1898, Ramon Catinding and Sabina Butron executed a deed to the \nland in question to Baltazar Bullo who claims that he purchased it for his \ngrandson Florentino Esperanza, and again in May, 1904, Ramon Catinding and \nSabina Butron went before a justice of the peace at Surigao and executed another \ndeed to Baltazar Bullo for the same land. This last deed appears to have been \nexecuted in order to overcome any defects that might be found in the first \ninstrument. A great deal of the proof offered by plaintiffs relates to the \nexecution of these deeds. It is not denied that these deeds were executed but it \nis claimed by the defendant that Ramon Catinding and Sabina Butron had no title \nwhatever to the land, and for that reason no rights or interests which could be \nconveyed by these deeds. <\/p>\n<p>Plaintiffs deny that the land in question was ever a part of the land of \ndefendant's grandfather, Julian Catmon, or that it had ever been the property of \nVenancia Catmon, defendant's mother; they assert that the land was entered upon \nby Ramon Catinding and Sabina Butron while it was yet unclaimed and uncultivated \nland; that it was first cultivated by them and that their title in the land was \nby reason of this original occupancy. While the plaintiffs introduced some \nevidence tending to establish this fact they utterly failed to establish it by a \npreponderance of the evidence. Even the plaintiffs' own witnesses, Maria Ciceros \n(pp. 35, 36, 37 of the record) and Baltazar Bullo, the person who claims to have \npurchased the land (pp. 41 and 42), admitted that the defendant had been in \npossession of this land for a number of years at the time the deed was executed, \nand had been cultivating the land and receiving the benefits therefrom. On the \nother hand the defendant introduced a number of witnesses who were familiar with \nthe land in question and who testified positively and emphatically that the land \nhad formerly belonged to Julian Catmon, had descended from him to his daughter \nVenancia, and that it had been held and claimed by her children since her death. \nThe record seems to be conclusive upon the fact that Ramon Catinding's \nconnection with this land was by reason of his wife's ownership and that she had \ninherited it from her father; To reach any other conclusion means absolutely to \ndisregard the weight of the evidence in the record. The record does not support \nthe conclusion that Ramon Catinding and his second wife, Sabina Butron, were the \nfirst to enter upon this land and cultivate it, and without proof of that \nalleged fact the whole case for the plaintiffs must fall.<\/p>\n<p>But while we have reviewed the evidence of record in this case for a similar \nreason to that announced for a like action in the case of Arroyo vs. Granada (18 \nPhil. Rep., 484), that is to say, in the hope that what we have said \"may have \nthe effect of forestalling further litigation\" the judgment entered in the court \nbelow must be modified, under the authority of the former decision, so as to \nprovide for the dismissal of the complaint, not upon the merits, but upon the \nground that the action was not properly instituted, having been brought in the \nname of apoderados (attorneys in fact), and not in the name of the real party in \ninterest.<\/p>\n<p>Let judgment be entered modifying the judgment entered in the court below, so \nas to provide for a dismissal of the complaint, not upon the merits, but on the \nground that it was improperly instituted, not having been brought in the name of \nthe real party in interest, with the costs of both instances against the \nappellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

It has also been proved that there had \nbeen no previous trouble between the defendant and the deceased, but that on the \ncontrary they had always been on intimate terms of friendship.<\/p>\n<p>\"The defendant, testifying in his own defense, stated that upon seing that \nthe deer, which the deceased had also noticed, might escape, he made haste to \napproach the latter, who had his back toward him and was on his left, and that, \nin taking hurried steps for that purpose, the defendant stumbled against an \nembankment or pilwpil that lay between him and the deceased; that thereupon he \nfell on one knee, an accident which caused the shotgun, which he had already \nloaded, cocked, and aimed at the deer, the half of whose body was now lost from \nsight, to be discharged, this one charge striking the deceased in the head.<\/p>\n<p>\"The crime charged in the present case should be qualified as one of homicide \noccasioned by reckless negligence\u2014a crime provided for and punished by article \n568, in connection with article 404, of the Penal Code\u2014for the reason that there \nwas no malice or criminal intention on the part of the defendant in the \ndischarge of his shotgun which resulted in wounding and causing the \ninstantaneous death of the deceased, Mauricio Ramos; but there was, however, \nreckless negligence on the part of defendant, for, as the deceased, whom he was \napproaching, was almost directly in front of him, he should have taken the \nprecaution\u2014an elemental one in handling firearms so likely to be discharged by \nthe slightest accident\u2014not to have carried his shotgun cocked and aimed, as he \ndid on the occasion in question.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The defendant having appealed from the said judgment, his counsel accepts the \nfinding therein made of the proved facts, but contends that the court erred in \nholding that such facts constitute reckless negligence and, therefore, in \napplying article 568 of the Penal Code.<\/p>\n<p>According to the trial judge, the reckless negligence on the part of the \ndefendant consists in that the latter did not take the necessary precaution, \nwhich the court considered elemental on that occasion in view of the \ncircumstances, not to carry his shotgun cocked and aimed; but the court also \ntook into account the fact that, as testified by the defendant, the discharge of \nhis firearm (the shot from which wounded and killed the deceased) was caused by \nhis stumbling against an embankment or <em>pilapi<\/em>l that lay between him and \nthe victim, causing him to fall to one of his knees.<\/p>\n<p>The accidental cause, then, of the discharge of the arm was not due to the \nfact of the defendant's having it cocked and aimed, but to the accident of his \nstumbling against an embankment in the way. The occurrence was entirely \naccidental and involuntary. Consequently, the crime charged in this prosecution \nlacks the necessary element to allow of its being considered as reckless \nnegligence under article 568 of the Penal Code, as would have been the case if \nthough through no malice on the part of the defendant, the damage had been \nproduced, nevertheless, by some voluntary act of his (U.

Rep., 434) this \ncourt, citing the case of Ahern vs. Oregon Telephone Co., (24 Oreg., 276, 294; \n35 Pac, 549), said: \"Negligence is want of the care required by the \ncircumstances. It is a relative or comparative, not an absolute, term and its \napplication depends upon the situation of the parties and the degree of care and \nvigilance which the circumstances reasonably require. Where the danger is great, \na high degree of care is necessary, and the failure to observe it is a want of \nordinary care under the circumstances.\"<\/p>\n<p>In order to determine, therefore, whether there was imprudence or negligence \non the part of the defendant, or whether or not he took the necessary \nprecautions to avoid the unfortunate accident that occurred, the surrounding \ncircumstances, the nature of the act that he was about to perform or was \nperforming and the situation in which he found himself, must be taken into \naccount.<\/p>\n<p>In the judgment appealed from the statement is made that the defendant, \naccording to his testimony, when he stumbled against the embankment or \n<em>pilapil<\/em> and fell to the ground on one knee already had his shotgun \ncocked and aimed at the deer, the half of whose body was then lost to sight.<\/p>\n<p>It is shown by the testimony of the defendant himself that when he perceived \nthat there was a deer in sight he was three or four meters away from the \ndeceased and, with respect to the relative position of the latter and the \ndefendant, at the point marked No. 3 on the rough sketch (Exhibit 1), that is, \nbehind the deceased, who was at a point a little aside and to the right of a \nstraight line in the direction of the deer, so that, as appears from the said \nsketch, the defendant, from where he was, could have discharged his gun at the \nanimal without serious danger to the deceased, because the latter was not in the \ndirect line of fire, but some distance away.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant, explaining what occurred and what he did as soon as he became \naware of the presence of the deer, testified as follows, in answer to various \nquestions:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. Tell how the accident that is the subject matter of the information filed \nagainst you before this court occurred.\u2014A. One afternoon of the month of \nDecember, one night of the month of December, Mauricio Ramos and Santiago \nAbandia came to my house and told me to get ready.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I followed them and on my replying 'yes,' they added, 'quickly.' I hastened \nto saddle my horse and when it was saddled mounted it and we rode toward the \nnorth. When he arrived at the barrio of Quinatihan and the irrigated land there, \nwe loaded our shotguns and headed for the north, through this irrigated land, in \nquest of deer, and we had not traveled long before he stopped his horse.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. Who was 'he'?\u2014A. The deceased, Mauricio Ramos. And my horse came up to \nhis horse, behind his horse. On seeing that he was dismounting, I checked my \nhorse, backed it up, tied it and went to the place where he was; but, on making \na turn to pass around behind his horse, I saw him in the act of leaning forward, \ntaking aim, and, owing to my haste, for I saw that the deer was about to run, I \nstumbled against something and slipped, which caused the shotgun I was carrying \nto go off.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Is this the shotgun you were carrying?\u2014A. Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. When you were hurrying to the place where he was, after you had tied your \nhorse, how was your shotgun ?\u2014A. I was going toward him with the shotgun, \npointed upwards and held in both hands, and was pushing the safety catch to \nrelease it, when I saw the deceased in a stooping position, almost on his knees, \naiming at the deer.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. So that that shotgun of yours was at safety or had the safety catch \nclosed when you were going toward him ?\u2014 A. Yes, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. And why did you go to him, for what purpose?\u2014A. Because he was stooping \nand was aiming, and I saw the deer.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. And for what purpose and why did you run toward the deceased?\u2014A. I saw \nhim almost kneeling down on the ground and aiming, but he had been in this \nposition for some little time and had not fired. I saw the deer, or half of its \nbody. It was about to escape. I, too, wanted to shoot, and went in his direction \nso I could shoot the deer.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. What did you stumble against?\u2014A. An embankment of earth, for it was in a \nhigh place.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p align=\"center\">*******<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. Did you say that upon your stumbling against something the shotgun went \noff?\u2014A. Yes sir.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The court:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. When your gun was discharged was the safety catch still closed ?\u2014A. No, \nsir. Just at the moment I raised the safety catch I slipped and did not know how \nthe gun went off, for it was discharged at the moment I \nstumbled.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The fiscal:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. How were you carrying the shotgun when, as you said, you pressed the \nsafety catch to lock it?\u2014A. I had my shotgun with me. The other man had his \nshotgun in a horizontal position, almost in aim. He had stopped to fire. I was \nwalking pretty fast and was pushing up the safety catch when I stumbled and the \nbarrel of the shotgun rose up at the same time that I fell.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. So that you fell?\u2014A. I did not fall to the ground, but bent toward it so \nmuch that I nearly fell down.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Did the shotgun touch the ground?\u2014A. No, sir.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p align=\"center\">*******<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. When you saw the deer you got excited, aimed at it, and fired at it, did \nyou not?\u2014A. No, sir. My intention was to get nearer to it or alongside the \ndeceased to take aim afterwards and shoot from there.\" <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The court:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. When you were approaching the deceased, did you see where the deer was \nstanding?\u2014A. I saw only a half of the deer's body and I made haste.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. Did you believe that the deer would get away from you without your firing \nat it?\u2014A. I feared that, for he had been aiming some time and had not \nfired.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The fiscal:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. Immediately after you alighted from your horse and saw the deer, did you \naim at it?\u2014A. No, sir.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. At what moment did you aim at it; when you were approaching the deceased \n?\u2014A. I aimed at the deer when I saw the deceased kneeling, in a kneeling \nposture, and when only half of the deer's body was in sight.<\/p>\n<p>\"Q. And you were going along\u2014that is to say, you were aiming at the deer \nwhile you were walking?\u2014A. Yes, sir. The muzzle of the gun was pointing toward \nthe deer.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From the foregoing questions and answers, it is seen that when the defendant \nbecame aware of the presence of the deer he saw the deceased squatting down, \nalmost kneeling on the ground and aiming at the animal; that he had been in this \nposture for some little time without shooting, and as the defendant could see \nonly half of the deer's body and the animal was about to run away, the defendant \ntried to approach or get beside the deceased, in order to aim and shoot thence; \nthat he did in fact go toward the deceased, holding the shotgun in both hands \nwith the barrel pointing upwards, though in the direction of the deer, and with \nthe safety catch closed; and that, at the moment he pushed up the safety catch \nto open it, he stumbled against an embankment, slipped and fell, and the gun he \nwas holding in his hands was discharged.<\/p>\n<p>Under the circumstances in which the defendant found himself, it was not \nnecessary for him to employ extraordinary caution, because the danger in which \nthe deceased, who was at one side though some distance ahead of him, might then \nhave been was not great; it was enough that he should have taken the precaution \nthat he did, and which was that which the circumstances required in attempting \nto approach the deceased, to point upwards the gun he was carrying and to take \nadvantage of the occasion when the deceased was squatting and almost kneeling in \nthis position the latter could not be in danger of being hit if the gun was \nfired, while, on the other hand, he would have been free from all danger, had \nthe defendant succeeded in getting beside him, as he intended to do, in order to \nshoot thence, as being a point from which he could see the whole of the \ndeer.<\/p>\n<p>Neither can it be held that there was negligence or lack of care in the fact \nthat the defendant tried to open the safety catch of the gun while he was going \ntoward the deceased and when he was but a short distance from him, for, in view \nof the nature of the act which he was about to perform, it was natural that he \nshould have the gun prepared to fire at the game, at once, or as soon as he \nshould have succeeded in placing himself beside his companion. So, if the gun \nwas discharged through the defendant's having stumbled against an embankment \nthere, the shot causing the death of his companion, and this embankment cannot \nbe attributed to a want of caution or precaution on the part of the defendant \n(he did not see it, for, as he himself testified, he was going along with his \neyes fixed on the deer, and it is also understood that he would not have been \nlooking down, as he had his companion near at hand), the death of the deceased \ncan only be attributed to an unforeseen and unfortunate accident, for which the \ndefendant can not be held criminally liable.<\/p>\n<p>The Attorney-General, however, states in his brief that the defendant's \nliability may reasonably be inferred from his testimony given in the criminal \ninvestigation held before the justice of the peace of Candelaria, Tayabas. That \ntestimony, which is shown in Exhibit B presented in evidence at the trial, in \nthe part thereof pertinent to the matter in question, reads as follows: \"We were \nhunting on horseback and had agreed that if the man who was well ahead, that is, \nMauricio, should alight from his horse, it would be a sign that he had found an \nanimal; and it happened in fact that Mauricio did alight from his horse. Then I \nalso dismounted and on seeing that there was a deer immediately fired at it, \nbut, owing to the confusion existing at the time, I am unable to say positively \nwhether or not he fired before I did, or whether I shot the deer or \nthe<br\/>deceased.\"<\/p>\n<p>According to the justice of the peace himself, who testified at the trial, \nthe said testimony was taken down by him in Spanish, he having translated it \nfrom Tagalog, in which language the defendant testified before him. Counsel for \nthe defense, on the other hand, tried to prove by means of cross-questions \naddressed to the justice of the peace at the hearing, that the latter, in taking \ndown the said testimony in Spanish, after translating it from Tagalog\u2014the \nlanguage used by the defendant\u2014must have omitted there-from that part of the \nstatement he made at the trial, relative to the cause of the discharge of the \nshotgun on that occasion.<\/p>\n<p>From the aforementioned testimony it merely appears indeed that an agreement \nhad been made between the deceased, Mauricio Ramos, his other companion and the \ndefendant, that when the man who was well ahead, that is, the deceased, should \nalight from his horse, it would be a sign that there was game in sight; and that \nthe defendant, on seeing that Mauricio, the deceased, had alighted from his \nhorse, also dismounted from his and, on seeing that in fact there was a deer, \nimmediately fired his shotgun at it.<\/p>\n<p>The lower court ascribed very little importance to this testimony, for it is \nnot mentioned in the decision, but took due account of that given by the \ndefendant at the trial; he found him guilty upon the ground that, as aforesaid, \nhe did not take the proper precaution, in view of the circumstances, not to \ncarry his shotgun at that time cocked and aimed. But even though the first \ntestimony had been taken into account, it could not serve to prove that the \ndefendant acted with negligence or want of diligence in firing the shot, for the \nsimple reason that there is not a single detail in the testimony in question as \nto the positions of the defendant and the deceased with relation to each other, \nnor to that of the deceased in relation to the deer, which was in sight of the \ndefendant. Neither can it be affirmed, upon examination of the rough sketch \nExhibit 1, that the deceased was in the line of fire, for, on drawing a straight \nline from the deer to the defendant, as shown in the sketch, it is seen that the \ndeceased was not on the line, but at one side of it and at such a distance away \nfrom it as to preclude the idea that he would be in such danger as to have made \nit necessary for the defendant to have adopted precautions other than those the \nactual circumstances of the case required before he fired his gun from that \nposition.<\/p>\n<p>After due consideration, then, of the said testimony, either separately or in \nrelation with the merits of the case, and of that given by the defendant himself \nat the trial, also in connection with the same merits, it cannot be held that \nthe defendant is guilty of the crime of homicide through reckless negligence, as \ncharged in the complaint. <\/p>\n<p>Therefore, reversing the judgment appealed from, we freely absolve the \ndefendant, with the costs of both instances de oflicio.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Once below, Daonoto held Carreon fast by the neck and Palgan \nraised up his arms so that he might not offer any resistance, and while in this \nposition Zacarias Estopia thrust a dagger into his abdomen. As a result of the \nwound the victim died on the following day. Such are the facts disclosed by the \ntestimony given <em>in articulo mortis<\/em> by Carreon, corroborated in all \ntheir details by the eyewitnesses Juan Saquin, Melquiades Saquin, and Benito \nMoso. The defendants' counsel himself says in this instance that it is entirely \nbeyond doubt and discussion, as admitted by all, that it was the defendant \nZacarias Estopia who inflicted the dagger thrust, that this assault took place \nat the foot of the stairs of the house of Benito Moso, that the cause of the \nquarrel was the treading on Daonoto's foot, and that, on account of the quarrel, \nall the guests in the said house ran away. (Brief, p. 3.) The defense concludes \nthat the crime was one of simple homicide and that the person solely liable \ntherefor was Zacarias Estopia.\n<p>With respect to the participation of Zacarias Estopia, the trial court \nclassified the crime as murder, attended by the qualifying circumstances of \npremeditation and treachery, in addition to the generic one of abuse of superior \nstrength; and as regards Dalmacio Dapnoto and Patricio Palgan, also as murder, \nwith the generic aggravating circumstances defined in Nos. 9 and 14 of article \n10 of the Penal Code. He sentenced all three to suffer the penalty of death.<\/p>\n<p>On the occasion that Antonio Carreon was killed, Zacarias Estopia also \nwounded Melquiades Saquin by stabbing him through the left forearm, likewise \nwith a dagger; but this crime was neither included in the complaint nor in the \nsentence. The three defendants were only charged with and sentenced for the \nmurder of Antonio Carreon. It is important that this point appear of record, in \norder that the facts relative to the said Melquiades Saquin may not be \nconsidered as <em>res judicata<\/em> in this case.<\/p>\n<p>The crime is properly classified as murder, not on account of the qualifying \ncircumstance of premeditation, which did not concur in the commission thereof, \nfor the quarrel arose unexpectedly and no one had thought of it before it \noccurred, but because of treachery, which without the slightest doubt did exist. \nIt is improper to take account of the aggravating circumstance of superior \nstrength, inasmuch as it was precisely the aid and participation of Daonoto and \nPalgan that constituted the method which tended directly and especially to \ninsure the commission of the crime without such risk to the person of Estopia as \nmight have arisen from any defense which Carreon might have been able to make, \nand further because such acts performed by the said Daonoto and Palgan \nconstituted the treacherous manner of committing the crime. They are \ncoprincipals, both being responsible for the death thus caused, and should be \npunished in the same degree as the defendant Estopia.<\/p>\n<p>The two circumstances enumerated in the judgment, with respect to Daonoto and \nPalgan, are the ninth, abuse of superior strength, and the fourteenth, \"that the \ncrime be committed with the aid of armed men, or of persons who insure or afford \nimpunity.\" Neither of these should be taken into consideration, because one is \nincluded in the treachery and the other is inapplicable to the case.<\/p>\n<p>The crime committed is, therefore, simply that of murder, for which the law \nimposes the penalty of <em>cadena temporal<\/em> in its maximum degree up to \ndeath. The penalty should be imposed in the medium degree, that is, <em>cadena \nperpetua,<\/em> as the Solicitor-General recommends in this instance, but since \nthe three defendants must be allowed the benefits of article 11 of the Penal \nCode, owing to their lack of education, the degree applicable is the \nminimum.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed and Zacarias Estopia, Dalmacio \nDaonoto, and Patricio Palgan are hereby sentenced to twenty years of <em>cadena \ntemporal <\/em>and the accessory penalties, to indemnify the family of the \ndeceased in the sum of P1,000, and to pay, each of them, one-third of the costs \nof both instances.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson, Moreland<\/em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> \nconcur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

The plaintiff alleges that the \ndefendants are indebted to her in the sum of P20,791.81. The plaintiff alleges \nthat said sum (P20,791.81) is made up of her portion of the estate of the said \nFernando Escano, and of the sum of P3,500 as the price of a certain parcel of \nland sold by her to the defendants in the year 1910.\n<p>The plaintiff alleges that by reason of a judgment rendered against her in \nfavor of the defendants, amounting to P16,739.89, she is justly indebted to the \nsaid defendants in that sum and indicates her willingness to allow said claim to \nstand as an offset of her claim against the defendants. She alleges that the \ndefendants refuse to accept her offer. The plaintiff alleges, in a way which \ndoes not clearly appear, that the defendants have been threatening her with an \nexecution for the sum of P6,944. For the constant threats and menaces on the \npart of the sheriff to execute said execution upon her property, she claims that \nshe has been damaged in the sum of P5,000. The plaintiff prays for judgment for \nthe difference between the sum of P20,791.81 and P16,739.89, or the sum of \nP4,051.92, together with damages in the sum of P5,000, and costs.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants presented a general denial, denying each and all of the \nallegations of the petitioner's complaint.<\/p>\n<p>At the close of the trial, the Honorable Ramon Avancena, judge, rendered a \ndecision in which he dismissed the complaint upon the ground that the plaintiff \nhad shown no cause of action against the defendants, with costs against the \nplaintiff. From that judgment the plaintiff appealed to this court and made the \nfollowing assignments of error:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I. The court erred in finding that the defendants are not indebted to the \nplaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>\"II. The court erred in holding that compensation cannot be awarded, because \nthe firm 'Viuda e Hijos de Escano' is the trustee of said credits.<\/p>\n<p>\"III. The court erred in holding that some of the sums .claimed by the \nplaintiff are not net, nor owing.<\/p>\n<p>\"IV. The court erred in not decreeing the compensation requested by the \nplaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>\"V. The court erred in not making permanent the injunction issued by the \ncourt at the beginning of the action.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>With reference to the first assignment of error, it may be said that the \nlower court found, as a fact, that at the time of the settlement of the estate \nof Fernando Esca\u00f1o, there was due to the plaintiff, as her share of the estate, \nthe sum of P11,151.56, and that that sum was turned over to the association \nknown as \"Viuda e Hijos de Esca\u00f1o\" by the administrator; that later the \nplaintiff sold a certain piece or parcel of land to the said association, \namounting to F3.500. The record does not show by what authority the said sum of \nP11,151.56 was turned over to the said society (Viuda e Hijos de Esca\u00f1o). There \nis nothing in the record which shows that the defendants, as coheirs of the said \nFernando Esca\u00f1o, have, or ever have had, the share of the estate of Fernando \nEscano in their possession. The plaintiff herself, in her petition, alleges that \nafter the partition of the estate of Fernando Escano, and when said society was \norganized, her share of the estate was turned over to the society. The plaintiff \nmakes no allegation that the defendants were ever in possession of said sum. If \nthey were never in possession of her interest in the estate of Fernando Esca\u00f1o, \nthe plaintiff certainly cannot be entitled to recover from them her interest in \nthe said estate.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff further admits that the sum of P3,500, which she is now \nattempting to recover of the defendants, was the result of the sale of a certain \ntract of land sold by her to the said society\u2014\"Viuda e Hijos de Escano.\" \nAccording to her own admissions, therefore, the said sum of P3,500 cannot be \nrecovered of the defendants. The lower court held, and we believe rightly, that \nthe action of the plaintiff should have been brought, in view of the allegations \nof the plaintiff, not against the coheirs, even though they individually \nconstituted the said society, but against the society known as \"Viuda e Hijos de \nEsca\u00f1o.\" This conclusion seems to be sufficiently based upon the allegations of \nthe plaintiff in her petition. Moreover, the record contains further proof \nshowing that the society \"Viuda e Hijos de Esca\u00f1o\" was, in fact, the entity \nwhich owed the plaintiff the sum mentioned in the complaint, and not the \ndefendants. It will be remembered that the defendants had a judgment against the \nplaintiff for the sum of P16,739.89. The defendants had an execution issued upon \nthat judgment. When the sheriff made an effort to execute the judgment, the \nplaintiff wrote him a letter in which she stated that the said society had in \nits possession the very sums of money which she is now seeking to recover from \nthe defendants personally. (See Exhibit 5.) Said letter fully sustains the \nconclusions of the lower court, with reference to the first assignment of error. \nIn accordance with said letter (Exhibit 5), the sheriff testified that he did \nattach a portion of the property in the hands of said society, mentioned in said \nletter, and did sell the same at public auction. In our judgment, the lower \ncourt did not commit the error alleged in the first assignment of error.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the second assignment of error above noted, it will be \nremembered that the petitioner alleged that the defendants had a judgment \nagainst her in the sum of P16,739.89 and that she desired to have that amount \ncompensated against her claim of P20,791.81. The lower court denied her right to \nhave that compensation made. It will be remembered that the judgment of the \ndefendants was in their favor personally, as against the plaintiff. According to \nthe admissions (see Exhibit 5) of the plaintiff in the present case, the \nindebtedness of P20,791.81 is not an indebtedness against the defendants, as \nsuch, or individually, but an indebtedness against the society known as \"Viuda e \nHijos de Esca\u00f1o.\" This being true, one debt cannot be compensated against the \nother. An indebtedness of A against B cannot be compensated against an \nindebtedness in favor of B against C. Compensation can only take place when the \nrespective claims are against the real parties to the action. Compensation shall \ntake place only when two persons, in their own right, are mutually creditors and \ndebtors of each other. (Art. 1195, Civil Code.) In the present case the \nplaintiff is attempting to have compensation of an indebtedness against her in \nfavor of the defendants, in an action against the defendants for an indebtedness \nthat exists between the plaintiff and a third party (Viuda e Hijos de Esca\u00f1o). \nThe present is not a proper case for compensation. (8 Manresa, 307.)<\/p>\n<p>We believe that it is not necessary to discuss the other assignments of \nerror, for the reason that it has been demonstrated that according to the \nallegations and admissions of the plaintiff herself, the present action cannot \nbe maintained against the present defendants.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff claims that she has been damaged.by the sheriff, by reason of \nhis threats to levy an execution upon her property, in the sum of P5,000. There \nis nothing in the record which justifies a judgment in favor of plaintiff for \nthat sum.<\/p>\n<p>After a careful examination of the record, we are persuaded that the judgment \nof the lower court should be affirmed. It is therefore ordered and decreed that \na judgment be entered affirming the judgment of the'lower court, with costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Edgar \n&amp; Co., Inc.<\/p>\n<p>This sale was made by the defendant against the protest of the plaintiff and \nwith the warning that he would be held liable under the contract hereinabove set \nforth and in accordance with its terms. In fact, the defendant Fox offered to \nsell his shares of stock to the plaintiff for the same sum that McCullough was \npaying\" for them less P1,000, the penalty specified in the contract.<\/p>\n<p>The learned trial court decided the case in favor of the defendant upon the \nground that the intention of the parties as it appeared from the contract in \nquestion was to the effect that the agreement should be good and continue only \nuntil the corporation reached a sound financial basis, and that that event \nhaving occurred some time before the expiration of the year mentioned in the \ncontract, the purpose for which the contract was made had been fulfilled and the \ndefendant accordingly discharged of his obligation there under. The complaint \nwas dismissed upon the merits.<\/p>\n<p>It is urged here that the court erred in its construction, of the contract. \nWe are of the opinion that the contention is sound. The intention of parties to \na contract must be determined, in the first instance, from the words of the \ncontract itself. It is to be presumed that persons mean what they say when they \nspeak plain English. Interpretation and construction should be the instruments \nlast resorted to by a court in determining what the parties agreed to. Where the \nlanguage used by the parties is plain, then construction and interpretation are \nunnecessary and, if used, result in making a contract for the parties. \n(Lizarraga Hermanos <em>vs.<\/em> Yap Tico, 24 Phil. Rep., 504.)<\/p>\n<p>In the case cited the court said with reference to the construction and \ninterpretation of statutes: \"As for us, we do not construe or interpret this \nlaw. It does not need it. We <em>apply<\/em> it. By applying the law, we conserve \nboth provisions for the benefit of litigants. The first and fundamental duty of \ncourts, in our judgment, is to <em>apply<\/em> the law. Construction and \ninterpretation come only after it has been demonstrated that application is \nimpossible or inadequate, without them. They are the very last functions which a \ncourt should exercise. The majority of the laws need no interpretation or \nconstruction. They require only application, and if there were more application \nand less construction, there would be more stability in the law, and more people \nwould know what the law is.\"<\/p>\n<p>What we said in that case is equally applicable to contracts between persons. \nIn the case at bar the parties expressly stipulated that the contract should \nlast one year. No reason is shown for saying that it shall last only nine \nmonths. Whatever the object was in specifying the year, it was their agreement \nthat the contract should last a year and it was their judgment and conviction \nthat their purposes would not be subserved in any less time. What reason can be \ngiven for refusing to follow the plain words of the men who made the contract ? \nWe see none.<\/p>\n<p>The appellee urges that the plaintiff cannot recover for the reason that he \ndid not prove damages, and cites numerous American authorities to the effect \nthat because stipulations for liquidated damages are generally in excess of \nactual damages and so work a hardship upon the party in default, courts are \nstrongly inclined to treat all such agreements as imposing a penalty and to \nallow a recovery for actual damages only. He also cites authorities holding that \na penalty, as such, will not be enforced and that the party suing, in spite of \nthe penalty assigned, will be put to his proof to demonstrate the damages \nactually suffered by reason of defendant's wrongful act or omission.<\/p>\n<p>In this jurisdiction penalties provided in contracts of this character are \nenforced. It is the rule that parties who are competent to contract may make \nsuch agreements within the limitations of the law and public policy as they \ndesire, and that the courts will enforce them according to their terms. (Civil \nCode, articles 1152, 1153, 1154, and 1155; Fornow <em>vs.<\/em> Hoffmeister, 6 \nPhil. Rep., 33; Palacios <em>vs.<\/em> Municipality of Cavite, 12 Phil. Rep., \n140; Gsell <em>vs.<\/em> Koch, 16 Phil. Rep., 1.) The only case recognized by the \nCivil Code in which the court is authorized to intervene for the purpose of \nreducing a penalty stipulated in the contract is when the principal obligation \nhas been partly or irregularly fulfilled and the court can see that the person \ndemanding the penalty has received the benefit of such part or irregular \nperformance. In such case the court is authorized to reduce the penalty to the \nextent of the benefits received by the party enforcing the penalty.<br\/><br\/>In \nthis jurisdiction, there is no difference between a penalty and liquidated \ndamages, so far as legal results are concerned. Whatever difference exists \nbetween them as a matter of language, they are treated the same legally. In \neither case the party to whom payment is to be made is entitled to recover the \nsum stipulated without the necessity of proving damages. Indeed one of the \nprimary purposes in fixing a penalty or in liquidating damages, is to avoid such \nnecessity.<br\/><br\/>It is also urged by the appellee in this case that the \nstipulation in the contract suspending the power to sell the stock referred to \ntherein is an illegal stipulation, is in restraint of trade and, therefore, \noffends public policy. We do not so regard it. The suspension of the power to \nsell has a beneficial purpose, results in the protection of the corporation as \nwell as of the individual parties to the contract, and is reasonable as to the \nlength of time of the suspension. We do not here undertake to discuss the \nlimitations to the power to suspend the right of alienation of stock, limiting \nourselves to the statement that the suspension, in this particular case is legal \nand valid.<br\/><br\/>The judgment is reversed, the case remanded with instructions \nto enter a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for \nPl,000, with interest; without costs in this instance.<br\/><br\/><em>Arellano, C. \nJ., Trent<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" no=\"\" shade=\"\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<div align=\"center\"><br\/><br\/><strong>CONCURRING<\/strong>\n<p><\/p><\/div>\n<p><strong>CARSON, J.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I concur.<\/p>\n<p>I think it proper to observe, however, that the doctrine touching the \nconstruction and interpretation of penalties prescribed in ordinary civil \ncontracts as set forth in the opinion is carried to its extreme limits and that \nits statement in this form is not necessary to sustain the decision upon the \nfacts in this case.<\/p>\n<p>Without entering upon an extended discussion of the authorities, it is \nsufficient for my purposes to cite the opinion of the supreme court of Spain, \ndated June 13, 1906, construing the provisions of article 6 of Book 4, Title 1 \nof the Civil Code which treats of \"contracts with a penal clause.\" In that case \nthe court held:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The rules and prescriptions governing penal matters are fundamentally \napplicable to the penal sanctions of civil character.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This as well as other cases which might be cited from American as well as \nSpanish authorities indicate that special rules of interpretation are and should \nbe made use of by the courts in construing1 penal clauses in civil contracts, \nand that cases may well arise wherein the broad doctrine laid down in the \nopinion of the court may not be applicable.<\/p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed and case remanded with instructions.<\/em><\/p><\/div>",

Dicen ambos esposos que, \naunque ya fuera del taller, acostumbraba Tomas de la Cruz pasar por las tardes \nal mismo marchandose con Pedro Enriquez despues del trabajo: que en el expresado \ndia 7 de Diciembre de 1912 habian hecho el recuento del dinero que tenian en el \ncajon de una mesa situada en el dormitorio dentro del mismo local del taller, y \nresulto que sumaba 120 pesos. Esta es toda la prueba de la preexistencia del \ndinero que se dice hurtado.<\/p>\n<p>En cuanto a su falta posterior, la aseguran los mismos esposos.<\/p>\n<p>Y en cuanto a la responsabilidad que se atribuye a los acusados, no hay mas \ntestigo de cargo que Eligio del Barrio, un operario del taller. Alejo declaro \nque se hallaba fuera del taller en la hora que se supone cometido el hurto (a \nlas 7 de la noche), y solo tuvo noticia de que Pedro Enriquez fue el que saco el \ndinero de dentro del cajon y lo entrego a Tomas de la Cruz, noticia que le \ndieron su esposa Maria Lopez y el obrero Eligio del Barrio: que pregunto a este \nsi habia visto cuando se abrio el cajon y le contesto que si, diciendo que Pedro \nfue quien lo habia abierto cogiendo el dinero que estaba envuelto en un \nperiodico, entregandoselo a Tomas y marchandose luego ambos.<\/p>\n<p>Maria Lopez declara que en un compartimiento del taller se halla el \ndormitorio de ambos esposos y en el mismo la mesa, y en otro compartimiento, \ndonde trabajan los operarios, se hallaban ella y Eligio del barrio: en una parte \ndice que antes de salir los acusados se hallaban estos en el lugar del \ndormitorio cerca de la mesa (f.15); mas en otra parte, al folio 16, dice: \n\"cuando entramos los dos de Eligio en el lugar donde fuimos a coser, el Pedro \nestaba vistiendose al lado de la mesa y el Tomas estaba cerca de la puerta de la \ncalle\". En esta situacion, hallandose Maria Lopez y Eligio del Barrio cosiendo \nen el compartimiento en que trabajan los operarios, \"Eligio del Barrio, dice la \ntestigo, me llamo y me dijo: \"ha sonado el cajon o he notado ruido del cajon de \nla mesa\"; entonces yo que estaba en el interior de la tienda sali inmediatamente \na ver, fui a la puerta de la calle a ver a los dos, y como no los viera,volvi, \nabri el cajon, halle que no estaba el envoltorio con el dinero y entonces me fui \na dar conocimiento a mi marido en la otra tienda\". f.13. Mas adelante, \npreguntada por el Juzgado, dijo que Pedro Enriquez habia vuelto aquella misma \nnoche a cenar en el taller (pues que vivia y comia alii mediante dos pesos \nsemanales que pagaba) y que el dia siguiente 8, domingo, no habia estado en el \ntaller, pero que el lunes 9 habia vuelto. El marido dice igualmente, contestando \npregunta del Juzgado, que el dia 9 \"habia vuelto para trabajar, pero que le \npregunto reservadamente sobre la cantidad que habia desaparecido y si realmente \nera uno de los que la habian sacado y lo nego; diciendole entonces: pagame lo \nque me debes y puedes marcharte\": que pago el Pedro lo que le debia, 9 pesos con \n90 centimos b, y se marcho.<\/p>\n<p>Eligio del Barrio, de 18 a\u00f1os de edad, afirmo que Pedro fue quien abrio el \ncajon y saco de alli un envoltorio, y se lo entrego a Tomas e inmediatamente se \nmarcharon los dos. Este testigo habia hecho fuera de juicio dos declaraciones \ncontradictorias en affidavits otorgados, uno ante un Notario Carrasco en tagalo, \npero puesto por el notario en castellano, cuya existencia y contenido confirma \nen este proceso, y otro ante un Notario Azucena en tagalo presentado original en \nel el juicio, su fecha 13 de Abril de 1913 (el juicio tuvo lugar en 19 de \nNoviembre siguiente) Exhib. 1. Dice asi: \"Yo, Eligio del Barrio, soltero, etc. \netc. bajo juramento declaro lo siguiente: 1. 0 Que Alejo Avelino me hizo firmar \nun documento donde yo declaro que Pedro Enriquez y Tomas de la Cruz hurtaron \ndinero al referido Avelino; 2. 0 Que el referido documento, que habia firmado en \nsu presencia solamente, dejo sin valor ni efecto, porque no es cierto lo que en \nel mismo habia declarado. Lo he firmado con motivo de que el me obligo y me \natemorizo de que entablaria demanda contra mi por mi deuda etc. etc. En \ntestimonio de lo cual firmo este documento en San Pablo, Laguna, hoy 13 de Abril \nde 1913. (Firmado) Eligio del Barrio\". Acerca de este documento, declaro en el \njuicio que efectivamente habia hecho semejante declaracion, pero no bajo \njuramento, y que la habia hecho a requerimiento de su padre, no obstante lo cual \ninsistia, por ser la verdad, en lo que habia declarado en el juicio.<\/p>\n<p>Pedro Enriquez declaro que no solamente habia cenado en la noche del 7 en el \ntaller, segun afirma Maria Lopez, si no ademas, dormido; y que el 8 habia \ncontinuado en el haciendo todas sus comidas y dormido alli; que el dia 9 se \ndespidio de Alejo Avelino, porque Eulogio San Pedro, con quien antes que con \nAvelino habia trabajado en el mismo ramo, le requeria para que volviese a su \ntaller, y estando conforme con ello le pidio prestado el dinero que debia a \nAvelino, pago a este su deuda y fuese al taller de San Pedro donde no habia sido \nmolestado hasta el dia 13.<\/p>\n<p>Tomas de la Cruz dice que el dia 8 habia ido a su pueblo. Pateros a causa de \nla enfermedad de un hijo suyo: que el dia 11 fue a Pateros Avelino para \nrequerirle a que volviese a su taller, pero no acepto el requerimiento: que \nvolvio despues de las Pascuas o sea en Enero de 1913 a San Pablo, al saber que \nle imputaba Avelino haber hurtado dinero: que con Eulogio San Pedro ganaba lo \nmismo que con Avelino, pero este no tenia bastante trabajo y el ganaba al tanto \nde lo que trabajaba.<\/p>\n<p>Avelino no nego que habia estado efectivamente en Pateros, pero dice que fue \ntan solamente para saber el apellido del Tomas, sin lo cual no podia hacer la \ndenuncia su abogado, el notario Carrasco, aquel del primer exhibit sobre la \ndelacion de Eligio del Barrio imputando a estos acusados el hurto.<\/p>\n<p>Esto es lo importante en la causa.<\/p>\n<p>Un solo testigo, Eligio del Barrio, afirma la comision del hurto por los dos \nprocesados. En frente de tal afirmacion, esta la negacion de cada uno de los \nprocesados. Y ni un dato mas hay en el proceso para asentir a la afirmacion \nantes que a la negacion. Y esto, dando ya por suficientemente probada la \npreexistencia del dinero que se dice hurtiado. Maria Lopez, advertida por Eligio \ndel Barrio de haber sonado el cajon, (lo cual, hallandose juntos trabajando en \nun mismo sitio, tanto como Barrio pudo haber oido aunque se hallaba, segun dice; \nagachada), salio enseguida tras Pedro Enriquez que tuvo que apartarse del cajon \nque sono, y atravesar el compartimiento en que se hallaban los dos trabajando, y \ndirigirse a la puerta donde se hallaba el Tomas a quien, segun del Barrio, \nentrego el envoltorio, y saldria asi apresuradamente para retenerlos, para \ntenerlos a mano y averiguar lo del sonido del cajon o para increparlos desde \nluego o para decir, en fin, o hacer algo. No los vio ya; pero a la noche volvio \nal taller Pedro para cenar, (aunque no fuera mas que para cenar), y ni le \nincrepo, ni dijo, ni hizo nada. Tampoco al dia siguiente. Hombres ambos esposos \nsimplemente unos menestrales que sufren una perdida para ellos considerable, de \n120 pesos con abuso do confianza de parte de personas a quienes albergaban en su \ncasa, no aparece que hicieran nada hasta que perdieron el dia 9 el trabajo de \nPedro Enriquez y volviera el dia 11 o 12 de Pateros el Avelino sin haber \nconseguido atraer de nuevo a su taller a Tomas de la Cruz o sabiendo ya entonces \nsu apellido, pero colocados ambos en el taller de Eulogio San Pedro, el Pedro \nEnriquez desde el dia 9 de Diciembre y el Tomas de la Cruz desde el 24 de \nNoviembre, mientras que solo quedo trabajando en el de ellos el Eligio del \nBarrio, quien resulta muy trabajado como testigo de cargo, pues que aparece en \nel juicio con dos affidavits contradictorios.<\/p>\n<p>No puede resultar del proceso convencimiento acerca de la existencia del \ndelito y de la razon de imputabilidad del mismo.<\/p>\n<p>Se revoca la sentencia apelada y se absuelve libremente a los procesados con \nlas costas de oficio en ambas instancias.

After a careful \nreview of the whole record we are well satisfied that the findings of fact by \nthe trial judge are fully sustained by the evidence adduced in the court below. \nAccepting these findings of fact we think that the reasoning upon which the \ntrial judge bases his conclusions of law and of fact sufficiently and \nsatisfactorily disposes of all the contentions of counsel for the appellant.<\/p>\n<p>There is much of general and public interest in the opinion filed in the \ncourt below, and we think we can best dispose of this appeal by reproducing that \nopinion in full, holding as we do that it correctly and satisfactorily disposes \nof the issues raised in these proceedings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The applicant, Do\u00f1a Demetria Cacho, applies for the registration of a parcel \nof land in each of the cases above enumerated, both parcels being situated in \nthe municipality of Iligan, Moro Province, Philippine Islands.<\/p>\n<p>\"The parcel applied for in each case is particularly described in the \ncorresponding application and a plan of both parcels is attached to the record \nin case 6908, marked 'Exhibit A.' Both of the parcels are situated within the \nlimits of military reservation No. 43, pending in this court, which military \nreservation is generally known as 'Camp Overton.'<\/p>\n<p>\"The registration is opposed by the Government of the United States \nrepresented by the commanding general of the Division of the Philippines, on the \nground that the two parcels applied for are the property of the United States, \nacquired by cession from Spain by virtue of the Treaty of Paris, and that said \nparcels form a part of the military reservation mentioned.<\/p>\n<p>\"The applicant appeared personally, represented by her attorney D. Leocadio \nJ. Italia, and the commanding general appeared, represented by Capt. H. V. \nEvans, of the Eighth Infantry; Capt. Guy S. Nurvell, of the Eighth Cavalry; and \nLieut. Milton G. Holliday, of the Eighth Cavalry. Neither the Attorney-General, \nnor any one else, appeared for the Director of Lands or the Government of the \nPhilippine Islands.<\/p>\n<p>\"By agreement of both parties the two cases were heard together.<\/p>\n<p>\"From the proofs taken at the trial and an ocular inspection of the premises \nmade in the presence of the parties, the court finds:<\/p>\n<p>\"1. The parcel of land described in case No. 6908 was purchased by the \napplicant, Dona Demetria Cacho y Soriano from Gabriel Salzos. The deed of \nGabriel Salzos, Exhibit C of said case in favor of the applicant, is dated \nSeptember 14, 1904, but according to the deed itself the land was sold by Salzos \nto her on December 17, 1903. The title of Gabriel Salzos is founded on a deed of \nsale in his favor, executed and Bigned by a Moro woman named Alanga, who acted \nfor her husband, a Moro named Darondon. This deed is Exhibit B of case No. 6908. \nNo power of attorney or authorization, required by law, from the Moro Darondon \nin favor of his wife Alanga has been presented. <\/p>\n<p>\"2. The parcel, object of case No. 6909, was purchased by the applicant Dona \nDemetria Cacho from the Moro, Datto Bunglay. The deed of sale in favor of the \napplicant is dated January 15, 1904, but was not acknowledged before the notary \npublic until March 15, 1910. This deed is Exhibit G of case No. 6909.<\/p>\n<p>\"3. It is not proven that either of the deeds of the Moros mentioned were \nexecuted with the consent of the United States or the Government of the \nPhilippine Islands.<\/p>\n<p>\"4. The parcel described in case No. 6908 was cleared, tilled, and planted to \ncoco, mango, lanzones, and other fruit trees by the Moro Darondon and his wife \nAianga during their marriage many years before American occupation. The exact \ndate of the first cultivation of this parcel is impossible to determine from the \nevidence. But the Mora Aianga testified that the coco trees were planted more \nthan twenty years ago, and the court is satisfied that the greater part of the \ncocos are 20 or 25 years of age. Datto Duroc, witness for the Government, \ntestified that Darondon, who, according to the witness, is also a datto, married \nhis (the witness') sister Alanga and that this parcel of land belonged to them \nbecause they planted the coco trees with his permission, or rather without his \nopposition.<\/p>\n<p>\"As will be seen hereafter, Datto Duroc claimed as his own all the land now \nin question between the River Nunucan and the River Agus, with the exception of \nthis parcel and a small part of the parcel subject of case No. 6909, which, \naccording to his testimony, belonged to his uncle, Datto Anandog. Datto Duroc \ntestified also that Datto Darondon is still alive and that according to the Moro \ncustom the wife cannot sell the land of her husband while he is still alive.<\/p>\n<p>\"This parcel, object of case No. 6908, is small, the fruit trees are \ndistributed over the whole parcel, and the court is satisfied that Datto \nDarondon and his wife Aianga have possessed, occupied, administered, and \ncultivated the land continuously, openly, pacifically, and as owners for at \nleast twenty-five years.<\/p>\n<p>\"5. The parcel of land claimed by the applicant in case No. 6909 is the \nlarger of the two parcels and contains 37.87 hectares, or more than 90 acres. It \nis a long narrow strip of land stretching along the beach in a southwesterly \ndirection between the mouths of the Nunucan and Agus River. It is almost 2 \nkilometers long, and includes all the target range of Camp Over ton.<br\/><br\/>\"The \ntestimony of the witnesses as to the cultivation of this parcel is somewhat \ncontradictory and not very satisfactory. To better understand the testimoney it \nis necessary to take into account the fact that the Moro Dalano has a small \nparcel of land between this parcel and the Nunucan Rfver which separates this \nland from the other parcel subject of the application in case No. 6908.<\/p>\n<p>\"Datto Bunglay who sold this land to the applicant, as the court understands \nfrom his declaration, claims to have acquired part of it by inheritance from his \nuncle, Datto Anandog, who died without issue, and the balance by his own \npossession and cultivation. The testimony of this witness is somewhat confused \nand contradictory. But he testified that his uncle Anandog cleared the land, and \nthat he helped clear portions of it himself. That they planted about 70 cocos, \n12 mango, 45 nanca, and about 150 cacao trees; that 12 of the coco trees and all \nof the other fruit trees except the 8 manga trees were planted by his uncle \nDatto Anandog on the southwestern portion of the land near the River Agus; that \n58 coco trees were planted by himself on the northern portion near the River \nNunucan; and that 'these coco trees were not bearing fruit yet at the time when \nthe land was sold to the applicant Dona Demetria Cacho. He further testified \nthat he planted a hedge of tubatuba on the boundary line of the parcel; that his \nhouse was on the northeast part of the land partly near the three mango trees, \nand partly near point 25 of the boundary line marked on the plan; that the house \nof his uncle was on the southern portion near the River Agus where the fruit \ntrees planted by him, mentioned above, were located. There are 3 mango trees yet \nstanding on the west side of the road which leads from Camp Overton to Camp \nKeithly near point 25 of the plan, and the court can very'well believe that \nthere was formerly a house in the vicinity of these mango trees. There were also \nsome fruit trees and a house on the southwestern portion of the land near the \nRiver Agus, and some of the fruit trees and portions of the house still \nremain.<\/p>\n<p>\"The court is satisfied also that there were formerly cocos and perhaps some \nnanca and other fruit trees near the River Nunucan; but it appears that these \ntrees were on the land of the Moro Dalano. The portion of the land not cleared \nby the military for use as a target range is a wooded jungle very similar to the \nland across the road from it, which is marked on the plan as Government land and \nwhich nobody claims has ever been cultivated. There are trees 2 or 3 feet in \ndiameter on the part of the land not cleared, and the court noted fallen trunks \nof about the same diameter on the part cleared near the beach. But there are not \nmany large trees on this land nor on the adjoining Government land. <\/p>\n<p>\"The court tried to find the remains of the tubatuba hedge, which, according \nto the witness Bunglay, was planted on the boundary line of the land, not only \non the day of the ocular inspection but also on another day when the court was \non the land for more than an hour. No traces of this hedge could be found. It is \npossible that the hedge has been destroyed by the military; but the greater part \nof the line between this land and the Government land adjoin ing has not been \ncleared and the court believes that if such a hedge had ever existed there would \nbe traces of it remaining. The court has made many ocular inspections of \nagricultural lands, and has often found remains of tuba-tuba hedges on lands \nabandoned for years and overgrown with brush. Nor is there cogon grass on the \npart not cleared by the military. The court noted some abandoned lands covered \nwith cogon between Camp Overton and Iligan not far from this land and the court \nis convinced that the vicinity is no exception to the general rule that \nabandoned lands first grow up with cogon and afterwards become covered with \ntimber.<\/p>\n<p>\"As to the portion of the land cleared by the military, which is marked \napproximately on the plan with the words 'cleared ground, Camp Overton target \nrange,' the court finds that before it was occupied by the military in the \nlatter part of the year 1902, it was a jungle and forest of the same general \ncharacter as the portions not cleared. The military forces .of the United States \nfirst occupied this land in October or November, 1902. This fact is established \nby the testimony of the witnesses present when it was first occupied, \ncorroborated by various documents and official letters attached to the record, \nwritten at that time in 'Camp No. 1' or 'Camp Nunucan.' One of these letters, \nExhibit 5, is dated November 26, 1902, at 'Camp No. 1.' Part of the \nTwenty-eighth Infantry Regiment and part of the Tenth Cavalry were the first \ntroops to occupy the land; and when it was first occupied it was known as 'Camp \nNo. 1' and also 'Camp Nunucan.' A large part of the land was cleared to \nestablish the camp thereon, but after two or three months the troops were \nremoved to the north side of the Nunucan River on the present site of Camp \nOverton. The land was occupied anew as a target range in 1904.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is proven by the witnesses who helped clear the land, that when it was \nfirst occupied by the troops it was not inhabited nor did Moros or others live \nin the vicinity, except on the banks of the Nunucan River; and it appears to the \ncourt from the proofs that these Moros were the ones living on the first parcel \nand on the land of Datto Dalano. Nor were there houses or fences on the land. \nThe land was a jungle and forest with some trees of considerable size, and there \nwere no signs of cultivation except the cocos and other trees near the .River \nAgus, the mango trees near the road already mentioned, and two small patches of \nland that appeared to have been planted at some time to tobacco. The brush was \nso tall and thick, that, according to one witness, it was necessary to open \nroads or paths for the horses to pass. When the troops were transferred to Camp \nOverton, north of the River Nunucan, the land was abandoned until 1904, as \nalready stated, and during this period it was examined and purchased by Senor \nVidal, representing his wife Dona Demetria Cacho, the applicant. .<\/p>\n<p>\"It will be seen by the declaration of Senor Vidal that he arrived in Iligan \nDecember 31, 1902, and visited this land in 1903, undoubtedly after the troops \nwere transferred to another place, and it is not strange therefore, that, due to \nthe cleared condition of the land, the existence of the three manga trees by the \nside of the road and the cocos on the southern part, Senor Vidal should have \nconcluded that the larger portion of the land had been cultivated. Senor Vidal \ntestified also that there were some houses near the River Nunucan. It is \npossible that these houses were on the land of Dalano. But admitting that they \nwere on this land, it is not strange that they existed at the date of the first \nvisit of Senor Vidal. It is well known that houses are built up quickly around \nmilitary posts by employees and traders. Senor Vidal himself purchased the small \nparcel for his wife for the purpose of building a house and opening up a store \nto do business with the military. <\/p>\n<p>\"It will be seen also that Datto Duroc, called suftan of Dumarao, claimed all \nthe land in question between the River Nunucan and the River Agus. His claim was \nthe object of an investigation by Maj. R. L, Bullard of the Twenty-eighth \nInfantry, who certified under date of February 23, 1904, that his claim of \nownership and dominion was generally accepted by all of the Moros of the \nvicinity. (See Exhibit 1 of the Government.) This certificate has no value as a \ntitle, but it shows that on the date indicated Datto Duroc was claiming the land \nnow in question, publicly and before the only governmental authority existing in \nthe place at the time. It appears also from the proofs that Major Bullard was \ninvestigating the titles of the Moros for the purpose of acquiring and paying \nfor their lands.<\/p>\n<p>\"In order to better understand the character of the possession' of the \nvarious Moro claimants and properly appreciate their claims, the court believes \nit necessary to consider the laws, customs, form of government, habits, and \nindustries of the Moros, and especially as to agriculture and the cultivation of \nland.<\/p>\n<p>\"The government before the arrival of the Americans, as also afterward, \nexcept wherein it is modified by the American administration, was tribal and \npatriarchal. The population of the Moro country was not numerous and was \nscattered as compared with the other islands of the Archipelago. This population \nwas governed by numerous petty dattos. The most powerful of these dattos did not \nhave under his jurisdiction more than 1,000 men. Each datto had certain \nterritorial jurisdiction, or a certain amount of land under his control. Within \nthis land he and his sacopes, slaves, and subjects constructed a fortress called \na cotta and inside and around the cotta, he and his subjects lived. They took \nrefuge in the fortress to defend themselves when attacked. There were conflicts \nof territorial jurisdiction between the various dattos. From time immemorial \nthere were petty encounters and wars between them. These wars and the lack of \nexportation of products operated against the development of agriculture on an \nextensive scale, and, with the exception of a few Moros in the Cotabato Valley \nthey rarely planted more than was necessary for their own consumption.<\/p>\n<p>\"A tract of land 37 hectares in area, which is the extent of the land under \ndiscussion, is larger than is cultivated ordinarily by the Christian Filipinos. \nIn the Zamboanga cadastral case of thousands of parcels now on trial before this \ncourt, the average size of the parcels is not above 3 or 4 hectares, and the \ncourt doubts very much if a Moro with all his family could cultivate as, \nextensive a parcel of land as the one in question! The court has observed the \nold cottas and the lands cultivated in the vicinity of them on the shores of \nLake Lanao, and especially the cotta where the municipality of Dansalan is \nestablished on lands purchased of the Moro owners; and it does not appear to the \ncourt that the whole extent of cultivated land surrounding any of these old \ncottas would equal 37 hectares. Due to the establishment of Camp Keithley in \nrecent years, the Moros have planted extensively around said camp, and are, as \nthe court is informed, producing rice for commerce. But this is an exceptional \ncase and is due to peace and the fact that they now have a market for their \nproducts. Although the territorial jurisdiction of each datto was often \nextensive, the land planted by him and his sacopes was generally only a few \nhectares around his cotta. The plantings outside of this were generally \naccidental and temporary. In times of peace a Moro could plant in any part of \nthe jurisdiction of his datto. Nor did the planting of land necessarily indicate \nthat the person planting it was owner or claimant of the land planted, as will \nbe seen further on.<\/p>\n<p>\"The laws governing all the Moro tribes collectively are so vague and \nirregular in their application that the American Government found it useless to \ncodify them and make them of permanent application, in accordance with the \nprovisions of Act No. 787, the Organic Act of the Moro Province. See as a basis \nof what we have set forth as to the customs and laws of the Moros, the reports \nof the Philippine Commission and especially the report for the year 1904, part \n1, pages 5 to 14; report of Gen. Leonard Wood dated September 9, 1904; the data \ncontained in the Philippine census reports; and the collection of data of the \nJesuit fathers entitled 'El Archipielago Filipino,'<\/p>\n<p>\"The laws of most general application among the Moros of Mindanao are found \nin the 'Luwaran' Code brought to Mindanao by the Mohammedan conquerors and \namended by them to make them applicable to local conditions. A translation of \nthis code from the Arabic manuscript made by Dr. Najeeb M. Saleeby, is found in \nvolume 4, part 1, of the publications of the Ethnological Survey. A translation \nof the marginal annotations in the original manuscript, modifying the provisions \nto make them applicable to local conditions, is found in the same volume.<\/p>\n<p>\"There is no provision in this code nor in any other law of the Moros, \nexamined by the court, for the acquiring or transfer of lands by private \nparties. There is absolutely nothing relating to the prescription, or the \ncession, or sale of lands. Were it not for a provision (Art. XLVII) of said code \nregulating the renting of cultivated lands, the court would believe that there \nwas no private ownership of lands among the Moros. Due to the sanguinary \nstruggles between the dattos and the fact that they and their Moro subjects \nlived principally by means of fishing, hunting, robbery, and sometimes piracy, \nneither their habitations nor their cottas were fixed permanently, but were \nmoved from one place to another with facility and frequency. <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From the declaration of Datto Bunglay himself it will be seen that neither he \nnor his uncle Anandog lived continously on the land under discussion. They lived \nin other places outside of it also. It appears that a Moro could cultivate any \nunoccupied land of his datto or tribe and the fruits of his planting would be \nhis, even though the land passed into the possession of some other Moro. This \nright is recognized by Article XLVI of the 'Luwaran Code,' which provides that \nif a man finds his cattle or his trees in the possession of another, he has a \nright to the proceeds even though they continue in the possession of the second \nparty.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It appears that in the beginning the Americans believed, that the title to \nall of the land in the possession of a datto or Moro tribe was in the datto \nhimself, or the tribe, as common property; and it appears probable that Act No, \n718 prohibiting all cessions, deeds, and contracts of lease or rent by such \ndattos or tribes was promulgated under this belief. And it appears ta the court \nthat there was some foundation for this belief, and that in general, the lands \nwere the common property of the tribe. It is doubtful, at least, that the \nproperty of a Moro in the lands cultivated by him was any other than the right \nof usufruct or a property in the crops or trees planted. The writer of this \nopinion has been unable to find a single instance of sale or transfer of land \nfrom one Moro to another. A Moro can readily put a price on his animals or other \npersonal property, but he has no idea whatever of the value of his land. \nGenerally, he will answer such a question, saying that he has never sold land \nand does not know the value of it. The large parcel of land in question is \nlevel, and though sandy in some places, it appears to the court to be good \nagricultural land. Its value, taking as a basis the minimum price of P10 per \nhectare fixed for the sale of public lands by the Government under the \nprovisions of Act No. 926, would be P370, and it appears, to the court to be of \nfar greater value than that. The applicant insists that the just rental value \nwhich the Government should pay her as damages for the retention of this land \nduring the past eight years would not be less than P12,000 or P15,000 per year. \nDatto Bunglay sold all this land to the applicant for the insignificant sum of \nP250, as shpwn by the deed. Due, no doubt, to the abundance of land, the fact \nthat a Moro could occupy and cultivate any unoccupied land of his tribe and the \nother circumstances already mentioned, it appears that the Moros were not \naccustomed to sell land; nor did they generally have any idea of its just value. \nNor does it appear that a Moro datto distinguished clearly between the lands of \nhis own cultivation and those under his jurisdiction as datto. All this \ndemonstrates that the Philippine Commission worked wisely when it placed \nrestrictions on the sale of lands by Moro dattos and Moro tribes.<\/p>\n<p>\"Nevertheless the court is convinced that to a certain extent under the laws \nand customs of the Moros, a Moro was recognized as owner of the land cultivated \nby him for many years, and on which he had his home and the graves of his \nancestors. All the land outside of this was the common property of the tribe on \nwhich any Moro of the tribe might plant. Generally the tracts of land cultivated \nby the Moros were smaller in extent than those of the Christian Filipinos. <\/p>\n<p>\"6th. The court is convinced from the proofs that the small parcel of land \nsold by the Moro woman Alanga was the home of herself and her husband, Darondon, \nand was their conjugal property; and the court so finds.<\/p>\n<p>\"The court is also convinced from the proofs that the small portion in the \nsouthern part of the larger parcel, where, according to the proofs, Datto \nAnandog had his house and where there still, exist some cocos and fruit trees, \nwas the home of the said Moro Datto Anandog; and the court so finds. As to the \nrest of the large parcel the court does not find the title of Datto Bunglay \nestablished. According to his own declaration his residence on this land \ncommenced only a few days before the sale. He admitted that the coco trees he is \nsupposed to have planted had not yet begun to bear fruit at the time of the \nsale, and were very small. Datto Duroc positively denies that Bunglay lived on \nthe land, and it clearly appears that he was not on the land when it was first \noccupied by the military. Nor does Datto Bunglay claim to have planted the three \nmango trees by the roadside near point 25 of the plan. The court believes that \nall the rest of this parcel, not occupied nor cultivated by Datto Anandog, was \nland claimed by Datto Duroc and also bjKDatto Anandog and possibly by other \ndattos as a part of their general jurisdiction, and that it is the class of land \nthat Act No. 718 prohibits the sale of, by the dattos, without the express \napproval of the Government.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is also found that Datto Bunglay is the nephew of Dato Anandog, and that \nthe Moro woman Alanga, grantor of the small parcel, is the sister of Datto \nAnandog, and that he died without issue.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is insisted by the Government that the sale to the applicant is void \nunder the provisions of Act No. 718, which prohibits all grants, deeds, patents, \nand leases, from Moro sultans or dattos or the chiefs of non-Christian tribes \nconveying rights in land, made without the authority of the Spanish Government \nbefore American occupation, or the authority of the Government of the United \nStates or of the Insular Government since the sovereignty was transferred to the \nUnited States. But the court does not find this contention well founded. \nUndoubtedly the law prohibits the cession of rights in land the common property \nof the tribes, but does not prohibit the cession of his own land by an \nindividual Moro or other non-Christian. The law in question is very similar, \nalmost a copy, of section 2116 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, \nwhich prohibits the sale or transfer of lands by the chiefs of Indian tribes. \nThe Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Jones vs. Meehan (volume \n175, page 1, of the Supreme Court Reports), has decided that the prohibition is \nagainst the chiefs or tribes only, and that the sale by an Indian of his own \nprivate land is not prohibited by said law.<\/p>\n<p>\"As we have seen, the deed on which applicant's title to the small parcel \nrests, is executed only by the Moro woman Alanga, wife of Datto Darondon, which \nis not permitted either by the Moro laws or the Civil Code of the Philippine \nIslands. It appears that the husband of Alanga, Datto Darondon, is alive yet, \nand before admitting this parcel to registration it is ordered that a deed from \nDatto Darondon, husband of Alanga, be presented, renouncing all his rights in \nthe small parcel of land object of Case No. 6908, in favor of the applicant.<\/p>\n<p>\"It appears also that according to the provisions of the Civil Code as also \nthe provisions of the 'Luwaran Code' of the Moros, the Moro woman Alanga has an \ninterest in the portion of land left by her deceased brother, Datto Anandog. By \narticle LXXXV, section 3, of the 'Luwaran Code, it will be seen that the \nbrothers and sisters of a deceased Moro inherit his property to the exclusion of \nthe more distant relatives. Therefore Datto Bunglay had no legal interest \nwhatever in the land to sell to the applicant, Dona Demetria Cacho. But the Moro \nwoman, Alanga, having appeared as a witness for the applicant without having \nmade any claim to the land, the court finds from this fact that she has ratified \nthe sale made by her nephew.<\/p>\n<p>\"The court therefore finds that the applicant Dona Demetria Cacho is owner of \nthe portion of land occupied and planted by the deceased Datto Anandog in the \nsouthern part of the large parcel object of expediente No. 6909 only; and her \napplication as to all the rest of the land solicited in said case is denied. And \nit is ordered that a new survey of the land be made and a corrected plan be \npresented, excluding all the land not occupied and cultivated by Datto Anandog; \nthat said survey be made and the corrected plan presented on or before the 30th \nday of March, 1913, with previous notice to the commanding general of the \nDivision of the Philippines.<\/p>\n<p>\"On the 8th day of December, the court was at Camp Overton and had another \nocular inspection of the land for the purpose of fixing the limits of the part \ncultivated by Datto Anandog, so often mentioned herein, with previous notice to \nthe applicant and her husband and representative, Senor Dionisio Vidal. Having \narrived late, Senor\/Vidal did not assist in the ocular inspection, which was \nfixed for 3 o'clock, p. m. of the day mentioned. But the court, nevertheless, \nset stakes marking the N. E., S. E., and S. W. corners of the land found to have \nbeen cultivated by the deceased Anandog. The N. E. limit of said land is a \nbrook, and the N. W. corner is the point where the brook intersects the shore \nline of the sea, the other corners mentioned being marked with pine stakes. And \nit is ordered that the new survey be made in accordance with the points \nmentioned, by tracing four straight lines connecting these four points. Between \nthe portion cultivated by Datto Anandog and the mouth of the River Agus there is \na high steep hill and the court does not believe it possible to cultivate said \nhill, it being covered with rocks and forest.<\/p>\n<p>\"The attorney for the applicant insists in his brief that neither the \ncommanding general of the Division of the Philippines nor the officers who \nappeared to represent him were authorized, or had any right to represent the \nUnited States. This question was not raised at the trial, and the applicant did \nnot oppose the representation in any manner. It appears to the court that the \nobjection should not be considered now. Furthermore both Act No. 496 and Act No. \n627 seem to permit the representation.<\/p>\n<p>\"Nobody having appeared to oppose the applications up to this date, December \n10, except the Government of the United States represented by the commanding \ngeneral of the Division of the Philippines, a general default against all the \nworld except said Government, is ordered, and the allegations of the \napplications are taken as confessed by all the world, with the exception of the \nGovernment of the United States.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is further ordered that one-half of the costs of the new survey be paid \nby the applicant and the other half by the Government of the United States, and \nthat the applicant present the corresponding deed from Datto Darondon on or \nbefore the above-mentioned 30th day of March, 1913. Final decision in these \ncases is reserved until the presentation of the said deed and the new plan.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is so ordered.<\/p>\n<p>\"Given in Zamboanga, December 10, 1912.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Sgd.) \"JESSE GEORGE,<br\/><em>\"Associate \nJudge.\"<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>\n<p>The decree entered in the court below should be affirmed with the costs of \nthis instance against the applicant.

The evidence fully sustains the \ntrial judge in his findings: First, that Regino Bunduk, the original registered \nowner of this land, executed a deed of sale thereof in favor of one Pedro Manas, \nplaintiffs' predecessor in interest, on the 8th of August, 1893, and that a \ncautionary note (anotacion preventiva) of this instrument was entered in the \nland register on August 11, 1893; second, that this land was purchased by \ndefendant's predecessor in interest at a judicial sale of the property of Regino \nBunduk, the original registered owner, on May 2, 1892, and that his title \nthereto was duly registered on the 8th of September 1893; and, third, that the \nland in question had been in the undisturbed possession of defendant and her \npredecessors in interest from the date of this judicial sale in the year 1892 \ndown to the date of the institution of this action, a period of between eighteen \nand nineteen years.\n<p>Upon these findings of fact, and in accord with the doctrine frequently \nannounced by this court, the trial judge held that the title of plaintiffs must \nbe held to prevail over that of the defendant under the provisions of article \n1473 of the Civil Code, which are as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If the same thing should have been sold to different vendees, the ownership \nshall be transferred to the person who may have first taken possession thereof \nin good faith, if it should be personal property.<\/p>\n<p>\"Should it be real property, it shall belong to the person acquiring it who \nfirst recorded it in the registry.<\/p>\n<p>\"Should there be no entry, the property shall belong to the person who first \ntook possession of it in good faith, and, in the absence thereof, to the person \nwho presents the oldest title, provided there is good faith.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The only question as to the correctness of this ruling by the trial judge \nwhich need be considered is the contention of defendant's counsel that the \nprovisions of this article are not applicable, because the title of Pedro Manas, \nplaintiffs' predecessor in interest, was not duly registered, the evidence \ndisclosing merely that a precautionary notice was entered on the land register \non the 11th of August, 1893.<\/p>\n<p>It appears however that the precautionary annotation in the land registry \nbearing date of August 11, 1893, expressly sets forth that the deed was not \ndefinitely and formally registered \"for lack of the necessary indexes\" (por \nfalta de indices), and precautionary annotations of this kind were given the \neffect of definite, registries by the Royal Decree of June 15,1897.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment entered in the court below should be and is hereby affirmed, \nwith the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The authenticity of this possessory information is not and never has been questioned. <p>The person securing this possessory information was Don Ramon Ortiz, a resident of the said town of San Jose, who, according to the contents of the information, \"proved before the justice of the peace of that town the possession he had held of said land for fifteen years previously, when he had acquired it by cultivating it himself, without securing any written title;\" and it was approved by order of July 2, 1892.<\/p> <p>On March 10, 1909, Marcelina Ortiz, daughter of the said Don Ramon Ortiz, addressed to Asuncion Fuentebella the following letter:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"I have been informed that you are thinking of setting out coco palms on the lands that our parents possess in the place called Tagas, of this municipality, used as a pasture for our cattle, within the boundaries formed on the north by the rivulet Rangas Sadang, on the east by the beach, on the south by the San Miguel River that flows into the Sabang Bunga, and on the west by the lands of Gaspar Codillo and others. If this be true, I request that you desist from your purpose.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>Asuncion Fuentebella answered the foregoing letter on the 19th of the same month and year in the following words:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"Regarding my idea of setting out coco palms, you are misinformed; I am not thinking of setting out coco palms, as you state, on lands belonging to your parents.\"<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>Under date of December 29 of the same year 1909, Asuncion Fuentebella appears in a public document as the vendee of all the land included in that inscribed information the vendors being the brother and sister Juan and Sotera Cano, who in said document state nothing more than the following: \"This land has been quietly and peacefully possessed by our late parents for thirty years prior to this date.\" Thirty years preceeding this date, which is December 29, 1909, are the years that have elapsed since 1879.<\/p> <p>In view of this attitude of Asuncion Fuentebella, Ramon Ortiz filed the present complaint, wherein he asks for restitution of the possession of said parcel of land and P200 as damages.<\/p> <p>Asuncion Fuentebella cited Juan and Sotera Cano in defense of the title. She answered the complaint on August 21, 1911, and said that she had been in possession of the said land for more than two years and that she had set out thereon over 5,000 coco palms and built a house, wherefore she prayed that either the complaint be dismissed, or that the plaintiff pay her P8,000 Philippine currency for the coco palms set out and the house built. The vendors, Cano and his sister, substantiated their possession from the time of inheriting the property from their parents to the time of the sale; and subsidiarily, should this defense fail, they alleged prescription in favor of the defendant Fuentebella.<\/p> <p>After examining both the oral and documentary evidence the Court of First Instance of Ambos Camarines absolved the defendant from the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff, who appealed from the judgment.<\/p> <p>Asuncion Fuentebella cannot make her personal possession prevail over the possession inscribed in the property registry in favor of Ramon Ortiz, it having lasted only two years before she filed her answer to the complaint. Primarily and personally the defendant has no right beyond what she has derived from Juan and Sotera Cano.<\/p> <p>With reference to Juan and Sotera Cano's possession, the trial court's conclusions are: That these Cano defendants have not really and materially possessed a great part of the land; that Felipe Cano, the father of these defendants, had a house built on the tract, and probably exercised acts of possession over the land in the immediate neighborhood of the house and its vicinity by setting out fruit trees on a part thereof and now claims to have exercised such acts of possession over the whole of the land in question, which was only planted in breadfruits and coco palms around his house (B. of E. 15); that said land was not utilized during this time, except for what said heirs of Felipe Cano had there, consisting in some plantations of coco palms. (Ibid., 13.)<\/p> <p>As for the law on this point, the court reached the two following conclusions:<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"2. That Felipe Cano was in possession of <em>part<\/em> of the land during his lifetime and that after his death this possession passed to his children, two of whom are Juan and Sotera Cano.<\/p> <p>\"3. That Juan and Sotera Cano in the year 1908 sold this land to the defendant Asuncion Fuentebella, who then took possession thereof and has held it to date. At the time of this transfer to the defendant Fuentebella, Juan Cano and Sotera Cano were in possession of the land as heirs of their father Felipe Cano; but the heirs of Felipe Cano have not joined with those herein cited to defend the title, Juan Cano and Sotera Cano, in this sale nor have they appeared as parties and this court holds that their rights were not transferred by their brother and sister Juan and Sotera Cano to the defendant Asuncion Fuentebella.\" (B. of E., 16.)<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>From this it appears that neither Felipe Cano in his lifetime nor his children after his death possessed in the place called Tagas more space than was occupied by their house and their small plantations of breadfruit and coco palms around it, that is to say, merely a portion of the tract of 27 hectares in question, not all of it; and that, consequently, they could not sell to Fuentebella more than the space occupied by the house and some small plantations of breadfruit and coco palms, and of this small part only their hereditary portions, not those which on that hypothesis should pertain to their coheirs.<\/p> <p>Reviewing the evidence, we find the following facts:<\/p> <p>Sotera Cano and Juan Cano stated that they had other brothers living, Bernabe and Potenciano Cano, and also some nephews, the children of other brothers now deceased; and, according to Juan Cano, the vendee Fuentebella was acquainted with this fact.<\/p> <p>Juan Pe\u00f1a, witness for the defendant, a man of 68 years of age and brother-in-law of Felipe Cano, stated that the latter had had his house in Tagas \"a little outside the land in question, although his plantation of breadfruit trees was within the land in question\" (p. 36); that he had had nothing but a house and that it had been destroyed; that Felipe Cano had been dead for over thirty years, for the witness was then only a boy, \"a child still,\" according to his own words; that after Felipe Cano had died and the house had been destroyed, his widow did not rebuild it, but that his heirs \"went to live on the other side of the Mitil Creek, whither they <em>changed<\/em> their residence\" (pp. 41 and 42); and the person who went to live in the place they left was Cipriano Compuesto, who built his house there; that Don Ramon Ortiz had carabaos and cattle there from the time of the Spanish Government; and that on the land in question there are coco palms that were planted by Cipriano Compuesto beside his house.<\/p> <p>This testimony of a witness for the defendant, a resident of the place where the land in question is located, is of the greatest importance, since it amounts to confirmation of what already, on page 7, the plaintiff had testified, to wit, that in the year 1882 Cipriano Compuesto, with his consent, had set out coco palms in the place where his cattle pen (the plaintiff's) was constructed\u2014that is, in the place where, from what the witness Juan Pe\u00f1a says, Felipe Cano's destroyed house had been; and that the plaintiff had allowed Cipriano Compuesto to set out those coco palms on condition that if he did not remain on the land he would have to sell them, as indeed happened, those coco palms set out by Compuesto now belonging to the plaintiff. Already, on page 6, the plaintiff had also declared that one of the western boundaries of the land in question, as appears in the information inscribed in the registry, was the land of Maria Pagueo, which passed to Cipriano Compuesto so that in the plan Exhibit B of the plaintiff, Cipriano Compuesto appears as the owner of the land that adjoins it on the west; and if, as the witness Juan Pe\u00f1a states, Cipriano Compuesto built his house in the very same place where Felipe Cano had his, <em>a little outside the land in question,<\/em> and that his plantation of breadfruits was on the land in question, and Compuesto also set out his coco palms on the said land with the plaintiff's permission, the consequence is that Felipe Cano's house represents nothing else than Cipriano Compuesto's, and the breadfruit trees of Felipe Cano nothing else than Cipriano Compuesto's coco palms\u2014that is to say, that both houses were \"a little outside the place in question\" and that merely the plantation of breadfruit trees of the one and of coco palms of the other were those on the land in question, Compuesto's planting of coco palms, which later passed to the plaintiff, being by permission of the latter.<\/p> <p>So the following findings of fact are to be regarded as established upon the foregoing evidence: (1) That Felipe Cano, the predecessor in interest of the Cano defendants, did not have his house on the land in question, but a little outside of it, and that on it he had only his plantation of coco palms; (2) that his house was built on the same place that later came to be Maria Pagueo's land, conterminous on the west with the land in question, according to the possessory information; (3) that this same land of Maria Pagueo became Cipriano Compuesto's, and it appears in the plan (Exhibit B), made in 1892, as conterminous on the west with the land in question, and of the latter Cipriano occupied only the place planted in coco palms.<\/p> <p>Hence, if Felipe Cano's house had not been destroyed and his heirs had not moved their residence to the other side of the Mitil Creek and had remained in the same place in 1892, their land would have appeared as conterminous on the west with the land in question, instead of Maria Pagueo's in the possessory information and instead of Cipriano Compuesto's in the plan Exhibit B.<\/p> <p>Consequently, in 1892, the date of the possessory information, they were not the possessors of the land in question but only perhaps possessors of a tract of land conterminous with it on the west. But they could not have continued even to be the possessors in 1892 of this adjoining land on the west, because, according to the testimony of their own witness, Juan Pe\u00f1a, when their father Felipe Cano died, they changed their residence to the other side of the Mitil Creek, and their father's death, according to the same witness, occurred when even he was young; hence it is not hazardous to conclude that in 1870 he was no longer alive, and that in 1882 either Maria Pagueo or surely Cipriano Compuesto was on the adjoining land. At all events it has been very convincingly proved that neither in 1892 nor in 1882 nor in 1870 nor at any time did Felipe Cano and his children possess the land that is the subject matter of the present litigation, and that at the death of Felipe Cano and after the house located a little outside of the disputed land had been destroyed his heirs did not continue to live there but moved their residence to the other side of the Mitil Creek.<\/p> <p>Sotera Cano testifies that outside this disputed land, toward the west at some 600 or 800 <em>brazas<\/em> from its boundary, they had a coco-palm grove and <em>there they had their house,<\/em> beside which they also had the plantations which they had inherited from their father Felipe Cano, this being the only house they had in that place, and in which they were living at the time of their father's death; that she was acquainted with the three persons, among them Maria Pagueo, whose lands were conterminous on the west with the disputed land, all three of which persons had their plantations. \"These plantations,\" she adds, \"are <em>between<\/em> our plantations\" (p. 57). And Juan Cano says that when their father died they built <em>the house located in the coco-palm grove;<\/em> that coming from these coco palms where they were living to the <em>visita<\/em> (or barrio there is on the land) one had to cross a creek called Mitil and that \"according to <em>his belief<\/em> the disputed land is the <em>coco-palm grove<\/em> where their house is located beside the plantations toward the west of the <em>visita'<\/em> (p. 68).<\/p> <p>This belief or, as now shown, error of Juan Cano is the cause of all the other errors that have given rise to this suit.<\/p> <p>To offset the possession attested by the registered possessory information it has not been proven in any way that either at the date of its inscription in 1892 or in 1882 or in 1879 could Felipe Cano or his children Juan and Sotera Cano have been in possession of the disputed land; and if the complaint was dismissed it was solely on the basis of the incorrect hypothesis that \"at the time when the plaintiff obtained this title of possessory information, Felipe Cano, father of the persons herein cited to defend the title, Juan and Sotera Cano, or they themselves if he was dead, were in possession of said land or a part thereof.\" (B. of E., 15.) It has been clearly demonstrated that in 1879 Felipe Cano was already dead and that at his death and after the destruction of his house built on the border of the disputed land his children changed their residence and went to live on the other side of the Mitil creek, some 600 or 700 <em>brazas<\/em> from those borders, with plantations between, or with plantations between of the three persons named in the possessory information as adjoining on the west, among these Maria Pagueo.<\/p> <p>The authenticity and efficacy of the possessory information having been proven by means of its inscription in the registry, and not impugned, restitution must be ordered of the possession claimed by the plaintiff, and also of the land in question, with the costs against the defendants. Consequently, the judgment appealed from, in so far as it dismisses the complaint, must be reversed.<\/p> <p>With reference to the counterclaim set up by the defendant Asuncion Fuentebella, only the following facts have been proved:<\/p> <p>That the defendant has been in possession of the land claimed in the complaint for only about two years from the date of the answer thereto, since August 21, 1911, that is, since some time before August 21, 1909;<\/p> <p>That from the document she has presented in evidence she does not appear to have purchased the land claimed in the complaint until December 29, 1909, after she had already been warned by the plaintiff's daughter in March of that year not to set out coco palms on said land as it belonged to the latter's father;<\/p> <p>That, if what the defendant and her witness Sotera Cano state is true, the sale was closed in 1908, but the document had not been drawn up until the price agreed upon had been paid;<\/p> <p>That, according to the testimony of Juan Cano, the defendant purchased the land from Juan Cano and Sotera Cano, knowing perfectly that there were other coheirs, that is, their two brothers and various nephews whose number was not definitely stated;<\/p> <p>That Juan Pe\u00f1a, witness for the defendant, states that Ramon Ortiz has had cattle and carabaos since the time of the Spanish Government, while it has been seen that, according to this same witness, Felipe Cano had land in Tagas, not the land in question, but a little outside that land; and his children, not the same land their father had occupied, for this was later Cipriano Compuesto's, but some coco-palm groves distant 600 or 800 <em>brazas<\/em> to the west of the disputed land, whither they had moved their residence, it thus very clearly appearing in this suit that all this litigation has been maintained on a false basis, which is the belief of the defendant Juan Cano that the land now in question is exactly this coco-palm grove where his house is located beside the plantations to the west of the <em>visita,<\/em> or of the settlement formed on the land of Ramon Ortiz.<\/p> <p>These facts being admitted, the defendants called to support the title have been unable to justify the sale they made of the land in question to Asuncion Fuentebella.<\/p> <p>Did Asuncion Fuentebella possess the land in good faith? That is the point to be determined in the counterclaim.<\/p> <p>It has not been proved that the defendant Asuncion Fuentebella has acted in pursuance of some evil plan in conjunction with her witness Irineo Pe\u00f1as, who along with his father had from childhood been and after the latter's death continued to be the herdsman of the plaintiff's cattle on the land in question and was dismissed by the latter on account of his disloyalty and bad conduct. Now it appears that he is the principal laborer of the defendant in setting out coco palms.<\/p> <p>However it be, we do not regard as decisive the evidence presented to prove that the defendant's possession was in bad faith. The nullity of the greater part of her title is not sufficient argument to prove that she knew of the defect in her mode of acquisition of a tract of land as belonging to Juan and Sotera Cano, when it is now demonstrated in this case that neither Sotera, nor Juan Cano, nor even their father Felipe Cano, had at any time possessed it, but another tract in the neighborhood, possession whereof might easily have caused error on the part of the purchaser. Defendant's bad faith began after the warning given in a letter by the plaintiff's daughter in March, 1909, for after having received it she then had ground to doubt that Sotera and Juan Cano could transfer any title of possession in the following December.<\/p> <blockquote> <p>\"Possession acquired in good faith does not lose this character, except in the case and from the moment that the possessor is aware that he possesses the thing illegally.\" (Civil Code, art. 435.)<\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>The trial court has declared that it encountered a good deal of difficulty in deciding whether the coco palms had been set out before or after the receipt of the said letter, but it believes that, in view of the evidence, a large portion of the land, but not the whole, was already so planted; that the house was under construction but unfinished; and that \"there is no other evidence in the case regarding the value of said house or the value of the coco palms, except what has been stated by the defendant.\" (B. of E., 14.) Everything done on the land, expenditures, outlay, improvements, <em>from the moment<\/em> when the letter was received bears the stamp of having been carried out when the possessor was not unaware that she was improperly in possession of the land. In the light of this holding must be determined all the questions that arise concerning the effects of the defendant's possession and the rights she is entitled to under the provisions of the Civil Code with respect to the house and the coco palms that have led to her counterclaim, once it has been ordered in this decision that possession of the land be restored to the plaintiff.<\/p> <p>The judgment is reversed in so far as it absolves the defendants from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.<\/p> <p>Let possession of the land described in the second paragraph of the complaint be restored to the plaintiff, with the costs in first instance against the defendants, and without special finding with respect to those of this instance.<\/p> <p>Let the case be returned to the lower court so that it may fix exactly the time when the construction and planting were carried out and determine and declare the rights and obligations of each of the litigating parties, after weighing the evidence already adduced and what may be newly taken, in so far as pertinent.<\/p> <em>Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/> <br\/> <br\/> <hr align=\"center\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/> <p align=\"center\"><em>CONCURRING<\/em><\/p> <p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p> <p>I agree with the decision except in so far as it returns the case for further evidence.<\/p><\/div>",

The plaintiff alleged that he was the owner and had been in \nthe quiet and peaceable possession of said parcel of land from the year 1897 to \nthe year 1901; that in the year 1901 the defendants illegally and unlawfully \ndispossessed him and have remained in the possession of said land ever since. \nThe plaintiff prayed for a judgment for the possession of the land and damages \nfor the illegal possession of the same in the sum of P2,000, and the costs.\n<p>To the complaint the defendants demurred, which was overruled by the lower \ncourt.<\/p>\n<p>Later the defendants answered by a general denial.<\/p>\n<p>After hearing the evidence the lower court found that the plaintiff was the \nowner of the land, and rendered a judgment directing the sheriff to put him in \nthe possession of the same and decreed that the defendants, Hermenegildo \nCostales, Isaac Costales, Francisco Torres, Regino Pontillas, and Julian \nViernes, should pay, jointly and severally, to the plaintiff the sum of P500 as \ndamages for the use and occupation of said land, together with interest thereon \nat the rate of six per cent, from the first day of September, 1908.<\/p>\n<p>From that judgment the defendants appealed to this court.<\/p>\n<p>The record shows that the defendant, Dionisio Costales, after the \ncommencement of the action and before the answer was filed, died. No answer was \npresented by his personal representatives or his heirs.<\/p>\n<p>The record also shows that Francisco Torres, after the commencement of the \npresent action, sold all of his alleged interest in the land in question. The \nrecord does not show the name of his vendee, neither does it show that his \nvendee entered into the possession of his (Francisco Torres') parcel of land. \nThe vendee of Francisco Torres not having been made a party to the present \naction, of course his interest cannot be affected by the conclusions reached in \nthis decision.<\/p>\n<p>From an examination of the record brought to this court with due reference to \nthe different assignments of error made by the plaintiff, we are of the opinion \nthat the pre ponderance of the evidence shows that the plaintiff is the owner of \nthe land in question and is entitled to the possession of the same as against \nthe defendants, Hermenegildo Costales, Isaac Costales, Regino Pontillas, arid \nJulian Viernes.<\/p>\n<p>The lower court found that the plaintiff has been damaged by the use and \noccupation on the part of the defendants of said land in the sum of F600. We \nthink that the pre-ponderance of the evidence adduced during the trial of the \ncause shows that the defendants were occupying the land in question in good \nfaith. The record shows that at the time they entered upon the possession of \nsaid land, they did so believing that they had a right to the possession of it. \nThat part of the judgment of the lower court must therefore be reversed.<\/p>\n<p>One of the assignments of error presented by the appellant is that the lower \ncourt committed an error in overruling the demurrer presented by them. By that \nassignment of error the appellants allege that the facts stated in the petition \nof the plaintiff were not sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The test \nof the sufficiency of the facts found in a petition to constitute a cause of \naction is whether or not, admitting the facts alleged, the court could render a \nvalid judgment upon the same, in accordance with the prayer of the petition. In \nthe present case the plaintiff alleged two facts: (1) That he was the owner of \nthe land; and (2) that the defendants had illegally dispossessed him of the \nsame. Upon these facts he prayed that the defendants be required to return to \nhim the possession of said land and to pay damages. Admitting the facts alleged \nto be true, the plaintiff was clearly entitled to the relief prayed for. We find \nthat the lower court committed no error in overruling the demurrer.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, in accordance with the foregoing, it is hereby ordered and decreed \nthat a judgment be entered affirming that part of the judgment of the lower \ncourt which declares that the plaintiff is the owner of the land in question and \nentitled to the possession of the same, and that part of the judgment of the \nlower court which requires the defendants to pay to the plaintiff the sum of \nP500, together with interest, is hereby reversed.

In pursuance of the provisions of section 68 of Act No. 1459, known as \nthe Corporation Law, the appellant company, prior to the beginning of the action \nwhich culminated in the judgment complained of, had filed in the division of \narchives a written statement under oath containing, among other things, the name \nof an agent residing in the Philippine Islands authorized by the corporation to \naccept service of summons and processes in all local proceedings against the \ncorporation and of all notices affecting it. The summons in the action in which \nthe judgment was entered was admittedly no served on the agent so named by the \ncorporation but upon a person who was, the appellant claims, simply an employee \nthereof.<\/p>\n<p>There is much discussion by counsel as to whether or not the person upon whom \nthe summons was actually served was, under section 396 of the Code of Civil \nProcedure, the \"managing agent\" or said corporation. We do not believe it \nnecessary to enter upon a consideration of that matter. We are of the opinion \nthat, where a foreign corporation has designated a person to receive service of \nsummons in judicial proceedings and other notices affecting the corporation, \nthat designation is exclusive and that service of summons is without force or \neffect unless made upon him. Where such a person has been designated, section \n396 of the Code of Civil Procedure above referred to is not applicable, and the \nonly person upon whom summons can be served is the person so designated. Where, \nhowever, the foreign corporation has neglected or refused to designate such a \nperson, then the provisions of section 396 of the Code of Civil Procedure and \nsection 72 of Act No. 1459 are applicable and control the service.<\/p>\n<p>It being undisputed that the foreign corporation had, prior to the beginning \nof the action, designated the person upon whom summons should be served, and it \nbeing also undisputed that the summons in the action in which the judgment \ncomplained of was entered was not served upon that person, it necessarily \nfollows that the summons was not served in accordance with the law and that the \ncourt, therefore, obtained no jurisdiction over the person of the appellant. It \nnot appearing from the record that jurisdiction was obtained by the voluntary \ngeneral appearance of the appellant in the action, the court in entering the \njudgment lacked jurisdiction over the person of the appellant and its judgment \nwas accordingly subject to attack upon that ground.<\/p>\n<p>Where judgment is defective by reason of the failure of service of summons \nupon the defendant, it may be attacked by motion made to set it aside. The \nmotion in this case was properly made and should have been sustained. <\/p>\n<p>The judgment [order] appealed from is reversed and the judgment in \ncontroversy is set aside and declared of no force and effect.

A complaint was presented by the prosecuting attorney charging Marcelina \nBantog with having defrauded Quintina Reyes of various jewels, described in said \ncomplaint, and which the accused received to sell on commission for P400, tfhe \nvalue thereof, obligating herself to return them to their owner in case they \nshould not be sold, or in case of their sale to deliver the price thereof. \nInstead of carrying out the contract Bantog fraudulently disposed Of said jewels \nfor her own profit and advantage and to the prejudice of the aggrieved party by \npawning theni in the pawnshops of Antonio Matute &amp; Co., Geronimo Sanchez, \nGuillermo F. Ruiz, and Fausto 0. Raymundo, as appears from the pawn tickets Nos. \n49427 and 49297 of Matute'.s pawnshop; No. 28402 of Raymundo's; No. 12497 of \nRuiz'; and No. 5128 of that of Geronimo A. Sanchez.\n<p>Upon arraignment the accused pleaded guilty and the court upon the merits of \nthe case sentenced her to the penalty of four months and one day of <em>arresto \nmayor,<\/em> to pay an indemnity of P400 to the injured party, and in case of \ninsolvency to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, provided that the \nlatter should not exceed a third of the principal penalty, and the payment of \nthe costs. The accused did not appeal and on November 19, 1913, began to serve \nher sentence.<\/p>\n<p>By a written motion of November 20, of the same year, counsel for the injured \nparty, the owner of the said jewels, petitioned that, in accordance with the \nprovisions of article 120 of the Penal Code, the owners of the four pawnshops \nmentioned be directed to restore the jewels described in the petition without \nany indemnity on the part of the petitioner.<\/p>\n<p>The said pawnbrokers, Antonio Matute, Geronimo Sanchez, Guillermo F. Ruiz, \nand Fausto 0. Raymundo, were notified and summoned to appear at the hearing of \nthe motion at 8 o'clock a. m. on November 26,1913, and, as none of them \nappeared, the court by order of the same date directed that they deliver to \nQuintina Reyes, without indemnity on her part, the jewels specified in said \norder. When the pawn-brokers had been informed of this decision, Geronimo \nSanchez, according to the statement of counsel for the offended party, returned \nto her the jewels referred to in pawn ticket No. 5128, but counsel for Guillermo \nF. Ruiz, Fausto 0. Raymundo, and Antonio Matute appealed to this court and in \ntheir brief asked that the said order be set aside with the costs against the \nappellee, alleging that the lower court erred in ordering restitution of the \njewels in question without due indemnification; that it also erred in accepting \nas a fact that said jewels were pawned in their shops, without the corresponding \npawn tickets having been exhibited as proof; and, finally, that it erred in \nordering restitution of the jewels without due process of law.<\/p>\n<p>It is beyond dispute that the jewels referred to in the pawn tickets issued \nby the pawnshops of Guillermo F. Ruiz, Fausto 0. Raymundo, and Antonio Matute, \nwhich were the subject matter of the estafa committed by the accused and \nconvicted party, Marcelina Bantog, were the property of Quintina Reyes, who \ndelivered them to Bantog for sale, with the obligation of returning them if they \nwere not sold; but the latter, acting in bad faith, converted and disposed of \nsaid jewels by pawning them with the appellants, without the knowledge of their \nlawful owner and to her prejudice; and, moreover, the perpetrator of the estafa \nkept the money received from pawning the jewels.<\/p>\n<p>Among the civil responsibilities incurred by a person committing estafa there \nappears in the first place, according to article 119 of the Penal Code, that of \nrestoring the thing taken. <\/p>\n<p>Article 120 of the same Code says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The restitution of the thing itself must be made, if possible, with payment \nfor deterioration or diminution of value to be appraised by the court.<\/p>\n<p>\"Restitution shall be made, even though the thing may be in the possession of \na third person, who had acquired it in a legal manner, reserving, however, his \naction against the proper person.<\/p>\n<p>\"This provision is not applicable to a case in which the third person has \nacquired the thing in the manner and with the requisites established by law to \nmake it unrecoverable.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>According to the text of the foregoing article the jewels were not acquired \nby the appellants in the manner and with the legal requisites that would make \nthem unrecoverable under the provisions of article 464 of the Civil Code. The \njewels were pawned without the consent of their owner, to her fraud and \nprejudice, and must be restored by the appellants even though they acquired them \nunder a legal contract and notwithstanding the fact that they are third parties \nwith respect to the agreement between the owner of the jewels and the accused, \nfor they are under a definite obligation to restore them to their owner without \nany obligation on her part to make good the amount for which they were pawned, \nand for which the three appellants can make demand upon the accused who \nappropriated them to her own benefit.<\/p>\n<p>The provision of law is positive and there is no sound reason for failure on \nthe part of the appellants to obey it, and it has always been thus observed in \nvarious similar cases decided by this court, as may be seen in the decisions in \nthe cases of Varela <em>vs.<\/em> Matute (9 Phil. Rep., 479) and Varela \n<em>vs.<\/em> Finnick (9 Phil. Rep., 482).<\/p>\n<p>It is to be noted that when the appellants were summoned in due form to the \nhearing upon the motion presented by the appellee, who was entering claim for \nthe jewels, not only did they not allege any reason against the claim of the \nowner of the jewels, but they did not even appear in the court when the hearing \ntook place.<\/p>\n<p>The indemnity ordered in the judgment is understood in the case that \nrestitution of the jewels would be impossible, as the order established for \nmaking effective the responsibility under article 119 of the Code is: first, \nrestitution; second, reparation for the injury; and third, indemnity. <\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the order appealed \nfrom are deemed to have been refuted, it is proper to affirm the order, as we \nhereby do, with the costs in equal parts against the appellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

On the 9th \nday of December, 1910, upon a petition presented for that purpose, Prospero K. \nAlafriz was appointed as administrator of the estate of the deceased Gregorio \nNavarro, by the judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Ilocos \nSur. It appears in said order (9th of December, 1910) that the said Gregorio \nNavarro at the time of his death, left some minor children, a widow, and \nproperty, real and personal. On the said 9th day of December, 1910, the court \nappointed the widow of the said Gregorio Navarro as the guardian of some of the \nminor children.\n<p>It appears that the said administrator (Prospero K. Alafriz) duly qualified \nas said administrator on the 10th day of March, 1911, and presented a motion in \nthe Court of First Instance alleging that the said Pia Mina had in her \npossession a certain document or paper or receipt for certain jewelry deposited \nby Gregorio Navarro, before his death, as security for a loan obtained from one \nSalvador Rivero and his wife. Upon the facts stated in this motion, the \nadministrator asked that Pia Mina be cited to appear in court for the purpose of \nshowing whether she had such paper, document or receipt in her possession.<\/p>\n<p>On the 13th day of March, 1911, the Honorable Dionisio Chanco, judge, after \nconsidering said motion, issued an order citing Pia Mina to appear in court, \nupon the 22d day of March, 1911, at 8 o'clock a. m., for the purpose of \nanswering the allegations of said motion.<\/p>\n<p>On the said 22d day of March, 1911, Pia Mina appeared in court. After hearing \nthe respective parties, the judge, on the same day, ordered her to deliver to \nthe clerk of the court the paper or document mentioned in said motion.<\/p>\n<p>On the 23d day of March, 1911, the said Pia Mina complied with the order of \nthe court and deposited with the clerk of the court the pawn ticket, No. 243. At \nthe same time she presented her exception to the order of the court directing \nher to deliver said ticket to the clerk. She also alleged that she and her \nmother were the real owners of the jewelry pawned.<\/p>\n<p>On the 28th day of March, 1911, after said document No. 243 had been \ndelivered to the clerk, the court directed the administrator to deposit with the \nclerk the sum of P160, the amount of the loan obtained by the deceased Gregorio \nNavarro, for which said jewelry had been deposited as security, and directed the \nclerk to redeem the said jewelry and to keep it deposited in his (the clerk's) \noffice until the final settlement of the estate. On the same day (the 28th of \nMarch, 1911) the clerk complied with the order of the court and redeemed the \njewelry in question.<\/p>\n<p>On the 8th day of April, 1911, Pia Mina presented a motion asking that the \njewelry represented by the pawn ticket, No. 243, be excluded from the inventory \npresented by the administrator. Said motion was brought on for hearing on the \n28th day of April, 1911.<\/p>\n<p>At said hearing Pia Mina offered to present proof for the purpose of showing \nthat said jewelry belonged to her and her mother, to which offer the \nadministrator presented an objection, which objection was sustained by the \ncourt, and the defendant duly excepted.<\/p>\n<p>Some time after said hearing, and on the 22d day of April, 1912, the lower \ncourt made the following order: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In deciding the written motion of the objector Pia Mina, praying for the \nremoval of the administrator appointed in present case, the court denies the \npetition and enjoins obedience to its orders of December 9, 1010, and March \n28,1911. The administrator may bring such actions against Pia Mina as he may \ndeem necessary and the rights of which pertain to the intestate estate of which \nhe is the administrator, and against this latter the objector, Pia Mina, \nlikewise may institute such action Or actions as she may consider proper. The \njewels deposited shall, however, continue to remain in the office of the clerk \nof the court until the right of possession and ownership thereof shall have been \ndecided by a competent court.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is further ordered that the objector Pia Mina shall comply with her \nobligation to furnish bond for the proper discharge of her duties as guardian of \nher minor children, 'Dolores, Isidro, Salud, and Maximina, as previously ordered \nin this case.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is likewise ordered that the administrator shall present a detailed \ninventory which complies with all the requirements prescribed by law, shall \nrefer accounts and take all steps that may be necessary by law for the due \nsettlement of the intestate estate and the speedy termination of all proceedings \nin connection therewith.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From the foregoing order the defendant duly excepted and appealed to this \ncourt. In this court the appellant presented the following assignments of \nerror:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I. The trial court erred in granting the petition of the administrator's \ncounsel by summoning Pia Mina to testify in connection with the pawned \njewels.<\/p>\n<p>\"II. The lower court erred in ordering Pia Mina to present the pawn ticket of \nthe aforementioned jewels.<\/p>\n<p>\"III. The court erred in ordering the clerk of the court to redeem the said \npawned jewels and keep them in custody in the court.<\/p>\n<p>\"IV. The court erred in not permitting the introduction of evidence relative \nto the ownership of the said jewels.<\/p>\n<p>\"V. The court erred in not ordering the exclusion of the said jewels from the \ninventory presented by the administrator. <\/p>\n<p>\"VI. The court erred in not removing Prospero K. Alafriz from his office of \nadministrator, and in not appointing Pia Mina in his stead.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In support of the first assignment of error, the appellant contends that \nthere is no law justifying the order made by the lower court, citing her to \nappear and to declare concerning the question whether she had property belonging \nto the estate. She also contends that the administrator should have proceeded by \nan ordinary action, if he believed that she had in her possession property of \nthe estate. She also alleges that the notice of the hearing on said motion was \nnot served on her in accordance with the rules of the court. As to the last \ncontention she made no objection in the court below. She appeared without \nobjection. We cannot, therefore, consider that question now.<\/p>\n<p>The appellee did not present a brief here.<\/p>\n<p>In answer to the contention of the appellant that there is no law justifying \nthe citation of the defendant in a testamentary proceeding, we find that section \n709 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions (Act No. 190) expressly authorizes \nthe order of which complaint is made. Section 709 provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If any executor or administrator, heir, legatee, creditor, or other person \ninterested in the estate of a deceased person complains to the court having \njurisdiction of the estate, that a person is suspected of having concealed, \nembezzled, or conveyed away any of the money, goods, or chattels of the \ndeceased, or that such person has in his possession, or has knowledge of any \ndeed, conveyance, bond, contract, or other writing which contains evidence of, \nor tends to disclose the right, title, interest or claim of the deceased to real \nor personal estate, or the last will and testament of the deceased, the court \nmay cite such suspected person to appear before it, and may examine him on oath \non the matter of such complaint; if the person so cited refuses to appear and \nanswer such examination, or to answer such interrogatories as are put to him, \nthe court may, by warrant, commit him to the jail or prison of the province, \nthere to remain in close custody until he submits to the order of the court; and \nsuch interrogatories and answers shall be in writing and signed by the party \nexamined, and filed in the clerk's office.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We think said section (709) fully justifies the order made by the lower court \nciting the appellant to appear, and that no error was committed in making said \norder.<\/p>\n<p>The second, third, and fourth assignments of error, we think may be \nconsidered together.<\/p>\n<p>In support of the second assignment of error, the appellant alleges that the \njewelry in question, which had been pawned and which was represented by the pawn \nticket, belonged to her. She contends, when the court ordered the jewelry taken \nfrom her possession and turned over to the clerk, that she had been deprived of \nher property without a hearing. She alleges, and the record supports her \nallegation, that she requested the court to permit her to present proof of her \nownership of the jewels, and that the court refused to hear her proof. (See B. \nof Ex., p. 33.) So far as the record shows, the only proof which the court had, \nindicating who the owner was, was the pawn ticket itself. The pawn ticket showed \nthat it had been issued to the deceased Gregorio Navarro. That fact, perhaps, \nconstituted prima facie proof of ownership, but it certainly was not absolute \nproof of ownership. The lower court not only ordered the appellant to turn the \npawn ticket over to the clerk, but also ordered the administrator to pay to the \nclerk the sum of P160, with which to redeem said jewels. In accordance with the \norder of the court, the clerk did actually redeem said jewels and now has them \nin his possession. All this was done without permitting the appellant to be \nheard upon the question of her alleged ownership. If the jewels did, in fact, \nbelong to the appellant then, of course, the court had no right to deprive her \nof the pawn ticket, nor to use the funds of the estate in redeeming them.<\/p>\n<p>There is nothing in section 709 which justifies the orders complained of in \nthe second and third assignments of error. Said section (709) simply provides \nthat \"the court may cite such suspected person to appear before it and may \nexamine him on oath on the matter of such complaint.\" There is nothing in the \nsection which authorizes the court to take possession of the property, if any \nshould be found in the possession of the defendant or of the person cited. If, \nupon the hearing, there was good reason for believing that the person cited had \nproperty in his or her possession belonging to the estate, then it was the duty \nof the administrator to proceed by an ordinary action to recover possession of \nthe same. There may be cases, where papers and documentary evidence of ownership \nof property are held by a third person belonging to the estate of a deceased \nperson, in which it would be perfectly proper for the court to order the same \nturned over to the court. We do not now, however, attempt in any way to indicate \nwhat would be such a condition nor even to finally decide that such a condition \nmight exist. In the present case the defendant was entitled to retain possession \nof the pawn ticket, until the question of the ownership of the jewels should be \ndetermined in the proper way. The court had no right to deprive her of her \nevidence relating to the property, until the question of ownership had been \nsettled.<\/p>\n<p>The order of the court of the 22d of April, 1912; directed the administrator \nto commence an ordinary action against Pia Mina to recover said jewels, and \nuntil that action was concluded, the clerk should retain possession of the same. \nIn said order the court expressly refused to pass upon the question of \nownership. This order, it would seem, was not authorized in the proceedings then \npending, neither was the order directing the administrator to pay, out of the \nfunds of the estate, the amount necessary to redeem the jewels, until the \nquestion of ownership had been settled. No complaint, however, is here made by \nany one, relating to that order. That part of the order may properly be \nconsidered when the administrator renders his account. If, however, the estate \nor Pia Mina has been damaged by said order, such damages may, perhaps, be \nsettled in an action brought for the purpose of determining the ownership of the \njewels. For the present we are not inclined to revoke said order. It may finally \nappear that the jewels actually belonged to the estate and not to Pia Mina. In \nthat case the jewels will then be where they can be turned over to the \nadministrator without further delay.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the fourth assignment of error, the record shows that the \nlower court refused, after hearing the defendant, to allow her to present \nfurther proof concerning the ownership of the jewels in question. Section 709 \ndoes not seem to make provision for the determination of the right of ownership \nof property. Said section provides that the person suspected of having property \nbelonging to the estate, may be cited, and the court may examine such person, \nunder oath, on the matter of such property. The section further provides that \nsuch interrogatories and answers shall be in writing, and signed by the party \nexamined, and <em>filed in the clerk's office.<\/em> It will be observed that the \nsection nowhere expressly gives the court the power to determine the right of \nproperty. The usual way of determining the right of contending parties to the \nownership of property is by instituting an ordinary action for that purpose. \nThis is true whether the property in question belongs to the estate of the \ndeceased person or not. (Chanco <em>vs.<\/em> Madrilejos and Abreu, 12 Phil. \nRep., 543.) We are confirmed in our belief that section 709 did not provide for \na trial of the right of property of a deceased person, embezzled or alienated by \na third person, by the provisions of section 711, which expressly provides for \nan ordinary action to recover property of a deceased person embezzled or \nalienated, etc., etc.<\/p>\n<p>The appellant argues, in support of the fifth assignment of error, that the \njewels in question should not have been placed in the inventory of the \nadministrator, until there was some positive proof showing that they belonged to \nthe estate. There is much merit in that contention, but the mere fact that the \nadministrator had placed them in his inventory in no way deprives the appellant \nof her property therein. She is still entitled to be heard upon the question of \nher ownership, when that question is properly presented to the court. The \nadministrator is responsible for what appears in his inventory. While the order \ncomplained of in this assignment of error (fifth) may have been erroneous in the \npresent case, yet we are of the opinion that, for the present, it in no way \nprejudices the rights of the appellant in her property. She can yet show that \nthe jewels belonged to her.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the sixth assignment of error, there is nothing in the \nrecord which shows that there was any just cause for the removal of the \nadministrator.<\/p>\n<p>While we are persuaded that some of the errors complained of were committed \nby the lower court, as we have indicated above, nevertheless, they are errors \nwhich may be corrected in subsequent proceedings and are therefore, for the \npresent, not prejudicial to the rights of the appellant. Therefore, without \nintending to legalize the order of the court directing the administrator to \nredeem the jewels out of the funds of the estate, nor in any way to affirm the \norder directing that the jewels be turned over to the clerk to be held by him \nuntil final settlement of the question of ownership, the judgment of the lower \ncourt is hereby affirmed, and without any finding as to costs, it is so \nordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

It also finds affirmatively \nthat the trial court has no authority with respect to property found in the \nhands of a third person by virtue of proceedings under section 709 of the Code \nof Civil Procedure; and that, where the court believes that said third person \nhas property belonging to the estate, it should order the administrator to bring \nan action to recover it. It has no power or authority, Without a trial and a \nhearing upon the merits, to require the third person to deliver the property \nalleged to belong to the estate to the administrator.<\/p>\n<p>Having found that the court erred and that it acted without authority of law \nin depriving the appellant of the property in question, the court does not, as \nwould seem natural and necessary, reverse the order and require the return of \nthe property to the appellant, but, rather, condones the act of the court, \nsaying:<br\/><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If, however, the estate or Pia Mina has been damaged by said order, such \ndamages may, perhaps, be settled in an action brought for the purpose of \ndetermining the owner ship of the jewels. For the present we are not inclined to \nrevoke said order. It may finally appear that the jewels actually belonged to \nthe estate and not to Pia Mina. In that case the jewels will then be where they \ncan be turned over to the administrator without further delay.\" and:<\/p>\n<p>\"While we are persuaded that some of the errors complained of were committed \nby the lower court, as we have indicated above, nevertheless, they are errors \nwhich may be corrected in subsequent proceedings and are therefore, for the \npresent, not prejudicial to the rights of the appellant.

To admit that the trial court committed \nerrors in its decision and then allege that \"they are errors which may be \ncorrected in subsequent proceedings,\" and, upon this allegation, refuse to \ncorrect them, when they are the very errors appealed from and are the very \nerrors assigned in and presented to this court for correction, and are the sole \nreason and basis of this appeal, is to pervert the purpose of appeals, to deny \nappellant the remedy which the law concedes, and to assume to name the cases in \nwhich the law of appeals shall apply.<\/p>\n<p>In my opinion the order depriving the appellant of her property without due \nprocess of law and against her objection, which order is expressly held \nerroneous by this court upon that ground, should be reversed and the property \nreturned to the appellant, where this court expressly finds it properly \nbelongs.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

In said month of January William Kane, the superintendent of the dredge, \nnoticed that there had been taken from the dredge a quantity of auriferous sand \nor amalgam which had been collected by the dredge, which contained about 500 \nounces of gold. On inspecting the depository where the tables were located upon \nwhich the gold-bearing sand or amalgam was treated, he noticed that one of the \ndoors which had been closed to prevent the ingress of water was open, that the \nboards composing it had been partly torn therefrom for the purpose of obtaining \nentrance, and that there were tracks where the persons forcing entrance had come \nand gone.<\/p>\n<p>On the 16th of January, 1913, at about 6.30 in the afternoon, Sotero Galero \nand Mariano Banal saw the appellant, Juan Yebra, together with Perfecto Lamadrid \nin Gumaus; Galero first saw him lying upon his face in a small house back of the \ndredge, while his companion carried a sack; Galero followed these two \nindividuals as they quitted the place where they were discovered, leaving Banal \nnear the dredge where he then was. The appellant and Lamadrid went to some \nbushes and from there to a small house belonging to Lucas Rojo. Galero followed \nthem and recognized Yebra as the man that was lying upon his face back of the \ndredge and Lamadrid as the one who carried the sack. As Galero passed in front \nof Rojo's house, Yebra asked him where he came from and he answered that he came \nfrom Iraya and was looking for work. Banal, after waiting for half an hour and \nGalero not returning, went to look for him and found him at Rojo's house talking \nwith Yebra and Lamadrid. Banal asserts that Yebra and Lamadrid were talking of \nthe sack of sand which they carried. After this conversation Yebra left, \nfollowed by Lamadrid carrying the sack. On that occasion Yebra was substantially \nnude, having nothing on but a <em>taparrabo,<\/em> which was wet Yebra, on \nleaving Rojo's house, left his hat there, which was found, upon examination, to \nbe thoroughly wet and to have upon it auriferous sand or sand with amalgam. \nGalero took the hat and hid it in some bushes and later carried it and the sand \nwhich it contained to the sergeant of police, who delivered it to Mr. Kane. The \nlatter found a considerable quantity of amalgam in the sand.<\/p>\n<p>The witness Marcelo Venita testified that Juan Yebra delivered to him some \nnuggets of gold from which he made for him some jewelry.<\/p>\n<p>There were filed in the case written confessions made by Juan Yebra, executed \nbefore a notary public. They were accepted over the objection of the accused. \nThey are alleged to have been procured by promises made by a police officer, who \nstated to the appellant that if he would make the confessions in question he \nwould see to it that nothing happened to him. This evidence is uncontradicted. \nFor this reason we regard the confessions as inadmissible. We do not believe, \nhowever, that the judgment of conviction should be reversed for this reason, as \nthere is abundant evidence, in our judgment, to sustain the conviction apart \nfrom these confessions. In addition to the evidence already referred to we have \nthe testimony of the chief of police, Rosalio Sendon, who testified that, while \nLamadrid and Yebra were in jail under his custody, a guard, Gregorio Fernandez, \ncame to him saying that the two prisoners wanted to speak to him.<\/p>\n<p>Upon going to them Lamadrid said: \"Chief Sendon, we want you to let us go \nfree because we warit to go away. If you will do this, we will give you whatever \nyou desire, because we feel very bad here.\" <\/p>\n<p>After further talk Sendon asked them what they were going to give him, and \nthey replied: \"We will give you jewelry and money to the amount of P60 and also \na carabao if you wish it.\"<\/p>\n<p>The witness then asked them where these things were that they proposed giving \nhim and they replied that they were in a place called Casalogan. He asked them \nwhere this place was and how they were going to get there and they told him \nwhere it was and assured him that they could go and come in two hours. The \nfollowing day the witness and the two prisoners went to the place designated and \nthere found the articles which the prisoners had mentioned. They were turned \nover to the witness. Upon receiving them he asked Lamadrid who had manufactured \nthe jewelry and he replied that Juan Yebra had procured it to be made by Marcejo \nVenida, a silversmith. In order to substantiate this assertion the witness went \nwith them to the silversmith, and he assured him that what the prisoners had \ntold him was true. This witness also testified that later Juan Yebra told him \nthat the gold which had gone to make up the jewelry referred to had been \nobtained from the dredge; that this statement of Juan Yebra was voluntary and \nwas without force, intimidation, deceit, or promise of any kind.<\/p>\n<p>We are satisfied that the judgment of conviction is correct and should be \nsustained.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the \nappellant.<br\/><br\/><em>Arellano, C, J., Carson, Trent,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, \nJJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

The action being at issue that \ncourt, in view of the large number of cases then pending for trial in that court \nand that sessions of the court would not be held in that province for several \nmonths, assigned the justice of the peace of the capital of the province to take \ncognizance of and try the cause in conformity with section 3 of Act No. 2041. On \nthe coming on of the cause for trial the plaintiff objected to the jurisdiction \nof the justice of the peace, alleging that the Act authorizing the appointment \nwas unconstitutional and void, that the Court of First Instance exceeded its \nauthority in making the assignment, and that the justice of the peace had no \njurisdiction or power to hear the cause.<\/p>\n<p>The justice of the peace overruled the objections of the plaintiff and \nordered the trial to proceed. The plaintiff, standing upon her objection, \nrefused to go forward with the trial, whereupon, on motion of the defendant, an \norder was entered finally dismissing the action. This appeal is from that \norder.<\/p>\n<p>That portion of Act No. 2041 referred to above reads as follows: \"That \njustices of the peace in provincial capitals, except in the city of Manila, may \nby assignment of the respective judge of the Court of First Instance in each \ncase have like jurisdiction within the province as the Court of First Instance \nto hear and determine cases originally cognizable by the Court of First Instance \nin which the subject of litigation is capable of pecuniary estimation and the \nvalue of the subject-matter or amount of the demand does not exceed two thousand \npesos exclusive of interest and costs, except cases involving the legality of \nany tax, impost, or assessment, or actions involving admiralty or maritime \njurisdiction.\" <\/p>\n<p>The appellant contends that a justice of the peace not having: jurisdiction \nto determine the title to real estate, has no power or authority to try the case \nat bar, one of the main questions being the ownership of the real estate which \nis the subject of the litigation.<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the appellant is in error. When authority is \ndelegated to the justice of the peace in the manner and under the circumstances \nspecified in the Act, he acts, in the trial of the particular cause to which he \nis assigned, as a Court of First Instance and not as a justice of the peace or a \njustice's court. The statute expressly authorizes the Court of First Instance, \nunder certain circumstances, to assign a justice of the peace of the provincial \ncapital to the trial of certain causes pending in the Court of First Instance; \nand such assignment confers upon him all of the power and authority necessary to \ndetermine the case. This being so, there is no foundation to the objection that \nthis case falls within that of Barrameda <em>vs.<\/em> Moir (25 Phil. Rep., 44), \nwhere it was held that Acts Nos. 2041 and 2131, \"in so far as they attempt to \nconfer exclusive jurisdiction or exclusive original jurisdiction upon courts of \njustices of the peace to try real-estate actions' where the amount involved does \nnot exceed P200, are void because they conflict with section 9 of the Philippine \nBill, which on firms the original jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance in \n'all civil actions which involve the title to or possession of real property, or \nof any interest therein,' as provided in Act, No.186, section 56, paragraph 2 of \nthe Philippine Commission.\" This decision is founded upon the proposition that \nno act of the Philippine Legislature can take from Courts of First Instance the \njurisdiction which they had at the time the Act of July 1, 1902, was passed by \nthe Congress of the United States; and Acts Nos. 2041 and 2131, in so far as \nthey attempt to take from the Court of First Instance the jurisdiction which it \nhad at that time, are void and of no effect.<\/p>\n<p>The question presented in the case before us is quite different. The \nconferring upon the justice of the peace of the power specified in the Act does \nnot deprive the Court of First Instance of any of its jurisdiction. Act No. \n2041, in effect, authorizes the temporary appointment of the justice of the \npeace as judge of the Court of First Instance, to remain such until the case to \nwhich he has been duly assigned has been finally determined. By that Act the \nnumber of judges in the Court of First Instance in a given province is \ntemporarily increased from one to two. The justice of the peace acts as a judge \nof the Court of First Instance and his acts have the same force and effect as \nthe acts of the regular judge. Holding a Court of First Instance does not \ndeprive that court of any of its powers. He exercises them for it.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment finally dismissing the action is affirmed, with costs against \nthe appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

This js an appeal from the \norder denying the application.<\/p>\n<p>Some time before the proceeding in question was instituted Joaquin Lorenzo Uy \nYjo, by bribing Fred C. Bruhez, at that time a customs inspector, by delivering \nto him P3,500, consisting of seven P500 bills, obtained the importation of a \nconsiderable quantity of opium into the Philippine Islands. The bribery and the \nconsequent importation were discovered and both parties were arrested charged \nwith the illegal importation of opium. The P3,500 was found in the possession of \nBruhez, was seized by the customs officials and was presented in the Court of \nFirst Instance as evidence upon the trial of Joaquin Lorenzo Uy Yjo. He was duly \nconvicted and sentenced, but the money was still left in the hands of the court \nto be used as evidence upon the trial of the other accused, Fred C. Bruhez. He, \nhowever, eluded detention, escaped from the Philippine Islands and has never \nbeen brought to trial. The information filed against him was later dismissed on \nthe application of the prosecuting attorney.<\/p>\n<p>It was at this point that the present application was made for the recovery \nof the P3,500. Such application, however, was not made by Joaquin Lorenzo Uy \nYjo, who delivered the money to the customs official, but by one Ignacio \nVelasco, who asserts that Joaquin Lorenzo Uy Yjo, at the time of the illegal \nimportation complained of, was in his employ as a trusted and confidential \nservant and that, during the absence of Velasco from Manila, and without his \nknowledge or consent, Joaquin Lorenzo Uy Yjo drew a check upon Velasco's bank \naccount for the sum of P3,500, by means of which there was turned over to said \nJoaquin Lorenzo Uy Yjo by the bank seven P500 bills; that said bills belonged to \nVelasco and the identical bills involved in this application were used in \nbribing Fred C. Bruhez to permit the illegal importation of opium. He asserts \nthat that identical money belongs to him, and that he himself not having been \niif anw wise engaged in the commission of the crime, and being wholly ignorant \nof the fact of its commission, he is entitled to recover possession of the money \nfrom the Court of First Instance under the provisions of article 62 of the Penal \nCode.<\/p>\n<p>This petition was denied by the court and application was made for a new \ntrial. A new trial was granted and a rehearing of the whole matter had. Upon \nthat hearing testimony was presented by Velasco for the purpose of demonstrating \nhis ownership of the P3,500 in question. On the termination of the hearing the \ncourt denied the petition and refused to deliver the money to Velasco but, \ninstead, stated its determination to turn it over to the Collector of Customs \nfor confiscation. The court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I am of the opinion that my refusal to deliver it to the Insular Collector \nof Customs after the complaint against Bruhez had been dismissed, because it \nshould be confiscated, was erroneous.<br\/><br\/>\"I am of opinion that the court has \nno authority to confiscate this money which came in the possession of the court \nin the way in which this did. It was not money used, or a part of the means used \nto procure an unlawful importation into the Philippine Islands. It having come \nin the hands of the Insular Collector of Customs in the transaction of the \nbusiness of the Customs Bureau it belongs to that Bureau, and this court has no \njurisdiction to determine in this action that it be delivered to the \npetitioner.<\/p>\n<p>\"Counsel for the petitioner insist that, the issues having been submitted to \nthis court in relation to the ownership of the money, that the court has \njurisdiction to dispose of it but I am unable to reach such \nconclusion.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>While the proceedings to determine to whom the P3,500 should be delivered \nwere pending, it appears that there was also before the Insular Collector of \nCustoms a proceeding relative to the same subject matter. Certain customs \nofficials having seized the money, the Insular Collector of Customs sent to Fred \nC. Bruhez the following notice:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"You are hereby informed that P3,500 Philippine currency, used by you in \nattempting to bribe a customs officer, has this day been seized for violation of \nsection 333, of Act No. 355.<\/p>\n<p>\"A hearing will be held at this customhouse at 10 o'clock a. m., Monday \nmorning, December 11, 1911. If you desire to make claim for same, you should be \npresent at that time in person or by attorney, with whatever relevant evidence \nyou may care to offer.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Nothing was ever done in this proceeding further than the giving of the \nnotice referred to and, so far as the record shows, it is still pending. It is \nour opinion that the court below should have resolved all of the questions \npresented by the issues, among them being the ownership of the P3,500. If that \nmoney was owned by Joaquin Lorenzo Uy Yjo and was by him used to bribe a customs \nofficial to permit the illegal importation of opium, it became an instrument \nused in the commission of that crime and would be susceptible to the \ndispositions provided for in articles 25 and 62 of the Penal Code. Article 25 \nprovides, among other things, that, as an accessory penalty, there shall be \"a \nforfeiture of the instruments and proceeds of the offense\" and article 62 \nprovides that \"every penalty imposed for the commission of a felony shall carry \nwith it the forfeiture of the proceeds of the crime and the instrument with \nwhich it was committed. ' Such proceeds and instruments shall be forfeited \nunless they be the property of a third person not liable for the offense.\"<\/p>\n<p>These articles constitute the law which governs the disposition of the money \nin question. If Joaquin Lorenzo Uy Yjo had been convicted of the crime of \nbribery, then the money paid as a bribe would have been forfeited by virtue of \narticle 389. The crime charged and prosecuted, how ever, being that of illegal \nimportation of opium, the money became an instrument used in the commission of \nthe crime and, therefore, became subject to the articles of the Penal Code \nalready referred to.<\/p>\n<p>Under these articles of the Penal Code the court trying the cause has \njurisdiction to determine the ownership and disposition of the instrument used \nin the commission of the crime, and any person claiming this instrument has a \nright to take his proceeding in that court for the purpose of determining his \nrights in the premises.<\/p>\n<p>We have been cited ,to no statute or other authority which gives the Insular \nCollector of Customs any jurisdiction whatever over the money involved in this \nlitigation.<\/p>\n<p>To be sure, it was used in corrupting one of the officials of that bureau, \nbut it is not subject to seizure and confiscation by the Insular Collector of \nCustoms for that reason. So far as we have been able to ascertain from the \nmeager citations and references presented on Ihis hearing, the right to seize \nproperty and declare it forfeited by the Insular Collector of Customs is \nrestricted to merchandise which is imported or which it is attempted to import \nillegally and does not extend to the money which may be used as a bribe to \ncorrupt the officials of that bureau.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the court below is hereby set aside and vacated and the cause \nreturned to the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, with instructions \nto determine the questions presented by the issues framed with respect to the \nsum of P3,500 which is the subject matter of the action.<\/p>\n<p>This court expresses no opinion as to whom the said sum belongs. That is a \nmatter, which is left to the judgment of the trial court from the evidence \npresented to it.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Moir, judge, \ndismissed the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiffs.\n<p>On September 1, 1906, Macario Samson filed in the Court of First Instance of \nAlbay a suit for recovery of possession of a tract of land located in Mabaryu, \nof the municipality of Polangui, Albay, from the married couple, Vicenta \nSalvilla and Pascual Sierra, who held it by usurpation. After due trial, the \ncourt absolved the defendants, declaring that the plaintiff is not the owner of \nthe land claimed in the complaint, wherein it was also prayed that said \ndefendants be sentenced to pay the plaintiff P1,000 as damages.<\/p>\n<p>A bill of exceptions was brought into this court by virtue of an appeal \nraised by the plaintiff Samson from the judgment of the court below, and such \nappeal having been found to be proper, the court, under date of January 16, \n1909, reversed the judgment appealed from and declared that ownership and \npossession of the land claimed pertained to the plaintiff. Defendants were \nsentenced to deliver and restore possession of the same to the plaintiff, but \nthey were absolved from the claim for damages, as neither the existence nor the \namount thereof had been proven (Samson <em>vs.<\/em> Salvilla and Sierra, 12 \nPhil. Rep., 497).<\/p>\n<p>At this point, as in the meanwhile the said Macario Samson had died, counsel \nfor his widow Juliana Solano and their children and only heirs, Domingo Samson \nand Felisa Samson, filed suit on October 24, 1912, to recover rents from the \nsaid Vicenta Salvilla and Pascual Sierra. He alleged that, by virtue of the \ndecision rendered by the Supreme Court, the sheriff of the Province of Albay \nhad, on March 10,1909, carried out its mandates by placing the predecessor in \ninterest of the plaintiffs in possession of the land in litigation, which the \ndefendants had held by usurpation from June, 1906, to March 10, 1909. They had \ntilled it and enjoyed the products thereof but had failed to deliver to the \nowner of the land, the predecessor in interest of the plaintiffs, the third of \nthe crops that belonged to the latter in the years 1907, 1908, and 1909. This \nthird was the rent of the said land, of which they were only tenants on shares, \nand consisted of 51 trojes and 35 manojos of paddy, -as harvested each year, \nequivalent to 103 cavanes and 10 gantas, worth P413.60 a year. The value of the \nthree crops for the years 1907, 1908, and 1909 amounts to the total sum of \nP1,240.80, which was not paid to the deceased Macario Samson in his lifetime, \nnor to his heirs the plaintiffs, although the defendants knew that they were \nobligated to deliver to the owner of the land a third of its products in those \nthree years, or the value thereof. They refused to make delivery of the same and \nappropriated the third to their own use, wherefore counsel for the plaintiffs \nasked for judgment ordering the defendants to deliver to the plaintiffs 310 \ncavanes and 5 gantas of paddy, or the value thereof, P1,240.80, together with \nthe interest on this amount, and to pay the costs of the case;<\/p>\n<p>The demurrer filed to the foregoing complaint by counsel for the defendants \nwas overruled on the ground that the plea of <em>res adjudicata<\/em> cannot be \nset up in a demurrer, but must be alleged as a special defense in answer and \nmust be afterwards proven as such. In answer to the complaint, counsel for the \ndefendants then denied each and all of the allegations contained therein and not \nexpressly admitted in the answer, but he admitted the allegations set forth in \nparagraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the complaint and the documents forming a \npart thereof, marked \"A\" and \"B\". He especially denied the allegations in \nparagraphs 7 and 8 thereof.<\/p>\n<p>In special defense he alleged that the subject-matter of this litigation is \n<em>res adjudicata<\/em> in the civil case No. 636 of the Court of Albay and No. \n4461 of the general docket of the Supreme Court, as appears in the said Exhibits \nA and B, and he therefore prayed the court to absolve the defendants from the \ncomplaint and to sentence the plaintiffs to pay the costs and forever hold their \npeace.<\/p>\n<p>As a result the court rendered the decision that has been mentioned, \nwhereupon counsel for the plaintiffs excepted thereto and appealed by filing the \ncorresponding bill of exceptions.<\/p>\n<p>The question arising in this suit is whether the claim for rent, or price of \nleasing the land usurped, which was ordered restored in the said judgment, \nconsisting of the third of the products of the said land at the rate of 103 \ncavanes and 10 gantas of paddy for each of the three years 1907, 1908 and 1909, \nor the value thereof, P1,240.80, is involved and included in the complaint filed \nin the previous suit and the final judgment rendered therein, and therefore \nwhether it has already been finally decided.<\/p>\n<p>In the complaint filed in the previous suit the plaintiff Macario Samson \nasked that the defendants be sentenced to pay him the sum of Pl ,000 as damages, \nand in reversing the judgment appealed from this Court declared that the \nplaintiff Samson was not entitled to such damages as he had not proved the \nexistence or the amount thereof.<\/p>\n<p>In the present suit the widow and heirs of Macario Samson pray that the \ndefendants be directed to pay them a third of the paddy crop they harvested from \nthe land usurped during those three years, which in all amounts to 310 cavanes \nand 5 gantas, the value whereof is P1,240.80, alleging that the defendants \nfailed to deliver said third of the products as rent or price of the lease \nstipulated, after presentation in September of 1906 of the complaint in said \nprevious suit, up to March, 1909, when possession of the land in question was \nrestored to the plaintiff. This claim for rent for these three years cannot be \nregarded as included in the previous suit for recovery, wherein among other \nthings payment was demanded from the defendants of the sum of P1,000 as damages, \nfor these damages referred to injury done before the filing of the complaint, in \nwhich no claim was set up with reference to later damages.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the defendants alleges that the plaintiff, in fixing the sum of \nP1,000 as the amount of damages caused him, did not specify that they were \nincurred only up to the date of the complaint and he asked for payment thereof \nwithout any distinction and without reservation of his right to claim damages \nsubsequent to the filing of the complaint, since indemnity for damages, although \nit might have two sources, ought to be the subject matter of a single action, \nwhich cannot be divided merely on account of time. The right of the owner of the \ntract to be indemnified arose and could be enforced from the moment when the \noccupation of the property became illegal on the part of the defendants until \nthe time when the owner should be restored to possession, the action being \nsingle for the reason that the cause thereof, the illegal occupation of the \nproperty, is single.<\/p>\n<p>In order that a final and executory judgment justify the plea of <em>res \nadjudicata<\/em> in another suit subsequently instituted, and that such plea be \nadmissible, it is indispensable that there exist in both actions identity of \npersons, things and rights of action requisites that must concur in common \nbetween the first suit already carried to judgment and the one subsequently \ninstituted, by showing that in this second suit the complaint is based upon the \nsame thing that was the subject matter of the previous litigation, that the same \nground was alleged and that it was between the same parties. (Bowler \n<em>vs.<\/em> Estate of Alvarez, 23 Phil. Rep., 561.)<\/p>\n<p>Every question determined by final judgment in a trial before the courts is \nconsidered <em>res adjudicata.<\/em> (Civil Code, art. 1252; Code of Civil \nProcedure, sees. 306, 307.) <\/p>\n<p>Identity of the parties litigant does really exist between the previous suit \nfinally determined by the decision, Exhibit B, and the present one, for the \ndefendants in this suit are the same persons who were sentenced in the preceding \none to restore possession of the land they held by usurpation, and as Macario \nSamson, the plaintiff in that suit, had died, the claimants in the present \naction are his widow and children, his legal successors in interest to his \nrights to the land in question and to the damages the usurpers of the tract \ncaused him.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise identical is the right of action arising from the right to claim \nindemnity for damages caused by said usurpation of the land belonging to the \nplaintiff in the first suit, Macario Samson, to whose rights his heirs, now the \nplaintiffs, have succeeded through his death, since the same ground for seeking \nindemnity for said damages has been alleged in both actions.<\/p>\n<p>But a like identity does not exist in the subject matter of the two suits, \nfor in the previous one claim was made upon the defendants for payment of the \nsum of P1,000 as damages caused to the plaintiff from the date of the usurpation \nuntil that of the complaint, September 1, 1906, by the illegal occupation of the \nland which is the subject matter of the action for recovery of possession; and \nin the present suit it is prayed that the same defendants be sentenced to \ndeliver the third of the crops harvested by them from the land they usurped \nduring the years 1907, 1908, and 1909, as rent for the tract, which third part \nof the crops amounts to 103 cavanes and 10 gantas of paddy a year, worth \nannually P413.60 and for the three years P1,240.80. The defendants kept that \nthird of the products of the land detained during the three years subsequent to \nthe action for recovery until the land recovered was, in compliance with the \njudgment of execution, restored to its owner, the predecessor in interest of the \nherein plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>Accordingly, with respect to damages, the things that were the subject matter \nof the complaint in the first action and those of the claim herein are not the \nsame nor are they identical. In the former action indemnity was sought for \ndamages caused to the plaintiff from the commencement of the usurpation until \nthe date of the complaint, and in the present one payment is demanded of the \namount of the rent of the land detained, consisting of the third of the crops \ngrown during the three years following the complaint, until the land was \nreturned to its owner or the value of each of the said crops of paddy was \npaid.<\/p>\n<p>On the supposition therefore, that the subject matter in each case is \ndifferent, the first being with reference to damages, it is evident that there \nis a lack of one of the requisites indispensable to make the result of the first \nsuit, as shown by the final judgment, Exhibit B, res adjudicata, in the present \none, and consequently the absolution of the defendants from the complaint for \ndamages, calculated by the plaintiffs at P1,000, is not <em>res adjudicata<\/em> \nin the present case. Their prayer that the defendants be sentenced to deliver to \nthe plaintiffs 310 cavanes and 5 gantas of paddy, or the value thereof, \nP1,240.80, was not made or decided in the previous suit, so it cannot be \nunderstood to have been duly included in the judgment therein rendered, Exhibit \nB.<\/p>\n<p>This being the case, and as it has been shown in this decision that the \nplaintiffs, successors in interest of Macario Samson, are entitled to claim the \nsaid quantity of paddy, a third part of the crops of three years or the value \nthereof, from the defendants, whose plea that the claim was finally decided in \nthe previous action is inadmissible and as the parties have not introduced their \nrespective proofs to show whether or not such crops are owed as rent, trial of \nthe case should be proceeded with in first instance for that purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, the judgment appealed from is set aside, and the case will be \nreturned to the court from which it comes, with a certified copy of this \ndecision, so that the Court of First Instance may, in accordance with law, \ndirect the taking of such evidence as the parties may present in these \nproceedings. So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Moreland, Trent<\/em>, and <em>Araullo, \nJJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/div>",

The original information \nis as follows:\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Jose Baison is accused by the undersigned of a violation of paragraph 4, \nsection 30, of the Election Law, committed as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\"That the said Jose Baison, on or about the 4th day of June, 1912, at the \nmunicipality of Misamis, Province of Misamis, knowing that he was not entitled \nso to do, did then and there maliciously and unlawfully vote at the general \nelections for delegates to the Philippine Assembly, and provincial and municipal \nofficials, the said Jose Baison being then and there delinquent in the payment \nof land taxes in the amount of P56.88 for the years 1908, 1909, 1910, and 1911, \ncontrary to the statute in such cases made and provided.\u2014Misamis, Misamis, \nSeptember 29, 1913,\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The defendant was arraigned on September 29, 1913, at which time the court \nasked him the following question:<\/p>\n<p>JUDGE. You are accused of having violated paragraph 4 of section 30, of the \nElection Law, in that you did maliciously and intentionally vote in the general \nelection held on June 4, 1912, you being delinquent in the sum of P56.88 in the \npayment of your land taxes for the years 1908, 1909, 1910, and 1911. What do you \nsay to this charge? Do you plead guilty or not guilty?<\/p>\n<p>DEFENDANT. Guilty.<br\/><br\/>Upon recommendation of the fiscal the defendant was \nthen, on September 29th, sentenced to imprisonment for the period of one month \nand to the payment of the costs. On the 3d of October, 1913, the defendant was \ncalled into court and the following proceedings were had in his presence:<\/p>\n<p>FISCAL (addressing the court.) I ask permission of the court to amend the \ninformation presented in this case by changing the word \"Baison\" to \"Vayson\" and \nthe number \"4\" just after the word \"paragraph,\" substituting therefor number 1, \nso that the same will read \"Paragraph number 1.\"<\/p>\n<p>COURT. The motion is admitted.<\/p>\n<p>COURT (addressing the defendant). Are you the vice-president of the town of \nMisamis, Province of Misamis?<\/p>\n<p>DEFENDANT. Formerly, yes; but now, no. I presented my resignation in the \nmonth of May.<\/p>\n<p>COURT. Were you elected vice-president in 1912?<\/p>\n<p>DEFENDANT, Yes, sir;<\/p>\n<p>The court then revoked the sentence dated September 29,and imposed in lieu \nthereof a sentence of six months' imprisonment.<\/p>\n<p>The first sentence was imposed upon the recommendation for leniency made by \nthe fiscal on the ground that the defendant was one \"of a class of poor ignorant \npersons whose violations of the Election Law should not be punished too \nseverely, owing to their want of education,\" The proceedings had on the 3d of \nOctober developed that the defendant had been vice-president of his \nmunicipality, was a candidate for that office when he committed the offense for \nwhich he was charged, and had been delinquent in his taxes for four years. The \ncourt considered these facts sufficient to call for the imposition of a heavier \npenalty. Both sentences were within the discretion reposed in the trial court \nunder the first paragraph of section 30 of the Election Law, defining and \npenalizing the offense of which the defendant was guilty. In our opinion the \nimposition of six months' imprisonment is not excessive. This punishment is now \nquestioned on that ground.<\/p>\n<p>The information was amended, as above indicated, after the defendant had \nentered his plea, but the changes made were mere corrections of clerical errors \nand did not change the allegations concerning the commission of the crime. The \ndefendant was charged originally with a violation of paragraph 4 of section 30 \nof the Election Law, but the allegations which follow in the second paragraph of \nthe original information and the explanation given the defendant by the court \nshow that it was the first paragraph of section 30 which was violated and not \nthe fourth. The fourth paragraph penalizes the act of taking or subscribing to \nany false oath concerning any material fact in any registration or election \nproceedings, while the first paragraph penalizes any person who votes or \nattempts to vote, knowing that he is not entitled so to do. The result is that \nthe correction of the clerical errors in the complaint could not and did not \nprejudice the rights of the defendant.<\/p>\n<p>We will now inquire whether the court had the power under the facts and \ncircumstances above set forth to set aside its original judgment and impose the \npenalty of six months. In determining this question it must be borne in mind \nthat the defendant had served no part of the original sentence when the second \nsentence was pronounced.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Arnedo <em>vs.<\/em> Llorente (18 Phil. Rep., 257), this Court \nsaid: \"When not otherwise provided by statute, all courts in the Islands have \nplenary control over the proceedings had before them, as also of judgments \ntherein, until such judgments become final in the sense that the party in whose \nfavor they are rendered is entitled as of right, to have execution thereon, and, \nin the exercise of a sound discretion, the courts may take such action touching \nthe vacation and amendment of these judgments as truth and justice may \nrequire.\"<\/p>\n<p>This doctrine, as to civil cases, has recently been affirmed in De Fiesta \n<em>vs.<\/em> Llorente (25 Phil. Rep., 554); and Broce vs. Apurado (26 Phil. \nRep., 581). Does it apply to criminal cases? In United States <em>vs.<\/em> \nCrossfield (24 Phil. Rep., 321), this court held that the Court of First \nInstance had no power to modify its judgment in a criminal case after the \nexpiration of the period for appeal. This case negatively admits the proposition \nthat a Court of First Instance would have the power to modify its judgment in a \ncriminal case before it became final, that is, before the expiration of the time \nallowed for an appeal, is it true that the accused may not object to such action \non the part of the court when the proposed change is not desired by him? Upon \nthis precise question, we are not aware of any precedents in this jurisdiction. \nThe case of <em>Ex parte<\/em> Lange (85 U. S., 163, 21 L. ed., 872), states the \ngeneral rule as follows: \"The general power of the court over its own judgments, \norders and decrees, in both civil and criminal cases, during the existence of \nthe term to which they are first made, is undeniable.\"<\/p>\n<p>That case, however, must be considered as an exception to the general rule \nthus announced. Whereas, the statute provided for imprisonment or a fine, the \ncourt had imposed imprisonment <em>and<\/em> a fine. The prisoner had paid the \nlatter and had served five days of the prison sentence, when the court, during \nthe same term, called him to the bar and amended its judgment so that it called \nfor imprisonment only. The Supreme Court held that the payment of the fine was \nan authorized punishment for the crime and that the revision of the sentence was \nin effect subjecting the prisoner to a second punishment, which was contrary to \nthe jeopardy clause of the Constitution. This exception to the general rule has \nbeen recognized in a number of cases, the majority of which are referred to in \nthe Notes of United States Reports, vol, 8, p. 159. But it is apparent that, as \nthe present defendant had served no part of the original sentence, he cannot \nbring himself within the exception.<\/p>\n<p>In Bradford <em>vs.<\/em> People (22 Colo., 157), judgment calling for \nimprisonment for one year was pronounced on January 28. On January 31, the \ncourt, on its own motion, set aside this judgment and entered another, \nsentencing the defendant to imprisonment for one year on each of three counts. \nAs it was specifically provided, however, that all of these sentences should run \nconcurrently, the aggregate of the sentences in the revised judgment was the \nsame as the first.<\/p>\n<p>The court said: \"In cases where the defendant has entered upon the execution \nof a valid sentence, it is well established that such sentence cannot be set \naside and a new sentence entered. The sentence in this case was for the full \nterm of one year in the state penitentiary, and his incarceration in the county \njail of Arapahoe county, temporarily or otherwise could not be credited upon his \nterm; it was simply a means<br\/>to an end, in order that the defendant might not \nescape until he could be safely conveyed to and lodged in the state \npenitentiary. It was no part of his sentence under the statute, and the time so \nspent could not be deducted from his term, as it is provided that the term shall \nbe computed from and including the day on which he is received into the \npenitentiary.\"<\/p>\n<p>In Tillman <em>vs.<\/em> State (58 Pla., 113), it was said that \"during the \nsame term of court at which the sentence is imposed, before the defendant had \nbegun serving such sentence, the trial judge has the power to modify such \nsentence.\"<\/p>\n<p>In State <em>vs<\/em>. Dougherty (70 Iowa, 489), judgment was entered against \nthe defendant on his plea of guilty for a fine and costs. At the same term and \nbefore any part of the judgment had been complied with, the court set the \njudgment aside and entered another judgment, which imposed a greater fine.<\/p>\n<p>The appellate court said: \"The question in the case is whether the court, \nafter it had entered a judgment in regular form against the defendant, had the \npower, at the same term and before any part of the judgment had been performed, \nto set that judgment aside, and enter another judgment against him imposing a \nheavier penalty. The power of the courts to revise, correct and change their \nsentences, at the term at which they are pronounced, and before anything has \nbeen done under them, has long been recognized both in this country and in \nEngland; and the cases are numerous in which the power has been exercised. (See \nCom. <em>vs.<\/em> Weymouth, 2 Allen, 144; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Harmison, 3 Sawy., \n556; Memphis <em>vs.<\/em> Brown, 94 U. S., 715; Ex parte Sawyer, 21 Wall., 235; \nBurnside <em>vs.<\/em> Ennis, 43 Ind., 411; Regina <em>vs.<\/em> Fitz gerald, 1 \nSalk., 401; Rex <em>vs.<\/em> Price, 6 East, 323; Rex \n<em>vs.<\/em><br\/>Leicestershire Justices, 1 Maule &amp; S., 442.)\"<\/p>\n<p>In State <em>vs.<\/em> Hughes (35 Kan., 626), the defendant was sentenced to \nimprisonment at hard labor in the penitentiary for six months. Within an hour \nafter sentence was pronounced, the attention of the court was called to the fact \nthat no person could be sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor in the state \nprison for less than one year. The court thereupon proceeded to sentence the \nprisoner to imprisonment for a term of one year.<\/p>\n<p>The supreme court said: \"The sentence first pronounced against the defendant \nwas not executed or put into operation and 'so long as it remained unexecuted, \nit was, in contemplation of law, in the breast of the court, and subject to \nrevision and alteration.' (Com. vs. Weymouth, 2 Allen, 147.) We think it was \nclearly within the discretion and power of the court until the end of the term, \nto amend and revise or increase the sentence which had not gone into effect. (1 \nBish. on Gr. Proc., sec. 1298, and cases cited.) As nothing had been done under \nthe sentence first pronounced, and as the final sentence did not impose a \npenalty in excess of that provided by law, the rights of the defendant were not \ninfringed upon, nor has he any ground for complaint\"<\/p>\n<p>In Commonwealth vs. Weymouth (2 Allen, Mass., 144; 79 Am. Dec, 776), the \ndefendant was first sentenced to two years' imprisonment in a house of \ncorrection. On the next day, the prosecuting attorney moved for a revision of \nthe sentence and, over the prisoner's protest, additional testimony was heard, \nafter which the original judgment was revised and the defendant sentenced to \nimprisonment in the state prison for three and one-half years, the first two \ndays of which were to be solitary. After citing authorities, the court held the \nrule to be that if no action has been taken, there is no good reason for \nrefusing to vacate the judgment for sufficient cause and substituting a new one \nin its place.<\/p>\n<p>The court said: \"The petitioner in the present case is not subjected by the \namended sentence of the court to any punishment for his offense other or greater \nthan that allowed by law. He was never taken or charged on the warrant which was \nissued on the sentence as originally pronounced. That sentence never went into \noperation, and in effect, was the same as if it had never been passed. So long \nas it remained unexecuted, it was, in contemplation of law, in the breast of the \ncourt, and subject to revision and alteration. He was not injured or put in \njeopardy by it any further than he would have been by a conclusion or judgment \nof the court as to the extent of his punishment, which had not been announced. \nUntil something was done to carry the sentence into execution, by subjecting the \nprisoner to the warrant in the hands of the officer, no right or privilege to \nwhich he was entitled was taken away or invaded by revoking the sentence first \npronounced and substituting in its stead the one under which he now stands \ncharged. If it had appeared that the petitioner had actually been taken and \ncommitted under the first sentence, or if he had been thereby condemned to \nimprisonment in the state prison, so that the term of his sentence would be \ncomputed from the time he was first ordered to remain in the custody of the \nsheriff, according to the statutes of 1859, chapter 248, we might have arrived \nat a different result; but on the record as it stands, we are all of opinion \nthat the order must be, Prisoner remanded.\"<\/p>\n<p>In Lee <em>vs.<\/em> State (32 Ohio, 113), the defendant pleaded guilty to a \ncharge of illegally selling intoxicating liquor and was sentenced to pay a fine \nand costs of the cause. These proceedings were had on May 12, 1874, but no steps \nwere taken to carry the sentence into execution. On the 15th of the same month, \nthe defendant was again before the court, this time on a charge of selling \nliquor to a minor, and the court then finding that in passing the said sentence \nit had acted under a misapprehension of the facts of the case, and that no \nportion of said fine and costs had been paid or secured, and that the defendant \nhad not, been taken into custody under said judgment, set aside the same, and \nproceeded, over the defendant's objection, to sentence him to a heavier \nfine.<br\/><br\/>The court said: \"The single question is, had the court the power to \nrevise and increase its judgment, at the same term before any part of the fine \nand costs had been paid, and before any steps had been taken to execute it?<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That this power exists, is settled by a long line of decisions of the \nhighest authority. * * *<\/p>\n<p>\"It appears from the record, that in passing the first sentence, the court \nacted under a misapprehension of the facts.<\/p>\n<p>\"In the absence of a showing to the contrary, we must presume that there were \nsufficient reasons addressing themselves to the sound judicial discretion of the \ncourt for such action, and that it was deemed to be necessary in furtherance of \njustice and the due administration of the law. It is said this is a dangerous \npower. The same may be said of the exercise of all judicial discretion. This is \nequally as true of the discretion exercised in the first instance, in fixing the \nsentence, as in that exercised in revising it.<\/p>\n<p>\"If the court in revising its own sentence confines itself to such \ninformation as it has the right to have in the first instance, no greater danger \nof abuse exists than in the exercise of judicial discretion in rendering its \nfirst judgment.<\/p>\n<p>\"The power to revise judgments of the same term, and, before execution has \ncommenced, to correct errors and mistakes is necessary for the protection of the \ndefendant, as well as the public, and may be exercised as well in his favor as \nagainst him, when the court has been misled by mistake or \nfraud.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In Nichols<em> vs.<\/em> United States (106 Fed., 672), the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the Eighth District had under consideration the act of a district \njudge under the following circumstances: After verdict and before rendering \nsentence, the judge called the attorney for the defendant to the bar and asked \nif it was the intention to prosecute the matter any further, and, understanding \nthat it was not, the court stated that he would enter a fine of $100 against the \ndefendant and imprisonment for six months. Thereupon counsel said that he \nintended to prosecute an appeal, and the court called up the defendant, who was \nstill within the bar, and directed the clerk to enter a fine of $100 and \nimprisonment for twelve months.<\/p>\n<p>The Circuit Court said: \"The extent of the punishment to be inflicted on the \ndefendant, within the limit prescribed by the statute for the offense, rested in \nthe sound judicial discretion of the court. The imposition of the first sentence \ndid not put an end to the exercise of this discretion. The first sentence was \nnot recorded. The defendant had not yet left the bar, and had not satisfied or \nsuffered any part of the punishment thereunder, when it was set aside and the \nsecond sentence imposed. Under these conditions, it was competent. for the court \nto reconsider its sentence and impose a different one. (Ex parte Lange, 18 \nWall., 163; 21 L. ed., 872.) The bill of exceptions does not show that the first \nsentence was set aside, and the second imposed, doubling the period of \nimprisonment, because the defendant had declared his intention of appealing the \ncase. A new sentence, with enhanced punishment, based upon such a reason, would \nbe a flagrant violation of the rights of the defendant. It would be the \ninfliction of a penalty for the exercise of a clear legal right, and would call \nfor the severest censure. But no such motive can be imputed to the court below. \nThis court is bound to presume that the lower court, in recalling its first and \nimposing a second and more severe sentence, did so from right and proper \nmotives, and for the purpose of imposing a punishment which, upon reflection, it \ndeemed better suited to the offense.\"<\/p>\n<p>In England the authorities are the same way. In King <em>vs.<\/em> Price (6 \nEast, 323; 102 Eng. Rep., 1310), the defendant was convicted of illegally voting \nat an election and was sentenced to one month's imprisonment in Newgate and to \nbe then transported beyond the seas for seven years. At the same term and upon \nfurther consideration of the law governing the case, the court proceeded to \nimpose a more severe sentence.<\/p>\n<p>The recently compiled encyclopedia, entitled the Laws of England (vol. 9, p. \n377), affirms the rule as follows: \"The court may at any time during the same \nassizes or sessions, before the judgment has been entered on the record, vacate \nthe judgment passed and substitute another.\"<\/p>\n<p>American textwriters are also in full accord with the doctrine under \ndiscussion. Black on Judgments, section 153 (citing State <em>vs.<\/em> \nDougherty, 70 Iowa, 439, supra), says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is even held that the court, in a criminal action, may set aside a \njudgment made in regular course, imposing on the defendant a fine and the costs \nof the proceedings, during the same term at which the judgment was rendered, and \nbefore any part of it has been performed, and may impose a greater fine than was \nimposed by the first judgment.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In 12 Cyc, 783, it is said: \"At any time during the term the court has the \npower to reconsider the judgment, and to revise and correct it by mitigating and \neven by increasing its severity, where the original sentence has not been \nexecuted or put into operation; but where the prisoner has paid his fine or his \nimprisonment has begun, the court has no power to recall him to revoke his \nformer sentence and impose one which inflicts a greater punishment.\"<\/p>\n<p>And in 1 Bishop's New Crim. Procedure, sec. 1298, it is said: \"The power of \nthe court to alter its docket entries and records during the term wherein they \nare made includes the right within such time to revise, correct and change its \nsentences, however formally pronounced, if nothing has been done under them. But \nsteps taken under a sentence\u2014 for example, a substantial part execution \nthereof\u2014will cut off the right to alter it, even during the term, and with the \nexpiration of the term the power expires.\"<\/p>\n<p>As was said in the Arnedo case, the term system in vogue in the United States \nand England has no place in this country. The power of the courts in this \ncountry over their judgments expires when they become final. Between the entry \nof the judgment and the date it becomes final is a period allowed by law for \nappeal or vacation of the judgment entered. It is during this period of time and \nto the same extent as the courts of England and America, that our courts have \ncontrol over their judgments to modify and revise.<\/p>\n<p>The authorities we have reviewed above demonstrate that until a criminal \njudgment has become final and unless the defendant has complied in whole or in \npart with the penalty imposed, the court may revise its judgment by either \nincreasing or decreasing the penalty imposed, so long as it keeps within the \nlimits of the penalty provided by law. Such a modification of the sentence is \nwithin the sound discretion of the court, and unless a review of the evidence \nshows that such discretion has been abused, affords no basis for complaint on \nthe part of either the prosecution or the defendant.<\/p>\n<p>In the present case the revised judgment of the court relates that the \ndefendant \"has not yet begun to serve the sentence imposed upon him.\" The facts \ndeveloped upon the. second hearing show clearly that the court did not abuse its \ndiscretion in revising his sentence. There is therefore no reversible error in \nthe judgment appealed from and it is hereby affirmed, with costs against the \nappellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

This complaint was \npresented in the court of the justice of the peace of the municipality of San \nAntonio, Province of Zambales. Said justice of the peace conducted a preliminary \nexamination and found that there was sufficient proof to show that the \ndefendants were probably guilty of the crime charged and held them to be tried \nbefore the Court of First Instance of said province.\n<p>On the 17th day of March, 1913, the prosecuting attorney of the Province of \nZambales presented a complaint in the Court of First Instance charging the said \ndefendants with the Crime of assassination, alleged to have been committed as \nfollows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"On or about January 13 in the place called Nagsasa, municipality of San \nAntonio, Province of Zambales, Philippine Islands, the said accused did \nwillfully, unlawfully, and criminally, with treachery and premeditation, on that \nsame night, kill and murder Robert A.

A deed done in violation of the law.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Upon the foregoing complaint the defendants were brought to trial. Before the \ncommencement of the trial the prosecuting attorney presented a motion asking \nthat the complaint against the defendant Pedro de Leon be dismissed and that he \nbe discharged from the custody of the law, for the reason that the proof was \ninsufficient to support the charges against him. Said motion of the fiscal was \ngranted, with one-half the costs <em>de officio,<\/em> and the defendant Pedro de \nLeon was discharged from the custody of the law.<\/p>\n<p><br\/>The other defendant, Enrique de Leon, was duly arraigned, tried, and \nfound guilty of the crime of assassination, with the qualifying circumstance of \n<em>alevosia<\/em> and the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity, and was \nsentenced to suffer the penalty of death; to indemnify the heirs of the \ndeceased, Robert A. Kubillus, in the sum of P1,000; and to pay one-half the \ncosts. From that sentence the defendant appealed to this court.<\/p>\n<p>From an examination of the record brought to this court it appears that the \nsaid Robert A. Kubillus was a surveyor; that he was a married man; that his \nwife's name was Felisa Banal; that for some time prior to the 13th day of \nJanuary, 1913, he had been living with his wife in the city of Manila; that \nabout one week before the said 13th day of January, 1918, he, together with the \ndefendant, Enrique de Leon, and his son, Pedro de Leon, went to the Province of \nZambales; that the deceased, Robert A. Kubillus, went to the Province of \nZambales for the purpose of doing some surveying; that the defendant, Enrique de \nLeon, and his son accompanied him for the purpose of rendering some assistance \n(the record does not disclose whether they went as servants or otherwise); that \nvery soon after they had arrived in the Province of Zambales, at the \n<em>sitio<\/em> of Nagsasa, in the Province of Zambales, on or about the 13th day \nof January, 1913, in the nighttime, the house or shack in which the said Robert \nA. Kubillus, with the defendant and the defendant's son, had been living was \nburned and that within a few days thereafter the charred remains of a human \nbeing were found in the ashes of said house; that within a few days thereafter \n(after the 13th of January, 1913) the defendant and his son appeared in the city \nof Manila; that the said Felisa Banal met them on .a street in the city of \nManila and they all went together to the house of the defendant; that while they \nwere in the house of the defendant, the latter made a confession to the said \nFelisa Banal, telling her that her husband, Robert A. Kubillus, was dead, and \ndescribed the manner in which he had been killed, showing to the said Felisa \nBanal a knife and a gold watch which she.recognized as the property of her \nhusband, and saying that the surveying instruments and other effects of her \nhusband had been buried in the sand near the place where her husband had been \nkilled; that the said Felisa Banal, even though the defendant had threatened her \nwith death if she should disclose what he had confessed to her, reported the \nconfession to the police of the city of Manila and to the Constabulary \nauthorities; that an investigation was at once made, both by the police \nauthorities of the city of Manila and the Constabulary authorities; that the \ndefendant could not be found in the city of Manila; that an order was sent to a \ncaptain of Constabulary, E. R. Nicholson, who was then in the Province of \nZambales, for the purpose of having an investigation made in and about the \n<em>sitio<\/em> of Nagsasa, for the purpose of discovering the body of said \nRobert A. Kubillus; that Captain Nicholson made an investigation and found a \nplace where a house had been burned and the charred remains of a human body in \nthe ashes; that a further investigation was made and a trunk, a \n<em>tampipi,<\/em> a suitcase, a tripod, a transit, shoes, and other effects were \nfound; that said effects were later proved to be the property of the said Robert \nA. Kubillus; that the burned house and the said hidden effects were in a very \nisolated place; that the Constabulary authorities continued to look for the \ndefendant and later found him in the Province of Tarlac at the <em>sitio <\/em>or \nbarrio of Buso; that the defendant was arrested and identified; that there was \nfound upon his person a cedula, which he said belonged to him, in which he had \ngiven his name as Cornelio Vinuya; that the defendant was questioned as to why \nhe had a cedula under the name of Cornelio Vinuya; that he said it was a mistake \non the part of the authorities who issued the said cedula; that he admitted that \nhis\/name was not Cornelio Vinuya but Enrique de Leon; that later and while the \ndefendant was under arrest, and without any threats or intimidation, he \nvoluntarily and willingly confessed to the officer (Cornelio Viray) who made the \narrest, that he had killed the American Kubillus; that he had killed the said \nKubillus on account of his bad conduct; that Kubillus was a bad man; that he was \nmean and used to scold every day. <\/p>\n<p>The defendant was sworn in his own behalf as a witness. He admitted that he \nand his son accompanied the said Robert A. Kubillus to the Province of Zambales; \nthat Kubillus was dead; that the house in which Kubillus lived had been burned; \nthat on the night the house was burned, he, the defendant, and his son were out \nfishing; and that there were other persons in the house with Kubillus.<\/p>\n<p>In this court the appellant presents a brief and the only defense which he \nmakes is that the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause was not \nsufficient to show that he was guilty of the crime with which he was charged, \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the fact that he was seen in the city of Manila by Felisa \nBanal, in possession of a knife and a gold watch which belonged to the deceased \nKubillus, and which were taken by the deceased to the Province of Zambales, we \nhave his voluntary extrajudicial confession that he committed the crime at the \nplace and time and in the manner described in the complaint. His extrajudicial \nconfession was corroborated in three particulars\u2014a place was found where a house \nhad been burned in the <em>sitio<\/em> of Nagsasa, Province of Zambales; the \ncharred remains of a human being were found in the ashes of the burned house; a \ntrunk, <em>tampipi,<\/em> a suitcase, a tripod, a transit, shoes and other \neffects were found buried in the sand near the place where the house was burned, \nin accordance with the confession of the defendant. Courts are slow to accept \nextrajudicial confessions, when they are subsequently disputed, unless they are \ncorroborated by other testimony. Generally the question of the admissibility of \nextrajudicial confessions is necessarily addressed, in the first instance, to \nthe judge, and since such discretion must be controlled by all the attendant \ncircumstances, the courts have wisely foreborne to mark with absolute precision \nany rules limiting the admission or exclusion of such testimony. Their \nadmissibility must depend largely in each case upon the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding the same. (Hopt <em>vs.<\/em> Utah, 110 U. S., 574; Bram <em>vs.<\/em> \nU. S., 168 U. S., 532; Wilson <em>vs.<\/em> U. S., 162 U. S., 613.) <\/p>\n<p>In all cases, however, before such confessions are admissible, it must be \nshown that they were made freely and voluntarily, without compulsion or \ninducement or hope of reward of any sort. (Wilson <em>vs.<\/em> V. S., 162 U. S., \n613; Bram <em>vs.<\/em> U. S., 168 U. S., 532; Hardy <em>vs.<\/em> V. S., 186 U. \nS., 224.)<\/p>\n<p>One reason why the courts should be careful in accepting as evidence \nextrajudicial confessions, is that they are frequently made because the \ndefendant may be induced to make them through hope or fear or for a reward. In \norder to constitute a voluntary confession, it should have been freely and \nvoluntarily given, with no promise, inducement, encouragement, hope, favor, \nthreats, or violence. (Wilson <em>vs.<\/em> U. S., 162 U. S., 613.)<\/p>\n<p>Confessions which are obtained by coercion or threat, by creating a fear or \nby giving a promise of assistance or reward, will be subject to objection and \nrejection on the part of the court. (Bram <em>vs.<\/em> U.S., 168 U. S., 532; \nHardy <em>vs.<\/em> U. S., 186 U. S., 224.)<\/p>\n<p><br\/>After a full consideration of the record and of all the facts and \ncircumstances, we are convinced that the defendant is guilty of the crime \ncharged, and that the sentence of the lower court should be affirmed, with \ncosts.

I., being then and \nthere a public official, namely, justice of the peace of Floridablanca, \nPampanga, P. I., in abuse of his office and authority, voluntarily, illegally, \nintentionally, and criminally, making use of deceit, that is to say, pretending \nthat there had been presented to his court by Luisa Garcia a claim against Juan \nMontemayor for the sum of P12, took and received from said Juan Montemayor the \nsaid sum of P12 for delivery to Luisa Garcia, but said accused then and there \ndelivered to the said Luisa Garcia the sum of P6 only, which was the sum \nactually claimed by her, and appropriated then and there to his own use the said \nsum of P6, to the injury and detriment of the said Juan Montemayor, thereafter \ndenying having received said sum from him and refusing to return \nit.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On the 13th day of March, 1912, the accused appeared before the court for \ntrial. The cause was duly opened and the trial proceeded with, the Government \npresenting as witnesses Luisa Garcia, Juan Montemayor, Juan Manlulu, and \nGervasio Lalic. These witnesses having testified, the court came to the \nconclusion that it was without jurisdiction, dismissed the case and ordered the \nprosecuting attorney to present an information to the justice of the peace.<\/p>\n<p>On the 9th of August of the same year the prosecuting attorney, instead of \npresenting an information for estafa to the justice's court, as ordered, filed \nan information against said accused in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga \ncharging him with malversation of public funds. The information alleged:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That the said accused on one of the days of the month of October, 1911, in \nthe municipality of Floridablanca, Pampanga, P. I, voluntarily, illegally, and \ncriminally, being, as he was, a public official, namely, justice of the peace of \nthe aforesaid municipality of Floridablanca, and charged for that reason with \nthe care and custody of public funds, collected from Juan Montemayor the sum of \nP12 which, according to the representations of the accused, Luisa Garcia had \nclaimed before him as such justice of the peace was due her from said Juan \nMontemayor, obtaining and receiving thereby from the said Montemayor the said \nsum of P12 for delivery to the said Luisa Garcia; but the said accused delivered \nto said Luisa Garcia the sum of P6 only, which was, as a matter of fact, the \nonly sum claimed from the beginning, neglecting and refusing to deposit the \nremaining P6 in the municipal treasury and refusing to give an account of the \nsame, thereby embezzling the same and converting the same to his own use.\" \n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On the 5th of November, 1912, the accused, by his attorneys, demurred to \nthecomplaint on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute \nmalversation of public funds. This demurrer was overruled and the accused was \nordered to plead: On the 2d of April, 1913, the accused excepted to the order \noverruling the demurrer, pleaded not guilty and at the same time entered a plea \nof former jeopardy and one of autre fois acquit. The latter pleas were based \nupon the fact that he had been tried once for the crime of estafa upon precisely \nthe same facts alleged in the information in the present case and acquitted \nthereof.<\/p>\n<p>The cause went to trial and the accused was found guilty and sentenced to two \nmonths' imprisonment, to indemnify Juan Montemayor in the sum of P6, with \nsubsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs. The \njudgment also perpetually disqualified the accused from holding public office \nwithin the Philippine Islands.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment must be reversed.<\/p>\n<p>The acts alleged to have been committed by the first information constitute \nthe crime of estafa against the complaining witness. As a necessary result those \nalleged in the second information do not constitute the crime of malversation of \npublic funds. The money paid by the debtor to the accused and herein complained \nof was paid involuntarily and under false representations and pretense made by \nthe accused for the purpose. The accused represented to the complainant that he \nwas authorized and required to collect P6, the amount of the claim against him, \nand P6 damages.<\/p>\n<p>The debtor paid upon that representation and the accused received in \naccordance therewith. This representation was false. The creditor neither \nrequired nor authorized such a collection. Wherever false representations are \nknowingly and intentionally made and money obtained by virtue thereof which is \nsubsequently converted to the use pf the person making the false representations \nor of some person other than the one from whom it was obtained, a criminal \naction lies.<\/p>\n<p>The charge of malversation of public funds has no foundation. The funds were \nnot public funds. Section 790 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides what fees \nor sums a justice of the peace is authorized to collect in civil and criminal \nactions and the disposition which must be made thereof. It provides that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The following are the legal fees which a justice of the peace shall \ncollect:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p align=\"left\">* * * * * * *<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\"For each civil action, three pesos.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p align=\"left\">* * * * * * *<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\"For taking affidavit, fifty centavos.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p align=\"left\">* * * * * * *<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\"For writing and certifying depositions, including oath, per one hundred \nwords, or fractional part thereof, twenty centavos.<\/p>\n<p>\"For certified copies of any record, per one hundred words, or fractional \npart thereof, twenty centavos.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Section 73 of Act No. 136 provides: \"No justice of the peace, clerk, or \namanuensis thereof shall collect or receive any fee, except such as are \nprescribed in the fee bill embraced in the Code of Civil Procedure.\"<\/p>\n<p>Section 71 of Act No. 136, as amended, provides in part as follows: \"Except \nwhen the justice of the peace acts as judge of the Court of First Instance, all \nfines imposed by a justice of the peace in criminal prosecutions and all fees \ncharged in civil suits or for any other service and collected shall be paid \nwithout delay to the municipal treasurer, or in the city of Manila to the \nCollector of Internal Revenue, to whom on the first day of each month the \njustice shall present a detailed statement of the amounts thus collected by him \nsince his last previous report and of the amounts which the municipal treasurer \nshould pay f6r fees in criminal proceedings during the preceding month. His \naccount shall forthwith be audited by the municipal treasurer and president, or \nin Manila by the Insular Auditor, by examining the records of the justice of the \npeace and any other papers or persons deemed necessary, and all mutilated or \nspoiled receipts must be accounted for and turned in by said justice. But it \nshall not be necessary for the justice to prove the insolvency of parties who \nhave failed to pay costs taxed against them.\"<\/p>\n<p>It has not been contended that the P6 collected by the accused constitued in \nany sense any of the fees enumerated in the sections just quoted. No civil \naction was begun. No witnesses were sworn or oaths taken; no record was made and \nno expenses incurred. There arose no occasion for the collection of any of the \nfees specified in the Code of Civil Procedure. As a necessary result, no part of \nthe money collected was public money and the accused was under no duty to the \npublic in relation thereto.<\/p>\n<p>We are also of the opinion that the plea of former jeopardy was well founded \nand that the present action should be dismissed for that reason alone.<\/p>\n<p>The ground for the dismissal of the action for estafa after the prosecution \nhad presented its case was that the sum involved being only P6, the penalty \nimposed under subdivision 1 of article 534 would be <em>arresto mayor<\/em> in \nits minimum and medium degrees,\u2014that is, the maximum punishment<br\/>would not be \nmore than six months' imprisonment and P200 fine; that, this being true, the \ncase fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of justice courts and the Court of \nFirst Instance accordingly had no jurisdiction.<\/p>\n<p>In this reasoning the trial court overlooked the fact that in addition to the \npenalty imposed by article 534 of the Penal Code, article 399 of the same code \nprovides that under certain circumstances there shall be imposed, in addition to \narresto mayor, temporary special disqualification in its maximum degree to \nperpetual special disqualification. The latter is a penalty which justices of \nthe peace have no jurisdiction to Impose. (U. S. <em>`<\/em> Bernardo, 19 Phil. \nRep., 265.) As a necessary result the crime of estafa as charged in the \ninformation in the case before us is not one over which a justice of the peace \nhas jurisdiction. (U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Ang Suyco, 17 Phil. Rep., 92.) \nAccordingly, the action was one within the jurisdiction of the Court of First \nInstance and the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was erroneous.<\/p>\n<p>As will be seen from reading the informations above set out the two charges \nare made upon precisely the same facts. While in one case the fact that the \njustice of the peace was a public functionary is emphasized more than in the \nother and stress is laid in one information more that in the other upon his \nfailure to account for the sum he received, nevertheless, essentially the facts \nare the same. It is not a case where the acts complained of constitute two or \nmore separate and distinct offenses for which he can be separately tried.<\/p>\n<p>The accused having already been put in jeopardy for his acts under one \ncharge, cannot now be tried for the commission of the same acts under another \ncharge.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed and the appellant acquitted; costs \n<em>de officio.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Adenas de las alhajas mencionadas, estaban, \nguardadas en dicho cajon las alhajas del cu\u00f1ado de dicho Javier, que consistian \nen un collar de oro con 28 brillantes; una peineta de oro con 24 brillantes, y \nuna peineta de plata con 22 perlas; y las alhajas de su cu\u00f1ada consistian en un \npar de pendientes con 5 brillantes cada unoo; un anillo solitario de brillante, \ny otro anillo denominado bis a con 6 brillantes. Las alhajas del cu\u00f1ado de \nJavier valian P1, 130.00 y las de su cu\u00f1ada unos P600.00. Ademas en dicho cajon \nestaban guardados P300.00 en billetes y monedas. Asimismo estaban tambien alli \nguardadas las alhajas de la acusada Feliza Monta\u00f1ez que habia dado en prendaa \nlos esposos Saturnino Javier para responder de una dauda de P1005.00 que habia \ntomado de distintas ocasiones. Todas estas alhajas, con el dinero y los dos \ncajones del aparador habian desaparecido. Se noto su desaparacion en la ma\u00f1ana \ndel 7 de Enero del presente a\u00f1o pro Perfecta Bautista, esposa de Saturnina \nJavier, y por tal motivohubo el correspondiente panico en la casa y seguidamente \nSaturnino Javier dio cuenta al jefe de policia, formulando despues la \ncorrespondiente querella. Tanto el jefe de policia como el juez de paz se \nconstituyeron en el entresuelo en donde vivian los esposos Saturnino Javier, y \ndicho juez de paz se incauto del llavero Feliza Monta\u00f1ez, una de cuyas llaves lo \nprobo en la Gerradura del aparador de Perfecta Bautista, y resulto que una de \ndichas llaves podia abrir y cerrar dicho aparador. Tambien dicho funcionario \nhabia declardo que cuando el se constituyo en dicho entresuelo con motivo de la \ndenuncia de Saturnino Javier, noto que Feliza Monta\u00f1ez estaba tembloroso y \npalida.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"En las cinco noches anteriores al suceso, o sea desde el 2 hasta en la noche \ndel 6 de Enero, la Feliza Monta\u00f1ez alli dormia en el entresuelo de Saturnino \nJavier; y en la noche citada del 6 durmieron juntamente Perfecta Bautista con su \nhijo peque\u00f1o y la Feliza Monta\u00f1ez. teniendo hacia sus pies el aparador. En esta \nnoche del 6, segun los esposos Javier, la Feliza Monta\u00f1ez alego que sentia calor \nen dicha noche, y portal motivo pidio que se abriera una de las ventanas que \ndadan al muro, pero que la esposa de Javier se habia opuesto diciendo que los \nanimalitos podian entrar en dicha ventana, pero, sin embargo, accedio a que la \nventana que daba a la cocina del entresuelo se dejara abierta. Asimismo, segun \ndichos esposes, La Feliza Monta\u00f1ez pidio tambien que se apagara la luz, pero que \njavier se opuso porque ellos estaban acostumbrados a dormir con luz; pero, sin \nembargo, la luz que tenia la traslado a una mesita cerca de la purta, de tal \nsurte que el dapartamento del entresuelo en donde dormian Perfecta Bautista, su \nhijo y Feliza Monta\u00f1ez estaba a oscuras en dicha noche del 6. Este departamento \nen donde durmio la Feliza Monta\u00f1ez y en donde estaba el aparador esta se\u00f1alado \nen el croquis Exhibit \"a\" de la acusacion bajo el No. 1, proximo al cual esta la \nvantana hacia la cocina que se dejo abierta. Algunos de los testigos de la \nacusacion habian declarado que Feliza Monta\u00f1ez, en la tarde o noche del 6 de \nEnero, habia dicho que se le habia perdido la llave y trataba de \nbuscarla.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>La perdida de las alhajas de los esposos Javier, de sus cu\u00f1ados y las mismas \nalhajas de la Feliza Monta\u00f1ez dadas en prenda a dichos esposos, esta debidamente \nprobada. <\/p>\n<p>Tambien la criada de los esposos Javier habia declarado que en la madrugada \ndel 7 de Enero, cuando ella se desperto para confeccionar el desayuno habia \nvisto que una de las ojas de la puerta de la calle estaba abierta y por alli \nentraba la feliza Monta\u00f1ez, quedandose sentada por un rato despues de haber \nentrado. Ella, o sea lacriada, siguio confeccionado el dasayuno hasta \nterminarlo, en que sus amos con la Feliza Monta\u00f1ez desayunaron. La falta de la \nalhajas se noto despues ya del desayuno.<\/p>\n<p>La unica cuestion que tiene que resolver la Corte es, si con arreglo a ls \npruebas suministradas por la acusacion, la Feliza Monta\u00f1ez es responsable de \ndicha perdida.<\/p>\n<p>Examinadas las pruebas en conjunto, no. hay pruebas en conjunto, no hay pruba \ndirecta que demonstrase que en la noche o madrugada del 7 de enero del presente \na\u00f1o la Feliza Monta\u00f1ez fuera la que abrio el aparador y sustrajo los dos \ncajones, en uno de los cuales estaban guardadas las alhajas mencionadas y el \ndinero; pero, sin embargo existen varios indicios y circumstancias que inducen a \ncreer racionalmente que el autor de la sustaccion no puede ser otro sino Feliza \nMonta\u00f1ez, aunque probablemente habia sido ayunado por uno de afuera para \nejecutar el hecho con alguna prontitud. La Feliza Monta\u00f1ez habia dormido en la \nnoche del 6 de Enero en el entresuelo de los esposos Javier, tal como se ha \nreferido arriba, y en las otras noches anteriores, y en dicha habitacion no \nhabia nadie mas que ella u Perfecta Bautista y su hijo peque\u00f1o, puesto que la \ncriada y Saturnino Javier dormian en otro departamento. La llave de Feliza \nMonta\u00f1ez se ha demostrado que podia abrir el aparador.<\/p>\n<p>Tambien es hecho confesado por la misma Feliza Monta\u00f1ez que el domingo \nanterior al suceso, o sean dos dias antes, la Perfecta Bautista habia requerido \na Feliza Monta\u00f1ez para que rescatara las alhajas mencionadas, empe\u00f1adus por la \ncantidad de P1005.00 a que ascendia la deuda, aunque hubo cierta discusion entra \nellas respecto a la cuantia, que segun la Monta\u00f1ez, era excesiva, pero que dicha \nliquidacion se efectuaba segun las cantidades que constaban en el cuaderno de \nlos esposos Javier. De estas circunstancias y otras mas anteriormente \nmencionadas se desprende claramente que Feliza Monta\u00f1ez estaba aun disgustada o \nno estaba conforme con la cantidad que le exigia la Perfecta Bautista, por \ncreerla excessiva, o en otros terminos , que creia Monta\u00f1ez que ella no habia \ntomado mas que parte de dicha cantidad. Esta actitud de Feliza Monta\u00f1ez \ndemontraba claramente la no. conformidad con la liquidacion practicada por \nPerfecta Bautista de su deuda. Por lo que se ve, Perfecta Bautista tenia interes \nel que Feliza Bautista tenia interes el que Feliza Monta\u00f1ez le pagara la deuda y \nrescatara las alhajas. Todas estas circunstancias antes mencionadas inducen \nracionalmente a creer que Feliza Monta\u00f1ez, no. estando conforme con la deuda que \nresulto de la liquidacion, temiera que sus alhajas fueran ramatadas por los \nesposos javier, Toda vez que ella pagaba un interes crecido. De tal surte que la \ndesaparacion de sus alhajas del aparador de Perfecta Bautista, juntamente con \nlas otras, y atendidas todas las otras circunstancias que han concurrido en la \nnoche anterior al seceso, nadie mas que Feliza Monta\u00f1ez podia ser la autora de \ndicha sustraccion.<\/p>\n<p>Se alego por la defensa que Monta\u00f1ez estaba convaleciente y que no podia \nllever los cajones del aparador. Pero habiendose presentado por la defensa un \ncajon parecido, resulta que uno de los cajones pesaba unicamente dos kilos y \ntreinta y un gramos. Pero el mismo Doctor Delgado aseguro que la Feliza Monta\u00f1ez \npodia llever un peso de cinco kilos; de tal suerto que el peso total de dos \ncajones no llegaria a cinco kilos, y es perfectamente verosimil creer Feliza \nMonta\u00f1ez podia llevar el peso de los cajones del aparador de Perfecta \nBautista.<\/p>\n<p>Los esposos Javier son parientes de la misma Feliza Monta\u00f1ez y entre ellos, \nantes del suceso de sutos, no habia disgusto alguno; y si se examina en el fondo \nla cuestion, los esposos Javier no tenian interes el que desaparecieran las \nalhajas de zfeliza Monta\u00f1ez, puesto que siendo crecida la deuda y pagando \nMonta\u00f1ez inters si no se rescataban, llegaria el dia en que Monta\u00f1ez no. podria \nrescatarlas, porque la deuda iria creciendo; de tal suerte que Monta\u00f1ez tenia \ninteres en que las alhajas se sacaran del poder de los esposos Javier; pero como \nno podia sacarlas sin pagar antes la deuda, de ahi es que ideara en mala hora la \nsustraccion de dichas alhajas. Se dira tal vez que si Monta\u00f1ez tenia interes por \nsus alhajas, no. se explica el por que se haya apoderado de todas las que habia \nen al cajon, llevandose hasta el cajon. Pero facilamente podra contestarse a \nesta objecion, de que habiendo tenido lugar la sustraccion probalemente a la \nmadrugada, le era dificil a Feliza Monta\u00f1ez hacer la seleccion en la oscuridad \ncomo se encontraba el departamento del entresuelo en donde esteban, separando \nsus propias alhajas de las otras, porque en esta operacion de seleccion se \nemplearia tiempo y podria ser cogida infraganti, y era mas viable el llevarse el \ncajon entero para abreviar tiempo. Y su salida a la puerta de la calle es otro \nde los indicios poderosos de que ella por ese camino ha hecho salir dichos \ncajones hacia la calle, y probablemente otra persona es la que haya recibido de \nella dichos cajones con las alhajas y dinero. Esta deduccion de los hechos o \nindicios arriba referidos, conjuntamente considerados, producen una conviccion \nde que nadie mas que Feliza Mona\u00f1ez podia ser la autora de dicha sustraccion, \nporque todas las circunstances concurren hacia la finalidad del objeto que \ntuviera Feliza Monta\u00f1ez con el fin de recuperar sus alhajas.<\/p>\n<p>From all of the foregoing facts and circumstances, even though many of the \nconclusions are based upon circumstances proof, we are irresistably led to the \nconclusion that the same shows that the defendant committed the crime charged, \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.<\/p>\n<p>The Solicitor-General, in his brief in this court, taking into consideration \nthat the value of the jewelry and money stolen did not exceed 6,250 pesetas, and \nconsidering the aggravating circumstances of abuse of confidence and nocturnity, \nrecommends that the sentence of the lower court be revoked and that the \ndefendant, Feliza Monta\u00f1ez, be sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of 4 \nyears, 9 months and 11 days, and to return to the offended party the jewelry \nstolen, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in \naccordance with the provisions of the law, and to pay the costs.<\/p>\n<p>With this recommendation of the Solicitor-General we entirely agree and it is \nhereby ordered and decreed that the sentence of the lower court he revoked and \nthat a sentence be entered in accordance with the recommendation of the \nSolicitor-General.<\/p>\n<p>It is so ordered.<\/p>\n<p>After the expiration of 10 days from the date hereof 1st Judgment be entered \nin accordance herewith and 10 days thereafter let the record be remanded to the \ncourt from whence it came, for execution.<br\/><\/p>\n<style>\nbody {\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size:80%;\n\tbackground-color:#FFFFFF;\n\tmargin:0 2% 0 2%;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\th1 {\n\t\t\t\t\tfont-family:times;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\th2 {\n\tbackground-color:#cccccc;\n\tpadding:10px 0 10px 0;\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\th3   {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n\ttext-transform: uppercase;\n\ttext-align: center;\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t}\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tdiv#footer \n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tfont-size:9px;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n \n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<\/style><\/div>",

LUIS PEDRE\u00d1OS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This action was instituted for the purpose of securing peaceable possession \nof a considerable quantity of rice of which plaintiff alleges the defendant took \nforcible and unlawful possession. Upon \"the case made by the complaint and \nsupported by the evidence\" the trial judge found that plaintiff was entitled to \nthe possession of the rice and damages in the sum of P3.50.\n<p>The plaintiff (although the allegations of his complaint clearly set forth a \ncause of action for which the proper remedy was a judgment for possession and \ndamages for the unlawful detention) prayed for a preliminary injunction to \nrestrain the defendant from interfering with the rice, and further that the \npreliminary injunction be made permanent upon proof of the allegations set forth \nin his complaint. The trial judge in conformity with the prayer of the complaint \ngranted the preliminary injunction which was made permanent in his final \njudgment, and in the course of the proceedings issued a special order in favor \nof the plaintiff for the possession of the rice.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the defendant and appellant vigorously contend: First, that the \nevidence introduced at the trial in the court below did not sustain plaintiff's \nallegations as to his right of possession; second, that even if the evidence be \nheld to sustain the allegations in the complaint, nevertheless the remedy prayed \nfor was not the proper remedy for the cause of action set forth in the \nallegations of the complaint; and third, that the judgment of the trial court \ngranting a permanent injunction should be reversed and the complaint dismissed \nwith the costs against the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>After a careful review of the whole record we are satisfied that the finding \nof the trial judge in favor of the right of possession of the plaintiff should \nnot be disturbed, and the only question left for consideration is the \ndisposition which should be made of the case as it now stands, in view of the \nmanifest error of the trial judge in granting the remedy by injunction prayed \nfor in the complaint, in addition to the special order for the possession of the \nproperty.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Devesa <em>vs.<\/em> Arbes (13 Phil. Rep., 273), we said, \nquoting the syllabus: \"Injunctions, as a rule, will not be granted to take \nproperty out of the possession and control of one party and to place it into \nthat of another whose title has not been clearly established by law.\" And in \nthat case we further held that the American doctrine limiting the use of \ninjunctions should be applied in this jurisdiction, and that injunctions should \nonly be allowed where there is no other adequate remedy. In the present case the \nplaintiff upon his own allegations would appear to have had an adequate remedy \nin a judgment for possession and for damages for the unlawful taking and \ndetention of the property. <br\/><br\/>In the former case we held as follows: \"We \nare of opinion, however, that the remedy by injunction sought by the plaintiff \nand allowed by the trial court was not the proper remedy for the cause of action \nset out in the pleadings and established by the evidence, and that, in \naccordance with the provisions of section 126 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \nthe court should have granted 'relief consistent with the case made by the \ncomplaint and supported by the evidence and embraced within the issue,' And to \nthat end should have required an amendment of the complaint by striking out the \nprayer for an injunction and substituting therefor a prayer for judgment for \npossession of the land described in the complaint, and upon the complaint thus \namended, judgment should have been rendered in favor of the plaintiff.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the case at bar there can be no doubt that the question clearly embraced \nwithin the issue in the proceedings had in the court below, and in substance and \neffect the question decided by the trial court, was the right of the plaintiff \nto possession; so that if the trial judge, instead of making the preliminary \ninjunction permanent and securing the possession of the rice to the plaintiff in \nthat form, had rendered judgment for possession after requiring an amendment of \nthe complaint, it would have been our duty to affirm the judgment thus rendered. \nWe are unable to discover any practical purpose which would be gained by \nreversing the judgment and dismissing the complaint, the real issue between the \nplaintiff and defendant having been properly adjudicated in the court below. \nFollowing the procedure adopted in the case of Devesa vs. Arbes (supra), we \nthink that an amendment to the complaint should be allowed as in the former \ncase, and that the judgment of the trial court should therefore be amended so as \nto substitute a judgment for possession and damages in the sum of P3.50 for so \nmuch thereof as undertakes to make permanent the preliminary injunction; and \nthus amended we think the judgment of the court below should be affirmed. It \ndoes not seem necessary in this case as in the former case to return the record \nto the court below for this purpose, and unless some sufficient objection be \nmade within ten days from the date of the filing of this opinion, the complaint \nwill be deemed amended and judgment will be entered in this court in favor of \nthe plaintiff for the possession of the rice described in the complaint, and for \ndamages in the sum of P3.50 as found by the trial judge. <\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

That the judgment of the lower court is contrary to law.<br\/><br\/>\"3. That the judgment of the court below is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>After a careful\u00a0 examination of the argument of the appellants in support of each of said assignments of error, we are of the opinion\u00a0 that they may be discussed together.<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 the argument of the appellants\u00a0 in support of\u00a0 their assignments of error, there is but little argument against the decision of the court rendered on the 24th of August, 1912.\u00a0 Practically the whole\u00a0 argument of the\u00a0 appellants\u00a0 is based upon\u00a0 the ground that\u00a0 the original\u00a0 certificate\u00a0 (No. 742, issued July 21, 1906)\u00a0 is absolutely void, For the reason that \"the appellants had no notice of the pendency of the original action to confirm the title of said property.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Appellants now admit that a notice\u00a0 of the pendency of the original action was sent to attorneys Hartigan,\u00a0 Rohde\u00a0 &amp; (Marple?) Gutierrez.\u00a0 Appellants now allege that it affirmatively appears that neither this firm\/nor any of its members represented\u00a0 the defendants and appellants in that action. The record shows, as we have pointed out above, that the original petition showed that Hartigan, Rohde &amp;\u00a0 Gutierrez were the representatives of the heirs of Don Antonio Enriquez, and that notice was duly sent\u00a0 to them.\u00a0 We\u00a0 have searched the record now in vain to find the slightest denial of the fact that they were the representatives of said heirs, even though one of said attorneys represented them,\u00a0 or at least some of them, in the present proceedings.\u00a0\u00a0 So far as the record shows there is not even a suggestion found in the various hearings and proceedings taken and had under the above motions, that said attorneys were not the representatives\u00a0 of the heirs of Don Antonio Enriquez at the time of the original proceedings.\u00a0 Neither does the record show any attempt on their part to deny the fact that they received the notices given\u00a0 in the original\u00a0 action.\u00a0 The appellants assert in their argument that \"personal notice was\u00a0 absolutely necessary in order to justify the court below in rendering a decree in favor of the plaintiff and appellee, in the first instance\"\u00a0 (the original\u00a0 proceeding).\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants, by that argument, attempt to\u00a0 show, not that the judgment of the 24th of August, 1912, was invalid, but that the original certificate (No. 742)\u00a0 was void, because they had not\u00a0 been served with personal notice.\u00a0 This brings us to the question whether or not personal notice to all of the persons interested in an action for the registration of real property under the Torrens system, is an absolute prerequisite to the validity of said\u00a0 registration.\u00a0 It will\u00a0 be remembered that we noted\u00a0 above\u00a0 that personal notice of the pendency of the original petition had been given\u00a0 and that a publication of the same had been made in accordance with the provisions of sections 31 and 32 of Act No. 496.\u00a0 After the expiration of the period during which notice must be given, the original cause was set down\u00a0 for hearing.\u00a0 The record also shows that the clerk of the\u00a0 Land Court made a certificate showing that that notice had been issued and published in accordance with the law.\u00a0\u00a0 Section 32 provides, in part, that said \"certificate of the clerk that he had served the\u00a0 notice as directed by the court, by publishing or mailing, shall be filed in the case before the return day, and shall be conclusive proof of such service.\"<br\/><br\/>On\u00a0 the day set for the hearing of said original petition, no one appeared to oppose the granting of the prayer which it contained. Section 35 of Act No. 496 provides:\u00a0 \"If no person appears\u00a0 and\u00a0 answers within the time allowed, the court may at once, upon motion of the applicant, no reason to the contrary appearing, order a general default to be recorded and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">the application (petition)\u00a0 be taken for confessed.\u00a0<\/span>\u00a0 By the description in\u00a0 the notice,\u00a0 \"<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">To\u00a0 all whom it may concern,<\/span>\" all the world are made parties defendant and shall\u00a0 be concluded\u00a0 by\u00a0 the default and order.\u00a0 The court shall not be bound by the report of the examiner of titles, but may require other and further proof.\"<br\/><br\/>The provisions of\u00a0 section 35 seem to be directly contrary to the contention of the appellants.\u00a0 It\u00a0 seems to\u00a0 directly contradict the requirement of personal notice as an absolute prerequisite to the granting of a valid title under the Torrens system.<br\/><br\/>The same idea is further\u00a0 confirmed by the provisions of section 38 of\u00a0 said Act No. 496.\u00a0 Said section 38 provides that:\u00a0 \"<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Every decree of registration shall bind the land and quiet\u00a0 the title thereto, subject only to the exceptions stated in the following\u00a0 section.<\/span>\u00a0 It shall be conclusive upon and against all <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">persons<\/span>, including the Insular Government, and all the branches thereof, whether mentioned by name in the application, notice or citation, or includes in the general description '<i>To all whom it may concern.<\/i>' \"<br\/><br\/>There is a further and very strong intimation in the law that personal\u00a0 notice is not absolutely a prerequisite to the validity of\u00a0 title\u00a0 under the\u00a0 Torrens system.\u00a0\u00a0 Section\u00a0 32 (Act\u00a0 No. 496) provides that:\u00a0\u00a0 \"The court shall,\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">so far as it deems it possible<\/span>, require proof of actual\u00a0 notice to all the adjoining owners and to all\u00a0 persons who appear to have an interest in or claim to the land included in\u00a0 the application.\" <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">It will be noted also that the petitioner in registration cases is not by law required to give any notice to any person.<\/span> The law requires the clerk of the court to\u00a0 give the notices. (Sections 31 and 32 of Act\u00a0 No. 496.)\u00a0\u00a0 It is true that \"the court may also cause\u00a0 other or further notice of the application to be given in such a manner and to such persons as it may deem proper.\"\u00a0 Thus it is seen that the applicant is by express provision of law relieved from any\u00a0 obligation whatsoever to\u00a0 give notice to any person of the\u00a0 pendency of his application to have his land registered under the\u00a0 Torrens system.\u00a0 That being true, upon what theory may the applicant be subjected\u00a0 to harassment\u00a0 or\u00a0 delay or additional expense, because some person claims that he did not receive actual personal notice?\u00a0\u00a0 Sections 101\u00a0 and 102 (Act\u00a0 No. 496)\u00a0 seem to contain a remedy for persons who have suffered damages for the failure on the part\u00a0 of court officials to comply with the law.\u00a0\u00a0 (Noble State Bank <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.\u00a0 Haskell, 219 U. S., 104.)\u00a0\u00a0 His remedy is not to have the registration and certificate annulled, unless he comes within the provisions of section 38, and even then he is without a remedy against the applicant unless he\u00a0 can show, within a period of one year after the decree of registration and the granting of the certificate, that he has been \"deprived of land or any estate or interest therein,\" <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">by fraud,<\/span> and not even then, if an \"innocent purchaser for value has acquired an interest.\" In the present case five years and a half had transpired and negotiations for the sale of the land to an innocent purchaser had been terminated.\u00a0 There is no intimation that the petitioner is guilty of fraud,\u00a0 in the slightest degree.<br\/><br\/>While the Torrens Land Law is\u00a0 a law of modern times, it has been adopted in many States and its provisions have been attacked at almost every point. The requirement relating\u00a0 to\u00a0 notices has been a fruitful source of litigation. The\u00a0 constitutionality of the law has been attacked many times,\u00a0 because of the provision of said\u00a0 law\u00a0 relating\u00a0 to notices.\u00a0 This is not the first time that the question has been presented to this court.\u00a0 The same question\u00a0 was presented to this court in the case of Grey Alba vs. De la Cruz (17 Phil. Rep., 49).\u00a0 In that case the registered title was attacked upon the ground that fraud existed, simply because personal notice\u00a0 had not been\u00a0 given!) The existence of fraud was predicated upon the failure%f\u00a0 actual personal notice.\u00a0\u00a0 In passing upon that question, this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Trent, said\u00a0 (quoting from the syllabus) :<br\/><blockquote>\"In\u00a0 original proceedings\u00a0 for the registration of land under\u00a0 Act No. 496, the appellee herein was\u00a0 made a party-defendant by publication, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">but\u00a0 was not personally served with notice:<\/span> Held, That the decree of the Court of Land Registration is conclusive against him as well as all the world.\"<br\/><br\/>\"The proceedings for the registration of land, under Act No. 496, are in rem and\u00a0 not<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> in personam<\/span>.\u00a0 A proceeding in rem, dealing with a tangible res, may be instituted and carried to judgment\u00a0 without personal service upon the claimants within the state or notice by name to those outside of it.\u00a0\u00a0 Jurisdiction is secured by the\u00a0 power of the court over the res.\u00a0\u00a0 Such a proceeding would be impossible were this not so, for it would hardly do to make a distinction between the constitutional rights of claimants who were known and those who were not known to the plaintiff, when the proceeding is\u00a0 to\u00a0 bar all.\u00a0 (Tyler vs. Judges, 175 Mass., 71.)\"<\/blockquote>In the present case there is not the slightest intimation that the\u00a0 original applicant\u00a0 (Maria del Consuelo\u00a0 Felisa Roxas\u00a0 y Chuidian) was guilty of fraud.\u00a0 The record shows that she named all the persons who might have an interest in the\u00a0 registration of her land, in her petition.\u00a0 The applicant is not charged even\u00a0 with negligence.\u00a0 The\u00a0 record shows\u00a0 that she did all the law required her to do.<br\/><br\/>In discussing the\u00a0 Torrens\u00a0 Land Law we must keep in mind that its\u00a0 primary purpose is\u00a0 the\u00a0 registration\u00a0 of the title which\u00a0 the applicant or petitioner has\u00a0 and\u00a0 to\u00a0 relieve his land of unknown liens or claims, just qr unjust, against it.\u00a0 The Torrens\u00a0 system of land registration is a system for the registration of\u00a0 title to land only,\u00a0 and not a system established\u00a0 for the acquisition of land.\u00a0 It\u00a0 is not intended that lands may be acquired by said system\u00a0 of registration. It is intended only that the title, which the\u00a0 petitioner has, shall be registered and thereby cleared of all\u00a0 liens\u00a0 and burdens of\u00a0 whatsoever character, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">except\u00a0 <\/span>those which shall be noted\u00a0 in the order of registration and in the\u00a0 certificate issued.<br\/><br\/>If there exist <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">known <\/span>and just claims against the title of the applicant, he gains\u00a0 nothing in effect by his registration, except in\u00a0 the simplicity of subsequent transfers of his title. The registration either\u00a0 relieves the land of all known as well as unknown claims, absolutely, or it compels the claimants to come into court and to make there a record, so that there- after\u00a0 there may be no uncertainty\u00a0 concerning\u00a0 either the character or the extent of such claims.<br\/><br\/>The requirement that personal notice shall be a prerequisite\u00a0 to\u00a0 the validity of registration would absolutely prohibit\u00a0 foreclosure of unknown claims, for the reason that personal\u00a0 notice could never be given to \"unknown claimants\" The great difficulty in land titles arises from the existence of possible\u00a0 unknown claimants.\u00a0\u00a0 Known claimants can be dealt with.\u00a0 They furnish no valid impediment, in fact, to the transfer of titles.<br\/><br\/>Courts have held that in actions in rem personal notice to owners of a res is not necessary to give the courts jurisdiction to deal with and to dispose of the\u00a0 res.\u00a0 (Grey Alba vs.\u00a0 De\u00a0 la Cruz, 17 Phil.

This rule was\u00a0 first established in admiralty proceedings. It was established out of the very necessities of the case. The owner of a ship,\u00a0 for\u00a0 instance,\u00a0 lived in\u00a0 London.\u00a0\u00a0 His ship was found in the most distant ports of the earth.\u00a0 Its operation necessarily\u00a0 required supplies, such as men, coal, and food.\u00a0 The very nature of its business necessitated the making of contracts.\u00a0 The continuance of its voyage\u00a0 depended upon its capacity to make contracts and to get credit. It might also, perchance, cause damage to other craft, in like conditions.\u00a0 To be able to\u00a0 secure all such necessities, to satisfy all possible obligations, to continue\u00a0 its voyage\u00a0 and its\u00a0 business on the high seas, merchants and courts came to regard the \"ship\" as a person, with whom\u00a0 or with which they were dealing, and not its\u00a0 real owner.\u00a0 Consequently there came into existence this action in rem.\u00a0\u00a0 For the purpose of carrying into effect the\u00a0 broader purposes\u00a0 of\u00a0 the Torrens land law, it has been\u00a0 universally considered that the action should be considered as one in rem.\u00a0 Mr. Justice Holmes, then of the Supreme Court\u00a0 of the State of Massachusetts, and now a member of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the\u00a0 case\u00a0 of Tyler vs. Judges (175 Mass., 71), in discussing this question, said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"Looked at either from\u00a0 the point of view of history or of the necessary requirements of justice, a\u00a0 proceeding <i>in rem<\/i>, dealing with a\u00a0 tangible <i>res<\/i>, may be\u00a0 instituted\u00a0 and carried to judgment without personal service upon claimants within the State or notice by name to those outside of it, and not encounter any provision of\u00a0 either constitution\u00a0 (of the State of\u00a0 Massachusetts or the United States).\u00a0 Jurisdiction\u00a0 is secured\u00a0 by\u00a0 the power of the court over the <i>res<\/i>.\u00a0 As\u00a0 we have\u00a0 said,\u00a0 such a\u00a0 proceeding would\u00a0 be\u00a0 impossible were this not so, for it hardly would do to make a distinction between the constitutional rights of claimants who were known and those who were not known to the plaintiff, when the proceeding is to bar all.\u00a0\u00a0 (Pennoyer <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>.

S., 47).\u00a0 In view of the facts and the decisions of the\u00a0 different courts which are cited in that case, it is difficult to understand how it is authority in support of the contention of the appellants here.\u00a0 The facts in that case are as follows :<br\/><br\/>Zeiss, on the 22d of August, 1906, commenced an action in the superior\u00a0 court of the county of San Francisco, alleging in\u00a0 substance that on the 18th and 19th days of April, 1906, a material part of the public records contained in\u00a0 the office of the county recorder of the city and county of San Francisco was\u00a0 destroyed by fire;\u00a0 that on the 18th day of April, 1906, and at the time of the filing of the complaint, he was\u00a0 the owner and in the actual and peaceable possession of the parcels of land in controversy: that his estate, title, interest in and\u00a0 to\u00a0 said parcels of land, and each of them, was that of owner in fee simple, absolute, free from all encumbrances, liens,\u00a0 defects, claims or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever.\u00a0 Under these facts the plaintiff, Zeiss, prayed that he be adjudged to be the owner of and entitled to the\u00a0 possession of said described parcels of land in fee\u00a0 simple, and that no\u00a0 one else had any estate,\u00a0 right, title, interest or claim in or to the same, or any part thereof, either legal or\u00a0 equitable, present or future, vested or contingent.<br\/><br\/>Upon the presentation of the petition by Zeiss, a summons was issued and notice of the pendency of the\u00a0 action was published in certain newspapers,\u00a0 as was required by law. Notice was also posted upon the property, as required by the statute.\u00a0 No one having appeared and opposed the granting of the petition\u00a0 of the complaint, or claimed any interest in or lien upon the property described\u00a0 in the\u00a0 complaint,\u00a0 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">a default was\u00a0 ordered against all persons<\/span>,\u00a0 and on the 19th day\u00a0 of December, 1906,\u00a0 a decree\u00a0 was entered in favor of Zeiss, adjudging that he was the\u00a0 owner in fee\u00a0 simple,\u00a0 absolute, and entitled to the possession of the land described in the complaint and that no other person had any\u00a0 right,title, interest, or estate in and to the same, or any part thereof, either legal or equitable, present or future, vested or contingent.<br\/><br\/>Nothing else seems to have transpired after said decree was issued in favor of Zeiss, until the 26th day of May, 1908, or one year and five months after the entry of the decree of the superior court, in the city and county of San Francisco. On that date\u00a0 (the 26th of May, 1908)\u00a0 an action was brought in the United States Circuit Court for the Northern District of\u00a0 California, in which the plaintiffs claimed title to the parcels of land, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">as owners in fee simple<\/span>, absolute, which had theretofore been decreed to Zeiss.\u00a0 The plaintiff alleged that the decree issued by\u00a0 the\u00a0 superior\u00a0 court of the city and county of San Francisco was void and of no force and effect and was made and maintained without due\u00a0 process of law, and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">that said superior court<\/span>, in said action and proceeding, n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ever had any jurisdiction over the persons holding the title during such proceeding, and that said court\u00a0 did not have or obtain jurisdiction to divest the right, title, interest or estate of plaintiff.<\/span>\u00a0\u00a0 The complaint alleged that \"Zeiss had no right whatever in\u00a0 said parcels of land, other\u00a0 than his right of possession and occupation.\" The bill further alleged that the plaintiffs had been at all times citizens and residents of California, not seeking to evade, but ready to accept service of summons and easily reached for that purpose; that, notwithstanding that fact,<i> no service was made upon them nor did they in any way receive notice of the pendency of the action<\/i> (Zeiss vs. All persons claiming any interest in or lien upon the real property herein described)\u00a0 ;<i> nor did they gain any knowledge of the existence of the decree until more than a year\u00a0 after its\u00a0 entry<\/i>.\u00a0 To the complaint the defendant, Zeiss, demurred.<br\/><br\/>Upon\u00a0 the\u00a0 issue\u00a0 thus presented,\u00a0 the\u00a0 Circuit Court\u00a0 of Appeals for\u00a0 the Ninth District certified the questions involved to the Supreme\u00a0 Court\u00a0 of the United States.\u00a0 The Supreme Court of the United States, after a careful analysis of the facts and of the law, in a very lengthy and instructive opinion (219 U. S., 47), decided each of the questions submitted by the Circuit Court of Appeals against the contention\u00a0 of the plaintiff and returned the cause to the court below.<br\/><br\/>The original action by Zeiss was\u00a0 brought to quiet the title to two parcels of land and for the purpose of registering his title to the same under an act of\u00a0 the legislature of the State of California,\u00a0 entitled\u00a0 \"An\u00a0 act\u00a0 to provide\u00a0 for the establishment and quieting of title to real property in case of loss or destruction of public records.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Said law is known as the McEnerney Law.\u00a0 It\u00a0 was intended by said act to provide a\u00a0 method whereby owners in possession of real estate, where records had been destroyed to such an extent as to make it impossible to trace a record title, might secure a decree in the courts which would furnish public, authenticated evidence of title.\u00a0 The\u00a0 special occasion for the law was the fact\u00a0 that practically all of the\u00a0 public records of title in several counties in the State\u00a0 of California ha4\u00a0 recently theretofore been destroyed as the result of an earthquake and fire.\u00a0 Said law provided that whenever the public records in the office of the county recorder had been, or shall hereafter\u00a0 be lost or\u00a0 destroyed, in whole or in any material part, by flood, fire, or earthquake, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">any person<\/span> who claims an estate of inheritance or have title in, and who has by himself or\u00a0 his tenants, or\u00a0 other persons\u00a0 holding under\u00a0 him, in actual and peaceable possession any\u00a0 real property in said county, may bring and maintain an action <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in rem<\/span>, against all the world, in the superior\u00a0 court for the county in which said real\u00a0 property is situate, to establish his title, and <i>to determine\u00a0 all adverse claims thereto<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The law further\u00a0 provides\u00a0 that an\u00a0 action shall be\u00a0 commenced by the filing of a verified complaint, in which he shall name the defendants as \"all persons\u00a0 claiming any interest in or lien upon the real property herein described, or any part\u00a0 thereof.\"\u00a0 He\u00a0 was required to give in\u00a0 his complaint a particular description of the property.\u00a0\u00a0 The law provided that upon the filing of\u00a0 the complaint, a summons or notice was required to be issued,\u00a0 containing\u00a0 the names of the court and the county in which the\u00a0 action was brought, the name of the plaintiff, and a particular description of the property involved, which notice was directed to \"all persons claiming any interest in or lien upon the real property herein described, or any part thereof,\" as defendants.<br\/><br\/>The law\u00a0 further provided that said summons\u00a0 or notice should be published in\u00a0 a\u00a0 newspaper of general circulation in the county where the action was brought, at least once a week for a period of two months.<br\/><br\/>The law further\u00a0 provided that personal notice should be given to any person claiming an interest in the property or a lien thereon adverse to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The law also provided that said summons or notice should be posted in a conspicuous place on each parcel of property described in the complaint, within fifteen days after the first publication\u00a0 of the summons or notice.<br\/><br\/>The said\u00a0 law further provided that upon the publication and posting of the summons and its service upon and mailing to the person, if any, upon whom it is herein directed to be specially served, the court shall have full and complete jurisdiction over the plaintiff and said property and of the person and every one claiming any estate, right, title, or interest in or to or lien upon said property,\u00a0 or any part thereof, and shall be deemed to have obtained the possession and control of said property, for the\u00a0 purposes of the action,\u00a0 and shall have full and complete jurisdiction to render judgment therein,\u00a0 which is provided for in the law.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the American Land Company <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs<\/span>. Zeiss, cited and relied upon by the appellants, the validity of said law was attacked and the legality of the title granted to Zeiss was impugned for the reason that the law was unconstitutional and void, and because the plaintiff had\u00a0 not received actual notice of the application of Zeiss to have his title quieted, under said\u00a0 law.\u00a0\u00a0 The Supreme Court of the United States (219 U. S., 47) held, as has been above indicated, that the law was constitutional and that a compliance with the requirements\u00a0 of\u00a0 the notice provided for in said law was sufficient to give the court jurisdiction over\u00a0 the res and to enter a valid decree.\u00a0 There seems to be but little in\u00a0 the decision in the case of the American Land Company vs. Zeiss to support the contention of the appellants.<br\/><br\/>Considering that the Legislature of the Philippine Islands had full power to adopt the procedure provided for in Act No. 496, for the registration of the title of lands; and<br\/><br\/>Considering that the court in the original action followed strictly the procedure adopted by said law; and<br\/><br\/>Considering\u00a0 that there is no claim of fraud, actual\u00a0 or constructive, upon the part of any of the parties connected with said action, we are forced to the conclusion that\u00a0 the appellants here are not now entitled to have that judgment or decree of registration and certificate amended\u00a0 or\u00a0 set aside.<br\/><br\/>There remains another question,\u00a0 however, which the\u00a0 appellants have not discussed\u00a0 and which we deem of\u00a0 importance.\u00a0 It is the question of the right of the Land Court to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">correct an error of closure<\/span> in a plan or of a statement contained in a certificate.\u00a0 A plan is prepared and is presented with the petition for the registration of a\u00a0 parcel of land. No opponents appear.\u00a0\u00a0 No\u00a0 opposition is presented to\u00a0 the registration.\u00a0 All the steps in the procedure\u00a0 required by law have been taken.\u00a0 The land is registered.\u00a0 It is then\u00a0 discovered for the first time that by reason of a wrong direction given to one of the lines in the plan,\u00a0 said plan will\u00a0 not close\u2014that if a wall were built\u00a0 upon the lines of the plan, one of the four corners of the wall would\u00a0 not meet.\u00a0\u00a0 We believe that an\u00a0 error of that character may\u00a0 be corrected by the court, provided that such correction does\u00a0 not include land not included in\u00a0 the original petition.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon the question\u00a0 whether the amended plan\u00a0 (p. 252, record) included more or different lands than were included in the original petition, we find the following statement made by one of the judges who ordered said plan amended.\u00a0\u00a0 The statement is:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\"At\u00a0 this stage of the proceedings and on this particular point nothing further is\u00a0 incumbent upon the court than to determine the property as it was adjudicated in this case.<br\/><br\/>\"Therein no new portion was either added or subtracted, and this court finds that such should be the holding on this particular point.\" We have a further statement made by one of the judges, the Honorable Charles H.\u00a0 Smith, relating to the same question, in an answer presented by him to\u00a0 a petition for a writ of prohibition, presented by some of the appellants herein, to the Supreme Court.\u00a0\u00a0 That petition for a writ of prohibition\u00a0 involved practically the same questions presented by the appellants here now.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon the question whether or not additional lands had been\u00a0 included in the new plan (p. 252, record), Judge Smith,\u00a0 in answering for himself and his associates (Ostrand and Romualdez) said:<br\/><br\/>\"Respondents deny that a new dividing line between the premises in question\u00a0 (premises of the plaintiff and appellant) was determined and established by an order\u00a0 of the court issued at the conclusion of said\u00a0 proceedings, but, on the contrary, respondents charge the truth to be that the dividing line between said properties was not changed but simply approved and so indicated upon the record title.\u00a0 For instance, the line between said properties beginning on the south side of the\u00a0 Escolta is exactly at\u00a0 the same point indicated in the original description and approved by the court; in other words, the premises in question of the said Maria del Consuelo Felisa Roxas y Chuidian have not been enlarged ; the boundary lines thereof have not been changed; the\u00a0 real descriptions\u00a0 of the\u00a0 properties have been left undisturbed; the adjoining land owned by the petitioners is undiminished,\u00a0 except possibly as to alleged easements claimed to have been created by the projection of some of the roofs of the petitioners' building over the\u00a0 aforesaid registered prpperty of the said Roxas.\u00a0 That matter is settled\u00a0 clearly by the provisions of\u00a0 the last paragraph of section 39 of Act No. 496.\"<\/blockquote><br\/>We called attention above to the fact that the petitioner alleged that the line A-B of her property ran S., 44\u00b0 30' W., a distance of 31.08 meters, while the plan accompanying\u00a0 said petition (see Exhibit A,\u00a0 page 35,\u00a0 ante)\u00a0 made said line to run S., 46\u00b0 30' W., a distance of 31.08 meters.<br\/><br\/>An examination of the certificate issued to the petitioner (see page 39, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ante<\/span>)\u00a0 also states\u00a0 that the line A-B runs\u00a0 S., 46\u00b0\u00a0 30' W.,\u00a0 for a distance of\u00a0 31.08 meters.\u00a0 The\u00a0 record contains no explanation why the original plan (see Exhibit A, page 35,\u00a0 ante) did not conform\u00a0 to\u00a0 the description of the land given in the petition.\u00a0 That error, in our judgment, seems to have constituted the real difficulty with the closure of the\u00a0 plan.\u00a0\u00a0 Under said conditions we are of the opinion that the Land Court is entirely justified\u00a0 in\u00a0 ordering the plan corrected for the purposes above indicated.<br\/><br\/>There is still another question involved in the case, which the appellants have not discussed, and that is the right of Maria\u00a0 del Consuelo\u00a0 Felisa Roxas y Chuidian to have her original certificate of registration corrected, for the purpose of showing that she was the owner of the buildings located upon the parcel of land in question.\u00a0 It will be remembered that in her petition presented January 12, 1906,\u00a0 she alleged that she was\u00a0 the owner of the\u00a0 parcel of land in question, together with the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">buildings <\/span>thereon.\u00a0 No\u00a0 opposition was presented.\u00a0\u00a0 No objection was made to the registration of the land as described in her petition.\u00a0 The record shows no reason why the buildings should have been omitted in the certificate of\u00a0 registration.\u00a0 The omission\u00a0 must have\u00a0 been an error on the part of the clerk.\u00a0 We find that Act No. 496 contains an express provision for the correction of\u00a0 such errors.\u00a0 Section 112 provides that the registered\u00a0 owner may, at any time, apply by petition to have corrected any \"error, omission, or mistake made in\u00a0 entering a certificate, or any memorandum thereon, or\u00a0 on\u00a0 any duplicate certificate.\"\u00a0 We think the petition\u00a0 presented by\u00a0 Miss Roxas for the correction of such original certificate was entirely within her\u00a0 right under\u00a0 the law.\u00a0 It might be claimed, and we believe that the proposition is\u00a0 sustained by law, that the registration of a parcel of land, unless the\u00a0 record contains something to the contrary, necessarily includes the buildings and edifices located thereon, even though they are not mentioned.\u00a0 Without\u00a0\u00a0 relying\u00a0 upon\u00a0 that proposition of\u00a0 law, however, and\u00a0 in view of the petition of\u00a0 the plaintiff,\u00a0 it is hereby ordered\u00a0 that the original certificate be amended so as to\u00a0 include not only\u00a0 the land described in the original petition, but the buildings located thereon\u00a0 as well. With\u00a0 reference to the petition of\u00a0 the Masonic\u00a0 Temple Association of\u00a0 Manila,\u00a0 the record contains\u00a0 no\u00a0 sufficient reason for not granting the same.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, and in\u00a0 view of all of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the\u00a0 judgment of the court below\u00a0 should be and\u00a0 it is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

From this judgment the defendant appealed.<\/p>\n<p>It appears from the evidence that the defendant, being a municipal policeman \nof the town of Caloocan, did, at about 9 o'clock in the morning of August 13, \n1912, arrest Benigno Aranzanso in the cockpit of Maypajo of that town and take \nhim to the town hall, where he was detained until just before nightfall of the \nsame day, when he was set at liberty by order of the president. But it also \nappears from the same evidence: (1) That both the municipal president and the \nsergeant of police, who was acting as chief of police of the town, had \ninformation that two nights previous a robbery had occurred in a boat on the \nMaypajo River in that jurisdiction, for the boatman had presented himself to the \nsaid sergeant and indicated as one of the assailants of the boat an individual \nwho was the son of one Eto and who had been in a billiard room the same night; \n(2) that on the said night of the 12th of August the Constabulary had been in \nCaloocan to investigate, in company with the policemen of the pueblo, a robbery \nthat had occurred in a billiard room, and the said sergeant had acquired the \ninformation that Benigno Aranzanso had been in that billiard room that night and \nthat about five minutes before he had left on the run; (3) that in view of this \nthe sergeant of police directed not only the defendant Eulogio Sanchez but also \nall the patrolmen under his orders to look for the said Benigno Aranzanso in \norder that he might be identified by the boatmen; and (4) that by virtue of said \norder and because, the description they had given him of the person who had been \nin the billiard room fitted Aranzanso, the defendant Eulogio Sanchez proceeded \nto arrest him in the cockpit on the next morning, the 13th, and took him to the \ntown hall, as has already been stated, where he remained in confinement until \nbefore nightfall of the same day. He was not identified because when the \nsergeant of police arrived at the station he had already been set at liberty. No \nwarrant was previously issued for his detention because the fact had not been \nreported to the justice of the peace and the 13th of August was a legal \nholiday.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant, therefore, acted in compliance with orders of his chief, the \nsergeant of police, in arresting Benigno Aranzanso and his detention was \njustified for the purpose of identifying his person, since, according to the \nsergeant himself, reasonable grounds existed for believing in the existence of a \ncrime and suspicion pointed to that individual.<\/p>\n<p>It was not necessary that the fact of the robbery committed in the boat \nshould have been established in order to regard such detention as legal:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The legality of the detention does not depend upon the fact of the crime, \nbut * * * upon the nature of the deed, wherefrom such characterization may \nreasonably be inferred by the officer or functionary to whom the law at that \nmoment leaves the decision for the urgent purpose of suspending the liberty of \nthe citizen.\" (Decision of the supreme court of Spain, January 27, \n1885.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>One of the duties of the police is to arrest lawbreakers in order to place \nthem at the disposal of the judicial or executive authorities upon whom devolves \nthe duty to investigate the act constituting the violation or to prosecute and \nsecure the punishment thereof. One of the means conducing to these ends being \nthe identification of the person of the alleged criminal or lawbreaker, the duty \nthat directly devolves upon the police to make the arrests or detentions for the \npurposes of such investigation cannot be questioned.<\/p>\n<p>The same supreme court has so declared in a decision of April 21,1884, in a \ncase wherein the person who had threatened another was unknown and suspicion \npointed to a man whom an officer of the law proceeded to arrest. The court said: \n<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The mere fact that an officer of the law compelled a person to appear before \nthe chief of the department to establish or prove his identity does not justify \nthe classification of illegal detention. It was merely in the nature of an \nadministrative measure, justified by the suspicion that he may have made certain \nthreats against another person.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It is, therefore, beyond dispute that the defendant Eulogio Sanchez did not \ncommit the crime charged against him in the complaint, and we therefore reverse \nthe judgment appealed from and freely acquit him; with the costs of both \ninstances <em>de officio.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Truth and Justice, even in the midst of the \npassions and miseries of mankind, cannot be trampled under foot when Providence, \nthe Divine Intelligence, intervenes. Lord, the insufferable Protestant, the \nconstant persecutor of the Faith and her ministers, was unable to prove the \ncomplaint which he presented, through his attorney, Mr. Antonio Maria Jimenez, \nbefore the justice of the peace of Vigan. It could not have been otherwise. The \nintelligent populace of Vigan had expected this result and they were not \nmistaken. The judgment handed down by the upright justice of the peace, Mr. Lupo \nAsurin, is replete with rational logic, which demonstrates his great talent. \nFrom a mere perusal of the judgment, one can not help being satisfied with the \nclearness of expression, the depth of thought, and the simplicity of style. We \nregret that we can not publish it in its entirety because of its \nlength.<br\/><br\/>\"To the Rev. Father Thompkins and the Order to which he belongs \nwe extend our most cordial congratulations, because Innocence emerged triumphant \nin spite of the efforts of her enemies to tarnish her, to cover her with filth \nand human wretchedness. The Catholic Church is also to be congratulated because \nthe acquittal of the Rev. Father Thompkins is her victory against error and \nfalsity, against the mendacity and bad faith of certain miserable creatures who \nhave used their profession to deceive the unwary public and encompass its \nruin.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It is alleged that that part of the last sentence of this article following \nthe word \"victory\" is libelous of the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>Moved by the institution of the present action, the defendant published \nanother article in his newspaper on September 5, 1910, which is reproduced \nbelow:<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">\"OUR EDITOR AGAIN BEFORE THE COURTS OF JUSTICE.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Explanation. Our esteemed editor, Mr. Fidel Reyes, has been again charged \nwith libel before the Court of First Instance of this province. The complainant \nis Mr. Antonio Maria Jimenez, lawyer, druggist, president of the Ilocano \nUniversity, and councilman of this municipality of Vigan, who asks an indemnity \nof ten thousand pesos in his complaint for losses and damages. On learning of \nthis complaint, we felt in the bottom of our heart a sincere pleasure, because, \nbeyond it, we perceived another fine opportunity to demonstrate to the public \nthe sanity of the doctrine for which we stand, and the purity of our motives and \nintentions.<\/p>\n<p>\"The cause of the complaint was our article of last Monday, entitled 'Father \nThompkins Acquitted,' and we are going to reproduce it to-day below in its \nentirety, to satisfy the curiosity of our readers. Here it is:\"<\/p>\n<p>[Here is quoted in full the article already quoted above.]<\/p>\n<p>\"According to the complaint, it is alleged that our words, 'certain miserable \ncreatures who have used their profession to deceive the unwary public and \nencompass its ruin,' alluded to Mr. Antonio Maria Jimenez. Why it is thought \nthat those words refer to Mr. Antonio Maria Jimenez is beyond our comprehension, \nbecause, frankly, our intention was not to censure him in the least, nor did we \nendeavor, through them, to reproach any specific individual with respect to his \nposition or professional honor.<\/p>\n<p>\"We are the first to recognize the <em>nobility<\/em> of character, the \n<em>loftiness<\/em> of purpose, and the <em>probity<\/em> in his dealings which \nMr. Jimenez has always shown in all his acts, social as well as private and \nofficial.<\/p>\n<p>\"In his profession as attorney, all Vigan knows and we are the first to admit \nthat Mr. Jimenez is the No. 1, or, in other words, he is the <em>non plus \nultra<\/em> of his colleagues. Mr. Jimenez is not like other shameless lawyers \nwho undertake the despicable business of pettifogging.<\/p>\n<p>\"In his profession of pharmacist, all Vigan is aware of and we are the first \nto admit his great skill in the various drug-chemical <em>combinations,<\/em> and \nthat Mr. Jimenez has never used his pharmaceutical knowledge to cause harm to \nanyone; Mr. Antonio Maria Jimenez is not the type of other druggists who, \nforgetting the high mission with which they have been endowed by God of \nsuperiority over their neighbors, use their knowledge to satisfy base passions \nand execute dreadful plans.<\/p>\n<p>\"In his profession as proprietor of the Ilocano University, Mr. Jimenez has \n<em>never<\/em> deceived students like certain directors of universities and \ncolleges who issue titles of lawyer or bachelor without even examining the \ncandidates, provided they give them a little <em>money.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\"In his capacity of councilman, we are also the first to recognize his \nactivity.<\/p>\n<p>\"In his domestic relations, all Vigan knows and we are the first to admit \nthat Mr. Jimenez leads a tranquil and happy life in the midst of his family; \nbecause, as a father, he loves his children; and as a husband, affectionate to \nhis wife, because every time he travels he takes with him his sweet \nhelpmate.<\/p>\n<p>\"Finally, we did not endeavor to humiliate any specific person by our \narticle, 'Father Thompkins Acquitted,' much less the famous and celebrated \nlawyer and druggist, Mr. Antonio Maria Jimenez.<\/p>\n<p>\"In conclusion, permit us to say that we do not make this explanation with \nthe intention of disavowing any responsibility, criminal or civil, because we \nare convinced that we have not committed any crime against anyone; rather, we \ndesire to make it plain that our purpose was to oppose the enemies of our Faith, \nas to whom our pen will never rest in showing them the error into which they \nhave fallen, to the end that they may return to the bosom of the Catholic \nChurch, which is the only true religion.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The publication of this article is alleged in the complaint and admitted in \nthe answer; while the allegation in the complaint that it contains satirical \ncomment of the plaintiff, which exposed him to public contempt and ridicule, was \ndenied, the defendant alleging that the words used should be construed in their \ntrue and natural grammatical sense. <\/p>\n<p>We consider that a large part of the testimony introduced at the trial \nrelating to the construction that should be placed on the language of these two \narticle is immaterial. Whether particular witnesses thought that the first \narticle as a whole was defamatory of the plaintiff was wholly incompetent as \nproof of the libelous or harmless character of the publication, as no attempt \nwas made by either party to prove that the language had a double or ambiguous \nmeaning. The efforts of both parties have been confined to a mere construction. \nThe plaintiff has attempted to show that the odium of the last paragraph will be \nattached to him as the attorney for the prosecution in the Thompkins case. The \ndefendant has attempted to show that the criticism in the last paragraph \nreferred to no determinate person, but to those clergy of other religions than \nhis own who resort to deceit in their efforts to inculcate their doctrines and \npromote, in that manner, the interests of their respective creeds. This is-the \nexplanation given in the last paragraph of the second article as amplified in \nthe brief of the defendant on this appeal.<\/p>\n<p>We cannot allow either party to an action for libel to furnish us the meaning \nof an alleged libelous publication which is plain and unambiguous in its terms. \nWere we to accept assistance in such a matter, it would be a confession of our \ninability to understand the official language of this country. This court, and \nin fact every court in the land, is daily engaged in interpreting the meaning \nand import of language used by the people in contracts, wills and all sorts \nof documents which create, establish, or extinguish legal rights and \nliabilities.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The terms of a writing are presumed to have been used in their primary and \ngeneral acceptation, but evidence is nevertheless admissible that they have a \nlocal, technical or otherwise peculiar signification, and were so used and \nunderstood in the particular instance, in which case the agreement must be \nconstrued accordingly.\" (Sec. 290, Code Civ. Proc.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>No attempt has been made to show that the words of either of these articles \n\"have a local, technical, or otherwise peculiar signification.\"<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"No ambiguities appear upon the face of the article. Words of common and \nordinary import alone are used. No technical or provincial terms are contained \ntherein. The names of all the parties in any way connected with the affair are \nplainly given. Under such circumstances, the article is libelous <em>per \nse,<\/em> or it is not libelous at all. If, by fair inferences and deductions \nfrom the article, taken as a whole, it can be said that murder is charged \nagainst plaintiff, then the article is libelous <em>per se<\/em>. And the \ndeductions and conclusions of any number of witnesses looking toward or against \nplaintiff's contention in this regard could not aid the jury in arriving at the \ntrue deduction from the publication. Of necessity, these witnesses simply stood \nupon equal footing with the jurors, and their deductions from the publication \nwere no more likely to be correct than the jurors' deductions. * * * \nNotwithstanding the courts have not all trod the same path upon this question, \nyet of the many cases cited by the respondent we fail to find one that reaches \nthe mark of sustaining the legal admissibility of. the evidence here introduced. \nIndeed, when the article is libelous upon its face, and the party libeled is \nnamed upon, the face of the article, there is no room for the introduction of \nevidence of witnesses as to their understanding of its meaning. * * * We \nconclude that the common import of the words of this article must be applied to \ntest its libelous character. The publisher's intentions are to be gauged by such \nimport. The reader's understanding of it must be based upon such import; and, \nthat being the fact, it is the sole province of the jury to declare its true \nimport from the words used. By such rule the law fully guards the liberty of the \npress, and also at the same time defends the reputation of the citizen against \ndefamation.\" (Hearne <em>vs.<\/em> De Young, 119 Cal, 670.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the recent case of Arnold <em>vs.<\/em> Ingram (138 N. W., 111, 118), the \nsupreme court of Wisconsin said: \"In libel, words are to be understood according \nto their plain and natural import. Where there is no ambiguity in the language \nits meaning is for the court to determine.\"<\/p>\n<p>In Sheibley <em>vs.<\/em> Ashton (130 Iowa, 195), the court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Where the situation is not controlled by matters of inducement or colloquium \npleaded, the question whether a publication relied upon as libelous comes within \nthe statutory definition, and hence is to be taken as actionable <em>per \nse,<\/em> is always a question for the court. (18 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency.,990.) Our \ncases fully recognize the doctrine as thus stated.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As to the effect to be given an alleged libelous article, Townshend on \nSlander and Libel (sec. 139), has the following to say: \"The sense in which the \npublisher meant the language cannot be material. The dicta which apparently \nsanction such a rule will, on a comparison with their context, be found in \nreality to be, not what did the defendant mean, but what properly may he be \ntaken to have meant. How might the language be understood by those to whom it \nwas published. It cannot, therefore, be correct to say that the language is to \nbe construed in the sense in which the publisher intended it to be understood. \n'When a party has made a charge that clearly imputes a crime, he cannot \nafterwards be permitted to say, I did not intend what my words legally \nimply.'\"<\/p>\n<p>In Tawney <em>vs. <\/em>Simonson, Whitcomb &amp; Hurley Co. (109 Minn., 341), \nthe court had the following to say on this point: \"In determining whether the \nspecified matter is libelous <em>per se,<\/em> two rules of construction are \nconspicuously applicable: (1) That construction must be adopted which will give \nto the matter such a meaning as is natural and obvious in the plain and ordinary \nsense in which the public would naturally understand what was uttered, (2) The. \npublished matter alleged to be libelous must be construed as a whole.\"<\/p>\n<p>In applying these rules to the language of an alleged libel, the court will \ndisregard any subtle or ingenious explanation offered by the publisher on being \ncalled to account. The whole question being the effect the publication had upon \nthe minds of the readers, and they not having been assisted by the offered \nexplanation in reading the article, it comes too late to have the effect of \nremoving the sting, if any there be, from the words used in the publication.<\/p>\n<p>Considering the first article quoted above in its entirety, what impression \nwould its perusal leave upon the minds of the people who read it as to the \nattorney who filed the complaint in the Thompkins case? From the rather \nextravagant language used, it is clear that the defendant was exulting over the \nfact that Thompkins was acquitted. The acquittal is referred to as a triumph for \nthe Catholic Church against \"the error and falsity, against the mendacity and \nbad faith of certain miserable creatures who have used their profession to \ndeceive the unwary public and encompass its ruin.\" For the purpose of \ndetermining the effect of this statement we must assume its truth. (Simons \n<em>vs.<\/em> Burnham, 102 Mich., 189; Mosnat <em>vs.<\/em> Snyder, 105 Iowa, \n500.) To whom connected with the Thompkins case could it have referred? \nObviously, the defendant and the court itself must be eliminated. The question \nis therefore narrowed down to the complaining witness and his counsel. Both of \nthese parties are specifically mentioned in the publication, the first being one \nLord, and the latter the attorney Antonio Maria Jimenez, the plaintiff in the \ncase at bar.<\/p>\n<p>In the first sentence of the last paragraph it is stated that Father \nThompkins was innocent, and that an attempt was made to cover his innocence with \nfilth and human wretchedness. In the last sentence it is stated that his \nacquittal was a victory \"against error and falsity, against the mendacity and \nbad faith\" of certain persons referred to as \"miserable creatures who have used \ntheir profession to deceive.\" Assuming that the complaining witness in the \nThompkins case was the object of the author's wrath, would the censure and \ncriticism directed at him in the last paragraph of the publication be apt to \nreflect upon the integrity and professional reputation of his attorney? The \nvitriolic comment on the merits of the charges against the defendant in that \ncase would lead any ordinary person to believe that the charges had been wholly \ntrumped up, were a tissue of lies, were not made in good faith, and were \nintended merely to harass and persecute the defendant; in other words, that the \nmoving witness in the case was practically guilty of malicious prosecution, a \nmost reprehensible act, and made a crime by the laws of all civilized \ncountries.<\/p>\n<p>The professional deportment of members of the bar and bench is, perhaps, \naccorded greater prominence in the forum of public opinion and discussion of the \npresent day than ever before. The legal technicalities and the law's delay, with \nthe consequent defeat of justice in many instances, which had become an \nunbearable burden of an era scarcely yet relegated to the past, have aroused \npublic opinion. The pettifogger, the shyster, who live by sharp practices and \nwhose sole consideration in accepting a case is the offered fee, are responsible \nin no small degree for the present-day criticism of the bar. It is this ilk that \nhave forgotten the oath they took on being admitted to the bar, which reads as \nfollows:<\/p>\n<p>\"* * * I do solemnly swear that I will do no false-hood, nor consent to the \ndoing of any in court; I will not wittingly or willingly promote or sue any \nfalse, groundless, or unlawful suit, nor give aid nor consent to the same; I \nwill delay no man for money or malice, but will conduct myself in the office of \na lawyer within the courts according to the best of my knowledge and discretion, \nand with all good fidelity as well to the courts as to my clients. So help me \nGod.\" (Sec. 18, Code Civ. Proc.)<\/p>\n<p>They are the ones who undertake and press to a conclusion the kind of cases \ndescribed by the epithets in the Article complained of. It is hardly necessary \nto say that the attorney who undertakes such a case is detested as heartily as \nhis client by all honest people. We are clearly of the opinion that the \nconnection of any attorney with such a case as that described in the language of \nthe publication in question will not redound to his credit; that, on the \ncontrary, in the language of section 1 of the Libel Law, it will impeach his \n\"honesty, virtue, and reputation,\" and \"thereby expose him to public hatred, \ncontempt, or ridicule.\" No attempt was made to prove the utter lack of merit in \nthe prosecution of the Thompkins case, alleged in the publication in question. \nWe must assume, therefore, that such comment was altogether unwarranted. The \nconsequence is that no privilege can attach to its publication. The article must \nbe held a libel against the plaintiff, within the purview of section 1 of the \nLibel Law.<\/p>\n<p>The subject of the second article, it must be conceded, is the private and \nprofessional reputation of the plaintiff. The question to be decided is, whether \nthe remarks contained therein are in the nature of a panegyric or a pasquinade. \nHad the remarks of the defendant been limited to the generalities of the second \nparagraph following the quotation of the first article, we are clearly of the \nopinion that there would have been room for no pique on the part of the \nplaintiff. That paragraph taken alone is hardly anything more than an effusive \ndisplay of hero-worship. But the article does not stop at this point. It \nproceeds to take up one by one the various activities of the plaintiff and \nconcludes with a paragraph concerning his private life. <\/p>\n<p>In the first of these the professional ability of the plaintiff as a lawyer \nis discussed. It is asserted that he is the No. 1, or the <em>non plus \nultra<\/em> of his profession, and that all Vigan knows this. We do not think the \naverage reader would place any attorney upon so high a pinnacle, let alone an \nattorney whose activities were practically confined to the city of Vigan, Ilocos \nSur. And the absurdity ofsuch a shining legal light hiding his great talents in \nthat small city heightens the suggestion that the comment is insincere and \nintended to ridicule rather than praise the attorney referred to. \"Praise \nundeserved is slander in disguise.\" (Pope, Epistles of Horace.) Common sense \nwould indicate to the average reader that the author's purpose was not praise, \nand the next sentence of the paragraph offers him an explanation of the real \npurpose of the author. It being apparent that the attorney in question could not \npossibly occupy so high an eminence, the reader, by the second sentence, is \nabruptly invited to look into the sordidness and baseness of the legal \nprofession, and the unpleasant thought immediately suggests itself that here is \nwhere the writer desires to place the subject of the sketch. This conclusion is \nstrengthened, when we remember that pains were taken to reproduce just above the \nfirst publication in its entirety, in which Mr. Jimenez is pointed out as the \nattorney in a prosecution entirely devoid of righteousness.<\/p>\n<p>With this key to the drift of the author's thought, it is easy to interpret \nthe rest of the article. The satirical comment on the plaintiff's professional \nability and reputation as a lawyer being so apparent, it is clear to the reader, \nas he peruses the remainder of the article, that the object of the author in \npraising the plaintiff, followed with a reminder of the sharp practices of the \nblack sheep among druggists and directors of universities, is to convey the \nimpression that he is, in those phases of his activities, what has been so \npointedly suggested of him as an attorney. Finally, the pseudoattempt to prove \nplaintiff's affection for his wife by the assertion that he always takes her \nwith him on all his travels, coupled with the information that she is \"sweet,\" \ncan hardly be considered as anything but a gibe at an eccentricity of the \nplaintiff. The constant repetition, in these paragraphs, that \"all Vigan knows \nand we are the first to recognize\" the various worthy and amiable traits of \nplaintiff's character, and the studied arrangement in each paragraph of praise \nof the plaintiff followed by dispraise of the seamy side of each of the pursuits \nin which he is engaged, put at rest any doubt as to the real purpose of the \nwriter. We are clearly of the opinion that this, article also tends to expose \nthe plaintiff to public contempt, hatred, and ridicule.<\/p>\n<p>The proof introduced by the plaintiff as to injury to his business as a \nresult of the libelous publications of the defendant is not definite enough upon \nwhich to base an award of actual pecuniary damages. The first libel was \npublished on August 29, 1910. The clerk of the court testified that in May, \n1910, plaintiff had appeared in no cases; in June he had appeared in one case \nonly. On September 16 he had appeared in one case. The trial was held on \nNovember 1, 1910. In his own behalf, plaintiff testified that he had appeared in \nabout ten civil cases and four or five criminal cases during the then term of \ncourt. He testified that his business in the justice of the peace court of Laoag \nhad practically ceased since the libel was published, as had also his business \nin Cagayan. So far as the volume of business done by the plaintiff in the Court \nof First Instance is concerned, the fact that he appeared in only one case from \nAugust 29 to the date of the trial, a period of two months, does not tend to \nprove a falling off in his business, when it is remembered that during July and \nAugust, a like period just preceding the trial, his business in the court was \nalso limited to one case. While he testifies in his own behalf that his business \nin Laoag and Cagayan has practically been destroyed by the publication of the \nlibel, no statement is given as to its value. Nor does he attempt to say how \nmuch his business in the Court of First Instance was worth. Obviously, both \nvalue and volume are necessary to any intelligent estimate of damage to the \nbusiness of a professional man. We cannot, therefore, allow him anything for \nthis item.<\/p>\n<p>Notwithstanding that plaintiff has failed to establish actual pecuniary \ndamages, he may recover under section 11 of Act No. 277 damages for injury to \nhis feelings and reputation. These are generally referred to as general damages. \nThe English rule is stated in Odgers on L. &amp; S. (5th, ed., p. 372), as \nfollows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"General damages are such as the law will presume to be the natural or \nprobable consequence of the defendant's conduct. They arise by inference of law, \nand need not therefore be proved by evidence. Such damages may be recovered \nwherever the immediate tendency of the words is to impair the plaintiff's \nreputation, although no actual pecuniary loss has in fact resulted.<\/p>\n<p>\"Such general damages will only be presumed where the words are actionable \nper se. If any special damage has also been suffered, it should be set out on \nthe pleadings; but, should the plaintiff fail in proving it at the trial, he may \nstill recover general damages.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>How nearly this approaches the American rule may be judged from the following \nquotation from Fenstermaker vs. Tribune Pub. Co. (13 Utah, 532; 35 L. R. A. 611) \n:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If the publication was false, the plaintiff was entitled, in the absence of \nallegation and proof of special damage, to such general damages as the law would \npresume to be the natural or probable consequence of the defamatory words. These \ndamages arise by inference of law, and need not be proved by evidence. Such \ndamages may be recovered wherever the immediate tendency of the libelous words \nis to impair the party's reputation, although no actual pecuniary loss has in \nfact resulted. (3 Sutherland, Damages, 2d ed., pars. 1204-1206; Newell, \nDefamation, Slander, and Libel, p. 838 <em>et seq.<\/em>; Wilson <em>vs.<\/em> \nFitch, 41 Cal., 363-386.)\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In considering damage to reputation there must be taken into account the \npublicity given to the publication, the extent to which it tends to expose the \nplaintiff's reputation to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule, and the social \nand business standing of the parties. In estimating damages for injured feelings \nthere should be considered the manner of the publication, that is, whether the \nmethod of publication tends to add ignominy to the natural effects of the \npublication. Also, those factors which enter into the assessment of damages for \ninjury to reputation must influence the injury to plaintiff's feelings. \nPlaintiff's feelings, in this sense, are considered to be the mental suffering, \nshame, and humiliation experienced by him as a result of the libel.<\/p>\n<p>While the statement of these abstract rules for the ascertainment of damages \nto feelings and reputation is practically free from difficulty, their \napplication to particular cases is a difficult matter. In England and America \nthe measure of damages is left entirely to the jury. The following comment from \nGraham &amp; Waterman on New Trials (second ed., p. 451), as quoted in Minter \n<em>vs.<\/em> Bradstreet Co. (174 Mo., 444), explains the attitude of courts in \nthose countries with reasonable clearness:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The reason for holding parties so tenaciously to the damages found by the \njury in personal torts is, that in cases of this class there is no scale by \nwhich the damages are to be graduated with certainty. They admit of no other \ntest than the intelligence of a jury governed by a sense of justice. * * * To \nthe jury, therefore, as a favorite and almost sacred tribunal, is committed, by \nunanimous consent, the exclusive task of examining the facts and circumstances, \nand valuing the injury and awarding compensation in damages. The law that \nconfers on them this power, and exacts of them the performance of this solemn \ntrust, favors the presumption that they are actuated by pure motives, * * * and \nit is not until the result of the deliberation of the jury appears in a form \ncalculated to shock the understanding and impress no dubious conviction of their \nprejudice and passion, that courts have found themselves compelled to \ninterpose.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In this jurisdiction all the functions of the Anglo-Saxon jury, except in \nthose few cases wherein assessors sit at the special request of the parties, \ndevolve upon the trial judge. It is not necessary for us to say now whether an \nassessment of damages found by the trial judge should carry the same or less \nweight than the findings of a jury for the reason that the plaintiff was allowed \nno damages in the court below. We are given plenary power, however, to affirm, \nmodify, or reverse all decisions brought to us on appeal, when the evidence is \nbefore us; and we are of the opinion that the test to be applied to an award of \ndamages is much the same as that applied to any other finding of fact by the \ntrial judge. Such an award must appear reasonable in view of all the evidence of \nthe case and the presumption of correctness attaching to findings of fact made \nby a trial court. And when, as in the case at bar, this court is called upon to \nfix those damages <em>imprimis,<\/em> or when it can not agree with the award \nmade by the trial court, it will endeavor, in accordance with the rules laid \ndown above, to fix the damages of the plaintiff at a reasonable amount. To \nattempt a more definite formula for the assessment of damages to the feelings \nand reputation of libeled plaintiffs, would be to invite what it is our purpose \nto avoid, namely, erroneous bases of calculation. After a consideration of all \nthe evidence of record, we fix the damages to plaintiff's feelings and \nreputation at P300.<\/p>\n<p>Plaintiff has further asked for punitive or exemplary damages. Plaintiff may \nprove in aggravation subsequent remarks defamatory of the plaintiff. (Townshend, \nL. &amp; S., p. 650.) Refusal to retract a libelous publication is evidence of \naggravation. It is proper to show the conduct of the defendant from the \npublication of the libel to the rendition of judgment as evidence of express \nmalice or ill-will. Evidence may be given of antecedent or subsequent libels or \nslanders to show <em>quo animo<\/em> the words were published (Odgers, L. &amp; \nS., 5th ed., p. 390). Punitive damages may be given where there is actual malice \nor a reckless disregard of plaintiff's rights. (Cases digested in 12 Dec. Dig., \nLibel and Slander, sec. 120 (2).) The authorities are eminently satisfactory and \nharmonious upon this point, and they are, we believe, applicable to the facts of \nthe present case. The first publication was libelous <em>per se.<\/em> The second \npublication, a pretended disavowal of the first, was also libelous <em>per \nse,<\/em> and contains a reproduction of the first publication. No better \nevidence of express malice and ill-will toward the plaintiff could be afforded \nthan a sham \"explanation\" that a previous libelous publication did not refer to \nthe plaintiff. Such conduct dispels any doubt as to the original intention of \nthe author, indelibly stamps his opinion of the injured person as contemptuous \nif not worse, and invites his auditors to share in his opinion. We have also \nobserved in the perusal of the testimony taken in open court, a degree of \nacrimony and captiousness in the questions put to the plaintiff concerning his \nprofessional ability and his private life, a considerable number of which were \nput by the defendant himself, entirely inappropriate to the defense of a charge \nof exposing a fellow man to public contempt and ridicule. For these reasons, \nexemplary damages should be allowed. We fix these damages at P200. <\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is therefore reversed and total damages are \nawarded to the defendant in the sum of P500. Without costs. <\/p>\n<p><em>Carson, J.,<\/em> concurs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Moreland<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> concur in the \nresult.<br\/>Judgment reversed.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

Paterno against the city of Manila, held that the \nword 'land' as used in section 1 of Act No. 975 of the Philippine Commission \nincludes both the land and the, buildings thereon. As construed by the city \nassessor and collector the word 'land\/ as used in the above-mentioned Act, did \nnot include the improvements upon the land, and therefore the credit of \nP2,121.80 allowed by the city assessor and collector on the tax lists for the \nyear 1903 as a partial payment of the tax on your property located at Nos. \n98-104 Escolta, known as lot 3, block 35, district of Binondo, was erroneously \napplied according to the construction of the said Act by the Supreme Court in \nthe cases above stated, since the total value of the property in question, as \nper assessment in 1901 and 1902, was not 50 per cent more than the value fixed \nby the board of tax revision, although the value of the land was 50 per cent \nmore for 1901 and 1902 than that fixed by the board of tax revision.<\/p>\n<p>\"By direction of the Municipal Board of Manila, approved by His Excellency, \nthe Governor-General, the amount above stated which has been applied as a \npartial payment of your real estate tax for 1903 has been entered on the tax \nlists for 1903 and is a lien upon the said property, which can only be removed \nby the payment of the proper amount.<br\/><br\/>\"By authority contained in a \nresolution adopted by the Municipal Board on December 10, 1910, the payment of \nthe said sum, which is a delinquent tax for 1903, will be accepted without \npenalty if made within twenty days from the date this communication is received \nby you.<\/p>\n<p>\"Very respectfully,<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Sgd.) \"ELLIS CROMWELL,<\/p>\n<p>'Collector of Internal Revenue,<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Ex Officio City Assessor and Collector.\"<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To clear her property of this alleged encumbrance and to prevent the \ncollector from carrying into effect his threat to sell the property at public \nsale, plaintiff, under protest, paid to the city assessor and collector the \nP2,121.80 demanded, which sum is now in special deposit in the Insular Treasury \nawaiting the outcome of this action.<\/p>\n<p>This action was begun by the plaintiff to recover the said amount paid as \naforesaid. The learned trial court dismissed the complaint on the merits and \nthis appeal is taken from that judgment.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant states its position in this controversy as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"From the figures set forth above, relating to plaintiff's property, it \nappears that the land alone was assessed during 1901 and 1902 at more than 50 \nper cent, in fact 70 per cent, above the valuation fixed for 1903, but that the \nland and improvements together were assessed during 1901 and 1902 at less than \n50 per cent, in fact, only 38 per cent, above the valuation fixed for 1903. \nConsequently, if the word 'land' as used in Act No. 975 were to be construed as \n'land only' then plaintiff was entitled to a refund of a certain amount of \nexcess paid, but if by 'land' the legislature contemplated 'land and \nimprovements' or 'real estate in general' then the plaintiff was not entitled to \nany refund. The city assessor and collector erroneously adopted the former \nconstruction as the correct one and estimated that the proper amount of refund \nof the excess payment by the plaintiff for the years 1901 and 1902, as provided \nin Act No. 975, would be the sum of P2,121.80. * * * <\/p>\n<p>\"Subsequent to this payment, however, the Supreme Court decided in the case \nof Felipe Zamora <em>vs.<\/em> City of Manila (7 Phil. Rep., 584) that the word \n'land' as used in Act No. 975 should not be construed in a limited sense but \nthat it was intended by the legislature to include not only the land as such but \nalso the improvements thereon. The city assessor and collector, by direction of \nthe municipal board approved by the Governor-General, then addressed a letter to \nthe plaintiff explaining the mistake of the collector made in 1903, and stating \nthat this amount of P2,121.80 had been entered upon the tax lists for 1903, and \nthat it was a lien upon her property only to be removed by payment of the proper \namount, which if paid within a certain time would be received without penalty. \nThis the plaintiff then paid to the city assessor under protest and now brings \nthis action for the recovery back of the P2,121.80 so paid.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From what has been said, it is clear that the basic contention of the city is \nthat the city assessor and collector erroneously, and, therefore, unlawfully, \nrefunded to the plaintiff herein, when she paid her tax in 1903, the sum of \nP2,121.80, and that, having so wrongly and unlawfully refunded the said amount, \nthe city is entitled to recover from the plaintiff that sum by the process, as \nthe city council called it, of putting it on the tax lists for 1903. The reason \nfor claiming that this sum was unlawfully and erroneously refunded is that the \nword \"land,\" as used in Act No. 975, was held by the Supreme Court in the case \nof Zamora <em>vs.<\/em> City of Manila (7 Phil. Rep., 584).. to include the word \n\"improvements,\" and that this Act requiring also, prior to the right to refund \nin any given case, that the assessments for the years 1901 and 1902 should be \nmore than 50 per cent higher than was the assessment of the same property in \n1903, the basis on which the right rests does not exist, for, while the land \nitself was assessed in 1901 and 1902 about 70 per cent higher than it was in \n1903, the improvements upon the land were assessed almost twice as high in 1903 \nas in 1901 and 1902, and while a rebate might be allowed upon the assessment on \nthe land if it had not been held by the Supreme Court to include improvements, \nno rebate can, in fact, be allowed, because the assessments of the land and \nimprovements, under the decision referred to, <em>must be taken,<\/em> that is, \nadded, <em>together;<\/em> and that being the case, the assessments of both land \nand improvements for the years 1901 and 1902 were not, when added together, 50 \nper cent higher than the total of the two was in 1903. As a necessary result, \nsays the city, the refund was improper.<br\/><br\/>This contention may be answered \nin two ways. In the first place, section 46 of Act No. 183 provides that \"it \nshall be the duty of every owner of real estate in the city of Manila to prepare \nor cause to be prepared a statement of the amount of land and the improvements \nthereon which he owns.\" This statement must be filed with the city assessor and \ncollector and from it, primarily, he makes up the list of the taxable real \nestate in the city. Under the system established by this Act and by the practice \nwhich was adopted and has been consistently followed under it, the improvements \nare assessed separately from the land even though both may be owned by the same \nperson. This was the way the assessment was made in 1901, 1902, and 1903, and it \nis the manner in which assessments have been made since that time. This was the \ncondition of assessments when the remedial Act referred to was passed and \npresents the situation which the commission had before it. This being so, it \nmight with propriety be contended that an owner of land might have been entitled \nto the refund provided for in Act No. 975 with respect to the land itself \nalthough he would not have been with respect to the improvements. The fact that \nthe Supreme Court held, in the case referred to, that, under the statute, land \nincluded improvements, does not necessarily mean that the contention of the city \nis correct that the assessment for both land and improvements as made in 1901 \nand 1902 should have been added together and the sum of the two compared with \nthe total assessments for land and improvements as made in 1903 before it could \nbe determined whether the taxpayer was entitled to a refund. In the case \nreferred to the plaintiff, as guardian for his minor children, brought suit \nagainst the city of Manila to recover the excess taxes paid to the city under \nthe assessments of 1901 and 1902. The assessments for that year were, land \nP7,700, and house P8,000. In 1903 the assessment was, land P4,476, and house \nP5,000. The plaintiff claimed a right to the refund on both the land and the \nhouse but the department of assessments and collections of the city allowed it \non the land only, denying the benefits of the Act with regard to the \nimprovements upon the theory that the Act referred to land only. This court held \nin that case that, inasmuch as the statute was remedial, the plaintiff was \nentitled, under the liberal construction given to that kind of statute, to a \nrefund not only as to the taxes on the land but also as to those on the \nimprovements. In that case the assessments were treated separately, the one \nrelating to the land and the other to the improvements, each one standing upon \nits own footing, the plaintiff evidently being permitted to claim her right as \nto each apart from the other.<\/p>\n<p>In the second place, it may be said, in answer to the city's contention that \nthere was no reassessment made in 1903 of the improvements assessed in 1901 and \n1902, and that, therefore, there was no basis from which it could be determined \nwhether the improvements were assessed higher in 1901 and 1902 than they were in \n1903 or vice versa. When the assessment was made by the commission in 1903 the \ntaxpayer was engaged in making very extensive improvements upon the premises, to \na large extent rebuilding the buildings already thereon. It is undisputed that \nshe was adding at least P25,000 worth of repairs to the premises at that time. \nIt is very probable that, in making the assessment, the commission took into \nconsideration these improvements and added their value to the improvements as \nthey were assessed in 1901 and 1902. This appears to be so not only from the \nfact that it was at that time impracticable to assess the improvements as they \nexisted in 1901 and 1902, but also from the fact that the assessed valuation of \nthe improvements in 1903 was almost double what it was in 1901 and 1902. This \nlatter fact is significant for the reason that the assessments in 1901 and 1902 \nwere almost universally excessive\u2014so much so in fact that it led the Legislature \nin 1903, as we have seen, to pass a special Act for a reassessment of city \nproperty and the refunding of money paid as taxes under the excessive \nassessments of those years. This being the case, it would be but fair to assume \nthat, if the improvements as assessed in 1901 and 1902 had been assessed in \n1903, the value thereof would have been largely reduced. As a matter of fact, \nhowever, due undoubtedly to the extensive improvements that were then being \nmade, the assessment of the improvements in 1903 was almost double that in 1901 \nand 1902.<br\/><br\/>We believe it, therefore, a necessary conclusion that the city \nerred in adding the assessment of the improvements as made in 1903 to the land \nassessment of that year in order to determine whether or not the plaintiff was \nentitled to the refund in question. As we have already intimated, the \nimprovements as assessed in 1901 and 1902 no longer existed when the assessment \nof 1903 was made, and that, in reality and as matter of fact, no assessment was \nmade in 1903 of the improvements assessed in 1901 and 1902. As a necessary \nresult, we have no basis from which we may compare the assessment of the \nimprovements of 1903 with those of 1901 and 1902. If the plaintiff can gain \nnothing from this fact, she certainly should lose nothing from it. The land \nassessed in 1901 and 1902 was the same land assessed in 1903 and upon that land \nalone she was entitled to the refund of P2,121.80, which was made to her when \nshe paid her taxes in 1903. If the improvements had been assessed in 1903 the \nsame as they were in 1901 and 1902, then the total of the assessments for 1901 \nand 1902 would have been more than 50 per cent higher than the total as assessed \nin 1903. It was only the addition in 1903 of about P20,000 to the assessed \nvaluation of the improvements made in 1901 and 1902 that, even under the theory \nof the city, removed the plaintiff's claim from the provisions of the statute, \nthe total assessments in 1901 and 1902, under that theory, not being 50 per cent \nmore than the total assessment in 1903. It is clear, therefore, that plaintiff \nwas entitled to the refund with respect to her 1903 taxes, that the refund was \nduly authorized by a resolution of the municipal board, and that she received it \nas a credit upon her taxes pursuant to that resolution.<br\/><br\/>It is our \nopinion, therefore, that the taxes for 1903 were duly paid and the lien thereof \nfully discharged, and that the demand made by the defendant upon plaintiff that \nshe again pay the taxes for that year was without authority of law and \nunenforceable. Such demand placed upon the plaintiff no duty except that of \nselecting a legal method of contesting the validity of defendant's claims. She \nselected the method of paying the sum demanded, under protest, and beginning an \naction to recover it, following the procedure prescribed in ordinary tax cases. \nIn doing that she was entirely justified, it appearing that the city claimed \nthat the taxes for 1903 had not been paid, that they were a lien upon the \nplaintiff's property, and that, if they were not paid, proceedings would be \ntaken to seize and sell said lands by virtue thereof; and, particularly in view \nof that provision of the tax law which requires that, before the validity of a \ntax can be attacked or a decision obtained therein in the courts, the tax must \nbe paid under protest and an action begun for its recovery. It is reasonable \nthat a man who denies the legality of a tax should have a clear and certain \nremedy. The rule being established that, apart from special circumstances, he \ncannot interfere by injunction with the state's collection of its revenues, an \naction at law to recover back what he has paid is the alternative left. Of \ncourse, we are speaking of those cases where the state is put to an action where \nthe citizen refuses to pay. In these latter he can interpose his objections by \nway of defense, but when, as is common, the state has a more summary remedy, \nsuch as distress, and the party indicates by protest that he is yielding to what \nhe cannot prevent, courts have been a little too slow to recognize the implied \nduress under which the payment is made. But even if the state is driven to an \naction, if at the same time the citizen is put at a serious disadvantage in the \nassertion of his legal rights by defense in the suit, justice may require that \nhe should be at liberty to avoid those disadvantages by paying promptly and \nbringing suit on his side. He is entitled to assert his supposed rights on \nreasonably equal terms. (Atchison etc. Ry. Co. <em>vs.<\/em> O'Connor, 223 U.

(See Exhibit \"A\", B. of E. p. 20).<\/p>\n<p>On the 17th day of August, 1911, the defendant Isaac Madrazo presented a \ndemurrer, in which he alleged that the plaintiffs \"no tienen personalidad para \nentablar la demanda\"; that there existed a confusion of parties and that the \nfacts stated in the complaint were not sufficient to constitute a cause of \naction.<\/p>\n<p>On the 26th day of September, 1911, said demurrer was denied.<\/p>\n<p>On the 29th day of September, 1911, the defendant Isaac Madrazo filed his \nanswer, consisting of a general and special denial. In his general denial he \nadmitted all of the facts alleged in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the complaint. \nIn his special denial or defense he alleged that neither the plaintiffs nor \ntheir mother (Paulian Locson) had desired to cultivate said land nor to pay any \nof the expenses relating thereto; that they had refused to pay the taxes upon \nsaid land; that the plaintiffs had failed to make any demand or claim for the \nland in question for a period of nearly thirty years; that Macario Madrazo had \ndied and that he did not have any interest whatever in the land in question. The \ndefendant Isaac Madrazo claimed that he was entitled to b\u00ab repaid for all of the \nexpenses and improvements which he had placed upon said land.<br\/><br\/>Upon the \nissue thus presented, the Judge, upon the 27th day of October, 1911, rendered \nhi\u00bb decision and found that the plaintiffs were without right in the premises \nand dismissed the action.<\/p>\n<p>On the 3rd day of November, 1911, the attorneys for the plaintiffs excepted \nto the said Judgment and made a motion for a new trial. Upon a consideration of \nthe motion for a new trial, the lower court found that his decision was contrary \nto law, set it aside and granted a new trial.<\/p>\n<p>On the 10th day of November, 1911, after the new trial had been granted, the \nattorney for the defendant, Isaac Madras o, presented a motion, asking for \npermission to amend his complaint. Said motion was supported by an affidavit. In \nthe affidavit he alleged that he had admitted the allegations in paragraph 4 of \nthe original complaint by mistake, and that he was the reel owner of the land in \nquestion; that Juan Madrazo had no interest in said Iand4 The motion to amend \nwas denied by the court on the 19th day of January, 1918. To that ruling of the \ncourt the defendants duly excepted.<\/p>\n<p>Later the plaintiffs and defendants, by agreement, submitted the cause anew \nupon the proof which had been presented during the first trial. Upon a \nreconsideration of said proof, the Honorable Charles A. Low, Judge, found that \nthe defendant, Isaac Madrazo, was the owner of an undivided one-third part of \nthe land in question; that the seven plaintiffs were jointly the owners in \ncommon of an undivided one-third of the land in question, and ordered that the \nland be divided among paid parties. The lower court further provided that the \nparties might themselves, if they desired, make a partition in accordance with \nhis conclusions.<\/p>\n<p>From that decision, after a motion for a new trial, which was denied and \nexception thereto taken, the defendant, Isaac Madrazo, appealed to this court \nand made the following assignments of error:-<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">I.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"No permitir al demandado enmendar la contestacion a la demanda despues, de \nla orden del Juzgado concediendo nueva vista peticion de los demandantes y de \nhaber sido declarada anulada la sentencia.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">II.<\/p>\n<p>\"No haber ordenado se iniciaran los abintestados de los finados Juan Madrazo \ny Camila Natividad conyuges causantes de las partes en este asunto, y de Paulina \nMadrazo madre de los demandantes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p align=\"center\">III.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Haber ordenado el reparto y adjudicacion de bienes a los demandantes sin \nhaber Justipresiado, el trabajo, gastos y mejoras introducidas por el demandado \nYsaac Madrazo.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The appellant complains that the lower court committed error in not \npermitting him to amend his complaint after the new trial had been granted. He \nrelies upon the provisions of Article 110 of the Code of Procedure in Civil \nActions. Article 110 permits the parties, in the furtherance of Justice, to \namend their pleadings at any stage of the action in either the Court of First \nInstance or the Supreme Court, by the adding or striking out of the names of any \nparties or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party or a mistaken or \ninadequate allegation or description in any other respect, so that the actual \nmerits of the controversy may speedily be determined without regard to \ntechnicalities.<\/p>\n<p>It will be remembered that the lower court ordered a new trial on the 9th of \nNovember, 1911. On the 10th of November, 1911, the attorney for the defendant \npresented a motion asking permission to amend his answer. Said motion, however, \ndoes not indicate in what particular he desired to amend his answer. On the 16th \nof January, 1912, however, he filed an affidavit in which he indicated that he \nhad made a mistake in admitting the facts alleged in paragraph 4 of the original \ncomplaint. It is assumed that the defendant, by said affidavit, which was \npresented two months after the motion to amend was presented, intended to \nindicate to the court in what particular he desired to amend his answer. \nParagraph 4 of the original complaint is an allegation that the said Juan \nMadrazo, the father of the defendant and grandfather of the plaintiffs, at the \ntime of his death left certain property described in said paragraph. The \naffidavit alleges that, even though admitting that the said Juan Madrazo \noccupied the said land at the time of his death, he did not have either the \nright of possession or ownership in said land, and further indicated that the \ndefendant, Isaac Madrazo, was the exclusive owner of said property.<\/p>\n<p>If it be true that the land described in paragraph 4, did not in fact belong \nto their grandfather at the time of his death, they certainly have no right of \ninheritance in the same, and proof of absolute ownership in the defendant, Isaac \nMadrazo, would, of course, defeat their right. We find, however, upon reading \nparagraphs 2 and 3 of the special answer of the defendant, that he, in fact, \nadmitted that the plaintiffs had an interest in the land and that he had, for \nthat reason, requested then to assist in working It and to pay the taxes, etc. \netc. Not only does the defend any thus admit the interest of the plaintiffs, \nTaut In his general answer he also admitted the relation of the plaintiffs and \nthe defendant - that they are the heirs of Juan Madrazo - but also admitted that \nat the time of the death of Juan Madrazo, he (Juan Madrazo) was the owner of the \nland in question. Moreover, not only did the defendant admit that Juan Madrazo \nwas the owner of the land at the time of his death, and that the plaintiffs are \nhis co-heirs, but he permitted the plaintiffs to prove, without objection, all \nof said admissions. We think, in view of all the allegations and proof, that the \nlower court did not commit the errors complained of.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the other assignments of error, we are of the opinion, \nconsidering all of the facts, that the errors complained of were not committed. \nThe judgment of the lower court is therefore hereby affirmed, and without any \nfinding as to costs, it is so ordered.<\/p>\n<p>After the expiration of 10 days from the date hereof, let judgment be entered \nin accordance herewith, and 10 days thereafter let the record be returned to the \ncourt from whence It came, for execution.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

If you make the line straight, it will put certain logs and trees \non your land.\"<\/p>\n<p>To this the accused replied: \"Those logs are there simply for the purpose of \nmarking my land.\"<\/p>\n<p>Francisco replied: \"Why are you not satisfied with the line just as it was \nwhen we took possession of our respective lands?\"<\/p>\n<p>To this the accused replied: \"This is false.\" Saying this he drew his knife \nand struck at Mendoza. <\/p>\n<p>On attempting to ward off the blow Mendoza was cut in the left hand. The \naccused continued the attack, whereupon Mendoza seized the accused by the neck \nand the body and threw him down. While both were lying upon the ground the \naccused still sought to strike Mendoza with his dagger. The latter seized the \nhand which held the dagger and attempted to loosen his hold upon it. While they \nwere thus, fighting for the possession of the knife, the wife of the accused \ncame forward and took the dagger from her husband's hand, throwing it to one \nside. She then seized Mendoza by the neck and threw him from her husband, who \nafter various maneuvers, struck Mendoza a blow which knocked him senseless.<\/p>\n<p>As a result of the fight Mendoza received three wounds, two in the chest and \none in the left hand, the latter being the most serious, the extensor tendon in \none of the fingers having been severed. The wounds were cured in seven days at a \ncost of about P45, but the middle finger of the left hand was rendered \nuseless.<\/p>\n<p>The story of the affair told by the accused is quite different from that just \nrelated, but the facts as stated were as found by the trial court and the \nevidence given fully supports the findings. We have examined, the case carefully \nand see no reason why it should be reversed upon the facts. We may say the same \nas to the law.<\/p>\n<p>The accused asserts that he should have a new trial upon the ground that if \nhe should be given another opportunity to present evidence he would be able to \nshow by a physician, Gregorio Limjoco, that the finger which the court found to \nhave been rendered useless by the cut already described was not necessarily a \nuseless member, inasmuch as, if the accused would permit a surgical operation, \nthe finger could be restored to its normal condition. He also asserts that he \ncould demonstrate by the physician referred to that it was not the middle finger \nthat was disabled but the third finger instead.<\/p>\n<p>We do not regard the case made as sufficient to warrant a new trial. It is \nimmaterial for the purposes of this case whether the finger, the usefulness of \nwhich was destroyed, was the middle finger or the third finger. All agree that \none of the fingers of the left hand was rendered useless by the act of the \naccused. It does not matter which finger it was.<\/p>\n<p>Nor do we attach any importance to the contention that the original condition \nof the finger could be restored by a surgical operation. Mendoza is not obliged \nto submit to a surgical operation to relieve the accused from the natural and \nordinary results of his crime. It was his voluntary act which disabled Mendoza \nand he must abide by the consequences resulting therefrom without aid from \nMendoza.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

SEVERINO CAMARA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">Severino Camara was charged before the Court of First Instance of Tayabas \n\"with having, in December, 1912, taken and received from Calixto Berbari, as the \nrepresentative of Berbari Hermanos, the sum of P425.10 for the purchase, on \ncommission, of copra, and with having appropriated the said sum to himself, to \nthe prejudice of Berbari Hermanos.\" (Complaint filed by the fiscal.)\n<p>The record shows that from this sum of P425.10 there must be deducted the \namount of P8.50, which, according to the document presented in evidence by the \nsaid Calixto Berbari, is the value of one sack of rice that Berbari sold to \nCamara on credit. This being the actual fact, the charge made in the complaint \nis unfounded, to wit, that the defendant appropriated to himself money, goods, \nor other personal property received on commission for the purchase of copra, and \ntherefore he cannot be guilty of the crime of estafa, but is a debtor for the \nprice of the sale. Paragraph 5 of article 535 of the Penal Code does not, nor \ncan it, specify a contract of sale as one that gives rise to the obligation to \ndeliver or to return the thing received, as occurs with contracts for \nsafe-keeping, or of commission, or administration, and others such as \n<em>commodatum,<\/em> which certainly involve the obligation to deliver or return \nthe thing received. A person who buys rice on credit becomes the owner of it and \nindebted for its price, but is not guilty of the crime of estafa by reason of \nnot paying for it. Hence, the sum which the defendant is alleged to have \nembezzled is not P425.10, as stated in the complaint, but P416.60.<\/p>\n<p>Besides this reduction, the trial court makes another of P36.06, the value of \nthe copra furnished by the defendant, as admitted by Berbari in his testimony. \nConsequently the amount specified in the complaint should be reduced to \nP380.54.<\/p>\n<p>Severino Camara was an agent of Berbari Hermanos for the purchase of copra on \ntheir order and account. On February 1, 1913, the manager of Berbari Hermanos \nfiled a complaint of estafa for the aforesaid sum of lP!425.10. During the trial \nhe was required to present a statement of the accounts of Severino Camara with \nthe firm, which he did, and. that statement now appears in evidence on page 61 \nof the record. The title reads as follows: \"Extract from the account current of \nMr. Severino Camara with Messrs. Berbari Hermanos, Atimonan.\" And at the close : \n\"1913\u2014January 31\u2014Balance due us from him (for this balance he was sued in the \njustice of the peace court of Atimonan) <em>P425.10.\"<\/em> It is evident that \nthe sum mentioned in the complaint as having been taken and received on \ncommission is the balance of an account containing entries of amounts received \nby Camara and amounts received by Berbari Hermanos.<\/p>\n<p>As the settlement of account ended with a balance sued for in the justice of \nthe peace court, it also began with a balance likewise sued for in the Court of \nFirst Instance. The account begins thus: \"1911\u2014September 30\u2014Balance in our \nfavor, as per receipts (for this balance suit was instituted against him), \nP413.35.\" Notwithstanding this, in May, 1912, the account with Severino Camara \nwas resumed to the extent that, on October 31st of that year, the <em>debit<\/em> \namounted to P3,467.69 and the <em>credit<\/em> to P1,621.82.<\/p>\n<p>In this trial, the manager of Berbari Hermanos, on cross examination by the \ndefense, testified that in November, 1912, Camara was sued before the Court of \nFirst Instance for the sum of P1,700 and was absolved; and that Camara executed \na contract of sale, under right of repurchase, of two parcels of coconut land, \ncontaining an area of 6 hectares planted to 700 coconut trees, for the price of \nP1,722.50, stipulating the term of one year for their redemption. This price of \nP1,722.50 was undoubtedly security for the payment of the said balance of P1,700 \nand appears in the said settlement of November 12,1912. Hence, on this date, \nNovember 12, 1912, there was no balance in favor of Berbari Hermanos for which \naction could be brought as a sum embezzled, but there was only an amount owed by \nthe defendant as the price he would have to pay in case of the repurchase of \nthose two parcels of land. Subsequent to this date and up to December 29,1912, \nvarious items continued to be debited, up to a total of P729.58, among which \nwere four of P8.50, each of which must have been, as was seen, the price of one \nsack of rice, and various items were also <em>credited<\/em> to an aggregate \ntotal of P770. Hence there is a balance, not in favor of, but against Berbari \nHermanns, and yet, on January 31, 1913 there appeared the \"balance in their \nfavor sued for in the justice of the peace court of Atimonan\" that is the \nsubject matter of the present case, to wit, P425.10.<\/p>\n<p>Such are the actual facts disclosed by the record. They are the proven facts. \nA grave error is committed by bringing a criminal complaint for estafa in order \nto collect a sum alleged to be due, when such amount is nothing but the price of \nthe parcels of land which the vendor sold, should he desire to repurchase them, \nfor, if the repurchase is not effected, the vendor; far from being a debtor, is \nfor various reasons a creditor.<\/p>\n<p>And even though the said settlement of the account kept by the creditor \nhimself should disclose that a balance was actually due him, he is not entitled \nto bring a criminal action for estafa by reason of such balance in order to \nobtain its payment by first imprisoning the debtor.<\/p>\n<p>A mere shortage in an account does not prove the misappropriation and \nabstraction for which punishment is provided in the code. (Decisions of June 9, \n1884, and November 7,1889.) If a previous settlement is necessary in order to \ndetermine the balance, as in the present case, where the court ordered one to be \nmade, the crime of estafa does not exist. (Decision of May 5, 1886.) Delay in \nthe execution of a commission, or in the delivery of a sum received by reason \nthereof, only involves civil liability. (Decisions of November 24, 1886, and \nDecember 23, 1890.) In the case at bar there was not even any delay, for, after \nall, there was only an agreement to repurchase pending. When, in February, 1912, \nthe criminal complaint was filed, the defendant was not in debt to the \ncomplainant, even if we take into account the items owed for the rice purchased \non credit, which cannot form the basis of an action for estafa.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed and the defendant is acquitted, \nwithout special finding as to the costs in this instance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson, Moreland<\/em>, and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> \nconcur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

Germana Viernes answered by alleging that the land claimed from her \nis not and never has been the plaintiff's, but belongs to the Roman Catholic \nChurch in its parish of Bacarra, Ilocos Norte, to which constantly for over \nthirty years she, her husband, and their children have been paying a yearly \nrental on the lease by virtue whereof they have been possessing it. The parish \npriest of Bacarra intervened and was included as a defendant in the case.\n<p>This land originally belonged to Fausto Albano, who in July 1879, bequeathed \nit to the parish of Bacarra for a series of masses, as appears from the copy of \nhis will, which is a valid document, not impugned either in or outside of this \ncase. Moreover the witnesses presented by the defendants corroborate the fact \nand the title of possession, as well on the part of the lessor parish as on the \npart of the lessee family.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff absolutely lacks an original title to the land he claims. It \nseems that he fabricated a title in the following way. He declared it for \nassessment, changing a boundary or two. He failed to pay the land tax, wherefore \nthe land was put up at public auction. He bought it in himself with a bid of 49 \ncentimos, and in a year there was executed in his favor an instrument of sale of \nsaid land, over 50 ares in area, for the price of 49 centimos. This is the title \n(Exhibit A) he has presented. This plaintiff was a half or uterine brother of \nthe legator Fausto Albano, and was like him a Catholic, well informed about the \nchurch's property, as he was the agent for collecting the rental for the parish. \nBut he went to the so-called Independent Church and it seems that his idea was, \nthat between one church and the other it would be better for the independent one \nto enjoy it. It was so held in the judgment appealed from when the statement was \nmade therein that the plaintiff \"claims that the donation be now made to the \nIndependent Filipino Church instead of the Roman, which is improper, for that \nchurch did not exist and \u00a3he will must undoubtedly have referred to the Roman, \nwhich was at that time the only church in Bacarra, and with this claim Ruperto \nEdralin in 1909 made judicial demand for himself for paddy (the rental) and now \nfor the land itself, bringing forward an instrument that does not refer to the \nland in question.\"(B. of E.,11.)<br\/><br\/>The claim must have arisen from the \nfact, attested by Germana Viernes and Luis Albano, that when the Spanish curates \nceased to administer the parish of Bacarra they were succeeded therein by the \nFilipino curates Ignacio Noriega, Servando Castro, and Atanasio Albano, during \nwhose administration, or at least that of the first two, he was the agent for \nthe collection of the rental the lessees of the land paid, and he must have \nceased to be a collector. If after 1903 (Exhibit A) he was the owner of the land \nthat he had bought at public auction for the price of 49 centimos, it is \ninexplicable why he continued to act as collector of the rental in the name of \nthe parish priests Noriega and Castro, who, as was proven at the trial, were \nAglipayans, and it did not occur to him until December of 1910 to enforce that \ntitle of purchase for the price of 49 centimos, and not in 1909, to have brought \nan action to recover the rental from the same defendant he now sues for \nownership, an action which failed.<\/p>\n<p>Such are the facts that have twice occupied the attention of this court by \nreason of that variation in the boundaries. It is a notoriously impudent claim, \ndevoid of any basis.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from, whereby the defendants are absolved from the \ncomplaint, is affirmed with the costs and it is held that the land claimed is \nthe exclusive property of the Roman Church; with the costs of this instance \nmoreover against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson, Moreland,<\/em> and A<em>raullo, JJ.,<\/em> \nconcur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

Both contained iron, but in amounts not \nstated. According to the circulars of the manufacturer the beneficial effects \nfrom both preparations result from the combination of iron and cinchona, the \nwine preparation being for those patients for whom it is more palatable than the \nsirup. This literature of the manufacturer further narrates that the medicinal \nproperties of iron and cinchona combined had long been known, but that until \nsuccess had crowned the experiments of Monsieur Laroche, the originator of these \npreparations, no combination had been evolved which could be administered \nwithout unpleasant effects to the patient. The preparation is sold under a \ndistinctive manufacturers' label, and the process of manufacture is claimed to \nbe a secret. The chief claim made for it is that it is a tonic; and that such is \nits use was the testimony of Doctor Newberne. Although the cinchona is dissolved \nand combined with the iron in both preparations, it is insisted, for the \nimporters, that the general words \"in whatever form\" used in paragraph 320 of \nthe Tariff Act are sufficiently comprehensive to include both of these \npreparations.<\/p>\n<p>The tariff cannot be applied to an imported article by seizing upon one of \nits constituent elements and claiming that the classification of that particular \nelement is the classification of the article. Few, indeed, are the articles \nsubject to the tariff which are irreducible and indivisible. It has never been \nthe practice to analyze an article seeking entry under a tariff act and give to \neach of its constituents that classification which it would have if imported \nalone, let alone classifying the aggregate under the name of one of its parts. \nIn the present case, cinchona is a common element to both preparations. So also, \nbut in a much larger quantity, is alcohol.<\/p>\n<p>Why should the mixture be called cinchona rather than alcohol? It is \napparent, however, that neither designation is correct. The question to be \ndetermined is, What is the article as a whole? This is well illustrated in the \ncase of Meyer <em>vs.<\/em> Arthur (91 U. S., 570; 23 L. ed., 455.) In that case \nthe importers asked that certain articles known as white lead, nitrate of lead, \noxide of zinc, and dry and orange mineral be classified as \"all metals not \nherein otherwise provided for, and all manufactures of metals of which either of \nthem is the component part of chief value * * *.\" A chemical analysis of each of \nthese preparations disclosed that by far the greater percentage of each \nconsisted of one or another minerals.<\/p>\n<p>The court said: \"When the Act speaks of 'manufactures of metals,' it \nobviously refers to manufactured articles in which metals form a component part. \nWhen we speak of manufactures of wood, of leather, or of iron, we refer to \narticles that have those substances respectively for their component parts, and \nnot to articles in which they have lost their form entirely, and have become the \nchemical ingredients of new forms * * *. The truth is that, in the nature of \nthings, a metal and its oxide or sulphate are totally distinct and unlike. Any \nsubstance subjected to a chemical change by uniting with another substance loses \nits identity; it becomes a different mineral species. The basis of common clay \nis the metal aluminium, and the basis of lime is the metal calcium. But no one \nwould think of calling clay and lime metals; nor, if artificially made, would he \ncall them manufactures of metals. They have lost all their metallic qualities. \nIn just the same manner, iron ceases to be iron when it becomes rust, which is \noxide of iron; or when it becomes copperas, which is sulphate of iron. None \nwould think of calling blue vitriol copper. So white lead, nitrate of lead, \noxide of zinc, and dry or orange mineral are not metals; they have no metallic \nqualities. In the poverty of language, they have no distinct names, it is true, \nas lime and clay and vitriol have; but each is designated by a scientific \nperiphrasis, in which the name of the metal which forms one of its chemical \nelements is used. This use of the name has probably been one cause of the \nconfusion which has arisen on the subject.\"<\/p>\n<p>For the defendant it is insisted that both of the preparations in question \nshould be classified as proprietary medicines under the definition of that term \nin section 5, supra. Both are put up in bottles bearing labels designed with \nconsiderable care, and have stamped thereon the facsimile signature of Monsieur \nLaroche, all of which conforms with the practice adopted in more recent times by \nthe manufacturers of many proprietary and patent medicines which have gained a \nreputation, in order to prevent imitations being sold to the public. All of \nthese precautions certainly tend to restrict the sale of the article to that \nprepared by the manufacturers themselves. But, aside from this, it seems clear \nthat the preparation falls within the italicized words of section 5, as the \nmanufacturer of the preparations under consideration expressly claims that the \nprocess of manufacture is a secret.<\/p>\n<p>A case analogous to the one at bar was that of Ferguson <em>vs.<\/em> Arthur \n(117 U. S., 482; 29 L. ed., 979). Calcined magnesia was a well-known medicinal \npreparation, a formula therefor being contained in all the dispensatories. The \nquestion was whether \"Henry's Calcined Magnesia\" should be classified as a \nproprietary medicine or as \"magnesia, calcined.\" That \"Henry's Calcined \nMagnesia\" was universally known by that name and had a character of its own, \ndistinctive from the ordinary article, although used for the same purpose; that \nit had been prepared by the same family for one hundred years and sold on the \nmarket at more than double the price of the American preparation of the highest \nrepute; that it had a peculiar reputation on account of the nicety with which it \nwas prepared; that each bottle bore a trade-mark and was accompanied with \nliterature warning the public against imitations, and claiming that the calcined \nmagnesia prepared by them \"will be found to be perfectly deprived of carbonic \nacid, free from taste, smell, or other disagreeable property, and without \nroughness or grittiness to the touch or the palate;\" were facts held sufficient \nto justify its being called a proprietary medicine.<\/p>\n<p>The preparation now in question is not a mere refinement of the commercial \narticle known as cinchona bark or any of its derivatives. Its only claim for \nclassification with such drugs is the fact that it contains a small percentage \nthereof. Precautions against imitations and the same claims of special process \nin preparation are made for it as were made for \"Henry's Calcined Magnesia.\"<\/p>\n<p>In Arthur <em>vs.<\/em> Stephani (96 U. S., 125; 24 L. ed., 771), where the \nquestion was whether chocolates put up in confectionery form should pay duty as \nconfectionery or as chocolate, <em>eo nomine,<\/em> it was held that the latter \nclassification should prevail, after stating the following rule for the \nconstruction of tariff acts: The case \"presents the question whether the \narticles are dutiable under general terms which may embrace them, or under that \nspecific language which can be applied to nothing else. That the latter is the \nrule by which the duty is fixed is too well settled to require argument.\"<\/p>\n<p>In Robertson <em>vs.<\/em> Salomon (130 U. S., 412; 32 L, ed., 995), the \nCollector of Customs classified \"white beans\" as \"vegetables\" under the general \ncategory of \"articles of food.\" The importers insisted that they should be \nadmitted free as seeds, \"not otherwise specified.\" In holding that white beans \nshould be classified as \"foods\" the court disapproved of an instruction to the \njury below to the effect that \"the commercial designation of the article, or \nwhat the article is called in trade and commerce * * * has nothing to do with \nthe question.\"<\/p>\n<p>The Supreme Court said: \"We think the court erred in this instruction. The \ncommercial designation, as we have frequently decided, is the first and most \nimportant designation to be ascertained in settling the meaning and application \nof the tariff laws. (Citing several cases.) But if the commercial designation \nfails to give an article its proper place in the classifications of the law, \nthen resort must necessarily be had to the common designation.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the present case, even on the assumption that the general phrase \"in \nwhatever form\" in paragraph 320 is sufficiently comprehensive to include the \nmedicinal preparations in question, it seems clear that the specific language of \nparagraph 78 (a) is also applicable, and must therefore govern under the rule of \nArthur vs. Stephani, supra. Again, these preparations would undoubtedly be \ntermed proprietary medicines by \"the trade\" and patent medicines or nostrums by \nthe public generally.<\/p>\n<p>At the trial, a letter from the Collector of Customs to the Director of \nScience asking for an analysis of the articles in question, and the latter's \nreply, in which it is stated that the .articles should be classified under \nparagraph 320, was admitted in evidence over the objection of the defendant. \nThis was manifestly error.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Clearly it is not the province of the expert to act as judge or jury. Hence, \nall questions calling for his opinions should be so framed as not to call upon \nhim to determine controverted questions of fact, or to pass upon the \npreponderance of testimony. Thus, it would obviously be improper to ask the \nwitness to state his opinion upon all the testimony in the case as to any given \nquestion, if the truth or part of such evidence were in dispute. When the \nquestion is so framed as to call upon the expert to determine on which side the \nevidence preponderates or to reconcile conflicting statements, he is in effect \nasked to decide the merits of the case which is a duty wholly beyond his \nprovince. Whatever liberality may be allowed in calling for the opinions of \nexperts or other witnesses, they must <em>not usurp the province of the court \nand jury<\/em> by drawing those conclusions of law or fact upon which the \ndecision of the case depends.\" (Jones on Evidence, sec. 372.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>For the reasons above stated, the judgment appealed from is reversed, and the \narticles in question are held to be dutiable under paragraph 78 (<em>a<\/em>) of \nthe Tariff Act of 1909.<\/p>\n<p>Let judgment be entered accordingly.

ADRIANO PANLILIO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the \nProvince of Pampanga convicting the accused of a violation of the law relating \nto the quarantining of animals suffering from dangerous communicable or \ncontagious diseases and sentencing him to pay a fine of P40, with subsidiary \nimprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs of the trial.\n<p>The information charges: \"That on or about the 22d day of February, 1913, all \nof the carabaos belonging to the above-named accused having been exposed to the \ndangerous and contagious disease known as rinderpest, were, in accordance with \nan order of a duly-authorized agent of the Director of Agriculture, duly \nquarantined in a corral in the barrio of Masamat, municipality of Mexico, \nProvince of Pampanga, P. I.; that, on said date and at said place, the said \naccused, Adriano Panlilio, illegally and voluntarily and without being \nauthorized so to do, and while the quarantine against said carabaos was still in \nforce, permitted and ordered said carabaos to be taken from the corral in which \nthey were then quarantined and conducted from one place to another; that by \nvirtue of said orders of the accused, his servants and agents took the said \ncarabaos from the said corral and drove them from one place to another for the \npurpose of working them.\"<\/p>\n<p>The defendant demurred to this information on the ground that the acts \ncomplained of did not constitute a crime. The demurrer was overruled and the \ndefendant duly excepted and pleaded not guilty.<\/p>\n<p>From the evidence introduced by the prosecution on the trial of the cause it \nappears that the defendant was notified in writing on February 22, 1913, by a \nduly authorized agent of the Director of Agriculture, that all of his carabaos \nin the barrio of Masamat, municipality of Mexico, Pampanga Province, had been \nexposed to the disease commonly known as rinderpest, and that said carabaos were \naccordingly declared under quarantine, and were ordered kept in a corral \ndesignated by an agent of the Bureau of Agriculture and were to remain there \nuntil released by further order of the Director of Agriculture.<\/p>\n<p>It further appears from the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution \nthat the defendant fully understood that, according to the orders of the Bureau \nof Agriculture, he was not to remove the animals, or to permit anyone else to \nremove them, from the quarantine in which they had been placed. In spite, \nhowever, of all this, the carabaos were taken from the corral by the commands of \nthe accused and driven from place to place on his hacienda, and were used as \nwork animals thereon in the same manner as if they had not been quarantined.<\/p>\n<p>The contention of the accused is that the facts alleged in the information \nand proved on the trial do not constitute a violation of Act No. 1760 or any \nportion thereof.<\/p>\n<p>We are forced to agree with this contention.<\/p>\n<p>The original information against the accused charged a violation of section 6 \nof Act No. 1760 committed by the accused in that he ordered and permitted his \ncarabaos, which, at the time, were in quarantine, to be taken from quarantine \nand moved from one place to another on his hacienda. An amended information was \nfiled. It failed, however, to specify the section of Act No. 1760 alleged to \nhave been violated, evidently leaving that to be ascertained by the court on the \ntrial.<\/p>\n<p>The only sections of Act No. 1760 which prohibit acts and pronounce them \nunlawful are 3, 4 and 5. This case does not fall within any of them. Section 3 \nprovides, in effect, that it shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or \ncorporation knowingly to ship or otherwise bring into the Philippine Islands any \nanimal suffering from, infected with, or dead of any dangerous communicable \ndisease, or any of the effects pertaining to such animal which are liable to \nintroduce such disease into the Philippine' Islands. Section 4 declares, \nsubstantially, that it shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation \nknowingly to ship, drive or otherwise take or transport from one island, \nprovince, municipality, township, or settlement to another any domestic animal \nsuffering from any dangerous communicable disease or to expose such animal \neither alive or dead on any public road or highway where it may come in contact \nwith other domestic animals. Section 5 provides that whenever the Secretary of \nthe Interior shall declare that a dangerous communicable animal disease prevails \nin any island, province, municipality, township, or settlement and that there is \ndanger of spreading such disease by shipping, driving or otherwise transporting \nor taking out of such island, province, municipality, township, or settlement \nany class of domestic animal, it shall be unlawful for any person, firm or \ncorporation to ship, drive or otherwise remove the kind of animals so specified \nfrom such locality except when accompanied by a certificate issued by authority \nof the Director of Agriculture stating the number and the kind of animals to be \nshipped, driven, taken or transported, their destination, manner in which they \nare authorized to be shipped, driven, taken, or transported, and their brands \nand distinguishing marks.<\/p>\n<p>A simple reading of these sections demonstrates clearly that the case at bar \ndoes not fall within any of them. There is no question here of importation and \nthere is no charge or proof that the animals in question were suffering from a \ndangerous communicable disease or that the Secretary of the Interior had made \nthe declaration provided for in section 6 or that the accused had driven or \ntaken said animals from one island, province, municipality, township or \nsettlement to another. It was alleged in the information and proved on the trial \nthat the animals had been exposed to a dangerous communicable disease and that \nthey had been placed in a corral in quarantine on the premises of the accused \nand that he, in violation of the quarantine, had taken them from the corral and \nworked them upon the lands adjoining. They had not been in the highway nor moved \nfrom one municipality or settlement to another. They were left upon defendant's \nhacienda, where they were quarantined, and there worked by the servants of the \naccused.<\/p>\n<p>The Solicitor-General in his brief in this court admits that the sections \nreferred to are not applicable to the case at bar and also admits that section 7 \nof said Act is not applicable. This section provides: \"Whenever the Director of \nAgriculture shall order any animal placed in quarantine in accordance with the \nprovisions of this Act, the owner of such animal, or his agent, shall deliver it \nat the place designated for the quarantine and shall provide it with proper \nfood, water, and attendance. Should the owner or his agent fail to comply with \nthis requirement the Director of Agriculture may furnish supplies and attendance \nneeded, and the reasonable cost of such supplies and attendance shall be \ncollectible from the owner or his agent.\"<\/p>\n<p>We are in accord with the opinion expressed by the Solicitor-General with \nrespect to this section, as we are with his opinion as to sections 3, 4, and 5. \nThe law nowhere makes it a penal offense to refuse to comply with the provisions \nof section 7, nor is the section itself so phrased as to warrant the conclusion \nthat it was intended to be a penal section. The section provides the means by \nwhich the refusal of the owner to comply therewith shall be overcome and the \npunishment, if we may call it punishment, which he shall receive by reason of \nthat refusal. It has none of the aspects of a penal provision or the form or \nsubstance of such a provision. It does not prohibit any act. It does not compel \nan act nor does it make the refusal to comply unlawful, nor does it really \npunish or impose a criminal penalty. The other sections of the law under which \npunishments may be inflicted are so phrased as to make the prohibited act \nunlawful, and section 8 provides the punishment for any act declared unlawful by \nthe law.<\/p>\n<p>The Solicitor-General suggests, but does not argue, that section 6 is \napplicable to the case at bar. Section 6 simply authorizes the Director of \nAgriculture to do certain things, among them, paragraph (c) \"to require that \nanimals which are suffering from dangerous communicable diseases or have been \nexposed thereto be placed in quarantine at such place and for such time as may \nbe deemed by him necessary to prevent the spread of the disease.\" Nowhere in the \nlaw, however, is the violation of the orders of the Bureau of Agriculture \nprohibited or made unlawful, nor is there provided any punishment for a \nviolation of such orders. Section 8 provides that \"any person violating any of \nthe provisions of this Act shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not \nmore than one thousand pesos, or by imprisonment for not more than six months, \nor by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court, for each \noffense.\" ' A violation of the orders of the Bureau of Agriculture, as \nauthorized by paragraph (c), is not a violation of the provisions of the Act. \nThe orders of the Bureau of Agriculture, while they may possibly be said to have \nthe force of law, are not statutes and particularly not penal statutes, and a \nviolation of such orders is not a penal offense unless the statute itself \nsomewhere makes a violation thereof unlawful and penalizes it. Nowhere in Act \nNo. 1760 is a violation of the orders of the Bureau of Agriculture made a penal \noffense, nor is such violation punished in any way therein.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, it is contended by the Government that if the offense stated in the \ninformation and proved upon the trial does not constitute a violation of any of \nthe provisions of Act No. 1760, it does constitute a violation of article 581, \nparagraph 2, of the Penal Code. It provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A fine of not less than fifteen and not more than seventy pesetas and \ncensure shall be imposed upon: * * *<\/p>\n<p>\"2. Any person who shall violate the regulations, ordinances, or \nproclamations issued with reference to any ep\u00a3dwnic disease among animals, the \nextermination of locusts1, or any other similar plague.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It is alleged in the information and was proved on the trial that the Bureau \nof Agriculture had ordered a quarantine of the carabaos at the' time and place \nmentioned; that the quarantine had been executed and completed and the animals \nactually segregated and confined; that the accused, in violation of such \nquarantine and of the orders of the Bureau of Agriculture, duly promulgated, \nbroke the quarantine, removed the animals and used them in the ordinary work of \nhis plantation. We consider these acts a plain violation of the article of the \nPenal Code above quoted. The fact that the information in its preamble charged a \nviojation of Act No. 1760 does not prevent us from finding the1 accused guilty \nof a violation of an article of the Penal Com. The complaint opens as follows: \n\"The undersigned accuses Adriano Panlilio of a violation of Act No. 1760, \ncommitted as follows:\" Then follows the body of the information already quoted \nin this opinidn. We would not permit an accused to be convicted under one Act \nwhen he is charged with the violation of another, if the change from one statute \nto another involved a change of the theory of the trial or required of the \ndefendant a different defense or surprised him in any other way. The allegations \nrequired under Act No. 1760 include those required under article 581. The \naccused could have defended himself in no different manner if he had been \nexpressly charged with a violation of article 581.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of United States vs, Paua (6 Phil. Rep., 740), the information \nstating the facts upon which the charge was founded terminated with this \nexpression: \"In violation of section 315 of Act No. 355 of the Philippine \nCommision in effect on the 6th of February, 1902.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the resolution of this case the Supreme Court found that the facts set \nforth in the information and proved on the trial did not constitute a violation \nof section 315 of Act No. 355 as alleged in the information, but did constitute \na violation of article 387 in connection with article 383 of the Penal Code, and \naccordingly convicted the accused under those articles and sentenced him to the \ncorresponding penalty.<\/p>\n<p>In that case the court said; \"The foregoing facts, duly established as they \nwere by the testimony of credible witnesses who heard and saw everything that \noccurred, show beyond peradventure of doubt that the crime of attempted bribery, \nas defined in article 387, in connection with article 388 of the Penal Code, has \nbeen committed, it being immaterial whether it is alleged in the complaint that \nsection 315 of Act No. 355 of the Philippine Commission was violated by the \ndefendant, as the same recites facts and circumstances sufficient to constitute \nthe crime of bribery as defined and punished in the aforesaid articles of the \nPenal Code.\" (U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Lim San, 17 Phil. Rep., 273; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> \nJeffrey, 15 Phil. Rep., 391; U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Guzman, 25 Phil. Rep., 22.)<\/p>\n<p>The accused is accordingly convicted of a violation of article 581, paragraph \n2, of the Penal Code, and is sentenced to pay a fine of seventy pesetas (P14) \nand censure, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and the costs \nof this appeal.

Lobingier, judge, wherein he held that the plaintiff had not established any \nright to the relief sought and therefore adjudged that she take nothing by her \ncomplaint and that the first two defendants recover their costs.\n<p>On March 5, 1913, counsel for Hermogena Santos filed a complaint in the Court \nof First Instance of this city and alleged therein that on March 1,1905, \nSantiago Herrera and his wife Basilia Tolentino, in an instrument ratified \nbefore a notary, deeded to the plaintiff a building lot with three warehouses, \nthe boundaries and area of the said land being described in the complaint; that \nthe plaintiff entered into possession of this property on the date above \nmentioned and held the same without opposition or interruption of any sort and \ncollected the rents therefrom until January 28, 1913; that on this date, Miguel \nRobledo, who was found to be a creditor of the said Santiago Herrera by a \njudgment rendered in case No. 9874 against the said Herrera, prayed for the \nexecution of the said judgment; that at the instigation of Robledo, the sheriff \nproceeded to seize the said lot and, after the publication of notice, sold the \nsame at public auction on the 17th of the following month of February; that, \nalthough the plaintiff had intervened and prayed for the recall of the writ for \nthe reason that the lot levied upon was her property, the sheriff, under \nsecurity of the bond furnished by the creditor Robledo, sold the said lot and \nRobledo himself purchased it; that the plaintiff was thus deprived of her \nproperty and of the rents accruing there-from from the said 28th day of January \nup to the date of the complaint, and that she had suffered considerable damage \nbecause she had missed the opportunity to sell the property for P1,200, the \nprice she had been offered for it. Counsel therefore prayed that judgment be \nrendered for the plaintiff ordering the defendants immediately to return and \ndeliver to her the said lot, together with the uncollected rents there-from, and \nto pay an indemnity of P1,200 and the costs.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the deputy sheriff of Manila alleged that his client had no \npersonal interest in the subject matter of the complaint nor in the remedies \nsought; that he only took part in the action brought by Robledo against Herrera \nfor the purpose of executing the orders of the court; that consequently he \nlevied on the said lot and its three warehouses belonging to Santiago Herrera \nand subsequently, on February 17,1913, sold them; that the lot was awarded to \nRobledo, the only bidder, for the sum of P1,000, and that the plaintiff, by an \naffidavit dated February 5, claimed the said property as the owner thereof, but, \nby reason of the bond furnished by Robledo, he, the deputy sheriff, proceeded to \nsell the property, since it was recorded in the property registry in the name of \nSantiago Herrera in August, 1901, as being free of all encumbrance and that on \nJanuary 28,1913, a record was made of the levy thereon. Said counsel therefore \nprayed that the defendant be absolved from the complaint, with the costs against \nthe plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>The other defendants, Robledo and Azarraga, alleged, among other things, that \nthe plaintiff had no legal capacity to sue and that her action was improper; \nthat, by a judgment rendered in case No. 9874, Santiago Herrera was ordered to \npay to his creditor, Miguel Robledo, the sum of M.,170, with legal interest \nthereon at the rate of six per cent per annum from September 24, 1912, and the \ncosts of the suit, and that, in executing the said judgment, the deputy sheriff \nof Manila, on January 28, 1913, levied upon the said lot, which was exclusively \nowned by the debtor Herrera, and upon all its improvements; that the first \ninscription of the aforementioned property was recorded in the property registry \nin August, 1901, in the name of Santiago Herrera, wherein it appears as being \nfree of all charge and encumbrance; that on the 28th of the said month of \nJanuary, 1913, the writ of execution on the aforementioned land which, together \nwith the three warehouses thereon, was sold at public auction and knocked down \nto the said Robledo on February 17,1913, for the sum of P1,000 Philippine \ncurrency, was recorded in the registry and the proper certificate of sale was \nissued to him by the sheriff; that the new owner, Robledo, then took possession \nof the property in good faith and was now peaceably holding the same; that the \nconveyance made to the plaintiff by Herrera and his wife Tolentino was effected \nby them with intent to defraud their creditors and could in no wise prevail as \nagainst the creditor Robledo, and that for this reason, the latter had suffered \nlosses and damages to the amount of P200. These defendants therefore prayed that \nthe plaintiff's petition be denied; that the defendants be absolved from the \ncomplaint and that the said Hermogena Santos be ordered to pajr them P200 as \nlosses and damages, and to pay the costs.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for Miguel Robledo, in a supplementary answer dated April 21, 1913, \nset forth that, subsequently to his original answer, Santiago Herrera sold and \nconveyed to him on March 24 of the same year, through a public instrument and \nfor the sum of P85, Herrera's right to redeem the property in litigation within \nthe period of one year counting from the 17th of February, 1913, the date of the \nsale of the lot at public auction; and prayed that his supplementary answer be \nadmitted in accordance with section 105 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<\/p>\n<p>After a hearing of the case and the evidence submitted by both parties, the \ncourt rendered the judgment aforementioned.<\/p>\n<p>The question raised in the claim made by the plaintiff, Hermogena Santos, is \nwhether or not the levy and sale of the lot and improvements in dispute, \neffected on petition of the creditor, Miguel Robledo, can prevail against the \nright of ownership she acquired by virtue of the gift made in her favor by the \nspouses Santiago Herrera and Basilia Tolentino.<\/p>\n<p>If the said lot and its improvements actually belonged to Hermogena Santos, \nand not to the debtor, Santiago Herrera, then it is unquestionable that the land \ncould not be levied upon for the payment of a debt of the latter that in no wise \nconcerned Hermogena Santos, as the latter was not a debtor of Miguel \nRobledo.<\/p>\n<p>The property acquired by the plaintiff in the said land is derived from the \ngift made to her by Santiago Herrera and his wife Basilia Tolentino in an \ninstrument ratified before the notary Eugenio de Lara on March 1, 1905 (Exhibit \nA). In this instrument, after reciting that the contracting parties had mutually \nagreed to live separately and to divide the conjugal partnership property \ntherein inventoried and appraised at P2,494, the said spouses state, in \nparagraph 3, that they convey to the girl Hermogena Santos the said lot with its \nwarehouse, item No. 4 of the inventory, with the express condition that the \nproceeds or rents derived from the lot and warehouse so conveyed should be \ncollected by the wife Basilia Tolentino as long as she lived. It was also \nprovided therein, among other things, that the value of the lot and its \nwarehouse should be deducted from the total value of the conjugal property which \nwas to be divided between the two spouses and which amounted to P2,200, a sum \nthat, divided equally, would amount to P1,100 each.<\/p>\n<p>According to article 618 of the Civil Code, a gift is an act of liberality by \nwhich a person disposes gratuitously of a thing in favor of another, who accepts \nit. Herrera and his wife Tolentino freely and gratuitously disposed of the said \nlot and its improvements in favor of the plaintiff; but it does not appear, \nhowever, that the latter accepted the gift in the manner provided by law.<\/p>\n<p>Article 633 of the same code prescribes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In order that a gift of real property may be valid it shall be made in a \npublic instrument, stating therein in detail the property bestowed as a gift and \nthe amount of the charges, which the donee must satisfy.<\/p>\n<p>\"The acceptance may be made in the same instrument bestowing the gift or in a \ndifferent one; but it shall produce no effect if not made during the life of the \ndonor.<\/p>\n<p>\"If made in a different instrument the acceptance shall be communicated to \nthe donor in an authentic manner, and this proceeding shall be recorded in both \ninstruments.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The said instrument (p. 21 of the record) sets out the conveyance of the lot \nby the donor spouses to the donee, but the acceptance of that gift by the \nplaintiff Santos does not appear therein and the record reveals no other \ninstrument that evidences such acceptance and notifies the donors thereof in an \nauthentic manner. Therefore, the provisions of the law not having been complied \nwith, the gift was invalid and could have no effect whatever, for the Civil Code \nprescribes, in article 629, that a gift does not bind the donor nor produce any \neffect until it has been formally accepted by the donee in accordance with law. \nBecause of this essential defect, the gift was not perfected and the donee could \nnot acquire any real and positive right in the warehouse (land) and its \nimprovements.<\/p>\n<p>So important is the donee's acceptance with the notice to the donors of his \nacceptance in order that the latter may have full force and effect, that when \nthe instrument which has been drawn up is recorded in the registry of property, \nthe document that evidences the acceptance\u2014if this has not been made in the deed \nof gift\u2014should also be recorded. And in one or both documents, as the case may \nbe, the notification of the acceptance as formally made to the donor or donors \nshould be duly set forth. These requisites, definitely prescribed by law, have \nnot been complied with, and no proof that they have appears in the record.<\/p>\n<p>Neither does it appear that Exhibit A, the instrument conveying the gift, was \nrecorded in the property registry, an essential requisite of article 23 in \nconnection with article 2 of the Mortgage Law to make it effective against third \npersons, but still supposing it were there recorded, even improperly, it could \nnot produce any legal effect, inasmuch as it does not show the donee's \nacceptance and the proper notification thereof to the donors. Therefore, with \nthese defects, even if the said instrument of gift had been recorded, it could \nnot in any way legally affect Robledo's rights.<\/p>\n<p>So, the gift in question, as specified in Exhibit A, an instrument that was \nexecuted for other purposes, to wit, conjugal separation and division of \nconjugal property between the parties, could not transmit to the donee any \npositive and effective right in the lot in litigation, to the prejudice of the \ndonors' creditor.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, on March 1,1905, when the said instrument was executed, Santiago \nHerrera had owed Miguel Robledo, from March 12, 1903, the sum of P1,170, with \ninterest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum. For the collection of this debt \nthe creditor had to bring suit against the debtor. As the record does not show \nthat the donors had reserved sufficient funds or property to satisfy the debt, \nnor that they possessed property other than the lot given away by them, we must \nconclude that the conveyance or gift made to the plaintiff by the spouses \nHerrera and Tolentino was for the purpose of defrauding the creditor, Miguel \nRobledo, by preventing him from collecting his credit.<\/p>\n<p>Article 643 of the Civil Code prescribes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Should there be no stipulation as to the payment of debts, the donee shall \nbe liable for them only if the gift has been made to defraud creditors.<\/p>\n<p>\"The gift shall always be presumed as having been made to defraud creditors \nwhen, at the time of bestowing it, the donor has not reserved to himself \nproperty sufficient to pay the debts contracted prior thereto.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Although some boats, a fishing device with nets, a light material warehouse \nerected on another's land, and the lot in litigation, are listed in the \ninventory contained in the said instrument, the fact is that when demand was \nmade upon the debtor for the payment of his debt to Robledo, he was unable to \npay it, and the said lot was levied upon and afterwards sold at public auction \nin satisfaction thereof.<\/p>\n<p>The indebtedness was contracted by Santiago Herrera in 1903, during his \nmarriage and before he and his wife gave the said lot away; consequently, its \npayment is a charge against the conjugal partnership. (Civil Code, art. \n1408.)<\/p>\n<p>Santiago Herrera was the lawful and absolute owner of the lot in litigation \nand his ownership is shown to have been recorded in the property registry of \nManila, Tondo section, first inscription, No. 1340, in August, 1901. The entry \ndiscloses that the property was then free of all charge and encumbrance and \nthat, on January 28, 1913, a note was therein made of the writ of execution \nissued against the said lot and warehouses, issued in.the proceedings instituted \nby the creditor Robledo against the debtor Herrera, the unquestionable owner of \nthe property levied upon. Moreover, the right of the judgment debtor to redeem \nthe lot in litigation was purchased by the creditor Robledo for P85 on February \n17,1913, the date of the sale of the land at public auction.<\/p>\n<p>The appellant alleges that as she was a minor, her mother, Gregoria \nTolentino, appeared before the notary to accept the said gift in the name of the \nappellant, and that since the execution of the instrument making such bestowal \nher mother has been in possession of the donated land and has been collecting \nthe rents from the tenants occupying it.<\/p>\n<p>This allegation is unfounded and cannot be sustained. The instrument Exhibit \nA does not show that the plaintiff's mother appeared or that she accepted the \nsaid gift in the name of the plaintiff. Her verbal acceptance, if made, would \nnot be sufficient, since the law requires that the acceptance shall be in \nwriting either in a separate public instrument or in the instrument whereby the \ngift is made, requirements which do not appear to have been fulfilled in the \npresent case. Neither is it true that the plaintiff was in possession and \ncollected the rents of the lot in question from the tenants who were occupying \nit.<\/p>\n<p>The strangest and most peculiar feature of this case is the testimony given \nby Santiago Herrera himself, the husband of Basilia Tolentino, these two being \nthe donors. This witness stated under oath that he identified the signature \nwhich appears at the foot of the instrument Exhibit A, although he had not read \nthis document, because he did not know how to read and was only able to write \nhis own name thereon ; that at the time the instrument was executed, the notary \nLara merely told him that the paper he was about to sign referred to the \nconjugal separation, and that Lara did not tell him that a gift of the lot was \ntherein made to Hermogena Santos; that, according to the terms of the separation \nagreed upon between himself and his wife, he conveyed to the latter his fishing \ntackle and was to keep the real estate for himself; that the said tackle was \nthen worth P300 and the lot P500; that, upon his separating from his wife on \naccount of her infidelity, he received no money from her, and denied having \nreceived any sum whatever from the hands of Eugenio de Lara; that he did not \nremember having signed the instrument relative to the apportionment of the \nproperty, the payment to him of P500 and the gift of the lot; that he identified \nhis signature at page 24 of the record, but not that on page 25; that a daughter \nof his had by his wife was still living and that it was the latter who collected \nthe rents of the said lot. The certificate of baptism of the girl Catalina, the \ndaughter of the said spouses, was exhibited at the trial (Exhibit 3, p. 40 of \nthe record). <\/p>\n<p>This testimony and the contents of the said instrument, if we except from \nthis latter the agreements relating to the conjugal separation and the division \nof the partnership property, give rise to the presumption that this instrument \nwith regard to all else therein contained was framed by the direction of the \nwoman Basilia Tolentino without the knowledge or consent of her husband, \nSantiago Herrera, especially with respect to the gift of the lot, the subject \nmatter of the claim presented by the donee.<\/p>\n<p>However, leaving aside these circumstantial details which cast doubt upon a \nlarge part of the said instrument, and restricting ourselves to the matter of \nthe gift of the lot in litigation, it is unquestionable that this gift is null \nand void in itself and can produce no effect whatever, since it fails to comply, \nwith the requirements of article 633 of the Civil Code, and because the said \ngift was made without propei1 consideration and for the purpose of defrauding \nthe defendant creditor, whom it is to be presumed the donors intended seriously \nto prejudice when bestowing the property upon the plaintiff (arts. 643 and 1297, \nCivil Code). This intended injury to the defendant would be iniquitously \nconsummated, should the plaintiff obtain a decision contrary to the judgment \nappealed from, which, moreover, is in accordance with the law and the merits of \nthe case.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, in consideration of the foregoing reasons whereby the errors \nassigned to the lower court have been refuted, the said judgment should be and \nis hereby affirmed, and the defendants are absolved from the complaint, with the \ncosts against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

In holding that the interpretation placed upon article 30 of the bank's \ncharter by the decision of the Supreme Court herein is not the law of the \ncase.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. In holding that the defendants had a right to deduct their compensation \nfrom the gross profits of the bank.<\/p>\n<p>\"3.

In holding that any of the debit items appearing in Exhibits C-1 to C-9 \nand especially the industrial and internal revenue taxes, are items that should \nbe charged against capital and not against current profits.<\/p>\n<p>\"5. In holding that it was within the power of the stockholders of the bank \nto ratify the so-called interpretation by defendants of said article \n30.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This action was commenced by the plaintiff as a shareholder of the Banco \nEspanol-Filipino for the benefit of the bank and all of the stockholders \nthereof. Its purpose is to require the defendants as former directors and \ncouncilors of the bank to refund a portion of the compensation paid to them for \ntheir services, on the ground that the amounts thereof have been wrongfully \ncomputed.<\/p>\n<p>The complaint contains three separate causes of action, of which the first \nonly is here involved. The defendants demurrer to this cause of action was \nsustained upon the ground that the facts alleged therein were not sufficient to \nentitle the plaintiff to the relief sought. Upon appeal this judgment was \nreversed and the record returned for further proceedings. (19 Phil. Rep., 82.) \nThe complaint was not thereafter amended.<\/p>\n<p>The question raised by the plaintiff in his first assignment of error \nrequires an examination of the pertinent allegations in the first cause of \naction. These allegations are as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"X. That, notwithstanding the fact that article 30 of the said by-laws \n(Exhibit B) clearly and unequivocally prescribes that the net profits of the \nsaid bank shall be apportioned as follows: Ten per cent for the board of \ndirectors, five percent for the board of managers (composed of counselors and \ntrustees) in compensation for their services as such, and the remainder, \neighty-five per cent, <em>integrally<\/em> for the shareholders of the said bank, \nthe defendants, as such members of the, said boards of directors and managers, \nrespectively, did, during each and all of the years specified, fraudulently and \nto the great detriment of the said Bank and its shareholders, and without the \nknowledge, consent or acquiescence of the latter, appropriate to themselves for \ntheir own use from the profits of the said Bank sums of money reaching an \napproximate amount of twenty thousand pesos, or a total sum of one hundred \nthousand pesos during the five years aforementioned, by deducting their said ten \nand five per cent, respectively, from the gross profits instead of deducting \nthem from the net profits of the said bank.<\/p>\n<p>\"XI. That the said defendants, during the time mentioned, carefully concealed \nin all the balances and reports of the said Bank published by them every \nindication that might give the stockholders of the said Bank the slightest \nsuspicion that the said defendants were fraudulently appropriating to themselves \nthe funds of the same; and that the plaintiff learned of such appropriation, by \na mere chance, in the month of November, 1907.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Banco Espanol-Filipino was a banking corporation which, until January \n1,1908, was controlled by the by-laws Arid regulations annexed to the complaint \nas Exhibits A and B. On November 13, 1903, the plaintiff acquired 10 shares of \nthe capital stock and has been the registered holder of these shares since that \ndate. The defendants filled, during the time mentioned in the complaint, the \noffices of director, <em>consiliario<\/em>, and <em>sindico<\/em>, and \ncollectively constituted the board of government. The only compensation to which \nthe defendants were entitled for their services is that prescribed by article 30 \nof the by-laws then in force.<\/p>\n<p>This article reads: \"Of the profits or gains which may result from the bank's \noperations, after deducting all the expenses of its administration and the part, \nif any, which corresponds to the legal reserve fund, there shall be set apart \nten per cent for the directorate and five per cent for the board of government, \nthe distribution of which shall be made as provided in the regulations. The \neighty-five per cent remaining shall belong integrally to the shareholders pro \nrata the number of shares owned by each.\"<\/p>\n<p>Since the date on which the plaintiff acquired his shares, the earnings of \neach half-year of the bank have been liquidated in the manner set forth in the \nExhibits C-1 to C-9, inclusive, attached to the agreed statement of facts, and \nthe respective defendants have individually collected for their services the \nsums specified in Exhibit D.<\/p>\n<p>Under date of November 15, 1907, the plaintiff addressed to the defendants a \nletter alleging that the earnings of the bank had not been apportioned in \naccordance with the provisions of article 30, <em>supra<\/em>, and making demand \nupon them for the refund to the bank of a portion of the amounts received by \nthem in compensation for their services. The defendants refused to comply with \nthis demand and on December 7, 1907, the plaintiff commenced an action seeking \nthe same relief herein prayed for. This action was dis missed, and on December \n21, 1907, the shareholders of the bank were convened in a special meeting \"for \nthe express purpose of discussing and taking action relative to the alleged \ninterpretation of article 30 of the by-laws.\" At this shareholders' meeting \nthere were present, either in person or by proxy, 183 persons and entities, \nholding 6,499 shares of the total issue of 7,500. Among those present at this \nmeeting was plaintiff's attorney. The plaintiff's letter, referred to above, was \nread, as was the complaint which the plaintiff had previously filed, and, after \na discussion in which the appellant's attorney took part, a resolution was \nadopted ratifying and approving the distribution of the bank's earnings as made, \nand authorizing the defendants to proceed in the same manner with the earnings \nof the latter half of the year 1907. In favor of this resolution there was a \ntotal of 555 votes, representing 5,550 shares. Soon thereafter the present \naction was commenced.<\/p>\n<p>As will be seen from the plaintiff's first assignment of error and the \nargument of counsel relating thereto, it is strongly urged that inquiry \nrespecting the interpretation and application of article 30, <em>supra<\/em>, has \nbeen closed by the decision of this court rendered upon the demurrer of the \ndefendants to the complaint. Under the doctrine of <em>stare decisis<\/em> the \nplaintiff insists that \"the law of the case\" has been established and that it \nhas been necessarily decided that the remuneration received by tne defendants \nfor their services was not in accordance with article 30.<\/p>\n<p>The decision relied upon by the plaintiff is that of Pascual <em>vs.<\/em> Del \nSaz Orozco (19 Phil.Rep.,82). \"The law of the case,\" established by that \ndecision, is the law of the case which was before the court and which the court \nthereby decided.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff, as will be seen from paragraphs 10 and 11, above quoted, whose \nsufficiency was then and there under consideration, alleged that the defendants, \nin violation of article 30, had<em> fraudulently misappropriated<\/em> to \nthemselves certain funds of the bank by computing their percentages upon the \ngross earnings of the bank and, by a series of fraudulent concealments, had \nwitheld the knowledge thereof from the shareholders. The demurrer admitted the \nfacts as alleged and raised the question of the right of the plaintiff to \nrecover upon those facts. The ruling of the lower court was to the effect that, \neven assuming the facts to be as alleged in the complaint, the plaintiff had no \nright of action. On appeal the Supreme Court considered this very question and \nnecessarily none other, which relates to the point now under consideration, and, \nin reversing the ruling of the lower court, decided that, assuming the facts to \nbe as alleged in the complaint, the plaintiff did have a cause of action. If \nthese were the facts o\u00a3 the case now under consideration, there would be neither \noccasion nor opportunity to further discuss the law applicable thereto. But the \ncase which the present appeal presents is not that case at all. Since that \ndecision was rendered the case has been tried and the facts now before the court \nfor consideration are not the allegations that the defendants fraudulently \nmisappropriated to themselves certain funds of the bank, and by a series of \nconcealments withheld the knowledge thereof from the shareholders, but the real \nfacts as they have been stipulated in the agreed statement. These facts are that \nthe defendants did not, as alleged, fraudulently misappropriate certain funds of \nthe bank by computing their percentages upon the gross earnings, but did first \ndeduct the expenses of administration, and that none of the acts of the \ndefendants were tainted in any way with fraud.<\/p>\n<p>In this particular the case now under consideration is clearly differentiated \nand distinguished from the former case. In that case the court decided that the \ndefendants may not fraudulently compute their percentages upon the gross \nearnings, and that a complaint which alleges that they have done so states a \ncause of action. This was the question submitted and decided. The question \nsubmitted upon the present appeal is whether the computation really made is in \naccordance with article 30. This holding is not in conflict with the rule \nannounced in the cases cited and relied upon by counsel for the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>For example, in the case of Heidt <em>vs.<\/em> Minor (113 Cal, 385), the \ncourt said: \"Moreover, the rule of the law of the case only applies when, on a \nsubsequent trial, the issues and the facts found remain substantially the \nsame.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Forgerson et al. <em>vs.<\/em> Smith (104 Ind., 246), the court \nlaid down this rule: \"But where the questions are necessarily involved, * * * \nthe judgment on appeal rules the case throughout all its subsequent stages. The \ndecision is an adjudication concluding the courts and the parties. It is not, of \ncourse, conclusive as to other cases, but it is conclusive as to the questions \nin judgment in the case in which it was rendered, upon the parties and those in \nprivity with them. * * * We regard, the former decision as adjudicating all of \nthe controlling questions in the case, for it was not possible to reach the \nconclusion there announced without deciding that the property in the promissory \nnotes in controversy was in the administrator of the estate of Mahala Shaw \ndeceased.\"<\/p>\n<p>In Standard Sewing Machine Co. <em>vs.<\/em> Leslie (118 Fed., 557), the court \nused this language: \"It is a familiar and entirely righteous rule that a court \nof review is precluded from agitating the questions that were made, considered, \nand 'decided on previous reviews. The former decision furnishes 'the law of the \ncase' not only to the tribunal to which the cause is remanded, but to the \nappellate tribunal itself on a subsequent writ or appeal.\"<\/p>\n<p>Now, has the remuneration of the defendants for their services been computed \nin accordance with article 30 of the by-laws?<\/p>\n<p>The item of \"profit and loss\" for each half year, during the entire period \ncovered by the complaint, was made up by crediting to it all the items of net \nprofits produced by the various accounts of the bank, including the accounts of \ncurrent debtors, the profits from exchange, the profits in the sale of money, \nthe profits from the discount of bills and notes, the net proceeds from the real \nproperties of the bank after the payment of all the expenses thereof, including \ntaxes, insurance, and repairs, and all other net profits obtained by the bank. \nTo the debit of this \"profit and loss\" account were entered all sums paid out by \nthe bank as interest upon fixed deposits or credit balances of current accounts. \nThe item of \"general expenses\" included salaries, light, water, stationery, \nstamps, attorneys' fees, and all other .items of general expenses incurred \neither by the main office in Manila or by the branch office in Iloilo. In short, \nit appears that every expenditure of whatever nature made from the funds of the \nbank, with the exception of the industrial tax (later internal-revenue tax) and \namounts set off against bad accounts, was included in the item of \"general \nexpenses,\" or, what amounted to the same thing, deducted from the \"profit and \nloss\" account before computing the remuneration received by the respective \ndefendants for their services. Upon this point it might be well to set out in \nfull Exhibit C-1. (Exhibits C-2 to C-9, inclusive, were made up in the same \nmanner.)

From the various Exhibits, C-1 to C-9, inclusive, it is apparent \nthat nothing whatever was applied to this legal reserve fund, and, as the \ncorrectness of these exhibits is not disputed, it is also apparent that nothing \nwas due this fund at any time during the period covered by the complaint. \nUnless, therefore, the items of industrial tax (later internal-revenue tax) and \nthe amounts set aside to cover bad debts may be deemed \"expenses of \nadministration,\" it is clear that there is no merit in the plaintiff's \ncontention.<\/p>\n<p>At the outset it may be said that the proper disposition of this case is \nrendered difficult by the inaccurate language used in article 30. This article \nprovides for a percentage of the profits (utilidades y ganancias), and it may be \nat once said that these are not necessarily <em>net<\/em> profits, as claimed by \ncounsel for the plaintiff. Profits may be either gross profits or net profits, \nand there are innumerable methods of computing each of these. Likewise, \n\"expenses of administration\" may or may not include all amounts expended in the \nconduct of business. Indeed, it is somewhat unusual that a provision of the \nbank's charter, so difficult of exact definition, should be so lacking in \nprecision. Hardly less unusual, from an American point of view, is the \nincorporation into the bank's charter of the measure of remuneration of the \nboard of government. This, in America, has generally been considered a detail in \nthe internal management of a corporation to be controlled by the shareholders \nthemselves, Who, in many instances, even delegate to the directors the power of \nfixing their own salaries.<\/p>\n<p>The remuneration received by the defendants is not even alleged to be \nexcessive. The two active managers of the bank received, during the period in \nquestion, sums amounting to approximately P15,000 per year, while the other \ndefendants, not participating in the active management of the corporation, \nreceived sums amounting in no instance to a salary of P2,500 per year. All of \nthe defendants received, during the four and a half years, P201,825.81, or an \napproximate yearly average of P45,000 per year. Bearing in mind the magnitude of \nthe business and the fact that the bank prospered under the management of the \ndefendants, there is no wonder that no claim is made of excessive compensation. \nDuring all these years the plaintiff, as well as the other shareholders of the \nbank, remained silent, apparently content with the increased prosperity of the \nbusiness, although at the end of each fiscal year they had the opportunity to \nexamine the books of the bank and inform themselves of the method by which the \ndefendants computed their compensation. And, furthermore, an extraordinary \nmeeting of the shareholders was duly convened on December 21,1907, for the \nexpress purpose, as we have indicated, of discussing the interpretation placed \nupon article 30 by the defendants.<\/p>\n<p>The industrial tax, which the appellant insists should be first deducted from \nthe earnings before computing the percentages, was fixed by law at 5 per cent of \nthe dividends distributed among the shareholders of the bank. In order to make \nthe deduction of this tax, its amount must first be a known quantity. Since its \namount is a percentage of the dividends, the amount of the latter must likewise \nbe a known quantity before the operation can be made. The amount available as \ndividends is dependent upon the amount due and payable out of the profits to the \ndefendants for their services. Therefore, this amount due the defendants from \nthe profits must be known before the amount remaining for dividends can be \nfixed. For example, if the remaining earnings, after deducting from the gross \nearnings the general expenses, is the sum of P58,000, how much is to be deducted \ntherefrom as internal-revenue tax before computing the percentage of the \ndefendants? The law said that the amount of this tax should be 5 per cent of the \ndividends distributed. The amount to be distributed depends upon how much may be \nleft after the remuneration of the defendants is paid. It is no reply to this \nargument to point out that the total profits may be or are usually sufficiently \ngreat to permit a declaration of the maximum dividend of P60,000 and that in \nsuch cases it is a simple matter to compute 5 per cent of P60,000, for the rule \nof computation, established by article 30, is a general one, applicable alike in \nall cases, whether the earnings of the bank be great or1 small. This article \ndoes not establish two rules of computations, one which is only feasible or \npracticable when the earnings are sufficiently large to warrant a dividend in \nthe maximum amount and another and different rule when the dividend falls below \nthat amount.<\/p>\n<p>Again, in our opinion the nature of the old industrial tax negatives the idea \nthat it is one of the items of \"expenses of administration\" referred to in \narticle 30. This tax was levied by law, not upon the earnings or profits of the \nbank, but only upon such earnings or profits as were actually distributed among \nthe shareholders as dividends. It was purely a dividend tax, collected for \nconvenience in a lump sum from the company, but levied solely and exclusively \nupon the distributed dividends. To deduct this tax from the amount upon which \nthe remuneration of the defendants was computed would have made the defendants \ncontributors to the tax levied upon the company-shareholders. Article 30 does \nnot require the defendants as employees of the bank to contribute to the payment \nof the bank's taxes. The discrimination made by article 30 between \"expenses of \nadministration\" and other disbursements is reasonable and in accordance with the \nprinciples of the contract which existed between the bank and the defendants. \nThat was a contract of employment in which one of the contracting parties agreed \nto supply the capital and the other his services, and to divide in a stipulated \nproportion the proceeds of the application of the services of the one to the \ncapital of the other. Since it was incumbent upon the bank to furnish the \ncapital, so it was incumbent upon it to maintain the same. Any tax which tended \ndirectly to impair the amount of the capital should consequently have been paid \nby the hirer of the services and not by the servant. There could be no real \ndifference in principle between the failure to furnish the capital in the first \nplace and the failure to replace any part of it which disappears by reason of a \ntax levied thereon. We, therefore, conclude that the method employed by the \ndefendants for the liquidation of the bank's business, in so far as the \nindustrial tax (internal-revenue tax) is concerned, was strictly in accordance \nwith article 30 of the by-laws.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">DEDUCTION OF AMOUNTS TO COVER BAD ACCOUNTS.<\/p>\n<p>When the defendant Orozco took over the management of the bank, he reported \nto the board of directors its financial situation, embracing among other things \na loss from bad accounts for the past of over P500,000. It probably would have \nbeen possible to cover this entire amount of losses from funds in the reserve, \nexisting for just such purposes, but to have done so would have left the bank \nwithout a present reserve. It was decided to preserve the reserve fund intact, \nand carry the bad accounts as accounts in suspense until the same could be \ngradually and conveniently wiped out. Consequently, in each half yearly \nliquidation the dividends distributed to the shareholders were strictly limited \nto 4 per cent per semester, and the earnings after payment of the expenses of \nadministration, the remuneration of defendants, the taxes, and the said \ndividends were applied pro tanto to the extinction of the bad accounts held in \nsuspense. It does not clearly appear whether these funds, which were used for \nthat purpose, first went into the voluntary reserve fund and were then applied \nto the extinction of the bad accounts in suspense or were applied directly by \nthe semiannual liquidations from the profit and loss accounts. The process \nfollowed is immaterial since the result must be the same. The important fact is \nthat in each semester there was an excess of net profits over and above the 4 \nper cent provided in article 31 of the by laws. This excess of net profits was \ndivisible under that article, one-half to the shareholders and one-half to the \nlegal reserve, voluntary reserve, or additional dividends as the case might be. \nInstead, the entire excess of net profits went to extinguish bad accounts whose \nextinction would have exhausted the reserve fund and required its replenishment. \nTo the extent that one-half of the excess of net profits were not distributed as \ndividends, but were put to the purposes of reserve, the shareholders made a \nsacrifice for their own welfare. Whether this was valicjly done or not is of no \nimportance at this time for the reason that the remuneration of the defendants \nwas not affected in any way thereby. As to the remaining half of the excess net \nprofits, the application made was in direct accord with the by-laws, since the \napplication of the funds to the purposes of the .reserve fund is exactly the \nsame as if the reserve fund had been employed for the purpose and then \nreplenished by these funds.<\/p>\n<p>According to article 30, the net profits belonged to the shareholders. \nAccording to article 31, these net profits, belonging to the shareholders, \nshould be partially divided among them and partially kept intact in the bank, \naccording to the amount thereof, to the status of the legal reserve, and to the \nwishes of the board of government respecting a voluntary reserve. From the fact \nthat part of the net profits was preserved intact in the bank as part of either \nthe legal or voluntary reserve, it cannot be said that such portion of the net \nprofits had ceased to belong to the share holders. These excess net profits are, \nin a sense, still in the bank and still belong to the shareholders within the \nmeaning of article 30. To hold that the bad accounts of the bank should have \nbeen extinguished by the gross earnings instead of the net profits, would, in \neffect, compel the defendants, as employees, to contribute to the replenishing \nof the depleted reserves of the bank.<\/p>\n<p>It would be wholly unjust to include under \"expenses of administration\" \nduring the time the defendants were in charge, the losses previously sustained \nby the defendants' predecessors in office. These defendants were in no wise \nconnected with the bank nor were they in any way responsible for those losses. \nTo interpret article 30 so would result in the incoming manager becoming an heir \nto an insolvent inheritance. Under such conditions no one would be found to \naccept the office and the bank would have to cease its operations.<\/p>\n<p>As to the responsibility of the defendants for the losses which occurred \nduring the period covered by the complaint, it might be said in the first place \nthat the greater part of these losses constitutes the third cause of action of \nappellant's complaint and was made the subject of a separate appeal to this \ncourt. In the second place, it has not been shown that any part of such losses \nwere written off as bad debts during the period of time in question. And it is \nupon this fact that we rest our holding on this point. Therefore, we are not now \ncalled upon to decide whether the defendants could have treated these losses in \nthe same manner as they did those occurring prior to December 31, 1905. <\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from was affirmed.1 In this opinion it has been our \nintention to set forth at some length our reasons for affirming this judgment at \nthe close of the last session.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

R. Brown is a district engineer in the Province \nof Rizal and that he is about to destroy and remove the ancient monuments which \nmark the limits of the municipality of Binangonan, Province of Rizal, and is now \nabout to construct new monuments in place of the old, but locating them in such \nmanner that the barrios above named will be excluded from the territorial limits \nof Cardona and included within those of Binangonan. <\/p>\n<p>The plaintiffs further allege that the power of organizing municipalities and \nof fixing their territorial limits resides exclusively in the Legislature, \nhaving been placed there by the Philippine Bill, and that the Legislature has \nnot passed any law or given any authorization to any corporation or person to \nseparate said barrios from the municipality of Cardona and incorporate them in \nthat of Binangonan; that the only authority which the said municipality of \nBinangonan and the said engineer assert for the changing of the limits of the \nsaid municipalities is an Executive Order, No. 66, series of 1914, issued by the \nGovernor-General of the Philippine Islands, authorizing and directing that said \nlimits be changed in the manner in which the defendants are now attempting to \nchange them.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiffs further allege that the Philippine Bill does not authorize the \nGovernor-General or the Legislature to delegate to any person or corporation the \npower to change the territorial limits of municipalities and that Act No. 1748, \nunder which the said executive order was issued, is, therefore, \nunconstitutional, the Legislature having in that Act attempted to delegate its \npower to the Governor-General of the Islands; that said executive order is, in \neffect, an amendment and repeal of the general laws of the Islands organizing \nprovinces and municipalities and fixing their respective limits, and is, \ntherefore, void and of no effect.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiffs further allege that, aside from being violative of the \nPhilippine Bill, said order does not comply with Act No. 1748 referred to \nbecause it does not affirmatively set forth that it is made for the public \nbenefit, as required by section 1 of said Act. <\/p>\n<p>Upon these allegations plaintiffs pray \"that judgment be rendered in their \nfavor declaring the municipality of Binangonan an illegal usurper of the powers, \nfaculties, and duties of the municipality of Cardona with respect to the barrios \nof Tatala, Balatik, Nambug, Tutulo, Mahabang Parang, Nagsulo, Sampad, and Bonot; \nand that the court issue, pending trial, a preliminary injunction against the \ndefendant L. R. Brown, district engineer of the Province of Rizal, ordering him \nto abstain until the further order of this court from destroying the ancient \nmonuments which mark the municipal limits of Binangonan and Cardona and \nconstructing others in their stead.\"<\/p>\n<p>The complaint is signed by Modesto Reyes and Eliseo Ymzon, \"attorneys for the \nmunicipality of Cardona.\" As showing their authority to appear for the \nGovernment of the Philippine Islands, which is also a nominal plaintiff, the \nplaintiffs in this case allege \"that on the 19th of August, 1914, the \nundersigned, in the name and representation of the municipality of Cardona, \ndirected a communication to the Honorable Attorney-General asking him to begin \nthe presentaction of quo warranto, but that said Honorable Attorney-General \nrefused and still refuses to do so.\"<\/p>\n<p>The only point which we undertake at this moment to decide is whether or not \nthe plaintiff is entitled to a preliminary injunction upon the facts stated.<\/p>\n<p>Under section 166 of the Code of Civil Procedure one of the conditions \nprecedent to the issuance of a preliminary injunction is that \"the complaint \nmust show facts entitling the plaintiff to the relief demanded,\" that \"the \ncomplaint must be verified by the oath of the plaintiff or by that of some other \nperson by him duly authorized and who can testify to the truth of the facts set \nforth in the complaint,\" and that \"the plaintiff must file with the clerk of the \ncourt in which the action is pending a written obligation on the part of the \nplaintiff, with sufficient sureties, to the effect that the plaintiff will pay \nto the party enjoined all such damages as such party may sustain by reason of \nthe injunction, if the court should finally decide that the plaintiff was not \nentitled thereto.\" It is provided by section 164 of said code that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A preliminary injunction may be granted when it is established, in the \nmanner hereinafter provided, to the satisfaction of the judge granting it:<\/p>\n<p>\"1. That the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded and such relief, or \nany part thereof, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the \nacts complained of either for a limited period or perpetually;<\/p>\n<p>\"2. That the commission or continuance of some act complained of during the \nlitigation would probably work injustice to the plaintiff;<\/p>\n<p>\"3. That the defendant is doing, or threatens, or is about to do, or is \nprocuring or suffering to be done, some act probably in violation of the \nplaintiff's rights, respecting the subject of the action, and tending to render \nthe judgment ineffectual.'<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A simple reading of the complaint and the record will demonstrate that the \nplaintiffs have not met the requirements of these sections. While we do not \nexamine into the sufficiency of the complaint where no preliminary relief is \nprayed for, leaving that matter to be brought to our attention by the defendant, \nwe do take into consideration the sufficiency of the complaint in respect of the \nremedy prayed for when we are asked to issue a preliminary injunction. The Code \nof Civil Procedure, as we have seen, expressly lays that duty upon us; and, \nunder said code, we are not permitted to issue a preliminary injunction unless \nthe facts set out in the complaint show that the plaintiff is entitled to the \nrelief prayed for, and it appears that all the other requirements named in the \ncode are fully complied with.<\/p>\n<p>This action is not properly one of quo warranto and the court has no \nauthority under the facts stated to \"declare the municipality of Binangonan an \nillegal usurper of the powers, faculties, and duties of the municipality of \nCardona with respect to the barrios of Tatala, Balatik, Nambug, Tutulo, Mahabang \nParang, Nagsulo, Sampad, and Bonot.\" The facts alleged do not bring the case \nwithin the provisions of section 197 and following sections of the Code of Civil \nProcedure which deal with the action of quo warranto. It is not a case where a \nperson has usurped, intruded into, or unlawfully holds or exercises a public \ncivil office or a franchise within the Philippine Islands, or an office in a \ncorporation created by the authority of the Government of the Philippine \nIslands, or a case where a public civil official commits or suffers an act which \nby the provisions of law works a forfeiture of his office, or where a body of \npersons act as a corporation within the Philippine Islands without being legally \nincorporated or without lawful authority so to act. The action is not against a \ncorporation founded upon the fact that it has offended against a provision of. a \nstatute relative to its creation or renewal, or which alters or amends the same, \nthat it has forfeited its privileges and franchise by nonuser, or has committed \nan act which amounts to a surrender of its corporate rights, privileges, or \nfranchise, or that it has misused a franchise, privilege, or right conferred \nupon it by law, or that it has exercised a franchise, privilege, or right in \ncontravention of law, The case at bar seems to be, so far as the allegations of \nthe complaint are concerned, an attempt on the part of the defendants to move \nthe boundary lines between two municipalities in such a way as apparently to \nincrease the territory of one and decrease that of the other. If this attempt is \nillegal, then an action permanently to restrain the effort would perhaps be one \nof the remedies which plaintiff might invoke; but the action of quo warranto is \nwholly unfitted to meet the exigencies of the case set forth. It relates solely \nto persons who usurp, intrude into, or unlawfully hold or exercise a public \noffice or who do or suffer an act which by the provisions of law works a \nforfeiture of their office. In other words, it applies exclusively to persons \nwho have no title to the office which they pretend to hold and the functions \nwhich they assume to exercise. It does not apply to persons who, having a legal \ntitle to an office, exercise the functions of that office beyond their proper \nlimits or exceed the power and jurisdiction which is conferred upon that office \nby law. In the case before us no allegation of usurpation is made which is \nsupported by any fact stated in the petition.<\/p>\n<p>While the action of quo warranto may also be begun against corporations, it \nis upon the same terms and for the same reasons which authorize it against \npersons. The corporation must act without being legally incorporated or it must \nhave on ended against some provision of law in such a manner as to forfeit its \nprivileges and franchise, or it must have surrendered its corporate rights, \nprivileges, or franchise. In a word, before the action can be begun against \neither a person or a corporation, it must appear that such person or corporation \nhas no title to the office the functions of which he or it seeks to \nexercise.<\/p>\n<p>While the defendant municipality may not have legal authority to exercise \njurisdiction over the barrios named in the complaint as having been transferred \nfrom the plaintiff to the defendant municipality, it is nevertheless admitted \nthat it is a municipal corporation with the power and authority to exercise \nmunicipal prerogatives. The fact that it may have attempted to exercise \njurisdiction over a strip of territory beyond its limits will not warrant an \naction of quo warranto, which, under the code, is founded upon the usurpation of \nan office or franchise.<\/p>\n<p>The motion for a preliminary injunction is denied.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

We find \nalso, upon an examination of the record, that almost exactly the same petition, \nword for word, even including the interlineations and misspelling, had \ntheretofore been presented in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, \non the 24th day of September, 1912. The record shows that upon the presentation \nof the first cause in the Court of First Instance (No. 9949), an order was \nissued to the Insular Collector of Customs to show why the1 prayer of said \npetitioners should not be granted. To that order, the Acting Insular Collector \nof Customs made answer, setting forth a correct copy of all the proceedings \nrelating to said petition, which had been had in the department of customs.<\/p>\n<p>Upon the record thus made and the issues presented therein, the Honorable A. \nS. Crossfield, judge, found that the Insular Collector of Customs was legally \ndetaining the bodies of the said petitioners, and denied the writ of habeas \ncorpus. From that judgment, the petitioners appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>The \nrecord in that cause was received in the office of the clerk of the Supreme \nCourt on the 30th day of January, 1913. Said cause was not given a number in the \nSupreme Court, for the reason that the appellants never paid the registration \nfee. On the 31st day of January, Idl3, the attorneys for the appellants were \nnotified and requested to pay the filing fee necessary for the registration of \nsaid cause. The appellants apparently paid no attention whatever to said notice. \nOn the 29th day of October, 1913, the Supreme Court dictated an order, directed \nto the attorneys for the plaintiffs and appellants, requiring them, within a \nperiod of ten days after notice, to pay to the clerk the sum of P24, as the \nregistration fee. Said order further provided that in case they should fail to \npay such registration fee, the court would consider that they had abandoned \ntheir appeal and that the same would be dismissed and the case returned to the \nlower court for execution. A copy of said order was actually received by the \nattorneys* for the appellants, as more fully appears by the certificate of the \nsheriff of the city of Manila, on the 11th day of November, 1913. So far as the \nrecord shows, the appellants paid no attention to the foregoing order of the \ncourt.<\/p>\n<p>The appellants having failed to comply with the foregoing order, the Supreme \nCourt, on the 15th day of December, 1913, dictated a further order, dismissing \nsaid appeal. In accordance with said order a final judgment was rendered in said \ncause and the record returned to the Court of First Instance upon the 17th day \nof December, 1913.<\/p>\n<p>Nearly two months after final judgment had been rendered in said cause (No. \n9949) and after the same had been returned to the lower court for execution, the \nplaintiffs, on the 11th day of February, 1914, presented the petition in the \npresent cause, which, as was said above, is exactly the same, word for word, \neven to the interlineations and misspelling, as that presented in cause No. \n9949.<\/p>\n<p>On the 13th day of February, 1914, Mr. Beaumont appearing for the petitioners \nand Mr. Gerkin for the respondent, they entered into the following \nagreement:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"1. That the question raised in the present case has already been submitted \nto the Third Branch by the same interested parties, in case No. 9949, and \ndecided by Judge Crossfield adversely to the claims of the appellant.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. That when the judgment was appealed from to the Supreme Court of these \nIslands, the appeal was vacated in said court through failure to pay the legal \nfees.<\/p>\n<p>\"3. That the interested party, through his counsel, again raises in this \ncourt the same question that was decided in the First Branch, so that he may \nhave the opportunity to appeal from whatever judgment is rendered.<\/p>\n<p>\"4. That by common agreement they submit the same proceedings had in the \nThird Branch as evidence in the present case.<\/p>\n<p>\"5. That counsel for the Collector of Customs submits the same reply that is \nalready on record in case No. 9949, so that it be considered in the present case \nas the answer therein.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On the issues thus presented by the petition, the said agreement and the \nrecord made in said cause No. 9949, the case was submitted to the Honorable \nSimplicio del Rosario, judge, who, after setting forth the said agreement, \nrendered a decision, the dispositive part of which is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The petition now presented by the same interested party having been decided \nagainst him by the judge presiding in the Third Branch and the facts submitted \nby the petitioner not having changed.<\/p>\n<p>\"The writ of habeas corpus sought is denied, with the costs against the \npetitioner.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From that judgment the petitioners appealed to this court and made a number \nof assignments of error, all relating to the authority and conduct of the \ncustoms authorities in passing upon the right of the petitioners to enter the \nPhilippine Islands.<\/p>\n<p>It is difficult to understand upon what theory the attorneys for the \npetitioners, after a final judgment had been rendered against their clients, can \njustify the presentation of the same questions again in a new action, without \neven alleging or indicating the existence of new questions or facts which had \narisen subsequently. A final judgment in a habeas corpus proceeding is just as \nbinding upon the parties as a final judgment in any other proceeding. The \nparties have no more right to relitigate the same questions inv habeas corpus \nproceeding than they have in an ordinary action. A final judgment in such \nactions concludes further proceedings just as effectually as it does in other \nproceedings.<\/p>\n<p>A judgment which has been rendered in proceedings regularly conducted, when \nthe same is not tainted with fraud, can not be disregarded or set aside, except \nand until, in some legal proceeding brought for that purpose, it has been \nnullified. In the present case no intimation is made in the record or no \nsuggestion presented that the final judgment was illegal for any reason. No hint \nis made even that it should be set aside or annulled. Its existence and finality \nare admitted by the petitioners.

GREGORIO YULO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\"><!--.;<br-->This suit is brought for the recovery of a certain sum of money, the balance of a current account opened by the firm of Inchausti &amp; Company with Teodoro Yulo and after his death continued with his widow and children, whose principal representative is\u00a0 Gregorio\u00a0 Yulo.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Teodoro\u00a0 Yulo,\u00a0 a property owner of Iloilo, for the exploitation and cultivation of his numerous haciendas in the province of Occidental Negros, had been borrowing money from the firm of Inchausti &amp; Company under specific conditions. On April 9, 1903, Teodoro Yulo died testate and for the execution of the provisions of his will he had appointed as administrators his widow and five of his sons, Gregorio Yulo being one of the latter. He thus left a widow, Gregoria Regalado, who died on October 22d of the following year, 1904, there remaining of the marriage the following legitimate children: Pedro, Francisco, Teodoro, Manuel, Gregorio, Mariano, Carmen, Concepcion, and Jose Yulo y Regalado. Of these children Concepcion and Jose were minors, while Teodoro was mentally incompetent. At the death of their predecessor in interest, Teodoro Yulo, his widow and children held the conjugal property in common and at the death of this said widow, Gregoria Regalado, these children preserved the same relations under the name of Hijos de T. Yulo continuing their current account with Inchausti &amp; Company in the best and most harmonious reciprocity until said balance amounted to two hundred thousand pesos. In this state of affairs the creditor firm tried to obtain security for the payment of the disbursements of money which until that time it had been making in favor of its debtors, the Yulos.<br\/><br\/>First. Gregorio Yulo, for himself and in representation of his brothers Pedro, Francisco, Manuel, Mariano, and Carmen, executed on June 26, 1908, a notarial document (Exhibit S) whereby all admitted their indebtedness to Inchausti &amp; Company in the sum of P203,221.27 and, in order to secure the same with interest thereon at 10 per cent per annum, they especially mortgaged an undivided six-ninth of their thirty-eight rural properties, their remaining urban properties, lorchas, and family credits which were listed, obligating themselves to make a formal inventory and to describe in due form all the said properties, as well as to cure all the defects which might prevent the inscription of the said instrument in the registry of property and finally to extend by the necessary formalities the aforesaid mortgage over the remaining three-ninths part of all the property and rights belonging to their other brothers, the incompetent Teodoro, and the minors Concepcion and Jose.<br\/><br\/>Second. On January 11, 1909, Gregorio yulo in representation of Hijos de T. Yulo answered a letter of the firm of Inchausti &amp; Company in these terms: \"With your favor of the 2d inst. we have received an abstract of our current account with your important firm, closed on the 31st of last December, with which we desire to express our entire conformity as also with the balance in your favor of P271.863.12.\" On July 17, 1909, Inchausti &amp; Company informed Hijos de T. Yulo of the reduction of the said balance to P253,445.42, with which balance Hijos de T, Yulo expressed its conformity by means of a letter of the 19th of the same month and year. Regarding this conformity a new document evidencing the mortgage credit was formalized.<br\/><br\/>Third. On August 12, 1909, Gregorio Yulo, for himself and in representation of his brother Manuel Yulo, and in their own behalf Pedro Yulo, Francisco Yulo, Carmen Yulo, and Concepcion Yulo, the latter being of age at the time, executed the notarial instrument (Exhibit X). Through this, the said persons, including Concepcion Yulo, ratified all the contents of the prior document of June 26, 1908, severally and jointly acknowledged and admitted their indebtedness to Inchausti &amp; Company for the net amount of two hundred fifty-three thousand four hundred forty-five pesos and forty-two centavos (P253,445.42) which they obligated themselves to pay, with interest at ten per cent per annum, in five installments at the\u00a0 rate of\u00a0 fifty thousand\u00a0 pesos (P50,000), except the last, this being fifty-three thousand four hundred forty-five pesos and forty-two centavos (P53,445.42), beginning June 30, 1910, continuing successively on the 30th of each June until the last payment on June 30, 1914. Among other clauses, they expressly stipulated the following:<br\/><blockquote> \"Fifth. The default in payment of any of the installments established in clause 3, or the noncompliance of any of the other obligations which by the present document and that of June 26, 1908, we, the Yulos, brothers and sisters, have assumed, will result in the maturity of all the said installments, and as a consequence thereof, if they so deem expedient Messrs. Inchausti &amp; Company may exercise at once all the rights and actions which to them appertain in order to obtain the immediate and total payment of our debt, in the same manner that they would have so done at the maturity of the said installments.\" <br\/>\u00a0<br\/>\"Fifteenth. All the obligations which by this, as well as by the document of June 26, 1908, concern us, will be understood as having been contracted in solidum by all of us, the Yulos, brothers and sisters.<br\/><br\/>\"Sixteenth. It is also agreed that this instrument shall be confirmed and ratified in all its parts, within the present week, by our brother Don Mariano Yulo y Kegalado who resides in Bacolod, otherwise it will not be binding on Messrs. Inchausti &amp; Company who can make use of their rights to demand and obtain the immediate payment of their credit without any further extension or delay, in accordance with what we have agreed.\"<\/blockquote>Fourth. This instrument was neither ratified nor confirmed by Mariano Yulo.<br\/><br\/>Fifth. The Yulos, brothers and sisters, who executed the preceding instrument, did not pay the first installment of the obligation.<br\/><br\/>Sixth. Therefore, on March 27, 1911, Inchausti &amp; Company brought an ordinary action in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, against Gregorio Yulo for the payment of the said balance due of two hundred fifty-three thousand, four hundred forty-five pesos and forty-two centavos (P253,445.42) with interest at ten per cent per annum, on that date aggregating forty-two thousand, nine hundred forty-four pesos and seventy-six centavos\u00a0 (P42,944.76).<br\/><br\/>Seventh. But, on May 12, 1911, Francisco, Manuel, and Carmen Yulo y Regalado executed in favor of Inchausti &amp; Company\u00a0 another notarial instrument in recognition of the debt and the obligation of payment in the following terms: \"First, the debt is reduced for them to two hundred twenty-five thousand pesos (P225,000) ; second, the interest is likewise reduced for them to 6 per cent per annum, from March 15, 1911; third, the installments are increased to eight, the first of P20,000, beginning on June 30, 1911, and the rest of P30,000 each on the same date of each successive year until the total obligation shall be finally and satisfactorily paid on June 30, 1919,\" it being expressly agreed \"that if any of the partial payments specified in the foregoing clause be not paid at its maturity, the amount of the said partial payment together with its interest shall bear interest at the rate of 15 per cent per annum from the date of said maturity, without the necessity of demand until its complete payment;\" that \"if during two consecutive years the partial payments agreed upon be not made, they shall lose the right to make use of the period granted to them for the payment of the debt or the part thereof which remains unpaid, and that Messrs. Inehausti &amp; Company may consider the total obligation due and demandable, and proceed to collect the same together with the interest for the delay above stipulated through all legal means.\" (4th clause.)<br\/><br\/>Thus was it stipulated between Inehausti &amp; Company and the said three Yulos, brothers and sisters\u2014by way of compromise so that Inehausti &amp; Company might, as it did, withdraw the claims pending in the special proceedings for the probate of the will of Don Teodoro Yulo and of the intestacy of Dona Gregoria Regalado\u2014stipulating expressly however in the sixth clause that \"Inehausti &amp; Company should include in their suit brought in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo against Don Gregorio Yulo, his brother and joint coobligee, Don Pedro Yulo, and they will procure by all legal means and in the least time possible a judgment in their favor against the said Don Gregorio and Don Pedro, sentencing the later to pay the total amount of the obligation acknowledged by them in the aforementioned instrument of August 12, 1909; with the understanding that if they should deem it convenient for their interests, Don Francisco, Don Manuel, and Dona Carmen Yulo may appoint an attorney to cooperate with the lawyers of Inchausti &amp; Company in the proceedings of the said case.\"<br\/><br\/>Eighth. Matters being thus on July 10, 1911, Gregorio Yulo answered the complaint and alleged as defenses: first, that an accumulation of interest had taken place and that compound interest was asked for in Philippine currency at par with Mexican; second, that in the instrument of August 12, 1909, two conditions were agreed one of which ought to be approved by the Court of First Instance, and the other ratified and confirmed by the other brother Mariano Yulo, neither of which was complied with; third, that with regard to the same debt claims were presented before the commissioners in the special proceedings over the in-heritances of Teodoro Yulo and Gregoria Regalado, though later they were dismissed, pending the present suit; fourth and finally, that the instrument of August 12, 1909, was novated by that of May 12, 1911, executed by Manuel, Francisco and Carmen Yulo.<br\/><br\/>Ninth. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo decided the case \"in favor of the defendant without prejudice to the plaintiff's bringing within the proper time another suit for his proportional part of the joint debt, and that the plaintiff pay the costs.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B. of E., 21.)<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff appealed from this judgment by bill of exceptions and before this court made the following assignment of errors:<br\/><br\/>I.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0That the court erred in considering the contract of May 12, 1911, as constituting a novation of that of August 12, 1909.<br\/><br\/>II.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0That the court erred in rendering judgment in favor of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>III.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0And that the court erred in denying the motion for a new trial.<br\/><br\/>\"No one denies in this case,\" says the trial judge, \"that the estate of Teodoro Yulo or his heirs owe Inchausti &amp; Company an amount of money, the object of this action, namely, P253,445.42\" (B. of E. 18). \"The fact is admitted,\" says the defendant, \"that the plaintiff has not collected the debt, and that the same is owing\" (Brief, 33). \"In the arguments of the attorneys,\" the judge goes on, \"it was really admitted that the plaintiff had a right to bring an action against Gregorio Yulo, as one of the conjoint and solidary obligors in the contract of August 12, 1909; but the defendant says that the plaintiff has no right to sue him alone, since after the present suit was brought, the plaintiff entered into a compromise with the other conjoint and solidary debtors, the result being the new contract of May 12, 1911, by virtue of which the payments were extended, the same constituting a novation of the contract which gave him the same privileges that were given his conjoint and solidary codebtors. This (the judge concludes) is the only question brought up by the parties.\" (B. of E., 19.)<br\/><br\/>And this is the only one which the Supreme Court has to solve by virtue of the assignments of errors alleged. Consequently, there is no need of saying anything regarding the first three defenses of the answer, nor regarding the lack of the signature of Mariano Yulo ratifying and confirming the instrument of August 12, 1909, upon which the appellee still insists in his brief for this appeal; although it will not be superfluous to state the doctrine that a condition, such as is contained in the sixteenth clause of the said contract (third point in the statement of facts), is by no means a suspensive but a resolutory condition; the effect of the failure of compliance with the said clause, that is to say, the lack of the ratification and confirmance by Mariano Yulo being not to suspend but to resolve the contract, leaving Inchausti &amp; Company at liberty, as stipulated, \"to make use of its rights to demand and obtain the immediate payment of its credit.\"<br\/><br\/>The only question indicated in the decision of the inferior court involves, however, these others: First, whether the plaintiff can sue Gregorio Yulo alone, there being other obligors; second, if so, whether it lost this right by the fact of its having agreed with the other obligors in the reduction of the debt, the proroguing of the obligation and the extension of the time for payment, in accordance with the instrument of May 12, 1911; third, whether this contract with the said three obligors constitutes a novation of that of August 12, 1909, entered into with the six debtors who assumed the payment of two hundred fifty-three thousand and some odd pesos, the subject matter of the suit; and fourth, if not so, whether it does have any effect at all in the action brought, and in this present suit.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the first it cannot be doubted that, the debtors having obligated themselves in solidum, the creditor can bring its action<i> in toto<\/i> against any one of them, inasmuch as this was surely its purpose in demanding that the obligation contracted in its favor should be solidary having in mind the principle of law that, \"when the obligation is constituted as a conjoint and solidary obligation each one of the debtors is bound to perform in full the undertaking which is the subject matter of such obligation.\" (Civil Code, articles 1137 and 1144.)<br\/><br\/>And even though the creditor may have stipulated with some of the solidary debtors diverse installments and conditions, as in this case, Inchausti &amp; Company did with its debtors Manuel, Francisco, and Carmen Yulo through the instrument of May 12, 1911, this does not lead to the conclusion that the solidarity stipulated in the instrument of August 12, 1909 is broken, as we already know the law provides that \"solidarity may exist even though the debtors are not bound in the same manner and for the same periods and under the same conditions.\" (<i>Ibid.<\/i>, article 1140.) Whereby the second point is resolved.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the third, there can also be no doubt that the contract of May 12, 1911, does not constitute a novation of the former one of August 12, 1909, with respect to the other debtors who executed this contract, or more concretely, with respect to the defendant Gregorio Yulo: First, because \"in order that an obligation may be extinguished by another which substitutes it, it is necessary that it should be so expressly declared or that the old and the new be incompatible in all points\" (Civil Code, article 1204) ; and the instrument of May 12, 1911, far from expressly declaring that the obligation of the three who executed it substitutes the former signed by Gregorio Yulo and the other debtors, expressly and clearly stated that the said obligation of Gregorio Yulo to pay the two hundred and fifty-three thousand and odd pesos sued for exists, stipulating that the suit must continue its course and, if necessary, these three parties who executed the contract of May 12, 1911, would cooperate in order that the action against Gregorio Yulo might prosper (7th point in the statement of facts), with other undertakings concerning the execution of the judgment which might be rendered against Gregorio Yulo in this same suit. \"It is always necessary to state that it is the intention of the contracting parties to extinguish the former obligation by the new one\" (Judgment in cassation, July 8, 1909). There exist no incompatibility between the old and the new obligation as will, be demonstrated in the resolution of the last point, and for the present we will merely reiterate the legal doctrine that an obligation to pay a sum of money is not novated in a new instrument wherein the old is ratified, by changing only the term of payment and adding other obligations not incompatible with the old one. (Judgments in cassation of June 28, 1904 and of July 8, 1909.)<br\/><br\/>With respect to the last point, the following must be borne in mind:<br\/><br\/><i>Facts.<\/i>\u2014First. Of the nine children of T. Yulo, six exe-cuted the mortgage of August 12, 1909, namely, Gregorio, Pedro, Francisco, Manuel, Carmen, and Conception, admit-ting a debt of P253,445.42 at 10 per cent per annum and mortgaging six-ninths of their hereditary properties. Sec-ond. Of those six children, Francisco, Manuel and Carmen executed the instrument of May 12, 1911, wherein was obtained a reduction of the capital to 225,000 pesos and of the interest to 6 per cent from the 15th of March of the same year of 1911. Third. The other children of T. Yulo named Mariano, Teodoro, and Jose have not taken part in these instruments and have not mortgaged their hereditary portions. Fourth. By the first instrument the maturity of the first installment was June 30, 1910, whereas by the second instrument, Francisco, Manuel, and Carmen had in their favor as the maturity of the first installment of their debt, June 30, 1912, and Fifth, on March 27, 1911, the action against Gregorio Yulo was already filed and judgment was pronounced on December 22, 1911, when the whole debt was not yet due nor even the first installment of the same respecting the three aforesaid debtors, Francisco, Manuel, and Carmen.<br\/><br\/><i>In jure<\/i> it would follow that by sentencing Gregorio Yulo to pay 253,445 pesos and 42 centavos, the sum demanded as capital by virtue of the instrument of August 12, 1909, this debtor, if he should pay all this sum, could not recover from his joint debtors Francisco, Manuel, and Carmen their proportional parts of the P253,445.42 which he had paid, inasmuch as the three were not obligated by virtue of the instrument of May 12, 1911, to pay only 225,000 pesos, thus constituting a violation of Gregorio Yulo's right under such hypothesis, of being reimbursed for the sum paid by him, with the interest of the amounts advanced at the rate of one-sixth part from each of his five codebtors. (Civ. Code, article 1145, par. 2). This result would have been a ponderous obstacle against the prospering of the suit as it had been brought. It would have been very just then to have absolved the solidary debtor who having to pay the debt in its entirety would not be able to demand contribution from his codebtors in order that they might reimburse him pro rata for the amount advanced for them by him. But such hypothesis must be put out of consideration by reason of the fact that occurred during the pendency of the action, which fact the judge states in his decision. \"In this contract of May last,\" he says, \"the amount of the debt was reduced to P225,000 and the attorney of the plaintiff admits in his plea that Gregorio Yulo has a right to the benefit of this reduction.\" (B. of E.( 19.) This is a fact which this Supreme Court must hold as firmly established, considering that the plaintiff in its brief, on page 27, corro-borates the same in these words: \"What effect,\" it says, \"could this contract have over the rights and obligations of the defendant Gregorio Yulo with respect to the plaintiff company? In the first place, we are the first to realize that it benefits him with respect to the reduction of the amount of the debt. The obligation being solidary, the remission of any part of the debt made by a creditor in favor of one or more of the solidary debtors necessarily benefits the others, and therefore there can be no doubt that, in accordance with the provision of article 1143 of the Civil Code, the defendant has the right to enjoy the benefits of the partial remission of the debt granted by the creditor.\"<br\/><br\/>Wherefore we hold that although the contract of May 12, 1911, has not novated that of August 12, 1909, it has affected that contract and the outcome of the suit brought against Gregorio Yulo alone for the sum of P253,445.42; and in consequence thereof, the amount stated in the con-tract of August 12, 1909, cannot be recovered but only that stated in the contract of May 12, 1911, by virtue of the remission granted to the three of the solidary debtors in this instrument, in conformity with what is provided in article 1143 of the Civil Code, cited by the creditor itself.<br\/><br\/>If the efficacy of the later instrument over the former touching the amount of the debt had been recognized, should such efficacy not likewise be recognized concerning the maturity of the same? If Francisco, Manuel, and Carmen had been included in the suit, they could have alleged the defense of the nonmaturity of the installments since the first installment did not mature until June 30, 1912, and without the least doubt the defense would have prospered, and the three would have been absolved from the suit. Cannot this defense of the prematurity of the action, which is implied in the last special defense set up in the answer of the defendant Gregorio Yulo be made available to him in this proceeding?<br\/>\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0The following commentary on article 1140 of the Civil Code sufficiently answers this question: \"* * * Before the performance of the condition, or before the execution of a term which affects one debtor alone proceedings may be had against him or against any of the others for the remainder which may be already demandable but the conditional obligation or that which has not yet matured cannot be demanded from any one of them. Article 1148 confirms the rule which we now enunciate inasmuch as in case the total claim is made by one creditor, which we believe improper if directed against the debtor affected by the condition or the term, the latter can make use of such exceptions as are peculiarly personal to his own obligation; and if against the other debtors, they <i>might <\/i>make use of those exceptions, even though they are personal to the other, inasmuch as they alleged them in connection <i>with that part of the responsibility<\/i> attaching in a special manner to the other.\" (8 Manresa, Sp. Civil Code, 196.)<br\/>\u00a0<br\/>Article 1148 of the Civil Code.\u2014\"The solidary debtor may utilize against the claims of the creditor all the defenses arising from the nature of the obligation and those which are personal to him. Those personally pertaining to the others may be employed by him only with regard to the share of the debt for which the latter may be liable.\"<br\/><br\/>Gregorio Yulo cannot allege as a defense to the action that it is premature. When the suit was brought on March 27, 1911, the first installment of the obligation had already matured of June 30, 1910, and with the maturity of this installment, the first not having been paid, the whole debt had become mature, according to the express agreement of the parties, independently of the resolutory condition which gave the creditor the right to demand the immediate payment of the whole debt upon the expiration of the stipulated term of one week allowed to secure from Mariano Yulo the ratification and confirmation of the contract of August 12, 1909.<br\/><br\/>Neither could he invoke a like exception for the shares of his solidary codebtors, ;Pedro and Concepcion Yulo, they being in identical condition as he.<br\/>\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0But as regards Francisco, Manuel, and Carmen Yulo, none of the installments payable under their obligation, contracted later, had as yet matured. The first payment, as already stated, was to mature on June 30, 1912. This exception or personal defense of Francisco, Manuel, and Carmen Yulo \"as to that part of the debt for which they were responsible\" can be set up by Gregorio Yulo as a partial defense to the action. The part of the debt for which these three are responsible is three-sixths of P225,000 or P112,500, so that Gregorio Yulo may claim that, even acknowledging that the debt for which he is liable is P225,000, nevertheless not all of it can now be demanded of him, for that part of it which pertained to his codebtors is not yet due, a state of affairs which not only prevents any action against the persons who were granted the term which has not yet matured, but also against the other solidary debtors who being ordered to pay could not now sue for a contribution, and for this reason the action will be only as to the P112,500.<br\/>\u00a0<br\/>Against the propriety and legality of a judgment against Gregorio Yulo for this sum, to wit, the three-sixths part of the debt which forms the subject matter of the suit, we do not think that there was any reason or argument offered which sustains an opinion that for the present it is not proper to order him to pay all or part of the debt, the object of the action.<br\/><br\/>It has been said in the brief of the appellee that the prematurity of the action is one of the defenses derived from the nature of the obligation, according to the opinion of the commentator of the Civil Code, Mucius Scaevola, and consequently the defendant Gregorio Yulo may make use of it in accordance with article 1148 of the said Code. It may be so and yet, taken in that light, the effect would not be different from that already stated in this decision; Gregorio Yulo could not be freed from making any payment whatever but only from the payment of that part of the debt which corresponds to his codebtors Francisco, Manuel, and Carmen.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The same author, considering the case of the opposing contention of two solidary debtors as to one of whom the obligation is pure and unconditional and as to the other it is conditional and is not yet demandable, and comparing the disadvantages which must flow from holding that the obligation is demandable with these which must follow if the contrary view is adopted, favors this solution of the problem:<br\/><br\/>\"There is a middle ground, (he says), from which we can safely set out, to wit, that the creditor may of course, demand the payment of his credit against the debtor not favored by any condition or extension of time.\" And further on, he decides the question as to whether the whole debt may be recovered or only that part unconditionally owing or which has already matured, saying, \"Without failing to proceed with juridical rigor, but without falling into extravagances or monstrosities, we believe that the solution of the difficulty is perfectly possible. How? By limiting the right of the creditor to the recovery of the amount owed by the debtors bound unconditionally or as to whom the obligation has matured, and leaving in suspense the right to demand the payment of the remainder until the expiration of the term of the fulfillment of the condition. But what then is the effect of solidarity? How can this restriction of right be reconciled with the duty imposed upon each one of the debtors to answer for the whole obligation? Simply this, by recognizing in the creditor the power, upon the performance of the condition or the expiration of the term of claiming from any one or all of the debtors that part of the obligation affected by those conditions.\" (Scaevola, Civil Code, 19, 800 and 801.)<br\/><br\/>It has been said also by the trial judge in his decision that if a judgment be entered against Gregorio Yulo for the whole debt of P253,445.42, he cannot recover from Francisco, Manuel, and Carmen Yulo that part of the amount which is owed by them because they are obliged to pay only 225,000 pesos and this in eight installments none of which was due. For this reason he was of the opinion that he (Gregorio Yulo) cannot be obliged to pay his part of the debt before the contract of May 12, 1911, may be enforced, and \"consequently he decided the case in favor of the defendant, without prejudice to the plaintiff proceeding in due time against him for his proportional part of the joint debt.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B. of E., 21 and 22.)<br\/><br\/>But in the first place, taking inte consideration the conformity of the plaintiff and the provision of article 1143 of the Civil Code, it is no longer possible to sentence the defendant to pay the P53,445.42 of the instrument of August 12, 1909, but, if anything, the P225,000 of the instrument of May 12, 1911.<br\/><br\/>In the second place, neither is it possible to curtail the defendant's right of recovery from the signers of the instrument of May 12, 1911, for he was justly exonerated from the payment of that part of the debt corresponding to them by reason of there having been upheld in his favor the exception of an unmatured installment which pertains to them.<br\/><br\/>In the third place, it does not seem just, Mucius Scaevola considers it \"absurd,\" that, there being a debtor who is unconditionally obligated as to when the debt has matured, the creditor should be forced to await the realization of the condition (or the expiration of the term). Not only is there no reason for this, as stated by the author, but the court would even fail to consider the special law of the contract, neither repealed nor novated, which cannot be emitted without violating article 1091 of the Civil Code according to which \"the obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and must be complied with in accordance with the tenor of the same.\" Certain it is that the trial court, in holding that this action was premature but might be brought in due time, regarded the contract of August 12, 1909, as having been expressly novated; but it is absolutely impossible in law to sustain such supposed novation, in accordance with the legal principles already stated, and nevertheless the obligation of the contract of May 12, 1911, must likewise be complied with in accordance with its tenor, which is contrary in all respects to the supposed novation, by obliging the parties who signed the contract to carry on the suit brought against Gregorio Yulo. The contract of May 12, 1911, has affected the action and the suit, to the extent that Gregorio Yulo has been able to make in his favor the defense of remission of part of the debt, thanks to the provision of article 1148, because it is a defense derived from the nature of the obligation, so that although the said defendant was not party to the contract in question, yet because of the principle of solidarity he was benefited by it.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Gregorio Yulo cannot be ordered to pay the P253,445.42 claimed from him in the suit here, because he has been benefited by the remission made by the plaintiff to three of his codebtors, many times named above.<br\/>Consequently, the debt is reduced to 225,000 pesos.<br\/><br\/>But, as it cannot be enforced against the defendant except as to the three-sixths part which is what he can recover from his joint codebtors Francisco, Manuel, and Carmen, at present, judgment can be rendered only as to the P112,500.<br\/><br\/>We therefore sentence the defendant Gregorio Yulo to pay the plaintiff Inchausti &amp; Company P112,500, with the interest stipulated in the instrument of May 12, 1911, from March 15, 1911, and the legal interest on this interest due, from the time that it was claimed judicially in accordance with article 1109 of the Civil Code, without any special finding as to costs. The judgment appealed from is re-versed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Carson, Trent, <\/i>and<i> Araullo, JJ., c<\/i>oncur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"center\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/><center><i>DISSENTING<\/i><br\/><\/center> <br\/><br\/>MORELAND,<i> J., <\/i><br\/><br\/>In my judgment the action must be dismissed, as it was brought prematurely. The defendant was entitled to all of the benefits of the contract of May 12, 1911, between the plaintiff and Francisco, Manuel, and Carmen. One of these provisions was that the first payment need not be made until June 30, 1912. The action was commenced on the 27th of March, 1911, and although this date was prior to the date of the second contract, that is, the contract with Francisco, Manuel, and Carmen, said contract was executed before the trial of the action, and some of the beneficial provisions therein contained were to produce their effects from March 15, 1911, a date prior to the commencement of the action. At the time of the trial the defendant could, in my judgment, have interposed, under the allegations of the amended answer, any of the defenses which could have been made use of by Francisco, Manuel, or Carmen if they had been the defendant. That being the case, nothing was due the plaintiff at the time it sued and accordingly its action must be dismissed with costs.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons I vote to affirm.<br\/><\/div>",

From this \njudgment said defendant has appealed.<\/p>\n<p>In one of the two briefs submitted by the defense in this instance it is \nmaintained that the court violated section 16 of General Orders, No. 58, by \nsentencing the defendant without the intervention of his attorneys, one of the \nlatter having through inexcusable negligence and intentional omission failed to \npresent evidence in defense of said defendant; and it is requested in said brief \nthat a new trial be ordered.<\/p>\n<p>From the record it appears that the defendant Dungca and the others indicted \nalong with him appeared at the trial accompanied by the attorneys E. Gutierrez \nDavid and Aurelio Pineda; that during the trial the first-named attorney \nobjected on the part of the defendants, without excepting any of them and \ntherefore including Dungca, to the admission of various documents presented by \nthe prosecution and to various questions put by it; that, although in putting \nthe witness Felix Bustos on the stand for the defense and in asking him about \nthe office each one of the accused had held in the municipality of Macabebe, he \ndid not do so definitely with reference to the defendant Dungca, the other \nattorney, Pineda, made the proposition to the fiscal, which was accepted by him, \nto stipulate that the accused, each and all of them, in case they were put on \nthe stand in their own behalf, would testify that they had held the office of \ntenientes, as Felix Bustos had testified, with the exception of Francisco \nSanchez, who was going to testify, as he did in fact testify, as a witness; and \nwhen the court asked each one of the accused, among them Agaton Dungca, whether \nthe attorney, said Pineda, was authorized to make that stipulation, all of them \nanswered in the affirmative.<\/p>\n<p>It is not, therefore, true that opportunity was not allowed the defendant \nDungca to prepare his defense in this trial, nor that he was sentenced without \nthe intervention of attorneys to defend him therein, as is affirmed in said \nbrief. Neither is it strictly true that he was not defended or, what amounts to \nthe same thing, that his attorneys did nothing at the trial which would have \ntended to defend him, for the stipulation itself proposed by the attorney Pineda \nand accepted by the fiscal, in not expressly excluding said defendant, but only \nthe person named Francisco Sanchez, demonstrates that it was the purpose of said \nattorney to present evidence in Dungca's favor, perhaps under the same \nconditions as for the other accused. Consequently, the error assigned in that \nrespect is groundless.<\/p>\n<p>But, admitting that at the trial the attorneys for the defendant made some \nomission, oversight or mistake in submitting and handling the evidence with \nrespect to said Dungca, or some error in regard to the sufficiency, importance \nor consequence of what they ought to have presented in said defendant's favor, \nthat would not serve as a basis for a new trial, as this court has declared in \nthe case of the United States <em>vs.<\/em> Umali (15 Phil. Rep., 33). It is true \nthat in the decision cited, this court said that to prevent a manifest \nmiscarriage of justice in a jurisdiction wherein a wholly new system of judicial \nprocedure is being implanted, the rigor of the rule might in an exceptional case \nbe relaxed, this would be done only under very exceptional circumstances, and in \ncases where a review of the whole record taken together with the evidence \nimprovidently omitted would clearly justify the conclusion that the omission had \nresulted in the conviction of one innocent of the crime charged. But such are \nnot the circumstances of the present case, as is demonstrated by the contents of \nthe other brief presented in defense of the same defendant.<\/p>\n<p>In said brief it is substantially acknowledged that Agaton Dungca has not \nbeen capitan municipal, gobernadorcillo, alcalde, teniente, or cabeza de \nbarangay, but merely an alguacil, according to the testimony of the witness for \nthe prosecution Juan de la Cruz (page 14 of the stenographic notes and Exhibit \nF, page 31), but it is maintained that as such alguacil he was a member of the \ngovernment of the municipality to which he belonged, that is, of Macabebe, and \nthat he is therefore; according to the defense, included in subsection \n(<em>a<\/em>) of section 13 of the Election Law and qualified to be a voter. In \nthe presence of such an explicit acknowledgment on the part of counsel for the \ndefendant in his brief, it is useless to reopen the trial and attempt to prove \nthat the defendant Agaton Dungca had, previous to August 13, 1898, held any \noffice other than that of alguacil of the municipal government of Macabebe; and \nit only remains to be determined if as such alguacil he was a member of that \nmunicipal government.<\/p>\n<p>The officers composing the municipal governments in the Philippines, \naccording to the royal decree creating them, dated November 12, 1889, were the \nalcalde, teniente de alcalde, sindico, regidores or councilors, and secretaries, \nand they were known as members of the municipal government. This classification \nwas not and could not be given to the alguaciles, as they were merely assistants \nor subordinate employees whose business was to discharge mechanical duties in \nexecuting the orders of the municipal government to which they belonged. The \nalguacil of a municipal government is, according to the Dictionary of the \nSpanish Academy, an inferior officer who executes the commands of the municipal \ngovernment or of the alcaldes or tenientes de alcaldes in matters under their \nrespective control; and the word is defined in the Diccionario de la \nAdministracion Espa\u00f1ola by Martin Alcubilla, volume 1, page 445, in these terms: \n\"The lowest officer in the administrative scale, charged with carrying out the \ndecrees for policing and good government.\" It being very clear that the lowest \nofficer of a municipal government cannot be regarded as a member of that \nmunicipal government, it is also evident that the defendant Agaton Dungca was \nnot qualified, as alleged by his defense, to be a voter in accordance with the \nprovisions of subsection (<em>a<\/em>), section 13, of the Election Law in \nforce.<\/p>\n<p>For the reasons set forth, we declare that there is no reason for granting \nthe new trial requested by one of the attorneys for the defendant Agaton Dungca, \nand we affirm the judgment appealed from, with the costs against the \nappellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Here the appellant was \nrepresented by an attorney <em>de officio.<\/em> The only defense made by the \nappellant is that the proof adduced during the trial of the cause does not \njustify, beyond a reasonable doubt, the conclusions of the lower court.<\/p>\n<p>From an examination of the evidence brought here we find that the following \nfacts are sustained beyond a reasonable doubt:<\/p>\n<p>That for a long time before the death of the said Marcelino Tipay, the \ndefendant and Maria Bautista, the mother of the deceased, had been living and \ncohabiting together; that a short time before the 6th day of December, 1913, the \ndefendant and the said Maria Bautista had a quarrel and the defendant left the \nhouse where he had been living with Maria Bautista, threatening to kill her or \nsome of her children; that a few days after the defendant had left 'the house of \nMaria Bautista, the deceased Marcelino Tipay and one of the other children of \nthe said Maria Bautista were playing in the highway on the afternoon of the 6th \nday of December, 1913; that the defendant passed by where the children were \nplaying and, for some reason or other, induced the said Marcelino Tipay to \naccompany him in the direction of an estero; that later on the same day, the \nchild (Marcelino Tipay) riot having returned home, a search was made for it; \nthat late in the evening one of the children met the defendant in the highway or \nroad, leaving the estero, and at that time the clothing of the defendant was wet \nup to his waist; that inquiry was made of him concerning the whereabouts of the \nsaid Marcelino Tipay, whereupon he immediately returned to the <em>estero,<\/em> \nwent into the water and picked up the dead body of the child from the bottom of \nthe <em>estero<\/em> and brought it ashore; that upon an examination of the body \nof the said Marcelino Tipay, it was found that the cervical vertebra had been \ndislocated. Suspicion was at once directed to the said defendant as the person \nwho had caused the death of the said Marcelino. Tipay and the next day (the 7th \nof December, 1913) a complaint was presented against him in the court of the \njustice of the peace of the municipality of Conception, Province of Tarlac, and \na preliminary examination was held by the said justice of the peace, who found \nthat there was probable cause to believe that the defendant was guilty of the \ncrime and ordered him to be held for trial in the Court of First Instance of \nsaid province. Later the case was brought to trial in the Court of First \nInstance.<\/p>\n<p>After hearing the evidence the Honorable Julio Llorente, judge, in a \ncarefully prepared opinion, in which he makes an extensive summary of the \nevidence adduced during the trial of the cause, reached the conclusion that the \nevidence showed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was guilty of the \ncrime of homicide. The lower court found that there were no circumstances upon \nwhich he could qualify the crime as assassination. <\/p>\n<p>The defendant, at the time of the trial, was a man of forty years of age. The \ndeceased was a child of seven years of age. The supreme court of Spain has held \nin numerous decisions, and those decisions have been followed by this court, \nthat the qualifying circumstance of treachery exists whenever one person employs \nmeans, methods and forms which insure the execution or commission of the crime \nwithout any danger arising or resulting to himself from the acts of the person \nattacked. 1 Alcubilla, 444. Decision of the supreme court of Spain of July 13, \n1897; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> De Leon (1 Phil. Rep., 163); U. S.<em> vs.<\/em> Ricafor \n(1 Phil. Rep., 173); U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Rubeta (1 Phil.

S. <em>vs.<\/em> \nAlvarez (3 Phil. Rep., 24).<\/p>\n<p>The supreme court of Spain has also held (and this court has followed said \ndecisions) in considering alevosia as a qualifying circumstance of the crime of \nassassination, that when an adult person illegally attacks a child of tender \nyears and causes its death, that he runs no risk whatever of personal injury to \nhimself from such attack and that therefore in such a case alevosia should be \nconsidered as a qualifying circumstance of the crime, and the same should be \nqualified as assassination. In the present case the child was of tender years, \nbeing but seven years old. Whatever method the defendant employed, in causing \nthe death of the deceased, the same was done without any possibility of danger \nresulting to himself from the child. The crime, therefore, in the present case \nshould be qualified as that of assassination. Decisions of the supreme court of \nSpain: January 26, 1877 (where the child was 30 months old); October 29, 1879 \n(where the child was 11 years old); October 10,1883 (a child of tender years); \nNovember 15, 1895 (where the child was 3 years old); July 13, 1897 (a young \nchild).

Considering all of the facts and circumstances, \nhowever, and the ignorance of the defendant, we are disposed to give him the \nbenefit of article 11 of the Penal Code as an extenuating circumstance, and \nimpose upon him the minimum penalty provided for the crime of assassination. The \nsentence of the lower court is therefore hereby reversed and it is hereby \nordered and decreed that a sentence be entered declaring that the defendant is \nguilty of the crime of assassination, with the qualifying circumstance of \n<em>alevosia,<\/em> and the extenuating circumstance of article 11 of the Penal \nCode, and sentencing the defendant to be imprisoned for a period of twenty years \nof <em>cadena temporal,<\/em> to suffer the accessory penalties provided for by \nlaw, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000, and to pay the \ncosts.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

He \ntherefore prayed for the dismissal of the application, with the costs against \nthe applicant.<\/p>\n<p>At the hearing of the case, besides the opposition of the Director of Lands, \nthere appeared likewise as objectors the applicants for homestead Severo \nSanchez, Leoncio Sanchez, and Francisco Aquino, and, after an examination of the \nparol and documentary evidence submitted by the parties, the court rendered the \njudgment aforementioned, to which counsel for the applicant excepted and moved \nfor a rehearing. This motion was denied, an exception was taken by the applicant \nand, the latter having presented the proper bill of exceptions, the same was \napproved, certified, and forwarded to the clerk of this court, together with a \ntranscript of the documentary and parol evidence taken at the trial.<br\/><br\/>In \norder that approval may be secured for an. application for the registration of \nreal estate, whether rural or urban, in the property registry, in accordance \nwith the laws that govern in the matter, it is indispensable that the applicant \nsatisfactorily prove that he is the owner or proprietor of the land or, real \nproperty which he seeks to have inscribed in the registry.<\/p>\n<p>The record in the case at bar discloses that the applicant, Tiburcia de Liza, \nacquired from her parents, Gil de Liza and Teresa Dizon, the said rural \nproperty, through a donation <em>inter vivos,<\/em> which was recorded in a \nnotarial instrument wherein, moreover, the said donation is shown to have been \naccepted by the donees; that Gil de Liza succeeded in uniting into one single \nlarge tract of land, the subject matter of the application, several parcels of \nland, some of them by purchase and others through occupation\u2014a possession \nafterwards legalized by composition titles obtained from the Government under \nthe previous sovereignty; and that her possession of a certain area of 55 \nhectares toward the east of the said large tract of land appears to be \naccredited by the possessory information approved by an order of April 11, 1893* \nand inscribed in the property registry on May 12 of the same year.<\/p>\n<p>The record also shows that the applicant and her predecessors, Gil de Liza \nand his wife, have been for more than thirty years in possession of the said \nproperty composed of several parcels of land, utilizing it for the growing of \nrice, sugar cane and other useful crops, aside from the possession enjoyed by \nthe former owners from whom the said Gil de Liza had acquired or purchased a \npart of the property in question.<\/p>\n<p>In view of the documentary and parol evidence furnished by the applicant, the \ncourt held that the latter as well as her predecessors had been in legitimate \npossession, under title of ownership, of the land designated on the plan, \nExhibit A, as situated on the west, as far as points 23 and 42, and although its \narea is much greater than what it is shown to be by the documents exhibited as \ntitles to the said property, the court was nevertheless of the opinion that the \nexcess in area was due to errors in the surveys on which the titles granted by \nthe Government were based. He therefore held that the greater part of the land \ncomprised by the plan, Exhibit A, from its extreme western boundary to points 23 \nand 42 of the plan, toward the east, belonged to the applicant, and that the \nlatter was entitled to have the said large tract of land inscribed in the \nproperty registry.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to the parcel of land comprised within the area extending from \nthe said points 23 and 42 of the plan toward the east in the direction of the \nBatibat Creek, the court held that the applicant had presented no title of \nownership obtained through composition with the Government, and that for it she \nwould therefore have to rely upon the provisions of subsection 6 of section 54 \nof Act No. 926.<\/p>\n<p>Three parcels of land included in the plan, Exhibit A, between the said \npoints 23 and 42 and the eastern boundary toward the Batibat Creek, were duly \nacquired from their original owners by the applicant's father and predecessor in \ninterest: one of them, of 22 hectares, in September, 1888; another, of 16\u00a3 \nhectares, in August, 1891; and the third parcel, of 22 hectares, in August, \n1892. Gil de Liza held possession of the said three parcels of land from the \ndates just mentioned Until April, 1911, when he and his wife made the donation \nbefore referred to, but prior to so doing, and in order to legalize his \npossession by placing it under the protection of the law, he secured the said \npossessory information and recorded it in the property registry in the following \nmonth of May. The applicant proved, furthermore; that she, her predecessor in \ninterest, and the original owners of the parcels purchased had been in \npossession of the land extending from the points 23 and 42 toward the east and \nthe Batibat Creek, although Gil de Liza voluntarily stated in his testimony that \nthe whole tract of land was not plowed and cultivated, but only a part of it \ntoward the west, for the Reason that the clearing of the land, covered with \nforest toward the said Batibat Creek, had been and was very costly, and \nfurthermore because the revolution that broke out prevented him from continuing \nto plow and clear the whole of the said part covered with forest. However, by \nthe testimony of the witnesses Juan Gomez and Isaac Casupanan, who had been \nworking on this property, it was proven that a large part of the land shown in \nthe plan as on the east was under cultivation and planted in rice, sugar cane \nand other crops.<\/p>\n<p>It is to be observed that, as stated by the trial judge, it is difficult, if \nnot impossible, to fix the former boundaries of each parcel, owing to the fact \nthat one parcel was added to another as the applicant's father acquired it \nthrough occupation and composition with the Government or by purchase from its \nformer owners, all these parcels being incorporated into one single tract, as \nshown in the said plan, Exhibit A. Notwithstanding this, none of the owners of \nthe adjoining lands, nor any other who claimed to be injured protested against \nthe application for registration, except the three parties who each occupied by \nright of homestead a parcel of land toward the eastern end in the part that was \nunplowed and uncleared of forest, near the Batibat Creek.<\/p>\n<p>Besides, the possession of the land shown on the plan as lying toward the \neast, which was held by the applicant's predecessor in interest and is now held \nby the said Tiburcia de Liza, appears to have been duly proven by means of \nwitnesses and the said possessory information. This latter, moreover, shows that \nan irrigation system was afterwards installed on the aforementioned land, which \nbefore was unirrigated, at the expense of its possessor, Gil de Liza an ancestor \nof the applicant, and this improvement would not have been, made if the person \nwho paid for it had not owned the land.<\/p>\n<p>The possessor of land who is provided with a possessory information title \ninscribed in the property registry is entitled in law and before the courts to \nbe held a lawful possessor as owner, so long as no other interested party \nappears and proves a better right, for the said registered possessory \ninformation is prima facie proof of his right of possession under just title and \nhas the same efficacy as that vested in all other titles enumerated in Acts No. \n496 and No. 809. (Inchausti &amp; Co. vs. The Commanding General of the Division \nof the Philippines, 6 Phil, Rep., 556, and other subsequent decisions of this \ncourt, in all of Which the same theory has been uniformly maintained.)<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, the owners of the two adjoining parcels of land on the north and \nthe south, Cayetano Rivera and Engracia Gonzalez, respectively, each obtained \nfrom the Court of Land Registration a decree of registration of their land, and \nthe land comprised by the said possessory information was the recognized \nboundary, on the south side, of the land of Cayetano Rivera, and on the north \nside, of that of Engracia Gonzalez, for the land that was the subject matter of \nthe possessory information brought by the said Gil de Liza, the predecessor in \ninterest of the applicant, Tiburcia de Liza, was situated just between the two \nproperties of the said Rivera and Gonzalez, who recognized Gil de Liza as the \nlawful possessor, if not. as the owner, of the land between their respective \nparcels. All these facts appear in the copies of the judgments of the land court \nrendered in their respective cases, and in the copies of the plans of their \nlands, found on pages 129 to 134 of this record. <\/p>\n<p>The admission and judicial recognition on the part of Rivera and Gonzalez, \nthe owners of the lands to the north and south of the land that is the subject \nmatter of the said possessory information inscribed in the property registry, of \nthe applicant's character and quality of possessor, under right of ownership, of \nthe land situated between their respective properties, virtually corroborates \nthe parol evidence adduced by the applicant and the value and efficacy of the \nsaid possessory information recorded in the registry on May 12, 1893. Owing to \nthe lapse of more than twenty years, this possessory information now constitutes \na true and lawful title of ownership of the land to which it refers and which \nwas, nevertheless, excluded from registration by the judgment appealed from. \nThese conclusions are based on the facts that no one has disputed the \napplicant's right to the land, except the three objectors, the possessors \nthrough homestead of three small parcels of the same toward its eastern end near \nthe Batibat Creek, already expressly defined in the plan, Exhibit A, and that \nthe said possessory information has not been impugned and assailed as false, \neither civilly or criminally.<br\/><br\/>These three parcels must be that part of \nthe land which Gil de Liza admitted he was unable to clear and plow, because; \namong other reasons, of the outbreak of the revolution, and being thus in a \ncertain manner materially abandoned by the possessor of the remainder of the \nland, they were occupied by the said three, objectors, who relied upon the \nbenefits granted by Act No. 926.<\/p>\n<p>Although the record in this case does not disclose whether the said three \nobjectors, the possessors of those parcels of land, had obtained a grant of the \nsame as homesteads, in accordance with law, yet, since the applicant has not \nproven that such objectors' allegation is not true or unfounded, it is to be \npresumed that the applicant is not in possession of the parcels of land occupied \nby the aforesaid three objectors, for her predecessor in interest averred in his \nsworn testimony that he was unable to clear and plow them, wherefore, as he did \nnot in fact possess them, while these objectors did through the homestead \nprivilege, it would be improper to register in the applicant's name the said \nthree' parcels of land situated toward the east and near the Batibat Creek and \nwhich are described as within certain boundaries and separated by lines from the \nmain tract of land held by the applicant as the owner and proprietor \nthereof.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from is affirmed; provided, \nhowever, after a declaration of general default, the registration of all the \nland described in the plan Exhibit A, shall be ordered and decreed in the name \nand in behalf of the applicant, Tiburcia de Liza, with the sole exclusion of the \nthree parcels of land situated toward the east near the Batibat Creek, which now \nappear as separated by lines from the larger area that is the subject matter of \nthe application and are occupied as homesteads by the objectors Severo and \nLeoncio Sanchez and Francisco Aquino; and provided, further, that the \napplication shall be denied as regards the said parcels of land and the \naforementioned plan shall be accordingly amended in conformity with this \ndecision.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

LIM CAY PIT, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the city \nof Manila convicting the accused of a violation of section 317 of Act No. 355, \nas amended by Section 17 of Act No. 1235, and sentencing him to pay a fine of \nP100, to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of nonpayment, and to pay the \ncosts of the trial.\n<p>The information charges: \"That on or about the 21st day of December, 1912, in \nthe city of Manila, Philippine Islands, the said Lim Cay Pit, willfully, \nillegally, and criminally and with intent to defraud the Government of the \nPhilippine Islands, committed acts and was guilty of omissions by which he \ndefrauded the said Government of the Philippine Islands of a part of its \nrevenues by the importation of merchandise which was subject to pay duty, that \nis to say, by making false declarations in invoice No. 34554 of the Manila \ncustomhouse, whereby he declared and represented that certain merchandise, to \nwit, one bale of hemp fish nets, which had been imported from Amoy, China, upon \nthe steamer <em>Taisang<\/em> on the 20th of December, 1912, which merchandise \nwas subject to a duty of 20 per cent ad valorem, was of the value of $126 \nMexican currency, equivalent to $61.74 United States currency, when in truth and \nin fact, as said accused then and there well knew, the value of said bale of \nhemp fish nets was 144.26 taels, equivalent to $106.75 United States currency; \nthereby depriving the Government of the Philippine Islands of the difference \nbetween the sum paid by said Lim Cay Pit and that which he should have paid as \nduty upon the real value of the said bale of hemp fish nets which he imported \nand brought into the city of Manila as aforesaid.\"<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Neuffer, who had been designated by the Insular Collector of Customs to \nreceive on behalf of the Bureau of Customs the original invoices of merchandise \nentering the port of Manila, testified that when the original entry voucher No. \n28901, corresponding with entry No. 34554, was presented to him he asked the \naccused if he would swear that the document was correct and exact according to \nhis knowledge and belief, and that the accused raised his right hand and nodded \nhis head. The bill of lading, the invoice, and an English translation of the \nlatter, also presented to the clerk at the customhouse, were offered in \nevidence. The prices on the invoice correspond with those in\u00bbthe original entry \nvoucher.<\/p>\n<p>The customs authorities being suspicious that the defendant had \nmisrepresented the true value of the articles listed in his invoice, special \nagents of the customhouse, Theobald Diehl and Leopoldo Roeder, called upon the \ndefendant and asked him for permission to examine his account books. He produced \nthree books, one of which was offered in evidence. A qualified translator made \nan examination of this book and on page 80 thereof found an account of the \nmerchandise listed in the original entry voucher already referred to. According \nto the book the cost to the defendant of the fish nets listed in said original \nentry voucher was $106.75 United States currency instead of $61.74 United States \ncurrency. The duty actually paid by the defendant upon these nets was 20 per \ncent ad valorem on the value fixed by the Collector of Customs or $12.93 United \nStates currency. Had the goods been declared in the original entry voucher at \nthe value set forth in the account book the tariff duty thereon would have been \n$21.35, or an increase of $8.42 United States currency over the amount actually \npaid.<\/p>\n<p>The principal question presented for our determination and the one upon which \nthe decision of the case depends is: Was the declaration made by the accused \nfalse and was its falsity known to him at the time of the declaration ? <\/p>\n<p>Section 164 of Act No. 355 provides that \"all invoices of imported \nmerchandise shall be made out in the currency of the place or country from \nwhence the importation shall be made'* and section 161 of the same Act declares \nthat, \"The description on the entry of the merchandise shall be * * * in the \ncurrency of the invoice.\" It is also provided that the declaration shall show \nthe market value of the merchandise in the country from which it was imported. \nThe translation of the invoice filed with and attached to the declaration which \nis the basis of this action and which is known in the evidence as Exhibit A-3 \nshows the value of the merchandise to have been $126 Amoy currency or Mexican \ncurrency, which is the same thing, and was so declared by the defendant in said \ndeclaration; and the translation of the Chinese invoice, Exhibit A-2, read into \nthe record by Yeung Chu Kai, a witness for the prosecution, was \"1 bundle fish \nnets, cost price $126.\" No attempt was made by the prosecution to impeach this \ninvoice, no evidence adduced showing: that any other invoice ever existed, and \nit was not questioned that the price given therein was Mexican or Amoy currency. \nIt is true that, on the cross-examination of the defendant, he stated that he \nhad received a copy of the invoice, but upon further cross-examination he also \nstated that he did not mean to say a duplicate of the invoice but a bill for the \ngoods covered in the invoice and for the sum named in the invoice. No one \ntestified that the value of the goods in Amoy as stated in the declaration was \nincorrect and no evidence has been introduced showing that the market value of \nthe fish nets in Amoy was different from that stated in the invoice and in the \ndeclaration for entry.<\/p>\n<p>The prosecution claims that the declaration is impeached and shown to be \nfalse by a certain book belonging to the accused which was introduced in \nevidence by the prosecution, which contains a list of merchandise which the \naccused had imported for some years past and the market values thereof in the \ncountry from which the importations had been made. The value of the importation \nin question, as set forth in the book, is nearly 100 per cent higher than that \nfound in the declaration. The prosecution also claims that it has impeached the \ndeclaration and shown it to be false by means of a confession in writing made by \nthe accused, duly signed by him, in which he admits that the value stated in the \ninvoice and in the declaration was false.<\/p>\n<p>The book referred to by the prosecution as containing an entry by the accused \nshowing the value of the merchandise Imported to have been greater than that \ndeclared or invoiced is so closely connected with the alleged confession of the \naccused that we shall speak of them together. It appears that, during an \ninvestigation conducted by the special agents of the customhouse after the \nimportation complained of in this action, their attention was called to a \ndiscrepancy between the value of certain goods recently imported, as represented \nin the book and as listed in entry No. 2613. Thereupon the defendant was \nsummoned to appear before the appraiser of the port and was asked to explain the \nvariation in the values placed on the merchandise described in that entry. This \nproceeding was a different proceeding from that in which the declaration was \nmade which is the basis of this action and referred to goods imported on the \nsteamship <em>Rubi<\/em> on the 30th of January, 1913. These goods were entirely \ndifferent from those imported on the steamship Taisang on the 20th of December, \n1912, which is the importation from which the present action springs. This \nproceeding was entitled by the customs department: \"Proceedings before the \nacting appraiser of the port, Manila, upon importations of Lim Cay Pit; \nspecifically in the case of entry No. 2613, ex steamship <em>Rubi<\/em>, reg. 52, \narrived January 30, 1913.\" It had nothing to do with the importation which is \nthe basis of the action at bar except that the investigation made in the case \nbefore us probably led to the investigation of the importation made on the \nsteamer <em>Rubi.<\/em> The alleged confession was obtained in the proceeding \nwith reference to the importation on the <em>Rubi<\/em> and the books spoken of \nby the prosecution, one of which was introduced in evidence, were obtained from \nthe accused during that investigation. The confession is a typewritten one and \nis headed by this statement:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Proceedings before the acting appraiser of the port, Manila, upon \nimportations of Lim Cay Pit; specifically in the case of entry No. 2613, ex \nsteamship <em>Rubi,<\/em> reg, 52, arrived January 30, 1913.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It reads as follows: \"A question having arisen as to the proper valuation of \nthe merchandise declared in the above named entry, the acting appraiser of the \nport, under the provisions of section 194 of the Customs Administrative Act, \ncalled before him, the said importer, who appeared in person accompanied by his \nattorney, Hartford Beaumont, and his interpreter, by the name of Chan Yek Sam, \nand the acting appraiser of the port requested, through his interpreter, the \nproduction of additional books and evidence to sustain the value of the invoice \npresented with the mentioned entry. Thereupon Lim Cay Pit, a partner of the firm \nof that name, surrendered three ledgers under statement that therein were \ncontained the correct amounts of the various purchases made by him during the \nlast three years. He declares that the amounts as shown by the invoices filed \nwith his customs entries were in error, and that the true amounts paid by him \nfor the goods in question are those set forth in the three ledgers or books \nreferred to.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The above was read to Lim Cay Pit by the acting appraiser of the port, \nthrough the customs interpreter, Campton, in the presence of Beaumont and of his \nown interpreter, Chan Yek Sam, and thereupon duly signed by Lim Cay Pit, to \nwhich the others have affixed their signatures in attestation \nthereof.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Campton, a witness for the prosecution, stated in effect that he, at the \ninstance of the acting appraiser of the port, interpreted this document to the \ndefendant, as did also one Chan Yek Sam, private interpreter for Mr. Beaumont, \nthe attorney for the defendant at that time. On cross-examination Mr. Campton \ntestified that when the contents of the document were explained to defendant, he \nemphatically denounced it as untrue and incorrect, protesting: earnestly that he \nhad done no wrong, and absolutely refusing to sign the same. This was \ninterpreted to the acting appraiser, to Mr. Roeder, and to Mr. Beaumont, and Mr. \nBeaumont thereupon insisted upon the defendant signing the document, warning him \nthat he had better do so.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant thereupon resigned himself to the advice of his attorney, \ncontinuing, however, to protest that the books held by the customs authorities \nwere not true and correct books, that he had never undervalued his goods or made \nfalse declarations, and that the confession he was being induced to sign was not \ntrue and correct, and that he was signing it only because of the insistence of \nhis attorney. The testimony was uncontradicted and unchallenged.<\/p>\n<p>The document itself sets out that the defendant was requested to produce \n\"additional books and evidence to sustain the value of the invoice presented \nwith the mentioned entry.\" The entry named was No. 2613 for goods imported on \nthe steamship <em>Rubi<\/em> and not entry No. 34554, ex steamship \n<em>Taisang,<\/em> which is the importation which forms the subject matter of the \naction at bar. The evidence of Mr. Roeder, a witness for the prosecution, shows \nthat, prior to the time this alleged confession was secured, he had received \nfrom the defendant three books, one of which was introduced in evidence marked \nExhibit B. The confession, however, recites that the defendant \"thereupon . * * \n* surrendered <em>three ledgers<\/em> under statement that therein were contained \nthe correct amounts of the various purchases made by him during the last three \nyears.\" During the trial the witness Roeder admitted on cross-examination that \nthe defendant had submitted to him other books than the book Exhibit B, but that \nhe did not retain possession thereof, returning them to the accused. Exhibit B \nwas identified and designated by the court interpreter as a <em>\"book of \nmerchandise\" <\/em>and not as a <em>\"ledger\"<\/em> and the defendant testified \nthat said book was specially prepared to exhibit to customers who might haggle \nover prices and ask reductions, and for that reason contained prices highly \ninflated. The prosecution on its cross-examination elicited the information that \nthe defendant did keep <em>regular ledgers<\/em> and that they were in court at \nthat moment. They were not, however, introduced in evidence either by the \nprosecution or by the defense.<\/p>\n<p>After referring to the additional <em>three ledgers<\/em> the confession \nstated \"that the true amounts paid by him for the goods in question are those \nset forth in the three ledgers or books referred to.\" The \"goods in question\" \nrefer to those in entry No. 2613 imported on the steamship <em>Rubi<\/em> and \nthere is, therefore, in the alleged confession, no specific reference to the \nmerchandise to which the action now on trial refers.<\/p>\n<p>It thus appears that, apart from the fact that the alleged confession was \nsigned involuntarily and under protest by the accused, it lacks elements \nnecessary to make it applicable to the importation at bar and that definiteness \nwhich is required to make it effective. It must be remembered that the so-called \nconfession was made in a proceeding which had nothing to do with the importation \nat bar, and it refers, therefore, primarily to merchandise entirely distinct \nfrom that to which the present action relates. While one statement in the \nso-called confession is sufficiently broad and general to cover the importation \nat bar, the attention of the accused was not specifically drawn to that \nimportation and we doubt if we would be justified in holding that a statement so \ngeneral relative to the value of importations made during the last three years \nshould apply to the importation at bar. We regard this as particularly true when \nwe take into consideration, further, that the accused testified that the book in \nwhich the importation at bar was entered and valued was not one of his books of \ninvoice in which he entered the actual value of each importation, but was, \nrather, a book prepared by him for exhibition to customers who haggled over \nprices or who insisted on reductions before buying. Moreover, the first time \nthat the attention of the accused was specifically drawn to the valuation of the \nimportation at bar, as it appears in the book introduced by the prosecution, he \nmade express and emphatic denial of the correctness of the value therein set \nforth. In this connection also it is of some significance to note that the books \nin which the accused claims the values of importations were properly and \ncorrectly entered were called by him ledgers; whereas the book which was seized \nupon and produced in evidence by the prosecution is designated by the \ninterpreter as a \"book of merchandise.\" The confession itself refers to \n\"ledgers\" and not to \"books of merchandise\" and, from the evidence, there is \nsome question whether the book introduced by the prosecution is one of the books \nreferred to in the confession.<\/p>\n<p>We do not lose sight of the fact that, even though the book in evidence was \nnot referred to in the confession itself, it is a matter of evidence with \nrespect to the good faith of the accused in making his declaration for entry and \nof the probable correctness of the values stated therein and in the Chinese \ninvoice. Before, however, the discrepancy between the book and the declaration \nmay be held sufficient to convict, there must be evidence showing that the entry \nin the book is the true market value of the importation in the country from \nwhich it was imported and that, accordingly, the value as stated in the \ndeclaration is incorrect. The entry in the book is a matter which touches rather \nthe intention of the accused in making his declaration than the true market \nvalue of the importation. Granted that the entry in the book states the true \nmarket value of the importation, then the fact that the defendant made two \nentries, one in the book and the other in the declaration, widely at variance \nwith each other, is very strong evidence of his guilty knowledge and fraudulent \npurpose in making the declaration.<\/p>\n<p>As already stated at the outset, the prosecution to convict the accused must \nprove that the declared value was a false value and that the accused knew that \nit was false when he made the declaration. The fact that the accused made two \nentries widely different is not proof that the entry in the book is the true \nmarket value. It is simply evidence of the fact that the accused had valued the \nsame article differently at different times. That fact, however, does not prove \nthat the one or the other is the true value. To establish that fact there must \nbe additional evidence, and this is the particular thing that is lacking, so far \nas the case of the prosecution is concerned. No one has declared, no one has \ntestified, on behalf of the prosecution, what the true market value of the \nimportation was in Amoy, China. If there is any evidence of the prosecution upon \nthat subject, it is to the effect that the true market value of the importation \nin Amoy was $131.97 Amoy currency. This amount was the value liquidated by the \ncustoms authorities upon the declaration of the accused valuing the merchandise \nat $126 Amoy currency. This liquidation, however, can hardly be considered \ntestimony as to the value in the case before us. It was the duty of the \nprosecution, in establishing the falsity of the declaration, to prove the market \nvalue of the importation in the country from which it was imported. That has not \nbeen done and, accordingly, the first fundamental requisite for a conviction, \nnamely, that the declaration as to value was false, is wanting. With that the \ncase of the prosecution falls. There being no evidence of value on the part of \nthe prosecution, it is clear that the accused cannot be held to have knowingly \nmisstated it.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, the evidence of the defense in respect to the value of the \nimported merchandise is uncontradicted. It is to the effect that the value \nstated in the' declaration for entry was the correct and true market value of \nthe imported merchandise in Amoy, China, at the time of its importation. This \nevidence is uncontradicted. Moreover, it is corroborated by the other evidence \nin the case to such an extent as to support, with fair show of reason, a finding \nthat the value declared was the real value.<\/p>\n<p>With the proposition that, to convict in cases of this kind, it must be shown \nthat the accused knew that the value stated in his declaration was false, we \nshould couple the statement that knowledge may be directly proved or it may be \ninferred from, all the circumstances of the case. If the actual market value of \nthe merchandise had been proved in this case to have been that stated in Exhibit \nB, then it could have been very properly inferred that the accused knew that he \nwas misstating the value when he made the declaration.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of conviction is reversed and the accused acquitted. Costs \n<em>de officio.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres<\/em> and<em> Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><em>Johnson, J., <\/em>concurs in the result.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

The accused filed no declaration of ownership of \nthese lands until the year 1910, and they were assessed for the first time by \nthe municipal council in November of that year, though the valuation was not \nfinally determined until February, 1911, when it was definitely fixed by the \nprovincial board of tax appeals. Thereafter the accused paid the taxes assessed \nfor the year 1911, but paid no taxes for the years 1908, 1909, and 1910, during \nwhich he had held the land without declaring it for taxation as required by law. \nEarly in the year 1911, notices of delinquency relating to the unpaid taxes were \naddressed and mailed to the accused. In April, 1912, the accused took the \nelector's oath, solemnly declaring that at that time he was not delinquent in \nthe payment of taxes, although at that time he had paid no taxes on the lands in \nquestion for the years 1908, 1909, or 1910.<\/p>\n<p>Upon proof of these facts the court below convicted the accused of a \nviolation of paragraph 4 of section 30 of the Election Law (No. 1582), in that \nhe had \"knowingly taken a false oath\" before an election officer in relation to \na material fact in a registration proceeding.<\/p>\n<p>The contention of counsel for appellant would seem to be that at the time \nwhen the oath was taken no taxes had been lawfully assessed upon these lands for \nthe years 1908, 1909, and 1910, and that the notices of delinquency mailed in \nJanuary and February, 1911, were irregular and were not based on a lawful \nassessment.<\/p>\n<p>We find no merit in this contention. There can be no question as to the fact \nthat the accused was liable for the payment of the back taxes, and although the \nevidence is not wholly satisfactory as to the regularity of the assessment and \nthe delinquency notices, nevertheless we think that in the absence of \nsatisfactory proof to the contrary, there is enough evidence in the record to \nsustain a finding that these taxes were duly assessed and the accused duly \nnotified of his delinquency early in the year 1911. Moreover, where it appears, \nas it does in this case, that the owner of real estate knowingly and willfully \nneglects to make the declaration of ownership required by law, and thus avoids \nthe assessment of his land and evades the payment of taxes for which he was \njustly liable, we are of opinion that he is delinquent in the payment of such \ntaxes so as to render him guilty of perjury in the event that he takes the \nelector's oath to the contrary. While one who has duly declared his real estate \ndoes not become delinquent in the payment of the taxes thereon, so as to render \nhim liable to the payment of the penalties prescribed for delinquency, until and \nunless the lands are duly assessed and notice of the amount of the taxes has \nbeen duly furnished the land owner (U. S. <em>vs. <\/em>Labadan, 26 Phil. Rep., \n239), this rule does not apply in cases wherein the owner fails to declare his \nproperty, and thus avoids the listing and valuing of such property for purposes \nof taxation. Under the provisions of section 55 of Act No. 82, when back taxes \nare assessed in such cases \"the penalties and interest\" are added to the back \ntaxes \"as if the same had been assessed at the time when they should have been \nassessed.\"<\/p>\n<p>The judgment entered in the court below convicting and sentencing the \ndefendant and appellant should be affirmed, with the costs of this instance \nagainst the appellant.

He was \narrested and brought before the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila \ncharged with having been found in the Philippine Islands without the certificate \nof registration provided for and required by Act No. 702 of the Philippine \nCommission, although he was in the Philippine Islands at the time the Act took \neffect and has been therein continuously since that time.\n<p>The alien was duly arraigned for a hearing and was given an opportunity to \npresent the evidence provided for in sections 4 and 5 of said Act No, 702, and \nto avoid the effects of the proviso clause of section 4. After hearing the cause \nand the argument of counsel, the learned trial court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In this proceeding for deportation the only witness is the defendant. It is \nadmitted that for three years past he has been a partner in a business \nenterprise in Manila, and he testifies that before that he was an employee five \nyears. This accounts 'for his occupation back to about the close of the period \nfor registration provided by Act No. 702; and he further testifies that before \nthe close of that period he was sick. We do not think it sufficiently appears \nfrom the testimony that he continued to be a laborer until the close of the \nregistration period, and unless he did he would not be within the terms of that \nAct. The case of U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Chan Sam (17 Phil. Bep., 448), cited by the \nGovernment, applies only where the original entry was unlawful, which was not \nthe case with the defendant here. Under the rule in U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Tan Sam \nTao (15 Phil. Rep., 592), a person of defendant's present status is not subject \nto registration or deportation, and the only qualification for this which has \nbeen brought to our attention is the rule announced in the case first cited, \nwhich, as we have seen, is not applicable here. If it had been clearly shown \nthat the status of defendant was that of a laborer <em>until the close of the \nperiod of registration<\/em> it might well be that he could not escape the \nconsequences of non-registration by subsequently becoming a merchant, but, as \nalready suggested, we do not think that has been sufficiently shown, especially \nafter allowing for errors of interpretation. The presumption provided by Act No. \n702, section 5, arose only 'after the expiration' of said period.<\/p>\n<p>\"Giving the defendant, as we think we should, the benefit of all doubts, we \nfind that sufficient cause for his deportation has not been shown, and he is \ntherefore discharged.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the judgment must be reversed. From the statement \nof the court itself it appears that the alien was a laborer at the time Act No. \n702 went into effect and continued to be such for some years after the period \nfor registration under said Act closed. It is not incumbent upon the Government, \nas the trial court seems to have held, to prove affirmatively that the alien was \na laborer and should have registered under the Act. The burden is by law \nexpressly placed upon the alien to demonstrate that he was not within the class \nwhich was required by the Act to register, it being provided that \"every Chinese \n<em>person<\/em> found without such certificate in the Philippine Islands after \nthe expiration of the time limited by law for registration shall be presumed, in \nthe absence of satisfactory proof to the contrary, to be a Chinese laborer and \nshall be subject to deportation as provided in section 4 of this Act.\" (Sec. 5, \nAct No. 702.)<\/p>\n<p>We do not think that the law as to the burden of proof is changed by reason \nof the fact that the defendant is found, at the time of his apprehension, to be \na merchant. That which determines where the burden lies is the failure to have \nthe certificate and not the status of the defendant at the time of arrest. (U. \nS.<em> vs.<\/em> Lim Co, 12.Phil. Rep., 703.)<\/p>\n<p>The fact that he has recently changed his status from that of laborer to that \nof merchant does not avail him. It is the status which he enjoyed during the \nperiod for registration under Act No, 702 which determines his rights under this \nproceeding. If he was a laborer then and subject to registration, the fact that \nhe is a merchant now will not serve him. (Juan Co <em>vs. <\/em>Rafferty, 14 \nPhil. Rep., 235.)<\/p>\n<p>The alien in this case has not only failed to establish that, when the Act \nwas passed and during the time limited for registration thereunder, he was a \nmember of a class not required to be registered, but has affirmatively \ndemonstrated by his own testimony that he was a Chinese laborer at the time the \nAct took effect and that he remained such until the close of the registration \nperiod. His only excuse for not having obtained the certificate was that he was \nsick for a short time. This, however, is no excuse under the Act, for, while the \nAct extended the time for registration to those who were sick and, for that \nreason, unable to register, it still provided, nevertheless, \"that any Chinese \nlaborer failing for <em>any<\/em> reason to secure the certificate required under \nthis law within two years from the date of its passage shall be deported from \nthe Islands.\"<\/p>\n<p>Courts naturally feel a reluctance to deport from a country an individual who \nhas been a resident thereof for a period of ten years and who, in a way, has \nestablished himself as a member of the community. The statute, however, is \nplain, was passed by express authorization of Congress, and must be complied \nwith, whatever hardship may follow its application.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the alien is remanded to the \ncustody o\u00a3 the Collector of Customs for deportation.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

S. <i>vs.<\/i> Tabuyo, 19 Phil. Rep., 501.)\u00a0 Consequently, when the prosecution has proved the delinquency and the exercise of suffrage rights or of the assumption of official duties, as the case may be, it has made a<i> prima facie <\/i>case.<br\/><br\/>Under such circumstances it devolves upon the accused at least to\u00a0 raise a reasonable doubt of his knowledge of such delinquency.\u00a0 The mere assertion that he did not know of the delinquency in his\u00a0 tax payments is not sufficient to overcome the <i>prima facie <\/i>case made by the prosecution. It is a general rule that where a statute makes a specific act penal when\u00a0 knowingly done and the knowledge of the accused cannot\u00a0 be directly proved but is a matter\u00a0 of inference, it is only necessary to show that a prudent man could and would have ascertained from available sources of information, that the act complained of, under the existing circumstances, was contrary to law.\u00a0 In United States <i>vs.<\/i> Estavillo (19 Phil. Rep., 478), a number of delinquent tax- payers were charged with\u00a0 exercising their suffrage rights. Their\u00a0 defense was that when they took the elector's oath they did not knowingly [falsely] swear that their taxes had been paid,\u00a0 when as a matter of fact they were delinquent.<br\/><br\/>On the trial they gave what this court considered insufficient excuses for their lack\u00a0 of knowledge.\u00a0 It was\u00a0 held in that case that the defendant had\u00a0 not exercised due diligence in ascertaining whether or not their taxes were delinquent; and that had they done so they would have discovered the actual state of\u00a0 affairs; that\u00a0 is, that their\u00a0 taxes were delinquent.\u00a0 The court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"When it is admitted or shown, as in the case at bar, that the defendants committed the unlawful act (swearing1 that they were\u00a0 not delinquent,\u00a0 when in fact they\u00a0 were), it is presumed that they did so knowingly and intentionally. And when they seek to justify themselves by an excuse, such excuse must be\u00a0 reasonable and\u00a0 adequate.\u00a0 If it\u00a0 appears that they voluntarily\u00a0 closed their eyes to\u00a0 the truth, or negligently failed to make inquiry, then their ignorance or mistake of fact is not defense.<br\/><br\/>\" 'It may fairly be assumed that one who has reason to believe a fact exists, knows it exists.\u00a0 Certainly if he be a reasonable\u00a0 being.'\u00a0\u00a0 (Shaw <i>vs. <\/i> Railroad Co.,\u00a0 101 U.\u00a0 S., 557.)\"<\/blockquote>Conversely, if a man commits the act upon information obtained from a reliable source which would appeal to a reasonable man and cause him\u00a0 to perform the act on the strength of such information, believing that circumstances existed which rendered it lawful, he\u00a0 ought not to suffer the penalty.\u00a0\u00a0 For it is not always possible to\u00a0 make first-hand investigations of the existence of facts which are necessary to\u00a0 justify a contemplated act.\u00a0\u00a0 If\u00a0 a\u00a0 false\u00a0 report of the existence of a fact reaches a man through an agency which he has every reason to rely upon, he has a\u00a0 right to assume its existence, and cannot be said to\u00a0 <i>know<\/i> that it does not exist.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar the defendant knew that his taxes had not been paid, and was aware that the law\u00a0 made it a penal offense to take the oath of office under such circumstances. His two sons, both grown men, were preparing to start for the <i>poblacion <\/i>on Friday morning.\u00a0 He therefore gave them sufficient money to pay\u00a0 his\u00a0 taxes, together with his tax receipt for the preceding year.\u00a0 Upon arriving at the town, the brothers transacted some business.\u00a0 The elder brother met an old friend, and the two went\u00a0 a Way together\u00a0 to\u00a0 a <i> tienda<\/i> where they drank considerable <i>tuba,<\/i> becoming intoxicated.\u00a0 This was the one who carried the tax, money and who was expected to go to the municipal treasury and pay it in. The two brothers met late in the afternoon and started home. The elder brother was asked by the younger if he had paid their father's taxes and he answered in the affirmative.\u00a0 He was so intoxicated that he gave his brother very little assistance in rowing the boat on their way home.\u00a0\u00a0 They arrived home about 12 o'clock at night.\u00a0 In the meantime, their father had received a message from the municipal president requesting him to come to the municipal building the next day, Saturday, to take the oath of office. Accordingly, on Saturday morning the defendant prepared to start for town and asked his younger son if the taxes had been paid, to which the latter replied in the affirmative.\u00a0 The elder son had left home at\u00a0 daylight to gather fish.\u00a0\u00a0 On Sunday he came to his father's house and delivered over to him the tax money, stating that he had not gone to the treasurer's office on Friday at all.\u00a0 The defendant paid the tax on the next day, Monday.<br\/><br\/>These are the facts of the case as made by the united testimony of the defendant and his two sons.\u00a0 There are no inconsistencies in their testimony, their story is reasonable, and the sole ground given by the trial court for refusing to credit their declarations is that they\u00a0 are all related, and consequently interested in the\u00a0 acquittal of the defendant. But it is error to discredit the testimony of witnesses on the ground of interest alone.\u00a0\u00a0 If the testimony of an interested witness is reasonable and consistent and is not contradicted by evidence from any reliable source, we see no reason, as a general rule, for not accepting it.\u00a0 The frank confession of the defendant of his knowledge of the law making it a criminal offense for a delinquent taxpayer to qualify\u00a0 for\u00a0 an elective office, and his promptness in paying the tax on Monday, which was the first available opportunity for doing so after his eldest son informed him that it had not been\u00a0 paid, indicate to us that the did not take the oath of office knowing that his taxes were delinquent.<br\/><br\/>Upon a careful consideration of the testimony\u00a0 of record we\u00a0 conclude that the trial court did not give due weight to the testimony for\u00a0 the defendant, and that such testimony rebuts the inference that he took the oath of office knowing that his taxes were delinquent. A precedent both in the facts and law governing our decision is United States <i>vs.<\/i> Lopez (16 Phil. Rep., 416).<br\/><br\/>The defendant is therefore acquitted, with costs <i>de officio,<\/i><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C.\u00a0\u00a0 J., Carson, Moreland,<\/i>\u00a0 and<i>\u00a0 Araullo, JJ.,<\/i> concur.<\/div>",

The location \nand identity of the land are undisputed.\n<p>The admitted facts are these: Rufino Francisco acquired the land in question \nby inheritance from the registered owner. On August 20, 1909, he sold it with \nthe right to repurchase the same within one year and with the understanding that \nthe time could be extended one year more, to Vicente San Martin. This sale was \nregistered on August 26, 1909; On August 30, 1909, Francisco's right to \nrepurchase was attached by one Del Rosario. This right of repurchase was sold \nunder execution on December 29, 1909, at a sheriff's vsale, Del Rosario being \nthe purchaser. The certificate of sale was registered January 6, 1910, and \nFrancisco having failed to exercise his right of redemption within one year, the \nsheriff issued his deed to Del Rosario for the interest of Francisco in the land \nthus sold at the execution sale. This deed was registered January 27, 1911. In \nNovember or December, 1911, Del Rosario sold the land to Mariano Gonzaga. In the \nmeantime Martin appeared before the Court of Land Registration and asked that \nthe inscription in the registry of the sale to him under <em>pacto de retro<\/em> \nbe canceled for the reason that Francisco had paid him the redemption price. \nThis was done on August 22, 1910. On November 9, 1908, Francisco sold the same \nland to Jose de Lavengco. The document evidencing this sale was never \nregistered. The opponents are the widow and minor children of Jose de Lavengco. \nNeither Jose nor the opponents ever entered into the possession of the property. \nThe appellants knew nothing of the sale by Rufino Francisco to Jose de Lavengco. \nDid the appellants acquire a registerable title ?<\/p>\n<p>Section 6, paragraph 5, of Act No. 1108, section 2283 (e), Compilation, \nprovides that: \"Instruments known as <em>pacto de retro,<\/em> made under \nsections fifteen hundred and seven and fifteen hundred and twenty of the Spanish \nCivil Code in force in these Islands, may be registered under this title, and \napplication for registration thereof may be made by the owner who executed the \n<em>pacto de retro<\/em> sale under the same conditions and in the same manner as \nmortgagors are authorized to make application for registration.\"<\/p>\n<p>The right to repurchase real estate sold under <em>pacto de retro<\/em> is \nsubject to execution and may be sold at public auction to satisfy a judgment \nagainst the owner of such a right. By virtue of the sheriff's sale of December \n29, 1909, Del Rosario acquired the right to repurchase the land in question from \nMartin, In November or December, 1911, Del Rosario sold all of his interests to \nthe appellants. The only interest acquired by Del Rosario at the sheriff's sale \nwas the right to repurchase from Martin because this was the only interest that \nFrancisco had at that time. Francisco repurchased the land several months before \nDel Rosario sold his interests to the appellants. It is therefore clear that the \nappellants acquired no interest whatever in the land unless the repurchase made \nby Francisco vested the title in Del Rosario, the then owner of the right to \nrepurchase. We think that Francisco's repurchase did not have this effect. When \nFrancisco's right to repurchase was sold at public auction the judgment against \nhim was completely satisfied, and he was therefore a stranger to the \nproceedings. But it is said that under the provisions of article 1158 of the \nCivil Code the repurchase by Francisco was a payment for Del Rosario and that \nthe former may recover from the latter the price paid.<\/p>\n<p>This article reads: \"Any person, whether he has an interest or not in the \nfulfillment of the obligation, and whether the debtor knows and approves it or \nis not aware thereof, can make the payment. The person paying for the account of \nanother may recover from the debtor what he may have paid, unless he has done it \nagainst his express will. In such case he can only recover from the debtor in so \nfar as the payment has been useful to him.\"<\/p>\n<p>Del Rosario was not a debtor. He was under no obligations to repurchase the \nland from Martin. He had a right to do so but whether he exercised this right or \nnot depended upon his own volition. Article 1158 is not for these reasons \napplicable.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed, with costs against the \nappellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The will was duly probated and a committee was \nregularly appointed to hear and determine such claims against the estate as \nmight be presented. This committee submitted its report to the court on June \n27,1908. On July 14, 1908, the plaintiff, Isidoro Santos, presented a petition \nto the court asking that the committee be required to reconvene and pass upon \nhis claims against the estate which were recognized in the will of the testator. \nThis petition was denied by the court, and on November 21, 1910, the plaintiff \ninstituted the present proceedings against the administratrix of the estate to \nrecover the sums mentioned in the will as due him. Relief was denied in the \ncourt below, and he now appeals to this court.<\/p>\n<p>In his first assignment of error, the appellant takes exception to the action \nof the court in denying his petition asking that the committee be reconvened to \nconsider his claim. In support of this alleged error counsel say that it does \nnot appear in the committee's report that the publications required by section \n687 of the Code of Civil Procedure had been duly made. With reference to this \npoint the record affirmatively shows that the committee did make the \npublications required by law. It is further alleged that at the time the \nappellant presented his petition the court had not approved the report of the \ncommittee. If this were necessary we might say that, although the record does \nnot contain a formal approval of the committee's report, such approval must \nundoubtedly have been made, as will appear from an inspection of the various \norders of the court approving the annual accounts of the administratrix, in \nwhich claims allowed against the estate by the committee were written off in \naccordance with its report. This is shown very clearly from the court's order of \nAugust 1, 1912, in which the account of the administratrix was approved after \nreducing the final payments on some of the claims against the estate to agree \nwith the amounts allowed by the committee. It is further alleged that at the \ntime this petition was presented the administration proceedings had not been \nterminated. This is correct.<\/p>\n<p>In his petition of July 14, 1909, asking that the committee be reconvened to \nconsider his claims, plaintiff states that his failure to present the said \nclaims to the committee was due to his belief that it was unnecessary to do so \nbecause of the fact that the testator, in his will, expressly recognized them \nand directed that they should be paid. The inference is that had plaintiffs \nclaims not been mentioned in the will he would have presented them to the \ncommittee as a matter of course; that plaintiff was led to believe by this \nexpress mention of his claims in the will that it would be unnecessary to \npresent them to the committee; and that he did not become aware of the necessity \nof presenting them to the committee until after the committee had made its final \nreport.<\/p>\n<p>Under these facts and circumstances, did the court err in refusing to \nreconvene the committee for the purpose of considering plaintiff's claims? The \nfirst step toward the solution of this question is to determine whether \nplaintiff's claims were such as a committee appointed to hear claims against an \nestate is, by law, authorized to pass upon. Unless it was such a claim \nplaintiff's argument has no foundation. Section 686 empowers the committee to \ntry and decide claims which survive against executors and administrators, even \nthough they be demandable at a future day \"except claims for the possession of \nor title to real estate.\"Section 700 provides that all actions commenced against \nthe deceased person for the recovery of money, debt, or damages, pending at the \ntime the committee is appointed, shall be discontinued, and the claims embraced \nwithin such actions presented to the committee. Section 703 provides that \nactions to recover title to or possession of real property, actions to recover \ndamages for injury to person or property, real or personal, and actions to \nrecover the possession of specified articles of personal property, shall \nsurvive, and may be commenced and prosecuted against the executor or \nadministrator; \"but all other actions commenced against the deceased before his \ndeath shall be discontinued and the claims therein involved presented before the \ncommittee as herein provided\/' Section 708 provides that a claim secured by a \nmortgage or other collateral security may be abandoned and the claim prosecuted \nbefore the committee, or the mortgage may be foreclosed or the security be \nrelied upon, and, in the event of a deficiency judgment, the creditor may, after \nthe sale of the mortgage or upon the insufficiency of the security, prove such \ndeficiency before the committee on claims. There are also certain provisions in \nsection 746 et seq., with reference to the presentation of contingent claims to \nthe committee after the expiration of the time allowed for the presentation of \nclaims not contingent. Do plaintiff's claims fall within any of these sections? \nThey are described in the will as debts. There is nothing in the will to \nindicate that any or all of them are contingent claims, claims for the \npossession of or title to real property, damages for injury to person or \nproperty, real or personal, or for the possession of specified articles of \npersonal propety. Nor is it asserted by the plaintiff that they do. The \nconclusion is that they were claims proper to be considered by the \ncommittee.<\/p>\n<p>This being true, the next point to determine is, when and under what \ncircumstances may the committee be recalled to consider belated claims? Section \n689 provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The court shall allow such time as the circumstances of the case require for \nthe creditors to present their claims to the committee for examination and \nallowance; but not, in the first instance, more than twelve months, or less than \nsix months; and the time allowed shall be stated in the commission. The court \nmay extend the time as circumstances require, but not so that the whole time \nshall exceed eighteen months.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It cannot be questioned that this section supersedes the ordinary limitation \nof actions provided for in chapter 3 of the Code. It is strictly confined, in \nits application, to claims against the estates of deceased persons, and has been \nalmost universally adopted as part, of the probate law of the United States. It \nis commonly termed the statute of nonclaims, and. its purpose is to settle the \naffairs of the estate with dispatch, so that the residue may be delivered to the \npersons entitled thereto without their being afterwards called upon to respond \nin actions for claims, which, under the ordinary statute of limitations, have \nnot yet prescribed.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The object of the law in fixing a definite period within which claims must \nbe presented is to insure the speedy settling of the affairs of a deceased \nperson and the early delivery of the property of the estate into the hands of \nthe persons entitled to receive it.\" (Estate of De Dios, 24 Phil.Rep., \n573.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Due possibly to the comparative shortness of the period of limitation \napplying to such claims as compared with the ordinary statute of limitations, \nthe statute of nonclaims has not the finality of the ordinary statute of \nlimitations. It may be safely said that a saving provision, more or less \nliberal, is annexed to the statute of nonclaims in every jurisdiction where it \nis found. In this country its saving clause is found in section 690, which reads \nas follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"On application of a creditor who has failed to present his claim, if made \nwithin six months after the time previously limited, or, if a committee fails to \ngive the notice required by this chapter, and such application is made before \nthe final settlement of the estate, the court may, for cause shown, and on such \nterms as are equitable, renew the commission and allow further time, not \nexceeding one month, for the committee to examine such claim, in which case it \nshall personally notify the parties of the time and place of hearing, and as \nsoon as may be make the return of their doings to the court.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If the committee fails to give the notice required, that is a sufficient \ncause for reconvening it for further consideration of claims which may not have \nbeen presented before its final report was submitted to the court. But, as \nstated above, this is not the case made by the plaintiff, as the committee did \ngive the notice required by law. Where the proper notice has been given the \nright to have the committee recalled for the consideration of a belated claim \nappears to rest first upon the condition that it is presented within six months \nafter the time previously limited for the presentation of claims. In the present \ncase the time previously limited was six months from July 23, 1907. This allowed \nthe plaintiff until January 23, 1908, to present his claims to the committee. An \nextension of this time under section 690 rested in the discretion of the court. \n(Estate of De Dios, <em>supra.<\/em>) In other words, the court could extend this \ntime and recall the committee for a consideration of the plaintiff's claims \nagainst the estate if justice required it, at any time within the six months \nafter January 23, 1908, or until July 23, 1908. Plaintiff's petition was not \npresented until July 14, 1909. The bar of the statute of nonclaims is as \nconclusive under these circumstances as the bar of the ordinary statute of \nlimitations would be. It is generally held that claims are not barred as to \nproperty not included in the inventory. (Waughop <em>vs.<\/em> Bartlett, 165 \n111., 124; Estate of Reyes, 17 Phil. Rep., 188.) So also, as indicated by this \ncourt in the case last cited, fraud would undoubtedly have the same effect. \nThese exceptions to the operation of the statute are, of course, founded upon \nthe highest principles of equity. But what is the plea of the plaintiff in this \ncase? Simply this: That he was laboring under a mistake of law\u2014a mistake which \ncould easily have been corrected had he sought to inform himself; a lack of \ninformation as to the law governing the allowance of claims against estates of \ndeceased persons which, by proper diligence, could have been remedied in ample \ntime to present the claims to the committee. Plaintiff finally discovered his \nmistake and now seeks to assert his rights when they have been lost through his \nown negligence. <em>Ignorantia legis neminem excusat. <\/em>We conclude that the \nlearned trial court made no error in refusing to reconvene the committee for the \npurpose of considering plaintiff's claims against the estate.<\/p>\n<p>In his second assignment of error the appellant insists that the court erred \nin dismissing his petition filed on November 21, 1910\/ wherein he asks that the \nadministratrix be compelled to pay over to him the amounts mentioned in the will \nas debts due him. We concede all that is implied in the maxim, <em>dicat testor \net erit lex.<\/em> But the law imposes certain restrictions upon the testator, \nnot only as to the disposition of his estate, but also as to the manner in which \nhe may make such disposition. As stated in Rood on Wills, sec. 412: \"Some \ngeneral rules have been irrevocably established by the policy of the law, which \ncannot be exceeded or transgressed by any intention of the testator, be it ever \nso clearly expressed.\"<\/p>\n<p>It may be safely asserted that no respectable authority can be found which \nholds that the will of the testator may override positive provisions of law and \nimperative requirements of public policy. (Page on Wills, sec; 461.)<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Impossible conditions and those contrary to law and good morals shall be \nconsidered as not imposed, * * *\" (Art. 792, Civil Code.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Conceding for the moment that it was the testator's desire in the present \ncase that the debts listed by him in his will should be paid without referring \nthem to a committee appointed by the court, can such a provision be enforced? \nMay the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to the settlement of \nclaims against an estate by a committee appointed by the court be superseded by \nthe contents of a will?<\/p>\n<p>It is evident from the brief outline of the sections referred to above that \nthe Code, of Civil Procedure has established a system for the allowance of \nclaims against the estates of decedents. There are at least two restrictions \nimposed by law upon the power of the testator to dispose of his property, and \nwhich <em>pro tanto<\/em> restrict the maxim that \"the will of the testator is \nlaw:\" (1) His estate is liable for all legal obligations incurred by him; and \n(2) he can not dispose of or encumber the legal portion due his heirs by force \nof law.<\/p>\n<p>The former take precedence over the latter. (Sec. 640, Code Civ. Proc.) In \ncase his estate is sufficient they must be paid. (Sec. 734, id.) In case the \nestate is insolvent they must be paid in the order named in section 735. It is \nhardly necessary to say that a provision in an insolvent's will that a certain \ndebt be paid would not entitle it to preference over other debtsi But, if the \nexpress mention of a debt in the will requires the administrator to pay it \nwithout reference to the committee, what assurance is there, in the case of an \ninsolvent estate, that it will not take precedence over preferred debts?<\/p>\n<p>If it is unnecessary to present such a claim to the committee, the statute of \nnonclaims is not applicable. It is not barred until from four to ten years, \naccording1 to its classification in chapter 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \nestablishing limitations upon actions. Under such circumstances, when may the \nlegal portion be determined ? If, in the meantime, the estate has been \ndistributed, what security have the distributees against the interruption of \ntheir possession? Is the administrator required to pay the amount stipulated in \nthe will regardless of its correctness? And, if not, what authority has he to \nvise the claim? Section 706 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that an \nexecutor may, with the approval of the court, compound with a debtor of deceased \nfor a debt due the estate. But he is nowhere permitted or directed to deal with \na creditor of the estate. On the contrary, he is the advocate of the estate \nbefore an impartial committee with quasi-judicial power to determine the amount \nof the claims against the estate, and, in certain cases, to equitably adjust the \namounts due. The administrator, representing the debtor estate, and the creditor \nappear before this body as parties litigant and, if either is dissatisfied with \nits decision, an appeal to the court is their remedy. To allow the administrator \nto examine and approve a claim against the estate would put him in the dual roIe \nof a claimant and judge. The law in this jurisdiction has been so framed that \nthis may not occur. The most important restriction, in this jurisdiction, on the \ndisposition of property by will are those provisions of the Civil Code providing \nfor the preservation of the legal portions due to heirs by force of law, and \nexpressly recognized arid continued in force by sections 614, 684, and 753 of \nthe Code of Civil Procedure. But if a debt expressly recognized in the will must \nbe paid without its being verified, there is nothing to prevent a partial or \ntotal alienation of the legal portion by means of a bequest under the guise of a \ndebt, since all of the latter must be paid before the amount of the legal \nportion can be determined. <\/p>\n<p>We are aware that in some jurisdictions executors and administrators are, by \nlaw, obligated to perform the duties which, in this jurisdiction, are. assigned \nto the committee on claims; that in some other jurisdictions it is the probate \ncourt itself that performs these duties; that in some jurisdictions the \nlimitation upon the presentment of claims for allowance is longer and, possibly, \nin some shorter; and that there is a great divergence in the classification of \nactions which survive and actions which do not survive the death of the \ntestator. It must be further remembered that there are but few of the United \nStates which provide for heirs by force of law. These differences render useless \nas authorities in this jurisdiction many of the cases coming from the United \nStates. The restriction imposed upon the testator's power to dispose of his \nproperty when there are heirs by force of law is especially important. The \nrights of these heirs by force of law pass immediately upon the death of the \ntestator. (Art. 657, Civil Code.) The state intervenes and guarantees their \nrights by many stringent provisions of law to the extent mentioned in article \n818 of the Civil Code. Having undertaken the responsibility to deliver the legal \nportion of the net assets of the estate to the heirs by force of law, it is idle \nto talk of substituting for the procedure provided by law for determining the \nlegal portion, some other procedure provided in the will of the testator. The \nstate cannot afford to allow the performance of its obligations to be directed \nby the will of an individual. There is but one instance in which the settlement \nof the estate according to the probate procedure provided in the Code of Civil \nProcedure, may be dispensed with, and it applies only to <em>intestate<\/em> \nestates. (Sec. 596, Code Civ. Proc.) A partial exemption from the lawful \nprocedure is also contained in section 644, when the executor or administrator \nis the sole residuary legatee. Even in such case, and although the testator \ndirects that no bond be given, the executor is required to give a bond for the \npayment of the debts of the testator. The facts of the present case do not bring \nit within either of these sections. We conclude that the claims against the \nestate in the case at bar were enforceable only when the prescribed legal \nprocedure was followed.<br\/><br\/>But we are not disposed to rest our conclusion \nupon this phase of the case entirely upon legal grounds. On the contrary we are \nstrongly of the opinion that the application of the maxim, \"The will of the \ntestator is the law of the case,\" but strengthens our position so far as the \npresent case is concerned.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It will ordinarily be presumed in construing a will that the testator is \nacquainted with the rules of law, and that he intended to comply with them \naccordingly. If two constructions of a will or a part thereof are possible, and \none of these constructions is consistent with the law, and the other is \ninconsistent, the presumption that the testator intended to comply with the law \nwill compel that construction which is consistent with the law to be adopted.\" \n(Page on Wills, sec, 465.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Aside from this legal presumption, which we believe should apply in the \npresent case as against any construction of the will tending to show an \nintention of the testator that the ordinary legal method of probating claims \nshould be dispensed with, it must be remembered that the testator knows that the \nexecution of his will in no way affects his control over his property. The dates \nof his will and of his death may be separated by a period of time more or less \nappreciable. In the meantime, as the testator well knows, he may acquire or \ndispose of property, pay or assume additional debts, etc. In the absence of \nanything to the contrary, it is only proper to presume that the testator, in his \nwill, is treating of his estate at the time and in the condition it is in at his \ndeath. Especially is this true of his debts. Debts may accrue and be paid in \nwhole or in part between the time the will is made and the death of the \ntestator. To allow a debt mentioned in the will in the amount expressed therein \non the ground that such was the desire of the testator, when, in fact, the debt \nhad been wholly or partly paid, would be not only unjust to the residuary heirs, \nbut a reflection upon the good sense of the testator himself. Take the present \ncase for example. It would be absurd to say that the testator knew what the \namount of his just debts would be at a future and uncertain date. A mere \ncomparison of the list of creditors of the testator and the amounts due them as \ndescribed in his will, with the same list and the amounts allowed by the \ncommittee on claims, shows that the testator had creditors at the time of his \ndeath not mentioned in the will at all. In other instances the amounts due these \ncreditors were either greater or less than the amounts mentioned as due them in \nthe will. In fact, of those debts listed in the will, not a single one was \nallowed by the committee in the amount named in the will. This shows that the \ntestator either failed to list in his will all his creditors and that, as to \nthose he did include, he set down an erroneous amount opposite their names; or \nelse, which is the only reasonable view of the matter, he overlooked some debts \nor contracted new ones after the will was made and that as to others he did \ninclude he made partial payments on some and incurred additional indebtedness as \nto others. <\/p>\n<p>While the testator expresses the desire that his debts be paid, he also \nexpressly leaves the residue of his estate, in equal parts, to his children. Is \nit to be presumed that he desired to overpay some of his creditors \nnotwithstanding his express instructions that his own children should enjoy the \nnet assets of his estate after the debts were paid? Again, is the net statement \nof the amount due some of his creditors and the omission altogether of some of \nhis other creditors compatible with his honorable and commendable desire, so \nclearly expressed in his will, that all his debts be punctually paid? We cannot \nconceive that such conflicting ideas were present in the testator's mind when he \nmade his will. <\/p>\n<p>Again, suppose the testator erroneously charged himself with a debt which he \nwas under no legal or even moral obligation to pay. The present case suggests, \nif it does not actually present, such a state of affairs. Among the assets of \nthe estate mentioned in the will is a parcel of land valued at P6,500; while in \nthe inventory of the administratrix the <em>right to repurchase<\/em> this land \nfrom one Isidoro Santos is listed as an asset. Counsel for the administratrix \nalleges that he is prepared to prove that this is the identical plaintiff in the \ncase at bar; that the testator erroneously claimed the fee of this land in his \nlast will and stated Santos' rights in the same as a mere debt due him of \nP5,000; that, in reality, the only asset of the testator in regard to this land \nwas the value of the right to repurchase, while the ownership of the land, \nsubject only to that right of redemption, belonged to Santos; that the right to \nrepurchase this land expired in 1907, after the testator's death. Assuming, \nwithout in the least asserting, that such are the underlying facts of this case, \nthe unjust consequences of holding that a debt expressly mentioned in the will \nmay be recovered without being presented to the committee on claims, is at once \napparent. In this supposed case, plaintiff needed only wait until the time for \nredemption of the land had expired, when he would have acquired an absolute \ntitle to the land, and could also have exacted the redemption price. Upon such a \nstate of facts, the one item of ?5,000 would be a mere fictitious debt, and as \nthe total net value of the estate was less than p15,000, the legal portion of \nthe testator's children would be consumed in part in the payment of this item. \nSuch a case cannot occur if the prescribed procedure is followed of requiring \nthat such claims be visaed by the committee on claims.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The direction in the will for the executor to pay all just debts does not \nmean that he shall pay them without probate. There is nothing in the will to \nindicate that the testator intended that his estate should be administered in \nany other than the regular way under the statute, which requires 'all demands \nagainst the estates of deceased persons,' 'all such demands as may be \nexhibited,' etc. The statute provides the very means for ascertaining whether \nthe claims against the estate are just debts.\" (Kaufman <em>vs.<\/em> Redwine, 97 \nArk., 546.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>See also Collamore <em>vs.<\/em> Wilder (19 Kan., 67); O'Neil <em>vs.<\/em> \nFreeman (45 N. J. L., 208).<\/p>\n<p>The petition of the plaintiff filed on November 21, 1910, wherein he asks \nthat the administratrix be compelled to pay over to him the amounts mentioned in \nthe will as debts due him appears to be nothing more nor less than a complaint \ninstituting an action against the administratrix for the recovery of the sum of \nmoney. Obviously, the plaintiff is not seeking possession of or title to real \nproperty or specific articles of personal property.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When a committee is appointed as herein provided, no action or suit shall be \ncommenced or prosecuted against the executor or administrator upon a claim \nagainst the estate to recover a debt due from the estate; but actions to recover \nthe seizing and possession of real estate and personal chattels claimed by the \nestate may be commenced against him.\" (Sec. 699, Code Civ. \nProc.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The sum of money prayed for in the complaint must be due the plaintiff either \nas a debt or a legacy. If it is a debt, the action was erroneously instituted \nagainst the administratrix. Is it a legacy?<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff's argument at this \npoint becomes obviously inconsistent. Under his first assignment of error he \nalleges that the committee on claims should have been reconvened to pass upon \nhis claim against the estate. It is clear that this committee has nothing to do \nwith legacies. It is true that a debt may be left as a legacy, either to the \ndebtor (in which case it virtually amounts to a release), or to a third person. \nBut this case can only arise when the debt is an asset of the estate. It would \nbe absurd to speak of a testator's leaving a bare legacy of his own debt. (Arts. \n866, 878, Civil Code.)<br\/>The creation of a legacy depends upon the will of the \ntestator, is an act of pure beneficence, has no binding force until his death, \nand may be avoided in whole or in part by the mere whim of the testator, prior \nto that time. A debt arises from an obligation recognized by law (art. 1089, \nCivil Code) and once established, can only be extinguished in a lawful manner. \n(Art. 1156, id.) Debts are demandable and must be paid in legal tender. Legacies \nmay, and often do, consist of specific articles of personal property and must be \nsatisfied accordingly. In order to collect as a legacy the sum mentioned in the \nwill as due him, the plaintiff must show that it is in fact a legacy and not a \ndebt. As he has already attempted to show that this sum represents a debt, it is \nan anomaly to urge now it is a legacy.<\/p>\n<p>Was it the intention of the testator to leave the plaintiff a legacy of \nP7,454? We have already touched upon this question. Plaintiff's claim is \ndescribed by the testator as a debt. It must be presumed that he used this \nexpression in its ordinary and common acceptation; that is, a legal liability \nexisting in favor of the plaintiff at the time the will was made, and demandable \nand payable in legal tender. Had the testator desired to leave a legacy to the \nplaintiff, he would have done so in appropriate language instead of including it \nin a statement of what he owed the plaintiff, the decedent's purpose in listing \nhis debts in his will is set forth in the fourth clause of the will, quoted \nabove. There is nothing contained in that clause which indicates, even remotely, \na desire to pay his creditors more than was legally due them.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A construction leading to a legal, just and sensible result is presumed to \nbe correct, as against one leading to an illegal, unnatural, or absurd effect.\" \n(Rood on Wills, sec. 426.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The testator, in so many words, left the total net assets of his estate, \nwithout reservation of any kind, to his children per capita. There is no \nindication that he desired to leave anything by way of legacy to any other \nperson. These considerations clearly refute the suggestion that the testator \nintended to leave plaintiff anything by way of a legacy. His claim against the \nestate having been a simple debt, the present action was improperly instituted \nagainst the administratrix. (Sec. 699, Code Civ. Proc.)<\/p>\n<p>But it is said that the plaintiff's claims should be considered as partaking \nof the nature of a legacy and disposed of accordingly. If this be correct then \nthe plaintiff would receive nothing until after all the debts had been paid and \nthe heirs by force of law had received their shares. From any point of view the \ninevitable result is that there must be a hearing sometime before some tribunal \nto determine the correctness of the debts recognized in the wills of deceased \npersons. This hearing, in the first instance, can not be had before the court \nbecause the law does not authorize it. Such debtors must present their claims to \nthe committee, otherwise their claims will be forever barred.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons the orders appealed from are affirmed, with costs \nagainst the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Carson,<\/em> and<em> Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" no=\"\" shade=\"\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<p><\/p>\n<div align=\"center\">DISSENTING <\/div>\n<p><strong>MORELAND, J.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The decision of the court in this case produces, in my humble opinion, a \nserious miscarriage of justice. It causes the appellant to lose more than \nP7,000, a debt against the respondent estate, which debt, but a few months \nbefore his death, was specifically recognized by the testator in his will as a \ndebt due and owing to petitioner and which he, in said will, ordered and \ndirected his executor to pay \"religiously.\"<\/p>\n<p>If I could find justification for such a decision either in the proceedings \nas they are unfolded by the record or in the law as laid down in the Code of \nCivil Procedure, I would, of course, acquiesce. Far from finding such \njustification, I am met, so far as my judgment can discern, with facts of record \nwhich demonstrate conclusively that the decision is erroneous in fact.<\/p>\n<p>The opinion seeks to demonstrate that a creditor, whose claim is recognized \nby the highest possible authority, the debtor himself, in the most solemn \ninstrument known to the law, his last will and testament, as legal, just and \nvalid, must lose that claim <em>because the validity thereof has not been \nestablished by a committee.<\/em> And this in spite of the fact that, upon the \nrecord of the case, no one interested in the estate disputes the claim or \nchallenges its validity. Take this proposition in connection with the fact that \nthe committee to hear claims has not been discharged, that the estate has not \nbeen finally closed but is still pending settlement, and that, therefore, there \nexists not a single reason, in equity or justice, why the claimant should not be \npermitted to present his claim, if that is necessary, and we have before us a \nsituation which indicates how far the decision has gone.<\/p>\n<p>It should be carefully observed that the petitioner Isidoro Santos, was \ndefeated in this litigation upon the ground, <em>and the sole ground,<\/em> that \nhe did not present his claim to the committee, in pursuance of a notice to \ncreditors published under an order dated <em>July 23,1907,<\/em> and that he, \ntherefore, lost the right to enforce the claim; that the notice having been \npublished from <em>July 25,1907,<\/em> to <em>August 16,1907,<\/em> petitioner's \napplication on July 14, 1909, for the extension of time for the presentation of \nclaims to the old committee or the appointment of a new committee for that \npurpose, was too late and was properly denied, and that his motion made November \n21, 1909, praying that the executor be compelled to carry out the wishes of the \ntestator and pay the claim, was also properly denied.<\/p>\n<p>In my judgment the decision is erroneous from whatever point viewed:<\/p>\n<p>1. Even if it be assumed that the notice to creditor should have been \npublished in accordance with the order of July 23, 1907, the record is entirely \nlacking in legal evidence to establish the publication which the law requires \nunder that order. That being so the claim is not barred.<\/p>\n<p>2. I contend, and the record shows, that the notice should not have been \npublished in accordance with the order of July 23, 1907, but in pursuance of the \norder of January 8, 1908, which was an order for a new publication, and, being a \nlater order, necessarily vacated and annulled the order of July 23, 1907, and \nall proceedings thereunder relative to the matters included in said order of \n<em>January 8, 1908;<\/em> that publication was concededly never made under and \nin pursuance of that order and that, for that reason, the petitioner's claim is \nnot barred.<\/p>\n<p>3. The claim was not one that must be submitted to a committee, being \nrecognized as a legal and valid debt by the will and the testator having ordered \nhis executor to pay it. The motion made to require the executor to pay the claim \nshould have been heard by the court.<\/p>\n<p>The facts of this case, as shown by the record, are:<\/p>\n<p>Don Lucas de Ocampo made a will July 26, 1906. He died November 18,1906. The \nwill specifically named Isidoro Santos, the petitioner, a creditor of the \ntestator, set out the specific amount due him, named an executor, and directed \nhim to pay the claim \"religiously.\"<\/p>\n<p>The will was probated July 15, 1907, and Leandra Manarang, the widow, \nappointed temporary administratrix. Her administration was terminated on July \n23, 1907, and Cosme Naval, the person named in the will as executor, was, on \nthat date, duly appointed executor. On the same day Pedro Abad Santos and Marcos \nTancuaco were named the committee of appraisal and to hear claims presented \nagainst the estate, the court making the following order: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"There having been heard the petition presented by Senor Cosme Naval, praying \nthat he be appointed executor of the above named estate as provided in the will \nof the deceased Lucas de Ocampo; and also praying the appointment of a committee \nof appraisal consisting of Senores Pedro Abad Santos and Marcos Tancuaco:<\/p>\n<p>\"It is ordered that the said Cosme Naval may be and he hereby is appointed \nexecutor of the will of Lucas de Ocampo, deceased, the clerk being authorized to \nissue in favor of said Cosme Naval letters testamentary, the petitioner being \nfirst required to take the oath prescribed by law and to file a bond in the sum \nof P500 Philippine currency, with two sureties satisfactory to the court.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is also ordered that the special letters of administration issued \ntemporarily in favor of the widow of the deceased, Leandra Manarang, remain \nwithout effect from this day.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is further ordered that Se\u00f1ores <em>Pedro Abad Santos<\/em> and Marcos \nTancuaco be and they hereby are appointed the committee of appraisal and claims \nof this estate.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On the 28th of September, 1907, Naval was removed from office and Leandra \nManarang named in his place. On December 3, same year, Pedro Abad Santos \nresigned from the committee to become the attorney for the estate and Donato \nIturralde was appointed in his stead.<\/p>\n<p>Following these changes both in the office of executor and in that of the \ncommittee, on January 8, 1908, the court made an order which, in itself, is, in \nmy judgment, a complete refutation of the decision in this case and demonstrates \nthat a contrary judgment should have been rendered.<\/p>\n<p>That order, dated, as I have said, on January 8, 1908, and promulgated on \nthat day, reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Whereas, the Hon. Julio Llorente, in decree dated December 3, 1907, \nappointed Se\u00f1or Donato Iturralde, a resident of this city, to the office of \ncommittee of appraisal in the above-entitled proceeding:<\/p>\n<p>\"Therefore, and in compliance with the above-mentioned decree, Senor Donato \nIturralde, a resident of this city, is appointed a member of the committee of \nappraisal and to hear the claims that may be presented against the property of \nthis estate, which committee within thirty days from the date of said decree \nshall deliver a copy of the inventory to this court and another to the \nadministratrix Senora Leandra Manarang, and within sixty days shall post $ \nnotice at the main door of this courthouse and in three public places in the \nmunicipality where the property of the said deceased is located, in which shall \nbe stated the dates and places when and where the meetings of the committee will \nbe held and notifying the creditors that they should present their claims within \nsix months counting from the date of said notice; said notice, furthermore, to \nbe published during three consecutive weeks in the newspaper 'El Imparcial,' \nhaving general circulation in this province.<\/p>\n<p>\"Given today, the 8th of January, 1908, by order of the Hon. Julio Llorente, \nJudge of the Fourth Judicial District and of this Province of \nPampanga.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On July 14, 1908, the committee filed a report, the only report in the \nrecord, in which appears the following statement :<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The undersigned, committee of appraisal and claims against the above estate, \npresents to the court the following list of all the claims presented against the \nsaid estate since the <em>25th of July, 1907, on which date the first \npublication to creditors was made.\"<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The publication under which the committee was reporting was begun under the \norder of <em>July 23, 1907,<\/em> which was vacated and annulled by the order of \nJanuary 8,1908, which, by reason of the changes in the offices of executor and \ncommittee, ordered <em>a new and different notice to creditors.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>On July 14, 1909, petitioner herein made an application to the court to \nreopen the sessions of the committee and permit him to present the claim \nmentioned in the will. This was denied November 27, 1909, the court simply \nsaying:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This cause having been heard and the parties having presented their \narguments, the motion is denied by reason of the lapse of \ntime.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On November 21, 1910, the petitioner moved the court that, the testator \nhaving recognized and legalized the debt in his will and having ordered his \nexecutor to pay the same to the petitioner, said executor be ordered and \ndirected to pay said claim to the petitioner pursuant to the testator's \ndirections. This motion was denied April 26,1911,<em> upon the same ground as \nthe other motion.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The appeal is from both of these orders and brings up so much of the record \nas is pertinent to these questions.<\/p>\n<p>The court has held on this appeal: <\/p>\n<p>1. That the motion last mentioned is <em>an action.<\/em> The opinion says: \n\"The petition of the plaintiff filed on November 21, 1910, * * * appears to be \nnothing more or less than a complaint instituting an action against the \nadministratrix for the recovery of the sum of money.\" After discussing this \nphase of the case the court concludes: \"His claim against the estate having been \na simple debt, the present action was improperly instituted against the \nadministratrix (sec. 699, Code Civ. Proc.).\" This is one of the grounds of the \ndecision.<\/p>\n<p>2. That the recognition of the debt in the will and the direction of the \ntestator to pay the same have no significance in law.<\/p>\n<p>3. That, notwithstanding this recognition and direction, the claim should \nhave been presented to the committee appointed to hear and determine claims \nagainst the estate.<\/p>\n<p>4. That the claim was not presented to the committee. <\/p>\n<p>5. That all of the formalities required by law relative to the notice to the \ncreditors to present their claims were fully observed, the court saying that \n\"the record affirmatively shows that the committee did make the publications \nrequired by law.\"<\/p>\n<p>6. That the court below did not err in denying the motion to extend the time \nof the old committee or appoint a new one to the end that the claim in question \nmight be presented.<\/p>\n<p>7. That the court did not err in denying the motion to compel the executor to \npay the claim in pursuance of the direction contained in the will.<\/p>\n<p>Laying aside for a moment those holdings of the court which declare that the \nclaim is one which must be presented to and passed upon by a committee, I am \ncompelled to differ from every other proposition and statement of fact appearing \nin the decision pertinent to the issue involved, except the single one that the \nclaim was not presented to a committee. That it was not presented is conceded; \nindeed, the fact that it was not is the whole cause of this proceeding.<\/p>\n<p>I am compelled to believe that the statement of the decision that \"the record \naffirmatively shows that the committee did make the publications required by \nlaw,\" is not quite inaccordance with the record as I read it.<\/p>\n<p>The opinion does not refer me to any evidence of record which supports its \nstatement. Where is this evidence, where is this record which \"affirmatively \nshows?\" I have been unable to find it. Here is all of the evidence, if it may be \ncalled evidence, which I am able to find in the record relative to the \npublication of the notices to creditors:<\/p>\n<p>(<em>a<\/em>) An affidavit of the publisher of \"El Imparcial\" setting out that \nthe notice to creditors attached to the affidavit and signed by <em>Pedro Abad \nSantos<\/em> (who, before the completion of the publication, resigned) and Marcos \nTancuaco, dated July 23, <em>1907,<\/em> was published \"three weeks from the 25th \nof July to the 16th of August, <em>1907.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The notice referred to is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The undersigned committee of appraisal hereby notifies the creditors of \nLucas de Ocampo, deceased, and all other persons who have claims against the \nestate of said deceased, to present the same with vouchers within six months \nfrom the date of this notice to the committee, every Monday, between 4 and 5 \no'clock p. m., at the dwelling house of <em>Pedro A. Santos,<\/em> Sagasta \nStreet, San Fernando, Pampanga. Dated San Fernando, Pampanga, P. I., July 23, \n1907. Signed: Pedro Abad Santos, committee. Marcos Tancuaco, \ncommittee.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The defectiveness of the affidavit is apparent. It does not show whether the \nnewspaper was daily, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly, or the day of the week or \nmonth on which published. It does not show that the notice was published three \nweeks <em>successively,<\/em> that is, <em>once each week<\/em> for three \nsuccessive weeks, as required by law and the owJer of the court. So ambiguous is \nit that is might mean that the notice was published once, namely, three weeks \nfrom July 25. Passing, however, these defects, I note that the notice to \ncreditors requires them to present their claims at the <em>dwelling house of \nPedro Abad Santos.<\/em> It should be noted, as before stated, that this \ncommissioner resigned before the expiration of the six months, thus making it \nnecessary for creditors to present their claims <em>and their proofs \nthereof<\/em> to one who was not a member of the committee and to a man who, \nimmediately on. his resignation, <em>became the attorney of the estate.<\/em> \nThis will become important when we later discuss the significance of the fact \nthat the court, as already seen, on January 8, <em>1908,<\/em> <em>made a new \norder<\/em> requiring that a new notice be given to creditors, <em>to be \npublished thereafter,<\/em> thereby revoking the order of July 23, 1907, and \nannulling the notice to creditors above set out and then in course of \npublication.<\/p>\n<p>(<em>b<\/em>) The remaining item of evidence which it is claimed tends to show \nthat the notice to creditors was duly published is the reference made by the \ncommissioners in their report to the court, above quoted, in which they say, \nreferring to July 25, 1907, \"on which date the first publication to creditors \nwas made.\"<\/p>\n<p>This reference cannot be called evidence of publication, although the court \naccepts it as such. At most it refers and is limited, in terms, to the first \npublication. It has riot the slightest reference to the other publications, if \nany.<\/p>\n<p>This, (<em>a<\/em>) and (<em>b<\/em>), is all the evidence in the whole record \nrelative to the publication of the notice to creditors. Admitting it all to be \ntrue and giving it all the weight possible, does it establish \"affirmatively \nthat the committee did make the publications required by law?\" I am of the \nopinion not. The law requires, in addition to the publication in the newspapers, \nthat \"the committee * * * shall post a notice in four public places in the \nprovince stating the times and places of their meetings, and the time limited \nfor creditors to present their claims * * *\" and give such other notice as the \ncourt directs.<\/p>\n<p>Where is there in the record evidence showing that this was done? Nowhere. As \nI read the record, there is not a syllable of such evidence in all the case.<\/p>\n<p>I, therefore, am forced to the conclusion that the declaration of the court \nthat \"the record affirmatively shows that the committee did make the \npublications required by law\" is without sufficient evidence to support it. <\/p>\n<p>After a thorough reading of the record, I am reluctantly forced to a further \nconclusion, namely, that instead of there being evidence in the case showing the \npublication required by law, there is evidence showing the precise contrary. \n<\/p>\n<p>Let us remember that the first order of the court directing the committee to \npublish notice to creditors was issued <em>July 23, 1907<\/em>. It is conceded \nthat publication <em>in a newspaper<\/em> of some sort was started<em> under that \norder.<\/em> But, the court, evidently becoming satisfied that, under all the \ncircumstances, the publication under that order would not be sufficient to give \ncreditors fair notice, on <em>January 8, 1908,<\/em> and before the publication \nunder the first order, if there was ever started in reality a publication under \nthat order, was completed, made a <em>second order of publication.<\/em> The \nreason for this order was evidently that, during the six months succeeding the \ndate of the notice which it is claimed was published under the first order, \nthree persons held the office of executor, the complexion of the committee \nitself was changed, and the member of the committee at whose house the notice \nrequired the claims and vouchers to be presented resigned from the committee \nand<em> became the attorney for the estate.<\/em> Pedro Abad Santos having ceased \nto be a member of the committee and having become attorney for the estate, and \nthe notice to the creditors requiring that claims With their vouchers be \npresented <em>at his house,<\/em> there was no longer a proper place designated \nwhere creditors could present their claims. Furthermore, the continual change in \nthe executorship already noted may have resulted in grave prejudice to the \nestate if the estate were to be held responsible for all claims presented during \nthe time those changes were taking place, it being the duty of the executor, \nunder the law, to be present at the hearing on claims and defend the estate \nagainst those which he deemed unjust, and the frequent change in the office, \nthereby bringing in persons unfamiliar with what had gone before, certainly not \ntending to efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>All these facts, taken in connection with the defectiveness of the affidavit \nof the publication of the notice, and the fact that there was no posting of the \nnotices as required by law, that the notice itself was defective in that it \nrequired the claims to be presented within six months from the <em>date of the \nnotice<\/em> instead of the <em>date of the last publication<\/em> thereof, as the \nlaw, properly interpreted, requires, all these facts, I say, undoubtedly led the \ncourt to believe that the previous proceedings relative to claims should be \nannulled and that a new order of publication should be made. Accordingly, on \nJanuary 8, 1908, as aforesaid, an order was made and entered as above set forth, \nrequiring a <em>new publication<\/em> by a <em>new committee.<\/em> This order had \nthe effect, of course, of vacating and annulling the previous order covering the \nsame subject matter.<br\/><br\/><em>It is undisputed that no publication has ever \nbeen made or even attempted under this order of January 8,1908.<\/em> The only \npublication referred to in the record or in the opinion in this case is that \nunder the order of <em>July 23, 1907. <\/em>No one contends that any other \npublication has ever been made or attempted.<\/p>\n<p>That this order of January 8, 1908, was considered the governing order in the \ncase and that it was an annullment of all prior proceedings and orders relative \nto the same subject matter, is clear. If notice had been given as provided by \nthat order, the six months' term, according to the order, would have expired \nsome time in July, 1908. This, of course, was clearly understood by the court, \nand we find the court, ever anxious to have the estate settled as quickly as \npossible under the law, making the following order on the the 2d day of April, \n1908:<\/p>\n<p>\"It is hereby ordered that the administratrix present her inventory before \nthe 1st day of May and the committee its report within the time provided by law, \nand that the administratrix present her account before the 1st day of August, \n1908.\"'<\/p>\n<p>This order demonstrates conclusively that the court believed that the \ncommittee was giving the notice to creditors as provided by the order of \n<em>January 8, 1908,<\/em> and not that of July 23, 1907; for, if the notice was \nto be given under the latter and the publication began July 25, 1907, then the \ntime within which the committee was to report expired in January, 1908 (see \nopinion), long before the order of April 2, 1908, was issued (Code Civ. Proc, \nsec. 693) and the requirement therein that the committee report \"within the time \nprovided by law\" was idle. The court evidently believed that notice was being \npublished under the order of January 8, 1908, that the six months' period would \nexpire in July, that the committee could therefore report to the administratrix \nthe number and amounts of the claims presented and allowed, and that she could, \ntherefore, render her account before the 1st day of August, as in the order of \nApril 2 required. This order is strictly inconsistent from every point of view \nwith the idea that the order of July 23, 1907, was in force and that publication \nof the notice to creditors was proceeding thereunder.<\/p>\n<p>I, therefore, say that the record demonstrates not only that the declaration \nof the court that \"the record affirmatively shows that the committee did make \nthe publications required by law\" is without sufficient foundation in fact, but \nalso that the contrary is true, namely, that no publication was ever made under \nthe only order under which it could be legally made.<\/p>\n<p>I contend, furthermore, that this proceeding is not an action against an \nexecutor to recover a debt against the estate of his testator. The decision of \nthe court that it is an action and not being one of those which, under the Code, \ncan be brought against an executor and must be dismissed for that reason is, in \nmy judgment, erroneous. I do not understand how a motion to compel an executor \nto comply with the directions in a will can be called an action to recover a \ndebt in the sense that such motion is prohibited by law.<\/p>\n<p>Dealing with the second branch of the case, wherein the court holds that the \ndebt should have been presented to a committee;<\/p>\n<p>The proposition that a debt which is recognized by the highest possible \nauthority, the debtor himself, in the most solemn instrument known to the law \nand the one whose provisions are the most sacredly carried out by the courts, \nhis last will and testament, which debt the testator, in his will, expressly \nordered his executor to pay to the creditor by name, must be presented to the \ncommittee for them to determine whether it is a valid claim and whether it ought \nto be paid, is a proposition which appeals neither to my reason nor my sense of \njustice. There is no statute expressly requiring such presentation. There is \nnone which by necessary implication requires it. To bring such a debt within the \nlaw requiring presentation to the committee, interpretation and construction \nmust be invoked to such an extent as to shock if not violate the ordinary canons \napplicable thereto. This is particularly true when such interpretation and \nconstruction are resorted to to deprive a creditor of a claim, the validity and \njustice of which is not only undisputed but unquestioned.<\/p>\n<p>There is no provision of the Code of Civil Procedure <em>expressly<\/em> \nrequiring the presentation of <em>any<\/em> claim to a committee. Provision is \nmade for the appointment of a committee which is authorized to hear certain \nclasses of claims but nowhere is there an express provision requiring a creditor \nto present his claim. There is, to be sure, a section which provides (sec. 695) \nthat if a creditor fails to present his claim, if it is a certain kind of claim, \nwithin the time provided in the law, it will be barred. It is, therefore, \ngathered by implication that every creditor having a certain kind of claim must \npresent it; but there is no provision <em>expressly<\/em> requiring it. Moreover, \nit must be carefully noted that only <em>certain<\/em> claims need to be \npresented to the committee and that only certain claims are barred provided they \nare not exhibited. Section 686 confers upon the committee whatever jurisdiction \nit may have with respect to the hearing of claims, apart from those upon which \nactions were begun against decedent in his lifetime. It provides that \"they may \ntry and decide upon claims, <em>which by law survive against executors or \nadministrators,<\/em> except claims for the possession of or title to real \nestate;\" and under section 695 only those claims are barred which are \n<em>\"proper to be allowed by the committee.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We see then that the committee is authorized to take jurisdrction over those \nclaims only which survive against an executor or administrator. The code does \nnot define or declare \"what claims survive against executors or administrators.\" \nIt refers to certain <em>actions<\/em> which, having been commenced by the \ndeceased in his lifetime, may be continued after his death fry his executor or \nadministrator. It nowhere tells us \"what claims survive against executors or \nadministrators,\" or what claims are \"proper to be allowed by the committee.\" We \nare unable to say, therefore, from the context of the Code itself what the \nauthors thereof meant by the use of the phrases \"claims which survive against \nexecutors or administrators\" and which are \"proper to be allowed by the \ncommittee.\" All that is clear is that it was the intention of the law to \n<em>restrict the jurisdiction<\/em> of the committee and keep it within certain \nlimitations, and to that end used these limitative expressions. It should be \nnoted, however, that these limitations refer to claims and have no reference to \n<em>actions<\/em> begun against the deceased before his death. The distinction \nmade in the Code between claims and actions begun against the decedent during \nhis lifetime, and the respective provisions referring to those two subjects, is \nentirely lost sight of in the decision of the court. This being so, the \nfollowing reasoning found in the decision, based upon the failure to distinguish \nbetween claims and actions begun against deceased in his lifetime, involves a \nconclusion in no sense related to the premises from which it is deduced:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Do plaintiff's Claims fall within any of these sections? They are described \nin the will as debts. There is nothing in the will to indicate that any or all \nof them are contingent claims, claims for the possession of or title to real \nproperty damages for injury to person or property, real or personal, or for the \npossession of specified articles of personal property. Nor is it asserted by the \nplaintiff that they do. The conclusion is that they were claims proper to be \nconsidered by the committee.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That there is no necessary relation between these two subjects is apparent. \nThat an action for \"money, debt, or damages\" begun against the decedent in his \nlifetime must, under section 700, be discontinued upon his death \"and the claim \nembraced in such action may be presented to the committee, who shall allow the \nparty prevailing the costs of such action to the time of its discontinuance,\" \ndoes not necessarily mean that such claim, if no action had been begun upon it, \nis one which must be exhibited to the committee. Whether an action begun against \nthe decedent in his lifetime survives or does not survive, has no necessary \nrelation with the necessity of presenting a claim to the committee. Would it be \nlogical to argue that because an action begun against the deceased did not \nsurvive, the claim upon which it is based cannot, therefore, be presented to the \ncommittee, or that because an action begun against the deceased in his lifetime \ndid survive, that, therefore, the claim upon which it was based could and must \nbe presented to the committee? Assuredly not.<\/p>\n<p>No general requirement that all claims must be presented to the committee \nappearing in the Code, and it affirmatively appearing that there was an \nintention to restrict the power of the committee in the hearing of claims, it \nnecessarily follows that the conclusion reached by the court that <em>all<\/em> \nclaims must be exhibited to the committee is a pure inference and one not at all \nwarranted by the provisions of the Code or by the rules of interpretation and \nconstruction. To me it is a conclusion absolutely necessary from the language of \nsections 686 and 695 that not all claims need to be exhibited. By express \nlanguage these sections restrict the committee to the hearing of such claims as \nsurvive against executors and administrators and only those are barred which are \nproper to be presented to the committee.<\/p>\n<p>The answer to the question, does the claim at bar survive against executors \nor administrators, brings us to an exposition of the various fundamental errors \nmade by the court in holding that the debt in question is one which must be \npresented to the committee. One of them is involved in the declaration that the \ndebt in question is a claim within the meaning of the law. In cases such as this \nit is proper and necessary to make a distinction between a claim and a debt. A \ndebt is a claim which has been favorably passed upon by the highest authority to \nwhich it can in law be submitted and has been declared to be a debt. A claim, on \nthe other hand, is a debt in embryo. It is mere evidence of a debt and must pass \nthrough the process prescribed by law before it develops into what is properly \ncalled a debt. The debt in the case at bar never was a ,claim. By the act of the \ntestator himself, it was raised to the dignity of a debt and it remains such and \nmust be acted upon as such by the courts as well as by all others. It was by the \ntestator selected from the mass of his obligations, which are correctly called \nclaims, and treated to a process which developed it into a thing called a \"debt\" \nover which no committee has jurisdiction and with the due course of which it has \nno authority to interfere.<\/p>\n<p>The second fundamental error, following naturally from the first, is found in \nthe declaration of the court that the debt in question is a claim <em>which \nsurvives against the executor or administrator<\/em> and must, therefore, be \nexhibited to the committee. This error involves, in my humble opinion, a \nmisunderstanding of the nature of a will and of the obligation which a direction \nin a will imposes upon all persons executing it. A will is the testator speaking \nafter death. Its provisions have substantially the same force and effect in the \nprobate court as if the testator stood before the court in full life making the \ndeclarations by word of mouth as they appear in the will. That was the special \npurpose of the law in the creation of the instrument known as the last will and \ntestament. Men wished to speak after they were dead and the law, by the creation \nof that instrument, permitted them to do so. It is upon this theory and around \nthis purpose that there has grown that body of the law which uniformly and \nuniversally declares that the words of the testator spoken in his will shall be \nsacredly attended by his executor and enforced by the court. It has been \ndeclared a fundamental maxim, the first greatest rule, the sovereign guide, the \npole-star, in giving effect to a will, that the intention of the testator as \nexpressed in the will shall be fully and punctually observed. If by the use of \nclear and unambiguous language he has made his meaning clear and certain, his \nwill explains itself, and all that the court can do is to give it effect. All \ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the testator's having meant just what he \nsaid. His purpose may seem unjust, unnatural or absurd to us; yet, to refuse to \nexecute it is to destroy it. As Chief Justice Marshall said; \"The intent of the \ntestator is the cardinal rule in the construction of wills; and if that intent \ncan be clearly perceived, and is not contrary to some positive rule of law, it \nmust prevail.\" (3 Peters, 346.)<\/p>\n<p>The intention of the testator is said in a recent Virginia case to be \"the \nlife and soul of a will\" and if this intention is clear it must govern with \nabsolute sway. A will is not like a promissory note or a judgment or any other \ninstrument which acknowledges or incorporates an obligation. Those instruments \nare mere <em>evidences<\/em> of the debt. A will is not, primarily, \n<em>evidence<\/em> of anything; it is the thing itself. It is not so much the \n<em>evidence<\/em> of what the testator did or intended to do; it is the testator \nhimself. The court has failed in this case to distinguish between a will and a \npromissory note, or a mortgage, so far as their legal effects are concerned, and \nthe statement which I made early in this opinion, that the court has given no \nlegal significance whatever to the fact that the instrument in which this debt \nwas acknowledged and in which it was ordered paid was a last will and testament, \nis literally true. It has given the testamentary directions of the testator no \nmore force, effect or significance than it gives to the words of a promissory \nnote or a mortgage.<\/p>\n<p>The third fundamental error into which the decision has fallen is that it \nmisconceives the duties of an executor and of a court relative to the provisions \nof a will. It is, of course, axiomatic that it is the duty of the executor, \nunder the direction of the court, to carry out punctually and with the utmost \ncare every provision of the will. That is why he is named \"executor.\" He is an \n\"executor\" of a will because he \"executes\" the will. When he refuses or neglects \nto perform that function he ceases to be an executor and becomes a perverter or \na destroyer. Section 640 provides that the estate of a decedent shall be \ndisposed of according to his will and the bond to be given by an executor, \nprescribed in section 643, must contain a clause in which the executor agrees, \nand his bondsmen assure, that he will administer <em>\"according to the will of \nthe testator\"<\/em> the estate which comes into his hands.<\/p>\n<p>Under the provisions of this will it is as much the duty of the executor to \npay the debt here in litigation as it is to pay a legacy bequeathed by that will \nor to carry out a devise found therein. Of course, as we shall see later, if it \nappear to the executor that the debt in suit was paid, in whole or in part, by \nthe testator after he made his will, then, of course, he should refuse to pay \nthe debt, in whole or in part, as the case may be. In such case his refusal to \npay will not be a refusal to carry out the will, but will be grounded in the \nfact that the testator himself executed it prior to his demise. The proposition \nremains that the will must be executed; and the only excuse the executor can \ngive for a refusal to execute it is that it has already been executed.<\/p>\n<p>It is nowhere claimed in this case, and it cannot be, for no proceeding has \nreached far enough to involve the fact, that this debt has been paid, and \nnowhere in the record has its validity or binding force upon the estate been \nchallenged or even disputed. That being the case, upon the facts, as they stand \nbefore us, there is no excuse which the executor or the court can now offer why \nthe debt in suit has not been paid.<\/p>\n<p>The fourth fundamental error into which the court has fallen in its decision \nis that it submits to the jurisdiction of a committee to hear claims the \nquestion of whether or not the provisions of a will are to be executed. This, \nalthough, it seems to me, is strange upon its face, is precisely what the court \nhas, in effect, done in its decision; for, if a debt expressly acknowledged in \nthe will and specifically ordered paid therein, must be submitted to a \ncommittee, it means that they may, in the exercise of their judgment, refuse its \npayment. This, in its turn, means that the provision of the will in relation \nthereto is annulled. By this process the Committee may, therefore, annul an \nexpress and mandatory provision of a will which is as binding as a provision \ngiving a legacy or making a devise. It is to the probate court, and to it alone, \nthat the law confides the power to annul and set aside provisions in wills. The \nexecutor himself may not do so. And the court itself may do so only after the \nvery clearest demonstration that the provision violates a positive provision of \nlaw or is against the public policy of the state. In spite of this, it is the \ndecision of this court that a committee of two or more persons, none of whom is \na lawyer, none of whom may be even a business man, all of whom may be ignorant \nand inexperienced, may sit in an informal way, and with all the imperfections \ninherent in such a tribunal and the practice which governs its deliberations, \nmay revoke a mandatory provision in the most solemn instrument known to the law. \nThe bare statement of such a proposition is, it seems to me, its clearest \nrefutation.<\/p>\n<p>The fifth fundamental error into which the court has fallen follows \nnaturally. As we have said, the decision gives no significance to the fact that \nthe debt at bar appears acknowledged and legalized, in a last will and testament \nand that the testator therein solemnly ordered and directed his executor to pay \nit. Instead, the decision remands the creditor to the committee in exactly the \nsame condition as any other creditor. He goes there with the burden of proof on \nhim, with the necessity of establishing affirmatively and by a fair \npreponderance of the evidence the existence of the claim, the consideration \ntherefor, and the fact that it has not been paid. There are laid upon him the \nrestrictions and limitations imposed by section 383 of the Code of Civil \nProcedure, which stop his mouth as a witness under certain conditions. He is \nthere with every burden, with every restriction upon him under which another \ncreditor labors who has not a scrap of written evidence to support his claim. It \nis no adequate reply to say that he can put the will in evidence. He could do \nthat with any other evidence that he might have. Moreover, that reply is a full \nadmission of all that I have maintained, that the will is given no significance \nor value, <em>as such<\/em>, but is reduced to the mere function of being \n'evidence to be passed upon by the committee. Furthermore, it is incumbent upon \nhim to prove that the claim has not been paid and this is the very point which \nmay be the thing most difficult to establish; and it is in relation to this that \nthe restrictions and limitations imposed by the section referred to produce \ntheir greatest effect. This certainly cannot be law. It cannot be that a \ncreditor whose debt is recognized as is the one at bar occupies a position no \ndifferent from that of a creditor whose debt is not so recognized. To contend \nthe contrary, it seems to me, flies in the face not only of law and justice, but \nof common sense as well.<\/p>\n<p>The fact that a debt is mentioned in the will as one not satisfied has, at \nleast, the effect of changing the burden of proof from the creditor to the the \nestate. Instead of the creditor being required to establish the validity of the \nclaim and the fact of nonpayment; it is incumbent upon the estate to show \npayment affirmatively. At the very least, recognition by the testator in his \nwill should be given that much significance. The court does not even concede \nthis. The provision before us, while not a provision for a legacy, has \nnevertheless the same force and effect; and as a legatee is not bound to show \naffirmatively his right to the legacy and as it is the duty of the executor to \nseek out the legatee and pay him the legacy, so it is not the duty of the \ncreditor in this case to show affirmatively his right to the payment of the \ndebt, but it is the duty of the executor, knowing nothing to the contrary, to \nseek out the creditor and pay him as the testator has ordered him to do. If he \nknows anything to the contrary the burden is on him to demonstrate it.<\/p>\n<p>These considerations naturally lead us to the point so strongly urged in the \ndecision, and which I regard, for the purpose urged, without force, that the \ndebt may have been paid between the time of the making of the will and the death \nof the testator; and that, therefore, it ought not to be paid by the executor \nuntil the question of payment is properly determined. No one is disputing that \nproposition. But its admission does not at all mean that, to determine whether \nthe Claim has been paid or not, it must be presented to the committee. If it is \nthe duty of the court, through the executor, to see that the will is \nconscientiously executed, what more natural, if not absolutely necessary, than \nto submit to the court whether the provision recognizing a debt and ordering its \npayment should be carried out. What argument can be adduced, which does not fly \nsquarely in the face of reason, to establish the proposition that a court has no \nbusiness to determine whether a <em>particular<\/em> provision of a will shall be \ncarried out or not, <em>when its supreme duty is to require the punctual and \nprecise execution of the whole will? <\/em>How can it be maintained that, whether \nor not a <em>particular<\/em> provision in a will shall be carried out must be \nsubmitted not to the court, <em>which has exclusive jurisdiction of the whole \nwill,<\/em> but to a committee of two or more ignorant and in experienced \npersons? If it is the duty of the court to see that the will is executed <em>as \na whole,<\/em> then there must go with that duty the power to determine whether a \nparticular provision ordering the payment of a specific debt shall be executed \nor not. But the determination of this question is the determination of the \nquestion of payment. Why take from the court, which is the sole body that has \nthe power to determine whether provisions in wills shall be carried out, the \ndetermination of whether a debt recognized in a particular provision has or has \nnot been paid and turn it over to a committee such as I have described?<\/p>\n<p>It is thus seen that the proposition given so great weight in the decision, \nnamely, that the debt should be submitted to the committee in order to determine \nwhether it has been paid, is without point or force. The court could make that \ndetermination far better than a committee. The practice leading to the \ndetermination by a court as to whether or not a given provision in a will shall \nbe carried out is very simple, much simpler than is the proceeding before a \ncommittee. The executor finding that the will orders him to pay a certain debt \nand having no knowledge of his own that such debt has already been paid, \npresents his final account to the court, in which he asserts that he is going to \npay the debt in accordance with the provisions of the will. Notice is given to \nall parties interested in the estate. They appear. If they or any of them know \nof any reason why that provision of the will should not be carried out, they may \nmanifest it. Upon that manifestation a hearing will be had and the court will \ndetermine whether or not the provision of the will has already been executed, in \nwhole or in part, and upon that determination he will rest a judgment in which \nhe will order the executor to carry out the provision of the will by the payment \nof the debt or he will declare that the provision has already been carried out \nby payment. What simpler than this and what more conducive to justice? Who can \nsay that the submission of the same question to a committee is better than the \nsubmission to a court? It might as well be urged that the legalization of the \nwill itself were better left to a committee than to a court; for, if whether or \nnot the provisions of a will are to be carried out must be left to a committee, \nthen whether it is a will at all or not may as well be left to the same \nauthority. <\/p>\n<p>The attempt of the court to meet the proposition that the will of the \ntestator is the law of the case does not satisfy my judgment. It is claimed that \nthe will of the testator is not the law of the case where it is in direct \nviolation of a provision of law; and that the Code of Civil Procedure requiring \nthat <em>all<\/em> claims shall be presented to the committee, the testator has \nno right to except a particular debt or any debt from the operation of the \nCode.<\/p>\n<p>In the first place, the Code of Civil Procedure does not require that \n<em>all<\/em> claims shall be presented to the committee. It expressly limits the \nclaims which must be exhibited. t In the second place, the claim that there is \nanything contradictory between the will of the testator in this particular case \nand the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure is, in my judgment, rather \nfanciful than real. What is the purpose of requiring the exhibition of a claim \nto a committee? Simply to save the estate from being defrauded. There is \nabsolutely no other reason which is behind the law requiring such a \npresentation. Is it claimed that a debtor may not pay a claim during his \nlifetime? If not, and the will is but the testator speaking after death, may he \nnot pay a debt in that manner? If the man who is the estate solemnly \nacknowledges a debt and offers to pay it, who shall say that the estate is \ndefrauded if the debt be paid? And if the estate is not defrauded, neither the \nspirit nor the letter of the law which has for its object the protection of the \nestate has been violated or evaded, but has, on the contrary, been fully \nobserved.<\/p>\n<p>I do not discuss or express an opinion relative to the proposition that the \nstatute of nonclaims runs against a provision of a will, or suggest the results \nwhich may follow such a doctrine.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment should be reversed and the probate court ordered to hear \npetitioner's motion of the 21st of November and decide it upon the merits.<\/p>\n<p><br\/><\/p><\/div>",

The appellant admitted the killing, but pleaded \nself-defense.\n<p>The judgment of conviction was rendered on February 19, 1912, but on the 12th \nof March, 1912, the trial court set aside its former decision and entered a new \njudgment acquitting the defendant on the ground of \nself-defense.<br\/><br\/>Thereafter, upon the prayer of the Government, a writ of \ncertiorari was issued by this court, and the record having been brought here, we \nheld that the trial court had exceeded its jurisdiction in attempting to 8et \naside the judgment of conviction rendered on February 19, 1912, more than \nfifteen days after it had been lawfully entered. The result of our disposition \nof those proceedings was to leave the judgment of conviction rendered on \nFebruary 19, 1912, in full force and effect, and this appeal brings that \njudgment before us for review.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant and the deceased owned adjoining rice lands. At or about 6 \no'clock on the evening of the day mentioned in the information, both were \nworking on the their respective parcels of land, and a quarrel having arisen \nbetween them the defendant struck the deceased a blow on the right temple with a \npiece of bamboo about 7 feet long and as thick as a man's arm, inflicting a \nwound as a result of which the deceased died a few hours later without regaining \nconsciousness.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant admitted that he struck the fatal blow, but claimed that he did \nso in self-defense. He testified that the deceased was constructing a fence upon \nhis, the defendant's, land; that he asked the deceased why he built the fence \nupon his land; that the deceased came over into defendant's land, struck him and \nknocked him down in a pool of water which was about knee-deep; and that as he \nfell he seized a piece of bamboo which happened to be floating on the water, \nand, raising himself to a half-sitting posture, struck the fatal blow. In answer \nto the question: \"What did you think that the deceased wished to do to you?\" he \nreplied: \"He wished to kill me because he pushed me down into the water.\"<\/p>\n<p>The son of the deceased, 18 years of age, testified that he was working at a \npoint some 10 brazas distant, facing away from the defendant and his father. \nThat although he saw the fatal blow delivered he heard no altercation ad \nobserved no indication of a quarrel between his father and the defendant. At \nfirst he swore that this was all he saw, but later he added that he saw the \ndefendant approach his father and strike the blow without saying a word. That \nthereupon he went to the assistance of his father and asked the defendant why he \nhad struck him, to which defendant replied: \"I did not know what I was \ndoing.\"<\/p>\n<p>Robert Panet, who was also working -some little distance away, rushed to the \nscene of the occurrence upon hearing the cries of the son and when he came up to \nthe place where they were standing he said to them: \"What have you done, sons of \nman?\" to which the defendant replied that he did not know what he had done. From \nthe undisputed testimony of this witness and of the son, it would appear that \nthe deceased had his bolo in its sheath strapped upon his person underneath his \nshirt at the time when he came to his death.<\/p>\n<p>The president of the municipal board of health arrived on the scene a short \ntime thereafter and made an examination of the body of the deceased. His \ntestimony corroborates the testimony of the accused as to the fact that he \nstruck but one blow, upon the head of the deceased.<\/p>\n<p>This is all the material evidence in the record, and upon this evidence the \ntrial judge convicted the defendant of the crime of homicide. In attempting to \nset this judgment aside, he says that upon mature consideration he had concluded \nthat the testimony of the son of the deceased was not worthy of credence, and \nthat he had evidently testified falsely when he denied all knowledge of the \naltercation which resulted in the striking of the fatal blow. We agree with the \ntrial judge in this regard. The boy was standing at a distance of only 10 brazas \nfrom the defendant and his father, and yet he says he saw the fatal blow struck \nwithout hearing any words pass between them and without observing any indication \nof a quarrel. He would have us believe that without provocation and without any \nmotive whatever the accused deliberately walked toward his father and struck him \na deadly blow upon the head. We think the testimony of the accused as to the \nexistence of a quarrel is much more reasonable than that of this witness, and we \nare convinced that this witness deliberately refused to tell the whole truth as \nto what really occurred. On the other hand, the defendants testimony in support \nof his plea of self-defense is not wholly satisfactory. He claims that he struck \nthe fatal blow because the deceased was pushing him in the water and he feared \nthat he was going to drown him. In view of the fact that at the moment when he \nstruck the fatal blow he must have been some little distance from his opponent, \nit seems hardly possible that he could have believed that he was in any real \ndanger of his life from drowning in the shallow pool of water into which, as he \nclaims, the deceased attempted to thrust him.<\/p>\n<p>According to the story told by the accused, he was half sitting and half \nrising out of the water when he struck the fatal blow. The trial judge in his \ndecision points out that from the very nature of the wound the blow must have \nbeen delivered \"with terrible force,\" and the description of the wound upon the \nhead of the deceased by the president of the municipal board of health amply \nconfirms this understanding. The accused is a man 5 feet 2 inches high and \nweighs only 110 pounds, and it is, to say the least, difficult to understand how \nhe could have picked up a bamboo pole 7 feet long and as thick as man's arm, and \nthen strike the fatal blow from the half-sitting, half-rising position which he \ndescribed in the court below.<\/p>\n<p>We think that giving the accused the benefit of all reasonable doubts as to \nthe circumstances under which the blow was struck, we must find that the \naccused, having discovered that the deceased had built a part of his fence on \nthe land of the accused, asked the deceased why he had done so; that the \nquestion angered the deceased so that he rushed at the accused and pushed him \ninto a shallow pool of water, and then made some attempt to push him still \nfurther into the pool; that the deceased made no attempt to draw a bolo which he \nhad at his side; that the accused had no reason to believe that the deceased \nintended to take his life or do him any grave bodily harm; that the fatal blow \nwas struck by the accused in the heat of anger, in an attempt to defend himself \nfrom the unprovoked assault of the deceased, and that the fatal blow was struck \n\"with terrible force\" on the head of the deceased, and with a heavy bamboo pole \n7 feet long and as thick as a man's arm.<\/p>\n<p>Upon this finding of facts we are of opinion that while the defendant's plea \nof self-defense is not established, so as wholly to exempt him from criminal \nliability, it should be taken into consideration in accordance with the \nprovisions of article 86 of the Penal Code to reduce the degree of the penalty \nprescribed for the commission of the crime of homicide.<\/p>\n<p>Article 86 is as follows: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A penalty lower by one or two degrees than that prescribed by law shall be \nimposed if the deed were not wholly excusable by reason of the lack of some of \nthe conditions required for exemption from criminal liability in the several \ncases mentioned in article eight, provided that the majority thereof be present. \nThe courts shall impose the penalty in the degree which may be deemed proper, in \nview of the number and weight of the conditions of exemption present or \nlacking.<\/p>\n<p>\"This provision is understood to be without prejudice to that contained in \narticle eighty-four.\" <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Subsection 4 of article 8 is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The following are exempt from criminal liability:<br\/><br\/>* * * * * * \n*<br\/><br\/>\"4. Anyone who acts in defense of his person or rights, provided that \nthe following circumstances concur:<br\/><br\/>\"(1) Unlawful aggression;<br\/><br\/>\"(2) \nReasonable necessity for the means employed to prevent or repel it;<br\/><br\/>\"(3) \nLack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending \nhimself.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We are of opinion, giving the accused the benefit of all reasonable doubts, \nthat there was unlawful aggression on the part of the deceased, and lack of \nsufficient provocation on the part of the accused, but that there was no \nreasonable necessity for the use of the means employed by the accused to prevent \nor repel the aggression, or more accurately speaking, that the mode of defense \nadopted by him was in excess of what was reasonably necessary to protect himself \nfrom the aggression of his adversary.<\/p>\n<p>While the accused might have been and doubtless was justified in picking up \nthe bamboo pole to keep his adversary at bay, we do not think that under all the \ncircumstances he was justified in using it as he did. He was not in any real \ndanger of his life, and he must have known that he was not His adversary, \nalthough armed with a bolo, had not attempted to draw it, and limited his \nassault to an attempt to push the defendant back into the shallow pool into \nwhich he had been thrown at the outset of the quarrel. The accused must have \nbeen at some little distance from his victim when he struck the fatal blow with \na bamboo pole 7 feet long, and we are satisfied that to repel the assault of the \ndeceased, there was no reasonable necessity for his delivering a fatal blow at \nthe head of his adversary, with such a weapon, and with such \"terrible \nforce.\"<\/p>\n<p>We think that the judgment of the court below convicting the defendant of the \ncrime of homicide must be sustained, but we think that in imposing the penalty \nhe should be given the benefit of the provisions of article 86 of the Penal \nCode, and that having in mind the low order of intelligence of the accused \n(article 11 of the Penal Code as amended by Act No. 2142) the penalty should be \nreduced to six years and one day of <em>presidio mayor.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the court below, modified by substituting the penalty of six \nyears and one day of <em>presidio mayor<\/em> for so much thereof as imposes \ntwelve years and one day of <em>reclusion temporal,<\/em> should therefore be \naffirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.

No \nexception was taken to the ruling of the court upon the demurrer. Later the \ndefendant answered, setting up a general denial and a special defense. The \nspecial defense consisted\u2014<\/p>\n<p>First. Of a counterclaim in the sum of P18,500 as attorney's fees for \nservices rendered by the deceased, Domingo Franco, to the plaintiff; and, \nsecond, for the recovery of certain jewelry, of the value of P6,000, \nparticularly described in the answer of the defendant, alleged to be in the \npossession of the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>The first special defense, relating to attorney's fees, was later withdrawn \nby the defendant. The only questions left for litigation were:<\/p>\n<p>First. Whether the plaintiff was entitled to the recovery of the parcel of \nland in question; and, second, whether the defendant was entitled to recover \nfrom the plaintiff the jewelry described in her answer.<\/p>\n<p>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable Adolph Wislizenus, judge, in a \ncarefully prepared opinion, found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the \npossession of the land in question, together with the sum of P100 for each month \nfrom the month of June, 1911, until the possession of the land was returned to \nhim.<\/p>\n<p>The lower court further found that the defendant was entitled to the \npossession of said jewelry, and ordered the plaintiff to return the same to her \nand in case of the plaintiff's failure to return said jewelry to the defendant, \nthen and in that case, he shall pay to the defendant, for such failure, the sum \nof P6,000.<\/p>\n<p>From the judgment of the lower court, each of the parties, plaintiff and \ndefendant, appealed to this court. Later the defendant withdrew her appeal, \nthereby allowing that part of the judgment relating to the plaintiff's right to \nthe possession of the land in question, together with damages, to become final. \nThe only question remaining, therefore, for this court to decide is as to the \nownership and right of possession of said jewels. It is admitted that the jewels \nin question, before the possession of the same was given to the plaintiff, \nbelonged to the defendant personally and that she had inherited the same from \nher mother. The defendant, Lucia Martinez, is the widow of Domingo Franco, and \nafter the death of her husband she was appointed administratrix of his estate. \nThe record further shows (Exhibit C) that a short time before the death of \nDomingo Franco he borrowed from the plaintiff the sum of P4,500 and gave as \nsecurity for the payment of said sum the jewelry described in the complaint. The \nmoney was borrowed on the 7th day of April, 1911, under promise to repay the \nsame, with 12 per cent interest, on the 7th day of May, 1911. It is not clear \nwhether or not the jewelry, at the time of the execution of said document \n(Exhibit C), was in fact delivered to the plaintiff. Said exhibit states that \nthe jewelry was contained \"dentrb de una caja que queda cerrada despues de \ndemostradas las alhajas a D. Mariano Veloso\" (in a box which remains closed \nafter the jewels were shown to Mariano Veloso). The document further admits that \n\"la Have quedara en poder de D. Domingo Franco\" (the key shall remain in \npossession of Domingo Franco). After the death of Domingo Franco it appears that \nsaid jewelry was found in the same \"caja\" and that the key was in the possession \nof the defendant. It is very doubtful, indeed, under the facts, whether the \nplaintiff ever obtained the actual possession of the jewelry. His possession, \nhowever, seems to be admitted by the defendant in the present action. So far as \nthe record shows the jewelry was in the same box where it was found at the time \nof the execution and delivery of said Exhibit C and that the defendant still has \nthe key to said box.<\/p>\n<p>During the trial of the cause the plaintiff attempted to show that the jewels \nin question were pawned to him by Domingo Franco, with the full knowledge and \nconsent of the defendant. And not only that, the plaintiff further attempts to \nshow that after the death of Domingo Franco, the defendant promised to pay the \namount for which the said jewels were pawned. The defendant positively denies \nthat she knew that heiHiusband had pawned her jewels or that she promised to \nredeem the same by paying the amount due. No explanation is contained in the \nrecord why the jewels were placed in said box (presumably a money safe). In view \nof the fact, however, that the record shows that the jewels were the sole and \nseparate property of the wife, acquired from her mother, and in the absence of \nfurther proof, we must presume that they constituted a part of her paraphernal \nproperty. As such paraphernal property she exercised dominion over the same. \n(Article 1382, Civil Code.) She had the exclusive contrqkand management of the \nsame, until and unless she had delivered it to her husband, before a notary \npublic, with the intent that her husband might administer it properly. (Article \n1384, Civil Code.) There is no proof in the record that she had ever delivered \nthe same to her husband, in any manner, or for any purpose. That being true, she \ncould not be deprived of the same by any act of her husband, without her \nconsent, and without compliance with the provisions of the Civil Code above \ncited.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we find that the defendant is entitled to the \npossession of said jewels, or to their value, amounting to P6,000.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the lower court is therefore hereby affirmed, with costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

SANA LIM ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<\/title>This action has come before us on appeal raised by the defendants Sionga Yap, \nSana Lim, and Dina Lim, from the judgment of December 8, 1913, whereby the \nHonorable Adolph Wislizenus, judge, sentenced Tiburcio Ricablanca, King Kong \nKiang (alias Esteban), Sionga Yap, Sana Lim and Dina Lim each to the penalty of \nsix years ten months and one day of <em>prision mayor,<\/em> and to pay, each of \nthem, one-ninth of the costs. In the same judgment Rufino Cortes and Pedro \nBlando were acquitted, and by two orders of the same date, December 3, 1913, \nupon the petition of the provincial fiscal, the case was dismissed with respect \nto Eleno Suizo, in order to use him- as a witness, and also Manuel Balbuena, \nwith the costs <em>de officio.<\/em> (Record, pp. 24 and 25.) \n<p>The record in this case shows that it was duly proven that some days prior to \nSeptember 11, 1913, the Moro named Jamilassan disembarked from a <em>vinta<\/em> \nor small native boat, in which he and other Moros were traveling, upon the beach \nof the barrio of Simala, pueblo of Sibonga, Island of Cebu, carrying with him \n101 tins of opium, belonging to his employer, the Moro Tahil, for the purpose of \nselling the drug; that Jamilassan thereupon went to the store of the Chinaman \nKing Kong Kiang (<em>alias<\/em> Esteban), situated in the said barrio and near \nthe shore, to sell the opium, but that this Chinaman, instead of agreeing to buy \nit, went to the town of Sibonga and proposed its purchase to another Chinaman \nnamed Sionga, who in turn approached another Chinaman named Sana for the same \npurpose; that, as Sana did not have the money, Sionga then went to the municipal \ntreasurer of the pueblo, Tiburcio Ricablanca, to report the fact that the opium \nwas being offered for sale; that Rica-blanca thereupon conceived the idea of \nseizing the opium brought by the Moro Jamilassan, with the intent to obtain \nunlawful gain, and, with this purpose in view, arranged that one of the Chinaman \nshould pretend that he would buy the opium and upon his acquiring it the \ntreasurer and his accomplices would proceed to arrest the Moro, seize the opium \nfor the purpose of appropriating it to themselves, substitute molasses for a \npart of it and deliver to the authorities the molasses and a part of the opium \nso seized, together with the bearer of the drug. <\/p>\n<p>In order to carry out the plan thus conceived, the Chinamen Sionga and Dina \nwent to the pueblo of Carcar to buy molasses from the Chinaman Yap Chian, while \nthe treasurer Ricablanca gave orders to the police sergeant Eleno Suizo to take \ntwo subordinates, dressed as civilians and without uniforms, and accompany those \nwho were to execute the deed. On the night of the said 11th of September, 1913, \nthe Moro Jamilassan, who, with his companions and his employer Tahil, was in the \nsmall boat anchored off the shore of the said barrio, believing that the \nChinaman would buy the opium, went ashore carrying a sack that contained 101 \ntins of opium worth P3,333, or P33 a tin. Prior to his leaving the boat, the \ndefendants had posted themselves in the vicinity of the place where the Moro was \nto land. When Jamilassan, who was carrying the opium, drew near to Sionga, the \npretended purchaser, the latter, according to an arrangement previously made \nwith his companions, twice lit some matches, whereupon the defendants appeared \nupon the scene preceded by the sergeant and his policemen who, brandishing their \nweapons to frighten the Moro, arrested him and seized the opium he was carrying \nin the sack. At this moment, as the Moro succeeded in escaping toward the boat, \nthe sergeant fired his revolver four times and the treasurer Ricablanca also \nfired his. Thereupon the Moros in the boat precipitately fled from the shore, \nbut the one who carried the opium was finally captured.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants then appropriated to themselves 77 tins of the opium, set \naside 12 of them, and for the contents of the remaining 11 tins they substituted \nmolasses, 1 tin having been lost. These 12 tins of opium and 11 tins of molasses \nwere delivered by them to the authorities as having been legally seized in the \npossession of the Moro Jamilassan, the bearer of the drug.<\/p>\n<p>By reason of the foregoing facts, the provincial fiscal filed in the Court of \nFirst Instance a criminal complaint against the Chinese appellants, the \nmunicipal treasurer of the pueblo of Sibonga, some policemen and others who took \npart, charging them with having seized opium of the value of P3,300, the \nproperty of a Moro named Tahil, willfully, maliciously, and criminally, with \nintent to gain and by the use of violence and intimidation against the person of \nthe Moro Jamilassan, who was carrying the said drug.<\/p>\n<p>Article 502 of the Penal Code prescribes that the crime of robbery is \ncommitted by any person who, with intent to gain, shall take any personal \nproperty by the use of violence or intimidation against any person or force upon \nany thing.<\/p>\n<p>Although the subject matter of the robbery was an article whose introduction, \nuse, and keeping were, and are, strictly prohibited by the laws in force in \nthese Islands, wherefore all public officers vested with authority, and their \nagents, are under obligation to prosecute any violation of the law and to seize \nthe prohibited drug and all similar substances which are of course confiscated, \nunless their use or keeping has been expressely authorized by competent, \nauthority; yet, when it has been fully proved at the trial that the capture and \nseizure of the opium was effected by a public officer, assisted by agents of the \nauthorities, with the decided intent to gain thereby the price or value of the \nopium so seized, and not with the intention to comply with the law and further \nthe purposes of the Government in the eradication and suppression of the vice of \nits use, one which is very prevalent among the Chinese residents of these \nIslands and is also spreading among the native inhabitants; and when the \ncommission of the unlawful act was attended by violence and intimidation against \nthe person who was carrying the opium, it is improper to consider such \ntaking-and seizure as lawful and permissible, even though executed by agents \nauthorized to arrest and prosecute opium smugglers, inasmuch as the seizure of \nthe opium was effected with intent to gain and by the use of violence and \nintimidation, in the present case, against the person of the Moro who, as the \nagent of its owner, had possession of the drug.<br\/><br\/>The seizure of the opium \nand the arrest of its bearer by the agents of the authorities is indeed \npermissible and perfectly lawful; but that such agents, with the intent and \npurpose of appropriating to themselves the opium seized and of deriving benefit \nfrom its use or sale, should, with impunity and entire security, possess \nthemselves of the opium, cannot be tolerated. Until the agents of the \nauthorities have taken charge of it in the manner prescribed by the \nadministrative law, it is the property of the owner. The Moro Jamilassan having \nbeen deprived of the 101 tins of opium, which, by order of the owner of the \ndrug, he was carrying to sell, and this taking having been effected with \nviolence and intimidation on the part of the agents of the authorities, who \nacted in apparent compliance with the law, but really with intent to obtain \nunlawful gain, it is unquestionable that the crime of robbery, provided for and \npunished by articles 502 and 503, paragraph 5, of the Penal Code, was committed. \nThe legality and correctness of this classification of the crime are in no wise \naffected by the circumstance that the persons who committed it were agents of \nthe authorities, assisted by some private parties, since the public character \nwith which these agents were invested does not justify the criminal intent that \nprompted the execution of the punishable act, nor can it change the nature of \nthe crime they committed, inasmuch as, on the occasion of its perpetration, they \nacted, not as agents of the authorities in the fulfillment of the duties imposed \nupon them by the law, but as mere private parties, accompanied by some Chinamen, \nall of whom conspired together and concerted, under the direction of the \ntreasurer Ricablanca, for the purpose of seizing a considerable quantity of \nvaluable opium which was not their property, but belonged to the Moro Tahil, and \nwhich is an article that, upon seizure and confiscation within the territory of \nthis Archipelago, becomes the property of the Government, In this connection it \nis to be noted that the treasurer Ricablanca, before proceeding to seize the \nopium, gave no notice either to the municipal president or to the local chief of \nthe Constabulary, nor did he request the latter's assistance; all of which shows \nthat he did not act in good faith and according to the law.<\/p>\n<p>Without discussing the guilt of the defendant Ricablanca and the Chinaman \nKing Kong Kiang, neither of whom has appealed, we shall confine ourselves in \nthis decision to inquiring into that of the appellant Chinamen Sionga Yap, Sana \nLim, and Dina Lim. Their participation in the robbery under prosecution was very \ndifferent from that of the first two, inasmuch as Sionga Yap was present with \nthe policemen during the perpetration of the robbery, he took a direct part \ntherein and cooperated in its commission by the performance of acts without \nwhich, perhaps, his coparticipants would not have succeeded in seizing the \nopium. It was he who'pretended to purchase the drug by placing himself in direct \ncommunication with the Moro who carried it, and arranged the place and time when \nthe latter should appear on the beach at Simala with the opium for sale; it was \nthis same Chinaman who, in accordance with the agreement he had made with his \ncodefendants, went to the shore ahead of the latter there to await the Moro \nJamilassan who was expected with the opium; he, too, it was, who signaled the \narrival of the Moro on the shore, by lighting two matches, at which signal the \npolicemen and their companions came up and the former rushed upon the Moro, held \nhim fast, and by force possessed themselves of the opium, the securing of which \nwas the purpose of the common action of the plotters. It cannot be denied, \ntherefore, that Sionga participated as a coprincipal in the perpetration of the \nrobbery in question.<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the other two appellants, Sana Lim and Dina Lim, \nacted as accomplices in the commission of the crime. They cooperated by acts \nprior to and simultaneous with its perpetration, but the record does not show \nthat they performed acts that were necessary and indispensable for its \nrealization. With knowledge of the commission of the robbery and with the intent \nto obtain unlawful gain, they accompanied the principals in the crime up to a \ncertain distance from, though not near, the place where it was perpetrated, but \ndid not approach that place until after the robbery took place and then for the \nsole purpose of sharing in the booty or the division of the opium stolen. Hence, \nas these two defendants do not fall within any of the three classes specified in \narticle 13 of the Penal Code, which treats of principals, the said Sana Lim and \nDina Lim are to be considered as mere accomplices of the principals in the \nrobbery.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the defendants, arguing against the classification of the crime, \nalleges that at most it should be defined as estafa, and in support of his \ncontention cites several decisions of this court and of the supreme court of \nSpain, where the principle is laid down that such acts should be qualified as \nestafa and not robbery, for the reason that the agents of the authorities were \nauthorized to seize the opium and the persons having it in their possession or \nwho were its owners, and because the officers of the law could not, in the act \nof the .seizure of a prohibited article, have exercised violence and \nintimidation upon the person of a transgressor; that if after the seizure of the \nopium, they conceived the purpose of gain and it was then that they appropriated \nto themselves the opium seized, they would in such a case have committed the \ncrime of estafa, but not that of robbery.<\/p>\n<p>In answer to these allegations we must state that the robbery was engendered \nfrom the very moment when the principals resolved to possess themselves of the \nopium carried by the Moro Jamilassan, with the fixed and malicious intent to \nobtain unlawful gain from the said drug which, as was well and publicly known, \nobtained a high price among the Chinese, its chief consumers. With that end in \nview, they came to an agreement, formed a conspiracy among themselves and, under \nthe direction of the treasurer Ricablanca, decided upon the method by which they \nshould possess themselves of the opium so that they might derive profit from its \nsale. They later took the opium from the possession of its bearer by means of \nviolence and intimidation, since four shots were fired by one of the policemen \nand another by the treasurer Ricablanca, who was present at the commission of \nthe robbery. There is, therefore, no question that the persons who, with \nmalicious intent to obtain' unlawful gain and by the use of violence and \nintimidation, forcibly possessed themselves of the opium carried by the Moro \nJamilassan, proceeded and acted in the same manner as robbers usually do who, \nwith intent to gain, take possession of another's property against the will of \nits owner.<\/p>\n<p>In the cases cited by the defense to show that the crime under prosecution \nshould be classified as estafa and not as robbery, the guilty persons first \nacted in good faith in the discharge of their duties and without any unlawful \nintention, and the intent to derive illicit gain was formed only after they had \nlegally seized the property. For this reason those acts cannot be classified as \nrobbery, only as estafa, because prior to and at the time of their performance, \nthey acted as agents of the authorities and in accordance with law, and only \nafter they were in possession of the property, did they conceive the idea of \nderiving profit therefrom by appropriating it to themselves for personal gain. \n<\/p>\n<p>In the case at bar, both the treasurer Ricablanca and the Chinese appellants, \nfrom the moment they proposed to seize the opium which the Moro Jamilassan \ncarried for sale, had the intention to appropriate to themselves the greater \npart of the drug. They even planned to deceive the authorities by substituting \nmolasses for the contents of 11 of the 23 tins of opium which they presented to \nthe said authorities as legally seized from Jamilassan. They kept 77 of the tins \nso seized and made no report of them to their superior, nor does the record show \nthat these tins were afterwards recovered from the possession of the defendants. \nTherefore it is just and proper that the crime in question should be classified \nas robbery, and not as estafa.<\/p>\n<p>In the commission of the crime account must be taken of the attendance of the \naggravating circumstance No. 15, to wit, that the crime was committed in the \nnighttime and in an uninhabited place, without any extenuating circumstance to \noffset its effects. No weight can be given to abuse of superior strength, that \ncircumstance being inherent in the crime of robbery, even though it were not \ncommitted by a band of armed men.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment \nappealed from are deemed to have been refuted, the said judgment is affirmed in \nso far as it agrees with this decision and reversed in so far as it does not, \nand we hereby sentence the Chinaman Sionga Yap, as a principal, to the penalty \nof six years ten months and one day of <em>presidio mayor<\/em> and to the \naccessory penalties of article 57, and each of the other Chinamen, Sana Lim and \nDina Lim, as accomplices, to six months of <em>arresto mayor<\/em> and the \naccessory penalties of article 61. Furthermore, Sionga is sentenced to restore, \njointly and severally with his coprincipals, the opium stolen or to pay the \nvalue thereof to the Government of the Philippine Islands, and the accomplices, \nSana Lim and Dina Lim, are held to be bound, also jointly and severally between \nthemselves and subsidiarily in default of fulfillment, for the civil liabilities \nincurred by the principals, and each of the three appellants shall pay one-third \nof the costs of this instance. The opium seized and all quantities thereof that \nmay be recovered shall be confiscated.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The persons arrested were conveyed in the regular way before the \nproper officials and were subsequently tried and convicted and are here now on \nappeal. Before arriving at the municipal building with the prisoners the \nappellants, with others, abstracted the contents of 11 of the cans and put in \nplace thereof some other substance not opium, the opium thus abstracted being \nconverted by the appellants to their own use and benefit and to the use and \nbenefit of others. It is admitted that the seizure of the remaining 90 cans was \nlegal, proper and commendable.<\/p>\n<p>This is all there is of this case. <\/p>\n<p>It is contended by the court that the crime of robbery was committed because \nthe opium was taken by force and violence.<\/p>\n<p>In my judgment the case, as put by the court, cannot be stated without \ninvolving irreconcilable contradictions. It is unquestioned, of course, that it \nwas the duty of the appellants as peace officers of the municipality of Sibonga \nto arrest all people found in the illegal possession of opium and to seize the \nopium found. No one disputes this. It is done every day in all parts of the \nIslands. If the appellants had not arrested the possessors of the opium and \nseized the opium itself as they did, they would have been recalcitrant in their \nduty and would have made themselves liable to disciplinary punishment, if not \nremoval from office.<\/p>\n<p>How, then, is it possible to contend that their arrest of the persons found \nin possession of the opium and the seizure of that opium was illegal and \nconstituted robbery by the use of force and violence against the persons who \npossessed the opium?<\/p>\n<p>It is, of course, unquestionable that one of the essential elements of \nrobbery is force and violence either upon the person or upon the thing. If the \nacts which constituted the force and violence are not only legal acts but acts \nwhich the parties who executed them <em>are in duty bound to perform<\/em> and \nsuch performance<em> is in the interests of the public,<\/em> how can they \nconstitute robbery by force and violence? The mere statement of the proposition \ndiscussed in the case is a refutation of the conclusion. It is a perfect \ncontradiction of terms to assert that an officer of the law who legally arrests \na person guilty of a crime and seizes the property which constitutes the \ngravamen of the offense is guilty of an illegal use of force and violence upon \nthe person arrested and the property seized.<\/p>\n<p>The proposition which I assert is clearly and explicitly sustained in the \ncase of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Atienza (2 Phil. Rep., 242). In that case a \nlieutenant ordered a soldier to seize all the money in the possession of a \ncertain person, it being believed that such money was the property of a \nrevolutionary officer. He did so, but before delivering the money to his \nsuperior officer appropriated a portion of it to his own use and benefit. He was \ncharged with robbery, as in the case at bar, for having taken the property with \nforce and violence.<\/p>\n<p>The court, discussing that proposition, said: \"Nevertheless, this act does \nnot constitute the crime of robbery, with which the accused is charged in the \ncomplaint. The seizure of the money in Father Ilagan's house and that of his \nfamily was not in itself unlawful, because it was done in obedience to a lawful \norder given for that purpose by competent authority. The unlawful and punishable \nappropriation took place subsequently to this act, when the money appropriated \nwas lawfully in the possession of the accused. The order given to him by his \ncommanding officer was for the precise purpose of the seizure of this money, and \nconsequently the seizure in itself does not constitute an act of unlawful \ntaking, a necessary element for the existence of the crime of robbery, as well \nunder the different cases covered by article 502 and the other articles included \nin the chapter of the Penal Code, which deals specifically with robberies, as in \nthe special case covered by article 206 of the said code.\"<\/p>\n<p>This case is conclusive of the case before us. The seizure of the opium in \nthe case at bar \"was not in itself unlawful, because it was done in obedience to \na lawful order given for that purpose by competent authority.\" In the case at \nbar it was the duty of the appellants, and they had received orders, to arrest \nall persons found in the illegal possession of opium and to seize the opium. In \nthe case cited \"the order given to him by his commanding officer was for the \nprecise purpose of the seizure of this money;\" in the case at bar the order \ngiven to the appellants was for the precise purpose of the seizure of the \nopium.<\/p>\n<p>In my judgment, there is confusion in the decision as to the nature of the \ncrime committed. The unlawful act took place after the arrest and seizure. It is \nclear that the officers, in converting to their own use a part of the opium \n<em>after it had been legally seized,<\/em> committed a crime; but they took \nadvantage of their official position to get the opium into their possession in a \nlawful manner. Their whole purpose was to avoid the necessity of robbing the \npossessors of the opium by forcibly seizing it. They preferred, and <em>it was \ntheir precise purpose,<\/em> to obtain possession of the opium <em>in a legal \nmanner,<\/em> and they took advantage of their official position to that end. \nAfterward they again took advantage of that lawful possession to profit \nillegally. It was, I repeat, their object to obtain <em>legal<\/em> possession \nand they did obtain it by making a bona fide arrest and a bona fide seizure and \npresenting the prisoners and most of the property seized to the proper public \nofficials for further action in the premises.<\/p>\n<p>It is clear that the crime committed is misunderstood by the court. It \nprobably constitutes the crime of estafa or possibly, of malversation of public \nproperty, the opium being subject to confiscation on the conviction of its \npossessors for a violation of the Opium Law. The fact that the persons \ncommitting the estafa were public officials would be an aggravating circumstance \nunder paragraph 11, article 10, of the Penal Code, which provides that it shall \nbe an aggravating circumstance if, in the commission of the crime, \"advantage be \ntaken by the offender of his public position.\"<\/p>\n<p>If the crime were malversation of public property, then, of course, this \naggravating circumstance would not apply, as it would be one of the \ncircumstances qualifying the crime and not aggravating it.<\/p>\n<p>That the crime committed is misunderstood by the court is clearly \ndemonstrated by a further statement of the court in the case of United States \n<em>vs.<\/em> Atienza, above, which is as follows: \"The subsequent conversion by \nthe accused, after getting the money into his possession, by keeping part of it \ninstead of turning it all over to the officer who directed the seizure, may \nperhaps constitute the crime of malversation of public funds or that of estafa, \naccording to whether the accused may or may not be regarded as having been in \nthe discharge of the duties of a public officer when committing the deed, and \nthat the money converted came into his possession by reason of his office.\"<\/p>\n<p>This case clearly settles the whole question before us. It is logical and \nunequivocal. All the court agreed to the decision except Justice Torres, who \ndissented and who now presents, as the writer of the prevailing opinion, the \nsame arguments which were presented by him in his dissent in the case of United \nStates vs. Atienza and were there rejected. These arguments are now \naccepted.<\/p>\n<p>It is urged as the basis of a distinction between the case at bar and the \ncase of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Atienza that, in the case at bar, the \nintention was formed to convert the opium prior to the arrest, and that that \nintention made the arrest forcible, illegal, and criminal. The mere statement of \nthis proposition is its own refutation. To assert that an act which is not only \nlawful but <em>required by law<\/em> is made illegal by reason of the intention \nof the official who performs it, is to state an absurdity. Moreover, with their \nintention to convert the opium to their own use ran also the purpose of getting \npossession of that opium <em>legally,<\/em> and they did it by exercising the \nduties of their office in a manner which the law not only approved but \ncompelled.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, which of the 101 cans of opium did the officers, before the arrest, \nintend to convert to their own use? It is admitted that the 101 cans of opium, \nat the time they were seized, were all in one package, and that all of the cans \nwere seized <em>at the same time and by the same act.<\/em> Prior to the arrest \nand seizure, therefore, the appellants had not decided upon any particular cans \nof opium, such as the 11 cans, and separated those out for the purpose of \nconverting them after the arrest and seizure. If there was any intention at all \nto misappropriate any of the opium, it was an intention to misappropriate an \nundivided portion thereof, which portion was entirely unknown, so far as the \nspecific cans are concerned, at and before the seizure thereof. It is impossible \nto say, therefore, as to which of the cans the evil intention of the appellants \nreferred.<\/p>\n<p>The absurdity of holding that the seizure of the 11 cans of opium was robbery \nmay be still further demonstrated. As we have already said, it is admitted that \nthe 101 cans of opium constituted and formed one package at the time of the \nseizure and that the seizure of the whole 101 cans was made at the same time and \nby the same act. Now, the seizure of the 11 cans, says the court, was a forcible \nand violent seizure and was so illegal and criminal as to constitute the crime \nof robbery. But what about the seizure of the remaining 90 cans? Was not the \nseizure of the 90 cans exactly like that of the 11, since all the cans were in \none package and were all seized at the same time and by the same act? But the \nseizure of the 90 cans was admittedly proper, legal, and commendable. That being \nso, how can the seizure of the 11 cans be robbery? How can the seizure of a \npackage, consisting of 101 cans of opium, be robbery as to a part of the package \nand perfectly legal and proper as to the balance? How is it possible, under the \ncircumstances of this case, that the seizure of the 90 cans be legal and the \nseizure of the 11 cans be robbery? It is not possible, of course. The 11 cans \nand the 90 cans were intermingled in one package and constituted together the \n101 cans seized on the arrest. The seizure of 1 can was exactly like the seizure \nof every other and had precisely the same effect and produced precisely the same \nresult. Yet the court holds that as to the 11 cans the act was robbery and as to \nthe 90 cans it was legally proper.<br\/><br\/><\/p><\/div>",

The \ndefendant Rafael Villanueva, in his answer, recognized the rights of the \nplaintiff to the land in question.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant Aniceto G. Medel answered, stating that he was ignorant of the \nrespective rights of the plaintiff and of the defendants, Villanueva and Samson, \nand prayed the court to make an investigation, for the purpose of ascertaining \nwho was the real owner of the land, as between the said parties.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant Felix Samson, in his answer, alleged that he was the owner of \ncertain parcels of land located in the same sitio as the land which the \nplaintiff was attempting to recover and prayed that he be relieved from any \nresponsibility under the complaint.<\/p>\n<p>Upon the issue thus formed, the cause was brought to trial on the 21st of \nFebruary, 1912. It appearing from the allegations of the petition and answer \nthat the only question presented to the court was one relating to the identity \nof the lands in question, the parties agreed to the appointment of a \ncommissioner for the following purposes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"1. To prepare a map or plan of the land showing each of the parcels as well \nas their metes and bounds and their respective areas.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. To examine witnesses and take in writing their testimony as to the \nseveral parcels of land and as to whom they belonged at the public sale that was \nhad.<\/p>\n<p>\"3. To determine whether or not the land which Felix Samson states in his \nanswer was bought by him is the same land described in the complaint of \nplaintiff Luis Rivaya; and<\/p>\n<p>\"4. To set forth in his report all those facts the insertion whereof the \nparties may request in writing.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It was further agreed that the court should appoint Mr. Jose Sarte of the \npueblo of Ligao, Province of Albay, as said commissioner, for the purpose of \nmaking an investigation and to report as soon as possible upon the questions \nsubmitted to him.<\/p>\n<p>It was further agreed that the court should render a final judgment upon the \nreport of the said commissioner.<\/p>\n<p>On the 19th day of August, 1912, the said commissioner made his report. To \nthat report, the defendant, Felix son, objected and moved that the court order \nthe said commissioner to make a further investigation and another report. The \ncourt granted the objection and the motion of the defendant Samson.<\/p>\n<p>On the 28th day of September, 1912, the said commissioner made his second \nreport. To the second report the defendant Samson also objected. The lower \ncourt, after hearing the arguments of the defendant Samson to the second report, \noverruled said objection and rendered a decision upon the facts stated in said \nsecond report of said commissioner.<\/p>\n<p>The lower court found, from the facts stated in said second report, that the \nplaintiff was the owner and entitled to the possession of the three parcels of \nland described in his complaint and ordered the defendant Samson to return to \nthe plaintiff said parcels of land and to pay the costs. From that decision the \ndefendant Samson appealed to this court and made several assignments of \nerror.<\/p>\n<p>The appellant devotes much space in his brief in attempting to show that the \nlower court committed an error in basing his judgment upon the report of the \ncommissioner. It is true that the commissioner was not appointed in accordance \nwith the provisions of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions. (Sees. 135, 136.) \nNevertheless, the record shows that he was appointed by agreement of the \nparties. The record also shows that the parties agreed that the judge should \nbase his decision upon the facts stated in the report of said commissioner. \nWhile the appellant attempts to show that the commissioner did not consider all \nof the proof which he presented, yet he does not attempt to show that, even if \nthe proof had been considered by the commissioner and had been presented to the \ncourt, that it would in any manner have changed the result. The mere fact that \nthe commissioner considered unimportant some of the proof which the appellant \npresented, which the appellant thought was important, is not sufficient to \njustify a reversal of the judgment, unless and until it is shown that such proof \nwas in fact important and sufficient to overcome the evidence admitted. The \nappellant makes no effort to show, admitting that all of the proof had not been \ntaken into consideration by the commissioner, that it was sufficient to counter \nbalance the proof which the commissioner did consider.<\/p>\n<p>Some argument was adduced during the consideration of the cause to the effect \nthat, inasmuch as the commissioner had not been appointed in accordance with the \nprovisions of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions, all of his acts were null \nand that the cause should be reversed on that account. It is a well-known fact \nthat in many of the provinces of the Philippine Islands the courts are called \nupon to consider questions relating to the title of lands which are situated a \ngreat distance from the capital of the province where the coort is held, The \nmethod adopted in the present case is one of great convenience to the court, as \nwell as to the parties litigant. To require witnesses to travel a great distance \nfor the purpose of giving their testimony in court, when, by the appointment of \na commissioner, their testimony may be taken in the community where they reside, \nwould be a matter of great inconvenience to them, and not only to them but to \nthe parties litigant. For the reason that the parties agreed that the testimony \nshould be taken before a commissioner and that the court should base his \nconclusions upon the report of said commissioner, we find no good reason for \nreversing or modifying the decision of the court, simply because one or the \nother of the parties is not satisfied with the report of the commissioner.<\/p>\n<p>We find nothing in the record which justifies a modification or reversal of \nthe judgment of the lower court. The same is therefore hereby affirmed, with \ncosts.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The case is before this court for a new trial upon \nappeal from that judgment.<\/p>\n<p>\"During the trial Sergeant Worrel and Patrolman Pe\u00f1alosa testified as \nwitnesses. From their testimony it appears that in a house known as No. 363 \nCalle Ilang-ilang, in one of the living rooms thereof, there were found upon a \nbed certain utensils used in the smoking of opium, namely, a pipe, a lamp and \nthree small packages, two of them empty and one containing a quantity of opium. \nThey also testified that when they entered the room there was a strong odor of \nopium fumes and that the opium pipe found upon the bed was still warm.<\/p>\n<p>\"With respect to the evidence of the accused, their testimony establishes the \nentry of the house by the police and the arrest, but they avoided answering \nquestions relative to the utensils that were found in the room, as to who was \nthe person who was smoking opium there that night, as well as the designation of \nwhat person was occupying the room and bed on that night.<\/p>\n<p>\"There is no proof whatever, on the other hand, that the house, which was a \nChinese club, was a place destined or habitually used for the smoking of opium, \nfor if it had been other utensils for the smoking of the drug would have been \nfound; and there not having been found more than those shown to the court, it \nmay not be asserted that said house was destined or habitually used as a place \nfor the smoking of opium.<\/p>\n<p>\"The defense in discussing the presence of the accused in the house \nmaintained that they were not there as visitors but that they lived there. Four \nof the accused, Chua Eng Cheng, Chen Po, Uy Ching, and Ngo Tiao, were employees \nof the club, the first being the clerk, the second the cashier, the third the \ncollector, and the fourth the cook. The other, Sec Hong, was a transient who had \narrived from Tacloban three weeks before and was a guest at the club.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is not necessary to discuss the relations which the accused bore to the \nclub on that night. The fact is sufficient that all of them were caught on that \noccasion in said house and that in said house opium was being smoked at that \ntime. This is sufficient to establish a violation of Ordinance No. 152, article \n3, if it is clear to the court that opium was being smoked there in that house \nat that time and that the accused were there present.<\/p>\n<p>\"Wherefore the court declares the said accused guilty of a violation of \nOrdinance No. 152, article 3, and affirms the judgment of the municipal court \nsentencing each one of them to pay a fine of P100 and to suffer the \ncorresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of nonpayment as provided by \nlaw.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The petitioners contend that, the Supreme Court having already held in the \ncase of United States<em> vs.<\/em> Ten Yu (24 Phil. Rep., 1), that, before a \nconviction can be had under section 3 of Ordinance No. 152, \"the defendants may \nprove, if the fact exists, that they visited the place described in the \ncomplaint lawfully and not in violation of the provisions or the spirit of said \nordinance,\" and that, in effect, it must be shown, to sustain a conviction under \nsaid ordinance that the house visited was one generally used for the smoking of \nopium, and it appearing by an affirmative statement in the decision of the Court \nof First Instance that the house in question was a Chinese club and was not \ndestined or generally used for the smoking of opium, and there being no finding \nthat the accused were unlawfully there, the judgment of conviction has nothing \nto sustain it and is, therefore, absolutely void. That such being the case, a \nwrit of habeas corpus will lie, it is contended, as imprisonment under a \njudgment absolutely void is an illegal imprisonment. In support of their \ncontention petitioners cite numerous authorities folding in substance that, \nwhile a court may have authority to hear and determine a cause, its \ndetermination or judgment must be within the law and such power does not \nauthorize it, simply because it has jurisdiction to render some judgment in the \ncause, to trample down the prisoners' fundamental and constitutional rights by \npronouncing a sentence unauthorized by law. Or, to put the contention in another \naspect, in addition to jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter, the \ncourt must have jurisdiction to render <em>the particular judgment.<\/em> \nAuthorities are cited to the further proposition that habeas corpus will lie for \nthe discharge of one imprisoned for an act which does not constitute any offense \nknown to the law.<\/p>\n<p>While the authorities cited sustain the propositions advanced, neither the \none nor the other applies, in our judgment, to the case before us. It is \nadmitted that the court had jurisdiction over the person of the petitioners and \nthat it had jurisdiction to try a person accused of violating section 3 of \nOrdinance No. 152. There was, therefore, jurisdiction over the person and the \nsubject matter. It is equally undoubted that, if the acts of the petitioners \nconstituted the crime defined in that ordinance, they were properly convicted. \nIt having been demonstrated by the evidence, as stated in the decision of the \ntrial court, that the petitioners were found in the club house in question and \nthat opium was being smoked therein, it became the duty of the court to \ndetermine, by the exercise of its judicial functions, whether such acts \nconstituted the crime defined by the ordinance. This was a judicial \ndetermination admittedly within the jurisdiction and authority of the court to \nmake. That being so, the exercise of that jurisdiction would not result in a \nvoid judgment, provided the court kept within the limits thereof. In the \ndetermination of the case before it, it is clear that the court kept fully \nwithin the limits of its jurisdiction and, exercising the authority which it had \na right to exercise within that jurisdiction, determined the question whether \nthe acts developed by the evidence fell within the prohibition of the ordinance. \nThis same question is one which is passed upon by a court every time it tries a \ncriminal cause. That is one of the necessary adjudications. If it is to be held \nthat a wrong determination of that question deprives the court of jurisdiction, \nthen the correctness of a judgment of conviction in a criminal case will nearly \nalways be determinate by a writ of habeas corpus. (<em>Ex parte<\/em> Coy, 127 U. \nS., 731.) This, of course, is not the function of that writ, and makers of \nlegislation and constitutions which preserve the writ never intended that it \nshould be used in that manner and for that purpose.<\/p>\n<p>The petitioners also cite authorities, among them cases of this court, which \ndeclare that a finding with nothing to sustain it is arbitrary and useless and \nis a nullity. (Edwards <em>vs.<\/em> McCoy, 22 Phil. Rep., 598.) We may admit, \nfor purposes of discussion, that the authorities cited lay down the proposition \nas stated and still they fail to support the contention to which they are cited. \nIt is to be noted that these decisions say that a finding with <em>nothing<\/em> \nto support it is a nullity. It should also be noted that in the cases in which \nthose decisions are found there is absolutely nothing upon which the mind of the \ncourt making the finding could act to arrive at the conclusion reached. In other \nwords, there was an entire absence of any fact whatever which by any possibility \ncould support the finding or which could even tend to support it. The finding \nwas utterly without relation to any fact of record, was drawn from nothing \nexcept imagination, was a pure invention, was not the result of the operation of \nthe mind of the board upon a fact or circumstance, was not the product of the \nexercise of the deliberative faculty, but was a creation from nothing, a \nfiction, an arbitrary thing. That is not the case before us. Here we have \nevidence which supports the finding, although not sufficiently. There is \nevidence showing that opium was smoked in a house and that the accused were \npresent at the time the smoking was going on. To support properly the judgment \nof conviction it would be necessary to have only two additional facts, namely, \nthat the house was destined and generally used for the smoking of opium and that \nthe accused were there unlawfully. Those two facts, added to the other facts \nalready established, would have sustained a conviction.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, in considering these cases it must be remembered that they relate \nto the findings of boards of special inquiry and not to the decisions of \ncourts.<\/p>\n<p>It is clear, therefore, that the case in hand is not one where there is an \nabsolute failure of anything to support the conviction, where the finding is a \npure invention, a creature of the imagination only, an arbitrary thing. It is, \nrather, a case in which there is <em>some<\/em> evidence to support the \nconviction,<em> but not enough.<\/em> The difference between a finding with \nabsolutely nothing to support it and a finding with something, although not \nsufficient, to support it, is very great. In fact, this difference is the \ndetermining feature of the case before us.<\/p>\n<p>While the judgment attacked in these proceedings was erroneous and the \nconviction unwarranted by the evidence as it stands before us, it was not void. \nThe record presents simply a case where the conviction is not sustained by the \nevidence. While it may be a case of improper conviction, the court had \njurisdiction to convict and its determination, therefore, is not a nullity. It \nnecessarily follows that the petitioners are restrained of their liberty by \nreason of being \"in custody of an officer under process issued * * * by virtue \nof a judgment * * * of a court of record, and that the court * * * had \njurisdiction to issue the process, render the judgment or make the order, * * * \n.\" (Code Civ. Proc, sec. 528.)<\/p>\n<p>The applications for the writs are denied. Costs <em>de officio.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Since writing the above decision an application has been made to amend the \npetition in this proceeding by inserting an allegation to the effect that the \naction in which the petitioners were convicted was entitled, both in the \nmunicipal court and in the Court of First Instance, \"City of Manila <em>vs.<\/em> \nNgo Yao Tit, Chen Po, Uy Ching, Sec Hong, and Ngo Tiao\" and \"City of Manila \n<em>vs.<\/em> Chua Eng Cheng.\"<\/p>\n<p>It is urged that, in view of the decision of this court in the case of the \nCity of Manila <em>vs.<\/em> Rizal (p. 50, <em>ante<\/em>), the action should have \nbeen in the name of the United States and not the city of Manila; and that, the \naction having been wrongly entitled, the court acquired no jurisdiction of the \nperson or the subject matter of the action and that its judgment of conviction \nwas absolutely void. This being the case, it is argued, habeas corpus will lie \nas the imprisonment is illegal.<\/p>\n<p>We cannot agree with this contention. The bringing of the action in the name \nof the city of Manila instead of the United States is an error merely and not a \njurisdictional defect. It is not similar to the case where, as claimed by \npetitioners, an information is filed by a person who is not authorized in law to \nfile it. The fact that the city of Manila was the plaintiff in the action does \nnot signify that said city was the person who signed and filed the information. \nThe accused were prosecuted by the same officials, before the same court, and in \nthe same manner as they would have been if the action had been brought in the \nname of the United States, and they received the benefits of the same rights and \nthe same privileges which they would have received if the action had been \nproperly entitled. They have been in no sense injured or prejudiced.<\/p>\n<p>The defect is one which could have been cured at any stage of the trial by an \namendment on the motion of the court itself or upon the motion of any person \ninterested in the prosecution. Defects of that character which are not taken \nadvantage of in the court below in the manner prescribed by law cannot be raised \nfor the first time here, and especially in a petition for a writ of habeas \ncorpus.<\/p>\n<p>The writ of habeas corpus was not intended and cannot be used to correct mere \nerrors or defects in proceedings, and accordingly does not lie in the present \napplication.<\/p>\n<p>The writ is denied.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J.,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, J.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><em>Carson<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur in the result.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

Crossfield, \njudge, found in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants by ordering \nthe latter to restore to the former possession of the land, the boundaries of \nwhich were therein given, situated on Calle Benavides, Nos. 723 and 725, and \ncontaining an area , in accordance with the plan, Exhibit B, of 599 square \nmeters and 61 square centimeters, and likewise the possession of the buildings \nand other improvements made thereon, and to pay him the value of the rental of \nthe said property, at the rate of P3 per month, since the date of Andres de \nGuzman's death; without special finding as to costs.\n<p>Counsel for the plaintiff, in a written complaint filed in the Court of First \nInstance of this city on September 6,1912, prayed that judgment be rendered \ndecreeing the ownership, possession and title of the following described urban \nproperty to be in the plaintiff, by himself and in his capacity of judicial \nadministrator of the estate of the deceased Juliana Uy Chico, to wit, a parcel \nof land situated on Calle Benavides of the district of San Jose, Trozo, and \nbounded on the right of its entrance by the house No. 31 of Isabel Pantic; on \nthe left, by the lot of Flaviano Abreu; and on the rear, by a lot without \nnumber, belonging to the plaintiff himself; which land, in the form of a \nquadrilateral, has an area of 613 square meters and appears in the provisional \nregister of the municipality, Binondo section, as property No. 571, first \ninscription. Said counsel further prayed that the defendants be sentenced to \nrestore the possession of the said property to the plaintiff and to pay him \nP4,325, amount of the rentals therefor owed and unpaid and to pay him such other \nrentals as might become due. He also alleged that the plaintiff and the estate \nof the said Uy Chico were the owners of the property in question and that they \nwere entitled to possession and title thereof, to the exclusion of all others; \nthat Andres de Guzman and the defendants occupied it under lease in or about the \nmonth of March, 1895, and had paid the plaintiff rental therefor from the said \nyear to January, 1899, though subsequently thereto and up to the date of the \ncomplaint they had refused to pay him the said rental, wherefore they owed him \nthe sum mentioned, which, not-withstanding the judicial and extrajudicial \ndemands made upon them, he had not succeeded in collecting; and that the \ndefendants still continued unlawfully to occupy the said property under the \nclaim of ownership and possession, to the damage and prejudice of the \nplaintiff's rights and interests.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the defendants in his written answer admitted the facts contained \nin paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the complaint and made a general and specific \ndenial of those contained in the remaining paragraphs thereof; and, in special \ndefense, denied that the defendants had leased any property from the plaintiff, \nand further stated that the property described in the complaint exclusively \nbelonged to the estate of the deceased Antonino de Guzman and Gregoria de la \nCruz, and that their heirs now held it quietly, peaceably, and without any \ninterruption whatever, as owners thereof jointly with the heirs of the deceased \nAndres de Guzman; that the plaintiff perverted the facts when he testified that \nthe defendants had leased the property in 1895 and had paid him rental therefor \nfrom 1896 to 1901, but had failed to do so for the succeeding years to date; \nthat on December 13, 1907, the plaintiff brought suit against Andres de Guzman, \nas the lessee, for the restitution of the possession of the property, but that \nthe complaint was dismissed on account of lack of jurisdiction of the justice of \nthe peace; that about March 29, 1895, Andres de Guzman, a coheir of the \ndefendants, received from the plaintiff, as a loan, the sum of P300, to be \nrepaid within one year with interest at the rate of PS per month, although in \nthe instrument this latter amount was stipulated as rental under the security of \nthe said property, which the debtor Andres possessed pro indiviso and in common \nwith his coheirs, also defendants herein, and which the former so encumbered \nwithout the knowledge or consent of the latter, but that the plaintiff knew of \nthe right and interest that Andres de Guzman had in the said property.<\/p>\n<p>As a counterclaim he alleged that the administratrix, Virginia de Vera, \noffered in the name of the defendants to pay the debt and the interest thereon \nfor the redemption of the share of the property belonging to the deceased Andres \nde Guzman, inasmuch as the defendants, as the owners of the property held in \ncommon, had a perfect right to redeem the said share by paying the price \ntherefor and the interest. He therefore prayed that the defendants be absolved \nfrom the complaint; that the court hold that the house and land, the subject \nmatter of the possessory information proceedings instituted by Andres de Guzman, \nbelong exclusively to the surviving heirs of Antonino de Guzman and Gregoria, de \nla Cruz, with the costs against the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>After a hearing in the case and the introduction of evidence by both parties, \nthe court rendered the judgment aforementioned.<\/p>\n<p>This action is for the recovery of a lot or parcel of land with the house \nsituated thereon, the possession of which its owner, Ildefonso Tambunting, lost \nupon the death of his tenant, Andres de Guzman, which occurred about three years \nbefore 1913, that is, in 1910, by reason of the said property having been \noccupied by some of the latter's relatives who claimed to have a right and share \ntherein.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff bases his right of action on the fact that he acquired \nownership of the said property through the lapse of the conventional period of \none year within which the vendor, Andres de Guzman, should have redeemed the \nproperty, which was sold under rifeht of repurchase in accordance with the \nstipulations made in the public instrument executed before a notary on March \n29,1895.<\/p>\n<p>The vendor Guzman continued to occupy the property even after the vendee's \nownership had been consolidated, by virtue of a contract of lease which forms \npart of that purchase and sale of the said property under right of redemption, \nand at a rental of \u00a5\u00b03 per month; all of which facts are set forth in this \nlatter instrument, provisionally recorded in the property registry on December \n17, 1901, and found on page 28 of record No. 880, exhibited at the trial of this \ncase.<\/p>\n<p>Although the plaintiff acquired absolute ownership of the said property on \nMarch 30, 1896, on account of the vendor's failure to repurchase it, yet he \npermitted the latter to continue to occupy it, as a lessee, until the month of \nDecember, 1907, when the plaintiff brought suit in the justice of the peace \ncourt for the recovery of possession of the said property and the rents owing \nthereon for the months of August to November, inclusive. These proceedings, \nhowever, were subsequently dismissed because the question as to the title of \nreal property was raised. The complaint that gave rise to the present case was \nthen filed.<\/p>\n<p>In order to show that the vendor, Andres de Guzman, was the owner of the \nproperty sold and could freely dispose of it, the plaintiff, Tambunting, \nexhibited an authentic copy, attested by the registrar of the north district of \nManila, of the possessory information proceedings instituted by Guzman in the \nCourt of First Instance of this city. In this document it is set forth that the \nsaid vendor inherited the lot described in the \"information,\" from his deceased \nfather Antonino de Guzman in September 1876, and that he constructed thereon a \nstrong-material house, at his own expense, in September, 1879. This possessory \ninformation was approved by the court on condition that it should be without \nprejudice to any third person having a better right and the court ordered it \nentered in the property registry.<\/p>\n<p>Against the allegation of the defendants that the said property had belonged \nto their deceased ascendents, Antonino de Guzman and Gregoria de la Cruz, and \nwas now held by them jointly as its coowners and the successors of these latter, \nand that they were entitled to redeem it by removing the incumbrance upon it by \npayment to the plaintiff of the sum received from him by their coheir, Andres de \nGuzman, now deceased, and of the interest thereon at the rate of TS per month, \nconsidered as rent, we have the findings of the judgment of the lower court to \nthe effect that no evidence was presented as to what property Antonino de Guzman \nleft at his death, except the testimony of Virginia cle Vera, who claimed the \naforesaid house and land, though she did not explain why she did not commence to \npay the taxes thereon until the year 1911, for those pertaining to the previous \nyears up to 1910 were paid by the plaintiff, and that, furthermore, the \ndefendants presented no evidence of their alleged offer to pay the plaintiff the \nrepurchase price in accordance with the stipulations of the instrument of \nsale.<\/p>\n<p>The trial judge, therefore, accepted as true the statements made by Andres de \nGuzman in the proceedings had for obtaining the said possessory information, \nwhich was approved and recorded in the property registry in March, 1895, to the \neffect that, the land concerned in that title had been inherited by him from his \ndeceased father, Antonino de Guzman, and that in the same month, two years \nthereafter, he constructed on the land the house aforementioned. He accordingly \narrived at the conclusion that the plaintiff was the owner and entitled to \npossession of the land and improvements described in the complaint and in the \ninstrument executed by Andres de Guzman in favor of the plaintiff, Ildefonso \nTambunting, said property being situated in Calle Benavides and designated in \nExhibit D as Nos. 723 to 725, lots 17 and 18, block 14.<\/p>\n<p>It is impossible to review this finding of the trial judge or the facts from \nwhich it is derived in view of the errors assigned by the appellants to the \njudgment appealed from, inasmuch as the stenographic notes taken of the \ntestimony of the witnesses examined during the trial of the case and transmitted \nwith the record to this court were not transcribed into the official language. \nThese untranscribed notes cannot be read at all and the failure to transcribe \nthem is equivalent to a complete absence of oral evidence, for they were not \nsubmitted in proper and available form for the interested parties and all other \nparticipants in this suit.<\/p>\n<p>It is a fixed principle, established by this court in accordance with \nexisting legal provisions governing civil procedure and now become a rule of \nlaw, that the appellant who desires to obtain in second instance a review of the \nevidence presented at the trial had in the Court of First Instance, must have \nsuch evidence forwarded entire to this court. He cannot be permitted to forward \nonly a part of it and then ask that the judgment appealed from be reversed on \nthe ground that it is not supported by the evidence presented at the trial. In \nsuch a case the appellate court is compelled to accept the findings of fact and \nthe conclusions in the decision of the lower court, as occurs in the present \ncase. It is to be observed that, by the mere fact of forwarding only the \nuntranscribed stenographic notes, intelligible only to the stenographer who \nwrote them, such requirement is not fulfilled and the omission or failure to \ntranscribe the said notes amounts to failure to forward the evidence contained \nin them for, though the said notes are included in the record, they are not \nproperly transcribed into Spanish or English.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from this, the claim of prescription put forward by the appellee is \nwell founded, on account of the lapse of more than ten years counting from the \ndate when he purchased the property in question, the possession of which, \nmaterially enjoyed in his name by the lessee, Andres de Guzman, was held by him \nin good faith through a proper conveyance, though suspended during the course of \nthe period fixed for the redemption. However, for the reasons set forth in the \npreceding paragraphs, this alleged prescription need not be considered and the \njudgment appealed from must be affirmed.<\/p>\n<p>The said judgment is, therefore, hereby affirmed, with the costs against the \nappellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson, Moreland, Trent,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, \nJJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/div>",

The plaintiffs therefore prayed that the defendants be ordered \nto make immediate delivery to them of the one-half of the said land and to pay \nthe amount of the aforementioned damages and the costs of the suit.\n<p>The first two defendants, as well as the third, in their respective answers \ndenied the plaintiffs' allegation of ownership and possession of the land in \nquestion and their having acquired it by purchase, as set forth in the \ncomplaint, and alleged on the contrary that while the first two defendants were \nstill owners of the said land they sold it, on January 28, 1910, by a public \ninstrument, to the other defendant, Basilides Ilayat, who since that time had \nhad quiet, peaceable and uninterrupted possession; and that, as the land was \npart of a larger tract which the father of the first two defendants owned \njointly with one Felipe Bartido, this latter had kept the possessory information \nor title deed of the land in dispute and had afterwards connived with the \nplaintiffs to prejudice the defendants by making it appear that he had sold it \nto the plaintiffs. The defendants therefore prayed that they be absolved from \nthe complaint, with the costs against the plaintiffs, and that in addition, the \nlatter be sentenced to indemnify defendants respectively in the sum of P200 for \nthe damages occasioned them by the filing of the complaint.<\/p>\n<p>After the introduction of evidence by both parties, the lower court absolved \nthe defendants from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiffs. The \ngrounds of the judgment were that the contract of sale of the said land, on \nwhich the plaintiffs had based their action, was ineffective, null and void, \nbecause it had not been made in writing, and that, even though such sale in \nfavor of the plaintiffs were actually made, that effected by the two defendants \nto the other defendant, Basilides Ilayat, should prevail, for the reason that it \nwas made previously and was set forth in a written instrument. From this \njudgment the plaintiffs excepted and at the same time moved for a new trial. \nTheir motion was denied, an exception was taken to the ruling and, through a \nbill of exceptions, the case was brought before this court on appeal.<\/p>\n<p>The question raised before us by the appellants in their assignments of error \nturns upon the weight given the evidence submitted by them, which the lower \ncourt held to be insufficient and incompetent to prove the complaint. <\/p>\n<p>The complaint was based on the plaintiffs' allegation that they were the \nowners of the land in question because they had purchased it from the defendants \nAlejandro and Antonio Ilayat and Felipe Bartido, and to prove the purchase they \npresented three witnesses, among them Bartido himself and one of the plaintiffs \nwho, over the objection and exception of the defendants, testified affirmatively \non this point. The plaintiffs also presented a copy of the summary passes spry \ninformation relative to the said land; that had been instituted at the instance \nof and approved in favor of Felipe Bartido and Santiago Ilayat, the latter being \nthe father of two of the defendants. The plaintiffs and Latina Bartido, another \nwitness, testified that, instead of the sale being recorded in another written \ninstrument as the plaintiffs themselves desired, this instrument was delivered \nto the plaintiffs upon the execution of the sale.<\/p>\n<p>Since the enactment of Act No. 190, the Code of Civil Procedure, a contract \nof sale of realty cannot be proven by means of witnesses, but must necessarily \nbe evidenced by a written instrument, duly subscribed by the party charged, or \nby his agent, or by secondary evidence of the contents of such document. No \nother evidence, therefore, can be received except the documentary evidence \nreferred to, in so far as regards such contracts, and these are valueless as \nevidence unless they are drawn up in writing in the manner aforesaid. (Sec. 335, \nCode of Civil Procedure.)<\/p>\n<p>The facts upon which the complaint is based cannot be considered as proven, \nbecause the plaintiffs only presented the testimony of witnesses to prove that \nthe land sought to be recovered by them in this suit was sold to them by the \ndefendants, Antonio and Alejandro Ilayat, and by Felipe Bartido. To prove the \nsale, the documentary evidence before mentioned cannot be substituted by the \ncopy of the possessory information which, according to the plaintiffs, was \ndelivered to them by the defendants. Furthermore, the plaintiffs did not prove \nthat the possession of the said land was delivered to them by those two \ndefendants and Felipe Bartido, as alleged in the complaint in corroboration of \nthe alleged sale.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants presented at the trial the document found on pages 10, 11, 12, \nand 13 of that part of the record entitled \"Documents of the Parties.\" This \ndocument, marked \"Exhibit A\" of the defendants, appears to have been executed on \nJanuary 28, 1910, in Batac, Province of Ilocos Norte, and witnesses that two of \nthe defendants, Antonio and Alejandro Ilayat, sold the land in question to the \nother defendant, Basilides Ilayat, for the sum of F600, Philippine currency, \npaid by this latter to the two former. The document is signed by the three \nparties first above-named and by the witnesses Agustin Andres and Eulalio Bareng \nand was certified before Santiago Espiritu, notary public of Batac, on December \n9,1910. The defendants tried to prove by means of this instrument that the owner \nof the disputed land was one of them, Basilides Ilayat, and that the sale made \nto him appeared in writing.<\/p>\n<p>In view of this evidence the court held as aforesaid that even granting that \nthe land was actually sold to the plaintiffs as alleged in the complaint, the \nsale to Basilides Ilayat must prevail, because it was made previously and was \nrecorded in a written instrument. This is, undoubtedly, but another reason for \nthe dismissal of the complaint. However, a close examination of the document \nmentioned discloses that in referring therein to the personal certificate of \nregistration of the supposed purchaser, Basilides Ilayat, exhibited in the \ncourse of the proceeding which, according to the date of the document, was had \non January 28, 1910, the statement is made that the said certificate, No. \n1409413, was issued by the municipal treasurer of the municipality of Batac on \nFebruary 21, 1910. This clearly shows that the document in question could not \nhave been executed on January 28, 1910, but on some date subsequent to that of \nFebruary 21 of the same year, for the simple Reason that on January 28, 1910, \nBasilides Ilayat could nor have had in his possession the certificate which, as \nstated in the said document, he exhibited in that proceeding and on that \nparticular date, as this certificate was issued twenty-three days afterwards, to \nwit, on the 21st of the following month of February. Nor can any error be \nattributed to the reference made in the document of the date of the issuance of \nthe certificate of registration, for, as may also be seen on page 13 of the \nrecord of documentary evidence, in the ratification of the deed of sale which \nappears to have been made by the three defendants before the notary of Batac, on \nDecember 9, 1910, that is, eleven months afterwards,\u2014a circumstance in itself \nwhich leads us to suspect that it was not executed on the date shown on its \nface,\u2014in the mention of the personal certificates of registration exhibited by \nthe affiants, it is stated that Basilides Ilayat's cedula is numbered 1409413 \nand was issued on February 21, 1910, that is, it bears the same date and number \nas that mentioned in the deed of sale.<\/p>\n<p>By reason of the foregoing, and because the evidence presented by the \nplaintiffs is insufficient, the defendants are absolved from the complaint, the \njudgment appealed from being thus affirmed, without special finding as to \ncosts.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C J., Torres, Moreland,<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> \nconcur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

Grey meant and intended to \nstate and represent to those to whom the said defendants delivered said \ncirculars as aforesaid, that the said Insular Life Insurance Company was then \nand there in a dangerous financial condition and on the point of going into \ninsolvency, to the detriment of the policy holders of the said Insular Life \nInsurance Company, and of those with whom the said Insular Life Insurance \nCompany have and have had business transactions, and each and all of said \npersons to whom the said defendants delivered said circulars, and all persons as \nwell who read said circulars understood the said matters in said circulars to \nhave said libelous sense and meaning. Contrary to law.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On the 20th day of December, 1912, the plaintiff, together with the other \npersons named as accused in said process, through their attorneys, served upon \nthe prosecuting attorney and filed with the clerk of the court a motion to quash \nsaid summons and the service thereof, on the ground that the court had no \njurisdiction over the said company, there being no authority in the court for \nthe issuance of the process, Exhibit B, the order under which it was issued \nbeing void. The court denied the motion and directed plaintiff to appear before \nit on the 28th day of December, 1912, and to plead to the information, to which \norder the plaintiff then and there duly excepted.<\/p>\n<p>It is alleged in the complaint that \"unless restrained by this Court the \nrespondent will proceed to carry out said void order and compel your petitioner \nto appear before his court and plead, and submit to criminal prosecution without \nhaving acquired any jurisdiction whatever over your petitioner.\"<\/p>\n<p>The prayer of the complaint is, \"your petitioner prays judgment for the, \nissuance of a writ of prohibition against the respondent, commanding the \nrespondent absolutely to desist or refrain from further proceedings against your \npetitioner in the said criminal action,\"<\/p>\n<p>The basis of the action is that the Court of First Instance has no power or \nauthority, under the laws of the Philippine Islands, to proceed against a \ncorporation, as such, criminally, to bring it into court for the purpose of \nmaking it amenable to the criminal laws. It is contended that the court had no \njurisdiction to issue the process in evidence against the plaintiff corporation; \nthat the issuance and service thereof upon the plaintiff corporation were \noutside of the authority and jurisdiction of the court, were authorized by no \nlaw, conferred no jurisdiction over said corporation, and that theywere \nabsolutely void and without force or effect.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff, further attacking said process, alleges that the process is a \nmixture of civil and criminal process, that it is not properly signed, that it \ndoes not direct or require an arrest; that it is an order to appear and answer \non a date certain without restraint of the person, and that it is not in the \nform required by law.<\/p>\n<p>Section 5 of General Orders, No. 58, defines an information as \"an accusation \nin writing charging a person with a public offense.\" Section 6 provides that a \ncomplaint or information is sufficient if it shows \"the name of the defendant, \nor if his name cannot be discovered, that he is described under a fictitious \nname with a statement that his true name is unknown to the informant or official \nsigning the same. His true name may be inserted at any stage of the proceedings \ninstituted against him; whenever ascertained.\" These provisions, as well as \nthose which relate to arraignment and counsel, and to demurrers and pleas, \nindicate clearly that the maker of the Code of Criminal Procedure had no \nintention or expectation that corporations would be included among those who \nwould fall within the provisions thereof. The only process known to the Code of \nCriminal Procedure, or which any court is by that order authorized to issue, is \nan order of arrest. The Code of Criminal Procedure provides that \"if the \nmagistrate be satisfied from the investigation that the crime complained of has \nbeen committed, and there is reasonable ground to believe that the party charged \nhas committed it, he must issue <em>an order for his arrest.<\/em> If the offense \nbe bailable, and the defendant offer a sufficient security, he shall be admitted \nto bail; otherwise he shall be committed to prison.\" There is no authority for \nthe issuance of any other process than an order of arrest. As a necessary \nconsequence, the process issued in the case before us is without \n<em>express<\/em> authorization of statute.<\/p>\n<p>The question remains as to whether or not the court may, of itself and on its \nown motion, create not only a process but a procedure by which the process may \nbe made effective. <\/p>\n<p>We do not believe that the authority of the courts of the Philippine Islands \nextends so far. While having the inherent powers which usually go with courts of \ngeneral jurisdiction, we are of the opinion that, under the circumstances of \ntheir creation, they have only such authority in criminal matters as is \nexpressly conferred upon them by statute or which it is necessary to imply from \nsuch authority in order to carry out fully and adequately the express authority \nconferred. We do not feel that Courts of First Instance have authority to create \nnew procedure and new processes in criminal law. The exercise of such power \nverges too closely on legislation. Even though it be admitted, a question we do \nnot now decide, that there are various penal laws in the Philippine Islands \nwhich corporations as such may violate, still we do not believe that the courts \nare authorized to go to the extent of creating special procedure and special \nprocesses for the purpose of carrying out those penal statutes, when the \nlegislature itself has neglected to do so. To bring a corporation into court \ncriminally requires many additions to the present criminal procedure. While it \nmay be said to be the duty of courts to see to it that criminals are punished, \nit is no less their duty to follow prescribed forms of procedure and not to go \nout upon unauthorized ways or act in an unauthorized manner.<\/p>\n<p>There are many cases cited by counsel for the defendant which show that \ncorporations have been proceeded against criminally by indictment and otherwise \nand have been punished as malefactors by the courts. Of this, of course, there \ncan be no doubt; but it is clear that, in those cases, the statute, by express \nwords or by necessary intendment, included corporations within the persons who \ncould offend against the criminal laws; and the legislature, at the same time \nestablished a procedure applicable to corporations. No case has been cited to us \nwhere a corporation has been proceeded against under a criminal statute where \nthe court did not exercise its common law powers or where there was not in force \na special procedure applicable to corporations.<\/p>\n<p>The courts of the Philippine Islands are creatures of statute and, as we have \nsaid, have only those powers conferred upon them by statute and those which are \nrequired to exercise that authority fully and adequately. The courts here have \nno common law jurisdiction or powers. If they have any powers not conferred by \nstatute, expressly or impliedly, they would naturally come from Spanish and not \nfrom common law sources. It is undoubted that, under the Spanish criminal law \nand procedure, a corporation could not have been proceeded against criminally, \nas such, if such an entity as a corporation in fact existed under the Spanish \nlaw, and as such it could not have committed a crime in which a willful purpose \nor a malicious intent was required. Criminal actions would have been restricted \nor limited, under that system, to the officials of such corporations and never \nwould have been directed against the corporation itself. This was the rule with \nrelation to associations or combinations of persons approaching, more or less, \nthe corporation as it is now understood, and it would undoubtedly have been the \nrule with corporations. From this source, then, the courts derive no authority \nto bring corporations before them in criminal actions, nor to issue processes \nfor that purpose.<br\/><br\/>The case was submitted to this Court on an agreed \nstatement of facts with a stipulation for a decision upon the merits. We are of \nthe opinion that the plaintiff is entitled, under that stipulation, to the \nremedy prayed for.<\/p>\n<p>It is adjudged that the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila be and \nit is hereby enjoined and prohibited from proceeding further in the criminal \ncause which is before us in this proceeding, entitled United States vs. West \nCoast Life Insurance Company, a corporation, John Northcott and Manuel C. Grey, \nso far as said proceedings relate to the said West Coast Life Insurance Company, \na corporation, the plaintiff in the case.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

I., did in \nJanuary, 1913, and prior and subsequent thereto, become interested and take \ndirect part willfully, unlawfully, and criminally in the fishery business of the \nmunicipality of which he was president, having at said time and place leased \nvarious fishponds. In violation of law.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>After trial, judgment was rendered by said Court of First Instance, under \ndate of April 4 of the same year, sentencing the defendant, as guilty of the \nviolation of said section 28 of the Municipal Code, to six months' imprisonment \nand payment of the costs. Said defendant has appealed therefrom, alleging as his \ndefense in this instance that the court erred in making various findings of fact \nin the judgment and in declaring that such facts constituted a clear violation \nof the section cited and in-imposing upon the defendant the penalty set \nforth.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"No municipal officer,' says said section 28 [as amended by section 1 of Act \nNo, 663],. \"shall be directly or indirectly interested in any contract work, or \ncockpits, or any other permitted games and amusements, or business of the \nmunicipality, or in the purchase of any real estate or any other property \nbelonging to the corporation,\" and further states that violation of said \nprovision shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than six months nor \nmore than two years.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It is plainly proven: (1) That the defendant was appointed municipal \npresident of the municipality of Magsingal on October 28, 1912, on which date he \nentered upon the duties of his office, and while on duty as said president, the \nmunicipal council on December 9 of the same year, 1912, and under his \npresidency, approved and passed Regulation No. 7, for the leasing of fishponds \nin the said municipality, article 10 whereof provided that the lease holders of \nvarious sections of said fishponds, among which was section 102, should continue \nin their leases so long as they paid the rental fixed for each of the respective \nsections, without prejudice to granting them to others who might desire to bid \nfor them, in case such leaseholders should waive their preferential right \n(Exhibit 1 of the defense); (2) that on the 16th of the said month of December, \nwhen the auction or bidding for the different sections of said fishponds was \nheld in the town hall of said municipality, it was recorded in Minute No. 54, \nseries of 1912, entered for that purpose (folio 13, back of 13 and folio 14 of \nthe Minute Book, Exhibit A of the prosecution), that the accused, who \nparticipated therein and moreover presided over the auction, took part in the \nbidding for the said section No. 102 of the fishpond of Pagsanaan, and that that \nsection was adjudicated to him as the highest bidder for the sum of two pesos a \nyear; (3) that said defendant paid the municipal treasurer of Magsingal on \nJanuary 10 of the following year, 1913, the sum of T2 as the price of the lease \nfor the said section No. 102 up to the close of that year; (4) that said \ndefendant, who held the office of president of the said municipality from \nOctober 28, 1912, as has already been stated, and who still held it on March 30, \n1914, when this case was tried, continued in the lease of the said section No. \n102 of said fishpond, which was awarded to htm on December 16; 1912, until the \nsame month of December of said year 1913, that is, for a period of one year.<\/p>\n<p>Defendant attempted to exculpate himself by saying that when he was appointed \nmunicipal president of Magsingal in October, 1912, and began to discharge the \nduties of said office, he already held in lease the said section 102 of the \nfishpond of Pagsanaan, belonging to that municipality, and that he did not take \npart in the bidding held in the month of December of the same year for securing \nsaid lease, but that he continued in the enjoyment of this right by virtue of a \nresolution of the municipal council, which has been mentioned above, whereby it \nwas provided that those who, like himself, held fishponds of the municipality on \nlease should continue in the same, provided they offered the rental fixed at the \nbidding that would take place. But what the defendant says in his defense is not \nsufficiently proven, for it does not appear in the Minute Book presented at the \ntrial, nor from any fact submitted thereat, that before he became municipal \npresident of Magsingal he held the lease of section 102, already set forth. On \nthe contrary, it appears, as, has been stated above, in Minute No. 54, series of \n1912, of the auction or bidding held on December 16 of the same year that the \ndefendant was then awarded the lease of the said section 102 for the sum of P2 a \nyear as the highest bidder. His allegations in that connection cannot, \ntherefore, favor him in any way, or constitute ground of defense to relieve him \nof the responsibility he has incurred, for whether or not he held the lease of \nthe said property of the municipality of Magsingal before entering upon the \nduties of his office as president of that municipality, the concrete and \ndefinite fact proven at the trial is that while he was municipal president of \nMagsingal he was interested in business of said municipality by leasing on \nDecember 16, 1912, a piece of property belonging thereto and continued in the \nlease he had held of that same property before assuming said office, which in \nthis case amounts to the same thing, for such action is definitely prohibited by \nsection 28 of the Municipal Code. The defendant's conduct is so much the more \ncensurable, if it be accepted as true that before becoming municipal president \nof Magsingal he already held the said property of that municipality in lease and \nmerely continued in the enjoyment of said right after entering upon the duties \nof the office and for a year longer, that is, all of the year 1913, in so far as \nit appears by the Minute of December 9, 1912, that the municipal council, on \nthat date and under his presidency, passed the resolution regarding the \npreference to be given to the then leaseholders of various sections of said \nfishpond, among which was No. 102, over any other bidders at the auction to be \nheld, as it was held on the 16th of the same month, provided that they paid in \nthe rental fixed therefor, for the defendant took advantage of said preference \nin the bidding when it was he who, as president of the municipality, in \nconnection with the other members of the council, had adopted that resolution. \nThis very fact ought to have obligated him for reasons not only of legality but \nof delicacy and morality not to continue in the lease and not to become \ninterested again in that business of the municipality, and yet he did become \ninterested therein until the end of December of the following year, 1913, thus \nopenly violating the law, which has attempted by means of the precept contained \nin said section 28 of the Municipal Code to prevent the interests of the \nmunicipality or the town intrusted to the administration of the municipal \nofficers from suffering detriment by coming into conflict with the interests of \nsuch administrators, which would doubtless occur if said officers should lease \nproperty of their respective municipalities, as they are the very persons whose \nduty it is to set or fix the price of the lease, the time of its payment, and \nthe conditions of the corresponding contract. The defendant himself must have so \nunderstood it, although tardily, as is demonstrated by the fact that he excused \nhimself on grounds of delicacy, for the reason that he was one of the then \nleaseholders of the fishponds of the municipality, that is, section No. 102, \nfrom taking part in Resolution No. 202, adopted at the session of December 15, \n1913, Exhibit 2 of the defense, with reference to the concession to those who \nthen held leases of various sections of the fishponds, among which was included \nthe said No. 102, of the right to transfer the enjoyment of the lease, a right \nthat the defendant made use of five days later, that is, on the 20th of the same \nmonth of December, by transferring the lease he had to section No. 19, as \nappears in, Resolution No. 206 (back of folio 85 of the Minute Book, Exhibit A), \nto one Miguel Udarbe, really a nephew of his. This section must be the same as \nNo. 102, for in addition to being in the Pagsanaan Lake, it does not appear that \nthe defendant held any other section of that lake in lease, and thus he has \ngiven to understand by his defense in first instance, presenting as Exhibit 4 \nthereof the said resolution.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, to maintain that the fact alleged in the complaint does not \nconstitute a crime or a violation of section 28 of the Municipal Code, the \ndefense has in its brief cited two opinions rendered by the Attorney-General in \nconnection with said section, one of May 5, 1909 (Opinions of the \nAttorney-General, vol. 5, p. 70), and another on the 22d of the same month of \n1902 (ibid., vol. 1, p. 204).<\/p>\n<p>The first was in reply to the question whether said section, as amended by \nAct No. 663, should be construed in the sense that it prohibited municipal \nofficers from attending the cock-fights or public billiard rooms, to participate \nin said games and not to perform there their official duties. The \nAttorney-General said no, for the reason that, while the purpose of the law was \nto secure the faithfulness of said officers in the performance of their official \nduties, it could not interfere in matters connected with the strictly private \nrights of those same officers, whose responsibility in the case of a charge of \ngambling, he added, would be a question of fact to be determined in each \nparticular instance, since the status of a municipal councilor under the law is \nthe same as that of any other private party.<\/p>\n<p>The second opinion of the Attorney-General cited by the defense refers to a \nquery submitted to him with reference to whether the municipal officers, by \nelection or by appointment, could enter into contracts with the municipal \ncouncil regarding the lease of realty belonging to them for the use of their \nmunicipality, without infringing section 28 of the Municipal Code.<\/p>\n<p>In reply to that query the Attorney-General very correctly stated that the \npurpose of such legal provision was to prevent fraud; that to permit the \nmunicipal officers to become directly or indirectly interested in the contracts \nor commercial transactions of the municipality could easily, in view of their \ninfluence, operate to the effect that such contracts or business should be \nawarded to them under conditions less advantageous for the municipality by \npreventing competition on the part of others, and besides, after the contracts \nhad been awarded to them, they might not fulfill the conditions therein \nstipulated, in this way prejudicing the municipality's interests. He added that \nthe leasing of realty to the municipality could not be regarded as embraced in \nthe contracts and business mentioned in sections 39 and 40 of the Municipal \nCode, such as construction of buildings, installation and maintenance of lights, \netc., for the reason that in such contracts of lease that fraud which the law \nseeks to prevent could not take place. And finally, noting that article 397 of \nthe Penal Code punishes as guilty of fraud the public officer who becomes \ndirectly or indirectly interested in any kind of contract or operation in which \nhe has to intervene because of his office, he concluded by saying that in order \nto be included in this legal provision it was merely necessary that the officer \nintervene in the contract or transaction by reason of his office, and therefore, \nas the leasing of any property by the municipality for its own use must be the \nsubject of a resolution of the municipal council, all the officers who take part \nin the deliberations of said council, to wit, the president, vice president, and \nthe councilors, are prohibited from leasing their property to the \nmunicipality.<\/p>\n<p>If the citation of the first opinion of the Attorney-General, made by the \ndefense, is absolutely inapplicable to the instance dealt with in this case, the \nsecond is also, but in the opposite sense to that claimed by the defense itself, \nfor the same reason exists why a municipal officer cannot lease property of his \nown to the municipality as. why he cannot lease property from the \nmunicipality.<\/p>\n<p>Article 397 of the Penal Code punishes the same thing as is penalized by \nsubsection (b) of section 28 of the Municipal Code, to wit, the action, of a \npublic official in the former and of a municipal officer in the latter, of \nbecoming interested in any kind of contract or operation in which he must \nintervene by reason of his office. In performing such an action, as Viada says \nin his commentaries on the Penal Code, the officer does nothing more than \nviolate a prohibition; hence no fraud exists therein, but there does exist the \npossibility that he may perpetrate fraud, or at least that he may subordinate \nthe state's interest to his own. In connection with the municipality, this is \ncertainly the reason why said section 28 of the Municipal Code prohibits \nmunicipal officers from taking part directly or indirectly in contracts, \ncockpits, or other permitted games and amusements or in business of the \nmunicipality.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant became interested and took direct part in the leasing of \nproperty of the municipality of Magsingal, wherein he had to intervene by reason \nof his office as president of said municipality, and he has therefore openly \nviolated the provisions of said section of the Municipal Code. <\/p>\n<p>The lower court did not, therefore, incur any error in holding in the \njudgment appealed from that the guilt of the defendant had been proven and in \nimposing upon him the corresponding penalty, in accordance with the provision in \nsaid section.<\/p>\n<p>Wherefore, we affirm the judgment appealed from, with the costs against the \nappellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

FAUSTO RAYMUNDO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila in \nfavor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the possession of certain \nreal property described in the complaint and for the sum of P25 per month from \nthe 12th day of June 1913 until the property is returned, and for the sum of P6, \nthe costs of the transfer of the tenant's personal property, and for the costs \nof the action.\n<p>From the evidence in the case it appears that Vicente Rodriguez and Gregoria \nBaroto Cruz, his wife, were in possession of the real property described in the \ncomplaint and that this property, together with several other pieces of real \nestate, had been the subject of a loan by the owners from one Alfonso Debrunner \nto the amount of P1,750, and that on the 3d of March, 1913, the owners sold the \nproperty described in the complaint, together with other properties, to the \nplaintiff herein for the sum of P2,800, plaintiff to pay the said Alfonso \nDebrunner the sum of P1,750 due him, the balance to be paid to the vendors. The \nplaintiff immediately entered into possession of the property and leased the \nsame to one Trinidad Maranga, who immediately took and remained in possession \nuntil she was ousted by the sheriff of the city of Manila under an execution \nissued on a judgment procured in an action brought by the defendant in this case \nagainst the said Vicente Rodriguez and Gregoria Baroto Cruz, in which action \nneither the plaintiff nor her tenant was a party.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant justifies his entry upon the premises and the ouster of \nplaintiff's tenant upon the ground of a sale of the property to him on the 1st \nMay, 1911, at which time it appears he purchased the property described in the \ncomplaint under a <em>pacto de retro<\/em> for the sum of P400, the period of \nredemption being one year. There was no redemption within the year but the \ndefendant extended the time within which the redemption might be made without \nfixing a limit to the extension. The sale with the right to repurchase was not \nregistered in the registry of property and no attempt was made to register it \nuntil the 9th day of June, 1913, some time after this action was begun, at which \ntime registry was refused for the reason that the property had never been, \nregistered in the name of the vendors.<\/p>\n<p>It thus appears that Vicente Rodriguez and Gregoria Baroto Cruz sold the same \nproperty to two different individuals, namely, the defendant on the 1st of May, \n1911, the sale being with the right to repurchase, and to the plaintiff on the \n3d of March, 1913. The sale to the defendant was not registered and no entry was \nmade either upon the certificate of title by which Vicente Rodriguez and \nGregoria Baroto Cruz held title to the property at that time or in the registry \nof property; whereas the sale td the plaintiff, although made some two years \nlater, was duly registered as required by law. The property in question being \nproperty duly registered under the Torrens system (Act No. 496) the question \narises what effect has a prior unregistered transfer on a subsequent registered \ntransfer made for value and in good faith.<\/p>\n<p>The provisions of Act No. 496 made the resolution of this question very \nsimple. Section 50 of that Act provides in part: \"But no deed, mortgage, lease, \nor other voluntary instrument, except a will, purporting to convey or affect \nregistered land, shall take effect as a conveyance or bind the land, but shall \noperate only as a contract between the parties and as evidence of authority to \nthe clerk or register of deeds to make registration. <em>The act of registration \nshall be the operative act to convey and affect the land<\/em>, and in all cases \nunder this Act the registration shall be made in the office of register of deeds \nfor the province or provinces or city where the land lies.\"<br\/><br\/>In accordance \nwith this section, no act of the parties themselves can transfer the ownership \nof real estate under the Torrens system. That is done by the act of registration \nof the conveyance which the parties have made. It is clear, therefore, that the \nproperty in question, so far as the plaintiff is concerned, was not transferred \nby the conveyance from Vicente Rodriguez and Gregoria Baroto Cruz to the \ndefendant in 1911. Their instrument amounted simply to a contract for a \nconveyance which would become a conveyance when it was registered in accordance \nwith the requirements of Act No. 496. Being nothing more than a contract for the \nsale of land, it had no effect upon the purchase made by the plaintiff in 1913, \nshe having bought for value and in good faith and her conveyance having duly \nregistered as required by law.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The plaintiff, in turn, moved that this petition be \ndenied; that the sale to which the petitioners referred be declared to be null \nand void; that the contract be rescinded on the ground that one of the alleged \nvendors is a minor; and that the partition requested by the plaintiff be \nproceeded with.<\/p>\n<p>Eugenia Agbayani also appeared at the trial and alleged that she was entitled \nto a share in the property whose partition was sought by the plaintiff because \nshe was the heir to her son, Andres Vicente Dancel, had by the late Domingo \nDancel, a brother of the plaintiff and of the defendants, and also because she \nhad taken no part in the alienation of the aforementioned properties to the \ninterveners. She therefore prayed that the court direct that partition be made \nin equal shares among all the heirs of the deceased Manuel Dancel and that the \nsaid conveyances made to the interveners be declared null and void. These \npetitions were opposed by the interveners.<\/p>\n<p>Upon the introduction of evidence by the respective parties, the court, after \nentertaining various considerations relative to the propriety of the partition \nrequested by the plaintiff and to the fact that the interveners could not be \ndeprived of their property upon the ground of the nullity of the sales made to \nthem of some of the lands mentioned in the complaint, unless a decision were \nfirst rendered on the matter in an action brought for the purpose, rendered the \njudgment, the dispositive part of which reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"For the foregoing reasons the court decrees: (1) That Buenaventura Dancel \nmay distribute his property among his brothers and sister, including Eugenia \nAgbayani, if all the facts set forth in his petition are found to be true; (2) \nthat the lands sold to the interveners, Lucas Salvador, Pedro Soriano, Pedro \nSalvador, Pedro Medina, Prisca del Prado, Roque Garma, Cosme Suguitan, Hilaria \nRuiz, and Macario Baptista, shall be maintained as they are until their status \nbe otherwise determined in the proper suit; and (3) that the plaintiff and the \ndefendants shall pay the costs of this action.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The plaintiff first asked for an explanation, and immediately afterwards a \nreconsideration of the said decision. Both motions being denied, plaintiff \nexcepted to the decision, as well as to the ruling denying his motion for a new \ntrial. The record, by virtue of the appeal raised, was forwarded to this court \nby means of a bill of exceptions.<\/p>\n<p>The appellant alleges that the lower court erred:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"(1) In not ordering the partition of the common property held by the \ndefendants and the plaintiff and not claimed by the interveners.<\/p>\n<p>\"(2) In failing to decide the claim of the intervener, Eugenia Agbayani, that \nshe was entitled to share in the partition solicited by the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>\"(3) In ordering that the lands sold to the interveners should remain in \ntheir possession until otherwise decreed in a proper action.<\/p>\n<p>\"(4) In sentencing the plaintiff to pay the costs.\" First of all, the \naverments made by the appellant in the first two assignments of error are not at \nall well-founded, since, as is seen in the dispositive part of the judgment, it \nwas held that the plaintiff, Buenaventura Dancel, could distribute his property \namong his brothers and sister and Eugenia Agbayani, if all the facts set forth \nin his petition were found to be true. By this the court meant to say that, \nassuming the facts alleged in the complaint to be true, the partition of the \n<em>pro indiviso<\/em> property requested by the plaintiff among himself, his \nbrothers and sister and Eugenia Agbayani, could be made. Although it is true \nthat this finding is somewhat confused and ambiguous in its phraseology and does \nnot appear to have been made with proper precision and exactness, the court \nthereby virtually acceded to the plaintiff's claim.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From the evidence introduced at the trial it appears that, although some of \nthe defendants, sometimes together and at other times separately, and even the \nplaintiff, himself, transferred by sale, not only to the persons who appear \nherein as interveners, but also to others, several of the parcels of land or \nproperties from among those described in the complaint, and with respect to \nwhich property as a whole there exists a summary possessory information which \nwas recorded in the property registry in favor of the plaintiff and the three \ndefendants Dancel and was attached to the record as Exhibit A, still it is not \nshown that any partition or division has yet been made among them of that \nproperty as a whole, which, as disclosed by the possessory information itself, \nbelonged to them all in common, although, in some of the transfers, the \nparticular parcel sold was deemed to belong in partition to the vendor of the \nparticular piece.<\/p>\n<p>In view of this result and of the consent of the three defendants, cotenants \nof the said property, as well as of the petition of Eugenia Agbayani, the widow, \naccording to her statement, of a brother of the defendants, and heir of a son \nhad by that brother, the property referred to in the complaint must be \nconsidered as being still held <em>pro indiviso<\/em> by and among all those who \nclaim to have a right therein.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"No coowner shall be obliged to remain a party to the community. Each of them \nmay ask at any time the division of the thing owned in common.\" (Art. 400, Civil \nCode.)<\/p>\n<p>\"No coheir can be obliged to continue in an undivided inheritance unless the \ntestator should expressly forbid the division.\" (Art. 1051, <em>ibid.<\/em>)<\/p>\n<p>\"Every coowner shall have full ownership of his part and the fruits and \nbenefits derived therefrom, and he therefore may alienate, assign, or mortgage \nit, and even substitute another person in its enjoyment, unless personal rights \nare in question. But the effect of the alienation or mortgage, with regard to \nthe coowners, shall be limited to the share which may be awarded him in the \ndivision on the dissolution of the community.\" (Art. 399, <em>ibid<\/em>.)<\/p>\n<p>\"The creditors or assignees of the coowners may concur in the division of the \nthing owned in common, and object to any division made without their concurrence \n* * * \" (Art. 403, <em>ibid.<\/em>)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Finally, pursuant to section 762 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the \npartition of property held in common and undivided may be made although some of \nthe original tenants or devisees have conveyed their shares to other persons; \nand in that case such shares shall be set to the persons holding the same as \nthey would have been to the heirs or devisees.<\/p>\n<p>It is unquestionable that, in accordance with the legal provisions quoted, \nthe plaintiff has a perfect right to have a division made of the property he \nholds in common and <em>pro indiviso<\/em> with the defendants and with Eugenia \nAgbayani, his coadjutor in the action prosecuted by him. No hindrance to the \nexercise and effectiveness of that right lies in the conveyances made of various \nportions of the said property by some of its cotenants in favor of those persons \nwho have intervened in this suit, for, aside from the fact that the law grants \nthem the right to concur in the division of the thing owned in common and to \nobject to any division made without their consent, it considers them, in an \naction for the partition of real estate, as subrogated to the rights of the \nvendors in the portions of the property in their possession. Therefore the lower \ncourt did not err in ordering that those portions should remain in the \npossession of the interveners until otherwise decreed in a proper action, to \nwit, one brought by any of the parties to annul the alleged sales, or to attack \nthe ownership of the portions sold.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile there is nothing that can or should interfere with proceeding \naccording to the provisions of sections 181 to 196 of the Code of Civil \nProcedure with the action for partition brought by the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>It is therefore held that the plaintiff is entitled to partition of the \nproperty, prayed for in his complaint, among himself, his brothers and sister, \nthe defendants and his coadjutor, Eugenia Agbayani, in the capacity in which she \nappeared; and that the interveners shall not be disturbed in their enjoyment of \nthe ownership and possession of the respective parcels of land conveyed to them \nby the cotenants thereof unless otherwise ordered. In this sense, we affirm the \njudgment appealed from, with the costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The court \nbelow found in favor of the defendant and refused to order the registration of \nthe articles mentioned, maintaining and holding that the defendant, under the \nCorporation Law, had authority to determine both the sufficiency of the form of \nthe articles and the legality of the object of the proposed corporation. This \nappeal is taken from that judgment.<\/p>\n<p>The first question that arises is whether or not the chief of the division of \narchives has authority, under the Corporation Law, on being presented with \narticles of incorporation for registration, to decide not only as to the \nsufficiency of the of the articles, but also as to the lawfulness of the \npurposes of the proposed corporation.<\/p>\n<p>It is strongly urged on the part of the appellants that the duties appellants \nthat the duties of the defendant are purely ministerial and that he has no \nauthority to pass upon the lawfulness, of the object for which the incorporators \npropose to organize. No authorities are cited to support this proposition and we \nare of the opinion that it is not sound.<\/p>\n<p>Section 6 of the Corporation Law reads in part as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Five or more persons, not exceeding fifteen, a majority of whom are \nresidents of the Philippine Islands, may form a private corporation for any \nlawful purpose by filing with the division of archives, patents, copyrights, and \ntrademarks of the Executive Bureau articles of incorporation duly executed and \nacknowledged before a notary public, * * *\" <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Simply because the duties of an official happen to be ministerial, it does \nnot necessarily follow that he may not, in the administration of his office, \ndetermine questions of law. We are of the opinion that it is the duty of the \nwhen articles of incorporation are presented for registration, to determine \nwhether the objects of the corporation expressed in the articles are lawful. We \ndo not believe that, simply because articles of incorporation presented for \nregistration are perfect in form, the division of archives must accept and \nregister them and issue the corresponding certificate of incorporation no matter \nwhat the purpose of the corporation may be as expressed in the articles. We do \nnot believe it was intended that the division of archives should issue a \ncertificate of incorporation to, and thereby put the seal of approval of the \nGovernment upon, a corporation which was organized for base or immoral purposes. \nThat such corporation might later, if it sought to carry out such purposes, be \ndissolved, or its officials imprisoned or itself heavily fined furnishes no \nreason why it should have been created in the first instance. It seems to us to \nbe not only the right but the duty of the division of archives to determine the \nlawfulness of the objects and purposes of the corporation before it issues a \ncertificate of incorporation.<\/p>\n<p>It having been determined that the division of archives, through its \nofficials, has authority to determine not only the sufficiency as to form of the \narticles of incorporation offered for registration, but also the lawfulness of \nthe purposes of the corporation as stated in those articles, the next inquiry \nleads us to the determination of the question whether or not the chief of the \ndivision of archives, who is the representative thereof and clothed by it with \nauthority to deal with articles of incorporation offered for registration, is \nsubject to mandamus in the performance of his duties.<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that he may be mandamused if he act in violation of law \nor if he refuses, unduly, to comply with the law. While we have held that \ndefendant has power to pass upon the lawfulness of the purposes of the proposed \ncorporation and that he may, in the fulfillment of his duties, determine the \nquestion of law whether or not those purposes are lawful and embraced within \nthat class concerning which the law permits corporations to be formed, this does \nnot necessarily mean, as we have already intimated, that his duties are not \nministerial. On the contrary, there is no incompatibility in holding, as we do \nhold, that his duties are ministerial and that he has no authority to exercise \ndiscretion in receiving and registering articles of incorporation. He may \nexercise judgment\u2014that is, the judicial function\u2014in the determination of the \nquestion of law referred to, but he may not use discretion. The question whether \nor not the objects of a proposed corporation are lawful is one that can be \ndecided one way only. If he err in the determination of that question and refuse \nto file articles which should be filed under the law, that decision is subject \nto review and correction and, upon proper showing, he will be ordered to file \nthe articles. This is the same kind of determination which a court makes when it \ndecides a case upon the merits. When, a case is presented to a court upon the \nmerits, the court can decide only one way and be right. As a matter of law, \nthere is only one course to pursued. In a case where the court or other official \nhas discretion in the resolution of a question, then, within certain \nlimitations, he may decide the question either way and still be right. \nDiscretion, it may be said generally, is a faculty conferred upon a court or \nother official by which he may decide a question either way and still be right. \nThe power conferred upon the division of archives with respect to the \nregistration of articles of incorporation is not of that character. It is of the \nsame character as the determination of a lawsuit by a court upon the merits. It \ncan be decided only one way correctly.<\/p>\n<p>If, therefore, the defendant erred in determining the question presented when \nthe articles were offered for registration, then that error will be corrected by \nthis court in this action and he will be compelled to register the articles as \noffered. If, however, he did not commit an error, but decided that question \ncorrectly, then, of course, his action will be affirmed to the extent that we \nwill deny the relief prayed for.<\/p>\n<p>The next question leads us to the determination of whether or not the \npurposes of the corporation as stated in the articles of incorporation are \nlawful within the meaning of the Corporation Law.<\/p>\n<p>The purpose of the incorporation as stated in the articles is: \"That the \nobject of the corporation is (<em>a<\/em>) to organize and regulate the \nmanagement, disposition, administration and control which the barrio of Pulo or \nSan Miguel or its inhabitants or residents have over the common property of said \nresidents or inhabitants or property belonging to the whole barrio as such; and \n(<em>b<\/em>) to use the natural products of the said property for institutions, \nfoundations, and charitable works of common utility and advantage to the barrio \nor its inhabitants.\"<\/p>\n<p>The municipality of Pasig as recognized by law contains within its limits \nseveral barrios or small settlements, like Pulo or San Miguel, which have no \nlocal government of their own but are governed by the municipality of Pasig \nthrough its municipal president and council. The president and members of the \nmunicipal council are elected by a general vote of the municipality, the \nqualified electors of all the barrios having the right to participate.<\/p>\n<p>The municipality of Pasig is a municipal corporation organized by law. It has \nthe control of all property of the municipality. The various barrios of the \nmunicipality have no right to own or hold property, they not being recognized as \nlegal entities by any law. The residents of the barrios participate in the \nadvantages which accrue to the municipality from public property and receive all \nof the benefits incident to residence in a municipality organized by law. If \nthere is any public property situated in the barrio of Pulo or San Miguel not \nbelonging to the general government or the province, it belongs to the \nmunicipality of Pasig and the sole authority to manage and administer the same \nresides in that municipality. Until the present laws upon the subject are \nchanged no other entity can be the owner of such property or control or \nadminister it.<\/p>\n<p>The object of the proposed corporation, as appears from the articles offered \nfor registration, is to make of the barrio of Pulo or San Miguel a corporation \nwhich will become the owner of and have the right to control and administer any \nproperty belonging to the municipality of Pasig found within the limits of that \nbarrio. This clearly cannot be permitted. Otherwise municipalities as now \nestablished by law could be deprived of the property which they now own and \nadminister. Each barrio of the municipality would become, under the scheme \nproposed, a separate corporation, would take over the ownership, administration, \nand control of that portion of the municipal territory within its limits. This \nwould disrupt, in a sense, the municipalities of the Islands by dividing them \ninto a series of smaller municipalities entirely independent of the original \nmunicipality.<\/p>\n<p>What the law does not permit cannot be obtained by indirection. The object of \nthe proposed corporation is clearly repugnant to the provisions of the Municipal \nCode and the governments of municipalities as they have been organized \nthereunder.

The \ncontentions of counsel for defendants and appellants in this connection are \nsufficiently and satisfactorily disposed of in the opinion of this court in the \ncase of Aldamis <em>vs.<\/em> Leuterio (8 Phil. Rep., 688, 691), and the cases \nthere cited, Williams <em>vs.<\/em> Bruffy (96 U. S., 176); Stevens <em>vs.<\/em> \nGriffith (111 U. S., 48); Baldy<em> vs.<\/em> Hunter (171 U. S., 388). The \nprinciples announced in the former case are clearly applicable to the case at \nbar and decisive of it, so that, adhering to the doctrine therein announced, the \njudgment of the court below should be and is affirmed on this branch of the \ncase.<\/p>\n<p>We cannot, however, agree with the trial judge, in his finding that it was \nnecessary for the plaintiff to pay the sum of P2,850 Mexican currency to the \nCompa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos (referred to hereinafter as the company) in order to \nrecover possession of certain tobacco which was unlawfully and forcibly seized \nby the defendants and which thereafter came into the possession of that company. \nWe have no doubt that plaintiff did in fact pay over that amount to the company \nin order to secure possession of the tobacco, but we think it is very clear from \nall the evidence of record, that there was no legal necessity therefor. In other \nwords, upon the evidence as developed by the record in this case, the plaintiff \nwas entitled to recover and by the institution of the proper action might have \nrecovered his tobacco from the company without the necessity for making payment \ntherefor. Upon the plaintiffs own showing he was wrongfully and forcibly \ndispossessed of the tobacco which came into the possession ,of the company, and \nin the light of the facts as disclosed by this record he had a perfect right to \nrecover possession of his property from the company, without the payment of any \nindemnity whatever. It is not even suggested in the record that the payment of \nthis money was rendered necessary by the threatened or actual insolvency of the \ncompany or for any other reason whatever which could have justified the payment \nunder protest, in order to avoid loss and damage to an amount still greater than \nthat paid to the company.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge rendered judgment in favor of \nthe plaintiff and against the defendants for the amount thus paid to the \ncompany, and the judgment must therefore be reversed to that extent. It is \nadmitted that the plaintiff recovered Jill the tobacco which was unlawfully \nseized by the defendants, and the measure of his damages arising out of the \ntransaction, for which they could properly be held responsible in a civil \naction, is compensation for the wrongful detention, together with his necessary \nand reasonable expenditures incurred in his efforts to recover possession. (38 \nCyc, 2101, and cases there cited.) There is no evidence in the record as to loss \nor damage of this nature, except the evidence touching the payment to the \ncompany, and it appearing that there was no reasonable or legal necessity for \nthe payment of the amount in question in order to recover possession of the \ntobacco, we are of opinion that plaintiff is not entitled to reimbursement \ntherefor from these defendants. To hold otherwise would put it in the power of \nthe injured party in cases such as that at bar, to augment the damages suffered \nby him to any extent which malice or a willful disregard of the rights of the \noffender might dictate, and would open the door to fraud in all such cases. To \nallow the owner of property who has been wrongfully deprived of possession to \npile up expenses for the alleged purpose of recovering the property, which are \nnot reasonable and necessary to that end, and to recover as damages the amount \nof such expenditures, would in many instances work a greater wrong than that \noriginally committed. Such expenditures can in no proper sense be held to have \nbeen occasioned by the wrongful act of the trespasser, whose liability is \nlimited to the repair of the damage resulting from such wrongful act.<\/p>\n<p>Let judgment be entered affirming the judgment in all respects, except as to \nso much thereof as allows damages (<em>da\u00f1os y perjuicios<\/em>) in the sum of \nP2,850, and reversing so much thereof as allows the said damages, without \nspecial condemnation of costs in this instance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Moreland, Trent,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

ELISEO REYES, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARAULLO, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">Eliseo Reyes was charged, in the information presented for the purpose, with \nhaving, on or about the 10th day of October, 1913, in the city of Manila, \nabducted willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously and with unchaste designs, with \nher own consent, Apolonia Enriquez, a virgin 17 years of age. After a trial of \nthe case in all its proceedings, judgment was rendered by the Court of First \nInstance of this city, on December 6,1913, whereby the defendant was found \nguilty of the said crime and sentenced to the penalty of one year eight months \nand twenty-one days of <em>prision correccional,<\/em> to endow the offended \nparty in the sum of P250, to maintain the offspring, should there be any, to \nsuffer in case of insolvency the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and to \npay the costs. The defendant appealed from this judgment.\n<p>The sole question raised in this court by defendant's counsel, through the \nappeal submitted and by means of the assignments of error set forth in the two \nbriefs presented by him, is whether Apolonia Enriquez was seduced or induced by \nthe defendant to leave the house of her parents and join the defendant\u2014an \nindispensable requisite, as defendant's counsel himself correctly says, for the \nexistence of the crime of abduction with consent, provided for and punished by \narticle 446 of the Penal Code.<\/p>\n<p>The defense, in raising this question, admits the existence of the other two \nrequisites which must concur in order that the said crime may be held to have \nbeen committed, to wit, that the said girl was under 18 years of age and a \nvirgin when the crime under prosecution was committed. <\/p>\n<p>It was proven that Apolonia Enriquez left the house of her parents, with whom \nshe was living in Calle Singalong, on the morning of October 10, 1913, and went \nto another house on the same street; that the same day the defendant joined her \nand they afterwards went together to another house in Calle Sandejas, where they \nstayed several days; and that they then removed to another house in Calle \nAlvarez, Sampaloc, in which they remained five days, until the girl was found by \nher godfather, Nestorio Medel. It was also proved, by the explicit statements of \nthe defendant and of the girl herself, that during all the time they were living \ntogether in the houses above mentioned they repeatedly had carnal intercourse. \nThe evidence likewise discloses that for six months prior to October 10, 1913, \nthe defendant maintained amorous relations with Apolonia Enriquez, although he \nwas a married man\u2014a fact of which she was not aware\u2014 and that those relations \nwere so intimate and the girl's inclination toward the defendant was such that \nhe had complete control over her will, as clearly appears from the letters which \nthe defense endeavored at the trial to utilize in his behalf and which turned \nout to be the best and most convincing proof that the girl was subjugated and \ndominated by the passion which the defendant awakened in her and to such an \nextent that she left the house of her parents on the day aforementioned in \nobedience to an agreement previously made between them. In spite of the \ndefendant's denial, it is clearly concluded from one of the letters presented at \nthe trial by the defense that on the day preceding the abduction he had an \ninterview with the girl outside of her house, and what occurred the next day was \nnothing more than the result of that meeting.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, even admitting it to be true that the girl called up the \ndefendant by telephone from the house where she was in Singalong, as he \ntestified that she did, and informed him that she was now outside her house and \nwaiting for him there, this could not constitute proof that there had previously \nbeen no inducement or seduction on the part of the defendant to make her leave \nthe house of her parents on the morning referred to. But that fact does plainly \nshow that there was a previous agreement between them to go from there to \nanother house, as in fact they did, and consummate the act which constituted the \ncrime of abduction prosecuted in this case; and this is perfectly plain and \nobvious, for, if after the defendant had had that interview with the girl it had \nnot been his intention to take her away from her parents' home for the purpose \nof satisfying his carnal appetite upon her, but only to come, as he said, in \nanswer to her summons by telephone, he could have refrained from taking her with \nhim and living with her two days in one house and afterwards five days in \nanother distant from that of her parents, for it is situated in the district of \nSampaloc in an opposite part of the city from Malate, where Calle Singalong is, \nand he could have refrained, during all that time in both of these houses and \nbefore the girl had been found by her godmother's husband, Nestorio Medel, from \ncarrying out the unchaste designs which it is evident he entertained toward her, \nas it is also evident that his relations with the girl were for no other purpose \nfrom the beginning than to seduce her and deceive her in order to accomplish \nthose designs, inasmuch as, being a married man, he knew that he could not marry \nher.<\/p>\n<p>The defense, however, tried to prove by the document marked Exhibit 1,-that \nthe girl left the house of her parents voluntarily, through fear of being \nmaltreated by them, and was not taken away from her home by anybody; and also \nthat although she knew the defendant was married she went to live with him in \norder that he might take care of her. Even though it be considered to have been \nproved, as it is not sufficiently, that she did make the statements contained in \nthat document, since it is dated the 10th of October, the same day, as is seen, \nthat the defendant took possession of the person of the offended party and \nmaterially made her his own, when the girl, conquered by passion, could not \nrefuse to accede to any request bf his, evidently it can have no value for the \npurposes intended by the defense and only serves to prove that the defendant, \nconvinced of the responsibility he had incurred by his acts, endeavored thereby \nto see whether he might free himself therefrom, should he be prosecuted, as has \noccurred in this case. That document, moreover, in connection with the other \ntwo, Exhibits B and C, which were presented by the prosecution and bear date of \nthe following day, October 11, and in which the defendant himself declares that \nhe will be faithful to Apolonia Enriquez all the time that they shall live \ntogether and authorizes her, in case he fails to keep his promise or abandons \nher, to do with him whatever she may please or to prosecute him, shows that the \ndefendant, recognizing his fault, endeavored to avoid prosecution by the \noffended party or by her family, by making her believe, as she testified at the \ntrial that she did, that by presenting document Exhibit B in court he could get \nmarried to her, and by assuring Nestorio Medel, when this latter went to see him \nin order to find out the whereabouts of the offended party, that that document, \nwhich the girl had in her possession, was the certificate of his marriage to \nher. All these facts demonstrate that the defendant was deceiving the girl \nduring the whole time he had her in his company and until the last moment, by \nmaking her believe that he was not married\u2014an error which she perceived only \nwhen in the office of the prosecuting attorney of this city the accused was \nasked by the fiscal whether he wished to marry the girl and he replied that this \nwas impossible as he was married.<\/p>\n<p>As this Supreme Court has already held in the case of the United States vs. \nReyes (20 Phil. Rep., 510), in order that the crime of abduction, with the \nconsent of the abducted, which is punished by article 446 of the Penal Code, \nexist, it is not necessary that the abducted woman should have been materially \nremoved from the house of her parents or from that of persons charged with her \nkeeping or custody; it is sufficient that she should have left it and withdrawn \nherself from their' control and vigilance, yielding to the cajolery and promises \nof her seducer, because, according to the principle laid down by the supreme \ncourt of Spain in its decision of November 30, 1875, the law provides \npunishment, in respect to this crime, not for the violence done, to the person \nabducted, since it is assumed that she gave her consent, but for the disgrace to \nher family and the alarm caused therein by the disappearance of one of its \nmembers who, from her age and sex, is susceptible to cajolery and deceit. The \nplace where the abduction is committed is immaterial, for the law takes no \naccount of it. The same principle is laid down in the decisions of the same \ncourt, of October 29, 1895, and March 31, 1896.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant did not, in fact, materially remove Apolonia Enriquez, a maiden \n17 years of age, from the house of her parents, but he did induce her to leave \nit. In spite of his being married, he maintained amorous relations with her for \nsix months prior to the 10th of October, 1913, gaining her consent during all \nthat time and seducing her; and after the girl by agreement with him had left \nthe paternal roof on the day aforementioned and withdrawn herself from her \nparents\u2019 control and vigilance, he took her away with him and derived carnal \nenjoyment from her during the time that he had her in his company. Those facts \nevidently constitute the crime of abduction, provided for and punished by the \nsaid article 446 of the Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 2298 of the Philippine \nLegislature, and, the defendant being criminally liable for the said crime, as \nthe principal thereof by direct participation, its commission being unattended \nby any circumstance that mitigates his responsibility, the penalty specified in \nthe said article should be imposed upon Mm in the medium degree, as was done in \nthe judgment appealed from, together with that of civil liability and the others \nmentioned in the said judgment, which is in accordance with the law, though the \ndefendant should also have been sentenced to suspension of the right to hold \npublic office and the right of suffrage during the term of the sentence, which \npenalties are accessory to the principal one imposed, as provided by article 61 \nof the Penal Code.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, with this addition, we affirm the judgment appealed from, with the \ncosts against the appellant. <\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

To procure the liberty of the accused pending trial, \nA. A. Addison and Pastor M. Gomez became his sureties upon a bail bond, the \nimportant parts of which are the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Whereas a complaint has been filed on the 10th of June, 1912, in the court \nof the justice of the peace of Vigan, Ilocos Sur, P. I., charging Walter Schultz \nwith the offense of 'malversation of public funds by a public official,' and he \nhaving been admitted to bail in the sum of two thousand pesos (P2,000) \nPhilippine currency:<\/p>\n<p>\"Now, therefore, we, Pastor Gomez, of Calle Sacristia No. 954, and A. A. \nAddison, of Calle Globo de Oro, No. 70, jointly and severally, hereby undertake \nthat the above-named Walter Schultz will appear and answer the charge above \nmentioned in whatever court it may be tried, and will at all times hold himself \namenable to the orders and process of the court, and if convicted will appear \nfor judgment and render himself to the execution thereof; or if he fails to \nperform any of these conditions that we will pay to the United States the sum of \ntwo thousand pesos (P2,000) Philippine currency.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The accused having renounced his right to a preliminary investigation before \nthe justice of the peace, the case, being one over which the latter had no \njurisdiction, was sent to the Court of First Instance for further proceedings. \nOn the 7th of October, 1912, the Court of First Instance received a petition \nsigned by A. A. Addison and Pastor M. Gomez, in which, after alleging that they \ndesired to deliver the accused into the custody of the law and to relieve \nthemselves from the obligation imposed by the bond, they prayed that said court \nissue an order of arrest against said accused for the purpose of his \napprehension. The ground upon which they based this application was that the \naccused had absented himself from the city of Manila, where he had been for some \ntime, and that the bondsmen were unable to ascertain his whereabouts, although \nthey had made diligent search. On the 8th of October the court denied the \npetition. On the 22d of November the bondsmen again applied to the court for the \nissuance of an order of arrest against the accused, basing their application \nupon the same ground as before. In this application they alleged that the \naccused could not be found, although the Information Division of the Bureau of \nConstabulary had made diligent search for him. On the 30th of November the court \nagain denied the application.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"At a session of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur held on the 30th \nof November, 1912, the trial of the case was set for the 26th of December of the \nsame year. At the opening of the court on said 30th of November the bondsmen \napplied to the court for a reconsideration of its previous orders denying the \napplication of the bondsmen to be relieved from their responsibility and for an \norder of arrest against the accused, and again prayed that the court issue such \norder of arrest, alleging as a ground therefor that the peace authorities did \nnot believe that they were authorized to arrest the accused without such order. \nThey further prayed that on the issuance of said order of arrest the bond which \nthey had signed be canceled and that they be relieved from all responsibility \nthereunder.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On the 10th of December the court, acting on the petition of the bondsmen \nabove referred to, ordered the clerk to issue to said bondsmen.a certified copy \nof the bail bond, with an order authorizing said bondsmen to arrest their \nprincipal or require his arrest by any policeman or peace officer, but refused \nto relieve the bondsmen from their obligation under the bond. This order was \nmailed to the bondsmen on the same day that it was issued.<\/p>\n<p><br\/>On the 31st of March, 1913, the prosecuting attorney of Ilocos Sur moved \nthe court that the said bondsmen be ordered to present the body of the accused \nto the court on the 10th day of April, 1913, for trial, with the admonition that \nif they failed or neglected to do so, the bond would be declared forfeited. This \norder was served on the sureties on the 7th of April. The accused was not served \nwith a copy for the reason that he could not be found within the Philippine \nIslands.<\/p>\n<p>The cause was called for trial on the 10th of April, 1913, and the body of \nthe accused not having been presented, the judge declared the bond forfeited. \nThe order of forfeiture gave the sureties thirty days within which to present \nthe body of the accused and admonished them that if they did not do so within \nthat time or show cause satisfactory to the court why they did not, judgment \nwould be rendered and entered against them for the amount of the obligation. \n<\/p>\n<p>On the 5th of May, 1913, the bondsmen filed their answer, alleging that they \ndid not appear in Vigan before the Court of First Instance on the 10th of April, \nas ordered, for the reason that they did not have time to reach that place from \nManila after they received notice of the order, and that the reason why they \nwere unable to deliver the body of the accused was that the court had refused to \nissue the order of arrest which they had three times prayed for, and praying \nthat upon the allegations made they be relieved of responsibility.<\/p>\n<p>On the 28th of July, 1913, the prosecuting attorney of Ilocos Sur moved the \ncourt that judgment be entered against Pastor M. Gomez and A, A. Addison, \nsureties for Walter Schultz, for the sum of $\"2,000, and that the judgment be \nexecuted at once. This motion was notified to the bondsmen and their counsel and \nhearing of the same was set for the 3d of September at 8 o'clock in the morning. \nOn the 19th of August G. E. Campbell, attorney for the bondsmen and for the \naccused, asked for a postponement of the hearing of the motion until the 3d of \nNovember. The hearing was finally set for the 26th of December. The bondsmen or \nthe accused not having appeared at the time set, the 26th of December, the court \nfound in their favor, absolving them from all responsibility under the bond.<\/p>\n<p>It is against that judgment that this appeal is taken. <\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the judgment must be reversed.<\/p>\n<p>Section 75 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The sureties of the bail bond may surrender the defendant at any time prior \nto forfeiture, or he may surrender himself and the bail be thus exonerated. An \norder of exoneration may be made by the court upon proof of surrender and after \ndue notice to the promoter fiscal of the proposed issuance of the order. For the \npurpose of surrendering the defendant the bail may arrest him, or on written \nauthority indorsed on a certified copy of the undertaking may cause him to be \narrested by any police officer or any other person of suitable age and \ndiscretion.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As stated by the attorney for the appellees:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"From the wording of this section it is clear that there are two methods that \nmay be pursued by the bail in order to surrender the accused, * * * they may \narrest him themselves or they may cause his arrest through certain \nchannels.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In order words, the bail may arrest the principal and deliver him to the \nproper authorities, or they may cause his arrest to be made by any police \nofficer or other person of suitable age and discretion by indorsing the \nauthority to arrest upon a certified copy of the undertaking and delivering it \nto such officer or person. These are the only methods, in a general way, by \nwhich the sureties may relieve themselves from responsibility relative to the \nrecognizance.<\/p>\n<p>The bondsmen did not do either of these things. Instead of delivering the \nprincipal to the court having jurisdiction over him or to the sheriff thereof or \nhis deputy, or of procuring his arrest by a peace officer authorized by \nindorsement upon a certified copy of the undertaking, they permitted the accused \nto escape and then sought to induce the court in which the action against the \nprincipal was pending to issue an order of arrest that the principal might be \napprehended and they absolved. The court to which the application was presented \ndid not consider itself authorized under the showing made to issue the order \nprayed for. Its position evidently was that the principal was at liberty under a \nbond which had not been revoked or withdrawn in the manner prescribed by law; \nand that, until the moment of cancellation or revocation of the bail bond in \npursuance of law, the accused was entitled to his liberty. The court, therefore, \nrefused to issue the order of arrest. We do not regard this position as \naltogether tenable. While the contention of the sureties, in their application \nfor the order of arrest, that they be relieved from obligation when the order \nwas issued, cannot be sustained, the Court of First Instance, under the facts \npresented, should have lent the sureties, in such manner as the law permits, all \nthe aid that it reasonably could in the apprehension of the principal. While the \nCode of Criminal Procedure sets out the methods by which the sureties may \nrelease themselves from their obligation, it does not say that the court may not \nassist them to release themselves; and we think that the court in this case \nshould have assisted them in their endeavor to apprehend and deliver the \nprincipal and thereby to relieve themselves from responsibility. We have no \ndoubt about the power of the court, with or without the application of the \nsureties, to order the arrest of a principal if it is shown or appears that he \nis attempting or planning his escape or is in hiding for the purpose of \ndefeating the ends of justice.<\/p>\n<p>We do not now decide to what court or other official it is necessary for \nsureties to present their principal in order to be relieved from responsibility \nunder the bond. That question is not before us. The sureties never delivered or \nattempted to deliver the body of their principal to any court or peace officer. \nThey simply asked the cooperation of certain peace officials for the capture of \nthe principal whose whereabouts was, at the time, admittedly unknown. <\/p>\n<p>When the obligation of bail is assumed, the sureties become in law the \njailers of their principal. Their custody of him is the continuance of the \noriginal imprisonment, and though they cannot actually confine him, they are \nsubrogated to all the other rights and means which the Government possesses to \nmake their control of him effective. The responsibility assumed by the bail, \nbeing purely gratuitous, may be terminated by them at any time, and, to effect \nthis end, they may arrest the principal at pleasure and surrender him into the \nhands of the law. Even though there were no statute to that effect, the right of \nthe bail to arrest the principal for the purpose of surrendering him is \nincidental to the engagement, and the issuing of process is not necessary to its \nexercise. The arrest may be made by the bail, either in person or by agent, in \nthe manner prescribed by statute. They may pursue him; may seize him at any time \nof the day or night, and may enter his house for that purpose. If resistance be \napprehended, they may at all times command the assistance of the peace officers \nupon complying with the terms of the statute. (Reese <em>vs.<\/em> U. S., 9 \nWall., 13; U. S. <em>vs. <\/em>Ryder, 110 U. S., 729; State <em>vs.<\/em> \nLingerfelt, 109 N. C., 775; Taylor <em>vs.<\/em> Taintor, 16 Wall., 366; Bearden \n<em>vs.<\/em> State, 89 Ala., 21; Norfolk<em> vs.<\/em> People, 43 111., 9; \nKellogg <em>vs.<\/em> State, 43 Miss., 57; Hughes <em>vs.<\/em> State, 28 Tex. \nApp., 499; State <em>vs.<\/em> Rosseau, 39 Tex., 614; State <em>vs.<\/em> \nCunningham, 10 La.

Rep., 422; Read \n<em>vs.<\/em> Case, 4 Conn., 166; Sternberg <em>vs.<\/em> State, 42 Ark., \n127.)<\/p>\n<p>To the sureties the state gives every facility for the apprehension and \nsurrender of the principal and there is, therefore, very little excuse for their \nfailure to protect themselves. While we do not determine whether or not a peace \nofficer has the right to arrest the principal on the request of the sureties if \nthey do not present a certified copy of the bond properly indorsed, there is no \nevidence that any peace officer had an opportunity to arrest the principal after \nhaving received notice to do so from the sureties, or that the refusal of such \nan officer, if any, had any influence on the result. Nor do we hold, either, \nthat a court may not issue an order of arrest for the accused upon the \nrepresentation of the bondsmen upon the proper showing. We simply say that, upon \nthe facts before us, we are not prepared to hold that the Court of First \nInstance of Ilocos Sur erred in refusing to issue the order of arrest under the \nshowing made\u2014at least no error was made sufficient to relieve the sureties. It \ndoes riot appear from the record that the action of the court had any effect on \nthe outcome as it is fairly clear that the sureties permitted the principal to \nescape before any attempt was made to apprehend him.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment absolving the sureties is reversed and the case is remanded to \nthe Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur, with instructions to enter judgment \nagainst the sureties in accordance with this opinion.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

MARIANO CUI, AS JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF THE PROVINCE OF TAYABAS, AND BALDOMERO CALATRAVA, RESPONDENTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">In this proceeding it is prayed that a writ of mandamus issue directing the \nrespondent Mariano Cui, as judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province \nof Tayabas, to approve a proposed bill of exceptions in civil case No. 600 of \nthat court, and thereby allow an appeal to the Supreme Court for a review of the \njudgment, orders, and decrees of the court in that action.\n<p>The complaint also prays, that this court, if it find an appeal from the \njudgment, orders, and decrees aforesaid will, not lie, issue a writ of \ncertiorari, directed to the judge aforesaid to certify to this court a complete \ntranscript of the record of the court in the cause, so that the acts of the \ncourt may be reviewed and their legality determined as provided by law; and that \nthe orders and decrees specified therein be declared null and void as having \nbeen made without or in excess of jurisdiction.<\/p>\n<p>It appears undisputed that on the 10th of January, 1911, Baldomero Calatrava \nbegan an action against the plaintiffs in this case for the summary possession \nof real estate in the justice's court of Sariaya, Tayabas, of which lands, it \nwas alleged, defendants in that case had deprived the plaintiff by one of the \nmeans described in section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The action was \ntried and decision rendered by the justice's court in favor of the plaintiff and \npossession of the lands was duly awarded. The defendants appealed to the Court \nof First Instance.<\/p>\n<p>After the perfection of the appeal the plaintiff Calatrava reproduced in the \nCourt of First Instance the complaint which he had filed in the justice's court, \nwhich, after having been amended in some particulars unimportant here, was \nreceived by that court as the complaint in the case.<\/p>\n<p>On the 16th day of October, 1911, Calatrava, the plaintiff, was notified by \nthe clerk of the court that the case had been put on the calendar for trial on \nthe 2d day of November, 1911. There appears in the record a certificate of such \nservice signed by the clerk in the following form:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This 16th day of October, 1911, notices were sent by mail to Baldomero \nCalatrava and Rosendo Palad at Sariaya, notifying them that the present case was \nset down on the calendar of the court for the 2d day of November, \n1911.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On the 28th day of October, 1911, the defendants filed a demurrer to the \ncomplaint. It does not appear that a copy of this demurrer was served upon the \nattorney for the plaintiff or upon the plaintiff himself.<\/p>\n<p>On the 2d of November the case was duly called for a hearing upon the \ndemurrer and the latter having been considered by the court was sustained and \nthe complaint dismissed. On the same day notice of the decision was sent by the \nclerk of the court to the plaintiff, Calatrava, service of which is certified by \nthe clerk by the following added to the bottom of the order sustaining the \ndemurrer and dismissing the complaint:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This 2d day of November, 1911, a copy of the foregoing order was sent to \nplaintiff at Sariaya.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On the 30th of November, 1912, more than one year after the rendition of the \njudgment and notice of the same as aforesaid, said Court of First Instance, but \nwith a different judge presiding, set aside the order sustaining the demurrer \nand dismissing the complaint and reinstated the cause, basing its action upon \nthe ground that the order sustaining the demurrer had been made and the cause \ndismissed without notice to the plaintiff. This order of the court seems to have \nbeen notified to both parties in the case, for, later, we see the defendants in \npursuance thereof answering the complaint without objection and proceeding with \nthe preparation of the cause for trial. Issue was later duly joined and the \ncause tried, the court rendering judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against \nthe defendants.<\/p>\n<p>Portions of the judgment of the court material to the questions before us are \nas follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The court finds and decides that the plaintiff is the sole owner and \nlegitimate possessor of the lands in question, with a perfect right to the \npossession of the same and that the defendants have been unjustly detaining the \nsaid lands since the 3d day of January, 1911.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">* * * * * * *<\/p>\n<p>\"That the defendants, their agents and servants, are for ever prohibited from \ninterfering in any manner whatever with the plaintiff in the possession of said \nlands.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p align=\"center\">* * * * * * *<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The right is reserved to the plaintiff of bringing an action against the \ndefendants for the recovery of the value of the product of said lands and \ndamages resulting from the detention thereof.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We are of the opinion that mandamus will not lie. The action in the justice's \ncourt was one merely for the summary recovery of the possession of land and had \nnothing to do directly with the determination of the ownership thereof<\/p>\n<p>The case was appealed to the Court of First Instance and was tried upon the \nsame theory. It has been held by this court, the writer of this opinion \ndissenting, that a third instance, that is, an appeal to the Supreme Court, does \nnot lie in summary proceedings.<\/p>\n<p>That being1 so, no appeal lies in this case from the judgment of the Court of \nFirst Instance, and, accordingly, the petition for the writ ordering that an \nappeal be allowed must be denied.<\/p>\n<p>We are also of the opinion that the petitioners are not entitled to the writ \nof certiorari as prayed for. We regard the action of the Court of First Instance \nvacating the order sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the action as within \nits jurisdiction. If the notice of the hearing of the cause on the 2d of \nNovember, 1911, had been given as required by law our judgment would have been \ndifferent. In such case the order would have become final long before the order \nvacating it was made and the court would have been without jurisdiction in the \npremises upon the showing made.<\/p>\n<p>As will be observed, however, the notice was given by the clerk to the \nplaintiff in the case and not to his attorney.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff had appeared in the justice's court by E. A. Gala, an attorney \nand counselor at law of Lucena, Tayabas, and had also appeared in the Court of \nFirst Instance on appeal by the same attorney, who signed the complaint. It is \nthe general rule that where a party appears by attorney in an action or \nproceeding in a court of record, all notices thereafter required to be given in \nthe action or proceeding must be given to the attorney and not the client; and \nthat a notice given to the client and not to his attorney is not a notice in \nlaw. (Rules 3 and 12, Courts of First Instance.) As a necessary consequence, the \ndemurrer was sustained and the action was dismissed without legal notice to the \nparty interested. This being the case, the plaintiff could apply within a \nreasonable time after discovering the dismissal of his action for the vacation \nof the dismissing order and the reinstatement of the cause. This was in fact \ndone soon after the discovery, and we are of the opinion that the court had \njurisdiction to make the order which it made.<\/p>\n<p>There appear to be, however, certain references in the judgment of the court \nwhich seem to decide the question of ownership and which seem also to have been \nmade upon the theory that the ownership of the property in question was \nnecessarily determined by that judgment. We have already quoted those parts of \nthe decision which seem to do this. In so far as they in any way affect the \ntitle to the land in question, they are beyond the jurisdiction of the court to \nmake and must be held to be void.<\/p>\n<p>It is a principle established by decisions of this court that, on an appeal \nIn summary proceedings, the Court of First Instance has no wider jurisdiction or \ngreater powers than had the justice's court from which the appeal was taken. A \njustice of the peace having in summary proceedings no jurisdiction to determine \nthe title to land, the Court of First Instance has no such power on an \nappeal.<\/p>\n<p>The petition for mandamus is, therefore, denied, as is also the petition for \na writ of certiorari except as herein above stated, with costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.
