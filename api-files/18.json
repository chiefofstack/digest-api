VICENTE REYES AND JUAN ORDOVEZA, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal from a judgment sustaining a demurrer to the complaint on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.<br\/><br\/>On July 29, 1902, Rivera sold a parcel of land to Reyes and Ordoveza for 800 pesos under <i>pacto de recto<\/i>, on the condition, however, that the repurchase could not be made until after three years from the date of the contract of sale.\u00a0 In this document Rivera states that he was of age.\u00a0 On May 29, 1903, Rivera sold his right to repurchase to Rosales for 1,075 pesos.\u00a0 In the document evidencing this sale, Rivera states that he is 23 years of age.\u00a0 Rosales, who is the plaintiff in this\u00a0 case, alleges that in January, 1908, he tendered 800 pesos to Reyes and Ordoveza with the request that the land be surrendered to him in accordance with the contract entered into between them and Rivera in 1902, but that they refused to accept the money and comply with his request.<br\/><br\/>1. The first objection to the complaint is that it is inconsistent because plaintiff asks that the contract in question be annulled on the ground that Rivera was a minor when he entered into it in 1902, and then asks that the defendants be required to deliver the land to him upon payment to them of 800 pesos, as per its terms.\u00a0 There is no basis for this objection for the reason that the inconsistency alleged appears in the prayer for relief.\u00a0 As stated in 1 Sutherland on Code Pleading (sec. 186) :<br\/><blockquote>\"The demand in the complaint is no part of the statement of the cause of action, and does not give it character.\u00a0 The facts alleged do this, and the plaintiff is entitled to as much relief as they warrant.\"<\/blockquote>See also Philips on Code Pleading (sec. 205), where it is said:\u00a0 \"The prayer for relief, though part of the complaint, is no part of the cause of action.\u00a0 A single right of action may entitle the\u00a0 plaintiff to several kinds of relief, and several rights of action may authorize but a single relief.\"<br\/><br\/>The contract of 1902 cannot be annuled, however, for the reason that Rivera ratified it by entering into the contract with Rosales in 1903, wherein he stated he was 23 years of age, thus making applicable the provisions of article 1311 (Civil Code), which provides:\u00a0 \"It shall be understood that there is an implied confirmation when, being aware of the cause of the nullity and such cause having ceased to exist, the person who may have a right to invoke should execute an act which necessarily implies his wish to renounce such a right.\"<br\/><br\/>2. The next objection to the complaint is that the right to repurchase had expired before Rosales attempted to exercise it.\u00a0 This is based upon the first paragraph of article 1508 of the Civil Code, which reads:\u00a0 \"The right (to repurchase)\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 in the absence of an express agreement, shall last four years counted from the date of the contract.\"<br\/><br\/>The contract of 1902 provided that the right to repurchase could not be exercised within three years from the date of the contract.<br\/><br\/>The second paragraph of article 1508 reads:\u00a0 \"Should there be an agreement, the period shall not exceed ten years.\"<br\/><br\/>Under the <i>Partidas<\/i>, as under the Roman Law, no attempt was made to limit the duration of contracts with <i>pacto de retro<\/i>.\u00a0 Unless limited by the contract of the parties,\u00a0 it was generally held that the right to repurchase was perpetual.\u00a0 By its decision of May 12, 1875, the supreme court of Spain first attempted to place a restriction upon the length of such contracts by holding that they gave rise to a personal action of prescription in accordance with the law on prescription of actions.\u00a0 (23 Scaevola, 767.)\u00a0 In recent times, however, practically all those countries where such sales are recognized have found it advisable to limit the time within which the right of redemption can be exercised.\u00a0 (4 Bonel's Com. on the Civil Code, 519.)\u00a0 As stated in Yadao <i>vs<\/i>. Yadao (20\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 260) :\u00a0 \"A <i>pacto de retro<\/i> is, in a certain aspect, the suspension of the title to the land involved.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that it was the intention of the legislature to limit the continuance of such a condition, with the purpose that the title to the real estate in question should\u00a0 be definitely placed, it being, in the opinion of the legislature, against public policy to permit such an uncertain condition relative to the title to real estate to continue for more than ten years.\"<br\/><br\/>It might be added that there are many characteristics of these sales with <i>pacto de retro<\/i> which stamp them as being in the nature of usurious\u00a0 loans.\u00a0 The property is usually sold for a much smaller sum than it is actually worth, as witness the present case, where Rivera sold the property to the defendants for eight hundred pesos, and then sold his right to repurchase for a considerably larger amount.\u00a0 During the time the right to repurchase lasts the purchaser either takes\u00a0 possession of the property and receives the fruits thereof, or the vendor becomes his tenant and pays him rent for the use of the property.\u00a0 The chief inducement for purchasing property under such conditions is either the hope that the vendor will not be able to raise the amount of the redemption price within the time allowed, or else the prospect of enjoying the products of a property acquired at less than its market value.\u00a0 Doubtful conditions in such a contract should not therefore be construed too harshly against the vendor.<br\/><br\/>A stipulation in the contract providing that the right to repurchase is suspended for a certain time is undoubtedly a benefit to both the vendor and the purchaser.\u00a0 To the latter it affords a basis upon which he may plan his management and use of the property with some accuracy during the time it is in his possession, as he is in no danger of being suddenly ousted by the vendor's confronting him with the redemption price and demanding the surrender of the property.\u00a0 And for the security\u00a0 thus afforded to the purchaser in the enjoyment of the property he will be more inclined to pay a greater sum for it than he would in the absence of such a provision, thereby benefiting the vendor.<br\/><br\/>In the present case, the only stipulation of the parties with reference to the right to repurchase was that it could not be exercised within three years from the date of the sale.\u00a0 Had it not been for this condition, it is evident that that right would have expired four years from the date of the sale.\u00a0 But if it were held that, regardless of such a provision, the redemption right expires within four years from the date of the contract unless there is a special provision as to how long this right, once effective, shall continue, many otherwise perfectly valid contracts can be conceived in which the redemption privilege would be unenforceable; For instance, if the stipulation in question had provided that the right to redeem could not be exercised within five years from the date of the contract, it is quite apparent that, according to the argument advanced by the defendants, the vendor could not have redeemed the property at all, for the right to do so would have expired one year previously.<br\/><br\/>In such a case the question arises, Upon what basis must the duration of the right to repurchase be calculated?\u00a0 Any such contract must necessarily be terminated ten years from the date of its execution, but should the vendor have the privilege to exercise this right for the balance of the ten years, or should he be allowed only four years on the ground that there was no express agreement of the parties upon this point?\u00a0 In all such cases it would seem that the vendor should be allowed four years from the expiration of the time within which the right to redeem could not be exercised, or in the event that four years would extend the life of the contract beyond ten years, the balance of the ten-year period, on the ground that vendors, where the right to redeem is not thus suspended and no express agreement as to the length of time during which it may be exercised is made, are also allowed four years.\u00a0 This construction, it must be conceded, is the most logical and just.<br\/><blockquote>\"When a statute or instrument is equally susceptible of two interpretations, one in favor of natural right and the other against it, the former is to be adopted.\"\u00a0 (Sec. 294, Code Civ. Proc.)<\/blockquote>The provisions of article 1508 are strictly analogous to the statute of limitations upon actions.\u00a0 As the\u00a0 date on which a right of action expires is determined by the date it accrues and not by some prior event which might be considered as its inchoate beginning, so the right to repurchase is to be calculated from the day upon which that right may be freely exercised by the vendor, subject, of course, to the ten-year limitation of the law.\u00a0 Manresa (vol. 10, p. 303) touches upon this question:<br\/><blockquote>\"The starting point for calculating it (the redemption period) we understand is always the date of the contract, since, although the Code only so states in the first of the two said cases, in the second it is expressly prohibited that the period shall exist more than ten years, and it is clear that it would last longer if it were agreed, for example, that it would not begin to run until a certain time had elapsed after the date of the contract.\u00a0 This agreement, in so far as it might imply an extension of ten years, we believe would be null as being contrary to the manifest spirit of the law.\"<\/blockquote>We are of the opinion that the effect of the express stipulation or agreement in the contract which we have been discussing was to extend the life of the contract to seven years from the date of its execution.<br\/><br\/>3. The next point raised is that the complaint is defective in that it does not allege that the redemption price was judicially deposited upon the refusal of the defendants to surrender the property.\u00a0 In support of this contention counsel for the defendants rely upon the case of Angao <i>vs<\/i>. Clavano (17 Phil. Rep., 152); 10 Manresa 337, 338; and a decision of the supreme court of Spain of October 16, 1906, cited by Manresa.<br\/><br\/>Manresa and the supreme court of Spain in its decision of October 16, 1906, rely chiefly upon the second paragraph of article 1618 of the Spanish Code of Civil Procedure, wherein it is provided that in order to perfect a right of action for the recovery of things sold with the right of redemption, the redemption price must be deposited or, in the event that the price cannot be ascertained, a bond for its payment be executed.\u00a0 This is a matter of procedure only, and the provisions of that code are no longer in effect in this country.<br\/><br\/>An analogy might be drawn from the provisions of section 465 of Act No. 190, which reads:\u00a0 \"The judgment debtor, or redemptioner, may redeem the property from the purchaser, at any time within\u00a0 twelve\u00a0 months after the sale, on paying to the purchaser the amount of his purchase,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<br\/><br\/>This language is fully as strong as the language of article 1518 of the Civil Code, which provides that the \"vendor cannot exercise the right of redemption without returning to the vendee the price of the sale.\"\u00a0 Neither section 465 nor article 1518 makes any provision for cases where the possessor of the property refuses to accept the redemption price and surrender the property.\u00a0 This court, in Brusas <i>vs<\/i>. Infante (13 Phil. Rep., 217), where a judgment debtor sought to redeem property sold under execution and the purchaser refused to accept the price paid for it and surrender the property, held that the offer having been proven, it was not necessary for the judgment debtor to deposit the redemption price.<br\/><br\/>Again, in the Chattel Mortgage Law, Act No. 1508, a chattel mortgage is defined as a conditional sale, \"the condition being that the sale shall be void upon the seller paying to the purchaser a sum of money or doing some other act named.\u00a0 If the condition is performed according to its terms, the mortgage and sale immediately become void and the mortgagee is thereby divested of his\u00a0 title.\"\u00a0 (Sec. 3.)<br\/><br\/>Section 8 provides:\u00a0 \"If the mortgagee\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 after performance of the condition before or after\u00a0 the breach thereof, or after <i>tender<\/i> of the performance of the condition\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<br\/><br\/>A chattel mortgage, it will be observed, is in many respects similar to a sale under <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, and under section 8 of the Chattel Mortgage Law, a tender of performance is sufficient.<br\/><br\/>But the settled rule in this jurisdiction upon the precise question involved in this case is that an offer of the money, where the sum required is fixed and certain, is sufficient, and that it is unnecessary to deposit it.<br\/><br\/>In Lafont <i>vs<\/i>. Pascasio (5 Phil. Rep., 391), the right to repurchase expired on April 30, On April 25 the vendor caused a notary public to deliver a letter to his vendee requesting that she deliver the original document of sale to the notary in order that he might draw up the\u00a0 contract of repurchase.\u00a0 This she refused to do, and the next day the vendor sent her another letter by the same notary, advising her that the latter had in his possession the necessary money to redeem the property, and requesting that she accept the same and execute the proper contract of repurchase.\u00a0 This proposition was also refused, and on April 30, the vendor deposited the amount of the redemption price with the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 This court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The question remains whether the plaintiff did all that he was required by law to do in order to preserve the right secured to him by the contract.<br\/><br\/>*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"In regard to the payment of the money, the plaintiff did all that the law required him to do.\u00a0 He offered to pay it to the defendant and deposited it in the hands of a notary for her.<br\/><br\/>\"It is not necessary to decide the question as to whether the six months mentioned in the contract expired on the 30th day of April as claimed by the plaintiff or on the 28th day of April as claimed by the defendant, for the plaintiff, on the 25th and 26th of April, did all that the law required him to do to preserve his right to repurchase the property.\"<\/blockquote>In Villegas <i>vs<\/i>. Capistrano (9 Phil. Rep., 416), the right to repurchase expired on May 13.\u00a0 The vendor, on that date, sent an agent to the residence of the vendee with the necessary money, who found only his wife at home.\u00a0 She told him that she had no authority to act for her husband, but that she would inform him on his return of what had taken place.\u00a0 The money was offered to the defendant himself on May 15, but was refused on the ground that the agent had no authority to act for the vendor.\u00a0 Between this time and June 25 various attempts were made to pay the money but without avail, and on the latter day the agent deposited the redemption price with the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 The court, after quoting extensively from Lafont <i>vs<\/i>. Pascasio, <i>supra<\/i>, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"That case is decisive of this.\u00a0 When the plaintiff, on the 13th of May, by his duly authorized agent, presented himself at the residence of the defendant and offered to deliver the money, he did all that the law required him to do to preserve his rights to repurchase.\u00a0 The subsequent deposit of the amount with the clerk of the court was simply additional security for the defendant, but was not a necessary act to be performed by the plaintiff.\"<\/blockquote>In Fructo <i>vs<\/i>. Fuentes (15 Phil. Rep., 362), the right to repurchase expired on September 16.\u00a0 On that day an agent of the vendor called at the vendee's residence and remained there all day\u00a0 awaiting the latter, who was not at home.\u00a0 The agent offered the money to the vendee's wife, but she refused to accept it, telling him to await her husband's return.\u00a0 On the following day, the agent again called at the vendee's residence but could not find him at home.\u00a0 On the following day the agent was successful in finding the vendee at home, but the latter refused to recognize him as an agent of the vendor and declined to accept the money.\u00a0 On the 20th of September the vendor personally offered his vendee the redemption price, but the latter refused to accept it.\u00a0 In disposing of this case it was said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Under these findings of fact it is clearly shown that the plaintiff, not only on the day when the contract fell due made an effort to pay the amount due for the purpose of repurchasing the land in question, but on several consecutive days was this effort made.\u00a0 Without intending to hold that the vendor of land under a <i>pacto de retro<\/i> does not lose his right to repurchase the same on the day of the maturity of the contract, yet where, as in the present case, at the time of the maturity of the contract, he makes a diligent effort to repurchase, as was done in the present case, and fails by reason of circumstances over which he has no control, we are of the opinion and so hold that he does not lose his right to repurchase his land, by reason of his failure to repurchase on the day of maturity.\"<\/blockquote>In Retes <i>vs<\/i>. Suelto (20 Phil. Rep., 394), the above three cases were cited and affirmed upon the following state of facts.\u00a0 The right to redeem expired on March 16, and on February 24 the vendor tendered the amount due, but the vendee refused to accept it.\u00a0 On March 5 the vendor cited his vendee to appear before a justice of the peace and made a judicial offer to pay the amount of the redemption price, which the purchaser again refused to accept.\u00a0 The money was then deposited to the credit of the purchaser with the municipal president.\u00a0 This court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"From the record it appears that the plaintiff had done all that he was required to do for the purpose of securing the return of the possession of the land in question and was entitled to the possession of the same from and after the date on which he made a legal offer to pay the amount of the indebtedness due the defendant.\u00a0 (Lafont <i>vs<\/i>. Pascasio, 5 Phil. Rep., 391.)\u00a0 When a person having the right under a contract of <i>pacto de retro<\/i> makes a bona fide offer to repurchase, in accordance with the agreement and tenders the necessary amount of money, he has done all the law requires of him to preserve his right and to entitle him to the possession of the property.\u00a0 (Villegas <i>vs<\/i>. Capistrano, 9 Phil. Rep., 416; Fructo <i>vs<\/i>. Fuentes, 15 Phil. Rep., 362.)\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Angao <i>vs<\/i>. Clavano (17 Phil. Rep., 152), the facts were these:\u00a0 Plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant on September 25, 1900, whereby a parcel of land owned by him was sold to Clavano with the right to repurchase, to be exercised within one year after the marriage of the vendor.\u00a0 The vendor married on September 8, 1903, and did not offer to repurchase the property until August, 1906.\u00a0 In this case no motion was made for a new trial under section 497 of the Code of Civil Procedure, so the findings of fact were not before this court.\u00a0 It was said:<br\/><br\/>\"On September 9, 1904, the year immediately following the date of defendant's marriage had already fully elapsed and, up to the 8th of September of the said year, that being the last day of the year following his marriage, he had not yet repurchased the property, therefore, from the said date, September 9, defendant's right had already lapsed, for the year had passed and this last date arrived without his having repurchased the land.\"<br\/><br\/>The further remarks of the court to the effect that if the vendee refuses to accept the amount of the price when offered it must be placed on deposit in order to prevent title vesting absolutely in the vendee were purely obiter.\u00a0 Such a rule has certainly never been adopted in this jurisdiction.\u00a0 On the contrary, the settled rule, as evidenced by the four decisions discussed above is that a bona fide offer of the redemption price, where that is certain and fixed, is sufficient to preserve the vendor's right of action in cases where the offer is refused.\u00a0 These four decisions dealing, as they do, with a rule of property, and extending over a period of years, cannot be lightly disregarded.\u00a0 They must be held to have crystallized the rule which must obtain in this jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>For the above reasons, we are of the opinion that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.\u00a0 The judgment appealed from is reversed, and the cause remanded, with instructions to require the defendants to answer, without costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Johnson<\/i> and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"CENTER\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">DISSENTING<\/span><br\/><\/div><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">TORRES, J., <\/span><br\/><br\/>I feel that I must dissent from the majority opinion, because I think that the decision rendered in accordance therewith undoubtedly takes for granted the final resolution of this litigation.<br\/><br\/>The declaration made by the majority of the court in its decision\u00a0 that facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action are alleged in the complaint is due to the fact that the contract of sale under <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, executed on July 29, 1902, contains an express stipulation that the\u00a0 repurchase could not be made before the lapse of three years reckoned from said date, wherefore it was held that the period of four years fixed in article 1508 of the Civil Code did not begin to run from the date of the contract, July 29, 1902, but from July 29, 1905, that is, after the three years at the end of which only the repurchase of the land sold could he effected.<br\/><br\/>No express agreement appears in the notarial instrument setting forth the contract in question regarding the period within which the vendor might repurchase the tract sold, and therefore in the absence of express agreement the right to redeem the land would subsist and could be exercised during the four years fixed in said\u00a0 article 1508, a period reckoned from the date of the contract, according to the positive provision of that article.<br\/><br\/>It is then unquestionable that the parties did not stipulate any period for the redemption or repurchase of the land sold with right of repurchase and consequently, in the absence of express agreement, as the law says, the\u00a0 right of repurchase will last four years from the date of the contract.<br\/><br\/>It is contrary to the positive provision of the law, in my humble opinion, to declare that, by reason of the agreement that the repurchase could not be made until the three years reckoned from the date of the contract had\u00a0 elapsed, the four years fixed by the law, in view of the silence of the contracting parties, would run after said three years, or for the remainder of the period of ten years which the law allows as the maximum in case a period is stipulated.<br\/><br\/>We do not find any provision of law prohibiting this stipulation that the land sold could not be redeemed until three years had elapsed, and by this lack of prohibition of such an agreement the free right of contract is acknowledged, provided that what is contracted be not contrary to law, morality, or public order.<br\/><br\/>Admitting, then, that the contracting parties could have stipulated such a condition it would not therefore be permissible to affirm that in such case and in the absence of express agreement regarding the period of repurchase it must be held that the period of four years fixed by said article 1508 of the Code should only begin to run after the lapse\u00a0 of the three years stipulated, during which the tract sold could not be repurchased by the vendor.<br\/><br\/>So far as we know there is no article in the code, nor do we know of any special law or any legal precedent established by the decisions of the courts, which would authorize such a belief to the effect that the basis of reckoning the four years fixed by the law for the redemption, when the contracting parties have not set any period therefor, should be different from the date of the contract itself.\u00a0 The provision of\u00a0 article 1508 is positive and ought not to be understood otherwise than that the period of four years begins to run from the date of the contract, when the contracting parties have not stipulated any period.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer overruled, it is inferred from the decision of the majority of the court that the period of four years had not even yet\u00a0 elapsed when in the month of January, 1908, the plaintiff, in substitution of the vendor, Maximino Rivera, avers without proof that he proposed to the defendants to acquire by repurchase the land in question, just as in the decision it is held, that facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action were alleged.<br\/><br\/>By this finding the exception which the defendants might allege\u2014that the period of four years fixed by the law and reckoned from July\u00a0 29, 1912, has elapsed\u2014is taken for granted, for in the opinion of the majority of the court said four years only began to run from July 29, 1905, a holding that we doubt will encounter support in any article of the code or in the decisions of the courts.<br\/><br\/>Although the question of whether the mere offer of payment, even though proven and made in good faith, be sufficient to hold that the first paragraph of article 1518 of the Civil Code has been complied with, ought not to be discussed,, in view of my opinion that the period of four years had more than elapsed when the alleged offer to repurchase was made in January, 1908, still I wish to take it up, because I also do not agree that the mere offer of repurchase and of payment of the price of the sale would be\u00a0 sufficient, for the reason that said\u00a0 positive article of the code says that the vendor cannot exercise the right of repurchase without paying back to the purchaser the price of the sale; and to pay back is\u00a0 not merely to offer, but actually to settle and pay the price of the sale, and in case the vendor refuses to accept it to deposit it in due form.<br\/><br\/>The various cases cited in the majority opinion do not demonstrate that the mere offer of payment would be sufficient.\u00a0 The law is held therein to have been fulfilled for the reason that the vendors\u00a0 did all they could to comply with the indispensable requisite of paying back to the purchaser the price of the sale, as said article 1518 of the code requires.<br\/><br\/>In the decision in the case of Angao <i>vs<\/i>. Clavano (17 Phil. Rep., 152), the following principle was laid down:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is not sufficient for the vendor to state to the vendee that the former desires to redeem the thing sold, but he must immediately tender the reimbursement price, and, should the vendee\u00a0 refuse to accept, the vendor must deposit the said price, for, according to article 1509 of the Civil Code, if the vendor does not comply with the provisions of\u00a0 article 1518, the vendee shall irrevocably acquire the ownership of the thing sold.\"<\/blockquote>This principle has been affirmed by the supreme court of Spain in\u00a0 decisions, among others, of December 31, 1897, and October 16, 1906.\u00a0 In the latter the following principles are set forth:<br\/><blockquote>\"Repurchase in legal form is not made unless the plaintiff pay back to the defendant the price of the sale or, if necessary, deposit it, according to article 1518 of the Civil Code and 1618 of the code of procedure.<br\/><br\/>\"Offer of the value of the property to be repurchased is not equivalent to payment of the sum, which is what repayment means, as indispensable in every transaction wherein attempt is made to exercise the right of repurchase stipulated for the consummation of the sale.\"<\/blockquote>Such is the true and exact meaning of the provision of the code as set forth by the decisions of the supreme court, and thus also do the commentators, among them the accredited expounder Manresa, understand it, so I regret that I cannot accept as a rule established in this country in accord with the provision of the Civil Code that an offer of the price of repurchase is sufficient to protect the right of the vendor in case the vendee refuses to deliver the property sold under right of repurchase.\u00a0 To offer the price is not to pay it back, as the law directs.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons it seems to me that it would be strictly lawful and just to affirm the order appealed from, with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"CENTER\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic;\">DISSENTING<br\/><\/div><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">MORELAND, J.,<\/span><br\/><br\/>I agree with the dissenting opinion of Justice Torres, in so far as it holds that the redemption under the sale with a right to repurchase must take\u00a0 place within four years from the date of the\u00a0 instrument.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that, under the provisions of article 1508 of the Civil Code, in the absence of an express agreement, the right to repurchase expires four years from the date of the contract.\u00a0 The only term in the instrument in question with respect to time is that \"it is agreed also that the repurchase shall not take place until three years from this date.\"\u00a0 This provision is precisely the\u00a0 reverse of that which gives the right referred to in the articles of the Civil Code relating to conventional redemption.\u00a0 It does not prescribe a period within which the repurchase can be made, but, rather, one within which it can <i>not<\/i> be made.\u00a0\u00a0 No time being stated in the instrument within which the repurchase may be made, it falls within the provisions of the first paragraph of article 1508, quoted in the opinion of Justice Torres, and the right to repurchase prescribes four years from the date of the contract.<br\/><br\/>The complaint sets forth the instrument in question, which bears date the 29th of July, 1902, and also alleges that offer of payment was not made until January, 1908.\u00a0 It, therefore, shows upon its face that the action cannot be maintained.<br\/><br\/>Under the Spanish authorities, the time within which the repurchase may be made is not regarded as a statute of limitations but as a provision which goes to the validity of the contract; and an agreement to extend beyond the period prescribed is null and void.<br\/><br\/>The question, therefore, as to whether or not the question of the statute of limitations can be raised by demurrer is not involved.<br\/><br\/>The complaint showing upon its face that there is no cause of action, no other question remains to be discussed.<br\/><\/div>",

I., did willfully, unlawfully, and criminally and by means of intimidation and deceit seduce and\u00a0 at various times have carnal relations with the girl Lorenza Sanchez, 15 years of age, daughter of the undersigned, said Lorenza then living in the house of the said accused and under his care, and as a result of these carnal relations the said Lorenza gave birth to a female child on June 21, 1911; in violation of article 443 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>\"Cervantes, June 19, 1912.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">\u00a0(Sgd.)\u00a0 \"LUISA VALDEZ.\"<\/div><\/blockquote>Upon said complaint the defendant was duly arrested and arraigned.\u00a0 Upon arraignment he pleaded not guilty.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable Charles S.

The court erred in denying the motion for dismissal presented by the counsel for the defendant on the ground of said court's lack of Jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The trial court erred in holding that it had jurisdiction to hear and decide the case.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The court's decision is erroneous in so far as it attributes the paternity [of the child] of the alleged offended party to the herein defendant-appellant.<br\/><br\/>\"4. The court likewise erred in finding the defendant guilty of the crime under prosecution.<br\/><br\/>\"5. Consequently the court erred in not acquitting the defendant of the crime imputed to him.\"<\/blockquote>The first and second assignments of error we think may be considered together.\u00a0 They each relate to the jurisdiction of the lower court.\u00a0 At the time the prosecution rested, the attorney for the defendant presented a motion asking the court to dismiss the case on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the person of the accused and the subject matter, because the complaint was not signed, filed, and presented by the father of a minor, the offended party, but by the mother.\u00a0 That motion was overruled by the lower court The ruling of the lower court on said motion is now assigned as error here.\u00a0 The lower court in his decision denying said motion, among other things said, that inasmuch as the fact that the complaint had not been presented by the father appeared upon the face of the complaint, the objection should have been raised by demurrer, and\u00a0 that, inasmuch as it had not been raised by demurrer, the defendant had gone to trial upon said complaint, and it was too late to raise the objection that the court was without jurisdiction.\u00a0 The question of the jurisdiction of a court may be raised at any time.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Castaiiares, 18 Phil. Rep., 210; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Narvas, 14 Phil. Rep., 410; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. De los Santos, 21 Phil. Rep., 404; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Asuncion, 22 Phil.

J. Robertson was a police official known as a <i>comandante<\/i> of the Province of Cebu, having his official residence in Cebu, the capital of said province.\u00a0 On said date the two Chinamen Yap Shut and Te Tong, together with others, were surprised in a gambling game known as <i>jueteng<\/i> and were arrested and charged with gambling.\u00a0 At the time of making the arrest the police officials seized various books belonging to the person in charge of the game, together with other articles and utensils used therein.\u00a0 These books and articles were kept under the personal supervision of <i>Comandante<\/i> Robertson, who placed them in an iron safe in\u00a0 his office.\u00a0 On the night of the 30th of August an unknown Chinaman was found by Robertson conversing with his Chinese cook in the kitchen.\u00a0 Robertson asked the cook who the Chinaman was.\u00a0 In reply the cook informed him that the Chinaman desired to speak with him regarding certain books which had been seized during the gambling raid made just previously, saying that certain interested Chinamen desired to be allowed to remove the books from Robertson's possession and substitute others in their place.\u00a0 Robertson thereupon agreed to make the substitution provided that he was paid a sufficient sum of money therefor.\u00a0 Thereupon the unknown Chinaman departed.<br\/><br\/>On the night of the 1st of September following, the accused Te Tong went to Robertson's house, saying to him that he brought with him a sum of money as a consideration for the substitution of the books.\u00a0 Prior to that time Robertson had made arrangements with two members of the police force to place themselves secretly in a position where they could see and hear all that passed between him and the Chinaman.\u00a0 Robertson lighted the lamp, opened his iron safe and took out the books.\u00a0 The Chinaman Te Tong thereupon began to examine the books, picking out two of the larger ones, they being those that contained evidence very damaging to his case.\u00a0 After having picked out the books Te Tong delivered to Robertson other books similar in appearance which were to be used as substitutes.\u00a0 After the substitution had been made Robertson asked Te Tong for the money which he had offered to pay for the substitution.\u00a0 Te Tong answered that the money was at his house; but Robertson insisted upon immediate payment, and the Chinaman thereupon drew from his pocket a roll of bills amounting to P500 and delivered it to Robertson.\u00a0 As the Chinaman started to leave the office Robertson called to the two policemen who came forward and stated that they had seen and heard all that had transpired.\u00a0 The Chinaman was then arrested.<br\/><br\/>The facts are proved beyond shadow of doubt.\u00a0 The only question is whether the crime is attempted, frustrated, or consummated bribery.\u00a0 In similar cases we have held the crime to be attempted.\u00a0\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Sy-Suikao, 18 Phil. Rep., 482; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Paua, 6 Phil. Rep., 740; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Camacan, 7 Phil. Rep., 329; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Tan Gee, 7 Phil. Rep., 738.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Sy-Suikao, above, it appeared that the defendant offered an officer of the Bureau of Internal Revenue P5 a barrel for each and every barrel of spirits which that officer would permit the defendant to withdraw from the warehouse in which it was stored without exacting1 the taxes which under the law the defendant would otherwise have been obliged to pay.\u00a0 The officer pretended to accept the offer and to enter into the proposed agreement, but, as a matter of fact, reported the matter to his superiors and procured the arrest of the defendant after five barrels of spirits had been removed from the warehouse under the agreement.\u00a0 The crime was held to be attempted bribery.<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Paua (6 Phil. Rep., 740), the court dealt\u00a0 with a case in which the accused paid to one Frank C. Lane, inspector of hulls and boilers of the customhouse of Manila, the sum of P200 as a guaranty of an agreement to pay P500\u00a0 in case said Lane would issue a certificate for the steamer <i>Iru\u00f1a<\/i>, although the said steamer did not then fulfill the conditions required to receive a certificate to go\u00a0 to sea.\u00a0 While pretending to accept said sum Lane was in reality trying to entrap the accused and immediately thereafter reported the matter to his superiors and to the police.\u00a0 The crime in that case was held to be attempted bribery.<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Camacan (7 Phil. Rep., 329) it appeared that certain Constabulary officers were set to guard a corral in which was kept a considerable number of carabaos.\u00a0 On the night of the day on which the Constabulary officers took possession of the corral Camacan approached one of the officers and offered him P40 for the privilege of removing from the corral four of the\u00a0 carabaos.\u00a0 The officer accepted the agreement.\u00a0 The P40 was paid, P10 in cash and a promissory note for P30.\u00a0 The carabaos were not, however, in reality delivered to the accused, the Constabulary officer seeking simply to entrap him.\u00a0 The crime committed in that case was held to be attempted bribery.<br\/><br\/>The case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Tan Gee (7 Phil. Rep., 738) was of a similar nature, and the crime in that case was held to be that of attempted bribery.<br\/><br\/>While\u00a0 there is some authority to the contrary, we are of the opinion that we should follow the substantially uniform holding of this court which declares the crime to be attempted bribery.<br\/><br\/>The judgment is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Arlante (9 Phil.\u00a0 Rep., 595), where the head of a family seduced an orphan girl,\u00a0 a relative of his wife living in his house, that the word <i>domestic<\/i> as used in this article is not restricted to servants.\u00a0 In that case the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"And even though the accused were not, as a matter of fact, in charge of the keeping of the offended girl, it is beyond doubt that, as she was a domestic, the crime is included within paragraph 1 of said article (art. 443).\u00a0 'Upon the word <i>domestic<\/i> being employed in said legal provision segregating it from that of servant, the term is applied to persons usually living under the same roof, pertaining to the same house, and constituting, in this sense, a part thereof, distinguishing it from the term <i>servant<\/i> whereby a person serving another on a salary is designated; in this manner, it has been properly used.' (Decision in cassation dated November 11, 1881.)\" <\/blockquote>That this interpretation of the term <i>domestic<\/i> is a wholesome one, founded upon the soundest principles of law and morality, requires no argument.\u00a0 By reason of the intimacy and confidence existing between the various members of a household, opportunities for the commission of this crime are more frequent, and this makes the crime of seduction by one in such a position as reprehensible as, and is on a par with, the betrayal of the trust reposed in any other of those persons enumerated in the first paragraph of the above quoted articles.<br\/><br\/>The term <i>domestic<\/i> not being restricted to servants, it remains to be seen whether it is sufficiently broad to include the appellant in the case at bar.\u00a0 The case decided by the supreme court of Spain on\u00a0 January 30, 1891, is chiefly relied upon by the defendant.\u00a0 That case, however, is easily distinguishable from the case at bar.\u00a0 The defendant in that case was merely stopping at a public <i>inn or tavern<\/i> when he seduced the landlord's daughter, the court holding that the defendant was not a domestic.\u00a0\u00a0 Following this case, the argument for the defendant seems to be based chiefly upon the fact that the defendant's residence in the home of the injured girl was not permanent but temporary, and that he was paying for his accommodations.\u00a0 These considerations can have little, if any, bearing upon the qualification of the crime.\u00a0 The important question is, Were the parties members of the same household at the time the defendant seduced the girl?\u00a0\u00a0 A review of the cases decided by the supreme court of Spain shows conclusively that this is the important question.<br\/><br\/>In the case dated November 11, 1881 (cited in the quotation from U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Arlante, <i>supra<\/i>), it appears that the defendant was living in the home of the complainant and paying for his accommodations, when he seduced the daughter of the family.\u00a0 It will be noted, however, from the above excerpt from the decision of the court, that he was regarded as one of the family circle.\u00a0 These facts are substantially parallel with those of the case at bar.<br\/><br\/>In the case elated April 21, 1897, the seduced girl had been sent to the home of the defendant (an intimate friend of her family) to convalesce from a severe illness.\u00a0 While thus temporarily residing there, she was seduced by the defendant, who was the head of the family.\u00a0 The court held that the term domestic covered the case, although the defendant might also be considered as having had the seduced girl under his care at the time.<br\/><br\/>In the decision of February 13, 1900, the court had under consideration a case where the defendant seduced a servant girl working in his brother's home, the defendant residing with his brother at the time.\u00a0 The court held that the case should be considered as coming within the term <i>domestic<\/i> as used in article 443.<br\/><br\/>In the case decided September 29, 1909, a college student was spending his Ghristmas vacation at his mother's home when he seduced a servant girl.\u00a0 His conviction under article 443 as a domestic of the household was affirmed.<br\/><br\/>In all these cases the residence of at least one of the parties was of a temporary character, and the consideration involved in a contract with household servants is, to say the least, as mercenary as that which induced the family in the present case to receive the defendant into the sanctity of the home.<br\/><br\/>In the present case both parties were relatives of the family with which they resided.\u00a0 While it is true that the defendant was not permanently residing with this family and that he was paying for his food and lodging it is unquestionable that he was treated as one of the family circle.\u00a0 It was rather from the fact that he was a kinsman than from any idea of profit on the small pittance the defendant paid for his\u00a0 board and lodging that he was received into the privacy of the home.\u00a0 His standing in that home was vastly different from that of a stranger paying for his food and lodging at an <i>inn or hotel<\/i>, who is not tendered nor expects to receive those sentimental and confidential manifestations of intimacy exchanged between members of the same household.<br\/><br\/>We are therefore of the opinion that the lower court correctly held that the defendant was a domestic within the meaning of that term as used in article 443.\u00a0 The judgment appealed from being strictly in accordance with the law and the merits of the case, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs of this instance against the defendant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

G. Employee, ordered to Fort Russell, Wyoming.\"\u00a0 This was written on April 10.\u00a0 Were the\u00a0 orders\u00a0 directing him to\u00a0 go to the United States for duty at another station canceled between April 10 and April 12, and between April 12 and April 14, when Mr, Filmer actually departed for the United States, reissued; or did Mr. Filmer tell a deliberate falsehood to the defendant in order to get the money which it is claimed he borrowed; or did Filmer ever execute this indorsement and this note?\u00a0 There is no evidence, and in the absence of any, we cannot presume that the orders for his transfer to a station in America were withdrawn and then reissued within a week of the time he departed.\u00a0 The deceit he must have employed to obtain the money otherwise is negatived as is best stated in the words of the defendant himself:\u00a0 \"Filmer is one of the few men that has gone back to the States promising to pay his debts who has tried to carry out his agreements.\"\u00a0 Would the defendant have made this statement if Filmer had obtained the money by fraudulent representations?\u00a0 To impute to Mr. Filmer such a disreputable method for securing funds is to forget that he faithfully kept his promise to remit funds for the payment of his debts in Manila.\u00a0 And the defendant does not even claim that Filmer deceived him in this manner.<br\/><br\/>Again, it will be noted that in speaking of this loan, the defendant stated that the amount loaned was P225, while later on in his testimony he stated that the amount actually loaned to Mr. Filmer was P200.<br\/><br\/>The existence of this note seems to have been utterly ignored by Kosel in his conversations with the various creditors of Filmer, several months after the latter had left the Philippines.\u00a0 While the indorsement on Exhibit A requires that the Kosel note be given preference in the payment of Filmer's Manila debts, and while the note does as a matter of fact show that all the remittances for the first several months were applied to it, nevertheless, in none of his conversations with the merchants to whom Filmer was owing money did Kosel make any mention of the existence of such a note.\u00a0 On the contrary, in his conversations with McGrath and Weems, at least, he spoke of a board bill taking precedence over all other items, and that he had in fact made a payment upon that board bill.\u00a0 On the witness stand the defendant stated that he had paid none of the Manila creditors of Filmer.\u00a0 Not only were defendant's statements to McGrath and Weems inconsistent with his statements on the witness stand, but they were inconsistent with his conduct at the time they were made.\u00a0 At the very time he told these merchants\u00a0 that he had paid a part of the board bill, he was, according to the Kosel and Kidd notes, promptly crediting every cent remitted to one or the other of these notes.<br\/><br\/>Again, in his conversation with Bamberger, who had been delegated by Filmer to make an investigation of his accounts with Kosel, when, if ever, it would be expected that he would court the fullest inquiry, although he stated offhand the total amount he had received from Filmer, he again failed to mention either of these notes.\u00a0 The defendant testified that he had accumulated several thousand letters in the course of his business operations.\u00a0 We may assume, therefore, that he had a number of clients and was doing more or less business.\u00a0 If he could remember without reference to his records how much one of these clients had sent him over a period of several months, it is strange that he should find it necessary to say to one who was inquiring about how these remittances had been distributed that he would bring the papers around in a day or two, when he had applied all of such remittances to a personal note due himself.\u00a0 The only <i>papers<\/i> necessary to show the disposition Kosel had made of the first four remittances was the Kosel\u00a0 note itself.\u00a0 Kosel could not have been without the simple explanation of the manner in which these remittances had been applied when this conversation took place. Yet he evaded the issue and promised to bring the papers around in a day or two.\u00a0 He did this twice within a couple of weeks.<br\/><br\/>This note shows credits amounting to P210, leaving only P15 due.\u00a0 The first four remittances of Filmer were credited on this note and it was then held by Kosel, arid further remittances received in December and January of fifty pesos each were credited to the Kidd note.\u00a0 In February a further credit of ten pesos was entered on the Kosel note, although enough was received in this month to more than liquidate it.\u00a0 This procedure is not consistent with the indorsement on Exhibit A, which provides that the Kosel note shall be paid first of all.\u00a0 According to this arrangement, the remainder of the Kosel note should have been more than paid by the remittance received in December and the note returned to Filmer.\u00a0 It would also have been more reasonable to expect Kosel to secure his own personal note first instead of one in his hands for collection only.<br\/><br\/>Again, the letters of Filmer introduced by the defense show that he never received receipts (see Exhibit H, quoted above) for at least the first three remittances he sent to Kosel.\u00a0 As these letters were introduced by the defense, there can be no objection to accepting their contents as true.\u00a0 Yet Kosel stated positively\u00a0 on\u00a0 the witness stand that he had sent acknowledgments for every\u00a0 remittance as received, and produced carbon copies of the letters he claimed to have sent.\u00a0 He stated that these letters were placed in official envelopes of his agency, bearing its name, with directions to return to sender within five days if not called for, and that he was certain these letters had been mailed, as he was in the habit of taking all the mail to the post office himself.\u00a0 The only way in which the statements in Filmer's letters can be reconciled with the testimony of Kosel is by concluding that all\u00a0 of these acknowledgments were lost in the mail.<br\/><br\/>Moore on Facts (vol. 1, sec. 551), in speaking of the presumption of receipt of a letter sent by mail, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Where the\u00a0 envelope bears the name and address of the sender, with a request to return to him if not delivered, the presumption of due receipt 'becomes well-nigh conclusive.\"<\/blockquote>In the present case it must be remembered that not only one but several such letters were lost.\u00a0 There was no money or other thing of value inclosed, and the addressee was stationed at one place all the time.\u00a0 That such letters, plainly directed, should fail to reach the addressee, if sent, cannot be believed.\u00a0 The fact that the letters or at least some of them would have been received by Filmer and that his statements in Exhibits E and H are not only hot questioned by the defense, but that there could not have been the slightest motive for him to make them falsely, inevitably leads to the conclusion that these letters were never, mailed by the defendant, and that his testimony in this respect is false.<br\/><br\/>The prosecution introduced Chauncey\u00a0 McGovern as a handwriting expert, who testified to the effect that both the signature to the indorsement on Exhibit A and to the Kosel note were false.\u00a0 On this\u00a0 appeal we are requested to disregard this testimony because of alleged inconsistencies in his testimony.\u00a0 Before discussing his testimony it is well to note that it is not contended that he did not qualify as a handwriting expert.\u00a0 His opinion appears to have been formed after an unbiased examination of a number of Filmer's signatures, among which were the two in question, and from his own description of his qualifications, the veracity of which is not disputed, it appears that his opinion was entitled to consideration.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Gil, 13 Phil. Rep., 530.)\u00a0 The value of\u00a0 the opinion of a handwriting expert depends not upon his mere statement of whether a writing is genuine or false, but upon the assistance he may afford in pointing out distinguishing marks, characteristics, and discrepancies in and between genuine and false specimens of writings\u00a0 which would ordinarily escape notice or detection from an unpracticed observer.\u00a0 There is no doubt that superior skill along these lines will often serve to direct the attention of the court to facts, assent to which is yielded not because of persuasion or argument on the part of the expert, but by their own intrinsic merit and reasonableness.\u00a0 It is a well-known fact, and was stated by the witness in this case, that very, rarely, if ever, will any two specimens of a person's signature be exactly alike, For this reason, arguments based upon minute similarities or dissimilarities find little favor and have very little weight in the courts.\u00a0 But glaring inconsistencies between a disputed signature and a number of genuine signatures are not in the same class.\u00a0 We have before us at least ten genuine signatures of Paul M. Filmer, besides the two in dispute.\u00a0 The expert in this case has pointed out several dissimilarities between the disputed signatures and the genuine signatures which we believe are entitled to attention.\u00a0 The top of the letter \"a\" in \"Paul\" in the disputed signatures is absolutely closed and the stroke which starts the back of this letter drops below the line which connects the capital \"P\" with the point where the letter \"a\" starts.\u00a0 In nearly all of the genuine signatures the same \"a\" is open at the top, and in the one or two instances where it is closed, the back stroke has no tendency at all to drop below the stroke connecting it with the capital \"P.\"\u00a0 The letter \"I\" in \"Filmer\" in both of the disputed signatures has a broken-back appearance which is not true of the same letter in any of the genuine signatures.\u00a0 The final stroke of the \"r\" in \"Filmer\" in the disputed signatures has a backward tendency which is also lacking in all the genuine signatures.\u00a0 \"Filmer\" in\u00a0 both of the disputed signatures and the capital \"M\" in the signature to the indorsement on Exhibit A show unmistakable signs of \"painting,\" while no retouching is discernible in any of the genuine\u00a0 signatures.\u00a0 And finally, there is a noticeable slurring of the \"m\" in \"Filmer\" in the disputed signatures which is wholly lacking in the genuine signatures.\u00a0 Over and above these similarities between the two disputed signatures and their variance with all of the\u00a0 genuine signatures is the fact, visible to all, that there is a dash and swing to the genuine signatures wholly lacking in the\u00a0 disputed ones.\u00a0 The pen strokes of the latter\u00a0 present a labored and lifeless appearance, as though carefully and slowly\u00a0 written.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that these arguments clearly indicate that the two disputed signatures are not genuine.\u00a0 Taken in connection with what we have already observed in regard to this transaction, the conclusion is irresistible that kosel forged Filmer's signature to the indorsement on.\u00a0 Exhibit A an4 the promissory note to cover his own misappropriation of the remittances made to him by Filmer.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding these facts, however, a mere acknowledgement from Filmer that the Kosel note was genuine would doubtless have cleared the defendant on this score so far as any judicial inquiry was concerned.<br\/><br\/>After the evidence was all in, counsel for the defense asked for a continuance in order that the deposition of Mr. Filmer might be obtained.\u00a0 The court granted a continuance of ninety days for this purpose.\u00a0 A number of questions were prepared, the answers to which would require Filmer to either acknowledge the note or repudiate it as a forgery.\u00a0 The deposition was received and the case reopened.\u00a0 The following excerpt from the record is self-explanatory:<br\/><blockquote>\"Counsel for the defendant then\u00a0 stated in open court that the deposition, the taking of which on\u00a0 the part of the defendant was one of the reasons for formally continuing the trial, would not be offered in evidence.\"<\/blockquote>The deposition of Filmer is therefore not before the court.\u00a0 We can only presume that Paul M. Filmer's deposition was unfavorable to the defendant, (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Schindler, 10 Fed. Rep., 547;\u00a0 State <i>vs<\/i>. McAllister, 24 Me., 139; People <i>vs<\/i>. Hovey, 92\u00a0 N. Y., 554; People <i>vs<\/i>. McGarry, 136 Mich., 316; 99 N. W., 147; Gordon <i>vs<\/i>. People, 33 N. Y., 501; Underhill on Crim. Ev., \u00a7 68.)\u00a0 This presumption adds to the weight of the adverse testimony respecting\u00a0 the execution of the note, Exhibit B.<br\/><br\/>There is not, in the whole record, any direct evidence that Filmer did not sign the Kosel note.\u00a0 Even the denial of such a fact by Filmer himself is not before us.\u00a0 If we disregard the statement of the defendant that Filmer did sign the note in his presence, there is still the evidence of the signature itself to the indorsement on Exhibit A and to the note in question.\u00a0 But can these signatures overcome the formidable array of facts negativing indirectly the genuineness of these documents?\u00a0 There is positive evidence before us of false statements made by the defendant in the execution of his agency.\u00a0 To hold that the second signature on Exhibit A and the signature on Exhibit B are genuine requires that Filmer obtained the money by fraudulent representations, which is\u00a0 neither in harmony with his subsequent actions in faithfully\u00a0 complying with his promises to make monthly remittances until his Manila creditors were paid nor with defendant's unbroken silence on the subject.\u00a0 There is positive expert testimony in the record that the signatures are false.\u00a0 The defendant's dealings with his creditors belie the existence of this note.\u00a0 If the note was genuine, there was no reason for him to give them to understand, thathe was applying remittances as received to debts about town when in fact he was applying them to the payment of,a personal loan made by himself to the absent debtor.\u00a0 The same duplicity was present in his dealings with Bamberger, who had been delegated to investigate the matter.\u00a0 If the note was genuine, why did he leave P25 unpaid and apply further remittances to another account instead of complying with the indorsement on Exhibit A by paying the said note first of all and then returning it to the maker?\u00a0 No explanation is furnished by the defendant on this point.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the defendant's assertion to the contrary, from all the reliable evidence at hand, the defendant never advised Filmer of the status of his accounts in this city.\u00a0 This continued silence on his part in the face of repeated inquiries from Filmer regarding his remittances does not indicate a proper regard for his duties as an agent.\u00a0 After securing the deposition of Filmer, who, if anybody could, was able to proclaim his innocence, the defendant refused to submit it to the court.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that the indorsement on Exhibit A and the Kosel note were never seen by Filmer and had no existence at the time Filmer departed for the United States.<br\/><br\/>Many of the objections made in reference to the Kosel note are applicable also to the Kidd note.\u00a0 Its existence was likewise concealed from the various persons interested in the remittances which Filmer was making.\u00a0 It is admitted that it was not among the list of debts submitted to Kosel on April 10, 1911, with\u00a0 Exhibit A.\u00a0 Although defendant states that he notified Filmer of this note and that he was going to apply further remittances to it, and that in a letter accompanying a remittance of P30 Filmer had made statements which seemed to bear out all his actions with reference to this note, he could not produce this letter, and subsequently he testified that he could not say without looking at his letters whether Filmer had ever mentioned the Kidd note.\u00a0 Among the questions prepared and which should have been answered in Filmer's deposition were a number which would\u00a0 have cleared up any doubt as to whether Filmer actually signed this\u00a0 note and as to whether he had agreed that it should be paid out of the remittances.\u00a0 But as this deposition was not produced in evidence, we can only assume that its contents would have been unfavorable to the defendant in these respects also.\u00a0 No authority was produced by the defendant for his action in applying remittances to this note.\u00a0 There is no question but that the P120 indorsement and payment as claimed by the defendant to have been made on the Kidd note was not in compliance with his obligation, and the defendant has in this respect unquestionably violated the provisions of article 535, subidivision 5 thereof, of the Penal Code also.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court is therefore affirmed, provided, however, that the defendant shall be further sentenced to indentify Paul M. Filmer in the sum of P330, to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to the accessory penalties provided by law the costs of this instance shall also be taxed against the defendant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Any person who shall disturb or interrupt any ceremony of a religious character in any manner not falling within the provisions of section 3, chapter 2, title 2 of book 2 of this code.\"<br\/><br\/>The twenty-first article of the Spanish constitution of 1869 provided for a state religion, but also guaranteed the privilege of freely practicing, both in public and private, the forms and ceremonies of other sects, subject only to the restrictions imposed by general law and morality.\u00a0 Under this constitution the Penal Code of Spain, now in effect, was promulgated in 1870.\u00a0 As a consequence of the removal of all restrictions upon the exercise of religious beliefs, the Penal Code of Spain, enacted in 1870, in its chapter on crimes against religion, is wholly impersonal.\u00a0 In none of its articles (Nos. 236 to 241) is any particular religion mentioned, but offenses against religion, as such,\u00a0 are defined and penalized.\u00a0 The heading of the chapter is \"Crimes relative to the free exercise of religion (<i>los cultos<\/i>).\"<\/blockquote>The constitution of 1876, in Spain, which is still in force, after providing for a state religion, guaranteed that no one in Spanish territory would be molested for his religious opinions, nor for observing the forms of his faith, provided due respect were shown for Christian morals.\u00a0 By this same article, however, only the followers of the state religion could engage in public ceremonies or other manifestations.\u00a0 It will be noted that this article materially modified article 21 of the former constitution.\u00a0 While everyone could still worship God in his own manner, it was no longer permissible for cults other than the state religion to demonstrate their religious beliefs in public.<br\/><br\/>It was under this constitution that the Penal Code for the Philippine Islands was promulgated in 1884.\u00a0 As a consequence its provisions are considerably different from those of the Spanish Penal Code.\u00a0 Of the eight articles defining and penalizing \"Crimes\u00a0 against religion and worship\" (which is the title of the chapter), six refer specially and solely to crimes against the state religion.\u00a0 The only crime specifically defined against religions other than that of the state is for disturbing, by means of violence, threats, etc., their ceremonies when conducted in cemeteries or other places where such ceremonies may be lawfully authorized.\u00a0 (Art. 225.)<br\/><br\/>The change of sovereignty and the enactment of the fourteenth paragraph of section 5 of the Philippine Bill caused the complete separation of church and state, and the abolition of all special privileges and all restrictions theretofore conferred or imposed upon any particular religious sect.\u00a0 All became equal in the eyes of the law, and those articles of the Penal Code defining special crimes against that denomination which, under the former sovereign, was the state religion, as well as article 225, defining a crime against all others than that religion, necessarily became inoperative.\u00a0 Only those articles of the Penal Code which refer to all religions equally and without distinction can now be considered as in effect.\u00a0 They appear to be two in number, viz, articles 223 and 571.<br\/><br\/>Let us first examine article 223, from which, neither by the specific language used nor by implication, can it be inferred that any\u00a0 particular religious doctrine was in the minds of the code makers.\u00a0 What was the object and purpose of this section?\u00a0 It will be remembered that at the time this article became law, all faiths not opposed to Christian morals were, under the constitution of Spain, tolerated.\u00a0 According to the terms of the constitution, everyone had the right to worship his Maker in his own manner;\u00a0 and as a corollary no one could be compelled to indorse a particular creed.\u00a0 Were it lawful to prevent the one or exact the other, the terms of the constitution would have become a dead letter.\u00a0 As is usual with constitutions, no penalty was attached to this article.\u00a0 It remained for the legislature in the course of its ordinary legislation to provide for its enforcement.\u00a0 In order to instil respect for this constitutional provision, it was necessary to provide a punishment for anyone who sought to interfere with the religious beliefs of his fellow citizens.\u00a0 A glance at the other articles of the Penal Code in the chapter we are discussing shows that none of the crimes defined and punished therein would respond to a state of facts where both the will and conscience of a human being were being tampered with upon the subject of religion.\u00a0 The provisions of article 223 were relied upon to prevent such practices.\u00a0 The article says that \"the penalty\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 shall be imposed upon any person who\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 shall force some other person to perform an act of worship\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"\u00a0 In other words, any attempt, by coercive methods, to induce a person to worship God in a manner different from or to an extent greater than that person desired, constituted an abridgment of his constitutional right to believe or disbelieve, to regard or disregard the outer forms of a sect, even though he were a member of that sect.\u00a0 Whatever may have\u00a0 been the inducement for the passage of this article of the code, certainly it is in the closest harmony with the principles of government of the present sovereign, one of which is the greatest freedom of thought and speech consistent with public order upon religious matters.<br\/><br\/>The concluding portion of the article is, \"or prevent him from performing such act.\"\u00a0 History has perhaps demonstrated that it is a more common form of interference with freedom of religious thought to prevent a person from worshiping the Supreme Being according to the dictates of his own conscience than it is to force him to go through the forms of a religious ceremony in which he does not believe; but whether the one method or the other is adopted, it remains interference with religious freedom, which is incompatible with tolerance of all creeds as provided for in the Spanish constitution.\u00a0 To prevent a person from performing acts of devotion which he desires to perform for the sole reason that his creed does not meet with the approval of him who prevents them is as much a blow aimed at that constitutional right to religious belief as is the first method of requiring a person to perform acts of devotion against his will\u00a0 or conscience.\u00a0 Thus far the clause extends.\u00a0 But does it also extend to acts which, while preventing a person from performing an act of devotion, are not prompted by religious intolerance but from some other motive?\u00a0 It must be remembered that the great underlying purpose of this article is to prevent and punish religious intolerance.\u00a0 There is no reason for presuming that the code makers had in view mere disturbances of religious worship, since these offenses are provided for in other articles of the same chapter.\u00a0 Even less is it to be presumed that they had in mind offenses which, while perhaps seriously disturbing or preventing (for the time) religious services, were committed with\u00a0 some other object in view.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that an essential element of the crime of the crime defined and penalized under this article is the intent of the guilty person to coercively control the religious beliefs of another person.<br\/><br\/>The offense defined and punished by article 571, paragraph 1, of the Penal Code falls under the classification of \"Misdemeanors against the public order.\"\u00a0 Due to the fact that all the articles in section 3, chapter 2, of book 2, of the code, with the exception\u00a0 of\u00a0 article 223 have become inoperative, all offenses against religious cults which do not amount to an attempt to control the conscience of persons must now fall within the provisions of this article.\u00a0 While the punishment therein provided may be, in some instances, not sufficient, we are of the opinion that it, together with those provided for \"Threats and coercion,\" will serve as a sufficient deterrent, and instil a wholesome respect for the decorum and dignity of an assemblage gathered for religious devotion.\u00a0 We find it much easier to arrive at this conclusion after comparing this penalty with those provided in the jurisdictions of that country from whence came the clause of the Philippine Bill which insures to all religious orders in this country equal protection.\u00a0 Mere disturbances of religious worship in the United States are generally classified as misdemeanors only.\u00a0\u00a0 The increased severity of the punishments affixed to such penalties under the Penal Code is doubtless due to the long religious training of the nation which enacted the law and its recognition of a particular faith as a state religion.<br\/><br\/>Thus, the offense of the defendant falls within the provisions of article 223 or of article 571.\u00a0 The record fails to disclose the purpose of the defendant in committing the acts complained of.\u00a0 It is true that it is shown that the defendant was of the Aglipayan faith, while the members of the congregation were of a different sect, but none of the witnesses for the prosecution state that the defendant made any comment whatever upon religion.\u00a0 He simply threatened to assault them with a stick he was carrying if they did not stop the services.\u00a0 Under the circumstances, and considering that it is not proven that religious hatred prompted the defendant to act as he did, his offense appears to be simply that of disturbing or interrupting the religious services.\u00a0 An essential element of the crime provided for in article 223 was not proved and the court erred in finding him guilty of the crime therein defined.<br\/><br\/>It is further alleged that the people thus dispersed by the defendant were not holding religious services, as they were simply reading some verses out of the Bible.\u00a0 We have been unable to find any\u00a0 provision of law which requires religious services to be conducted in approved orthodox style in order to merit its protection against interference and disturbance.\u00a0 As stated in Hull <i>vs<\/i>. State (120 Ind., 153):<br\/><blockquote>\"It makes no difference that the method of worship of those assembled was singular or uncommon.\u00a0 The protection of the statute is extended to all, irrespective of creed, opinion, or mode of worship.<br\/><br\/>\"Persons who meet for the purpose of religious worship, by any method which is not indecent and unlawful, have a right to do so without being molested or disturbed.\"<\/blockquote>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the lower court is reversed, and the defendant is sentenced to ten days imprisonment [<i>arresto menor<\/i>], and a fine of P20, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency not to exceed one-third of the principal penalty, and to the payment of the costs of the cause.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Moreland, J<\/i>., concurs in the result.<br\/><\/div>",

MARIANO MELENDRES, INTERVENER AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an election contest involving the office of governor of the Province of Rizal.\u00a0 The only candidates whose rights need to be considered in this case are Mariano Melendres, Mamerto Manalo, and Catalino Sevilla.\u00a0 The election took place on the 4th day of June, 1912.\u00a0 The protest was filed on the 18th of the same month.\u00a0 On the face of the returns Sevilla had a plurality of the votes and was duly declared elected by the\u00a0 provincial board of canvassers under section 27 of the Election Law.\u00a0 Manalo filed the protest.\u00a0 Melendres presented a petition praying that he be permitted to intervene and take part in the contest.\u00a0 The prayer was granted and he was allowed to intervene.\u00a0 After due hearing the court found in favor of the protestant, Mamerto Manalo, and ordered the provincial board of canvassers to correct its canvass in accordance with the facts as found.\u00a0 Appeals were taken by Sevilla and Melendres.<br\/><br\/>There are several questions raised here which We proceed to discuss.<br\/><br\/>Question 1:\u00a0 Was the protest filed in time?<br\/><br\/>In regard to this question the discussion turned upon the interpretation of that clause of the Election Law which provides that the protest shall be made \"within two weeks after the election.\"\u00a0 Appellants contend (<i>a<\/i>) that the two weeks must be counted from election day\u2014that is, the day on which the votes were actually cast\u2014and (<i>b<\/i>) that, in so counting, the first day must be included and the last day excluded.\u00a0 Under this theory it is claimed that the protest came too late, having been made on the 15th day instead of the 14th, as required by law.<br\/><br\/>We stop only to discuss the first proposition, namely, that the time within which the protest must be filed is to be counted from the day on which the votes were cast, simply saying in regard to the other contention that, even if the first one is sound, still the protest was filed in time, as the correct method of computing the\u00a0 time is to exclude the first day and include the last.\u00a0 Two weeks from a Tuesday is not a Monday; and if one invites another to call on him two weeks from today (Monday) he would not expect him to disturb his quiet meditation by calling on Sunday.\u00a0 Two weeks from Tuesday, June 4, 1912, was Tuesday, June 18, 1912, and the 18th was as much within the two weeks as was the 15th.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the other, contention, we say at the outset that the question involved in that contention, in substance, has already been decided by this court in the case of Navarro <i>vs<\/i>. Veloso (23 Phil. Rep., 625).\u00a0 The reasons upon which that decision was based not having been fully set forth in the opinion, and the greater part of the arguments of counsel on this appeal having been directed to the question involved in that decision, we take the occasion to add to the reasons set out therein.<br\/><br\/>In that case we held that a protest concerning the office of provincial governor, filed prior to the proclamation of the provincial board of canvassers, was premature for the reason that\u00a0 it did not and could not, by reason of the time when the protest was filed, state facts sufficient to sustain a legal protest.\u00a0 In that case as in this the protest was filed before the recanvass by the provincial board of canvassers and before a proclamation of the result as required by section 24 of the Election Law.\u00a0 It came to us by way of an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Leyte, entered upon an order dismissing the protest on the\u00a0 ground that it did not allege\u00a0 that the respondent had been duly declared elected provincial governor by the provincial board of canvassers, but, on the contrary, affirmatively alleged that the respondent had been declared elected by the board of inspectors of the various precincts of the province.\u00a0 In that case we said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Of course, one of the fundamental facts necessary to appear before\u00a0 a contest can be maintained is the election of the person against whom the protest is made.\u00a0 If there is no election there can be no protest.\u00a0 The best\u00a0 evidence, in fact, the\u00a0 primary evidence of such election is, under the law, the\u00a0 proclamation\u00a0 of the provincial board of canvassers.\u00a0 It is nowhere alleged in the protest that such board proclaimed the election of the protestee.\u00a0 On the contrary, it affirmatively appears that such board did not do so, the protestant alleging that the protestee was declared elected by the various <i>municipal boards of inspectors.\" <\/i><\/blockquote>We consider question 1 from three aspects:<br\/><br\/>1. Let us take a concrete case:\u00a0 There are two candidates for the office of provincial governor; the protest is filed, issue is joined, the trial is had, and the judgment rendered before the meeting of the\u00a0 provincial board of canvassers.\u00a0 As we said in the case above cited, legally and logically speaking, a protest is impossible until the adversary of the protestant is <i>elected<\/i>.\u00a0 There being only two candidates, in the case assumed, if the respondent is not elected the protestant must be.\u00a0 Consequently, the indispensable element of the protest is the election of the respondent, it being impossible to assume that the protestant will contest his own election.\u00a0 A protest is based upon the injury which the protestant has received or which he is alleged to have received\u00a0 during the course of the election.\u00a0 The only possible way of proving that injury is to establish the election of his adversary.\u00a0 How, then, can the protestant know that his adversary was elected?\u00a0 Since that fact is fundamental and indispensable to a proper protest he must allege it in his protest and prove it upon the trial.\u00a0 How can he do this?<br\/><br\/>Under the Election Law primarily the only evidence of the election of a member of the Assembly or a provincial officer is the certificate of election issued to him by the provincial board of canvassers following its proclamation of the election based on the recanvass provided for in said section 25.\u00a0 That certificate, or the proclamation on which it is based, is the credential, and the only credential, which permits a person to take his seat as a member of the Assembly or which will permit him to assume a provincial office.\u00a0 Without it no one can take office as a member of the Assembly or draw the salary connected therewith.\u00a0 Without it no one can take a provincial office, discharge the duties, or receive the emoluments thereof.\u00a0 The incumbent of a provincial office has no authority to turn the office over to one who does not present such certificate.\u00a0 On the contrary, he must hold the office\u00a0 until his successor presents himself armed with that credential.<br\/><br\/>The protestant may be <i>morally<\/i> certain that the respondent was elected.\u00a0 After the election he may have visited every precinct in the province and personally seen the statements filed by the various boards of inspectors.\u00a0 By the mere process of addition he may have determined to his own satisfaction that his adversary received a majority of the votes allowed arid counted by the boards of inspectors.\u00a0 But it must be remembered that courts are governed not by what the protestant <i>knows<\/i> but by the evidence which the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">law required<\/span>.\u00a0 No person can take a seat in the Assembly or asume a provincial office on account of what a protestant or anyone else may know.\u00a0 Such offices can be assumed only by persons who present the\u00a0 kind of proof <i>required by law<\/i>.\u00a0 The statements of the various boards of inspectors of the province might possibly, under special conditions, be received as evidence of the\u00a0 election of respondent, but it would be of a tertiary character and would be admissible, if at all, only upon the showing that the evidence required by the law, namely, the certificate or the proclamation of the board of canvassers, could not be obtained and that secondary evidence of their contents could not be presented.\u00a0 Even then, it is extremely doubtful if such statements could be accepted.<br\/><br\/>We, therefore, see that the protestant must not only <i>morally<\/i> know that respondent was elected, but he must <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">legally<\/span> know it\u2014that is to say, he must know it in such a way that he can communicate that knowledge effectively to the court.\u00a0 The court must be satisfied from the allegations of the protest that there has been an election and that the respondent was elected.\u00a0 The allegation that the addition of certain figures found in the statements of the boards of inspectors of the various precincts of the province shows that the respondent received more votes than the protestant means nothing to the court.\u00a0 It gives the court not a single legal fact upon which it can predicate any sort of finding with respect to the election.\u00a0 The only fact upon which the election of an individual can be predicated is the certificate or the proclamation of the provincial board of canvassers.\u00a0 That is the only thing that can convey to the court the legal fact of an election; and that is the very fact the respondent does not know and cannot allege prior to the action of the provincial board of canvassers.\u00a0 When the law requires a certain fact to be proved in a certain specified way no one can legally know that fact until he has the evidence required by law to demonstrate its existence.\u00a0 One who cannot prove a fact as the law requires does not know it so far as the law is concerned.<br\/><br\/>It is clear, then, that, prior to the action of the provincial board of canvassers required by section 25, neither the protestant nor the respondent himself can know, legally speaking, who was elected.<br\/><br\/>2.\u00a0 Even if the protestant\u00a0 is morally certain who was elected, can he prove it?<br\/><br\/>This question has already.been answered in substance.\u00a0 The only\u00a0 evidence of the election of the respondent which a court can receive would be the certificate of election issued by the provincial board of canvassers following its proclamation or the proclamation itself.\u00a0 Until that is produced the court cannot act.\u00a0 It has nothing to act upon; there is nothing before it.\u00a0 The statements of the various boards of inspectors mean nothing.\u00a0 They are not, under the law, proof or even evidence of the election of the respondent.\u00a0 Therefore, until the\u00a0 provincial, board of canvassers has performed its duty under the law the protestant cannot prove the first and fundamental fact of his protest, namely, that he lost the election.<br\/><br\/>Finally, under this subdivision, we call attention to the fact that the Election Law nowhere authorizes the court to bring before it the statements of the boards of inspectors of the various precincts of the province.\u00a0 We repeat, in this connection, that we must bear always in mind the imperative necessity of alleging and proving the election of the respondent, that is, the loss of the election by\u00a0 the protestant.\u00a0 Now, prior to the action of the provincial board of canvassers, the only possible way of proving the election of the respondent, not the protestant, is by the statements of the boards of inspectors of the various precincts filed in accordance with section 24 of the Election Law.\u00a0 Apart from the action of the provincial board of canvassers, his election is shown, as the usual expression goes, \"on the face of the returns.\"\u00a0 In other words, he won according to the figures contained in the statements of the various boards of inspectors.\u00a0 The different bases upon which the election of the respondent and the election of the protestant rest must be clearly noted.\u00a0 While the election of the respondent rests <i>solely upon the returns<\/i>, the election of the protestant, if he is elected, depends upon a <i>recount of the ballots<\/i>.\u00a0 This distinction is fundamental and is recognized clearly in the Election Law.\u00a0 It is in the light of this distinction that we are able to conclude that the proof of the election of the respondent, apart from the action of the provincial board of canvassers, was not contemplated by the framers of the Election Law, because the court is not authorized by that law to bring before, it the statements of the inspectors\u00a0 of the various' precincts.\u00a0 The Act provides that the court, on the filing of a protest, \"shall forthwith cause the <i>registry list<\/i> and all <i>ballots<\/i> used at such election to be brought before it and examined.\"\u00a0 No mention is made of the statements of the boards of inspectors.\u00a0 This is significant.\u00a0 If it had been at all contemplated that the election of a respondent could be proved in any other way than by the certificate or proclamation of the provincial board of canvassers, certainly\u00a0 the court would have been expressly authorized by that law to bring before it such statements, as they would, in such case, constitute the only evidence of such election.\u00a0 The Legislature clearly intended that the court should accept as the only evidence of election the certificate or the proclamation of the provincial board of canvassers, and that that would be conclusive so far as the returns were concerned.\u00a0 If the Legislature had intended that the court should declare the election of the respondent upon the face of the returns and in complete independence of the action of the provincial board of canvassers, it would probably have authorized the court to bring before it the only evidence upon which the court could base such a finding.\u00a0 It is no sufficient reply that such express authorization would be unnecessary, as the court has inherent power to bring before it any evidence pertinent to pending inquiries.\u00a0 The same may be said of the registry list and ballots, yet they are expressly mentioned in the law.\u00a0 Besides, it may be doubted that such plenary power exists in the court.\u00a0 The statute seems to restrict the functions of the court to the examination of the ballots and registry list and to such competent and material evidence as refers to them.\u00a0 There may have been a purpose in this.\u00a0 If the statements of the boards of inspectors can be presented by one party, they may be attacked by the other.\u00a0 In such cage there would follow a result that would, if valid, seriously affect the action of the provincial board of canvassers and complicate the election machinery.\u00a0 However, upon the existence of the power referred to we express no opinion.\u00a0 What\u00a0 seems to us clear is that the court cannot find as a fact the election of the respondent on evidence apart from and independent of the action of the provincial board of canvassers.<br\/><br\/>3.\u00a0 It is apparent from what has been said and from a general view of the whole scheme of the Election Law that the beginning of a protest takes for granted the election of some other person than the protestant.\u00a0 It was not intended that the court should have anything to do with that question.\u00a0 That is conceded before the protest starts.\u00a0 It was assumed that such election would come to the court entirely resolved beforehand by officers belonging to another branch of the Government and that there would never be any occasion for a contest concerning it\u00a0 or any necessity of a finding relating to it, and especially no occasion for a trial at which conflicting evidence relating to it would be introduced.\u00a0 It was never contemplated that the court should have anything to do with the <i>returns<\/i>.\u00a0 They are left by the law in the custody\u00a0 of another branch of the Government, are subject to its exclusive orders and commands, and have nothing whatever to do with an election contest.\u00a0 It cannot be assumed that the resolution of the same and identical question was left by the Legislature to two different bodies belonging to different departments of the Government, differently constituted, proceeding according to different methods, and exercising wholly different functions\u2014the one acting almost mechanically, very largely ministerially, permitting no appearances, hearing no evidence, having no discussions, making no decisions; the other acting judicially, with a full trial, permitting appearances, evidence, and discussion, and rendering decisions upon disputed questions of fact and of law.\u00a0 The election of a person other than the protestant, <i>upon the face of the returns,<\/i> is regarded by the Election Law as an inviolable and an untouchable fact in an election protest, to be accepted by the court from the hands of the provincial board of canvassers absolutely without question.\u00a0 The acceptance of that fact is the sole cause of the protest, is the sole\u00a0 basis for an examination and recount of the ballots, and is the sole reason for a judgments favor of the protestant.<br\/><br\/>We conclude, then, that the court in an election contest has no power or authority to find or declare the election of a respondent on the statements of the boards of inspectors of the various precincts, or on any other evidence except the proclamation or certificate of the provincial board of canvassers.\u00a0 Even the finding on this evidence is not so much a finding of the fact of the election as it is the acceptance of a fact already found.\u00a0 It is rather the recognition of the existence of a thing already determined than the finding of the thing itself.<br\/><br\/>This being so, how can it be asserted that an election contest can be maintained prior to the action of the provincial board of canvassers, or that the court can render any judgment in a contest so begun and so maintained?<br\/><br\/>Moreover, the only act which a court is authorized to perform as the final and concluding act of the contest is \"to issue a mandamus directed to the board of canvassers to correct its canvass in accordance with the facts as found.\"\u00a0 (Section 27, Election Law, as amended by Act No. 2170.)\u00a0 From this it is clear that the court has no power to declare the election of anybody, even in its final judgment rendered after a complete trial of all the issues.\u00a0 Much less, then, has it authority to declare, upon the face of the returns merely, the\u00a0 election of the respondent as the basis and fundamental fact of the contest and the one absolutely indispensable to its inception and maintenance.\u00a0 It may establish the facts upon which the provincial board of canvassers will later reproclaim the election, but it cannot declare the election itself.\u00a0 In this connection it must be noted that even that which the court is authorized to do as the crowning act of the contest, namely, issue its mandamus to the provincial board of canvassers, is based upon a <i>recount of the ballots<\/i> and has nothing whatever to do with the statements of the municipal boards of inspectors.\u00a0 The last act of the court, as well as the first, in no way touches the statements of the inspectors of the precincts and they are in no way used by the court as a basis for any of its acts or decrees.\u00a0 That being the case, upon what theory may it be maintained that the statements of the various boards of inspectors of the precinct may be introduced to prove the election of the respondent?\u00a0 The court has no authority to declare anyone elected even after trial.\u00a0 Its power is exhausted with the issuance of the mandamus.<br\/><br\/>It may be argued that the election on the face of the returns of a person other than the protestant will always be conceded and evidence establishing it will never be required.\u00a0 In reply it may be said, in the first place, that it is not quite true that the election of a given person will <i>always<\/i> be conceded so far as the face of the returns is concerned.\u00a0 Occasions will certainly come in which there will arise a contest as to that matter.\u00a0 Where\u00a0 one alleges a fact which is absolutely necessary for his success, it may be taken as assured that some time or other his adversary will deny that fact and stoutly contest its existence.\u00a0 Moreover, such an argument overlooks the essential feature of the whole matter under discussion.\u00a0 Such a concession would be insufficient in law to establish the fact sought to be conceded.\u00a0 A concession made before the meeting of the provincial board of canvassers could rest upon nothing more for its basis than the statements of the various municipal boards of inspectors would show, but, as we have seen, the very question at issue is whether the court can receive such statements as evidence of the election of a given person, and whether they are sufficient evidence thereof even if received.\u00a0 If such statements are not admissible to prove an election, then a concession based upon such statements is inadmissible and ineffective.\u00a0 The public has an interest in an election and as to who is elected.\u00a0 Its rights cannot be affected\u00a0 by the concessions of private individuals.\u00a0 The law provides the only way in which the election of a person can be proved.\u00a0 No concession among contestants for an office will be permitted to\u00a0 circumvent that provision.\u00a0 A concession relating to the election of a person to a provincial office must be based on the action of the provincial board of canvassers.\u00a0 Such concession can do nothing more than concede that the provincial board of canvassers proclaimed\u00a0 the person elected and issued its corresponding certificate to him.<br\/><br\/>There is another view of the matter:\u00a0 If the Court of First Instance is permitted, in an election contest, to declare the election of the respondent upon evidence apart from the action of the provincial board of canvassers, then there immediately arises opportunity for conflicts between the two bodies.\u00a0 The court declares the respondent elected on the face of the returns.\u00a0 Thereafter the provincial board of canvassers meets and declares the protestant elected on the face of the returns.\u00a0 Which will prevail?\u00a0 But the question naturally comes in reply, the election\u00a0 on the face of the returns being purely a mathematical calculation made from the statements of the various municipal boards of inspectors, how could the court and the\u00a0 provincial board of canvassers differ?\u00a0 Laying aside the matter of errors which may and\u00a0 frequently do occur in gathering, aggregating, tabulating, calculating and presenting such statements, we must not forget that the two bodies which deal with those statements are, as we have seen, altogether different in their constitution and are provided with altogether different functions.\u00a0 The court, when the statements are presented to it as evidence, may, perhaps, not only\u00a0 perform the mathematical calculations required, but may also go\u00a0 behind the statements and determine all questions relating to their validity, such as whether they are genuine, whether they are forged, whether they are changed after filing, whether the persons signing were authorized, and a number of other questions.\u00a0 The provincial board of canvassers can do only part, if any, of these things.\u00a0 On the other hand the provincial board of canvassers has authority to return the statements for correction in form.\u00a0 The court has no such authority.\u00a0 The court acts judicially; the provincial board of canvassers, ministerially.\u00a0 Bodies with such widely different powers and functions are certain to come into conflict where they are required to resolve the same question; and this is especially so when the one can receive evidence and decide, while the other can do neither.<br\/><br\/>Again, and merely as a straw.\u00a0 Conflicts may arise as to the possession of the statements referred to.\u00a0 Both bodies may demand possession at the same time.<br\/><br\/>Further touching the lack of power in the court independently to declare the election of anyone in an election contest, let us consider the results which, if the power were conceded, would normally follow its exercise.\u00a0 Let us suppose that, upon an examination of the statements of the municipal boards of inspectors, the court finds that the <i>protestant<\/i> received a majority of the votes cast for that office.\u00a0 Can the court declare him elected?\u00a0 And would that decree be binding upon the provincial board of canvassers?\u00a0 Would that decree admit the successful\u00a0 contestant to a provincial office?\u00a0 Or let us suppose that, upon the same evidence, namely, the statements of the municipal boards of inspectors, the court finds that the respondent was elected as alleged in the protest; and thereupon the protestant, having acquired further information, or for some other reason, concedes in open court the election of the respondent and joins with the latter in a request that he be duly declared elected by the\u00a0 court.\u00a0 Can the court make such\u00a0 a declaration?\u00a0 And, if made, does it bind the provincial board of canvassers?\u00a0 Would that decree be a sufficient credential to admit the respondent to the office of member of the Assembly or to permit him to assume a provincial office?<br\/><br\/>In addition, remembering that the court is authorized by the Election Law to do nothing more than issue a mandamus to the provincial board of canvassers, how can it render an effective judgment or issue an effective mandamus prior to the action of the board to which the mandamus must be directed?\u00a0 The mandamus is only to <i>correct the canvass<\/i>. The canvass cannot be corrected until it exists.\u00a0 Prior to its meeting the provincial board of canvassers cannot be ordered to correct its canvass because it has not yet made any.<br\/><br\/>Finally, there is at least one province in the Archipelago in which the means of communication between the different parts thereof are so inadequate that it would be impossible for any candidate for a provincial office to determine, during the two weeks within which the protest must be filed, who received the majority of the votes.\u00a0 In fact, in such province the provincial board of canvassers is unable to collect from the various precincts of the province the statements of the municipal boards of inspectors until some days,\u00a0 or even weeks, after the time when the law requires them to meet and recanvass the statements.\u00a0 If the period of two weeks were to be counted from election day, that period would expire before it could be determined who had received the majority of the votes cast in the province.\u00a0 In order to protect himself, therefore, each candidate would be obliged to file a protest in anticipation of what possibly might appear when the statements of the municipal\u00a0 boards of inspectors were examined.\u00a0 It is clear that the law did not contemplate this and does not require it.<br\/><br\/>An election is not complete until the results thereof have been proclaimed in the manner required by law.\u00a0 Until that moment the election of a particular person cannot be proved in any court.\u00a0 The proclamation of the provincial board of canvassers is a necessary part of the election.\u00a0 It is the last act thereof.\u00a0 The\u00a0 popular will has not been entirely expressed until it has been\u00a0 proclaimed by that board.\u00a0 We do not hesitate, therefore, to hold that the word \"election\" includes every step necessary to make\u00a0 that election complete and that the time within which a protest must be filed should be counted from the last act in the process of the election which makes that election complete.\u00a0 This being so, and we not believing that the Legislature asks men to perform impossibilities or that it enacts legislation which leads to absurdities, we find and declare that question 1 should be answered affirmatively.<br\/><br\/>Question 2:\u00a0 Did the court err in permitting the intervention of Mariano Melendres?<br\/><br\/>We experience no difficulty with this question.\u00a0 The Election Law\u00a0 provides that an election contest \"shall be upon motion with notice of not to exceed twenty days to all candidates voted for.\"\u00a0 Melendres was duly notified.\u00a0 Upon the service of that notice he at once became a party to the proceeding with all the rights which pertained to any other party.\u00a0 His application for intervention was unnecessary.\u00a0 Being already a party he could exercise any right, present any affirmative demand, allege any kind of a defense which any other party to the contest could present or allege.<br\/><br\/>Question 3:\u00a0 Did the court err in opening the ballot boxes without further proof than the allegations of the protest?<br\/><br\/>We think not.\u00a0 The allegations of the protest are made under oath;\u00a0 they set out in detail the irregularities complained of.\u00a0 These allegations, if true, lay a sufficient foundation for the recount.\u00a0 This is especially the case in view of the wording of the statute.\u00a0 It provides that, upon filing the protest, the \"court shall forthwith cause the registry list and all ballots used at such election to be brought before it and examined.\"<br\/><br\/>While the statute seems to require <i>all<\/i> ballots to be brought before the court, the practice should be, in the first instance, to bring before the court <i>for examination<\/i> only such ballots as are questioned by the protest.<br\/><br\/>Question 4:\u00a0 Did the court err in refusing the request of respondent Sevilla that it examine the ballots in the precinct of Taguig?<br\/><br\/>Again we think not.\u00a0 The respondent Sevilla alleged irregularities in this precinct.\u00a0 The protestant denied the allegation.\u00a0 Evidence was introduced by the contending parties touching the issue.\u00a0 Upon\u00a0 that evidence the court found that the alleged irregularities had not been proved and refused to examine the ballots cast therein.\u00a0 A careful examination of the evidence fails to disclose error in the ruling.<br\/><br\/>Question 5:\u00a0 Should an illiterate or other voter, who, through physical disability, is unable to cast his ballot without assistance, be perniitted to vote without first taking oath to his illiteracy or disability?<br\/><br\/>He should not.\u00a0 The provision of the Election Law relative to this matter is as follows (sec. 22):<br\/><blockquote>\"A voter otherwise qualified who declares that he cannot write, or\u00a0 that from blindness or other physical disability he is unable to prepare his ballot, may make an oath to the effect that he is so disabled and the nature of his disability and that he desires one or two of the inspectors named by him to assist him in the preparation of such ballots.\u00a0 The board shall keep a record of all such oaths taken which shall show the name or names of the inspector or inspectors assisting the voter and file the same with the municipal secretary with the other records of the board after the election.\u00a0 The inspector or inspectors so named as aforesaid shall retire with the voter and prepare his ballot according to his wishes.\u00a0 The information thus obtained shall be regarded as a privileged communication.\"<\/blockquote>Under these provisions the oath of illiteracy or disability is a\u00a0 condition precedent to the right to vote.\u00a0 To permit voters to receive assistance in casting their ballots without any evidence as to their disability would be to open the door somewhat to fraud, coercion, and intimidation and to remove to some extent the\u00a0 secrecy of the ballot.\u00a0 This cannot be permitted, and to that end the oath must be taken before the elector may be allowed to cast his ballot.<br\/><br\/>Question. 6:\u00a0 Did the court err in declaring null and void the election in the precinct of Jalajala?<br\/><br\/>It did not.\u00a0 The Election Law provides for the greatest secrecy in\u00a0 casting the ballot and at the same time the greatest publicity\u2014secrecy as to the contents of the particular ballot cast, but\u00a0 publicity as to the manner of preparing and casting it.\u00a0 Full publicity as to everything that transpires from the time the voter enters the polling place until he goes out of it, except, of course, as to the contents of the ballot he casts, is the strongest influence going to protect him against undue influence, imposition, coercion, intimidation, and fraudulent practices in the exercise of his franchise.\u00a0 It cannot be permitted that publicity be abridged in the slightest degree.\u00a0 In the precinct in question the law was violated in many ways:\u00a0 (1) The registry lists were improperly prepared and signed; (2) not enough voting booths were prepared and furnished; there should\u00a0 be a booth for every 50 voters and one for a fractional part thereof; (3) the ballot boxes were not presented to the public for inspection prior to the opening of the polls as required\u00a0 by law; (4) no person, aside from the election officials, was permitted inside the polling place except the person engaged in casting his ballot; (5) voters were not permitted freely to approach and enter the polling place or witness the balloting as required by law; (6) voters and the public generally were prohibited from\u00a0 approaching the polling place or entering the same; (7) voters desiring to vote were not permitted to approach or enter the polling place except in alphabetical order, and then only singly and as called by the policemen guarding the entrance; (8) the entrance to the polling place was guarded by officers of the law under instructions from the election officials to permit no one to enter except those designated by such officials; (9) the election was carried on as follows:\u00a0 The chairman of the board\u00a0 of inspectors called the name of a voter; the name was taken up by the policemen guarding the door and repeated to the body of electors which was kept waiting thirty meters from the polling place; the voter whose name was called, if present, thereupon stepped forward and was permitted to enter the polling place and vote; after he retired another name was called and the process repeated.<br\/><br\/>This manner of conducting an election cannot be tolerated.\u00a0 The law should be carefully studied by the election officials and strictly complied with.\u00a0 While courts always hesitate before declaring an election absolutely void, as it results in disfranchising innocent voters, we feel bound, under the facts in this case, to so declare.<br\/><br\/>We affirm the finding of the trial court upon all of the ballots except the following:<br\/><br\/>Precinct of San Mateo: Exhibit No. 66, Sevilla, was counted in favor of Mariano Melendres.\u00a0 We think this was error.\u00a0 The name found upon the ballot is not sufficiently like that of Mariano Melendres to warrant its being counted in his favor.<br\/><br\/>Second precinct of Malabon:\u00a0 Exhibit 39, Sevilla, where the name of Catalino Sevilla is found in the space allotted to the candidate for member of the Assembly.\u00a0 This ballot ought not to have been counted for Sevilla for provincial governor.<br\/><br\/>Precinct of Morong: Exhibit 42, Sevilla; this exhibit is composed of two ballots.\u00a0 One of them is rejected for the same reason as the last exhibit, namely, that the name of Catalino Sevilla occupies the space alloted to the candidate for member of the Assembly.\u00a0 It cannot be counted.<br\/><br\/>Precinct of Pasay:\u00a0 Exhibit No. 48, Sevilla; this ballot must be rejected for the same reason.<br\/><br\/>Precinct of Pililla:\u00a0 Exhibit No. 59, Sevilla, must be rejected on the ground that the name found upon the ballot is not sufficiently like the name of Catalino Sevilla to warrant its being counted in his favor.<br\/><br\/>Second precinct of Caloocan: Exhibit No. 34, Sevilla, must be rejected, as there is a distinguishing mark upon the back of the ballot which was not shown to have been placed there either before or after the voting occurred.<br\/><br\/>Precinct of Para\u00f1aque:\u00a0 Exhibit No. 20, Melendres, must be counted in favor of Sevilla.\u00a0 The marks made upon the ballot were made\u00a0 accidentally.\u00a0 They are not identifying marks.<br\/><br\/>Second\u00a0 precinct of Pasig:\u00a0 Exhibit No. 36, Manalo, was improperly rejected by the court.\u00a0 The ballot should be counted.<br\/><br\/>Precinct of Tanay:\u00a0 In Exhibit No. 42, Manalo, one ballot was improperly rejected.\u00a0 The name in the space alloted to candidate for the office of provincial governor is that of Mamerto Manalo, while the name in the space allotted to candidate for member of the Assembly is not the name of Mamerto Manalo, although\u00a0 somewhat similar to it; so that there exists no confusion as to whether the voter intended to vote for Mamerto Manalo for provincial governor or member of the Assembly.<br\/><br\/>First precinct of Caloocan:\u00a0 Exhibit No. 6 was improperly admitted in favor of Mamerto Manalo, inasmuch as the name actually voted is so much different from that of candidate Manalo that it is impossible to say for whom the voter intended to cast his ballot.\u00a0\u00a0 The ballot should\u00a0 have been rejected.<br\/><br\/>Second precinct of Pasig:\u00a0 For the same reason Exhibit No. 35, Manalo, must be rejected.<br\/><br\/>First precinct of Pasay:\u00a0 Exhibit No. 38, Manalo, must also be rejected for the same reason.<br\/><br\/>Precinct of San Mateo:\u00a0 Exhibit No 39, Manalo, must be rejected for the same reason.<br\/><br\/>Precinct of Para\u00f1aque: Exhibit No. 48, Manalo, must be rejected as a vote for Manalo for provincial governor on the ground that his name appears solely in the space allotted to the candidate for member of the Assembly.<br\/><br\/>First precinct of Pateros: Exhibit No. 39, Melendres, consisting of 8 votes in favor of Mamerto Manalo, must be rejected on the ground that each one contains a distinguishing or identifying mark on the back thereof; and it does not satisfactorily appear that these marks were made before or after the ballot was voted.<br\/><br\/>Precinct of Mariquina:\u00a0 Exhibit No. 16, Melendres, should have been counted in his favor for the reason that the inversion of the names was not sufficient to require its rejection.<br\/><br\/>Precinct of Binarigonan:\u00a0 One of the ballots in Exhibit No. 2, Melendres, should have been counted in his favor, the marking of two of the spaces in blank not having been intended as a distinguishing or identifying mark.<br\/><br\/>First precinct of Caloocan:\u00a0 Exhibit No. 6, Melendres, must be rejected on the ground that the name written in the space allotted to the candidate for provincial governor is not sufficiently like the name of Mariano Melendres to warrant us in finding that the voter intended to vote for him.<br\/><br\/>Second precinct of Malabon; For the same reason Exhibit No. 14, Melendres, must be rejected.<br\/><br\/>Precinct of San Mateo:\u00a0 Exhibit No. 44, consisting of one ballot, should be rejected for the same reason.<br\/><br\/>Precinct of Taytay;\u00a0 Exhibit No. 46, Melendres, must be rejected on the ground that the name of Mariano Melendres is written in the space allotted to candidate for member of the Assembly.<br\/><br\/>Precinct of Taytay:\u00a0 Exhibit No. 47, Melendres, must be rejected for the same reason given for the rejection of Exhibit No. 6.<br\/><br\/>Precinct of Montalban: one of the ballots composing Exhibit No. 17, Melendres, must be rejected on the ground that the name of Mariano Melendres is found in the space allotted to candidate for member of the Assembly.\u00a0 It cannot, therefore, be counted as having been voted for the office of provincial governor.<br\/><br\/>Precinct of Mariquina:\u00a0 Exhibit No. 70, Sevilla, a ballot counted in favor of Melendres, must be rejected for the same reason.<br\/><br\/>We find that all of the ballots written with lead pencil or with ink and otherwise free from defect should be counted.\u00a0 Of these, 40 were cast in favor of Sevilla and only 2 were allowed him by the court; 17 were cast for Manalo and none were allowed him by the court; 42\u00a0 were cast for Melendres and only 18 allowed him by the court.<br\/><br\/>In all particulars not hereinabove specifically stated otherwise the judgment of the court below is affirmed.<br\/><br\/>Making the proper computations from the data heretofore given we find and decide that, at the election held in the Province of Rizal on the 4th day of June, 1912, Sevilla received 1,876\u00a0 votes, Manalo 1,877, and Melendres 1,881.\u00a0 We therefore find and adjudge that Mariano Melendres received a larger number of votes than any other candidate for provincial governor at said election.<br\/><br\/>The cause is returned to the Court of First Instance of Rizal, with instructions to issue its mandamus to the provincial board of canvassers to correct its canvass in accordance with the facts as\u00a0 found by the Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres<\/i> and\u00a0 <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>.,\u00a0 concur.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"CENTER\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>DISSENTING IN PART AND CONCURRING IN PART<\/i><br\/><\/div><br\/><b>JOHNSON, J.,<\/b><br\/><br\/>I cannot agree with my associates with reference to the interpretation of the Election Law relating to the time when the protest must be presented.\u00a0 In my opinion the word \"election\" used in the Election Law relates to the day on which the election is held and not to the final promulgation or announcement of the result of said election.\u00a0 Practically every section of the law contains proof that the word \"election\" refers to the day on which the election is held.\u00a0 (<i>See<\/i> secs. 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, and 30 of Act No. 1582, and secs. 1, 4, 8, and 12 of Act No. 2045, as well as the sections of the other amendments which have been made.)<br\/><br\/>I find no reason for giving the word \"election\" in section 27 a different meaning from the very evident meaning which said word has in every other section of the Election Law.\u00a0 If the protest cannot be made until after the provincial board has proclaimed the result of the election and has issued the certificate of election to the successful candidates, then the protest in the present case was premature and should have been so declared.\u00a0 Under the theory of the majority decision the protest was made before any cause of protest had arisen.\u00a0 Even the protestant did not know but that the provincial board might declare that he was elected, until after the result of the election had been promulgated by the provincial\u00a0 board.\u00a0 The protest is the beginning of the action.\u00a0 An action begun before the cause\u00a0 accrues will be dismissed.\u00a0 This is true in both civil and criminal cases.\u00a0 The defect of commencing an action before the same accrues or matures cannot be cured by amendment.\u00a0 The error can only be cured by commencing an entirely new action, by filing a new complaint, by the presentation of a new protest.<br\/><br\/>The majority opinion holds that the protest should have been made within two weeks after the proclamation of the provincial board.\u00a0 It was actually made within two weeks after the \"election,\"\u00a0 In my opinion it was made within the time prescribed by law.\u00a0 In my opinion the discussion relating to the time of the protest was unnecessary and foreign to the real question presented by the protestee.<br\/><br\/>Seldom have I seen so much strength exercised in an effort to give a borrowed meaning to a law which is perfectly plain and easy to understand.<br\/><br\/>The question relating to the time when the protest must be presented was not raised nor discussed in the case of Navarro <i>vs<\/i>. Veloso, and in my opinion the discussion is not necessary for the decision in the present\u00a0 case.\u00a0 The long and forceful argument\u00a0 sustaining the contention that the protest should be filed two weeks after the result of the election is proclaimed is not supported by a single authority, even though the authorities are numerous upon the question and all to the contrary.\u00a0 The law is not a new law.\u00a0 It is patterned after the laws of many of the States of the United States.\u00a0 Many\u00a0 of its provisions are exactly analogous to similar laws in many of the States.\u00a0 Provisions similar to those contained in section 27 have been construed many times by the courts of last resort in many States of the Union.<br\/><br\/>I cannot secure the consent of my mind to conform to the interpretation given by the majority opinion to the phrase \"within two weeks after the election\" as found in section 27 of Act No. 1582, and as amended by Act No. 2170.\u00a0 In all other respects I agree with the facts and the conclusions of the majority opinion.<\/div>",

appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo dismissing a complaint filed in a separate action incident to the proceedings had in connection with the administration of the estate of Gualberto Galve, deceased, wherein plaintiffs and appellants sought to establish and recover a claim against the estate.<br\/><br\/>Juana Villanueva et al., plaintiffs and appellants, will be referred to hereinafter as the claimants, and Hugo Chavez, administrator of the estate of Gualberto Galve, deceased, defendant and appellee, will be referred to as the administrator.<br\/><br\/>Hugo Chavez was appointed as the administrator of the estate of Gualberto Galve, deceased, on the 17th of September, 1910.\u00a0 On the 13th of the following October he entered upon the discharge of his official duties.\u00a0 A committee was\u00a0 duly appointed to appraise the assets of the estate and to hear and pass upon claims.\u00a0 The claimants, as the heirs of one Lucio Villanueva, deceased, presented to the committee on the 31st day of December, 1910, a claim amounting to some P5,575.80.\u00a0 This claim was allowed by the committee, but the administrator being then and there present gave notice of appeal to the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 This notice was incorporated in the report of the committee, which was filed on the 1st day of June, 1911.\u00a0 On July 5, 1911, counsel for the administrator filed a formal notice of appeal setting forth therein that they had just been apprised of the filing of the report of the committee.\u00a0 On July 8 claimants submitted their formal objections to the allowance of the appeal on the ground that it had not been presented within the period prescribed by law.\u00a0 Upon due consideration the Court of First Instance held that the notice of appeal filed at the time when the committee admitted the claim, which was duly incorporated in their report, was a sufficient compliance with the statutory provisions in this regard, and thereupon on the 8th day of July directed the claimants to file a complaint against the administrator and thus bring the question at issue to trial as in any other ordinary action.\u00a0 To this order claimants excepted, and again on the 15th day of July the court directed that a civil action be instituted.\u00a0 On the 24th day of July claimants submitted a bill of exceptions to the trial court which the court refused to certify.\u00a0 Claimants then applied for a writ of mandamus to the Supreme Court to compel the trial judge to certify the bill of exceptions.\u00a0 The application for the writ was denied by the Supreme Court on August 12, 1911.\u00a0 On the 24th day of October the administrator reported to the Court of First Instances that he was ready to make distribution of the estate, and the court thereupon directed that he proceed to the distribution, and at the same time entered an order disallowing the claim of these claimants on the ground of their failure to prosecute the same to final judgment in accordance with the repeated order of the court.\u00a0 It appears that the claimants had no notice as to the action of the court in\u00a0 this regard, and that they were not advised that an application would be made by the administrator for an order of distribution on the 24th day of October.\u00a0 On the 28th of October, four days after the entry of the order directing the administrator to proceed with the distribution and disallowing the claimants' claim, claimants filed their complaint against the administrator for the amount of their claim.\u00a0 Two days thereafter, on the 30th day of October, the administrator was duly notified of the filing of this complaint.\u00a0 Four days thereafter, on the 4th of November, without notice to claimant and in his absence, the administrator presented his accounts and receipts to the Court of First Instance, and on his motion his accounts and the receipts covering the distribution of the estate were accepted and approved, and an order entered discharging the administrator.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the opinion of the trial judge that he had no notice of the filing of the complaint at the time when he approved and allowed the administrator's accounts and the report of his proceedings under the order for distribution and it is clear that the administrator, although he had due notice four days prior to the date of the order discharging him, did not advise the court of that fact at the time when he procured the issuance: of the order of discharge.<br\/><br\/>The administrator filed his answer to claimants' complaint on the 20th of November, setting forth that he was no longer the administrator of the estate of Gualberto Galve, deceased, that his accounts had been settled and distribution made under the order of the court, and that he had been finally discharged and was without legal capacity to defend the action.\u00a0 Claimants contended that he was in fact the administrator at the time of the filing of the suit, that he had notice thereof prior to the time when he procured the order for his discharge.\u00a0 Claimants further alleged that the administrator had fraudulently concealed this knowledge from the court; that at the time of the filing of the suit the proceeds of the estate had not yet been distributed; and that they had no knowledge of the settling of the administrator's accounts, until they were advised of it by his pleading filed on the 20th of November, setting forth those facts.\u00a0 Claimants' allegations as to lack of notice are not controverted in the record and must therefore be taken to be true.\u00a0 The case was heard upon the pleadings and the court entered an order dismissing the complaint upon the following grounds:\u00a0 (1) Because final distribution was ordered on the 24th day\u00a0 of October, four days before it was filed, and on the same day the claim had been disallowed by the court because of claimants' failure to file their complaint in compliance with the court's order.\u00a0 (2) Because all of the estate having been distributed under an order issued four days prior to the filing of the\u00a0 suit, no property remained in the hands of the administrator.\u00a0 This appeal was perfected from the order dismissing the complaint.<br\/><br\/>For the proper disposition of this case it becomes necessary for us to review the action of the trial judge: (1) In declaring claimants' action abandoned on the 28th day of October.\u00a0 (It may be well here to call attention to the fact that the perfection of the appeal from the allowance of the claim by the commissioners was substantially equivalent to the institution of a separate action\u00a0 in the Court of First Instance, incidental to the administration proceedings, which action, under the statute, was to be conducted in like manner as ordinary actions filed in that court, upon a complaint and other pleadings, to be filed thereafter.\u00a0 (2) In disallowing their claim on the same day.\u00a0 (3) In issuing the order directing the distribution of the estate.\u00a0 (4) In discharging the administrator on the 4th day of November. (5) In dismissing claimants' complaint.<br\/><br\/>Various questions might be raised as to the procedure whereby these issues have been brought before us for review, but since such questions have not been raised by the parties themselves, we shall limit ourselves strictly to a review of the proceedings of the court below, in so far as such review may be necessary for the proper disposition\u00a0 of this appeal.<br\/><br\/>As to\u00a0 the action of the court below in declaring claimants' right of action abandoned on the 28th day of October, we are all agreed that it cannot be sustained.\u00a0 His ground for so doing was the failure of claimants to prosecute their action by filing their complaint in accordance with his directions.\u00a0 No date was fixed within which the complaint was required to be submitted, and the court's repeated orders directing the filing of the complaint must therefore be understood as directions to file the complaint within a reasonable time.\u00a0 Of course, the time occupied in a bona fide attempt to procure relief from these orders in this court should not have been counted against the claimants.\u00a0 It appears, then, that the neglect of claimants to file their complaint, on which the trial judge based his action, took place between the time when they were notified of the action of this court denying their application for the writ of mandamus on August 12,1911, and the 24th of October, 1911, which could not have been much more than two months.\u00a0 We are not prepared to say that under no circumstances would the lapse of such a period of time justify a court in treating an action, such as that in the case at bar, as abandoned.\u00a0 But under all the circumstances of this case, we think that the trial court was not justified in arriving at that conclusion.\u00a0 A very substantial amount was involved, P5,575.80.\u00a0 The amount had been allowed as a just claim by the committee to which it had been submitted.\u00a0 The claimants had asserted their rights with the utmost vigor in the trial court, and had even gone so far as to institute mandamus proceedings in support of their contentions.\u00a0 A scant two months had elapsed from the time when they received notice of the dismissal by this court of their application for the mandamus to the date when their right of action was declared to be abandoned,in the court below, and the claim disallowed.\u00a0 No notice was served upon them by the administrator when he submitted his account for settlement and procured\u00a0 the order for distribution of the estate; and their contention that they had no actual knowledge of the court's action in disallowing their claim, and ordering distribution of the estate, is not controverted.\u00a0 Some of the members of this court, of whom the writer of this opinion is one, would prefer to base our ruling in this regard strictly upon the failure to serve due notice upon the claimants as to the time when the question of the declaration of abandonment was to be submitted for adjudication, being of opinion that the order was absolutely void for lack of such notice; but some of the other members of the court prefer to limit themselves to a declaration that under all the circumstances of this case, the trial judge erred in declaring claimants' action\u00a0 abandoned.<br\/><br\/>Manifestly, if the declaration of the abandonment of claimants' action was erroneous, so also was the disallowance of their claim; and in so far as they were affected thereby, so also was the issuance of the order of distribution of thee state and the<br\/><br\/>The only question which remains to be determined is whether the action against the administrator for the recovery of the claim against the estate may be prosecuted against him to judgment, where it appears that he has procured the erroneous dismissal of the action, the erroneous disallowance of the claim, and the issuance of orders for the distribution of the estate and for his own discharge which are erroneous in so far as the claimants are affected thereby.\u00a0 We think there can be no doubt that claimants, under these circumstances, are entitled to proceed with their action against the administrator, and that the order directing the dismissal of their complaint must be reversed.\u00a0 The supreme court of Mississippi, in discussing the rights of creditors to recover from the estates of deceased\u00a0 debtors, under the Mississippi statutes, says that:\u00a0 \"It is only after the payment of all existing debts due from the estate and not barred by the statute of limitations, or upon their payment being properly secured as provided by law, that the administrator, may lawfully proceed to the distribution of the estate.\"\u00a0 (Pollock, Admr., <i>vs<\/i>. Buie et al., 43 Miss., 140, 156; sees. 739, 742, 753, 754, Philippine Code of Civil Procedure.) The reasoning upon which the Mississippi court arrived at its conclusion would seem to be not less forceful in this jurisdiction than in that, as will readily appear from the following extracts from the opinion in the case just cited.<br\/><blockquote>\"When is it that an executor or administrator may make a full settlement of the administration?\u00a0 The statute answers, when the estate has been fully administered by the payment of all the debts.\u00a0 When is it, that upon final settlement, the court shall order the executor or administrator to make immediate distribution\u00a0 of all the property in his hands?\u00a0 The answer is, when the estate has been fully administered by the payment of all the debts.\u00a0 It is not to be presumed that whilst the claims of creditors, the primary objects of the trust, remain unsatisfied, the court would order an immediate distribution of all the property in the representative's hands among the secondary objects of the trust, the legatees and distributees.\u00a0 It is not in the power of the court to discharge an executor or administrator until the trusts are fully executed, except in the case of removal or resignation, when <i>administration de bonis<\/i> non shall be granted as in case of the death of the executor or administrator, and with like effect on all the proceedings by or against the executor or administrator.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"From this view of the law, it will clearly appear that while there are valid and subsisting debts against the estate, the executor or administrator cannot be legally discharged from the trust of his administration, except by death, resignation, or removal; and upon the happening of either of these events, it is provided that administration <i>de bonis<\/i> non shall be granted.\u00a0\u00a0 This keeps the doors to the estate open, so that the creditors may have an opportunity to collect their claims against it.\u00a0 But if, as is insisted, the settle1ment of an estate, purporting to be final, precluded existing creditors from instituting suits against the executor or administrator for the collection of valid and subsisting claims against the estate, great wrong and injustice would be the result, and the primary purpose, object, and policy of the law, in granting administration upon estates of decedents, would be\u00a0 defeated.\u00a0 To hold the estate liable, not withstanding such settlement, would, in our opinion, accord with the spirit and policy of the law, and subserve the ends of justice, and it would constitute no hardship upon the executor or administrator, as by a faithful discharge of his duties he would have it in his power to wind up and\u00a0 completely finish the administration of a solvent estate, within a reasonable time, by giving the proper notice to creditors to present their claims within the time prescribed by the law, and all claims against the estate, of which he had no notice, within the time limited by the law, after publication of such notice, would be barred, and could no longer be regarded\u00a0 as valid and subsisting debts\u00a0 against the estate. And the law thus being complied with, the executor or administrator, after paying all the debts of which he had any knowledge within the time limited by the statute, could safely make a final settlement of the estate, and a distribution thereof among the legatees or distributees.\u00a0 But to hold that a settlement, purporting to be a final settlement of an estate, made without a compliance with the requisitions of the law, would be conclusive upon creditors would put them completely at the mercy of the\u00a0 executor and administrator and the legatees and distributees.\"\u00a0 Pollock, Admr., <i>vs<\/i>.

The court erred in not finding in the accused's favor the exemption from responsibility provided in section 3 of General Orders, No. 68.<br\/><br\/>\"II. The court erred in declaring in its judgment that more than six years had not elapsed from October 14, 1904, to November 4, 1911.\"<\/blockquote>With reference to the first assignment of error, it may be said\u00a0 that section 3 of General Orders, No. 68, provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"A subsequent marriage contracted by any person during the life of the former husband or wife of such person, with any person other than such former husband or wife, is illegal and void from the beginning, unless:<br\/><br\/>\"1. The former marriage has been annulled or dissolved; and<br\/><br\/>\"2. Unless such former husband or wife was absent and not known to\u00a0 such person to be living for the\u00a0 space of seven successive years immediately preceding such subsequent marriage, or was generally reputed and was believed by such person to be dead, at the time such subsequent marriage was contracted; in either of which\u00a0 cases the subsequent marriage is valid, until its nullity is adjudged by a competent tribunal.\"<\/blockquote>The evidence shows that the defendant was a <i>practicante<\/i> in the Philippine Constabulary at the time of the second marriage; that on the 14th day of May, 1904, he was legally married to one Juliana Rodriguez; that on the 4th day of November, 1911, he was married to Agustina Ramos.\u00a0 The evidence further shows that about six months after his first marriage (in the month of October or November, 1904) he and his first wife separated; that he went to the Province of Benguet and worked on the Benguet wagon road, and continued in the Province of Benguet until the month of October, 1910; that he did not hear from his first wife while he was in the Province of Benguet; that he wrote to his parents, who lived in the pueblo of Pozorrubio, concerning the whereabouts of his wife and that they <i>answered him that she had left their house about two months after he and his wife had separated <\/i>(or in the month of December, 1904, or January, 1905).<br\/><br\/>The defendant came to Manila and was employed in the Bureau of Navigation in the month of October, 1910.\u00a0 He says that he made frequent inquiries concerning the whereabouts of his wife and that he was not able to secure any information concerning her.\u00a0 After leaving the employment of the Bureau of Navigation, he became a <i>practicante<\/i> in the Philippine Constabulary and was located in the Province of Batangas at the time he met his second wife, whom he married on the 4th day of November, 1911.<br\/><br\/>While the defendant testified that he had made inquiries concerning the whereabouts of his wife, he fails to state of whom he made such inquiries.\u00a0 He did not even write to the parents of his first wife, who lived in the Province of Pampanga, for the purpose of securing information concerning her or her whereabouts.\u00a0 He admits that he had a suspicion only that his first wife was dead.\u00a0 He admits that the only basis of his suspicion was the fact that she had been absent.\u00a0 That she was not dead was proven by the fact that she appeared as a witness in the trial against him.\u00a0 It does not appear from the record, from the investigation which he made concerning the existence of his first wife, that he had any fact or facts upon which he could, <i>in good faith<\/i>, base the belief that she was dead.\u00a0 She testified that some time after the defendant left her at Pozorrubio, in the month of October or November, 1904, she came to the city of Manila, in order to secure a livelihood, and that, except for the times she visited in the Provinces of Pampanga and Tarlac, she remained in the city of Manila thereafter.\u00a0 The fact that he failed to make inquiry of the parents of his first wife concerning her whereabouts fully justifies, in our opinion, the conclusion of the lower court that he had\u00a0 not\u00a0 reached the conclusion that his first wife was dead, <i>after a proper investigation, in good faith<\/i>.\u00a0 He also testified that on one occasion he had been told that his wife was in the Provinces of Pampanga or Tarlac.\u00a0 It will be remembered that he left his wife; she did not leave him until after he had been absent for a period of more than six months.<br\/><br\/>We said in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Juan San Luis (10 Phil.

Counting then from the month of December, 1904, until the 4th of November, 1911,\u00a0 the time of the second marriage, it will be seen that seven successive years immediately preceding said marriage had not elapsed.<\/li><\/ol>We believe that what has been said with reference to the first assignment of error answers also the second.<br\/><br\/>The Attorney-General, in a carefully prepared brief, recommends that the sentence of the lower court be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>After a careful examination of the evidence, we find that the same shows, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged in the complaint.\u00a0 The sentence of the lower court is therefore hereby affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C J., Torres, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><b>MORELAND, J.:<\/b><br\/><br\/>I concur in the result.<\/div>",

Roscom, accusing him of the crime of attempted homipide.\u00a0 Upon said complaint the said Roscom was duly arrested.\u00a0 Upon, arraignment, he plead not guilty.\u00a0\u00a0 The justice of the peace conducted the <i>preliminary examination<\/i>, at the close of which\u00a0 he found that there was probable cause for believing that the said Jerry N. Roscom was guilty of the crime charged in said complaint and held him for trial in the Court of First Instance of said province.<br\/><br\/>On the 3d of September, 1912, the acting prosecuting attorney of the Moro Province, James R. Marlott, presented a complaint against the said Jerry\u00a0 N. Roscom, accusing him of attempted homicide.\u00a0 The cause was duly brought on for trial, at the close of which the Honorable Charles A. Low found that the evidence was insufficient to show that the defendant Roscom was guilty of the crime charged and dismissed the complaint against him\u00a0 and discharged him from the custody of the law, with costs <i>de oficio<\/i>.\u00a0 In the same sentence the judge directed the said prosecuting attorney to present a complaint against Casimiro del Campo and his son, Jose del Campo, charging them with the crime of false accusation.\u00a0 Later the said prosecuting attorney, James R. Marlott, presented a complaint against the said Casimiro del Campo and Jose del Campo, accusing them of the crime of false\u00a0 accusation.\u00a0 The defendants were duly\u00a0 arrested and tried.\u00a0 After hearing the evidence, the Honorable Charles A. Low found the defendants guilty of the crime charged in the complaint and sentenced each of them to be imprisoned for a period of two years four months and one day of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, and each to pay one-half the costs.\u00a0 From that sentence the defendants appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>While the appellants in this court do not make any specific assignments of error in their brief, they present a very interesting argument and discussion of both the facts and the law applicable to the present case, and attempt to show that the record of the lower court does not justify the conclusions of fact nor the sentence imposed by the lower court.\u00a0 The Attorney-General, in a very short brief, submits the case to this Court \"without argument or recommendation.\"<br\/><br\/>During the trial of the present cause in the lower court the entire record in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Jerry N, Roscom was presented in evidence without objection.\u00a0 It will be remembered that the order of the judge directing that a complaint be presented against the present defendants for false accusation, was based upon the facts as they were developed in that cause.\u00a0 In view of the fact that the record in the case of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Roscom was introduced in evidence during the trial of the present case, we have a right to examine that record for the purpose of ascertaining the basis of the order of the lower court with respect to these defendants.\u00a0 During the trial of that cause but three witnesses were examined and they were all presented by the prosecution.\u00a0 They were Casimiro del Campo, Jose del Campo, and a woman called Balandia.\u00a0 Jose del Campo testified that in the month of June, 1912, he was going from La Union\u00a0 to Putaquiton, in a banca or \"vinta de vela,\" in Davao Bay; that there was with him in the banca a woman called\u00a0 Balandia and one Rafael; that when he was passing a point called Mantuka he saw the said Jerry N. Roscom riding a horse along the beach; that the said Roscom whistled for him, swinging a handkerchief in the air, indicating that he (Roscom) desired him to come ashore; that he did go near the shore; that the said Roscom immediately commenced to abuse him by using abusive and insulting language, as well as to abuse his father, Casimiro; that he then started to sail away from the beach and that the defendant Roscom immediately fired four shots with his revolver at him and his companions; that later he reported what had occurred to his father, Casimiro del Campo.\u00a0 These declarations of Jose del Campo are substantially and in many details supported by the declarations of the witness Balandia.<br\/><br\/>Casimiro del Campo, the father of Jose\u00a0 del Campo, declared as a witness and said that while he knew nothing of what actually occurred, as related\u00a0 by his son, Jose del Campo, he believed that what his son had told him in relation to what had actually taken place, was true, and that he filed the complaint before the justice of the peace, basing the same upon the information which he had received from his son.<br\/><br\/>The defendant presented no proof whatever.\u00a0 In view of the fact that the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution was riot even contradicted, it is difficult to understand upon what theory the\u00a0 defendant\u00a0 was absolved.\u00a0 It must have been upon the theory that the witnesses for the prosecution, in the opinion of the judge, failed to state the truth.<br\/><br\/>During the trial of the present cause (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Casimiro del Campo et al.) a number of witnesses were sworn both for the prosecution and for the defense.\u00a0 The prosecution attempted to show by the declarations of Jerry N. Roscom and others, that he had not fired four shots at Jose del Campo at the time and place mentioned in the complaint against him, as was shown in the trial of the cause against him.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Roscom.) The prosecution also presented some other witnesses who claimed that they were on the beach at the time and place where Jerry N. Roscom called or whistled or waved his handkerchief to Jose del Campo and his companions, and tried to induce the latter to come ashore, in the month of June.\u00a0 They say that Jerry N. Roscom fired no shots at Jose del Campo and his companions.\u00a0 Jose del Campo and Balandia\u00a0 again declared as witnesses and stated positively, giving the circumstances, that at the time Jerry N. Roscom fired the four shots at them there were no other persons on the beach with him.<br\/><br\/>In addition to this fact the defense tried to show that the said Jerry\u00a0 N. Roscom was living with Flora, the daughter of Casimiro del Campo and sister of Jose del Campo, as his \"querida,\" and that that fact had caused difficulty between the said Roscom and the Del Campp family.\u00a0 Casimiro testified that he had\u00a0 presented the complaint\u00a0 before the justice of the peace upon information given himby his son and after he had consulted with the governor of the province (p. 64).\u00a0 He declared that he had presented the complaint in good faith and without any malice whatever, believing that his son had told him the exact truth.<br\/><br\/>Under the foregoing facts, were the defendants guilty of the crime of false accusation?\u00a0 In the first place it is not shown by the record nor by the declarations of any of the witnesses that the defendant Jose del Campo presented any charge, false or otherwise, to \"any executive or judicial officer, whose duty it is to investigate or punish.\"\u00a0 That fact would\u00a0 seem to be sufficient to\u00a0 dispose of the present case as to him.\u00a0\u00a0 As to the defendant, Casimiro del Campo, he frankly admitted that he presented the complaint before the justice of the peace, relying wholly upon the statements made to him by his son and the advice given to him by the governor of the\u00a0 province.\u00a0 Accepting the conclusions of the lower court in the case of United States <i>vs.<\/i> Roscom, we must conclude that the facts adduced during the trial of that cause were not sufficient to show that Jerry N. Roscom was guilty of the crime charged in the complaint presented by the acting fiscal in the Court of First Instance of the District of Davao.\u00a0 Even though the evidence was not sufficient to show that Roscom had committed the crime charged against him, is that fact sufficient to justify a conviction of Casimiro del Campo of the crime of false accusation?\u00a0 Article 326 of the Penal Code provides that the crime of false accusation or complaint is committed by any person who <i>falsely charges<\/i> another with acts which, if committed, would constitute an offense upon which a prosecution might be instituted by the Government on its own motion, if such charges be made to any executive or judicial officer, whose duty it is to investigate or punish such felony.\u00a0 We believe that in addition to the fact that the accusation is false, it must appear that the accuser knew that it was false at the time the same was presented.\u00a0 It is not sufficient to sustain a complaint of false accusation to show simply that the proof was not sufficient to convict the accused.\u00a0 That rule would subject every complainant to the possibility of a complaint for false accusation.\u00a0 We believe that it must be shown that the accuser \"falsely charged\" another with an offense upon which a prosecution might be instituted.\u00a0 That is to say, that the accuser knew or had good reason to believe that the accusation at the time it was presented contained false charges.\u00a0 Many complaints are presented charging another with an offense, etc., and finally, after trial, it is shown to the satisfaction of the courts, that all of the charges in\u00a0 the complaint were in fact false, as they were applied to the particular defendant.\u00a0 That\u00a0 fact, however, is not sufficient of itself to condemn the accuser.\u00a0 In our opinion it must be shown that the accuser knew that such accusations were false or had good reason to believe that they were false, at the time they were made.\u00a0 It not being made to appear, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants knew that the accusation or complaint which they had presented was false, we are of the opinion that the sentence of the lower court should be, and it is hereby reversed, with costs <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de oficio.<\/span><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The trademark consists of two concentric circles having the words <em>Ginebra de Tres Campanas<\/em>, and the plaintiff's name between them, and in the center a device of three bells (tres campanas) connected at the top by a ribbon and some ears grain, with the words <em>Extra Superior<\/em> under the mouth of the bells. The plaintiff's autograph is reproduced across the middle of the circular space and the bells. More detail is unnecessary; but it may be mentioned that the plaintiff claims title under a grant from the Governor-General dated December 16, 1898, and that the mark covered by the alleged grant had underneath the circles the word Amberes (Antwerp), indicating imported gin, while that now used has Manila in the same place, and is applied to gin made in the Philippines.<p><\/p>\u00a0 <p>It may be assumed that the defendant's design has a deceptive resemblance to the plaintiff's notwithstanding a change from <em>Tres Campanas to Dos Campanas<\/em>, and the substitution of the defendant's autograph for the plaintiff's. And whether, the plaintiff has a title to the mark now used or not, it also may be assumed that he might recover under the Philippine Act of March 6, 1903, No. 666, section 4, Compiled Acts, p. 180, section 58, but for the following facts, on which the defendant had judgment in both courts below.<\/p><p>The plaintiff's trademark in its turn closely imitates in most particulars a much earlier and widely known trademark of Van Den Bergh &amp; Company of Antwerp. It is true that in the latter there is but one bell, and that the title correspondingly is <em>Ginebra de la Campana<\/em>, but the intent to get the benefit of the Van Den Bergh device is too obvious to be doubted. We do not go into the particulars of the different registrations, etc., of this latter, beginning with a Spanish certificate to the Antwerp firm in 1873. For although the plaintiff elaborately argues that under the Spanish <em>regime<\/em> trademark rights could be acquired only by statutory registered grant; that Van Den Bergh &amp; Company never acquired any such rights in the Philippines; that if they did they lost them by failing to register or lapse of time; and that he was free to get a registered title as against any certificate of theirs\u2014those questions are immaterial in this case. With or without right, the earlier trademark was in widespread use and well known, and the obvious intent and necessary effect of imitating it was to steal some of the good will attaching to it and to defraud the public. The courts below found the fraud and that both plaintiff's and defendant's marks were nothing more than variations upon the earlier mark.<\/p><p>In such a case the Philippine act denies the plaintiff's right to recover. (Act No. 666, section 9. See section 12, and No. 744, section 4. Compiled Acts, sections 63, 66.) It is said that to apply the rule there laid down would be giving a retrospective effect to section 9 as against the alleged Spanish grant of December 16, 1898, to the plain\u00adtiff, contrary to general principles of interpretation and to article 13 of the treaty of Paris, April 11, 1899 (30 Stat. at L., 1760), providing that the rights of property secured by copyrights and patents shall continue to be respected. But the treaty, if applicable, cannot be supposed to have been intended to contravene the principle of section 9, which only codifies common morality and fairness. The section is not retrospective in any sense, for it introduces no new rule. (See Manhattan Medicine Co. vs. Wood, 108 U. S., 218, 27 L. ed., 706; 2 Sup. Ct. Rep., 436.) Imposition on the public is not a ground on which the plaintiff can come into court, but it is a very good ground for keeping him out of it. Even if Van Den Bergh &amp; Company had no registered title and no such other rights under Spanish colonial law as they have under Act No. 666, section 4, the imposition on the public was still there, and though not a matter of which the defendant could complain, it was a matter to which he could refer when the plaintiff sought to exclude him from doing just what the plaintiff had done himself. This certainly would have been our law, and we should assume, if material, that the same doctrine would have prevailed in Spain, in the absence of the clearest proof to the contrary, which we do not find in the record or the brief.<\/p><p>What we have said with reference to the plaintiff's claim under the treaty applies in substance to his argument that, by section 14 of Act No. 666, the Spanish certificate is conclusive evidence of the plaintiff's title. That section must be taken to be subject to general principles of law embodied in other sections to which we have referred.<\/p><p>If there was any claim intended to be put forward on the ground of unfair competition, the prayers of the complaint and the plaintiff's testimony show that such claim depended fundamentally on the alleged infringement of trademark. Any matters, of fact in dispute were sufficiently disposed of by the concurrent findings of the courts below.<\/p><p>Judgment affirmed.<br\/><\/p><p><\/p><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>226 U.

I., the said Cornelia Ballesteros did willfully, unlawfully and criminally slaughter and cause to be slaughtered for public consumption a carabao, without having previously obtained due permission from the municipal treasurer.\"<br\/><br\/>The appellant, while admitting the slaughter of the animal in violation of section 33 of Act No. 1147, contends that she should not be held criminally responsible therefor, because, as she alleges, one Bernabe Aquino, the councilman for her barrio, had promised her that he would get a permit, and because she had authorized Aquino to have the animal slaughtered, relying on that promise.\u00a0 Aquino flatly contradicted her in so far as she claimed that he had promised to secure a permit, and swore that in answer to his inquiry before the animal was killed, she said that she had the necessary permit.<br\/><br\/>The testimony was so conflicting that the trial judge was unable to make a finding as to just what did in fact take place between Aquino and the defendant.\u00a0 He evidently did not believe that either one or the other had told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth as to their connection with the unauthorized slaughter of the carabao.<br\/><br\/>After a careful review of all the evidence we are forced to agree with the trial judge.\u00a0 We are inclined to believe that both Aquino\u00a0 and the defendant participated. in the illegal slaughter of the animal, well knowing that the required license had not been issued; we think that their conflicting testimony in this regard was the result of an attempt on the part of each of them to throw the blame upon the other's shoulders.<br\/><br\/>But however this may be, we are of opinion and so hold, that the defendant failed to establish her claim in the court below, that she ordered the animal slaughtered with the understanding, made in good faith, that Aquino would secure the necessary permit before it was killed.\u00a0 She claims that she gave Aquino one leg of the animal on the understanding that he would get the permit and have it slaughtered ; but we are satisfied that although she well knew that the slaughter of the animal without a permit was unlawful, she made no effort, in good faith, to secure the necessary permit.\u00a0 We are strongly inclined to believe that if she did in fact give one leg of the animal to Aquino, it was in consideration of his services in slaughtering it, and with the understanding that he, as councilman, would hold her harmless in the event that any question should arise as to the lack of a permit.\u00a0 Certain it is that she ordered the animal slaughtered, well knowing that she had no permit; that she made not the slightest effort to satisfy herself that a permit would be or was in fact issued before the animal was slaughtered in compliance with her orders; that when the carcass was delivered to her she made not the slightest effort to ascertain whether the law had been complied with in this regard; and that her conduct as disclosed by all the evidence of record justifies us in concluding that she made no such effort at compliance with the law as would justify us in holding that there was no criminal intent in her violation of its\u00a0 provisions.<br\/><br\/>When the unlawful acts charged against an accused are established by competent evidence, criminal intent may be and will be presumed, unless such intent is rebutted by the introduction of evidence sufficient to overcome this presumption and satisfactorily disclosing the absence of such criminal intent.\u00a0 (U.

S. <i>vs<\/i>. Comis, 7 Phil. Rep., 332.)<br\/><br\/>The defendant and appellant insists that the checks had no value and that inasmuch as the penalty for the crime of larceny is based upon the value of the thing stolen, no penalty can be imposed upon him.\u00a0 This contention of the appellant is not tenable.\u00a0 The checks\u00a0 were checks of the Philippine Government, payable to the said Mr. Hawley.\u00a0 The face value of the checks was P515.44.\u00a0 In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Tan Jenjua (1 Phil.

Jose C. Abreu, judge, held that the land in litigation occupied by the defendant belongs to the plaintiffs and must be restored to them and ordered him to deliver to them possession thereof, without special finding as to damages, for their amount was not shown, at the trial, and without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/>On January 4, 1911, Aquilina Arcenas and Demetrio Arcenas filed a complaint against Estanislao Laserna, alleging as ground of action that they are the owners of a parcel of land on Calle Legazpi, pueblo of Capiz, of 24 ares and 60 centares, bounded on the north by the land of Felix Arcangeles, Moises de los Reyes, and Soledad Amancio; on the east by the cross street now called P. Gomez and the land of Ramona Laserna; on the south by Calle Legaspi; and on the west by the land of Eugenio Ramos, Clemente Alba, Paulino Imcon, and Mauricio Andrada; which land they had acquired by purchase from Josefa Jabar in September, 1910; that illegally and maliciously and by the uss of violence the defendant Laserna had on December 14, 1910, seized and fenced in a part of said land, approximately 207 square meters in area, on the side bordering on the cross street P. Gomez, with 5.85 meters on the side toward the south or Calle Legaspi; 21.20 meters toward the east or cross street P. Gomez; 15.13 meters on the north and 9 meters on the west; that the plaintiffs have been unable to use the land detained by the defendant and have been thereby damaged to the extent of P100; and therefore judgment is prayed in their favor against the defendant, sentencing him to return to them the land occupied by him of approximately 207 square meters, to pay them P100 damages, and to pay the costs of the suit.<br\/><br\/>In his answer, the defendant denied each and all of the allegations in the complaint, except those hereinafter admitted; acknowledged that he has surrounded the land described with a fence, as it belongs exclusively to him; and further alleged that the land to which the complaint refers is his absolute property and that he has been so holding it for over ten years, without reckoning the possession of his predecessors from time immemorial; and prayed for judgment in his favor, with the costs against the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>After a hearing on May 6, 1911, and examination of the evidence adduced by both parties with the documents they submitted at the trial, exhibition of a plan and the testimony of a licensed surveyor, the court as a result thereof, on May 22, 1911, rendered the judgment in question.\u00a0 Defendant excepted thereto and asked in writing for a new trial on the ground that said judgment was contrary to the law and the evidence adduced at the trial.\u00a0 This motion was denied by order of May 23, whereupon defendant excepted and presented the proper bill of exceptions, which was approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs attempt through an action for recovery exercised by them to have returned by the defendant the parcel of land of 207 square meters that belongs to them on property usurped by him.<br\/><br\/>Denying the allegations set forth in the complaint, the defendant alleged that the land in question is his exclusive property and he has been in possession thereof for over ten years as owner, without reckoning the possession his predecessors enjoyed from time immemorial, and to this effect he exhibited in proof of his right Exhibits 1 and 2.\u00a0 The first is a copy of a possessory information relative to a lot which Casiana Alvarez had acquired by extrajudicial purchase on August 28, 1894, from\u00a0 Ambrosia Amisola Vidal for P150 which building lot he and his predecessors\u00a0 had possessed quietly and peacefully from time immemorial.\u00a0 It is free from encumbrance, measures 207 square meters, is bounded on the north by the lot of Matea Alvarez, on the east by a cross street, on the south by Calle Legaspi, and on the west by the lot and house of Ramona Laserna\u00a0 and Matea Alvarez.\u00a0 As the petitioner lacked a recorded title proving his ownership he entered in accordance with the Mortgage Law an oral information for the possession of said estate with summons of the adjacent landowners and a hearing before the public prosecutor, asking that in case of approval he be issued the original record for inscription thereof in the property registry, in which record it appears that Matea Alvarez and Ramona Laserna were cited as the owners of the adjacent lands.\u00a0 After the hearing before the public prosecutor the Court of First Instance by order of April 23, 1895, approved said information without prejudice to the better right of a third party and ordered the inscription requested in the property registry.\u00a0 At the bottom of the record of said proceedings is a signed and sealed certificate by the registrar of property that he had compared the copy literally and found it to agree with the original record filed in the registry of Capiz on July 27, 1897.<br\/><br\/>Exhibit 2.is a receipt\u00a0 issued in Capiz on February 24, 1896, by the same registrar, stating that Estanislao Laserna, the verbally authorized agent of Casiana Alvarez, had paid the sum of P87 inscription fees, as recorded in entry No. 292, volume 3 of the memorandum journal, fees paid in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>Defendant alleged that he had inherited the land in question from\u00a0 his mother, Casiana Alvarez, who is the party that secured the aforesaid possessory information.\u00a0 The hereditary right he demonstrates and sufficiently proved at the trial is admitted\u00a0 and does not seem to be contradicted by the plaintiffs, wherefore it is unquestionable that Estanislao Laserna is the lawful owner of the lot in question as the son of Casiana Alvarez and successor in the right she had over said lot, a right proved by said record of possessory information and by the testimony of several witnesses, among whom are the two sons of the original owner of the tract, Ambrosia Amisola, from whom defendant's predecessor in interest acquired it.<br\/><br\/>In opposition to defendant's said possessory certificate the plaintiffs in turn have exhibited as evidence of their right to the lot in litigation Exhibits A and B, the latter of which is a composition title issued to Matea Alvarez y Rubio by the <i>Direccion\u00a0 General de Administracion Civil<\/i> on May 25,1891, for a parcel of 24 ares and 63 centares, bounded on the north by land of Felix Arcangeles, Moises de los Reyes, and Soledad Amancio; on the east by a cross street and Ramona Laserna; on the south by\u00a0 Calle Legazpi; and on the west by lands of Eugenio Ramos, Clemente\u00a0 Alba, and Mauricio Andrada; which title appears inscribed in the property registry of Capiz on March 14, 1892.<br\/><br\/>Exhibit A is a notarial instrument setting forth the sale made by Josefa Jabar y Navarra on September 26, 1910, of a lot and wooden house thereon with an iron roof and a stone wall which she acquired from the administrator of the intestate estate of Matea Alvarez, situate in the barrio of Ilaut, Calle Legaspi, pueblo of Capiz, of 24 ares and 70 centares in area, and bounded on the north by Calle Urdaneta, now Burgos, and the lot of Pastor Alcazar; an the east by the unnamed street that crosses Calle Legazpi and the lots of Moises de los Reyes, Soledad Amancio, and the deceased Ramona Laserna; on the south by Calle Legazpi and on the west by the lots of Eugenio Ramos, Clemente Alba, Paulino fricoy, and Mauricio Andrada, for the sum of P2,650 received from the purchasers who remain absolute owners of said lot and house free from all encumbrance, the vendor Jabar having ratified it before a notary on December 27, 1910.<br\/><br\/>The question is reduced to whether the lot under consideration is or is not included in the composition title and in the instrument of sale exhibited by the plaintiffs under the letters A and B in connection with their plan, Exhibit F.\u00a0 Examining with due attention and weighing together the result and the merits of the evidence adduced by the parties, it appears under the rules of sound judgment that the land or lot in question is not included in the said composition title, nor in the land or lot sold by Josefa Jabar as derived from the intestate succession of Matea Alvarez to the plaintiffs Aquilina and Demetrio Arcenas.<br\/><br\/>Really, if the lot in litigation were included within the boundaries of the land which said composition title covers or of the land sold by Josefa Jabar to the plaintiffs, the southern boundary of the tract would be Calle Legazpi and Ramona Laserna's lot, and it would not have been recorded that the land is bounded on the east by the lot of said Ramona Laserna and the cross street, formerly unnamed and now called P. Gomez, for Ramona Laserna's lot does not border on the cross street P. Gomez and the lot in question does, said lot of Ramona's being between the land of the plaintiffs and that of the defendant and bounded by Calle Legazpi toward the south and not on the east.\u00a0 The surveyor, Agripino C. Albaladejo, avers that by direction of the plaintiffs he\u00a0 did not survey or include in the plan he had made a certain small portion of their land toward the north because it was swampy and useless.<br\/><br\/>The composition title was issued in May, 1891, and registered in March, 1892, while the possessory information entered by Casiana Alvarez was secured in April, 1895, for the land in the shape of a square which is the subject matter of this litigation.\u00a0 Were it true that said portion of land had been included in the parcel obtained from\u00a0 the state by Matea Alvarez, she, who was cited and notified in said information as the owner of land adjacent to the lot which was the subject of that information, and was informed of the proceedings in the matter requested by Casiana Alvarez, would have protested in defense of her rights; but still she did nothing, giving to understand by her inaction and silence that her right were not prejudiced or any of her property usurped.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiffs have offered no evidence in opposition to the possession proven by oral and documentary evidence that the defendant enjoyed over the lot in question, neither the testimony of Josefa Jabar, the former owner of the tract, who did not testify in this suit, nor was the record of proceedings, Exhibit\u00a0 E, which according to the plaintiff mentions the lot in question, forwarded to this court to show that the lot in litigation forms part of the land of the plaintiffs, for since they have not tried to have Josefa Jabar testify in the case or forwarded said record\u00a0 it is because they would not therewith prove their claim.<br\/><br\/>The record of possessory information exhibited in copy as No. 1, the original whereof is filed in the Capiz registry, is genuine and effective; it partakes of the character of a judicial\u00a0 proceeding and of a public document and is duly recorded in the property registry of the Province of Capiz in accordance with article 392 of the old mortgage law, which regulates the manner of recording possessory informations.<br\/><br\/>In the decision in the case of Salacup <i>vs<\/i>. Rambac the principle was laid down that a possessory information title has the same force and effect as all other titles recognized by law, and a possessory information recorded in the registry of property is <i>prima facie<\/i> proof that the possessor of the land to which it relates is the owner thereof.\u00a0 (17 Phil. Rep., 21.)\u00a0 The same principle was laid down in Inchausti &amp; Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Commanding General (6 Phil. Rep., 556); and Baldovino <i>vs<\/i>. Amenos (9 Phil. Rep., 537).<br\/><br\/>According to this principle, applied repeatedly to different cases by this court and now a precedent, the record of possessory information inscribed in the property registry and presented by the defendant in defense of his right is a title sufficiently establishing his ownership in the absence of any other demonstrating a better right to the lot in question.<br\/><br\/>On this supposition it is undeniable that said possessory record constitutes a just title, by virtue of which and of his hereditary right the defendant Estanislao Laserna has been in good faith for over ten years possessing the land in litigation, aside from the possession of his predecessors, and therefore he is reenforced by the right that ownership to the tract has prescribed in accordance with the provisions of article 1940 <i>et seq<\/i>. of the Civil Code, because he acquired it through inheritance as the lawful successor of his mother, who in turn\u00a0 had bought it from its original owner in August, 1894, and he possesses it in the belief that his said mother was the lawful owner of said lot, ownership whereof was legally transmitted to him by operation of law, and the possession he enjoys in said tract is peaceful, public, and as owner, as is proven in the case, and not interrupted either\u00a0 naturally or civilly,\u00a0 wherefore, if necessary, it is proper and just to hold prescription in his favor, were it not positively proven, as the record discloses that the land in question is not included within the boundaries of the land covered by the title and plan presented by the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the judgment appealed from must be reversed and the defendant absolved, as he hereby is, from the claim for recovery presented by the plaintiffs, without special finding as to coats.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

VII. The person solemnizing a marriage must make and sign a certificate showing:<br\/><br\/>\"1. The real and full names of the parties and their places of residence.<br\/><br\/>\"2. Their ages.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The\u00a0 consent of the father, mother, or guardian, or of one having the charge of such person, if any such be given, if the male be under the age of twenty years or the female be under the age of eighteen years.\u00a0 For the purpose of ascertaining these facts, the person solemnizing the marriage is authorized to examine parties and witnesses on oath and receive affidavits, and he must state such facts in his certificate.\u00a0 The marriage shall not be performed in case of nonage, unless the consent hereinbefore required shall be personally given by the parent or guardian or person having charge of the infant, or certified in writing over his or her signature, attested by two or more subscribing witnesses and proved by the oath of one of them.\"<\/blockquote>There is no penalty in the General Orders attached to the solemnization of a marriage between persons under age.\u00a0 The prosecution must be sustained, therefore, if at all, under the Penal Code in connection with said General Orders.<br\/><br\/>Article 479 of the Penal Code reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 479. Any ecclesiastical or civil authority who shall perform or authorize the ceremony in any marriage prohibited by law, or barred by an impediment not capable of dispensation, shall suffer the penalties of suspension in its medium and maximum degrees and a fine of not less than 625 and not more than 6,250 <i>pesetas<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"If the impediment shall be subject to dispensation, the penalty shall be <i>destierro<\/i> in its minimum\u00a0 degree and a fine of not less than 325 and\u00a0 not more than 3,250 <i>pesetas<\/i>.\"<\/blockquote>Article 475 of that code reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"ART. 475. Any minor who shall marry without the consent of his or her parents, or other person standing <i>in loco parentis<\/i>, shall suffer the penalty of <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum and medium degrees.<br\/><br\/>\"The offender shall be pardoned as soon as the parents or the persons referred\u00a0 to in the next preceding paragraph shall approve the marriage.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Pe\u00f1alosa (1 Phil. Rep., 109), this court held that \"a minor who marries without parental consent in the false belief that she is of age is not criminally responsible,\" and that, \"it is not criminal negligence for a husband to rely upon his wife's statement of her age nor for the wife to rely upon that of her father.\"\u00a0 In that case the facts relative to the guilt of the husband, who was charged with a violation of article 475 pf the Penal Code in that he had married a woman who at the time of the ceremony was under the age of consent, are stated by the court as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"As for the husband, it has been proved that two days before the marriage was celebrated he received a letter from the woman in which she said that she was 21 years of age.\u00a0 This letter the defendant showed to the clergyman who married them.\u00a0 The woman when the marriage ceremony was performed took an oath before the clergyman, in the presence of her husband, that she was 21 years of age.\u00a0 The defendant testifies that he had no suspicion that the woman was a minor.\u00a0 This statement has not been contradicted and we consider that it suffices to demonstrate that the defendant acted under a mistake of fact, and in conformity with the principle laid down in this opinion he\u00a0 has not been guilty of a violation of article 475 in connection with article 13, No. 3, nor in any other manner.\"<\/blockquote>The principles referred to are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The accused were convicted in the lower court for the violation of this\u00a0 article, it appearing from the evidence adduced that the accused, Marcosa Pe\u00f1alosa, was not 21 years of age on the 3d day of May, 1901, when she married the codefendant, and that she contracted the marriage without the consent of her father.<br\/><br\/>\"Should the judgment appealed from be affirmed if the woman was in fact less than 21 years of age, without taking into consideration what was her belief concerning her age?\u00a0 Many instances can be called to mind in which there may exist an error in good faith concerning this point.\u00a0 A man who is about to marry and is ignorant of his exact age seeks and obtains a certified copy of the registry of his baptism.\u00a0 From this it\u00a0 appears that he was\u00a0 born twenty-one years before the 1st day of June, let us say.\u00a0 He marries on the 15th day of June.\u00a0 It\u00a0 develops later that the person who took the copy of the registry of baptism read July as June, and as a matter of fact the man in question did not complete his twenty-one years until the 1st day of July, fifteen days after his marriage.\u00a0 Can such a one be convicted of a violation of article 475?\u00a0 It would seem that this case is included within those of the article.\u00a0 He was in fact a minor when he married, and\u00a0 he married without the consent\u00a0 of his-parents.\u00a0 If is true that so far as the parent is concerned the offense has been committed, but can the same be said with reference to the State in the absence of a voluntary violation of the law?\u00a0 Article 1 of the Code does not contain the words 'with malice' that are to be found in the Code of 1822; nevertheless Pacheco, the eminent commentator, has said that those words are included in the word 'voluntary' (El Codigo Penal Concordado y Comentado, Vol. I, folio 74, third edition); and he states positively that crime cannot exist without intent.<br\/><br\/>\"Other commentators, without being in entire conformity with Pacheco, nevertheless are agreed up to a certain point.\u00a0 Groizard says: 'Such is the general rule; so it is ordinarily (Codigo Penal de 1870, Vol. I, folio 37.)\u00a0 Viada says that 'in the majority of cases, in the absence of intent there has been no\u00a0 crime; but that there\u00a0 can exist in some cases the latter without the former.'\u00a0 (Vol. I, Codigo Penal Reformado de 1870, folio 16.)\u00a0 Silvela says: 'In effect it suffices to remember the first article, which states that where there is no intent there is no crime,\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 in order to assert without fear of mistake that in our Code the substance of a crime does not exist if there is not a deed, an act which falls within the sphere of ethics, if there is not a moral wrong.'\u00a0 (Vol. 2, Derecho Penal, folio 169.)<br\/><br\/>\"The theory that the absence of the words 'with malice' in the prevailing Code has this effect is supported by the provisions of article 568 which says:\u00a0 'He who by reckless negligence commits an\u00a0 act which would constitute a grave crime if malice were present shall\u00a0 be punished,' etc.<br\/><br\/>\"The supreme court in several successive sentences has followed the same doctrine: 'It is indispensable that this (action) in order to constitute a crime should carry with it all the malice which the volition and intention to cause the evil which may be the object of the said crime suppose.'\u00a0 (Judgment of May 31, 1882.)<br\/><br\/>\"In a cause for falsity the facts involved were that the defendant had married 'before the municipal judge of the pueblo of Rubete without other ceremony than the simple manifestation and expression of his wishes and those of the woman Leonor with whom he married before said municipal judge; that relying upon that, on account of his ignorance and lack of instruction, on the 27th of June, 1882, and the 5th of April, 1884, in the municipal court of the pueblo of Polopos he registered as legitimate children his sons, Jose and Emilio, the offspring of the illicit union of the defendant and Leonor Gonzales.'\u00a0 For the crime of falsity committed by reckless negligence the Criminal Audiencia of Albuiiol condemned the said defendant to the penalty of four months and one day of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>.\u00a0 The Supreme Court annulled said sentence 'considering that whatever might be the civil effects of the registration of his three sons entered by the accused in the Civil and Parochial Registers, it cannot partake of the nature of a crime for lack of the necessary element of volition or intent to offend, essential to every punishable act or omission; neither did he act with negligence.\u00a0 (Judgment of March 16, 1892.)<br\/><br\/>\"In a cause prosecuted against the Chinese\u00a0 Sy-Ticco and against Don Guillermo Partier, in the court of Quiapo, for falsification of trade-marks, the Criminal Chamber of the Audiencia of Manila condemned the Chinaman to two years and some months of <i>presidio correccional,<\/i> and Partier to one year and some months of similar imprisonment.\u00a0 A writ of error was sued out in the name of Partier.\u00a0 The Supreme Court annulled this sentence,\u00a0 'considering that the moral element of the crime, or, in other words, existence or nonexistence of intent and malice in the commission of an act designated and punished by the law as criminal is essentially a question of fact for exclusive judgment and determination of the trial court.' \"'Considering that the act charged against the accused, Guillermo Partkr, of having printed in his lithographic establishmert the trade-mark of the cigarette' packages of the Insular factory by virtue of a supposed order of the owner of said factory, to whose injury the Chinaman Abelardo Zacarias Sy-Ticco ordered him to do the said fraudulent printing, cannot be considered (from the facts\u00a0 declared proved in the final sentence of acquittal of the Court of First Instance, accepted in its entirety and without any addition by the Appellate Court) as constituting intentional participation or cooperation in deed of falsification and defraudation committed by the former, since it does not appear in any part of the sentence that Partier was in connivance with Sy-Ticco nor that he had any reason to suspect the true character of him\u00a0 who, styling himself the representative of Se\u00f1or Santa Marina, the owner of the La Insular factory, gave him the order to print the trade-mark of this factory on the packages, which were to be used to hold cigarettes.'\u00a0 (Judgment of December 30, 1896.)<br\/><br\/>\"The judgment of October 4, 1893, is of the same tenor.\u00a0 It is not necessary to hold in this action that no crime mentioned in the Code can exist without intent.\u00a0 It suffices for the present to decide, as we do decide, that one cannot be convicted under article 475 when by reason of a mistake of fact there does not exist the intention to commit the crime.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of the United\u00a0 States <i>vs<\/i>. De los Reyes (1 Phil. Rep., 375),\u00a0 it was held that \"a woman who marries a second time under a bona fide belief that her former spouse is dead is not guilty of bigamy,\" the court saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"We have recently held, in the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Marcosa Pe\u00f1alosa and Enrique Rodriguez, decided January 27, 1902, that there can be no conviction under article 475 of the Penal Code, where by reason of a mistake of fact the intention to commit the crime does not exist, and we think the same principle must apply to this case.\u00a0 The defendant was therefore properly acquitted of the crime charged in the complaint.\"<\/blockquote>This court having held that neither of the spouses can be convicted for a violation of article 475 if he acted in good faith and without the knowledge that the other was under the age of consent, the question naturally arises whether the person solemnizing the marriage may plead similar good faith in defense to an action brought against him under article 479.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that he may.\u00a0 There presents itself to us no reason why the rule applicable to the persons married should not be alike applicable to the person performing the ceremony which makes them man and wife.\u00a0 It is very easy to deceive an officiating clergyman as to the ages of the persons who present themselves for marriage\u2014much easier than it is to deceive either of the spouses in relation to the same matter.\u00a0 Persons who are sufficiently acquainted with each other to desire marriage are naturally presumed to know the age of each other.\u00a0 If a man desiring to marry a woman may be excused from criminal prosecution upon the ground that he has been deceived and mistaken as to her age, it would seem that the clergyman, who knows neither of the parties and who must of necessity depend upon an independent investigation in order to determine the ages of the parties, would be in a far better position to invoke the protection of the principle than would the husband.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, it is evident from the sections of General Orders, No. 68, above quoted, that it was the intention of the makers of that law to permit the officiating clergy-man or other person solemnizing the marriage to determine the fact of age or nonage upon the testimony of witnesses.\u00a0 To that end he is given the authority to examine on oath the persons who present themselves for marriage and any witnesses which they may produce or which he may desire to call relative to age.\u00a0 Having the right to determine\u00a0 a question upon the testimony of witnesses, it would seem strange indeed that he could be prosecuted criminally for a wrong determination of that question.\u00a0 The mere fact that two persons might differ as to the conclusion which ought to be reached upon a given state of facts or upon the testimony of certain witnesses is not sufficient to justify the conclusion that the one whose conclusion is wrong is guilty of a crime, while he whose judgment is right is innocent.\u00a0 Both have exercised the same qualities, the same functions, and the Same good faith.\u00a0 That the one may be wrong and the other right furnishes no reason for classifying the one as a criminal and the other as an innocent person.<br\/><br\/>There is some evidence in the record tending to show that the clergyman did not act in good faith in determining the question of age, one of the witnesses for the prosecution intimating that the accused was informed by one of the contracting parties that the girl was under eighteen, and that he, instead of refusing thereupon to go forward with the marriage, suggested to her that she declare herself to be eighteen or over and that he would obtain witnesses to substantiate her declaration.\u00a0 We have some difficulty in finding the facts sought to be established by this testimony.\u00a0 The witnesses who testified were those released from prosecution for that purpose. Such testimony, while under proper circumstances entirely acceptable, is at the outset always subject to suspicion and it requires only very little credible evidence to ripen that suspicion into a certainty.\u00a0 That additional evidence is found in this case in the form of written statements made by these witnesses and declared by them under oath to be true.\u00a0 These written statements are those prepared by the accused at the time of the ceremony and presented to the contracting parties and their witnesses for signature.\u00a0 They were\u00a0 duly signed and sworn to by those parties and witnesses.\u00a0 Although the oath is not in the form prescribed by General Orders, No. 68, nevertheless it contains all of the requisites essential to a valid declaration under that Act.<br\/><br\/>It appears in the record that the father of the girl gave his consent to her marriage some few days after the ceremony, and, therefore, under article 475 of the Penal Code, \"pardoned\" the offending parties.\u00a0 It is contended that this consent is retroactive and deprives the acts complained of of all illegality, and that the accused should be acquitted for that reason.\u00a0 We do not find it necessary to decide this question, as there are other grounds upon which the acquittal may be based.\u00a0 Nor do we decide the question whether, in fact, the marriage performed was one \"prohibited by law,\" under article 479 of the Penal Code, above quoted.\u00a0 While this is, of course, a fundamental question and in all reason should be taken up and decided first of all, there having been some difference of opinion on the court on the matter and the decision of the case being plain and unanimous along other lines, we have decided not to dispose of that question at this time.<br\/><br\/>It appearing clear to us that, even though it be admitted that the marriage complained of was illegal and that the subsequent consent of the parent did not relieve the defendant of liability for the part he had taken therein, the accused acted in good faith without criminal intent, and that he made the investigation required by law in a reasonably satisfactory manner, the conviction cannot stand.<br\/><br\/>The judgment is reversed and the accused acquitted of the crime charged.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Jimenez (23 Phil. Rep., 557) was one of <i>quo warranto<\/i>, based on the ground that the decision of the court in the original protest was null and void for the reason that not all of the candidates voted for for that office had been notified of the protest as required by law and that, therefore, the court was without jurisdiction to enter the judgment which it did enter in favor of the defendant.\u00a0 In that case, the record of the court below being before the Supreme Court, the latter in deciding the case said:<br\/><blockquote>\"From that record it appears that the very question of the notice to all of the candidates voted for at said election for the office of municipal president was raised before the court below and fully considered and decided by it.\u00a0 After the entry of the judgment in favor of the defendant, a motion was made by the plaintiff to vacate and set aside said judgment and to\u00a0 dismiss the whole proceeding upon the ground that not all of said candidates had been notified of the protest as required by law.\u00a0 The motion was heard.\u00a0 The question was litigated.\u00a0 The evidence was discussed and considered.\u00a0 The arguments of counsel were presented.\u00a0 The court found from the evidence that all of the candidates had been notified of the protest and that the notice was in the form and served in the manner and within the time required by the statute.\u00a0 That question having been raised before the court below and passed upon there, we are unable to see at this moment how an action of <i>quo warranto<\/i> can be maintained, based upon the theory that such notice was lacking.\u00a0 That question having been determined in the court below, and the decision never having been questioned in the only manner in which such a decision can be, we must hold it conclusive in this action, <i>quo warranto<\/i> not being a method by which that decision can be reviewed.\u00a0 We are, therefore, of the opinion that the action must be dismissed.\"<\/blockquote>On a motion for rehearing we said:\u00a0 \"We have to say in amplification of our former opinion on this question, that the general rule is that, where the jurisdiction of the court depends upon the existence of facts, and the court judicially considers and adjudicates the question of its jurisdiction, and decides that the facts exist which are necessary to give it jurisdiction of the case, the finding is conclusive and cannot be controverted in a collateral proceeding.\"<br\/><br\/>While this case is not strictly in point in the resolution of the question\u00a0 presented by counsel for the petitioners, nevertheless, it touches a theory which has, in our judgment, a strong bearing on the decision of that question.\u00a0 The question whether all of the candidates were served with notice being one of fact, it should have been presented to the trial court for its consideration and determination.\u00a0 That court was in a better position to determine that question than is this court.\u00a0 The resolution of that question might require the taking of testimony and would certainly\u00a0 require the determination of a question of fact.\u00a0 If the question had been determined by the trial court, its determination, under the case above cited, would have been final, at least in the sense that it\u00a0 would not be subjected to collateral attack.\u00a0 It is our opinion that that question cannot be raised for the first time in this court, and we must decline, therefore, to consider it.<br\/><br\/>Where the jurisdiction of a trial court depends upon a question of law alone, as it usually does, the same rule would not apply.\u00a0 We\u00a0 have held on several occasions that the question of the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter can be raised at any time in any court where the lack of jurisdiction appears on the face of the record, as is almost invariably the case, but, as is clear; the jurisdiction of a court over the subject matter is in such case a question of law and involves in its determination no\u00a0 question of fact.\u00a0 Where, however, as here, the jurisdiction of the court depends upon a question of fact, it must be first raised in that court and therein determined.<br\/><br\/>The first objection raised by counsel to the jurisdiction of the court is therefore overruled.<br\/><br\/>The second objection presented by the petitioners is that:<br\/><blockquote>\"Even assuming the court did have jurisdiction, the judgment rendered is void because the court confined its investigation to what occurred in the first precinct and examined and counted the ballots of that precinct only, notwithstanding contestee offered to prove that the inspectors of election of the second precinct committed the same irregularities that protestant claimed were committed by the election inspectors of the first precinct; and, that if all the conceded legal ballots of both precincts are examined and counted, the result will establish the election of the contestee and not the protestant.\u00a0 The court excluded the same\u00a0 and refused to examine and count the ballots of the second precinct on the ground that contestee made no objection to protestant's verbal motion to withdraw his (protestant's) allegations as to what occurred in the second precinct.\"<\/blockquote>The statement of this objection shows upon its face that the question of the jurisdiction of the court is not involved.\u00a0 The court has a right to determine what precincts are sufficiently involved in the charges\u00a0 of misconduct to warrant the opening of the ballot boxes used therein.\u00a0 An error incurred in the determination of that question will not deprive the court of jurisdiction or render its action void.\u00a0 It certainly will not be contended that, if the protestants really did withdraw his allegations with respect to the second precinct, the court erred in refusing to hear evidence in relation to it.\u00a0 The protestant is bound by his allegations, and if he withdraws those which attack the\u00a0 validity of the election in a given precinct and the parties proceed to trial upon the complaint as amended, it will not be seriously contended that the court errs when it refuses to permit the protestant to introduce evidence concerning the precinct expressly excluded from the petition.\u00a0 Petitioner's contention that, as a matter of fact, the allegations in relation to the second precinct were not withdrawn, is of no importance so far as the jurisdiction of the court is\u00a0 concerned.\u00a0 If that question was raised before the court and the court, upon the record and proceedings before it, found that the allegations were actually withdrawn, such finding is within the jurisdiction of the court, and, if erroneous, can be\u00a0 corrected only by appeal.\u00a0 We have held in the recent case of Herrera <i>vs<\/i>. Barretto and Joaquin, (<i>ante<\/i>, p. 245), as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It has\u00a0 been repeatedly held by this court that a writ of certiorari will not be issued unless it clearly appears that the court to which it is to be directed acted without or in excess of jurisdiction.\u00a0 It will not be issued to cure errors in the proceedings or to correct erroneous\u00a0 conclusions of law or of fact.\u00a0 If the\u00a0 court has jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the person, decisions upon all questions pertaining to the cause are decisions within its jurisdiction and, however irregular or erroneous they may be, cannot be corrected by certiorari\" (p. 249).<br\/><br\/>\"Jurisdiction is the\u00a0 authority to hear and determine a cause\u2014the right to act in a case.\u00a0 Since it is the power to hear and determine, it does not depend either upon the regularity of the exercise of that power or upon the rightfulness of the decisions made.\u00a0 Jurisdiction should therefore be distinguished from the exercise of jurisdiction.\u00a0 The authority to decide a cause at all, and not the decision rendered therein, is what makes up jurisdiction.\u00a0 Where there is jurisdiction of the person and subject matter, as we have said before, the decision of all other questions arising in the case is but\u00a0 an exercise of that jurisdiction\" (p. 251).<br\/><br\/>\"A full and thorough examination of all the decided cases in this court touching the question of certiorari and prohibition fully supports the proposition already stated that, where a Court of First Instance has jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the person, its decision of any question pertaining to the cause, however erroneous, cannot be reviewed by certiorari, but must be corrected by appeal\" (p. 271).<\/blockquote>What has been said in relation to petitioner's second objection is applicable also to his third, in which it is urged that \"the court, in declaring the election in precinct 1 void, acted outside of and in excess of his jurisdiction.\"\u00a0 There is no doubt about the right of the court to declare an election in a given precinct void if the facts proved warrant such a conclusion.\u00a0 The power, then, to declare an election void in a given precinct is undoubted.\u00a0 Whatever a court may do it has the <i>power<\/i> to do, and, although it act irregularly and\u00a0 arrive at a wrong conclusion, such irregularity and such error do not affect its jurisdiction.\u00a0 They are matters than can be cured only by appeal, and, where there is no appeal, they are errors that must be endured.<br\/><br\/>From these observations it is clear that the only question of jurisdiction presented to the court in these proceedings, namely, the failure to notify all of the candidates, is one of which this court will not take cognizance in the first instance.\u00a0 The other questions presented in no way affect the jurisdiction of the court to act in the premises, but deal at the most only with errors incurred by the court in the exercise of a jurisdiction already conceded.\u00a0 Such being the case, the writ of certiorari will no lie.\u00a0 (Herrera <i>vs<\/i>. Barretto and Joaquin, <i>supra<\/i>, and cases therein cited.)<br\/><br\/>The petitions for writs of certiorari in the nine cases above named are each and all denied, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

Tan Tayco (12 Phil. Rep., 739) and United States <i>vs<\/i>. Tin Masa (17\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 463).\u00a0 In these cases we expressly laid down the rule that a conviction upon a charge of having opium on one's premises or in one's possession will not be sustained where it appears that the <i>animus possidendi<\/i> was absent or that the defendant was not aware that the prohibited drug was on his premises or in his possession.<br\/><br\/>Cases may well arise wherein an innocent purchaser of a patent medicine or other medicinal preparation may be wholly unaware of the fact that such preparation contains opium, and under the rule laid down in the cases above cited such innocent purchaser is not guilty of a violation of the penalized provisions of the statute.\u00a0 But the mere uncorroborated claim of the accused that he did not know that the preparation found in his possession contained opium, will rarely be sufftcient to overcome the presumption to the contrary.\u00a0 The fact of lack of knowledge, if it existed, is one peculiarly within his own breast, and before accepting his claim, Tie may well be required to make a full, frank, and honest statement of all the circumstances as to time, place, and conditions under which he came into possession of the preparation containing the prohibited drug; and any evasion, false statement, or attempt at concealment on the part of the accused will justify\u00a0 the courts in declining to believe the truth of his claim of ignorance.\u00a0 Under the express terms of the statute, proof of the mere fact of possession, in a case such as that at bar, will sustain a conviction, unless a reasonable doubt arises, from the peculiar circumstances of the case, as to whether the accused was aware\u00a0 that the article under his control contained the prohibited drug.<br\/><br\/>After a careful consideration of the whole record, we are unable to\u00a0 say that the trial judge erred in refusing to believe the highly improbable story of the accused that he had purchased the pills six years prior to the date of his arrest, at a time when, as he admitted, he was a licensed user of opium, but that he did not know that they contained opium, and the he had kept them ever since because he was frequently compelled to have recourse to them as a medicine.<br\/><br\/>This story does not ring true, and was satisfactorily show to be false by the testimony of the revenue agents, who swore that at the time when the pills were found in his possession he admitted that he knew they contained opium, at the same time insisting that the amount was so small that he should not be proceeded against because of it.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial court should be and they are hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

and furthermore to pay the plaintiff P200 for the 1911 crop, after deducting therefrom the sum of P50 which plaintiff owed defendant, with the obligation on the latter's part to execute and deliver to plaintiff a deed of conveyance of the said lands, but with the cost of the execution thereof charged against plaintiff, defendant to pay the costs of the suit.<br\/><br\/>On August 24, 1911, counsel for Victorino del Castillo filed a written complaint with the Court of First Instance of Albay wherein he set forth, as a first cause of action, that, being the owner of two parcels of hemp land situated in the barrio of Boang, of the pueblo of Tabaco, the respective area and boundaries of which are specified in the complaint, the defendant, Pablo Escarella, on July 1, 1911, usurped the said parcels of land, deprived the plaintiff of the possession and enjoyment of the same and unlawfully appropriated to himself all their fruits and products, whereby the plaintiff was injured to the extent of P2,000;

in 1904, P300; in 1906 and 1907, P100 and P200; and during the years from 1907 to 1910, P150 in three installments of P50 each; that the total amount of such partial payments amounted to P1,150, leaving a balance due the defendant, on the price of the land sold, of P50; that the plaintiff was willing to pay the defendant this balance to complete the price of the land purchased by the former for P1,200; that a demand having been made upon the defendant to execute a deed of sale and conveyance of the said land, he refused to comply therewith, denying that he had made such sale to the plaintiff, and on July\u00a0 1, 1911, seized the land under the pretext of being the owner thereof; and that, during the course of ten years that had elapsed from the time of the purchase to date, the plaintiff had succeeded in improving the said land by dint of labor and by expenditure of his own money, whereby the hitherto uncultivated tracts were converted into two hemp-producing properties of great value and profit.\u00a0 He therefore prayed that judgment be awarded his client for the ownership and possession of the said land, for damages in the sum of P2,000 and the costs, and that the defendant\u00a0 be ordered to execute a deed of sale and conveyance of the property to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer entered against the complaint having been overruled, counsel for the defendant, who entered an exception to the order overruling the demurrer, made in his answer a general and specific denial of each and all of the allegations contained in the complaint, with the exception of those admitted in the answer.\u00a0 As a special defense he alleged that the defendant was the owner of the lands described in the complaint and as such appointed the plaintiff as caretaker or manager to take charge of the cultivation and harvesting of the abaca planted thereon, with instructions to render him an account of the products of the same; that during the past two years the plaintiff, failing to conduct himself as a good caretaker, had, without the defendant's authorization, derived gain from the abaca harvested, wherefore he was several times admonished, and as the plaintiff did not change his conduct the defendant had to remove him from the position which he was holding; that he denied having executed any contract whatever, either verbal or written, relative to the sale of the said parcels of land to the plaintiff; and that he also denied each and all of the allegations referring to the second cause of action, inasmuch as the defendant had been and still was the owner of the said land.<br\/><br\/>As a cross-complaint he alleged that the plaintiff owed him the products of the said land for the two years stated, amounting to a total of ten thousand kilos of abaca.\u00a0 He therefore prayed that he be absolved from the complaint and that the plaintiff be sentenced in accordance with the petition of the cross-complaint and to payment of the costs.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, in his answer to the said cross-complaint, denied each and all of the allegations therein contained.<br\/><br\/>The case having come to trial, with the introduction of evidence by both parties, the court rendered the judgment before mentioned, to which the defendant excepted and made a written motion for a reopening of the case and a new hearing.\u00a0 This motion was denied, an exception to the ruling was saved by the appellant and, upon presentation of the proper bill of exceptions, the same was approved and transmitted to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff brought an action of ejectment against the defendant for the purpose of recovering two tracts of land of his ownership which the latter usurped in the first part of July, 1911; and notwithstanding the defendant's averment that he is the owner of the land in question, we accept the statement of facts, the conclusions and the grounds of law contained in the judgment of the lower court, inasmuch as the record shows it to have been duly proved that the plaintiff, Victorino del Castillo, acquired the said land by purchase from the defendant, Pablo Escarella, in April, 1901, and was in the possession and enjoyment of the same until July, 1911, when\u00a0 it was usurped and detained by the vendor-defendant, its previous owner, who received from the vendee plaintiff the major part of the price of the sale, fixed at P1,200, there remaining\u00a0 to be paid him only a balance of P50 to effect the complete payment of the price of the land sold, for the vendor has already received from the plaintiff the sum of P1,150.<br\/><br\/>It is an indisputable fact that the plaintiff held the land prior to its detention by the defendant, although the latter alleges that the former occupied it as his caretaker and tenant on shares, and that the amounts which the defendant received from the plaintiff\u00a0 were, in part, derived from the products of the land and, in part, reimbursements for a sum which he had deposited with the plaintiff, which averments were not substantiated by satisfactory proof.<br\/><br\/>As against the oral evidence introduced by the defendant, the record contains as exhibits letters addresed by Pablo Escarella to his relative Victorino del Castillo, the plaintiff, and in one of these, that designated A, Escarella begged Castillo to pay him the balance of his account for the coconut land which Castillo and his wife had purchased from him, because Escarella was in urgent need of the money.\u00a0 The defendant further stated therein that, for the purpose indicated, he would send Leon Borais, a person of his confidence, to bear the letter to the plaintiff and that the latter could request from the messenger a receipt for such amount as he might deliver to him.\u00a0 In the letter, Exhibit B, addressed by the defendant Escarella to the plaintiff Victorino del Castillo, the writer stated that he had an engagement to fulfill by the end of October, 1905, and begged the addressee to remit him the said balance, or at least some part of it, by the bearer of the letter, Juan Bronolla; and in the letter, Exhibit C, Escarella informed Castillo that he had received the latter's letter from the bearer thereof, together with the sum of P100, and invited Castillo to come to his, Escarella's, house in order that they might adjust the pending accounts, as a precaution counseled by the uncertainty of life.<br\/><br\/>The defendant testified that he did not write the said three letters, but that they were in his wife's handwriting.\u00a0 The trial court, however, with respect to this point, states in his judgment that the general appearance of these letters shows that they were written by a man, and not by a woman, and the signature written by the defendant in the presence of the judge convincingly proves that the signatures that appear in the said documents are the genuine signatures of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The record discloses no reasonable ground that may lawfully prevent the acceptance of the opinion formed by the trial judge or of his findings based upon the evidence adduced by the parties during the trial.\u00a0 We therefore hold, in conformity with that evidence, that the two parcels of land were in fact sold to the plaintiff for P1,200, in April, 1901, and, consequently, that the plaintiff, unlawfully deprived of his possession, is entitled to recover the said land.<br\/><br\/>The circumstance that only a verbal contract was executed between Escarella and Castillo for the sale of the said parcels of land detracts nothing from the binding force of the covenant entered into by the contracting parties, since the said contract of sale was stipulated prior even to the enactment of the Code of Civil Procedure, and, according to the provisions of articles 1278 and 1280 of the Civil Code, a verbal contract of sale of realty shall be valid and effective, provided the essential conditions required for its validity exist.\u00a0 The supreme court of Spain, in its decision of June 18, 1902, where the aforecited article 1280 is applied, sets up the legal doctrine that it is not an essential requisite for the subsistence of certain contracts that they should be recorded in a public or private instrument in accordance with law, but is a coercive means granted to the contracting parties to enable them to compel each other to observe that prescribed form.\u00a0 This same rule is laid down in the decisions rendered in the cases of Thunga Chui <i>vs<\/i>. Que Bentec (2 Phil. Rep., 561), and Couto <i>vs<\/i>. Cortes (8 Phil. Rep., 459).<br\/><br\/>Upon the perfectly proved premise, then, that the defendant, Escarella, sold the land in question to the plaintiff, Castillo, it cannot be denied that the action of ejectment brought is proper, and the defendant must return the usurped property and execute the proper deed of sale in plaintiff's favor, who in turn must pay the defendant the balance of the price of the sale, and the latter is obligated to make reimbursement for the value of the crop which he gathered from the land, as ordered in the judgment appealed from, which is in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the said judgment are deemed to have been refuted, we hereby affirm that judgment, with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Lobingier, judge, overruled the said demurrer and proceeded to hear the case upon its merits, and finally rendered a judgment revoking and annulling the order of the Insular Collector of Customs denying the right of said Young Wampo to enter the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>From that judgment the Insular Collector of Customs appealed to this court and assigns as his principal error here, that the Court of First Instance was without jurisdiction to revise, modify, reverse or annul the decision of the Collector of Customs under the procedure adopted by the appellee.<br\/><br\/>The remedy of certiorari can only be invoked \"when the ground of the complaint in an action in a Court of First Instance (or the Supreme Court) is that an inferior tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial functions has exceeded the jurisdiction of such tribunal, board, or officer, and t<i>here is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy.\"<\/i> (Secs. 217 and 514, Act No. 190.)\u00a0 We have in numerous cases decided that the Collector of Customs has jurisdiction to inquire into the right of an alien immigrant to enter the Philippine Islands.

(<i>c<\/i>) A tract of rural land in the said sitio, 2 hectares 82 ares and 88 centares in area, bounded\u00a0 on the north by the lands of the said Dancel; on the east and west, by those of Cirilo Puruganan; and on the south, by uncultivated land, (<i>d<\/i>) A tract of rural land in the same sitio, 34 ares and 44 centares in area, bounded on the north and the east by the lands of Cirilo Puruganan; on the south, by those of the deceased Jose Dancel; and on the west, by a watercourse; that, in 1903, the defendants, Julian Ventura and Miguel Agustin, being foremen of the farmer tenants who were cultivating the land in Gambeng, and Teodoro Martin and Ramon Barruga, being likewise foremen of the farmer tenants who were cultivating the lands in Corcuera, ceased without just cause to pay the rent agreed upon, refused to recognize\u00a0 the plaintiffs as the owners of the said property, and appropriated the same, claiming that they were\u00a0 the owners thereof; and that the defendants thereby caused to the plaintiffs losses and damages\u00a0 in the amount of P768, equivalent to 96 <i>uyones<\/i> of paddy which they failed to furnish the latter, at the rate of 16 <i>uyones<\/i> a year and P8 per <i>uyon<\/i>, since 1903; and they asked that a judgment of recovery be rendered in their behalf by sentencing the defendants to restore to them the aforedescribed rural nroperty together with the products thereof unduly collected since 1903, and to the payment of the costs.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer interposed by the said four defendants to the aforementioned complaint having been overruled, their counsel, by a writing of August 11 of the same year, denied each and all of the grounds of the complaint and alleged that the defendants were not liable, in their capacity of foremen\u00a0 of the farmer tenants who were\u00a0 cultivating the said lands, for the payment of rent to the\u00a0 plaintiffs; that the defendants had not received and did not possess the said lands; that the plaintiffs had brought suit for rescission of contract against the defendants Teodoro Martin and Ramon Barruga, of Corcuera, and Julian Ventura and Miguel Agustin, of Gambeng, wherein they demanded\u00a0 of the defendants as their tenants on shares the payment of the rent for the said lands from 1903, claiming that the latter had\u00a0 not paid the\u00a0 same; that, in that suit, the defendants were absolved, as the plaintiffs did not prove that they had delivered the said lands to the defendants, nor that there existed any contract of\u00a0 lease between the plaintiffs and the defendants; that if the plaintiffs had tenants on shares who cultivated lands in Corcuera and Gambeng and were not the defendants, such tenants who failed to pay the rent demanded must be the defendants, and not their foremen, Ventura and Agustin, of Gambeng, and Martin and Barruga, of Corcuera, who did not as tenants of the plaintiffs receive any land to cultivate and had not, in the character of foremen, endeavored to appropriate the lands described in the complaint, nor did they in any manner persuade the plaintiff's farmer tenants to cease paying the rental price thereof.\u00a0 Defendants' counsel therefore asked that his clients be absolved from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>In view of the fact that, as disclosed by an inspection of the said lands, held thereon by the clerk of the court attended by the parties and their respective counsel and a surveyor, on February\u00a0 20, 1909, the defendants were in possession of but a small part of the lands in litigation, the rest of the same being occupied by more than fifty persons, mentioned by name in the record of the said inspection, who claimed to be the owners of the respective portions of land held by them, the court, on April 14, 1909, ordered that the complaint be amended so as to include therein as parties defendant all the persons whose names appeared in the aforementioned record of inspection and in the plan drawn up by the surveyor.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the plaintiffs, being notified of the preceding order, asked that another new inspection be made, that the adjoining landowners specified in the complaint be summoned, and that the right be reserved to his clients to make or not to make the said amendment; but the court, by an order of November 5, overruled the motion and warned the plaintiffs' counsel that if he did not, in accordance with previous directions and within the unextendible period of five days, amend the complaint, the case would be decided in pursuance of law.<br\/><br\/>In compliance with the aforesaid order of the court, the plaintiffs, Isidora Dancel and Joaquin Madamba, the latter in his capacity of guardian of the minor Esteban Mina, filed a written amendment to their original complaint, by including therein the persons named Inocencio Pana, Melecio Estavillo, Evaristo Crisostomo, Leoncio Agustin, Prospero Bautista, Ciriaco Mariano, German Santos, Paula Santos, Nicolas Mariano, Tomas Mariano, Simeon Mariano, Placido Santos, Juan Calixto, Candido Mariano, Julio Agcaoili, Desiderio Diego, Pedro Lloreta, Cecilio Calucag, Gelasio Mata, Isidora Nery, Matias Nicolas, Braulio Manuel, Restituto Miguel, Severo Ancheta, Silverio Martin, Pascual Mariano, Leon de Lara, Eustaquio Ancheta, Teodoro Ruiz, Lucio Martin, Apolonio Agustin,\u00a0 Melquiades Martin, Juvenal Mariano, Ramon Mariano, and Teodoro Ancheta, and reproduced in full in said amendment all the facts of possession and ownership alleged in the complaint thus amended, and\u00a0 asked that judgment be rendered in their behalf by sentencing the defendants immediately to restore to the plaintiffs the lands in question, to pay damages and the costs.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendants Matias Nicolas, Pedro Loreto and Braulio Manuel denied all the grounds of the complaint and alleged as a defense that his clients held lands in Gambeng and Corcuera, as they had inherited them from their forefathers, that they had\u00a0 been in the possession and enjoyment of the said lands for more than thirty years, and that the property or land held by the\u00a0 defendants and claimed by the plaintiffs was not described in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 demurrer filed to the\u00a0 amended complaint by the other defendants having been overruled, counsel for these latter, by a written motion of July\u00a0 15, 1910, asked for their absolution with the costs against the plaintiffs, and, to this end, denied all the essential allegations on which the said complaint was based, since, he alleged, these defendants held as owners their respective lands in the sitios of Gambeng and Corcuera, they each and all of them or their\u00a0 spouses having acquired the same either personally or by purchase, donation, or inheritance, and had been known as such possessors and owners for more than thirty years; that the plaintiffs\u00a0 were not known either as the possessors or the owners of any land or lands in the said sitios of Gambeng arid Corcuera of the pueblo of Solsona, as an action brought by the plaintiffs against some of the defendants, for the rescission of a contract of lease, was decided against the plaintiffs, for the defendants did not recognize and had not recognized them, nor their predecessors, nor any other persons, to have any interest in the ownership and\u00a0 possession of the lands belonging to the defendants, which are situated in the said sitios of Gambeng and Corcuera.<br\/><br\/>The case having come, to trial and evidence having been introduced by the parties, counsel for the defendants, in another writing of August 12, 1910, alleged among other things that the\u00a0 plaintiffs had not presented any evidence whatever, except what had\u00a0 already been introduced, against the demurrer of the new defendants, the witnesses of which plaintiffs testified that the lands sought to be recovered were under the control of the first four defendants and they made no mention of the other new defendants; that the action for recovery was based on a title of ownership which did not show the identity of the lands claimed, as was and had been seen by the plan drawn by the surveyor on the occasion of the ocular inspection, inasmuch as the said title specified three hectares in connection with the plaintiffs, while from the inspection and survey made of the lands in Gambeng the same were found to contain seven hectares; that it appeared from the will left by Nicolasa Agcaoili, from whom the plaintiffs claimed to have inherited the lands in litigation, that the testatrix had only one parcel of land of 166 <i>uyones<\/i> of paddy in Gambeng and another parcel in Corcuera, though in Gambeng she held a little more than three hectares or an area sufficient for sowing 30 <i>uyones<\/i> of rice, which is one-fifth of the area mentioned in the will; that the defendants' rights of ownership were duly proved at the trial by witnesses familiar with the said localities, who testified that the plaintiffs did not possess any land whatever in the said places; and that the defendants had not paid for their lands any annual charge or rent to anyone, but had paid the taxes thereon to the Government.<br\/><br\/>In view\u00a0 of all the foregoing, the court, on August 22, 1910, rendered the judgment aforementioned, exception to which was taken, by counsel for the plaintiffs, who moved that it be set aside and a new trial granted, inasmuch as the evidence did not sufficiently justify the said judgment and the findings of fact were openly and manifestly contrary to such evidence.\u00a0 This motion was overruled by an order of September 2, and exception thereto was filed by the plaintiffs, who presented the proper bill of exceptions, which was approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>The action brought by counsel for the plaintiffs has for its object the recovery or restitution of four parcels of land situated, one of them in the place called Gambeng and the other three in Corcuera, of the municipality of Dingras Solsona, Ilocos Norte, for the reason that they have been detained and usurped by the 4 defendants and 35 other residents of those localities.<br\/><br\/>The complaint filed in this case is founded on the rights which the plaintiffs had in the lands claimed by virtue of their title of\u00a0 ownership issued to Nicolasa Agcaoili, an ancestress and predecessor in interest of the plaintiffs, by the director-general of the <i>administracion civil<\/i>, on May 13, 1889, and recorded with the <i>inspeccion general de montes<\/i> and the civil government of the said province, on May 21 and June 26 of the same year, 1889, respectively, and inscribed in the property registry on December 2, 1891. In this deed it appears that the said Nicolasa Agcaoili was gratuitously awarded, by composition with the State,\u00a0 six parcels of land, among which are included the third, situated in Gambeng, and the fourth, fifth, and sixth, in the sitio of Corcuera, with statements of their respective boundaries and area.<br\/><br\/>For the purpose of issuing the said title, the proper administrative proceedings must have been had by the provincial board, with the indispensable condition that the applicant should have been, for the number of years required by law, in possession of the lands whose composition was sought, and, during the course of such procedure, the proper publications must have been made in the town and there must ,also have been effected the location and survey of the lands intended to be the subject of the concession granted by and in the name of the Government, in such manner that, after the termination of all the required proceedings and the issuance and inscription of the title in the property registry, the concessionary who obtained the registered title was the sole proprietress of the adjudicated land or lands entered in her name in the registry, until such title should be annulled or cancelled by final jugdment of the courts.<br\/><br\/>The record does not show that the title obtained by Nicolasa Agcaoili, through composition with the State, to the six parcels of land, which include the four parcels in litigation, has been annulled and cancelled by any final judgment ; on the contrary, the contents of the decision rendered by the <i>Real Audiencia de Manila<\/i>, on October 7,1872, affirming the judgment of November 9, 1871, raised on appeal from the Court of First Instance, are perfectly in accord with the said title as regards the tenure and ownership of the\u00a0 lands in question.\u00a0 The plaintiffs, therefore, as the successors of the said Nicolasa Agcaoili, are unquestionably entitled to claim the lands unlawfully usurped by the defendants.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the identification of the six parcels of land concerned in the said title, their respective boundaries and area\u00a0 are clearly and specifically determined, as seen by the mere reading of the document found on page 1 of the record of proceedings for title, and, therefore, the plaintiffs not only have proven their ownership under a perfectly valid and efficacious title, not invalidated by any other better one\u00a0 adversely filed, nor canceled by an express declaration in a final judgment rendered by a court of law, but also have proved in a conclusive manner the identity of the four parcels of land claimed by them, which certainly have not disappeared from the territory of Ilocos Norte.\u00a0 The change of name of some of the boundaries can be no impediment to the recovery sought, for the reason that the plaintiffs could not have lost their right of ownership, except through ordinary or extraordinary prescription of dominion legitimately acquired by the lapse of time respectively specified by law.<br\/><br\/>Aside from the documentary evidence which most fully proves the plaintiffs' ownership of the lands, in question and their right to have the same restored to them, the record offers satisfactory oral proof, consisting of the testimony of six witnesses who in a uniform and decisive manner affirmed that the plaintiffs were the legitimate owners and possessors of the said four parcels of land which are occupied by the first four defendants, Julian Ventura, Miguel Agustin, Teodoro\u00a0 Martin, and Ramon Barruga, as tenants or lessees of the plaintiffs.\u00a0 These four occupants, as well as the 35 persons who, it appears, now occupy a part of the said parcels of land and are likewise defendants in this suit, have adduced no proof whatever of the title under which, as alleged\u00a0 owners, they at present hold the disputed lands.<br\/><br\/>True it is that it is sufficient for the possessor to hold in order to be respected in the possession he enjoys, so long as no other claimant appears who may have and prove a better right; but it is no less true that from the moment it shall have been proven that such possessor detains and is usurping the property unduly to the prejudice of the owner who has proved his ownership under legitimate title, it is of course proper, and strict justice demands, that the usurped property be\u00a0 restored.<br\/><br\/>The 39 defendants come within the case just mentioned, inasmuch as, besides their mere holding or detention of the said lands, they have\u00a0 not proved that their possession in the quality of owners is lawful and\u00a0 is supported by any right that must be respected by the courts; while, on the other hand, the plaintiffs have perfectly proved their ownership rights in the said lands by authentic documents and a title issued by the administrative authorities in the name of the State and must be considered as the sole lawful owners of the lands in question.\u00a0 Moreover, it cannot be affirmed that the plaintiffs, by the usurpation and detention of the defendants, have legally lost the possession they were enjoying, inasmuch as the usurpation of a property creates no right in behalf of the intruders or usurpers, to the prejudice of the lawful owners thereof who can lose their ownership rights only through a long prescription which, in the present case, the defendants certainly have not satisfactorily acquired against the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, the fact that a majority of the defendants have paid the land tax does not of itself, though proven by receipts issued by the Government, sufficiently establish that they are the owners of the lands which they declared in bad faith to be theirs.\u00a0 Neither does a final judgment, unfavorable to the plaintiffs, in the matter of the rescission of a lease, prove that any of the defendants were the owners of the lands in question, because the present case deals with the dominion over and ownership of certain lands the recovery or restitution of which is demanded by the plaintiffs, and the only judgment that can invalidate the right and title of the plaintiffs is a final one declaring the defendants, or third persons not connected with the plaintiffs, to be the owners of the lands in question.\u00a0 So long as no one appears with better title\u00a0 and right than those shown by the plaintiffs, they are\u00a0 entitled to the protection of the law.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, it is proper, with a reversal of the judgment appealed from, to sentence, and we hereby do sentence, all the 39 defendants therein named to restore to the plaintiffs the four parcels of land in question, in the possession of which the latter shall be placed in accordance with Jaw. No special finding is made either with respect to the fruits produced by the said property, on account of the absence of proof of the importance and amount thereof, or as to the costs of both instances.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellmo, C.

PEDRO YULO ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Appeal taken through bill of exceptions by counsel for the defendants from judgment of April 27, 1912, wherein the Honorable J. S. Powell, judge, directed that the plaintiff in this case recover from the defendants the sum of P30,000 as principal and P8,200 as interest and that the principal draw interest at the rate of 15 per cent a year from this date, with the costs.<br\/><br\/>On January 15, 1912, Florencio R. Fabie presented in the Court of First.\u00a0 Instance of Iloilo a written amended complaint against the defendants, alleging as grounds of action that said defendants are the children and lawful heirs of Teodoro Yulo y Belleza and Mrs. Gregoria Regalado Yulo, both deceased, the testamentary proceedings in the case of the former being now pending in said court; that his present administrator is Francisco Yulo, who is sued in his own personality and in his character as judicial administrator of said estate and also in his character as legal guardian of the incompetent Teodoro Yulo Regalado, while Mariano Yulo is likewise sued in his character as legal guardian of the minor Jose Yulo; that Teodoro Yulo y Belleza in his lifetime owed the plaintiff Fabie the sum of P30,000, with the obligation of paying as interest the sum of P2,250 for each six months at the rate of 15 per cent a year; that on March 23,1904, the defendants and their mother, Mrs. Gregoria Regalado Yulo, acknowledged Teodoro Yulo's debt of P30,000 to the plaintiff, took upon themselves the responsibility of paying it and promised to settle it with the plaintiff at the end of five years from that date, March 23, 1904, with the right reserved to them to renew the debt if they could come to terms with the plaintiff, payment of P2,250 in current money being stipulated as semiannual interest on the debt; that the defendants punctually paid said interest until July 31,1910, but from that date they violated the agreement and ceased to pay the interest stipulated and refused to pay the principal with interest thereon, in spite of the demands of the plaintiff and the fact that the agreement ended on July 31,1910. Neither has the administrator of the testamentary estate of Teodoro Yulo, despite the demands made, paid the interest amounting to P6,250 owed to the plaintiff from the date when they ceased to pay up to December 31,1911. Judgment was prayed sentencing either the defendants as heirs of the deceased Teodoro Yulo y Belleza or the administrator of his estate to payment of the principal of the debt, P30,000, the interest due up to December 31, 1911, which amounts to P6,250, and in addition the interest that might become due from that date until complete payment of the debt on the basis of P2,250 for each six months, and also the legal interest upon the interest due and unpaid, with the costs of this suit.<br\/><br\/>The demurrers filed by the defendants to the foregoing complaint of March 27, i912, having been overruled, counsel for the defendants, with the exception of Pedro Yulo, replied to the foregoing amended complaint admitting the allegations contained in the first and second paragraphs thereof arid denying each and all of the allegations contained in each and all of the other paragraphs thereof.\u00a0 Counsel for the other defendant, Pedro Yulo, in his reply admitted the allegations contained in the first and second paragraphs of the amended complaint and denied each and all of the facts alleged in each and all of the remaining paragraphs thereof.<br\/><br\/>After due trial and presentation of evidence by\u00a0 the parties, the court rendered the judgment mentioned, to which counsel for the plaintiffs excepted, asking for a new trial.\u00a0 This motion was denied by order of April 30, 1912, with exception on the part of the defendants.\u00a0 The proper bill of exceptions was submitted by the defendants, except Gregorio Yulo, approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>In this suit payment is sought of the sum of P30,000 that Teodoro Yulo y Belleza owed at his death to the plaintiff Florencio Fabie, with interest at 15 per cent a year.\u00a0 The justness of the debt is positive and indisputable, for the widow and heirs of the deceased, duly represented by one of their number, Gregorio Yulo y Regalado, through power of attorney executed by them on April 11, 1903, not only freely and spontaneously acknowledged said debt but also further agreed to pay it to the creditor Fabie or his representative, with interest at the rate of 15 per cent a year in the sum of P2,250 for each six months from June, 1904, and each quarter thereafter for five years, at the end of which period it would be optional with the creditor to draw in his principal or extend the time of payment under the same conditions or others that might be stipulated.\u00a0 The property of the estate of the deceased Enrique Castillo, wherein said sum had been invested, with the personal property of the said widow and heirs of the deceased debtor, was fixed as guaranty for fulfillment of the obligation.\u00a0 A11 this is recorded in an instrument executed by them on March 23, 1904, and ratified before a notary on the same date.<br\/><br\/>It is a fact beyond doubt and admitted by the defendants that the deceased Teodoro Yulo y Belleza in his lifetime received from the plaintiff creditor various amounts of money which for purposes of settlement reach the important sum of P30,000.\u00a0 The only point not cleared up, or duly proven in the case, is whether upon receiving as a loan the sum now demanded and in signing the notes he gave for the loan the debtor did so as administrator and heir of the deceased Enrique Castillo or simply as a personal debtor for that amount.\u00a0 In his sworn statement Gregorio Yulo asserts the former, saying that his deceased father, by virtue of an appointment made by the provost court of Iloilo during the military government, signed among other documents the said notes in Fabie's favor and countersigned them administrator, but did not remember whether he did so also as heir of the deceased Castillo.\u00a0 But the creditor Fabie swore that he did not know that Teodoro Yulo y Belleza was the administrator of the property of said deceased and he did not remember having seen any countersign on the notes issued to him indicating in any way that the former was the administrator of Castillo's property, for he lent his money to Teodoro Yulo, who in his lifetime paid the amount of the notes with interest thereon, until his death, and after his death his son, Gregorio Yulo, told him that he was authorized by the widow and his brothers and sisters to continue the payments in the same manner as had been done previously, and since that time he had dealt with him, for he thought him honest, and in fact while he was in Europe Gregorio continued to send him the interest stipulated, through Messrs. Inchausti &amp; Co., until June, 1910.\u00a0 But when Gregorio Yulo ceased to be administrator of the property of his father, his brother, Francisco Yulo, who assumed the administration, failed to pay said interest from that month of June to date.\u00a0 He added that the notes were returned to the heirs of the debtor upon the execution of the said instrument of March 23, 1904.<br\/><br\/>Although it is recorded in this instrument that the said amount was used for the improvement of the property that formed part of the estate of the deceased Castillo, which point the creditor says he did not pay any great attention to on signing the instrument when he was arranging to start, for Europe, still it is certain that the various sums making up the total amount demanded were received as a loan, not by Enrique Castillo in his lifetime, but by Teodoro Yulo, who, according to the defendants, was the administrator of the property of the said Castillo and also his heir; and the creditor on his part asserts that he delivered his money as a loan to Teodoro Yulo personally, a fact not denied by Gregorio Yulo in his testimony.<br\/><br\/>Even though Teodoro Yulo may have in his lifetime\u00a0 borrowed from the creditor Fabie various amounts up to P30,000, with interest at 15 per cent a year, in the character of administrator of the property of the deceased Castillo, whose heir he was, as both parties admitted and stipulated, the obligation to pay the sum borrowed rests upon Teodoro Yulo himself, who received it, as the only person responsible for payment thereof, without obligation or right on the creditor's part to proceed against the testate succession or against the administration of Enrique Castillo's property, even admitting that the money was used for the benefit of that estate.<br\/><br\/>If, then, Teodoro Yulo was the only one\u00a0 personal responsible for the amount he received, even\u00a0 as administrator of the property of the deceased Castillo, it follows that after his death, which occurred on April 9, 1903, his heirs would be responsible for the fulfillment of the obligation assumed in life by the dead debtor, their predecessor in interest.<br\/><br\/>Article 661 of the Civil Code says:\u00a0 \"Heirs succeed the deceased in all his rights and obligations by the mere fact of his death.\"<br\/><br\/>Article 659 of the same Code also says:\u00a0 \"The inheritance includes all the property, rights, and obligations of a person, which are not extinguished by his death.\"\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>But, aside from the obligation to which the deceased debtor's children have succeeded to pay the sum demanded, which he owed when alive, it appears in the notarial instrument executed on March 23, 1904, that the widow and heirs of the deceased Teodoro Yulo acknowledged and took upon themselves the responsibility contracted by him when alive and bound themselves to pay the principal and the interest stipulated, wherefore it is beyond question that the defendants as successors of the deceased debtor Teodoro Yulo and his widow, their mother, Gregoria Regalado y Santa Ana, who also later died, are under obligation to pay the sum demanded.<br\/><br\/>The allegation that the money received in his lifetime by the deceased teodoro Yulo from Florencio Fabie was used in improving the property of the deceased Enrique, Castillo cannot, as the judgment appealed from says, affect the creditor's rights, for the reason that Teodoro Yulo was the debtor and the debtor personally responsible for payment of the debt and not the estate of the deceased Castillo, for the latter at his death owed nothing to the plaintiff, and therefore his estate cannot be responsible for the amounts borrowed and received by the administrator of his property after his death, since the law does not authorize the executor or administrator of the property of a deceased person to contract debts or establish obligations to the injury and prejudice of the deceased's heirs, and in case the administrator or executor has so acted, he alone will be responsible with his own property for the debts and obligations contracted by him.<br\/><br\/>On the hypothesis that the testate or intestate succession of the deceased Teodoro Yulo is solely responsible and his property is liable for payment of the sum demanded in the complaint, the action exercised by the defendants, with the sole exception of the incompetent Teodoro Yulo and the minor Jose Yulo, forthwith becomes proper, for until all the debts of a deceased person are paid his undivided estate must be regarded as under administration, and only after the obligations and debts contracted by the deceased have been settled can the portion to be divided among the heirs be known.\u00a0 (Sec. 753, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>Article 1026 of the Civil Code prescribes:\u00a0 \"Until all the known creditors and the legatees have been paid, it shall be understood that the estate is under administration.\"\u00a0 And according to the principle laid down by the Supreme Court in a judgment of March 2, 1896, only after all the obligations of the estate have been settled can the portion to be divided among the heirs be known.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the defendants as heirs of the deceased Teodoro Yulo, are under obligation to pay the sum demanded by Florencio Fabie, and with greater reason, since the widow and heirs who were of age took upon themselves the obligation contracted by the deceased toward the plaintiff and bound themselves to pay the debt with the interest thereon. In the power of attorney executed by the widow and adult children in favor of some of their own number, among these, Gregorio Yulo, it appears that the widow, Gregoria Regalado, executed it as guardian of the incompetent Teodoro Yulo, and as mother and guardian of her minor children, Concepcion and Jose, the former of whom seems to have become of age even before this suit was instituted, and the other is now represented by Mariano Yulo. Nor has Concepcion directly impugned the validity of the obligation contracted by her mother in her behalf and therefore it may be taken for granted that she has by her silence ratified the obligation to pay, jointly with her mother and brothers, the sum her father owed when he died. (Art. 1313, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>Even keeping in mind that the mother of said minors and incompetent could not validly represent them in the execution of the power of attorney in favor of some of her children, among these Gregorio Yulo, to contract said obligation, for the Code of Civil Procedure was already in force in the Islands, it cannot be denied that the adult executors of said power of attorney through Gregorio Yulo, as their representative, bound themselves in said instrument to acknowledge and assume the debt of their deceased father and to pay it in the manner agreed upon; and it is improper to impugn said instrument of March 23, 1904, for the sole reason that their mother was not duly authorized by law to represent their brothers and sisters, one an incompetent and the other two minors, especially when at best said incompetent and minors would not have been obligated, but the adults are perfectly bound to fulfill the obligation therein assumed, which with reference to them is absolutely valid and effective under the law.<br\/><br\/>If three days after Teodoro Yulo's death his widow and adult children realized that it was very necessary for them to continue his business in the manner he, their predecessor in interest, had carried it on and that they should administer and take charge of all his property and assume the obligations and contracts he had left, and for this purpose they ought to execute the power of attorney discussed, so that the representatives appointed, as the instrument itself says, might continue to administer and manage all the branches of their business in the same way as their deceased father had in his lifetime, might sign any kind of document in the name of the widow and children of the deceased Teodoro Yulo, lend or borrow for the best management of the business, etc., it follows that they are then under obligation to fulfill the contract in the said instrument in favor of the creditor Florencio Fabie, whom they made to believe, as they did everybody with whom they made a contract, that they were disposed to keep their agreements.<br\/><br\/>It is to be noted that up to date the property of the deceased Teodoro Yulo is still undivided and that this suit deals with a hereditary debt acknowledged and assumed by his widow and heirs. It must also be remembered that under the law their obligation to pay the sum demanded by a creditor is a joint one even though it is not so openly expressed, for he has the right to demand the whole of his credit from all or any of the heirs of the deceased debtor, they having accepted the inheritance without benefit of inventory, as well as from the minors and the incompetent up to the amount of their respective shares in the inheritance.\u00a0 The number of heirs of his deceased debtor is a matter of indifference to the creditor, as the debt is a single one, for which the still undivided estate is liable, and the obligation of the heirs toward the creditor is one and indivisible.\u00a0 The divisibility of the debt among the heirs responsible and that of the estate resulting from their common relations cannot affect the creditor's right, which existed prior to the death of Teodoro Yulo, defendants' predecessor in interest.\u00a0 Neither law nor reason exists to oblige the creditor to divide his action according to the number of his debtor's heirs, with the risks and expenses involved in a multiplicity of suits.<br\/><br\/>The obligation contracted by the widow and adult heirs of the deceased Teodoro Yulo in the instrument mentioned would be ineffective, with respect to the incompetent and the minor Jose Yulo, but there can be no question about the force and effect of the obligation contracted by the adults and by the representative of the minor Concepcion Yulo, who has not since she became of age directly impugned the obligation contracted on her account by her mother, Gregoria Regalado.<br\/><br\/>Article 1085 of the Civil Gode says:\u00a0 \"The coheir who shall have paid more than pertains to his share in the inheritance, may demand his proportionate part of the others.\"<br\/><br\/>It is a principle of law that while lawful debts exist there cannot be a net inheritance divisible among the heirs of the deceased debtor, and therefore it cannot be denied that the lawful portions belonging, respectively, to the incompetent Teodofo, and the minor Jose Yulo, are liable and legally responsible for payment of the debt of their deceased father, Teodoro Yulo y Belleza.\u00a0 Nor can they receive any part of their respective lawful portions until the debts of their predecessor in interest, among these the amount demanded, have been paid up to the sum or quantity of their respective portions.\u00a0 Therefore, the adult heirs who with their respective shares in this inheritance may have settled in full the debt claimed, with the interest thereon, are entitled to collect what they have also paid upon the portions that belong to the incompetent Teodoro and the minor Jose, for this is a question of a lawful debt and the obligation that the adult heirs have contracted toward the creditor is undoubtedly valid and effective.<br\/><br\/>The errors assigned to the judgment appealed from are held to be refuted by these considerations, and therefore, with the express declaration that the incompetent Teodoro and the minor Jose Yulo are excluded from this decision, it is proper to affirm, as we hereby do affirm, the judgment appealed from, in all its parts, with the costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Mapa<\/i> and <i>Johnson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">MORELAND, J.,<\/span> with whom concurs Trent, J., <i>concurring<\/i>:<br\/><br\/>I agree to the judgment on the ground that the action is founded on a written agreement made by the heirs, and not on the original debt, under which written agreement neither the incompetent nor the minor is liable. <\/div>",

but this court, without convincing proof, cannot deny to a notarial instrument the validity which the law confers upon it, so long as its falsity or lack of authenticity has not been proven, all which have in no wise been established in the present case.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That the lack of registration of an instrument of sale does riot argue a forgery, because there is no law which requires the registration of an instrument of sale of realty, except in special cases, in none of which can the document in question be comprised.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That the insolvency of a debtor, or the fact that he has many creditors, does not invalidate a sale he may make of his property when it is not definitely burdened with any specific obligation; for so long as the thing sold is not in any way pledged to a merely personal creditor he is not an intervener with respect to the vendor or the vendee to enable him to say that he may be prejudiced by any sale his debtor might have made.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That the vendee did not appear to testify, when the vendor did and hers the person who can and must be examined regarding the deal he originated and who under the law of ejectment could even be compelled so to do in a contrary case, cannot militate in any way against the vendee, when at most it could only be held as a corroboratory circumstance in connection with other evidence in the case, a thing that does not exist herein, where it has been impossible to find any other circumstance; but rather it appears that at the defendant's request the vendee was carefully examined before the justice of the peace prior to the attachment and sale of the realty in question.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That if the transfer had been made without a consideration, then it would be fraudulent or executed in fraud of creditors; but it must be proven, and not merely presumed, that there was no consideration.\u00a0 Nowhere in the case is it shown that there was no consideration, or price paid at the sale, while the vendee testified that he also was a creditor and had urged his debtor to sell him the said lands in payment of what the latter owed him, without prejudice to his continuing to cultivate them on his own account; and nothing to offset these assertions was demonstrated by the defendant during the trial.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That the circumstance which the appellee alleges, of being an acknowledged creditor of the vendor, Catalino Pamtoja, before the instrument of sale was executed, in no way supports the presumption referred to, since a debtor is not prevented from selling his property on account of the existence of previous creditors, if none of the latter prohibit him from so doing.\u00a0 Besides, it appears from the trial record that, if before the sale herein concerned, Claro Palencia was an acknowledged creditor of Catalino Pantoja, the latter made payment with the land which he continued to cultivate in partnership with Palencia, and from\u00a0 this partnership sprang the debt of the products of the cultivation.\u00a0 That acknowledgment does not appear to have existed previous to the sale, since this was effected on the 11th of March, 1909, and until the 25th of the following August the complaint of Palencia against Catalino Pantoja had not been filed, nor until the 3d of September of the same year was an agreement made whereby a settlement was effected of Pantoja's debt to Palencia.<\/li><\/ol>For these reasons the judgment appealed from is reversed, without special findings as to costs, and the trial court shall grant the relief prayed for in the complaint.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur. <\/div>",

Moir, judge, to be imprisoned for a period of one year eight months and twenty-one days of <i>prision correcional<\/i>, to indemnify the offended party, Fermina Ani, in the sum of P500, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, to recognize the offspring as the result of the illicit relations, and to support the same and to pay a pension of P10 per month to the offended party, Fermina Ani, until said offspring shall reach its majority, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>From that sentence the defendant appealed and in this court made the following assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"I. In holding that the accused had carnal knowledge of Fermina Ani.<br\/><br\/>\"II. In classifying as <i>domestic<\/i> the seduction prosecuted in this case.<br\/><br\/>\"III. In holding that deceit was used in the alleged commission of\u00a0 the act under prosecution,<br\/><br\/>\"IV. In rendering a judgment of conviction in the present case.<br\/><br\/>\"V. In fixing the indemnity at P500 for the party said to be offended.<br\/><br\/>\"VI. In applying paragraph 1 of article 443 of the Penal Code to the facts in this\u00a0 case.\"<\/blockquote>We believe that the first, third, and fourth assignments of error may be discussed together.\u00a0 These assignments of error all relate to the sufficiency of the evidence adduced during the trial of the case to show that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged.\u00a0 An examination of the proof shows beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u00a0 in the month of July, 1911, in the municipality of Nueva Caceres, Province of Ambos Camarines, by means of deceit and\u00a0 promises of marriage, did have illicit relations with the said Fermina Ani, a virgin of 17 years of age; that from the result of said illicit relations a child was born to the said Fermina Ani on the 21st of May, 1912.\u00a0 We deem it unnecessary to quote in detail the testimony supporting said fact.<br\/><br\/>Under the fifth assignment of error, the appellant contends that\u00a0 the court erred in allowing the sum of P500 as indemnity to Fermina\u00a0 Ani, the offended party.\u00a0 The lower court evidently took into consideration the social station of the offended party in the community in fixing the said aniount of indemnity.\u00a0 An examination of the record by us fails to show any reason whatever for reducing the said indemnity allowed by the lower court.<br\/><br\/>The second and sixth assignments of error, we think, may also be considered together.\u00a0 They each relate to the qualification of the crime.\u00a0 The first paragraph of article 443 of the Penal Code provides that: <br\/><blockquote>\"The seduction of a virgin over twelve and under twenty-three years of age, committed by any person in public authority, priest, servant, <i>domestic<\/i>, guardian, teacher, or any person who in any capacity shall have charge of the education of the woman seduced, or shall\u00a0 have her under his care, shall be punished by <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum and medium degrees.\"<\/blockquote>It will be noted that this paragraph fixes the penalty imposed upon certain individuals or class of individuals mentioned therein, while the third paragraph of said article (443) provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Any other person<\/i> who by means of deceit shall accomplish the seduction of a woman over twelve and under twenty-three years of age shall suffer the penalty of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>.\"<\/blockquote>The appellant makes the contention that unless the complaint\u00a0 charges that the crime has been committed by the person or class of persons mentioned in said paragraph 1, that the penalty provided for by said section (<i>prision correccional<\/i>) cannot be imposed; that is to say, if the complaint does not specifically charge, for example, that the defendant was a <i>domestic<\/i>, guardian, teacher, etc., that the penalty must be imposed which is provided for \"any other person,\" as found in paragraph 3 of article 443.\u00a0 We believe that the contention of the appellant is tenable.\u00a0 The punishment provided for in paragraph 1 applies only to particular persons or class of persons, and in order to apply said penalty the complaint should be so drawn as to show that the crime was committed by said person or class of persons mentioned therein.\u00a0 While the crime mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 3 is the same, the punishment is different, depending upon the status which the defendant has.\u00a0 In order, therefore, that the defendant in a criminal case for seduction may be punished under paragraph 1 of article 443, the complaint must show that <i>he belongs to the class of persons mentioned therein<\/i>.\u00a0 The fact that the person charged belongs to the class of persons mentioned in the first paragraph of article 443 <i>is a necessary element in the description of the crime<\/i> punished under said paragraph.\u00a0 The complaint in the present case made no reference to the fact that the defendant was a <i>domestic<\/i>, etc.,\u00a0 The proof does show that the defendant lived in the house of the family of the offended party at the time of the commission of the crime.\u00a0 The lower court found that he was a domestic and quoted decisions of the supreme court of Spain in support of his conclusions.\u00a0 Courts cannot, however, increase the grade of a crime in the absence of declarations in the complaint simply because the proofs show that a higher crime has been committed.\u00a0 For example, while homicide and assassination belong to the same class of crimes, nevertheless, if the complaint charges homicide only, the courts cannot convict the defendant of the crime of assassination simply because the proof adduced during the trial of the cause shows facts which would justify the qualification of the crime as that of assassination\u2014the higher offense.<br\/><br\/>For all of the foregoing reasons, we find that the crime committed by the defendant, considering the allegations of the complaint, was the crime described in paragraph 3 of article 443, and not the crime described in paragraph 1 of said article.\u00a0 Therefore the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the lower court must be modified.\u00a0 There were neither aggravating nor extenuating circumstances connected with the commission of the crime.\u00a0 The imprisonment must therefore be in the medium degree of arresto mayor.\u00a0 It is therefore ordered that the defendant and appellant be sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of four months, to indemnify the offended party, Fermina Ani, in the sum of P500, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, to recognize the offspring resulting from said illicit relations, to support the same, to\u00a0 pay a pension of P10 per month to the said offended party until said offspring shall reach the age of majority, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

C. P.)\u00a0\u00a0 The absolute necessity of holding that this contract between the plaintiff and the defendant comes within the statute of frauds is not alone based upon the law above cited, although that alone is sufficiently clear, it seems to us.<br\/><br\/>Section 335 reads\u00a0 as follows:\u00a0 \"In the following cases an\u00a0 agreement hereafter made shall be unenforceable by action unless the same, or some note or memorandum thereof, be in writing, and subscribed by the party charged, or by his agent; evidence, therefore, of the agreement cannot be received without the writing, or secondary evidence of its contents:\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><blockquote>\"5.\u00a0 <i>An agreement for the leasing for a longer period than one year<\/i>, or for the sale of real property, or of an <i>interest therein<\/i>, and such agreement, if made by the agent of the party sought to be charged, is invalid unless the authority of the agent be in writing and subscribed by the party sought to be charged.\"<\/blockquote>Even on the assumption that the complaint only sets forth a contract of subrogation in the rights of Crary as to the portion of the house occupied by Gomez, it seems clear that Gomez acquired a leasehold interest in the real property in question, unless it be argued that a portion of a property cannot be leased to the exclusion of the remainder.\u00a0 So that if he did acquire a leasehold interest in any part of the property, it falls directly within the italicized words of the above quoted section of the code.\u00a0 When we consider the possible, not to say the probable, consequences from holding that a subtenant or other third person may be subrogated in the rights of the tenant whose contract was and of necessity was required to be in writing, without such contract of subrogation\u00a0 being\u00a0 also in writing, there appears to be no ground upon which to base an assertion that such subrogation need not be reduced to writing.\u00a0 The very avenue for fraud which the purpose of the statute is to close would be open to a dishonest lessee by allowing him to subrogate a third person in Ms own right, ould he prove and enforce such a contract without the necessity of reducing it to writing.\u00a0 For these reasons we say that whether the real property acquired by the\u00a0 plaintiff in the contract of subrogation constituted the entire holding of the defendant or only that portion of it which the plaintiff had theretofore occupied as\u00a0 subtenant, is of no importance.\u00a0 In either view of the case the contract is within the statute of frauds.<br\/><br\/>The next\u00a0 assignment of error relates to the fact that there is no allegation in the complaint that the contract of subrogation therein set forth is in writing or that there exists some note or memorandum thereof signed by the defendant.\u00a0 Is such an allegation necessary?<br\/><br\/>In Price <i>vs<\/i>. Weaver (13 Gray, Mass., 272), it was said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The statute of frauds has not altered the rules of pleading, in law or equity.\u00a0 A declaration on a promise which, though oral only, was valid by the common law, may be declared on in the same manner, since the statute, as it might have been before.\u00a0 The writing is matter of proof, and not of allegation.\"<\/blockquote>The principle enunciated in this case is still recognized by the great weight of authority.<br\/><br\/>This court has held in a number of cases, among which are Conlu <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> Araneta (15 Phil. Rep., 387), and Gallemit <i>vs<\/i>. Tabiliran (20 Phil. Rep., 241), that the statute of frauds does not make an oral contract within its terms illegal, but merely voidable at the election of the party sought to be charged, and such election must, of course, be manifested in some affirmative way.\u00a0 While there is no question but that the better practice is to allege that the contract is in writing it is not necessary to the statement of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">prima facie<\/span> cause of action.<br\/><br\/>Can the defense of the statute be raised by demurrer?\u00a0 We think that there should be a presumption in favor of the execution of the writing evidencing the contract, in the absence of allegations in the complaint expressly showing that it was an oral agreement.\u00a0 Paragraph 17 of section 334 of the Code of Civil Procedure establishes the presumption that the ordinary course of business has been followed; and as stated in Printup <i>vs<\/i>. Johnson (19 Ga., 73):<br\/><blockquote>\"If the agreement was such a one that it was required to be in writing by the statute of frauds, then it is to be presumed, until the contrary be shown, that the agreement was in writing; for it is, in general, to be presumed until something to the contrary be shown, that no man does what the law forbids, or what the law declares shall be invalid.\"<br\/><br\/>A late case from the same jurisdiction contains the following further remarks on\u00a0 this subject:\u00a0 \"Where the statute, in derogation of the common law, requires certain contracts to be executed in a prescribed manner in order to be binding upon parties, the law will not presume, in the absence of proof, that either party has violated the statute.\"\u00a0 (Draper, Moore &amp; Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Macon Dry Goods Co., 103 Ga., 661.)<\/blockquote>The rule that the contract is presumed to be in writing when so required by the statute of frauds and not specifically alleged to be\u00a0 in writing by the pleading is supported by many other well-considered cases.\u00a0 (Gale vs. Harp, 64 Ark., 462; Lupean <i>vs<\/i>. Brainard, 46 N. Y. S., 1044; Glayden <i>vs<\/i>. Ellison, 68 S. W., 715, Tex. Civ. App., 1902; Barnsdall <i>vs<\/i>. Waltmayer, 142 P., 415; Bradford Inv. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Joost, 117 Cal., 204; Walker <i>vs<\/i>. Edmundson, 111 Ga., 454; Laybourn <i>vs<\/i>. Zinns, 92 Minn., 208; Speyer <i>vs<\/i>. Desjardins,\u00a0 144 111., 641, 36 A. S. R., 473.)\u00a0 The rule is otherwise in Indiana, but this is due to a\u00a0 statutory enactment.\u00a0 (Horner <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> McConnell, 158 Ind., 280.)<br\/><br\/>As a result\u00a0 of this presumption a pleading which merely fails to show that a contract relied upon is in writing is not susceptible to a demurrer based\u00a0 upon the statute of frauds, for the reason that a demurrer does not even dispute the facts alleged in the pleading to which it is directed, but admits them, together with the\u00a0 legitimate inferences flowing therefrom.\u00a0 That the defense of the statute cannot be raised by demurrer in the face of this presumption of the enforceability of the contract is also a doctrine which receives general assent.\u00a0 (Evans <i>vs<\/i>. Southern R. Co., 133 Ala., 482; Anderson vs. Hilton\u00a0 &amp; D. Lumber Co., 121 Ga., 688; Fowler <i>vs<\/i>. Fowler, 204 III, 82; Phillips <i>vs<\/i>. Hardenburg, 181 Mo., 463; Alexander vs. Cleland, 13 N. M., 524 (1906), 86 P., 425;\u00a0 Matthews <i>vs<\/i>. Matthews, 154 N. Y., 288; Hennings <i>vs<\/i>. Doss, 125 N. C, 400; Tyson <i>vs<\/i>. Jackson\u00a0 Bros., 41 Tex, Civ. App., 128.)<br\/><br\/>Where, however, the pleading shows on its face that the contract relied upon is oral and that it comes within the statute of frauds, the objection of the party sought to be charged may as well be taken by demurrer as by objection to the reception of evidence tending to prove its existence.\u00a0 When such a party proposes to thus offer the defense of the statute, it would prolong the action and subject both litigants to needless expense and waste of time to allow the case to proceed to trial.\u00a0 It would be a mere empty formality which would produce no better or different results than a decision on the demurrer, as in neither case could the contract be enforced.\u00a0 That the defense may be raised by demurrer when the pleading shows on its face that the contract relied upon is oral, is the approved doctrine as is evidenced by the following authorities:\u00a0 Thompson <i>vs<\/i>. New South Coal Co.\u00a0 (135 Ala., 630; 62 L. R. A., 551; 93 A. S. R., 49); Ahrend <i>vs<\/i>. Odiorne (118 Mass., 261; 19 Am. Rep., 449); Seamans <i>vs<\/i>. Barentsen (180 N. Y., 333; 105 A. S. R., 759); International Harvester Co. of America <i>vs<\/i>. Campbell (43 Tex. Civ. App., 421).\u00a0 An exception to this rule is where part performance is relied upon to take the contract out of the statute.\u00a0 (Dicken <i>vs<\/i>. McKinlay, 163 111., 318; 54 A. S. R., 471.)<br\/><br\/>In the present case we find nothing in the complaint which indicates whether the contract relied upon is written or oral, although as stated above it is within the statute of frauds.\u00a0 In accordance with the above remarks relative to the manner of pleading the statute as a defense, it is clear that the demurrer to the complaint should have been overruled.\u00a0 The complaint states a cause of action and the case must proceed to trial.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court sustaining the demurrer to the complaint is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\u00a0 Without costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres<\/i> and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Johnson, J<\/i>., concurs in the result.<br\/><i>Arellano, C.

M. Crary for a period of two years from said date at a monthly rent of P200, which said lease was manifested in a document duly executed and acknowledged before a notary public; that said lease contained no prohibition\u00a0 against subletting.<br\/><br\/>\"That the said tenant, L. M. Crary, in the exercise of his rights under said lease, in the said month of November, 1910, sublet part\u00a0 of the said house to this plaintiff, namely, all of the upper part of said house with its hall, exit, and appurtenances and rights with entry from Calle Azcarraga; that said subletting was for the period of two years from the date of said lease to Crary at a monthly rental of P140 Philippine currency, with free water and sewerage service and with the provision that the installation of electric lights should be at the expense of the said sublessee.<br\/><br\/>\"That on or about the month of February, 1911, the defendant, as owner and proprietor of the said house occupied by the plaintiff, covenanted and\u00a0 agreed with the plaintiff to subrogate him in all the rights and obligations of the said lessor, L. M. Crary, to such an extent that in the future the plaintiff should pay to the defendant the monthly rental, which from said date forward should be reduced to P11O monthly; that the execution of said agreement was duly entered upon, the plaintiff paying to the defendant directly the sum of P110 from that date forward and thereby separating himself completely from his sublessor, L. M. Crary, the plaintiff thereupon becoming' and thereafter being the tenant of the defendant under the same conditions as said L. M. Crary.<br\/><br\/>\"That the defendant since the said agreement of subrogation has repeatedly been requested by the plaintiff to execute in writing before a notary public the said contract of subrogation, and the defendant has each time answered that the plaintiff should not worry because he could occupy the house as long as he desired.<br\/><br\/>\"That by virtue of a judgment of a justice's court rendered in the present month terminating an action for the recovery of possession and rents due in which the present plaintiff was defendant and the present defendant plaintiff, the said defendant in this action notified the plaintiff, Dominador Gomez, that from the month of January, 1912, he must pay a monthly rental of P300 for that part of the house occupied by him, which requirement was in contravention of the continued promises made by the defendant to the plaintiff, and especially in violation of the contract of subrogation between the parties relative to all the rights and obligations of L. M. Crary in favor of the plaintiff, Dominador Gomez.<br\/><br\/>\"Wherefore the plaintiff demands judgment in his favor:<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>a<\/i>) Ordering the defendant to execute in writing before a notary public the contract of lease covenanted and agreed with the\u00a0 plaintiff, said lease to continue as long as this plaintiff desires.\"<\/blockquote>The first feature of this case\u00a0 which attracts attention is what I regard as a misconception on the part of the plaintiff of what actually occurred between the parties when they made the contract set forth in the complaint.\u00a0 The plaintiff alleges that he made an agreement with the\u00a0 defendant in which he, by the aid of the defendant, \"subrogated\" himself to the rights of Crary in a part\u00a0 of the premises which, to plaintiff's knowledge, had already been leased to Crary by the defendant for a period of two years, which period had only just begun to run.\u00a0 It is clear that, under the allegations of the complaint, Crary's rights in the premises were not affected by that agreement.\u00a0 No arrangement between a landlord\u00a0 and a sublessee can prejudice or in any way interfere with the rights of a lessee.\u00a0 Nor could the agreement between plaintiff and defendant disturb the relations between Crary and Gomez created by the contract of sublease.\u00a0 Crary's rights in the premises could not be taken away from him by Gomez or by the landlord or by both.\u00a0 It required some act of his to deprive him of his rights as lessee.\u00a0 None of the elements of subrogation exist.\u00a0 Subrogation is either legal or conventional.\u00a0 The facts set forth do not establish either.\u00a0 The agreement in question did not affect the rights of Crary in the premises.\u00a0 What actually occurred, from defendant's standpoint, was that the defendant sought to lease to the plaintiff a portion of a house the whole of which had already been leased\u00a0 to another person.\u00a0 In other words, it was a second lease of the same premises.\u00a0 From plaintiff's point of view, he, by the contract with defendant, sought to dissolve the ties which, by his sublease, bound him to Crary.\u00a0 That agreement between the plaintiff and defendant took no rights away from Crary and gave none to Gomez.\u00a0 It did not destroy the relation of landlord and tenant existing between Salcedo and Crary; and, when the agreement was completed, the parties, so far as Crary was concerned, were just what they were before.\u00a0 There is no allegation that Crary consented to the arrangement.\u00a0 On the contrary, the complaint and particularly the arguments of counsel on this\u00a0 appeal tend to demonstrate that Crary has maintained and is maintaining the rights which his lease with Salcedo gave him in the premises in question.\u00a0 Specific performance of a contract which appears to be in violation of the rights of third persons will not be decreed.<br\/><br\/>The second interesting feature is that the complaint sets out as the basis of plaintiff's rights <i>one<\/i> contract and asks for the specific performance of <i>another<\/i> and altogether <i>different<\/i> contract, if it can be called a contract at all.<br\/><br\/>It will be observed from the\u00a0 allegations of the\u00a0 complaint that the real contract or lease between the parties provided that the defendant thereby, in November, 1910, leased to the plaintiff, for the period of two years, the upper part of a house which, in the same month and but a short time previously, the defendant had leased to one L. M. Crary for the same period.\u00a0 That is to say, Crary's lease, as well as the lease made between the parties hereto, was for a period of two years from the 8th of November, 1910.\u00a0 This is the lease or \"contract of subrogation,\" set out so fully in plaintiff's complaint, to which he continually refers in his pleading, which, in reality, is the sole basis of his action, and is the only contract as to which there is any consideration.\u00a0 But it is clear from the terms of this \"contract of subrogation\" that the lease-thereby created would continue no longer than November, 1912.\u00a0 This action was commenced on the 29th of December, 1911, the demurrer was filed on the 13th of January, 1912,\u00a0 the decision was rendered on that day, an appeal taken and the bill of exceptions certified on the 17th of February, 1912, and the case was submitted to this court in the month of January, 1913.\u00a0 Therefore, when the case was submitted to this court, the \"contract of subrogation\" had expired by virtue of its terms and, from the allegations of the complaint, had been fully and specifically performed.\u00a0 It needs no argument to demonstrate that specific performance cannot be decreed of a contract which has already expired by its own limitations or which has already been performed.\u00a0 This must have been clear to plaintiff and to his counsel.\u00a0 They knew that an action to perform specifically that contract or to require the execution of a document which would be evidence of that contract would be useless and futile.\u00a0 The plaintiff, accordingly, seems to have abandoned the original contract of lease and to base his action upon\u00a0 another and different contract, if it may be so called.\u00a0 The basis of this alleged lease is a <i>conversation<\/i> which was had between the parties <i>with reference to the \"contract of subrogation.<\/i>\"\u00a0 The plaintiff alleges that he requested the defendant several times to execute a written instrument embodying the parol contract which they had made relative to the rental of the upper part of the house in question or, as he terms it, the \"contract of subrogation.\" In reply to these repeated requests, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant said to him: \"Do not worry, you may occupy the house as long as you desire.\"\u00a0 It is\u00a0 upon this <i>answer<\/i> that this action seems to be based; and the plaintiff is here asking not the specific performance of his \"contract of subrogation\" but the specific performance of <i>an answer which the defendant gave in a conversation in relation to said \"contiact of subrogation<\/i>.\"\u00a0 This would seem to be necessarily the case as the plaintiff is asking for the execution of a written lease granting to him the premises \"as long as the plaintiff desires,\" whereas the term in the \"contract of subrogation,\" or original lease, was two years.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that this answer of the defendant to plaintiff's queries cannot be considered a lease.\u00a0 It lacks many of the essential elements of a lease, among them being a consideration.\u00a0 An action of specific performance will not lie in a relation so indefinite and imperfect.<br\/><br\/>The third feature of the action, which requires notice, is that it seeks to compel the execution of a written instrument embodying a verbal contract, which contract, according to respectable authority, could not itself be specifically performed, whether verbal or in writing.\u00a0 So far as the maintenance of this action is concerned the alleged contract has, according to the authorities referred to, three fatal defects:\u00a0 (1) Its terms are indefinite and\u00a0 uncertain; (2) it lacks mutuality; (3) the contract is determinate at the\u00a0 will of one of the parties.\u00a0 According to its terms, it is to continue only so long as plaintiff wills.\u00a0 It is a well settled rule of law in many jurisdictions that the court will not compel the specific\u00a0 performance\u00a0 of a contract in favor of one of the parties thereto where the same contract could not be specifically enforced by the other.\u00a0 It seems also to be the law in those jurisdictions that the specific performance of a lease will not be decreed where the term for which the lease is to run is indefinite and uncertain.\u00a0 The same courts hold that specific performance will not be decreed where one of the parties may terminate the contract at will or upon notice.\u00a0 In the case of Nelson <i>vs<\/i>. Kelly (91 Ala., 569), it was held that \"an agreement that one may-erect and occupy as long as he desires an office on the land of another is too indefinite to be enforced.\"\u00a0 In the case of Rutland\u00a0 Marble Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Ripley (10 Wall., 339), the court said:\u00a0 \"Another reason why specific performance\u00a0 should not be decreed in this case, is found in the want of mutuality.\u00a0 Such performance by Ripley could not be decreed or enforced at the suit of the Marble\u00a0 Company, for the contract expressly stipulates that he may relinquish the business and abandon the contract at any time on giving one year's notice.\u00a0 And it is a general principle that when\u2014from personal incapacity, the nature of the contract, or any other cause\u2014a contract is incapable of being enforced against one party, that party is equally incapable of enforcing it specifically against the other, though its execution in the latter way might in itself be free from the difficulty attending its execution in the former.\u00a0 (Fry, Spec. Perf., sec. 286.)\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of the Southern Express Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Railroad Company (99 U. S., 191), specific performance of a contract was denied by the court upon the ground that \"the contract stipulates that after the first year it shall cease upon the payment of the $20,000 and interest.\u00a0 This might be made immediately upon the rendition of the decree.\u00a0 The action of the court would thus become a nullity.\"\u00a0 It is broadly stated in that case that \"a court of equity never interferes where the power of revocation exists.\"\u00a0 (Fry, Spec. Perf., 64.) In the case of Solomon <i>vs<\/i>. Wilmington Sewerage Co. (55 S. E., 300), the action was brought to restrain the defendant from disconnecting plaintiffs' residences from the main sewer pipe of the\u00a0 defendant company and for the specific performance of a contract on the part of the defendant company in which it had agreed to furnish the plaintiffs sewerage connection <i>as long as they desired<\/i>.\u00a0 In that case the court said:\u00a0 \"The uncertainty in this contract is in respect to its duration.\u00a0 How long shall the plaintiffs enjoy the right to use the sewer pipe of the defendant company?<br\/><br\/>They say:\u00a0 As long as they please, even to the life of the company, by paying the annual dues.\"<br\/><br\/>Considering this question the court said: \"Again, how would it be possible for a court of equity to supervise and enforce the performance of its decree\u00a0 during so long a period?\"\u00a0 And after discussing the case, reached this conclusion: \"In this view of the\u00a0 case, we simply hold that, by reason of its uncertainty in\u00a0 respect to time, specific performance will not be decreed.\"<br\/><br\/>Speaking of another objection to specific performance, the court said:\u00a0 \"In regard to the second objection urged by defendant, we find the rule laid down by courts of equity to be that a contract which is not mutual\u2014that is, in which both parties are not and cannot be bound by the decree\u2014will not be specifically enforced.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 (Ten Eyck <i>vs<\/i>. Manning, 52 N. J. Eq., 47; Beard <i>vs<\/i>. Linthicum, 1 Md. Ch., 345; Duval <i>vs<\/i>. Myers, 2 Md. Ch., 401; Woodruff <i>vs<\/i>. Woodruff, 44 N. J. Eq., 349.)\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Shields <i>vs<\/i>. Trammel] (19\u00a0 Ark., 51), the court said that \"what is meant by mutuality of remedy is that the contract must be of such a nature that performance on both sides can be judicially secured.\u00a0 (Kolachny <i>vs<\/i>. Galbreath, 26 Okla., 772.)\"<br\/><br\/>It is clear from the complaint in this case that the action suffers from all of the defects pointed out in the foregoing decisions.\u00a0 According to the law as laid down therein, courts will not decree the specific performance of a contract when one of the parties may at his will terminate it and thus render null the decree of the court.\u00a0 The decree might become operative one moment\u00a0 and\u00a0 the revocation of the contract and, in consequence, the nullification of the decree might occur the next, the continuation of said contract and all rights thereunder being wholly subject to the will of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>I express no opinion about the soundness of the propositions laid down in the cases above\u00a0 cited.\u00a0 I simply call attention to them as having a strong bearing on this case and as presenting questions seriously important in this case to which the decision does not even refer.\u00a0 In the same way I desire to call attention, without expressing a definite opinion in relation thereto, to the following point:<br\/><br\/>The fourth interesting feature is that the parties and the decision of the court entirely overlook the provisions of the Civil Code and the decisions of this court (article 1128 of the Civil Code; Eleizegui <i>vs<\/i>. Manila Lawn Tennis Club, 2 Phil. Rep., 309; Levy Hermanos <i>vs<\/i>. Paterno, 18 Phil. Rep., 353; Seoane <i>vs<\/i>. Franco, 24 Phil. Rep., 309) which declare that where the time for the performance of an obligation has been left to the will of one of the parties, the obligation is not enforceable until the court has, in an appropriate action, fixed the date on which the obligation is due.\u00a0 From these decisions may it be deduced that, until this court has fixed the term during which the alleged lease must run, specific performance thereof cannot be had because, as a matter of law, no one can say prior to that time what the term of the lease is?\u00a0 It is not a sufficient reply to this question to say that the term of the lease may be fixed in the present action.\u00a0 The action is not properly brought for that purpose, the facts are not stated in the complaint in a way to warrant such relief, nor does the plaintiff, and especially the defendant, ask for such a remedy.\u00a0 That matter was not brought to the attention of the lower court and has not been presented or argued in this.\u00a0 May it be said, therefore, that specific performance can be decreed in this action at this time?\u00a0 Or will it be impossible until the term for which the lease is to run has been fixed by competent authority?<br\/><br\/>If these questions are answered in the affirmative, the discussion\u00a0 relative to the application of the statute of frauds, as it appears in the decision, is premature.\u00a0 Until the term of the lease is fixed and known, it cannot be said whether the lease will fall within the statute of frauds or not, because if the lease is for a year or less, the statute of frauds does not apply.\u00a0 If, therefore, the court should hold,\u00a0 in an action by Salcedo to fix the term of the lease, that the lease was for one month (Civil Code, art. 1581), it is clear that the statute of frauds would be eliminated from consideration.<br\/><br\/>As a necessary conclusion, the decision of the court does not\u00a0 contain facts sufficient to sustain its conclusions of law and the application of the law to such facts as there are, is wrong.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons I dissent.\u00a0 I cannot believe that the facts stated in the complaint warrant a court in granting the relief prayed for.\u00a0 The judgment should be affirmed.<\/div>",

MODESTO MACUTI, FLORENTINO MACUTI, AGATON MACUTI, JUAN GELLADUGA, DONATO GELLADUGA, AND ANTONIO GELLADUGA, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The six defendants in this case were convicted of the crime of homicide, and with the exception of Modesto Macuti, were sentenced\u00a0 to fourteen years eight months and one day of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i>, Modesto Macuti, being only sixteen years of age, was sentenced to six years and one day of <i>presidio mayor<\/i>.\u00a0 From this judgment all appealed; but during the pendency of the case in this court Modesto Macuti withdrew his appeal, which leaves for our consideration only the case made against the remaining five defendants.<br\/><br\/>Antonia Maglonob, the wife of the deceased Martino Jalea, testified that all six of the defendants arrived at their house on the evening of February 18, while her husband was working on a cart which he was repairing.\u00a0 After finishing his work on the cart the Gelladugas entered the house and drank some <i>tuba<\/i> with her husband, the Macutis remaining outside.\u00a0 After drinking the <i>tuba<\/i> Juan Gelladuga invited Martino to accompany them to another place which he did not name to drink some more <i>tuba<\/i>.\u00a0 To this Martino assented and all the accused and Martino then left the house.<br\/><br\/>Isidoro Ariguin, the only witness for the prosecution who saw the fight, testified that this same crowd came to his house that night after prayer time.\u00a0 Florentino Macuti had been there that morning and saw a bottle of <i>vino<\/i>.which he had prepared for his sick wife, and that was the reason Florentino returned that evening with his friends.\u00a0 His visitors were all intoxicated, and as they were very noisy and looked quarrelsome, he gave them the bottle of <i>vino<\/i> and requested them to leave the house because of his sick wife.\u00a0 This they did, but just after leaving the house Agaton Macuti and the deceased began fighting.\u00a0 Florentino Macuti interposed and took a stick away from the deceased.\u00a0 This defendant was the first one to hit the deceased.\u00a0 In response to the question, \"Who beat him?\" witness replied, \"They beat him [naming and pointing out each of the six defendants] and they were his companions.\"\u00a0 But later in his testimony, after giving the account of the struggle between Agaton and Florentino Macuti on the one side and Jalea on the other for the possession of the stick, he was asked specifically what Juan Gelladuga was doing while Florentino Macuti and Jalea\u00a0 were fighting, to which he merely replied that he was downstairs.\u00a0 He gave the same answer on being asked what Donato and Antonio Gelladuga were doing.\u00a0 Although at the beginning of his testimony this witness stated that all of the defendants beat Jalea, it will be noted that in his detailed account of the actions of his guests after they left his house and up to the time he saw them all gathered around the deceased, he only mentions two persons as engaged in, the fight with the deceased, they being Florentino and Agaton Macuti.\u00a0 In answer to a direct question as to what the three Gelladugas were doing, this witness merely stated that they were downstairs.\u00a0 Again, this witness stated positively that he did not see who <i>wounded<\/i> the deceased, but only heard Jalea cry out, \"Help me, because Modesto\u00a0 has wounded me,\" and on running downstairs, saw Jalea covered with blood.\u00a0 This testimony does not by any means produce \"an abiding conviction beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the three Gelladugas engaged in the struggle for the possession of the stick or inflicted any of the knife wounds.\u00a0 On hearing Jalea's cry for help and going downstairs, he found all the defendants surrounding Jalea, who was standing\u00a0 up, but he did not know if they were inflicting punishment on him or assisting him.\u00a0 On seeing Jalea covered with blood he became frightened and retired to his house.\u00a0 Florentino Macuti wanted to come up into his house, but witness had already shut the door and refused to open it, whereupon Florentino told him that there was a dead man in the cornfield.\u00a0 Witness replied to Florentino, \"You have killed this man and you will have to be responsible for it.\"\u00a0 After shutting up his\u00a0 house, witness opened the window a little, and looking out, saw Modesto and Agaton Macuti tie a rope around the arms, the\u00a0 waist, and the knees of the deceased; and then the accused carried him away by means of three bamboo sticks about 6 or 7 feet in length.\u00a0 The moon was shining, so that he could see these occurrences plainly.<br\/><br\/>Valentin Altana, merchant, testified that he had just arrived at his home from his place of business on the night in question and was resting on the steps of his house when he heard Jalea cry out,\u00a0 \"Help me, Modesto Macuti has wounded me.\"\u00a0 He recognized Jalea's voice because he had known the deceased a long time.\u00a0 On running to see what was the matter he saw that Jalea's stomach was bloody and that he was standing up surrounded by all of the defendants.\u00a0 He did not see any of the defendants strike Jalea.\u00a0 On seeing that Jalea was wounded, he ran back to his home because he was afraid. His home was about 50 <i>brazas<\/i> and Isidoro Ariguin's house was about 10 <i>brazas<\/i> from the scene of the trouble.\u00a0 He approached to within about 5 <i>brazas<\/i> of the defendants and could recognize them because the moon was shining brightly.\u00a0 He had known all of the defendants a long time.<br\/><br\/>Manuel Balabaran testified that his house was only about 1 <i>braza<\/i> from Ariguin's house.\u00a0 He was well acquainted with all the accused and the deceased.\u00a0 On the night in question, after prayers, he heard Martino cry out, \"Help me, because Modesto has wounded me;\" and he immediately shut his house up as he was afraid and because his wife had just given birth to a child.<br\/><br\/>Clemente Jalea, brother of the deceased, stated that he found the body of his brother buried in the mud in a small creek called Salong, about 400 <i>brazas<\/i> from Ariguin's house.\u00a0 He found a rope tied around his brother's stomach, and two bamboo sticks near it, and a little farther away another bamboo stick.\u00a0 These sticks and rope were introduced in evidence without objection.\u00a0 The certificate of the president of the municipal board of health was also introduced without objection which showed that there were eight wounds on the body of the deceased, seven of which would have healed in seven days with medical attention, while the eighth had penetrated the heart, producing death.<br\/><br\/>The defense introduced two of the accused, Modesto Macuti and Juan Gelladuga.\u00a0 With some variations and omitting details, the testimony of these two defendants was that Jalea wanted to go back\u00a0 into the house to fight with a mountain man with whom he had started a quarrel; that Florentino tried to prevent him and grabbed a stick which Jalea was carrying.\u00a0 In the struggle for the possession of the stick Florentino fell to the ground and Jalea commenced beating him, whereupon Modesto approached and ordered Jalea to let his father alone.\u00a0 Jalea then turned on Modesto and struck him a blow with the club which stunned Modesto.\u00a0 While in this dazed condition, Modesto drew his penknife and wounded Jalea.\u00a0 Modesto further testified that he returned to the scene of the fight later on in the night when it was very still to see if he had really killed Martino. Isidoro Ariguin saw him and made him go and get his (Modesto's) father's cart and carabao.\u00a0 They placed the body on the cart and took it to the creek where Ariguin took hold of the feet and pulled the body off the cart and buried it in the mud.\u00a0 Ariguin then ordered him to wash the blood off the cart, after which they returned to Ariguin's house.\u00a0 By Ariguin's orders he then placed leaves over the spot where the deceased had fallen and Ariguin set them on fire, after which witness returned to his own home.<br\/><br\/>Called in rebuttal, Isidoro Ariguin denied that he had assisted Modesto in burying the body or that there had been any quarrel between Jalea and the mountain man.<br\/><br\/>The trial court characterized the testimony of Modesto as manufactured for the purpose of shielding the other guilty persons, and that of Juan Gelladuga as utterly unreliable.\u00a0 There is direct conflict between the evidence for the prosecution and the evidence for the defense in many particulars, and the credibility of the witnesses was for the lower court to determine.\u00a0 Under the circumstances of this case, there is nothing which would warrant us in saying that the lower court erred in accepting the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution as true and in declining to believe the witnesses for the defense.<br\/><br\/>But we see no reason, however, for not accepting their testimony where it is corroborated by the testimony for the prosecution.\u00a0 As to the struggle for the possession of the stick which Jalea carried, the two defendants tell substantially the same story as does Ariguin.\u00a0 There\u00a0 is nothing in the record which implicates the three Gelladugas in any way in this contest.\u00a0 Again, the confession of Modesto that he wounded the deceased is corroborated by the declaration of the deceased (which must be considered as part of the <i>res gest<\/i>\u00e6, and which was\u00a0 heard by three of the witnesses for the prosecution) that Modesto was the one who wounded him.\u00a0 The deceased was certainly in a much better position to see who wounded him than anyone else.\u00a0 Had all the defendants or even three or four of them set upon him with knives, it is hardly probable that he would call out only one of their names.\u00a0 Rather, he would indicate that a number were attacking him with knives.\u00a0 We have carefully examined the testimony of Modesto and fail to find any justification for the statement of the trial court in its decision that he testified that he wounded Jalea only once.\u00a0 We find him saying in one place that he inflicted <i>wounds<\/i> on the deceased, and again that he did not know how many times he struck the deceased with his knife because he was in a dazed condition.\u00a0 In another place we find him answering questions propounded by the fiscal in which the latter refers to the <i>first<\/i> wound he inflicted upon Jalea.<br\/><br\/>Ariguin, the principal witness for the prosecution, describes the fight for the possession of the stick as being between Jalea and the two Macutis, Florentino and Agaton, He does not implicate any one of the Gelladugas in this fight, and further says that he did not see who wounded the deceased.\u00a0 The deceased cried out that Modesto wounded him, and this is confirmed by the confession of Modesto himself.\u00a0 The fact that all six of the defendants gathered around the deceased immediately after he was wounded does not tend to show that they all participated in the fight.\u00a0 Altana evidently arrived on the scene at about the same time as Ariguin, since both were prompted to come by Jalea's cry for help and both found him standing surrounded by the six accused, Ariguin saying that he could not tell whether they were inflicting punishment on the deceased or not, and Altana saying positively that they were not doing him harm.\u00a0 Indeed, not the slightest motive for the Gelladugas attacking the deceased can be divined from the evidence of record.\u00a0 The three Macutis, on the other hand, by reason of their kinship, might be expected to assist each other.\u00a0 This, we think, is what happened.\u00a0 Far from any indication that there was any enmity existing between any of the members of this party, the testimony of all the witnesses, both for the prosecution and for the defense, so far as it touches upon the point, is that all the parties concerned were good friends up to the time of the fight.\u00a0 There is no indication even that as they were leaving the house there was any ill feeling or resentment between the deceased and any one of the accused persons.\u00a0 The fight having occurred immediately after leaving the house, there could hardly have been time for the six accused to formulate a conspiracy to effect the death of Martino.<br\/><br\/>In United States <i>vs<\/i>. Guevara (2 Phil. Rep., 528), it was held that the mere presence of the defendant at the time and place of the commission of the crime, is not of itself sufficient to show such an act of simultaneous cooperation as to make such a defendant an accessary to the crime.\u00a0 In United States <i>vs<\/i>. Cabonce (11 Phil. Rep., 169), which also affirmed this doctrine, it was added that even though doubt might exist as to the innocence of Simon Cabonce (one of the defendants) on account of certain data which appeared in the record, that was not sufficient to warrant a finding of guilt under the provisions of section 57 of General Orders, No. 58, which provides that a defendant in a criminal case shall be presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved, and that his guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 The case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Locson (20 Phil. Rep., 516), also affirms this doctrine.<br\/><br\/>The facts of the case at bar, as to the Gelladugas, are within the doctrine enunciated in the above cited cases of this court, and they must for that reason alone be acquitted of direct participation in the crime.<br\/><br\/>Assuming that Florentino and Agaton Macuti were fighting with Jalea at the time Modesto Macuti stabbed him,can they be held responsible as principals?\u00a0 We have already stated that the record shows no prearranged plan to kill the deceased.\u00a0 It has been the constant holding, not only of this court, but also of the supreme court of Spain, that in the absence of a previous plan or agreement to commit a crime the criminal responsibility arising from different acts directed against one and the same person is individual and not collective, and that each of the participants is liable only for the acts committed by\u00a0 himself.<br\/><br\/>In United States <i>vs<\/i>. Magcomot (13 Phil. Rep., 386), two of the defendants (brothers) were quarrelling with the deceased, when their father suddenly appeared and without warning to anyone inflicted a death blow upon the deceased.\u00a0 This was the only blow struck.\u00a0 The lower court sentenced the father and one brother to life imprisonment and the other brother, who was under eighteen years of age, received a penalty of seventeen years and four months.\u00a0 On appeal this\u00a0 court, after reviewing the authorities, acquitted the two brothers upon the ground that there had been no concerted action between them and their father to inflict the fatal blow, and that this lack of concerted action made each of the defendants liable for only those acts he himself committed\u00a0 against the deceased.<br\/><br\/>In United States <i>vs<\/i>. Manayao (4 Phil. Rep., 293), it appears that Simeon Manayao and one Margarejo, who were rivals in a love affair, had a quarrel in a store in which a number of friends of each took sides.\u00a0 After leaving the store and while on their way home the quarrel was renewed between the defendant Simeon and his brother on one side, and Margarejo and a friend on the other.\u00a0 Finally the parties came to blows and Simeon stabbed Margarejo with a knife with fatal results.\u00a0 This was the only wound inflicted upon the deceased and the evidence failing to show concerted action on the part of the defendants in the use of the knife or the infliction of the blow, or that the brother of Simeon\u00a0 had any reason to believe that the latter was intending to make a deadly assault on the deceased, Simeon alone was held responsible for the crime and his brother acquitted.<br\/><br\/>In United States <i>vs<\/i>. Reyes (14 Phil. Rep., 27), Javier and Legaspi were having a quarrel in which Legaspi was using a club.\u00a0 While Javier was holding Legaspi in such a manner as to prevent him from using the club with much effect, Reyes intervened as peacemaker and was struck on the arm with the club by Legaspi.\u00a0 This so enraged Reyes that he wrested the club from the hands of Legaspi and struck the latter two fatal blows on the head with the club, this while Javier was still holding Legaspi in such a manner that Reyes was permitted to strike the fatal blows without serious hindrance on the part of Legaspi.\u00a0 This court held on appeal that there was no concerted action between Reyes and Javier to cause the death of the deceased and Javier was therefore acquitted.<br\/><br\/>In United States <i>vs<\/i>. Lagora et al.\u00a0 (R. G. No. 8148, not reported), it appears that Teofila Lagora left her father's home for the second time in order to live with the deceased Santiago Morales.\u00a0 Her father, accompanied by his son Tomas, both armed with bolos and clubs, went to the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sitio<\/span> of Bonot and met the other defendants Canuto Arong and Irineo Alcantara who were likewise armed with bolos.\u00a0 Benito Lagora, the father of the girl, immediately inquired where his daughter was, and on being informed that she was hiding in the field near the house he went to the place where she was.\u00a0 Benito started to administer physical punishment to his daughter when the deceased Santiago Morales ran to her aid and placed himself between her and her father in order to ward off the assault.\u00a0 The father pushed him and he fell to the ground face upward on top of Teofila who was at that moment behind him.\u00a0 Just as soon as Santiago fell Benito jumped upon him\u00a0 and\u00a0 caught him by the neck and almost at the same time the defendants Canuto Arong and Irineo Alcantara also came up and seized both of Santiago's hands.\u00a0 While Santiago was in this position and unable to defend himself Tomas Lagora suddenly stabbed him with the bolo he was carrying.\u00a0 The lower court held all four of the defendants guilty as principals.\u00a0 In acquitting all the defendants with the exception of Tomas Lagora of the crime charged this court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The fact that all four of the appellants were armed with bolos does not show that they had intended to kill the deceased or to do him any injury, as none except Tomas even attempted to use their weapons, although they had every opportunity to do so.\u00a0 Under these circumstances, the three codefendants of Tomas Lagora can not be held responsible for his own acts.\"<\/blockquote>Under the doctrine of these cases, Florentino and Agaton Macuti must be absolved from any responsibility for the killing of Martino Jalea.<br\/><br\/>There remains to be considered the evidence as to the burial of the body.\u00a0 As to this the Attorney-General states that the evidence only shows Modesto and Agaton Macuti to have been implicated in carrying the body to the creek and burying it in the mud; and therefore asks that Agaton be convicted as\u00a0 an <i>encubridor<\/i>, while the remaining four appellants be acquitted.\u00a0 We are of the opinion, however, that the evidence shows all six of the accused to have assisted in hiding the body.\u00a0 The only direct testimony offered by the prosecution upon this point is that of Isidoro Ariguin.\u00a0 He testified\u00a0 as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Who carried him off?\u2014A. Agaton and Modesto were those who carried the body afterwards.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Look at these objects which I present you [showing to witness three bamboo sticks and a rope\u2014sticks about 6 or 7 feet in length and between 2 and 3 inches in thickness\u2014bamboo poles cut off] and state if you know them.\u2014A. These are only pieces of bamboo to indicate the manner in which the accused carried the deceased.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. And the rope which we will mark as Exhibit A\u2014do you know this?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\u00a0 That is the rope with which they tied the corpse.\u00a0 This is the rope that they had tied around the stomach of Martino Jalea.\u00a0 They went to a place that is called Catlagan and in a small creek there they buried the corpse.\u00a0 This creek is in the barrio of Solong and to this place the accused went.\" <\/blockquote>Again, on being asked if he later saw the body of the deceased, this witness replied that he did not, for the reason that the accused took him away.\u00a0 The word <i>accused<\/i> appears in the testimony of this witness in several places, and always indicates that he referred to all of the defendants collectively.\u00a0 In addition to this, we have the testimony of the brother of the deceased that three bamboo sticks were found near the body.\u00a0 A rope was tied in three places around the body, three bamboo sticks were used in carrying the body, and the only explanation is that these sticks were inserted between the body and the rope, one underneath the arms, one around the waist, and one at the knees, and that two of the accused carried each one of these sticks in the same manner as <i>pingas<\/i> are used in this country to carry burdens.\u00a0 It is not reasonable to suppose that if only two of the accused carried the body away they would use three bamboo sticks each six or seven feet in length. Again, <i>the accused<\/i> were all six of the defendants.\u00a0 Several times in his declaration this witness uses this term without qualification whatever.\u00a0 It is\u00a0 true that he mentioned Modesto and Agaton Macuti as the ones who tied the rope around the body and, in answer to the question, \"Who carried him off?\" replied that these two were the ones.\u00a0 But his answer to the very next question modifies his answer to the preceding question.\u00a0 The trial court interpreted the testimony of this witness to mean that all six of the accused assisted in carrying the body away.<br\/><br\/>In Ware <i>vs<\/i>. Stephenson (10 Leigh (Va.), 155, 165), the court said:\u00a0 \"In ascertaining the facts established by it, we must look to all of it, and especially in ascertaining the facts established by any one witness, everything stated by him, as well on his cross-examination as on his examination in chief, must be considered.\u00a0 Facts imperfectly stated in answer to one question may be supplied by his answer to another; and when from one statement considered by itself an inference may be deduced, that inference may be strengthened or repelled by the facts disclosed in another.\"<br\/><br\/>Such was the rule stated by the court in Bruch <i>vs<\/i>. Philadelpia (181 Pa., 588), where the testimony of the plaintiff could be construed to\u00a0 show that he was exercising ordinary care or that he had been guilty of contributory negligence, the court said; \"While we will not undertake to say the interpretation put upon plaintiff's testimony by the learned judge of the court below was clearly a wrong one, we are of the opinion it was not clearly the only one of which it was susceptible, arid was not clearly the right one; hence, the evidence would have been for the jury if that method of trial had been adopted; and the referee having been substituted for the jury, his finding of fact is conclusive on defendant.\"<br\/><br\/>In Mexican Cent Ry. Co. vs. Henderson (114 Fed., 892), where a similar question was presented to the court for consideration, it was said:\u00a0 \"The jury had the witness before them.\u00a0 His testimony was expressed to them not alone in arbitrary characters which constitute the words he used, but also by his manner in their use.\u00a0 Whatever may be the fact, it does not unquestionably appear on the surface of the language in which his testimony is reported to us that he thought, or that he intended to admit, or believe that he was admitting, that he had not done, on the morning he started out with his engine, all that his duty as an engineer and the rules and practice of the company required him\u00a0 to do to satisfy himself that the step in question was in condition for use.\"<br\/><br\/>In People <i>vs<\/i>. Wallace (109 Cal., 611), which was an action for seduction, the prosecuting witness testified that she did not consent to sexual intercourse and the defense therefore claimed that it was a case of rape and not of seduction.\u00a0 But the supreme court held that she intended to convey the meaning by these words that she did not consent in terms because she did not think it was right, but yielded to the persuasions of the defendant.\u00a0 \"The jury very properly subordinated the literal terms used by the witness to the substance and effect of her evidence.\"<br\/><br\/>The emphasis, gesture, and inflection of the voice are potent aids\u00a0 in understanding the testimony of witnesses.\u00a0 The trial court has the opportunity and is presumed to take advantage of these aids in weighing the testimony of the witnesses.\u00a0 But as they cannot be incorporated into the record, this court has no such assistance in the examination of the testimony and we must therefore rely upon the good judgment of the lower court.\u00a0 In this case the interpretation placed upon the testimony of the witnesses by the trial court appears the most reasonable and probable from the record itself.\u00a0 Certainly, we would not be justified in reversing a finding of fact made by the lower court under these conditions.<br\/><br\/>These defendants having participated in the burial of the deceased with full knowledge of the commission of the crime, and having neglected to inform the authorities of the facts known to them, the case as to them is directly within the doctrine of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Leal (1 Phil. Rep., 118); see also United States <i>vs<\/i>. Romulo (15 Phil. Rep., 408).<br\/><br\/>We therefore conclude that the five appellants did not directly participate in the commission of the crime and their conviction of the crime of homicide cannot be sustained by the evidence of record.\u00a0 The judgment of the lower court sentencing them for that crime is therefore set aside.\u00a0 The evidence does show, however, that they assisted in concealing the body, and they are therefore guilty, under the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 15 of the Penal Code, as <i>encubridores<\/i>. In accordance with article 68 the penalty inflicted should be two degrees lower than that provided for the consummated crime, which, in\u00a0 this case, is <i>prision correccional<\/i><br\/><br\/>The record shows that these appellants were intoxicated at the time the crime was committed.\u00a0 This is a mitigating circumstance under paragraph 6 of article 9 of the Penal Code, except when\u00a0 the intoxication is\u00a0 habitual.\u00a0 When the record is silent as to whether the intoxication is habitual or not, as is the record in this case, the accused will be favored with the presumption that his intoxication is not habitual.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Fitzgerald, 2\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 419; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Dayutal, 4 Phil. Rep., 93; U. S.\u00a0 <i>vs<\/i>. Highfill, 4 Phil. Rep., 384.)\u00a0 The intoxication of the five appellants must therefore be considered as a mitigating circumstance, and there being no aggravating circumstances, the penalty should be applied in its\u00a0 minimum degree.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, we hereby sentence each of the five appellants, Florentino Macuti, Juan Gelladuga, Donato Gelladuga, Antonio Gelladuga, and Agaton Macuti to two years of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, together with the corresponding accessory penalties; to indemnify the heirs of the deceased jointly and severally in the sum of Pl,000, and to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency (this liability being contingent upon the insolvency of the principal, Penal Code, art. 125); and to the payment of one-sixth of the costs of the cause.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

while the defendant undertook to show by his witnesses that he had inherited the plot of ground in question from his mother and had held it in quiet and undisputed possession for more than ten years.<br\/><br\/>The lower court held that the plaintiff had failed to establish his title, and dismissed the complaint with costs against him.\u00a0 The record conclusively establishes that Juan Pascual, from whom plaintiff claims to have purchased the ground, died on August 16, 1906.\u00a0 Exhibit A of the plaintiff purports to be a deed of sale executed by Juan Pascual on June 15, 1906, for a consideration of P50.\u00a0 This deed is a private document and is\u00a0 signed by Pascual and five witnesses.\u00a0 The boundary owners of the land in question in this action as set forth by some of the witnesses are not wholly identical with those set forth is this deed, but there appears to be no dispute as to the actual location of the land, and the differences in the names of the boundary owners may be sufficiently accounted for by the fact that some of the adjacent landowners appear to have changed since the execution of the deed.<br\/><br\/>Two of the witnesses who signed the deed bore the name of Agustin.\u00a0 One of these witnesses was the husband of Bonifacia Cabacungan, and was not living at the time of the trial.\u00a0 The other witnesses,\u00a0 Agustin Agustin, Rufino Agustin, Bonifacia Cabacungan, and Epitacio Agustin, the plaintiff, all testified as to the execution\u00a0 of the deed, and from their testimony it appears that the plaintiff from the date of its execution was in undisputed possession of the land in question until about a year prior to the institution of this action, when the defendant entered on the land and destroyed the plaintiff's corral.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge in his opinion observes that some of these witnesses involved themselves in contradictions, and that for that reason he was inclined to doubt the authenticity of the deed.\u00a0 We have examined the testimony of these witnesses carefully, and while they are not in absolute accord on all points, we have failed to discover such inconsistencies or contradictions in their testimony as would justify the inference that the whole story of the execution of the deed as related by them is false, and that in truth the deed had been executed and witnessed several years after the death of the vendor as is claimed by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>In support of the contention of the defendant in this regard but one witness was called.\u00a0 This man, Timoteo Dumlao, testifying for the defendant, asserted that he had drafted the document in question, but that he had done so in the month of June of the year 1911.\u00a0 He asserted that he had written the document in the house of one Luciano Segundo at the instance of the plaintiff, but that he had not taken part in its final execution because he left the house after the witnesses had assembled there, having no further interest in the transaction.\u00a0 If we accept the testimony of this witness we must believe that the alleged deed was a forged instrument, and that all the witnesses whose signatures are attached thereto had deliberately conspired together with the plaintiff for its fraudulent execution.\u00a0 The story of his connection with the transaction as told by this witness is highly unsatisfactory, and if it can be believed it conclusively establishes that he himself was a party to the conspiracy to execute a fictitious document of sale of a piece of land worth about P50 in which no less than seven persons took part.\u00a0 Two of the witnesses to the deed appear to be heirs of Pascual, and in testifying as to the execution of the deed they were testifying against their own interest.\u00a0 Examining the testimony of these witnesses, as found in the record of this case, we do not believe there is room for any real doubt that the witness called for the defense deliberately and maliciously attempted to make it appear that he prepared the draft of the deed long after the death of the vendor, for no other purpose than to defeat the claim of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The defendant undertook to show that he had inherited the land in question from his mother, and had been in possession of it for more than ten years; but there is no evidence in the record sufficient to sustain a finding that defendant had exercised any act of dominion or ownership over the land for any length of time, and indeed the defendant failed utterly to establish the title of his mother or the fact that he had occupied the land at any time prior to the date when he entered it unlawfully as alleged in the complaint.\u00a0 The evidence to our minds clearly establishes the fact that, prior to his death in 1906, Juan Pascual was the owner\u00a0 of this plot of land and lived upon it, and by the defendant's own witnesses it appears that plaintiff had a corral for his animals located on the land for a period of nearly two years before the date when it is alleged the defendant entered on the land and destroyed the corral.<br\/><br\/>Defendant claimed that he had paid the taxes upon the land and that it had been assessed in his name, and in support of this contention introduced a tax declaration and some tax receipts.\u00a0 It appears that defendant is the owner of a parcel of land immediately adjoining the lot in question, and while the proof is not conclusive upon this point, we are well satisfied that the tax declaration and tax receipts introduced by the defendant have reference to this adjacent lot owned by him, and do not include the lot in question.<br\/><br\/>Upon the whole record we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and that judgment for possession should be entered in favor of the plaintiff as prayed for in his complaint, but without damages, the evidence of record not being sufficient to establish the amount thereof.<br\/><br\/>We think, furthermore, that the evidence sufficiently discloses the lack of good faith on the part of the defendant in taking possession of this parcel of land and in destroying the corral of the plaintiff, and that he is not, therefore, entitled to any compensation or allowance on account of the little nipa shack which it appears he has constructed on the land.<br\/><br\/>So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

G., No. 8449)<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>, applied to the facts developed by the evidence in this case, leads inevitably to the conclusion that the defendant and appellant is guilty of setting fire to and destroying a nipa shack, the property of the complaining witness, worth about P60, by setting out a fire, with reckless negligence, in his own ricefield, at a time when a high wind was blowing, which carried the fire from the field of the defendant to the shack.<br\/><br\/>But while a judgment of conviction must be sustained, we think that the penalty imposed should be modified.\u00a0 Article 568 (Penal Code), defining and penalizing the offense, is as follows:\u00a0 \"Any person who by reckless imprudence shall commit any act which, had it been intentional, would constitute a grave felony shall suffer a penalty ranging from <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its maximum degree to <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum degree; if it would have constituted a less grave felony, the penalty of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its minimum and medium degrees shall be imposed.\"<br\/><br\/>Under the provisions of this article.the penalty prescribed for the offense committed ranges from <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its maximum degree to <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum degree.\u00a0 The trial judge having found that none of the aggravating or extenuating circumstances set forth in the first book of the Code marked the commission of the offense, imposed the minimum of the medium degree of this penalty, that is to say, one year and one day of <i>prision correccional<\/i>.\u00a0 From a reading of his judgment we would infer that he, like ourselves, had arrived at the conclusion that under all the circumstances of this case the interests of justice would not demand the imposition of anything more than the minimum penalty prescribed by law, but that he overlooked the authority conferred upon him to waive the ordinary rules in imposing penalties in this class of cases.\u00a0 Article 568, after defining and penalizing the offense, further provides that \"in the application of these penalties the courts shall act upon their own discretion without subjection to the rule established by\u00a0 article 81,\" that is to say, without the obligation of imposing the penalty in its minimum, medium or maximum degree according as the proof adduced at the trial establishes the existence or nonexistence of the aggravating and extenuating circumstances mentioned in the first book of the Code.<br\/><br\/>As we have said, the penalty prescribed for the offense of which the defendant and appellant was convicted is that of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its maximum degree to <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum degree, or from four months and one day of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> to two years and four months of <i>prision correccional<\/i>.\u00a0 We think that the minimum penalty, that is to say, four months and one day of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>, together with the provision requiring the payment of the value of the house and its contents (P60) to its owner, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and failure to pay, is a sufficient penalty for the offense committed.<br\/><br\/>The sentence imposed by the trial court should therefore be, and\u00a0 is hereby, modified by substituting for so much thereof as imposes a penalty of one year and one day imprisonment, the penalty of four\u00a0 months and one day of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">arresto mayor<\/span>, and thus modified the sentence of the trial court should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> de oficio.<\/span><br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

with one-third of the costs <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>After the conclusion of the trial, Judge Simplicio del Rosario found that the evidence was sufficient to support the charges against the defendants Tin Tong Guim and Victoria Santiago, and sentenced each of them to pay a fine of P1,000 and each to pay one-third part of the costs:\u00a0 From that sentence the defendants Tin Tong Guim and Victoria Santiago appeal.<br\/><br\/>In this court the appellants make three assignments of error as follows:<br\/><br\/>(1)\u00a0 That during the trial, while Victoria Santiago was a witness in her own behalf, she was asked certain questions concerning the ownership of the opium which had\" been found in her possession, to which question she answered that it belonged to her husband.\u00a0 An objection was made to the question and answer and the objection was sustained.<br\/><br\/>(2)\u00a0 The second assignment of error in effect is identically the same as the first.<br\/><br\/>(3)\u00a0 The lower court erred in finding defendants Tin Tong Guim and Victoria Santiago guilty as charged.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the first assignment of error the appellant argues at length that the lower court committed an error in not hearing the testimony of the defendant Victoria Santiago in which she attempted to show that the opium in question belonged to her husband.\u00a0 The appellant attempts to show that the wife is not prohibited from giving testimony in a criminal case against her husband under the circumstances of the present case.\u00a0 The lower court perhaps committed an error in refusing to hear the witness.\u00a0 We do not believe, however, that the error was prejudicial in the present case.\u00a0 The question which the court was investigating did not relate to the ownership of the opium in question.\u00a0 The defendant was charged with <i>having in her possession and under her control <\/i>a certain\u00a0 quantity of opium, amounting to nearly P5,000.\u00a0 The Government attempted to prove only that the opium was found in her possession.\u00a0 Whether the opium belonged to her husband or not was a question of no importance except to be taken into consideration in fixing the penalty.\u00a0 Victoria Santiago testified that her husband was a Chinaman; that he had been absent in China for several months; that at the time he went to China he left the opium in a trunk in their house.\u00a0 She does not attempt to explain why the opium, amounting to such a large sum of money, was not left in the house until her husband's return.\u00a0 She does not attempt to explain why she had it in her possession at the time and place mentioned in the complaint.\u00a0 She does not attempt to explain why she had taken it out of the trunk and had beside her a number of empty cans with soldering material and a pipe used in smoking opium.\u00a0 If the Government had attempted to prove that she was the owner, then it might have been proper to have considered the admissibility of her testimony as going directly to disprove the allegations in the complaint.\u00a0 The Government made no attempt to show that she was the owner.\u00a0 The proof all goes to show simply that she had the possession of the opium.\u00a0 Whether a married woman can give testimony against her husband under circumstances like those present in the present case, we find unnecessary now to decide.\u00a0 It is sufficient to say that even admitting her statements that her husband was the owner in no way affects her liability under the complaint.\u00a0 The evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution, as well as the admissions of the defendant herself, shows clearly and beyond a reasonable doubt that she is guilty of the crime charged against her.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the defendant Tin Tong Guitn, the witnesses for the prosecution declare that when they entered the house where the opium was found they looked through an opening in the door and saw inside the house the three defendants; that when the policemen (the witnesses for the prosecution) attempted to enter the house the defendant Tin Tong Guim escaped through a rear door of the house.\u00a0 Tin Tong Guim presented a number of witnesses for the purpose of showing that at the time the opium was found in the house where Victoria Santiago and Pu To Wa were arrested he was in his house at No. 27 Plaza Santa Cruz of the city of Manila.\u00a0 These witnesses\u00a0 swear positively that they were in the house of Tin Tong Guim and talked with him for some time, giving the exact hours covering a period before the other defendants were arrested until an hour or more\u00a0 after the other defendants were arrested.\u00a0 The declarations, of these witnesses seem to be entirely credible until we take into consideration the fact that two of the policemen who assisted in arresting Victoria Santiago and Pu To Wa immediately after the arrest had been completed went to the house of Tin Tong Guim at No. 27 Plaza Santa Cruz and found that he was not there.\u00a0 They then made a search in another part of the city for him and were unable to find him and returned again to his house later on the same night, some time about 9 o'clock or after, and the only person they found in his house on the occasion of their visit was a young girl.\u00a0 The declarations of the policemen and the declaration of the defendant Tin Tong Guim and his witnesses cannot be harmonized.\u00a0 One or the other set of witnesses has declared\u00a0 falsely.\u00a0 The\u00a0 lower court who saw the demeanor of the witnesses upon the witness stand and who hear their declarations gave credit to the declarations of the policemen.\u00a0 The lower court believed that they went to the house of the defendant Tin Tong Guim at No. 27 Plaza Santa Cruz at the tme they said they did and that he was not there.\u00a0 The result is, therefore, that he and his witnesses must have falsified in their declarations upon that fact.\u00a0 The lower couit believed the declarations of the witnesses for the Government that Tin Tong Guim was at the house of Victoria Santiago and in possession of the opium in question together with Victoria Santiago.\u00a0 The defendant Pu To Wa is the wife of the defendant Tin Tong Guim.\u00a0 It is also a fact that the husband of Victoria Santiago, as admitted by the defendant Tin Tong Guim, was an employee of the latter.\u00a0 Tin Tong Guim admitted that he paid the electric light bill of the house in which Victoria Santiago lived.<br\/><br\/>The Honorable Simplicio del Rosario, in a very interesting opinion in which he analyzed very carefully the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause, reached the conclusion that the defendants, Tin Tong Guim and Victoria Santiago, were guilty of the crime charged. In our opinion, the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause fully supports the findings of fact.\u00a0 The circumstances under which the defendants and appellants were found in the possession of the opium, with a number of empty cans, with apparatus for the purpose of soldering and closing the cans, together with the fact that they had a pair of scales in their possession at the same time which were used for weighing opium, clearly indicate that they were engaged in the traffic of selling opium, an offense much more serious than that charged in the complaint.\u00a0 These facts we believe should be taken into consideration in imposing the penalty provided for by law for the illegal possession of opium.<br\/><br\/>It is our conclusion, therefore, that the sentence of the lower court should be modified and that each of the defendants and appellants should be sentenced to pay a fine of P1,000; that Tin Tong Guim, in addition to said fine, should be sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of six months; that Victoria Santiago, in addition to said\u00a0 fine, should be sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of three months, each to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and each to pay one-third part of the costs in the court below and one-half the costs of this instance.\u00a0 So ordered<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

GREGORIO YULO, AS ATTORNEY AND REPRESENTATIVE OF JUAN TUASON AND RUPERTO MONTINOLA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\"> This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo ordering the sheriff to execute a conveyance of certain real estate, the subject of the action, in favor of one Ruperto Montinola.<br\/><br\/>According to the claim of Gregorio Yulo as attorney for Juan Tuason, some time prior to the beginning of this action a mortgage held by Juan Tuason against the real estate of one Ceferino Domingo Lim was foreclosed by the former and the property described therein sold at public sale to said Juan Tuason under the bid of Gregorio Yulo, his attorney.\u00a0 The sale, so far as the record is concerned, was duly and properly made and affirmed by the court.\u00a0 Later the purchaser at the sale, Juan Tuason, asked the sheriff for a deed of the property in pursuance of the purchase thereof at the public sale, and the sheriff was about to execute the conveyance to the purchaser when one Ruperto Montinola presented himself to the sheriff alleging that he had purchased from the mortgagor and defendant in the action to foreclose the mortgage, Ceferino Domingo Lim, his right to redeem the mortgaged premises and tendered to the sheriff the amount for which the mortgaged property was sold, with the cests and expenses, at the same time demanding that the sheriff execute a deed of said property to him.\u00a0 The sheriff finding himself called upon by two different persons, with interests apparently opposing, to perform an official act, began this action to determine to whom the conveyance of the property should be issued.<br\/><br\/>The facts as claimed by Montinola are the same as those stated by Gregorio Yulo as attorney for Juan Tuason, except that Montinola claims that the sale of the real estate in question was under an execution issued upon a judgment and not under a decree in foreclosure.<br\/><br\/>The trial court found, and ordered in accordance with that finding, that the conveyance of the premises in question should be executed in favor of Ruperto Montinola, upon the ground that he purchased the equity of redemption of the mortgagor, stood in his shoes, and was, therefore, entitled to a conveyance of the property.<br\/><br\/>There are several reasons why the judgment must be reversed.<br\/><br\/>In the first place, the action is begun against the attorney Gregorio Yulo, who is alleged by the plaintiff to be representing both Juan Tuason and Ruperto Montinola.\u00a0 Under section 114 of the Code of Civil Procedure, an action must be brought by the real parties in interest.\u00a0 Under other provisions of the code, and as a\u00a0 corollary to the provisions of section 114, actions must be brought against the real parties in interest.\u00a0 If the sheriff had the right to bring the action at all, a question to which we will refer later, it should have been brought against Juan Tuason and Ruperto Montinola, and very possibly against Ceferino Domingo Lim also.\u00a0 The first two persons at least are the real parties in interest, and a judgment to be binding upon them and their interests must be against them personally.\u00a0 A judgment rendered against Gregorio Yulo as attorney for Juan Tuason and Montinola would not bind the latter, they not having appeared as parties in the action and having in no way litigated the questions involved.\u00a0 Unless they were estopped by some act of theirs, a judgment against Gregorio Yulo and Ruperto Montinola would be without force as to them, and they might on the day following the entry of such a judgment relitigate the questions already litigated in the other action.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, Gregorio Yulo cannot consistently represent Juan Tuason and Ruperto Montinola at the same time.\u00a0 Their interests, under the theory of the action and the pleadings, are clearly adverse to each other.\u00a0 Even if Gregorio Yulo were the proper party to be sued, he could be sued as the representative of only one of the two persons whom he is claimed to represent in this action.\u00a0 The interests of the other are so opposed to those of the one as to make an attempt to represent both farcical.<br\/><br\/>In the second place, the case was decided in the court below without any facts before it.\u00a0 Gregorio Yulo, as attorney for Juan Tuason, answered the complaint denying each and every allegation thereof and set up facts showing a special defense.\u00a0 Ruperto Montinola appeared by his attorneys and demurred to the complaint.\u00a0 The demurrer was overruled but, nevertheless, the complaint was ordered amended.\u00a0 An amended complaint was filed, to which the same demurrer was interposed by Ruperto Montinola and the same answer by Gregorio Yulo, as attorney for Juan Tuason.\u00a0 No action was taken on the demurrer to the amended complaint and nothing was done as to the issue joined by the answer of Gregorio Yulo as attorney for Juan Tuason.\u00a0 Instead, a final judgment upon the merits was entered in favor of Ruperto Montinola and against Juan Tuason, ordering the sheriff to execute a conveyance of the premises to the former.\u00a0 Relative to the basis of its decision the court says:\u00a0 \"This is a case submitted to the court on written facts which seem to be accepted by the defendants but demurred to by them.\"<br\/><br\/>The court, after this statement, goes on to detail the sale of the land in question under a judgment in favor of Juan Tuason, the expiration of eleven months after such sale, the application of Tuason to the sheriff for a conveyance, the objection thereto by Montinola upon the ground that he had obtained an assignment from Lim, the judgment debtor, of his right to redeem, and the tender to the sheriff of the amount for which the property sold, with interest and costs.<br\/><br\/>We do not know from the record what facts are admitted.\u00a0 Those stated in\u00a0 the complaint are denied by Gregorio Yulo as attorney for Juan Tuason, and as a special defense he sets up facts making an entirely different case from that shown by the complaint.\u00a0 As to the defendant Gregorio Yulo as attorney for Montinola, the facts stated in the complaint are admitted by the demurrer.\u00a0 There was no hearing, no evidence, no stipulation between the parties, and no agreed statement of facts.\u00a0 From the statement of the facts in the opinion of the trial court we do not know whether the sale was by virtue of an execution issued upon an ordinary judgment for a sum of money, as seems to be alleged in the complaint, or whether it was a sale by virtue of a mortgage foreclosure as alleged in the answer.\u00a0 Certainly the facts as stated in the brief of Montinola are entirely different from those stated in the brief of Gregorio Yulo as attorney for Tuason; and their arguments are based upon the facts stated in their briefs.\u00a0 This indicates that there was no agreement upon the facts in the court below in the real sense of the term and that there must have been some mistake in assuming that the facts were agreed upon.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for the purpose of giving the parties an opportunity to agree upon a statement of facts upon which the case may be decided or for such proceeding upon the demurrer and answer as the parties may desire and the law permits.<br\/><br\/>Certain questions, however, having been thoroughly argued in this court and presented on this appeal, we take the occasion, as we have in numerous other cases, to set out our views upon the questions thus presented and argued, to the end that time and expense may be saved the litigants.\u00a0 In all probability our opinion upon these questions will settle the case once for all and obviate the necessity of again presenting to this court or to any other the same facts upon which the case rests here.<br\/><br\/>As to that portion of the judgment which requires the sheriff to execute a conveyance of the land in question to Ruperto Montinola:<br\/><br\/>Treating the sale as one in foreclosure, we may say that even if it be conceded that there exists an equity of redemption after mortgage property has been sold and the sale duly confirmed, and even though it be admitted that Ruperto Montinola purchased that right of redemption, there still appears no reason why a conveyance of the property should be made to him by the sheriff.\u00a0 Redemption of the land merely replaces title in the mortgagor, if it be assumed that the title was at any time divested.\u00a0 It is from him that Montinola must obtain his conveyance\u00a0 if he is entitled\u00a0 to it from any one.\u00a0 It is clear that, if Lim had himself redeemed the\u00a0 property, there would have been\u00a0 no necessity\u00a0 for the execution\u00a0 of a conveyance, as a\u00a0 redemption cancels and renders without force or effect the sale of the property by the sheriff and revests title in the mortgagor.\u00a0 Certainly the sheriff owes no\u00a0 duty\u00a0 whatever to Montinola so far as the execution of a conveyance is\u00a0 concerned.\u00a0 If the property is redeemed, it is, by that fact, taken from the hands of the sheriff and he loses jurisdiction over it.\u00a0\u00a0 A sheriff may issue a conveyance only by virtue of official duty.\u00a0 If there were no redemption, his sale of the property would require him to execute a conveyance to the purchaser.\u00a0 But when there is a redemption, the sale and all of its incidents and effects are destroyed and obliterated, and, accordingly, he has no official connection with the matter thereafter.\u00a0 It returns to the mortgagor.\u00a0 It is clear, therefore, that the demand of Montinola that the sheriff execute to him a conveyance of the property in question, after the redemption, is entirely gratuitous.\u00a0 It in effect asks the sheriff to perform an act not imposed upon him as a duty and which refers to property over which he has lost jurisdiction and control.\u00a0 If Montinola is entitled to a conveyance, he must obtain it from the mortgagor Lim.<br\/><br\/>What has been said with relation to the sheriff's duty in the case of redemption from sales in actions of foreclosure applies with equal force to redemption from sales under executions; and Montinola, on redemption, would not be entitled to receive from the sheriff a conveyance in either case.<br\/><br\/>We may say, furthermore, that this court has already held that in mortgage foreclosures the rights of the mortgagee and persons holding under him are cut off by the sale, when duly confirmed, and with them the equity of redemption.\u00a0 The reason for that holding is that the right of redemption being purely statutory, and there being no statute conferring that right, it does not exist.\u00a0 We so held in the case of the Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas <i>vs<\/i>. Romana Gauzon.\u00a0 (10 Off. Gaz., 1043, notes.)\u00a0 The same opinion is expressed, in the case of Raymundo <i>vs<\/i>. Sunico.\u00a0 (25 Phil. Rep., 365.)\u00a0 While the judgment in the former case was subsequently vacated and the cause remanded for a new trial, it was done upon grounds which did not affect the decision as to the right of redemption, and the opinion of the court expressed in that case after full argument and extensive citation of authorities, and after full consideration, is one to which we adhere at this time.<br\/><br\/>It is a principle well established that the right of redemption is a statutory right and does not exist in the absence of statute.\u00a0 In the case of Parker <i>vs<\/i>. Dacres (130 U. S., 43), the court says, at page 47: \"Counsel for the plaintiff speaks of a common-law right of redemption after sale that attaches in the absence of any statutory provision on the subject.\u00a0 We are not aware of any such right existing at common law, or in the system of equity as administered in the courts of England previous to the organization of our Government.\u00a0 It is a mistake to suppose that the case of Clark <i>vs<\/i>. Reyburn (8 Wall., 319), recognizes a right of redemption after a sale under a foreclosure decree independently of statute.\u00a0 It is there stated that 'by the common law, when the condition of the mortgage was broken, the estate of the\u00a0 mortgagee became indefeasible,' and that 'equity interposed and permitted the mortgagor, within a reasonable time, to redeem upon the payment of the amount due before sale;' also, that, according to the settled practice in equity, when proceedings to foreclose were\u00a0 not regulated by statute, this right to redeem before sale is fixed by the primary.decree, and that only in the event of final default in paying the amount ascertained to be due is an absolute sale ordered.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 It is clear that the right to redeem after sale, wherever it exists, is statutory.\"<br\/><br\/>It is equally certain that the right of redemption in the form in which it is asserted in this case, i. e., after sale under decree of court, did not exist under the Spanish law.\u00a0 Mr. Coote says: \"By the civil law, the debtor might redeem the estate on payment of his debt, at any time before sentence passed.\"\u00a0 (Coote on Mori,\u00a0 10.)\u00a0 \"Until debarred by judicial sentence.\"\u00a0 (Ibid., 209.)\u00a0 \"Until decree of foreclosure.\"\u00a0 (Ibid.)\u00a0 \"The mortgagor is the equitable owner until the land is redeemed or foreclosed.\"\u00a0 (Ibid., 319.)\u00a0 Under the Spanish law the right of redemption was destroyed by the sale under the decree of foreclosure.<br\/><br\/>\"Both at law and in equity,\" says Mr. Jickling, \"the conveyance is at first conditional, not absolute; and in\u00a0 both, the estate may, on an event, be discharged of the condition, and become the indefeasible property of the mortgagee.\u00a0 At law, that event is the non-payment at the day agreed upon; in equity, it is the decree of a court of judicature.\u00a0 In the former jurisdiction, it is conventional; in the latter, judicial.\"\u00a0 (Jickling's Analogy, 66.)<br\/><br\/>Chancellor Kent, in his definition of a mortgage, states that:\u00a0 \"The legal ownership (of the\u00a0 land\u00a0 mortgaged) is vested in the creditor; but in equity, the mortgagor remains the owner until he is debarred by his own default, or by judicial decree.\"\u00a0 (4 Kent, 133.)<br\/><br\/>And again:\u00a0 \"The equity doctrine is, that the mortgage is a mere security for the debt, and only a chattel interest, and that until\u00a0 decree of foreclosure, the mortgagor continues the real owner of the\u00a0 fee.\"\u00a0 (Ibid., pp. 159, 160.)<br\/><br\/>Hillard says: \"Foreclosure is the process by which a mortgagee acquires an absolute title\u00a0 to\u00a0 the property of which he had previously been only the conditional owner, or upon which he had previously a mere lien or encumbrance.\"\u00a0 (2 Hillard on Mort., 1, 1st ed.)<br\/><br\/>Whenever the decree is pronounced, the event which fixes the limit\u00a0 to the mortgagor's equitable estate has happened; and to say the mortgagor may redeem after \"sentence passed,\" or after he is \"debarred by judicial decree,\" or \"decree of foreclosure,\" is in contradiction of, and directly repugnant to language so explicit and entirely unambiguous, as to preclude the possibility of successful cavil.<br\/><br\/>The doctrine of the adjudged cases may be stated, without hazarding successful controversy, to be that after decree of foreclosure or judicial sentence, and immediately thereupon, the entire estate, both legal and equitable, becomes vested in the mortgagee, subject only to a judicial sale, from the proceeds of which the mortgagor may, perchance, derive the benefit of a resulting surplus.<br\/><br\/>This is the general doctrine prevailing in the absence of statute.\u00a0\u00a0 It may be modified, and is modified, either materially or casually by the legislative authority of the state.\u00a0 Here the\u00a0 mortgagor is given until the term of court next succeeding the one in which the decree of foreclosure is made to pay the mortgage debt, interest, cost, and charges; and in the event of such payment the land remains his own.\u00a0 The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure which deal with the foreclosure of mortgages are silent on the equity of redemption.\u00a0 Having arrived at the point where the sale is to take place, reference is then made to the provisions relating to sales under execution, and the provisions in relation to such sales are made applicable to sales in foreclosure.\u00a0 While the provisions relating to the sale of property under execution, to which the provisions of the code relative to the foreclosure of mortgages make reference, provide that, where a sale of property is made by virtue of an execution, the debtor whose property is sold shall have one year within which to pay the judgment, interest, costs, and charges and to retake the property thus sold, we are, nevertheless, of the opinion that it was not the intention of the Legislature to include those provisions in the reference contained in the sections\u00a0 relating to mortgage foreclosures.\u00a0 The substantive rights of the parties to a mortgage are determined by the law, and in the present instance, it is undoubted, under the Code of Civil Procedure as well as under the general law, that the\u00a0 right of redemption is property and is subject to the same protection which other property receives at the hands of the law.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0 owner of that equity is entitled to the same consideration which the owner of other property must receive and he can be deprived of it only under the same circumstances and conditions and with the same formalities.\u00a0 It is equally true, on the other hand, that the equity of redemption, if there be one, being when granted property of the mortgagor and in derogation of the rights of the mortgagee, will not be held to be conferred upon the mortgagor in the absence of clear\u00a0 statutory provisions to that effect.\u00a0 The contract between the parties is that to which we must first look to determine their rights; and that contract, as interpreted and construed under the law of the state, is the only source from\u00a0 which the rights of the parties under the contract spring.\u00a0 The contract is this case grants no such right; and it being the general rule that the rights which pertain to the mortgagor are completely terminated and cut off by the decree of foreclosure and the sale thereunder, the latter being duly confirmed, it follows of necessity that his rights can not be continued beyond that point except by clear provision of statute, for the reason that, in the absence of such provisions, the rights\u00a0 of the mortgagee under the contract would become absolute on the happening of that event.\u00a0 We are of the opinion, therefore, that when, in the law relating to the foreclosure of mortgages, reference was made to the provisions of the code relative to the sale of property under execution, it was intended, there being no express words to the contrary, to include in such reference only such provisions as refer to the mere management and conduct of the sale\u2014the mere ministerial acts which must be performed in order that the sale be legal\u2014and not to those provisions which relate to the substantive rights of the parties before or after the sale has\u00a0 been consummated.<br\/><br\/>The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for such proceedings, if any, as the parties interested may desire to take consistent with law.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Hart to pay a fine of P30 and each of the other defendants to pay a fine of P15, and each to pay one-fourth part of the costs, and in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment for the fine imposed.\u00a0 Said sentence was rendered on the 20th of July, 1912.\u00a0 The defendants immediately paid the fine imposed.<br\/><br\/>Later, upon the 31st of July, 1912, the prosecuting attorney of the Province of Pampanga presented a motion in the Court of First Instance in which he alleged that.\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"The aforesaid accused in this cause were arraigned, plead guilty of the crime charged to them in the complaint, and were sentenced by this court to pay, each of the gamblers, to wit, C. J. Miller, D. P. Dunn, and Serviliano Natividad, a fine of P15, and the landlord, William C, Hart, a fine of P30, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>\"That the said accused accepted and acquiesced in the judgment rendered against them, for they paid to the clerk of the court the fines imposed in the sentence, whereby the said judgment became\u00a0 final.<br\/><br\/>\"That, subsequent to the rendition of the said judgment, which was pronounced on July 20, 1912, this office of the provincial fiscal learned that the senior inspector of Constabulary of this province had seized, in the place where the gambling occurred, a certain sum\u00a0 of money which was deposited by him in the treasury of this province,\" and requested the court to modify its decision of the 20th of July, 1912, with reference to the sum of money mentioned in\u00a0 said motion, \"and to make any other provision proper under the law,\"<\/blockquote>Upon the presentation of the foregoing motion the said defendants were cited to appear in court and to answer the same upon the 1st of August, 1912.\u00a0 Upon the hearing of said motion, so far as the record shows, no additional evidence was taken.\u00a0 The facts stated in said motion apparently, so far as the record shows, were admitted by both parties.\u00a0 The record shows that the prosecuting attorney and the attorney for the defendants argued the questions of law involved in said motion.\u00a0 After hearing the arguments pro and con by the respective attorneys, the Honorable Julio Llorente, on the 4th of October, 1912, rendered the following decision:<br\/><blockquote>\"The accused in this cause, on arraignment, all plead guilty.\u00a0 In consequence of that plea, they were sentenced, the landlord, William C, Hart, to pay a fine of P30, and each of the others to pay a fine of P15, with the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and to the payment of the costs.\u00a0 Subsequent to the said judgment,\u00a0 the prosecuting attorney, alleging that a certain sum of money had been seized in the place where the gambling was conducted, presented a motion\u00a0 wherein he prayed the court to amend its said judgment in so far as it concerned the disposition to be made of the said sum, and to make any other provision in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>\"Act No. 1757, section 13, expressly repeals article 1801 of the Civil Code and articles 343 and 579 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 The said Act did not repeal article 345 of the last-mentioned code, wherefore we believe it remains in force.\u00a0 This article 345 specifically provides that the money or property and the instruments or appliances used for gambling games or raffles shall be forfeited.\u00a0 The court holds, therefore, that the sum seized, to\u00a0 which the prosecuting attorney refers, should be confiscated.<br\/><br\/>\"The said sum shall be confiscated and finally disposed of in the manner determined by law.\u00a0 So ordered.\"<\/blockquote>From that sentence the defendants William C. Hart and Serviliano Natividad, appealed to this court and made the following assignments of error here:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. The court erred by amending its judgment.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The court likewise erred in ordering the confiscation of the sum in question.\"<\/blockquote>In support of the first assignment of error the appellants contend that inasmuch as they had complied with the sentence of the lower court of the 20th of July, 1912, said sentence was final and could not, after said satisfaction, be again opened for the purpose of modifying it or for the purpose of imposing an additional penalty.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants contend that where a defendant has paid his fine, the court has no power to recall him, to reverse the sentence imposing the fine and impose another sentence which inflicts a different or greater punishment.<br\/><br\/>In reply to the arguments of the appellants, the Attorney-General contends that the order of the lower court made on the 4th of October, 1912, declaring forfeited the money mentioned in said motion, did not have the effect of imposing upon the defendants an additional or other penalty than that imposed in his original sentence.\u00a0 In this connection it will be noted, by reference to said motion, that the money in question was \"found by the Constabulary officers at the place and at the time when the defendants were arrested under the original complaint.\"\u00a0 There is no allegation nor proof in the record showing that the money so found by the Constabulary officers at the time and place where the\u00a0 defendants were arrested belonged to any of the defendants.\u00a0 While, of course, the allegation raises a strong presumption that the money was used in the game, yet the fact is neither alleged nor proved.\u00a0 Admitting, however, that the money was used by the defendants in the prohibited game and did belong to them, then certainly it should be returned to them, unless the same is\u00a0 declared to be forfeited.\u00a0 If the money belongs to them and is declared forfeited, as an additional penalty to the fine imposed in the decision of the 20th of July, 1912, there can be little doubt that the additional sentence declaring the money forfeited is an additional penalty imposed upon the defendants.\u00a0 This, of course, presupposes that the money belonged to the defendants.\u00a0 It seems clear, therefore, admitting the facts alleged but not sustained by proof, to wit, that the money belonged to the defendants, that the additional sentence is an additional penalty to a sentence which had already become final.\u00a0 The sentence had become final by reason of the fact that the defendants had complied with it.\u00a0 The sentence of the court had been executed.\u00a0 The defendants had complied with the terms of the sentence imposed.\u00a0 Certainly it cannot be contended that after the sentence had been complied with that the same had not become final.\u00a0 No rule is better settled than the rule that courts cannot modify, alter, or change a sentence after it has become final.\u00a0 Under the practice in the Philippine Islands a sentence in a criminal cause may become final in two ways:\u00a0 First, by the lapse of fifteen days after the same is rendered and pronounced (sec. 47 of General\u00a0 Orders, No. 58); and, second, by compliance with the terms of the sentence.\u00a0 The, present case is certainly a good illustration showing how a sentence may be complied with and thus become final. Another illustration might be given.\u00a0 Suppose, for example, that a man is sentenced to be imprisoned\u00a0 for a period of ten days.\u00a0 He immediately enters upon the performance of the sentence.\u00a0 Can the court thereafter, without any objection on the part of the defendant to such sentence, change, alter, or modify said sentence, as, for example, to impose a longer sentence? We believe that this question must necessarily be answered in the negative.\u00a0 With reference to the first assignment of error we are of the opinion that the lower court committed an\u00a0 error in imposing an additional penalty upon the defendants\u00a0 by declaring forfeited the money in question.\u00a0 This conclusion, however, is based upon the assumed fact that the money in question belonged to the defendants.\u00a0 Of course if the money did not belong to the defendants, then the sentence declaring the same forfeited could in no way affect them.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the second assignment of error, the appellants contend:<br\/><ol><li>That in the original criminal action there was no allegation in the complaint showing or tending to show that there had been any money used by the defendants, or that any money had been found which had been in any way used in connection with the prohibited game; and<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That, inasmuch as the criminal action was based upon the provisions of Act No. 1757 of the Philippine Commission, the lower court could not invoke the\u00a0 provisions of article 345 of the Penal Code for the purpose of declaring the money forfeited, even admitting that it had been used in connection with the prohibited game.<\/li><\/ol>The Attorney-General, in reply to the contention of the appellants, asserts or contends that Act No. 1757 is in effect an amendment of the Penal Code and that all of the provisions of the Penal Code relating to the same subject matter are equally applicable to the crimes punished under said Act (No. 1757).\u00a0 (<i>See<\/i> Act No. 2212.)\u00a0 In view of the fact that we have reached the conclusion that the lower court committed a reversible error in attempting to change or modify his sentence after the same had become final, we deem it unnecessary to decide for the present the questions raised by the second assignment of error.\u00a0 We prefer to leave that question to be decided in a case where the same is directly in point and important for the decision.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons above stated, the sentence of the lower court as above quoted, of October 4, 1912, is hereby reversed and declared to be of no effect; and without any finding as to costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

DIONISIO JAKOSALEM, SHERIFF, ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Motions\u00a0 or objections have been made in these causes which raise the question of the necessity of the use of the English language in the courts of the Islands.\u00a0 In the first case a motion is made by the defendant-appellant to strike from the record a brief filed by the plaintiff-appellant upon the ground that it is \"not written in the official language.\"\u00a0 A motion is made in the other case to set aside and vacate a judgment of this court upon the ground that it is not written in the English language.<br\/><br\/>The brief and the judgment objected to are in the Spanish language and were filed in actions begun prior to the 1st day of January, 1913.\u00a0 The question raised by these objections is whether Act No. 1946, amending section 12 of the Code of Civil Procedure, wherein it is provided that the official language is to be English after January 1, 1913, is retrospective or prospective only.<br\/><br\/>The title of the Act is as follows:\u00a0 \"An Act further amending section twelve of Act Numbered One hundred and ninety,entitled 'An Act providing a Code of Procedure in Civil Actions and Special Proceedings in the Philippine Islands,' as amended, by providing for the continuation of the Spanish language as the official language of the courts until the first day of January, one thousand nine hundred and thirteen, and for other purposes.\"\u00a0 By virtue of this Act section 12 of the Code of Civil Procedure is amended so as to read, so far as material here, as follows:\u00a0 \"The official language of all the courts and their records shall be the Spanish language until the first day of January, nineteen hundred and thirteen.\u00a0 After that date, English shall be the official language.\"<br\/><br\/>The Act contains, as is seen, no express words giving it a retrospective or retroactive effect, nor is there anything found therein which indicates an intention to give it such an effect.\u00a0 Its effect is, rather, by clear intendment, prospective.<br\/><br\/>It is a rule of statutory construction that all statutes are to be construed as having only a prospective operation unless the purpose and intention of the Legislature to give them a retrospective effect is expressly declared or is necessarily implied from the language used.\u00a0 In every case of doubt, the doubt must be solved against the retrospective effect.\u00a0 The cases supporting this rule are almost without number.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Reynolds<i> vs<\/i>. M'Arthur (2 Pet., 416, 434), it was said that\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"It is a principle which has always been held sacred in the United States, that laws by which human action is to be regulated, look forward not backward; and are never to be construed retrospectively, unless the language of the\u00a0 Act shall render such construction indispensable.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Leete <i>vs<\/i>. St. Louis State Bank (115 Mo., 184), it was held that\u2014<br\/><blockquote>\"In construing statutes in regard to whether their action is to be prospective or retrospective, all the adjudicated cases and all the text-writers with unbroken uniformity unite in declaring 'that they are to operate <i>prospectively<\/i> and not otherwise unless the intent that they are to operate in such an unusual way, to wit, retrospectively, is manifested on the face of the statute in a manner altogether free from ambiguity.'\"<\/blockquote>The case of Berdan <i>vs<\/i>. Van Riper (16 N. J. L., 7) holds that where a statute is susceptible of construction as both prospective and retrospective, the former construction will be adopted, but especially if the retrospective operation will work injustice to anyone.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. American Sugar Co. (202 U. S., 563), there was presented this same question for the resolution of which there was required an interpretation of an Act of Congress passed to carry into effect the convention between the United States and the Republic of Cuba relative to the importation into the United States of certain products\u00a0 of that Republic.\u00a0 The first section of the Act provided, among other things, that the President of the United States \"is hereby authorized to issue his proclamation declaring he has received such evidence, and <i>there upon, on the tenth day after exchange of ratifications <\/i>to such convention\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 and <i>so long<\/i> as\u00a0 said convention shall remain in force, all articles \u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 which are now imported\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 shall continue to be admitted free of duty.\"\u00a0 In pursuance of this Act, the President issued his proclamation in which he declared and proclaimed said convention to be in effect \"<i>on the tenth day from this my proclamation.<\/i>\"\u00a0 The question arose over the duty to be paid on sugar imported from Cuba prior to the date when the Act took effect.<br\/><br\/>The question before the court was put by the court itself thus:<br\/><blockquote>\"We start, then, with the proposition that not the treaty, but the Act of Congress, was to fix the date that the treaty should take effect.\u00a0 What date Congress fixed is the question to be considered. It was certainly competent for Congress (with the consent of Cuba) to have given the treaty retrospective, immediate or prospective operation.\u00a0 Which did Congress do?\u00a0 And in reply we are\u00a0 to remember there is a presumption against retrospective operation, and we have said that words in a statute ought not to have such operation 'unless they are so clear, strong, and imperative that no other meaning can be annexed to them, or unless the intention of the legislator can not be otherwise satisfied\" (United States <i>vs<\/i>. Burr, 159 U. S., 78.)<\/blockquote>It was held that the Act should have a prospective effect only.<br\/><br\/>In the cases before us we believe that the usual rule ought to be applied.\u00a0 Although there is a difference recognized by the courts between acts which affect substantial rights and those which affect only procedure or convenience, the courts being more liberal in their interpretation relative to retrospective operation in the latter than in the former case, we do not believe that such difference is sufficiently important in the cases before us to warrant us in relaxing the rigidity of the rule.\u00a0 Serious inconvenience might be the result of giving the Act in question a retrospective effect, and substantial rights might possibly be prejudiced thereby.\u00a0 The Act itself\u00a0 being\u00a0 by its terms applicable only after January 1, 1913, we think that there exists no reason why the general rules of construction should not prevail, even if construction or interpretation is in any sense necessary.<br\/><br\/>We therefore hold that the Act in question is applicable only to actions and proceedings begun in the courts of the Islands on and after the 1st day of January, 1913; and is not applicable to actions or proceedings begun prior to that date.<br\/><br\/>The motion in case No. 8404 is denied, and the objection in case No. 7832 is overruled.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Lucas y Eugenio who are also in this house in the character of proteges, named Filomena and Joaquin, minors and orphans by loss of their mother; and I authorize and charge my wife to provide in her will that she may make after my death, that her testamentary executors shall deliver this aforesaid property on Calle Anloague, as an inheritance from her, to the person or persons who may have assisted and cared for her during her widowhood until her death.\u00a0 If the persons who may have served her should be from different families, I charge her testamentary executors, in\u00a0 order to avoid disagreements among such persons, publicly or privately to sell the said property on Calle Anloague immediately after her death and to divide in equal shares the net proceeds derived thereby.\u00a0 If through involuntary negligence my wife and legatee should be unable to make a will after my death, or if for any other cause she should not fulfill the charge I impose upon her in this twelfth clause, it is my will that it be complied with and fulfilled by my brother, Ramon Fabie, or, in his\u00a0 default, by his heirs, his sons named Serafin and Jose and surnamed Fabie.\"<\/blockquote>Article 675 of the Civil Code prescribes as follows with regard to the interpretation of wills:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every testamentary provision shall be understood in the literal meaning of its words, unless it clearly appears that the will of the testator was different.\u00a0 In case of doubt, that which appears most in accordance with the intention of the testator, according to the tenor of the same will, shall be observed.<br\/><br\/>\"A testator cannot prohibit the contest of his will in the cases in which there exists nullity specified by law.\"<\/blockquote>A uniform rule has been set down by the supreme court of Spain, with respect to the construction\u00a0 and application of the said article of the Civil Code, also in force\u00a0 in that kingdom, in several of its decisions, among them that of May 24, 1882, where it says:\u00a0 That the will of the testator is the first and principal law in the matter of testaments, and when it is clearly and precisely expressed the decision of the questions argued at trial, relative to its execution and fulfillment, must be in accord with it as construed from the plain and literal meaning of the testator's words, except when it may certainly appear that his intention was different from that literally expressed.\u00a0 This same rule was reaffirmed in the decisions of May 8, 1901, October 8, 1902, and January 14, 1903.<br\/><br\/>In the preinserted clause of the said will of the deceased Fabie it appears explicitly ordered by the testator that, after the death of his wife Maria Cristina Calderon, the legatee of the usufruct of the property situated at No. 173 Calle Anloague, now Juan Luna, the said property should be delivered to the person or persons who may have served and cared for his aforementioned wife during her widowhood until her death;\u00a0 and it is also provided therein by the testator that, in case the said legatee of the revenues of the property referred to should not in her will direct the delivery of such property to the legatee or legatees indicated, as in fact she did not do, then the testator's will, relative to the delivery of the said property to the person or persons who may have served and cared for his widow until her death, should be fulfilled by his brother Ramon Fabie, or, in the event of his failure or default, by this brother's sons, Serafin and Jose, surnamed Fabie.<br\/><br\/>The testator's will, as recorded in the above clause 12, is so clear and definite that, in order duly to comply therewith, it needs but be determined who are the persons that must be considered as the legatees on account of their having served and cared for the testator's widow until her death.<br\/><br\/>From a due examination of the evidence, taken at trial on the petition of the appellants, who\u00a0 appeared and claimed a share in the aforementioned estate and legacy,, it is concluded that those entitled thereto are Encarnacion Gutierrez Calderon, Filomena Calderon, Potenciana de la Cruz, Basilisa Salteras, Candida Reyes,\u00a0 Benita Garcia, Maria and Josefa Calderon, and Petronila Eugenio, and so the trial judge also held in his order of September 23, 1911, except with respect to the little girls Maria and Josef a Calderon, whom he considered to be too young to have been able to serve the widow Maria Cristina Calderon as domestics; but the record shows that these children, as the widow's protegees, lived in her house until her death and, sometimes the one and sometimes the other, used to accompany her, even when she went to church, and that, although they were minors, they could have rendered the widow assistance and services sufficient and proportionate to their respective ages; and we are of the opinion that, from the testator's intention as expressed in his will, it is undeniable that the assistance and services rendered to the widow, required as a condition for meriting the legacy in question, were sufficient to the needs and conveniences of the testator's widow in respect to the many chores in the house, and enough to fill the requirements of a woman sickly and infirm in her already advanced age.\u00a0 The company of obliging and obedient little girls is usually more agreeable\u00a0 and useful to elderly and sick persons than that of adults.<br\/><br\/>With the report of the testator's brother, Ramon Fabie, the testator's will is not legally fulfilled, and it is not just that the other persons, besides Petronila Eugenio, who rendered services to and assisted the widow Maria Cristina Calderon should be deprived of the proportionate share of the legacy to which they are entitled.<br\/><br\/>Petronila Eugenio was already in the house serving the wife of the testator while the latter was still living, and had he seen that Petronila alone could serve and attend her during the widowhood of his wife and that the latter would not need other servants, he would have bequeathed the whole of the said house to Petronila; and if the deceased Miguel Fabie provided in his will that the property should be delivered to the person or persons who should render useful services to and assist his widow until her\u00a0 death, it was because he knew and was aware that there were other servants in the house, and evidently imposed this condition in order that those who were servants there might continue as such until his wife's death.\u00a0 Since some of them did do so, as\u00a0 proven by the record, the law must be fulfilled in accordance with the tenor of the last will of the testator.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons we reverse the order of December 6, 1911, and declare that Petronila Eugenio, Pilomena Calderon, Encarnacion Gutierrez Calderon, Potenciana de la Cruz, Basilisa Salteras, Candida Reyes, Benita Garcia, Maria Calderon, and Josef a Calderon are entitled to receive <i>pro rata<\/i> the sale value of the property situated at No. 173, formerly No. 29, Calle Anloague, now Juan Luna.\u00a0 No special finding\u00a0 is made as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Johnson, Carson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

Kincaid in representation of the defendants, Batlle and wife, submitted the said report to the court without objection\u00a0 and with a verbal request for its approval.\"<\/blockquote>Notwithstanding this stipulation the court upon its own motion reduced the award to P105,144.50.\u00a0 The appeal is from that part of the judgment reducing the award.\u00a0 The notice of the appeal was filed on the 18th day of September, 1912.\u00a0 On the 21st day of September of the same year the city of Manila moved the court to execute the judgment in accordance with the provisions of sections 247 and 248 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 At that time there were present in court Mr. Adams and Mr. Lacalle representing the city of Manila and Mr. Kincaid representing the defendants Evaristo Batlle y Hernandez and his wife.\u00a0 The city of Manila offered to\u00a0 the attorney for the appellants the sum awarded by the judgment of the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 Mr. Kincaid accepted that offer with the statement that he received it as a part payment of the sum to which his client had a right in law and under the award of the commission and he expressly reserved his right to appeal.\u00a0 The money was paid by the city of Manila not in cash but by warrant such as it habitually uses in paying claims against it.\u00a0 That warrant reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"No. 369699-B.\u2014The Government of the Philippine Islands.-To the Treasurer of the Philippine Islands.\u2014Manila, P.

it was not the result of an accord and satisfaction\u2014an agreement where one of the parties undertook to give or\u00a0 perform and the other party to accept, in satisfaction of a claim, liquidated or in dispute, and arising either from contract or from tort, something other than or different from what he was, or considered himself, entitled to.\u00a0 It was but a step in a statutory proceeding in which the defendant received no more than he was entitled to under that proceeding.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the moving party cites, in support of his contentions, the decisions of several States.\u00a0 A careful examination of the first case cited under each State discloses that, with one or two exceptions, Idaho and perhaps Texas, they are not in point.\u00a0 Considerable reliance is placed upon the case of Pyle <i>vs<\/i>. Wood (18 Idaho, 674), and the argument used by the court therein.\u00a0\u00a0 In that case the court, in depriving defendant of his right of appeal, laid stress upon and drew some important deductions from the fact that the statute provided for the payment of the money to the clerk of the court in case it was refused by the defendant.\u00a0 In our opinion, the court in that case falls into the error which counsel for the moving party in this case commits\u2014a confusion of the owner's <i>constitutional<\/i> with what we may call, as distinguished therefrom, his <i>statutory<\/i> rights.\u00a0 The payment of the money to the clerk has no particular significance under the statutes, except when the owner's constitutional rights are being considered.\u00a0 It is conceded that the plaintiff cannot execute the judgment in its favor by taking possession of the land without paying the money to the defendant, securing to him its payment, or paying it to some person for his benefit.\u00a0 The protection of his constitutional rights, as viewed by the statute makers, requires this; and it was to meet what the lawmakers deemed was, or might possibly be, the requirement of the constitution that the legislature provided that the money representing the value of the land condemned, if the defendant refuse to accept it, be\u00a0 paid to the clerk of the court for him.\u00a0 The payment of the money to the clerk has, from the viewpoint of the legislator, nothing to do with the rights which are conferred upon the defendant by <i>statute<\/i>.\u00a0 It has to do simply with the <i>constitutional<\/i> provision requiring compensation before he be deprived of his land.\u00a0 His right to appeal is not a constitutional but a statutory right.\u00a0 That is the right which the defendant is asserting in this motion.\u00a0 He makes no claim that his constitutional rights have been infringed; he says simply that the moving party is seeking to deprive him of a right granted by statute.\u00a0 If we have properly conceived the purpose of paying the money to the clerk, namely, the fulfillment of the constitutional requirement, then such payment in no way touches the defendant's other rights.\u00a0 It cannot be conceived that it was the purpose of the legislature, in protecting the constitutional rights of defendant, to take away from him, at the same time, a right granted by statute.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for moving party quotes with marked approval the following from the Idaho court for the purpose of demonstrating that the owner ought to be penalized for taking the payment tendered:\u00a0 \"Certainly a defendant would never refuse to accept the award if the acceptance is no waiver of his right of defense.\"<br\/><br\/>We conceive that this statement misses the point involved in the discussion.\u00a0 The purpose of the court there, as well as of counsel here, seems to be to produce an argument which will prevent the defendant from accepting the tender without losing something.\u00a0 Our position is that he has already lost its equivalent when he accepts it.\u00a0 Why should he not take the money?\u00a0 The plaintiff has taken the property.\u00a0 What should the defendant have in compensation for the deprivation?\u00a0 Where in the statute is it provided that the defendant shall not take the money, and where in the statute does it appear that if he does take it he shall be punished\u00a0 for doing so\u00a0 by being deprived of his right to appeal?\u00a0\u00a0 If it is not in the statute, what principle of justice supports that contention?\u00a0 Defendant had an\u00a0 undisputed right, under the ordinary principles of the law, to the possession and use of his property until the judgment of the last court of the land to which he had a right to appeal deprived-him of it.\u00a0 By special and exceptional provision plaintiff in eminent domain is permitted to take it away from him.\u00a0 That being the case, justice, would declare that he receive just compensation for such deprivation.\u00a0 The statute, attempting to do justice as nearly as possible, provides that the payment of the value set\u00a0 by the\u00a0 court shall be sufficient to meet that requirement.\u00a0 The simple fact is that the plaintiff has taken something which belongs to the defendant.\u00a0 All that the defendant has done is to take that which compensates him.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, to deprive him of anything more is unfair and unjust.\u00a0 The object of the statute in requiring payment was beneficial, not punitive.\u00a0 Its\u00a0 purpose was the protection not the deprivation of his rights.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that the court has no authority to attach to this intended protection a punishment or to construe the beneficial purpose of the statute, even partly, into a penalty.<br\/><br\/>The instrument signed by the defendant on receipt of the payment is, under the facts and circumstances of the case, not controlling.\u00a0 The proceeding was not for the payment of a claim against the city.\u00a0 The payment was not the result of an agreement between the parties where one of them undertook to give or perform, and the other to accept in satisfaction of a claim, liquidated or in dispute, and arising either from contract or tort, something other than or different from what he considered himself entitled to.\u00a0 There seems to have been no dispute between the parties about the value of the property.\u00a0 The moving party conceded in the court below, in effect, that the value was that set by the commission,\u00a0 Witness the stipulation recommending that the court assess the damages in favor of the defendant in the amount assessed by the commission.\u00a0 There was no dispute or difference between the parties as to what the defendant was entitled to.\u00a0 The plaintiff's sole purpose was to put itself in a position where it could legally take possession of the property and prosecute its improvements thereon at once.\u00a0 That is conceded in the bill of exceptions, signed or approved by both parties.\u00a0 Under\u00a0 such circumstances it cannot be held that the mere signing of the voucher in question would deprive the defendant of any of his rights.\u00a0 The intention of the parties is determined to a large extent by the nature of the proceeding in\u00a0 which the voucher was signed.\u00a0 The instrument having been presented and signed in the proceeding which had for its object the possession of the property can be held under the circumstances of this case to have no more effect than the payment of the money would have had.\u00a0 The statement of Judge Kincaid on receiving the money that it was accepted in part payment of the sum which he believed was justly due his client, and also without prejudice to his right to appeal, is a fair statement of the law which governed the proceedings in which the money was paid.<br\/><br\/>As we have already said, there was no consideration for giving the paper any other significance than that already stated.\u00a0 The use of the voucher could have been objected to by the defendant, as he had a right to ask that he be paid in legal tender.\u00a0 The acceptance of the voucher was merely an accommodation, a favor extended to the city by the defendant.\u00a0 No one has lost anything by the use of the voucher; no one has changed position to his injury.\u00a0 The city lost nothing; the owner gained nothing.\u00a0 The motion is denied.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

DeWitt, attorneys for defendant and judgment debtor.\u00a0 On the 9th of September the plaintiff and judgment creditor presented another motion, supported by affidavits, alleging that the judgment debtor was about to dispose of his property with intent to defraud his creditors and asked that a writ of attachment be issued against the property of said debtor.\u00a0 This mode of procedure was made necessary, says the judgment creditor, by the fact that the motion for a new trial was pending and execution could not be issued until it was disposed of, and certain creditors of the judgment debtor were availing themselves of the delay occasioned by the filing of defendant's motion for a new trial to purchase all of the property of the judgment debtor and to apply it on their indebtedness and thus prevent the judgment creditor from reaching it by ordinary legal process.<br\/><br\/>Upon the filing of plaintiff's petition for a writ of attachment the court, instead of granting the writ, found that good grounds existed for the immediate issuance of execution and so ordered, it being provided that execution be stayed on the presentation of a supersedeas bond by the judgment debtor.\u00a0 Execution was accordingly issued on the 9th day of September and immediately placed in\u00a0 the hands of the sheriff.\u00a0 While the execution of the judgment was in suspense, owing to the pendency of the motion for a new trial above referred to, and on the 8th day of September, 1911, Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Limited, Forbes, Munn &amp; Co., and the judgment debtor, with full knowledge of the\u00a0 plaintiff's judgment and the efforts being made to collect it, came together and prepared a document by means of which the judgment debtor acknowledged himself indebted to Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Limited, in a certain sum, and for the purpose of paying and satisfying this debt, assigned and transferred all his property to Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Limited, it being stipulated that the said Tan Pian should be responsible for the payment of all his obligations excepting only that referred to in the instrument.\u00a0 Forbes, Munn &amp; Co. were not parties to this instrument and did not openly appear in the transaction, but there was some evidence that there was an agreement between this firm and the judgment debtor and Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Limited, that Forbes, Munn &amp; Co. should participate in the proceeds of the property which the judgment debtor conveyed to Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Limited.\u00a0 The only property possessed by the judgment debtor was that so conveyed to Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Limited, and, consequently, the only remedy of the judgment creditor, if any, was to have the conveyance set aside and the debtor's property subjected to his judgment.<br\/><br\/>The sheriff in attempting to levy the execution issued on the Manila Trading and Supply Company's judgment found a representative of Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Limited, in possession, but proceeded nevertheless to levy upon the property and sell the same.\u00a0 The return made to the court after the sale showed a deficiency and the judgment creditor thereupon, by supplementary proceedings, brought Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Limited, arid Forbes, Munn &amp; Co. into court for the determination of the validity of the so-called sale from the judgment debtor to Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Limited.\u00a0 Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Limited, then brought this action against the sheriff.\u00a0 By order of court the two proceedings were consolidated and trial was had resulting in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for P1,610.32, the trial court finding that the conveyance in question was valid.\u00a0 Both parties appealed.<br\/><br\/>The learned trial court stated the question before it as follows:\u00a0 \"These two proceedings were by agreement tried together, both involving a bill of sale (Exhibit A) executed on September 8, 1911, by the defendant in cause No. 8544 to the plaintiff in cause No. 8977.\u00a0 On September 2 a judgment had been rendered in the original cause No. 8544 (of which the present is a mere supplementary\u00a0 proceeding) in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for P7,224.22.\u00a0 The judgment creditor now seeks to have said bill of sale set aside as fraudulent, invoking in his behalf the presumption imposed by article 1297 of the Civil Code. That said presumption arises in this case is unquestionable, but it is a presumption only and may be rebutted by evidence that the sale was in fact bona fide and valid.\"<br\/><br\/>It is undisputed that the judgment debtor owed the vendee about P28,000 and that the sale of the property in controversy was made in partial consideration of said indebtedness.\u00a0 As the goods are not claimed even in the complaint in cause No. 8977 to be worth more than P5,000, and as the judgment creditor contends that they were worth less, than one-third of that sum, it will be seen that the transfer which is sought to be set aside covered a very small part of the undisputed indebtedness upon which the property transferred was applied.<br\/><br\/>Under such circumstances was the bill of sale, so-called, of the goods here in controversy, given in satisfaction <i>pro tanto<\/i> of the said debt of P28,000, a fraud upon the creditors of the judgment debtor?<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that it was not.\u00a0 This case cannot be distinguished from that of Pe\u00f1a <i>vs<\/i>. Mitchell (9 Phil. Rep., 587).\u00a0 In that case the facts and the nature of the action sufficiently appear in the following quotation:<br\/><blockquote>\"As appears in the fourth finding of facts, judgment in the 'first instance' had been rendered against P. B. Florence prior to the date of the sale to the plaintiff, and the court properly held that the presumption of fraud attached to said sale by virtue of the above-cited provisions of article 1297 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 But\u00a0 it will be observed that these provisions raise no more than a presumption of fraud which may be overthrown by competent testimony.\u00a0 Under the second finding of facts, the trial court found that the valuable consideration passing from the plaintiff purchaser to P. B. Florence and wife was the cancellation of a lawful indebtedness existing at the time of the sale; that this indebtedness actually existed and amounted to considerably more than P12,000; and that the object of the plaintiff in making the purchase of the property in question, valued at not more than P15,000, was to secure herself from loss of the amount which the said P. B. Florence was indebted to her.\u00a0 If there were no other facts in the case, these\u00a0 facts would be amply sufficient to rebut the presumption of fraud.<br\/><br\/>\"The trial court, however, was of opinion that the other facts proven at the trial tended to establish the fraudulent character of the sale, and sustain the presumption of fraud established by the provisions of article 1297.\u00a0 These facts may be summarized as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"First.\u00a0 That at the time when the sale was made the vendor was insolvent, being indebted to other creditors than the plaintiff; that as a consequence the purchaser received payment in full for her debt while the remaining creditors received nothing.\u00a0 In other words, that the insolvent debtor by the terms of the contract with the plaintiff preferred one creditor over another in making the payment of his debts.<br\/><br\/>\"Second.\u00a0 That the plaintiff, the preferred creditor, was the mother-in-law of the debtor.<br\/><br\/>\"But there is ho provision of existing law which forbids the preferring of one creditor over another by an insolvent debtor at his election, whether the preferred creditor be a relative or otherwise.\u00a0 Section 524 of Act No. 190 provides that:<br\/><br\/>\" 'No new bankruptcy proceedings shall be instituted until a new bankruptcy law shall come into force in the Islands.\u00a0 All existing laws and orders relating to bankruptcy and proceedings therein are hereby repealed\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.'<br\/><br\/>\"Thus all those bankruptcy provisions of the Civil Code, whereby an insolvent debtor was prohibited from making discriminations in favor of or against particular creditors, are repealed.\u00a0 The language of this section of Act No. 190 is so sweeping in its terms that it leaves no room\u00a0 for doubt as to its meaning or its effect, wherever a question arises as to its application.<br\/><br\/>\"We are not unaware of, the grave consequences entailed by a holding that there is no provision of law prohibiting an insolvent debtor from preferring one\u00a0 creditor over another in the payment of his debts; but this holding is a necessary consequence of the above-cited\u00a0 provisions of Act No. 190, enjoining the institution of bankruptcy proceedings 'until a new bankruptcy law shall come into force in the Islands.'<br\/><br\/>\"It appears therefore that the sale of the property in question was\u00a0 made to the plaintiff by the lawful owner thereof; that the parties to the sale were competent to enter into the contract; that there is no provision of law which forbade the execution of the contract by the parties; that the vendor was lawfully\u00a0 indebted to the plaintiff, in an amount equal to or nearly equal to the value of the property sold; and that this indebtedness was the consideration which passed to the vendor, and was an adequate and a valuable consideration therefor.<br\/><br\/>\"The presumption of fraud attaching to the sale of the property in question being overthrown by the evidence of record, the plaintiff is clearly entitled to the possession of the property in question.\"<\/blockquote>From this quotation it is clear that there is no distinction between the case at bar and that one except, possibly, that, in the case at bar, there is more evidence of an intent to prevent the plaintiff in this case from collecting his judgment; or, perhaps it is more nearly correct to say that there is in this case clearer evidence of knowledge on the part of the persons engaged in the transfer as to the existence of other creditors and the effect which the transfer would have on them, particularly the judgment creditor; and there was a little sharper competition for the prize in this case than in that.\u00a0 But, under that case, we do not regard the intentions of the parties, good or bad, if they are properly called intentions, with respect to the other creditors of the vendor, or the fact that the competition between the contestants for the payment of their respective claims was extremely sharp, as having any bearing upon the validity of the transfer, provided it is clear that the property was really transferred for the purpose of satisfying, or of partially satisfying, the debt which the vendor owed to the vendee at the time and said debt was actually wholly satisfied or satisfied to the extent of the value of the property.\u00a0 If there was a debt actually existing, and if the transfer from the debtor to the creditor was real in the sense that the title actually passed and\u00a0 that the debt-to that extent was extinguished, then, under the case of Pe\u00f1a <i>vs<\/i>. Mitchell, the\u00a0 intention of the transferor and the\u00a0 transferee to deprive other creditors of any recourse or recovery against the vendor is of no consequence.\u00a0 The same result is obtained whatever be the intentions of the parties with respect to the other creditors.\u00a0 If the transfer was real and the title passed, if there was a real debt and by the transfer it became extinguished <i>pro tanto<\/i>, the transaction was legal no matter what the effect may have been on other creditors.<br\/><br\/>The case of Pe\u00f1a <i>vs<\/i>. Mitchell was carefully considered and the question involved thoroughly discussed not only upon the original decision but also upon a motion for a rehearing.\u00a0 The question as to the preference of creditors, of bankruptcy arid all of the other elements which, under law entirely Spanish, might have had their influence upon the question before the court, was there fully considered and decided.\u00a0 We, therefore, have nothing to do but to follow that decision.<br\/><br\/>The case of Oria <i>vs<\/i>. McMicking (21 Phil. Rep., 243), cited by the appellant in this case, is not applicable.\u00a0 That was a sale rather than a payment\u2014a sale instead of a preference of one creditor over another.\u00a0 There the\u00a0 sale was not only without proper consideration but was simulated.\u00a0 Here the transfer as well as the consideration is unquestioned.\u00a0 In that case the question of preference did not arise.\u00a0 It is clear that even though there be, apparently, a valuable and adequate consideration for a sale, if there is no sale in reality, but the parties simulate one for the purpose of covering a situation, there is no sale at all and that the transaction is not\u00a0 only fraudulent as to consideration but simulated as to fact.\u00a0 There was no <i>bona fides<\/i> as to any part of the transaction. <\/div>",

PASCUALA LOZADA ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES,<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This appeal was raised, through a bill of exceptions, by counsel for Gregorio, Mateo, and Antonio Jimenez and Isabel Guevara, from the judgment rendered on June 1, 1910, whereby the Honorable Simplicio del Rosario, judge, denied the motion to set aside the judgment rendered by the justice of the peace of Las Pi\u00f1as, dissolved the temporary injunction granted on April 3 Of the previous year, and ordered that the record of proceedings be returned to the said justice of the peace court, which had forwarded it to the Court of First Instance, and that the justice of the peace be advised that in the future, as in the present case, he must admit an appeal whenever the fees therefor and the proper bond were furnished, nor should he require payment of the sum to which the appellant was sentenced for accounts distinct from rentals stipulated between landlords and tenants.<br\/><br\/>By a written motion of March 29, 1909, Gregorio Jimenez, for himself and his codefendants, petitioned the Court of First Instance:\u00a0 (1) To set aside and reverse the judgment rendered by the justice of the peace in the case prosecuted by Pascuala Lozada against the appellants over the unlawful detainer of a parcel of land; (2) to order a new trial in the Court of First Instance, as though the case were on appeal; (3) to issue a temporary injunction against the said plaintiff and the justice of the peace who rendered the judgment, prohibiting, until further order and after filing of bond, further procedure tending to affirm the same;,and (4) to require from the justice of the peace the record in the case; alleging that when the suit was filed in the justice of the peace court, the defendants, on March 13, 1909, interposed a demurrer (Exhibit B), which was overruled, but the justice of the peace ordered\u00a0 the plaintiff to\u00a0 amend his complaint to conform with the demurrer (Exhibit C); that when the case came to trial on the 22d of the same month, the said justice rendered judgment contrary to the weight of the evidence, sentencing the defendants to restore to the plaintiff possession of the land (Exhibit D), instead of absolving the defendants or suspending the proceedings and certifying the cause to the Court of First Instance, as prescribed by section 3 of Act No. 1627, since it was disclosed that it was not a case of unlawful detainer, but a question of ownership, or simply of possession, according to the\u00a0 9th question, paragraph 4, of the Attorney-General's opinion of November 28, 1906; that an appeal (Exhibit E) was filed within five days after entry of the judgment, but the justice of the peace disallowed the same and required the exorbitant bond of P1,200 when it could not have exceeded P500, in view of the fact that the losses and damages were assessed at P345, with the costs,\u00a0 of both instances; that, on March 26, 1909, and within the aforesaid five days, the defendant, with two bondsmen, again\u00a0 presented before the justice of the peace his written petition for appeal, the documents attesting the solvency of his two bondsmen for the sum of P1,200, and P16 as court fees; but the justice of the peace refused also to admit it or the bond offered with the said amount, because the defendants then and there failed to pay the sum of P345 specified in the judgment as losses and damages; that, in spite of the defendant's petition, made upon his appearance before the justice of the peace, that the latter embody in some order his denial of the defendant's previous petitions, the said justice likewise disallowed this petition, stating that he was not obliged to issue an order denying or admitting written motions for appeal; and that therefore the legal period allowed by law for the filing of the appeal had elapsed, and the defendants were, by fraud, mistake, accident, or excusable negligence, prevented from filing an appeal, and they invoked sections.\u00a0 148 to 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>By order of April 3 of the same year, the Court of First Instance directed the aforesaid justice of the peace to suspend all proceedings in the case until further order and to forward the record thereof to the Court of First Instance, provided that the defendants furnished a bond of P400.<br\/><br\/>Upon the petition of the appellants, the court, by order of February 2, 1910, declared the plaintiff, Pascuala Lozada, in default and directed that the justice of the peace of Las Pi\u00f1as be included in the case as one of the defendants, and a summons was issued upon him.\u00a0 By another order of April 5, 1910, issued at the request of the same appellants, the justice\u00a0 of the peace of Las Pi\u00f1as, Simon Villa-real, was declared to be in default and a day was set for the hearing of the default proceedings against the defendants.<br\/><br\/>At this stage of the case, on June 1, 1910, the judgment under consideration was rendered, exception whereto was taken by counsel for the appellants, Gregorio Jimenez et ah, who also moved in writing for a new trial.\u00a0 This motion was denied, whereupon the appellants filed the proper bill of exceptions, which was approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>This is a question of a special remedy sought from the Court of First Instance of this city, for setting aside the judgment which was rendered by the justice of the peace of the municipality of Las Pi\u00f1as at the oral trial of the case prosecuted by Pascuala Lozada against Gregorio Jimenez et al., over unlawful detainer of a parcel of land and restitution thereof, on the ground that said justice of the peace had refused to admit their appeal, because they had failed to pay the sum of P345, to payment whereof as losses and damages they were sentenced, pursuant to the provisions\u00a0 of section 2 of Act No, 1778, although they had furnished the bond required of them and deposited the sum of P16 as fees for the appeal to the Court of First Instance; also because the defendant Gregorio Jimenez believe himself to be owner of the land in question, citing therefor the provisions of sections 148 to 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>The appeal having been admitted in the Court of First Instance with summons to the plaintiff, Pascuala Lozada, and the justice of the peace that first tried the case, who were declared to be in default for failure to answer the summons, the court in his judgment of June 1 held that the justice of the peace of Las Pi\u00f1as should have admitted the appeal from his judgment rendered at the oral trial, even though the appellants had not paid or deposited in his court the sum of P345, to payment whereof they had been sentenced, and that the bond offered under guaranty of solvent sureties and delivery of P16 as fees for the appeal to the Court of First Instance were sufficient, for the provision relevant to the case in section 2 of Act No. 1778 refers to such defendants as are debtors for rents and are to be ejected, but not to usurpers or detainers of real property.<br\/><br\/>The said provision of section 2 of said Act applicable to the case reads;<br\/><blockquote>\"The appeal shall not be allowed until such obligation has been filed with the justice of the peace and it is proven that at the time such appeal is taken all money found by the judgment to be due from the defendant to the plaintiff, either as rent or as the reasonable value of the use and occupation of the premises, as the\u00a0 case may be, has been paid to the plaintiff or has been deposited in court.\"<\/blockquote>The amount which the defendants were sentenced to pay in the judgment rendered by the justice of the peace was not money due as rent, but was for losses and damages, as recognized in the judgment appealed from, and, pursuant to this judicial declaration, the proper procedure would have been to have ordered the justice of the peace to admit the appeal and carry it forward in the ordinary manner.<br\/><br\/>As the justice of the peace had not previously admitted the appeal filed by Gregorio Jimenez et al,, and as the complaint whereupon Pascuala Lozada's case had been instituted in the justice's court was not reproduced in the Court of First Instance, the latter could not legally try or decide the same matter in second instance, as he has done, on the fundamental issue between the parties, for in view of the objection of Gregorio Jimenez et al. to the procedure of the justice of the peace of Las Pi\u00f1as in refusing to allow the appeal directed to the Court of First Instance; the latter's competency was restricted entirely to deciding the definite point as to whether or not the justice of the peace should have admitted the appeal raised by the defeated defendants to the Court of First Instance, for with this obstacle removed the appeal would go forward in the ordinary way.<br\/><br\/>In order that the Court of First Instance may in second instance try a case prosecuted in a justice of the peace court and pass judgment upon the fundamental issue between the litigants, the appeal must be submitted to him in the manner prescribed by law and the case be reopened through a new complaint in his court, acting in second instance, for without these requisites he cannot lawfully exercise appellate jurisdiction in second instance, and in such case in trying the cause on appeal he will have occasion to decide whether or not the judgment of the justice, of the peace should be set aside, as the appellants request, if not reversed for other legal reasons.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the\u00a0 foregoing, there still remains the question whether, when appeal has been raised through bill of exceptions from the judgment of the Court of First Instance which passed upon and decided the fundamental issue of the case jn the justice of the peace court, without having previously admitted the defeated party's appeal from the judgment therein, this court can act in third instance upon the appeal by the same party from said judgment of the Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>Jimenez's incidental objection to the procedure of the justice of the peace, carried on in the form of a trial in the Court of First Instance, though related to the case in the former, is distinct and independent, with a completely different subject matter, wherefore this court, in taking cognizance of the appeal through bill of exceptions to the judgment rendered in this new\u00a0 trial, does so by virtue of its appellate jurisdiction in second instance, for it is not called upon to settle the fundamental issue tried by the justice of the peace, but to decide the admissibility of the judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance, thereby straightening out the procedure that has varied from the regular course prescribed by law.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the Court of First Instance on the fundamental issue in the suit is completely vord and ineffective, for it was rendered without jurisdiction therefor, and this court in so declaring as a result of the appeal by the interested party does so by virtue of its appellate jurisdiction in second instance, nor\u00a0 can it be said to do so in third instance, since the appeal hereby decided does not refer definitely to the suit tried by the justice of the peace, but to the premature extrajudicial judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from is set aside and the Court of First Instance will provide that the justice of the peace allow said appeal in accordance with law; without special findings as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that the property sold\u00a0 under execution by the sheriff was located and stored in the building in question during the time for which the rent is charged.<br\/><br\/>The claims of Mariano Nubla Co Piaco and Tan Oco fall under the first class of preferred credits in article 1922 of the Civil Code, while the claim of Mariano Velasco falls under the seventh class of this article.<br\/><br\/>The first judgment of the court was rendered on the 7th of March, 1912, distributing the fund <i>pro rata<\/i> between Mariano Nubla Co Piaco and Tan Oco, excluding Mariano Velasco entirely from any participation.\u00a0 Upon motion of the latter a new trial was granted and the case having again been submitted upon the same evidence,\u00a0 the court found that certain property, the proceeds of which amounted to P186, was not claimed by either Mariano Nubla Co Piaco or Tan Oco and that consequently they had no preferential right to this amount, and this sum was\u00a0 awarded to Mariano Velasco; the balance of the fund was distributed <i>pro rata<\/i> among Mariano Nubia Co Piaco and Tan Oco, and Mariano Velasco was excluded from any participation in this balance.<br\/><br\/>This appeal is now prosecuted by Mariano Velasco upon the following assignments of error:<br\/><ol><li>The trial court erred in conceding to the defendants and appellees, Mariano Nubia Co Piaco and Tan Oco, any preference whatsoever in the distribution of the fund in question.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The trial court\u00a0 erred in not allowing the defendant and appellant, Mariano Velasco, to participate<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> pro rata<\/span> in the distribution of the balance of P353.20 in the possession of the sheriff in proportion to his credit.<\/li><\/ol>In support of the first error alleged it is urged by the appellant that the two claimants, Mariano Nubia Co Piaco and Tan Oco failed to identify the particular items of property that had been sold by them to Que Biao Co, and from the record it was not possible to determine what articles had been sold by Mariano Nubla Co Piaco and what by Tan Oco.\u00a0 We find the following language in the decision of the court below on the first trial:<br\/><blockquote>\"But of the goods sold at public auction which remained in the store of Que Biao Co on the date of the attachment, the parts which were obtained from\u00a0 Mariano Nubia Co Piaco and Tan Oco, respectively, were not identified.\u00a0 There is no datum whatever nor proof in the trial record to show what goods were obtained from each of the two creditors, Mariano Nubla Co Piaco and Tan Oco.<br\/><br\/>\"In\u00a0 face of the impossibility to determine what goods were sold that belonged respectively to each one of these creditors, and, consequently, the price obtained for the same at the public auction, particularly since such goods were not sold piece by piece, or separately, according to their respective original owners, the court finds no other, remedy than to award to each of the creditors, out of the sum obtained by the sheriff of the city of Manila, to wit, P539.20, a proportional part of their respective credits.\"<\/blockquote>Thus, upon the first trial the court was unable to determine what goods had been sold by each\u00a0 and consequently did not know the sum which the alleged articles had realized on the public sale.\u00a0 The fund was, therefore, divided between Mariano Nubla Co Piaco and Tan Oco according to their respective claims.\u00a0 The second judgment was rendered upon the same evidence, and the only change we\u00a0 find is that it was held that the claimants, Mariano Nubia Co Piaco and Tan Oco, had not established any claim to P186, and this amount was awarded to Mariano Velasco.\u00a0 The balance was divided <i>pro rata<\/i> as in the\u00a0 first judgment.\u00a0 The property sold by Mariano Nubla Co Piaco and Tan Oco was of the same general character and, while the record does not inform us, we presume it had become so intermingled and mixed that it was not possible to determine the separate articles sold by each.\u00a0 It is evident that a part of this property had been sold by Que Biao Co prior to the attachment proceedings herein, for out of the property sold by the sheriff the court\u00a0 found that only P353.20 \"had been derived from the goods sold by Mariano Nubla Co Piaco and TanOco, while the record shows that the amount of the goods sold to Que Biao Co by these two claimants was approximately P800.<br\/><br\/>The court appears to have been satisfied from the proof that the goods, the proceeds of which amounted to P353.20, were originaly sold by Mariano Nubla Co Piaco and Tan Oco, but, as we have seen, was unable to determine what goods had been sold by Mariano Nubia Co Piaco and what by Tan Oco; and the fund was divided <i>pro rata<\/i> among them according to their respective claims; in other words, these claimants were unable to establish separately any preferred claim to any part of this fund, but they did establish what the trial court called a <i>joint<\/i> preferred claim as to\u00a0 said P353.20.\u00a0 The appellant contends that, under the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 1922, the claimant must identify, in order to establish a preferred claim of this nature, the specific property bought of the claimant; that such preference attaches only to the\u00a0 funds derived from property the identity of which as proceeding from the creditor is clearly established, and that consequently Mariano Nubla Co Piaco and Tan Oco have not established any preference to the fund in question.<br\/><br\/>Article 1922 enumerates seven kinds of preferred credits.\u00a0 The credits of Mariano Nubla Co Piaco and Tan Oco fall under number one, while those of Mariano Velasco fall under number seven.\u00a0 The lower court held that a credit falling in the first paragraph was entitled to preference over one falling in\u00a0 the seventh.\u00a0 We think that this was error.\u00a0 Article 1922 is nothing more than a general classification of preferred credits and has no reference to the order that preferred credits shall enjoy among themselves when several preferred credits exist against the same property.\u00a0 In a case like the one at bar where three creditors are claiming preferential rights in funds derived from the same property, we must look to the provisions of article 1926 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 It says in part:<br\/><blockquote>\"*\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 When two or more creditors claim preference in respect to certain personal property, the following rules shall be observed as to priority of payment:<br\/><br\/>\"1. Credits secured by a pledge exclude all others, to the extent of the value of the thing given in pledge,<br\/><br\/>\"2. In case there is a security, and it is lawfully constituted in\u00a0 behalf of more than one creditor, the priority amongst them shall be determined by the order of the dates of the execution of the guaranty.<br\/><br\/>\"3. Credits for advances for seeds, expenses of cultivation and gathering, shall be preferred over those for rents and leases, in regard to the fruits of the crop for which they were incurred.<br\/><br\/>\"4. In all other cases, the value of the personal property shall be distributed <i>pro rata<\/i> among the credits which enjoy special\u00a0 preference in regard to the same property.\"<\/blockquote>The credits involved in the present case do not fall within any of the first three paragraphs of this article and it follows, therefore, that the court below was governed by the provisions of the fourth paragraph, which provides that the fund must be distributed <i>pro rata<\/i> among credits not embraced in the first three paragraphs.<br\/><br\/>The conclusion reached by the trial court is of course based on the assumption that the claimants Mariano Nubla Co Piaco and Tan Oco had established their preferential claim.\u00a0 If it be held that they have not established their preferential rights to the fund in\u00a0 question, then the whole of it would go to Mariano Velasco, for his claim is clearly established as a preferred claim, and as a result he would be the only preferred creditor as to the fund.<br\/><br\/>The language used in the case of McMieking <i>vs<\/i>. Tremoya (14 Phil. Rep., 252, see pp. 258 and 259) would indicate that a claimant such as we are discussing must show that the specific personal property found in the possession of the debtor was sold by him and that this particular property has not been paid for in order to establish his preferential rights.<br\/><br\/>The following is from the opinion in that case:\u00a0 \"The mere fact that Lim Buanco owed Holliday, Wise &amp; Co. a sum of money for goods sold and delivered would not justify the said company in entering the store and claiming any of the goods which were there found which they had sold.\u00a0 They must prove that the particular goods were not only sold to the debtor, but that the price of the particular goods selected had not been paid before they were entitled to the right of preference as provided in said article (1922) of the Civil Code.\"<br\/><br\/>The following is from the headnote:\u00a0 \"The money claimed must be due to the alleged creditor as the selling price of the property from which it proceeds; the property must be capable of identification and must be identified as the same property whose selling price is unpaid; and the property upon which the selling price was due must be found in the possession of the debtor.\u00a0 (Torres et al <i>vs<\/i>. Genato, 7 Phil. Rep., 204; Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino <i>vs<\/i>: Peterson, 7 Phil. Rep., 409, 413; Fidelity and Deposit Co., etc.,\u00a0<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> vs.<\/span> Wilson, 8 Phil. Rep., 51; Rubert &amp; Guamis <i>vs<\/i>.

Rep., 435, 436.)\"<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar, as we have said, apparently Mariano Nubla Co Piaco and Tan Oco have shown that certain goods, the proceeds of which amounted to P353,20, were the particular goods sold by them <i>separately<\/i> and that these particular goods have not been paid for; but they were unable to show <i>what particular goods were sold by each<\/i>.\u00a0 Paragraph 1 of article 1922 clearly intends that the claimant shall have a preference as to the <i>specific<\/i> property sold and unpaid for.\u00a0 In the present case the lower court gave each of the claimants a preference over <i>the whole<\/i> and distributed the fund <i>pro rata<\/i> according to the amount of their respective claims.<br\/><br\/>We do not regard this holding as correct.\u00a0 We do not forget, however, that in the present case only two vendors present claims; that the court found that they had separately sold certain property to the debtor; that part of the property sold by the sheriff had come from one claimant and part from the other.\u00a0 The trouble is, however, that they have not shown what <i>particular property<\/i> came from <i>each<\/i>.\u00a0 The right to preference depends upon the ability to identify the property.\u00a0 That is a condition precedent to a legal right.\u00a0 If each of the two selling creditors had confronted Velasco separately, could he have maintained his alleged preference ? Certainly not.\u00a0 The reason is that he could not <i>identify<\/i>, the primary essential.\u00a0 But is the identity of the property any more established when both confront him together? Can either one lay his hand upon a piece of property and say that he sold it to the debtor?\u00a0 They dealt with the debtor separately.\u00a0 They must deal with his creditors the same way.\u00a0 If this were not the rule a merchant would always have preferred creditors of this class who, in combination, would take all the assets.<br\/><br\/>The creditor Mariano Velasco is entitled to be paid first out of the funds.\u00a0 The other two creditors shall be paid next <i>pro rata<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Judgment reversed, and trial court ordered to enter judgment in\u00a0 accordance herewith.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Torres, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur. <\/div>",

that the two years within which the defendants might repurchase said parcels of land had elapsed; that the defendants had not repurchased said parcels of land.\u00a0 The plaintiff prayed that she be declared to be the owner and entitled to the possession of the parcels of land in question and that the defendants be required to pay her three hundred <i>manojos de palay,<\/i> together with the sum of P250 as damages.<br\/><br\/>To said complaint the defendants presented\u00a0 a demurrer which was overruled\u00a0 by the lower court.\u00a0 Whereupon the defendants presented an answer in which they admitted the execution and delivery of said contract (Exhibit\u00a0 A), but insisted that said contract was not a <i>pacto de retro<\/i>; that it was a simple mortgage; that before the maturity of said contract (the 10th day of December, 1910), they had offered to pay to the plaintiff the amount due under the said contract; that the plaintiff requested them to defer the payment of the amount due under said contract (the sum of P500) until the month of February, 1911; that in the month of February, 1911, in accordance with said agreement, they had offered to pay to the plaintiff the amount due under said contract, together with three hundred <i>manojos de palay<\/i>, the amount of the rental; that the plaintiff had refused to accept said money or said <i>palay<\/i>; that in view of the refusal of the plaintiff to accept the amount due under said contract, they had deposited the same with the justice of the peace; that the value of the parcels of land was P2,000.\u00a0 The defendants prayed that they be relieved from any responsibility under said complaint, that the plaintiff pay to them the sum of P300 as damages, and that the court declare null and void said contract, Exhibit A.<br\/><br\/>Upon\u00a0 the issue thus formed the Honorable Dionisio Chanco, judge, rendered a judgment in which he held that the plaintiff, by virtue of the provisions of said contract (Exhibit A) and the failure of the defendants to comply with its conditions, had become the absolute owner of said parcels of land, and condemned the defendants to deliver the same to her, together with three hundred <i>manojos de palay<\/i> and to pay the costs.\u00a0 From that judgment the defendants appealed.\u00a0 In this court the defendants make the following assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"The trial court erred:<br\/><br\/>\"I.\u00a0 In overruling the demurrer to the complaint.<br\/><br\/>\"II.\u00a0 In not declaring Exhibit A of the complaint null and void.<br\/><br\/>\"III.\u00a0 In regarding Exhibit A of the complaint as a public document.<br\/><br\/>\"IV.\u00a0 In regarding Exhibit A of the complaint as an instrument of sale with right to repurchase instead of interpreting it as an unregistered instrument of mortgage or as a simple contract of loan with guaranty,<br\/><br\/>\"V.\u00a0 In holding that the vendor did not exercise her right of repurchase during the period fixed in the contract, on the supposition that the instrument were a contract of sale with right to repurchase.<br\/><br\/>\"VI.\u00a0 In rendering judgment in plaintiff's favor instead of absolving the defendants.<br\/><br\/>\"VII.\u00a0 In denying the motion for a new trial of the case.\"<\/blockquote>With reference to the first assignment of error, a careful reading of the complaint shows that the lower court committed no error in overruling the demurrer.\u00a0 The complaint contains upon its face all of the necessary allegations to show a cause of action under the alleged contract.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the second assignment of error, there seems to be no good reason for holding that the lower court committed an error in declaring that Exhibit A was a valid and subsisting document.\u00a0 All of the parties admit that the same was duly signed voluntarily by them and was acknowleged before a notary public.\u00a0 The appellants contend that the notary public was a relative of some of the parties to the contract.\u00a0 No law nor decision of the courts is cited in support of their contention.\u00a0 The mere fact that a notary public, before whom an <i>ordinary<\/i> contract is executed and delivered, is a relative\u00a0 of some of the parties is not sufficient, in the absence of fraud or collusion, to justify the holding that the contract is null.\u00a0 It was executed before a notary public and is therefore a public document.\u00a0 (McMicking <i>vs<\/i>. Kimura, 12 Phil. Rep., 98; Gochuico <i>vs<\/i>. Ocampo, 7 Phil. Rep., 15; Hijos de I. de la Rama <i>vs<\/i>. Robles, 8 Phil. Rep., 712.)<br\/><br\/>What we have said with reference to the second assignment of error seems also to be sufficient to answer the argument of the appellants under the third assignment of error.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the fourth assignment of error an examination of said contract (Exhibit A) is necessary for the purpose of determining or ascertaining whether the same is a <i>pacto de retro<\/i> or a simple mortgage.\u00a0 An examination of said contract discloses that it contains the following significant language, in paragraph 1:<br\/><blockquote>\"I, Catalina Viloria,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 of the Province of Ilocos Sur\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 * an( my children here present, in consideration of the sum of five hundred pesos (P500), Philippine currency, which Do\u00f1a Emiliana Racca has paid us,\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 do hereby record that <i>we sell and transfer in the character of sale with right to repurchase<\/i> the two parcels of land\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.\" <\/blockquote> It would seem to be difficult to find a contract in which its character is more clearly demonstrated than in the language above quoted.\u00a0 It seems to us to be clearly a <i>pacto de retro<\/i> instead of a mortgage or simple contract of loan.\u00a0 The language of\u00a0 the contract itself seems to demonstrate that the lower court did not commit the error alleged in the fourth assignment.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the fifth assignment of error, the plaintiff contends that the defendants did not exercise their right to repurchase the two parcels of land in question within the period prescribed\u00a0 by the said contract.\u00a0 By the terms of the contract it matured on the 10th day of December, 1910.\u00a0 It was the duty of the defendants (the vendors) to complete the repurchase on that,date.\u00a0\u00a0 (Arts. 1509 and 1518, Civil Code.)\u00a0 By their failure to repurchase on that date, unless something existed which excused them, the conditional sale became absolute and they have lost their property.\u00a0 (Art. 1509, Civil Code.)\u00a0 By their failure to repurchase on the date of maturity, in the absence of other facts excusing the repurchase at that time, the conditional sale became absolute.\u00a0 (10 Manresa, 296-307, art. 1509.)\u00a0 That being the rule of law, it becomes necessary to examine the record for the purpose of ascertaining just what the defendants (the vendors) did in their alleged effort to repurchase the lands mentioned in said contract.\u00a0 The defendant, Catalina Viloria, testified that she sent her son and son-in-law, Santiago Villaluz and Victoriano Guerrero, to the municipality of Santo Domingo, the place where the plaintiff lived, for the purpose of notifying her to come to the municipality of Lapog, for the purpose of receiving \"the amount of the repurchase;\" that this was in the month of December, 1910.\u00a0 She fails, however, to give the <i>particular day<\/i> in the month of December when she sent her son and son-in-law to the plaintiff.\u00a0 The fact that Santiago Villaluz and Victoriano Guerrero, in the month of December, 1910,\u00a0 went to the municipality of Santo Domingo, for the purpose of asking or requesting the plaintiff to come to the municipality of Lapog, is supported by the\u00a0 declaration of\u00a0 each of them.\u00a0 Neither of them states the particular day in the month of December when such request was made.\u00a0 They each admit that they did not take the money with them when they went to the municipality of Santo Domingo with which to repurchase the parcels of land mentioned in said <i>pacto de retro<\/i>.\u00a0 They each declare that when they requested the plaintiff to come to the municipality of Lapog that the latter replied that it was unnecessary to repurchase the land in question until after the crops were harvested.\u00a0 The plaintiff denies absolutely the declarations of these witnesses.\u00a0 She declared that the defendants never offered to repurchase the lands under the contract.\u00a0 The lower court found in accordance with the declaration of the plaintiff.\u00a0 Had the defendants shown or proved by proper and sufficient proof that they had done all that was within their power to do at the time of the maturity of the contract to repurchase the lands in question and that they had been prohibited by some act of the plaintiff, then and under such circumstances the courts would permit them to repurchase at a later date.\u00a0 (Lafont vs. Pascasio, 5 Phil. Eep., 391; Villegas <i>vs<\/i>. Capistrano, 9 Phil. Rep., 416; Fructo vs. Fuentes, 15 Phil. Rep., 362; Retes <i>vs<\/i>. Suelto, 20 Phil Rep., 394.)<br\/><br\/>Considering that the lower court saw and heard the witnesses and had an opportunity to judge of their credibility, and reached the conclusion that the defendants had not done what the law required them to do at the time of the maturity of the contract or <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, and in the absence of positive and uncontradicted proof to the contrary, we adopt his finding of facts <i>that the defendants did not, at the maturity of the contract, do what the law required them to do in order to complete the repurchase of the lands in question.<\/i><br\/><br\/>With reference to the sixth assignment of error, after a full consideration of all of the facts found in the record and the law applicable thereto, we find no reason for reversing or modifying the judgment of the lower court.\u00a0 The same is, therefore, hereby affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

That the ordinance in force last year, relating to cockpit license fees in the municipality of San Juan del Monte, was modified by <i>another ordinance passed by the same municipal council.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"2. That, while the new ordinance was pending approval by the provincial board, the plaintiff was allowed to pay the license fee prescribed by the old ordinance, P375, <i>without prejudice to his compliance with the provisions of the new ordinance.<\/i><br\/><br\/>\"3. That the plaintiff paid the said fee to the municipal treasurer of San Juan del Monte, whom the provincial treasurer instructed to receive the amount thereof, until the claim made by the licensee of the cockpit against the municipal council should be finally settled by the provincial board.<br\/><br\/>\"4. That the fee fixed by the municipal ordinance of San Juan del Monte is P4,000 per annum only, and that the P200 is the amount of the license fee required by the Internal Revenue Law to be paid by the cockpit licensee.<br\/><br\/>\"5. That the ordinance passed by the municipal council of San Juan del Monte, fixing\" the fee at P4,000, and against which the plaintiff filed a claim, has been finally approved by the provincial board.\"<\/blockquote>Upon said facts a very interesting opinion by the Honorable Simplicio del Rosario, judge, was filed, dissolving the temporary injunction theretofore granted, and denying the prayer of the plaintiff, the dispositive part of said decision being as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Therefore, the injunction issued against the defendant is dissolved and he is authorized to sell at public auction the cockpit belonging to the plaintiff, should the latter not pay the sum of P675 he owes the defendant in his capacity of provincial treasurer of Rizal, as the difference between the fee of Pl,050 which he is obligated to pay for the first quarter of the present year, and that of P375, which is all he has paid; with the costs against the plaintiff.\u00a0 Said sum of P675, as well as such further part of the fee as the plaintiff may in future owe, may be collected out of the bond given by the licensee's bondsmen, in the event of the latter's delinquency or of the insufficiency of the amount realized from the sale of the cockpit at public auction.\"<\/blockquote>From that judgment the defendant appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>The appellant here presents a very interesting discussion upon the question relating to the time when the ordinance in question took effect.\u00a0 It was adopted by the municipal council on the 31st day of December, 1909, for the year 1910.\u00a0 It was not approved by the provincial board until some time later.\u00a0 Did it take effect on the day of its enactment or on the day of its approval by the provincial board?\u00a0 We deem it unnecessary to discuss this question at this time, for the reason that the plaintiff petitioned for and was granted a license to maintain the cockpit for the year 1910, commencing with the 1st of January, and actually opened and maintained the same from that date.\u00a0 In order to be permitted to open his cockpit on the 1st of January, 1910, he paid the amount of the license fee for the first quarter which had been required under the ordinance of 1909, with the promise to pay the balance when the new ordinance should be approved.\u00a0 His payment was accepted by the municipal authorities and was made by him under the condition that the same should be \"without prejudice to his compliance with the provisions of the new ordinance.\"\u00a0 Except for this promise to pay the balance due under the new ordinance when the same should be approved, on the part of the plaintiff, certainly he would not have been permitted to open his cockpit on January 1, 1910.\u00a0 Considering the express promise of the plaintiff to pay the full amount fixed by the ordinance for the license to open his cockpit for the year 1910, when the same should be approved, and considering the fact that he was actually permitted to open his cockpit on January 1, 1910, with that understanding, we find nothing in the record which justifies a reversal of the judgment of the lower court, and, without discussing the other questions presented by the appellant, the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Abreu, judge, sentenced the defendant, convicted of the crime of robbery with homicide, to the penalty of death by hanging:, to pay an indemnity of P1,000 to the heirs of the deceased, and to the payment of one-half of the costs, and dismissed the case with respect to the other defendant,\u00a0 Benito Escamante, with the\u00a0 other one-half of the\u00a0 costs <i>de oficio<\/i>.\u00a0 It was furthermore therein ordered that an investigation be made by the fiscal to ascertain whether Apolonio Salasayo took part in the crime under prosecution, in order that, should it be found that he did, the proper information and other proceedings might be filed against him.<br\/><br\/>On or about the 17th of January, 1912, at a late hour of the previous night or early in the morning of this\u00a0 date, Leonardo Bulfa, accompanied by a neighbor of his, Benito Escamente, went from a hill near the pueblo of Ayuquitan, Oriental Negros, to the vicinity of the house of Filomeno Catipay and Vicenta Salasayo, situated in the barrio of Siapo, where they were met by Apolonio Salasayo, a brother of Vicenta, and immediately thereupon\u00a0 Bulfa, by a palmleaf torch, set fire to Catipay's house on the side next to the stairs.\u00a0 The spouses inhabiting the dwelling, being awakened by its burning, at once endeavored to put out the fire and for this purpose the husband, Catipay, tried to climb to the roof of the house.\u00a0 Just at this moment Bulfa gave him a lance-thrust in the side, toward the shoulder, as a result of which he fell heavily to the floor and died within a few moments.\u00a0 Directly after this assault the defendant, Bulfa, forced his way into the house by breaking the door and, by threats, compelled the wife of the deceased to show him the money the spouses had stowed away; this was found in a palm-leaf sack under a heap of corn and more than P1,000 of it was taken by the robber.\u00a0 Immediately after the robbery Bulfa left with Escamante.\u00a0 Apolonio Salasayo had already departed from the scene of the crime.\u00a0 The house, together with the corn and other effects therein contained, was reduced to ashes, and, including its contents, was worth about P500.<br\/><br\/>Upon the foregoing facts, and after the proper preliminary examination had been made, the provincial fiscal filed an\u00a0 information in the Court of First Instance of Oriental Negros, on September 27, 1912, charging Leonardo Bulfa and one named Benito with the crime of robbery with homicide; and, after trial, the judgment aforementioned was rendered.<br\/><br\/>The case at bar concerns a horrible crime which indicates the highest degree of wickedness on the part of its perpetrator.<br\/><br\/>The trial record discloses full proof of the commission of the complex crime classified in the Penal Code as robbery with homicide, which is an exceedingly serious one and severely punished in article 503 of the Code by two indivisible penalties, <i>cadena perpetua<\/i> to death.\u00a0 It is unquestionable that the unfortunate\u00a0 Filomeno Catipay was violently killed at the time his house was set on fire by the perpetrator of so ferocious an assault made with the purpose of robbing the victim, and that all the aforerelated facts were premeditated and carried into execution one after the other, but connectedly, with the sole intent of robbery, for the deceased and his wife, Vicenta Salasayo, together with their young son, being asleep in their house built of bamboo and straw, were awakened at a late hour of the\u00a0 night, between the 16th and 17th of January, 1912, by the heat they felt from the fire that was making its way into the house, to extinguish which the husband directed\u00a0 the wife to get some water, while he endeavored to climb up the wall to reach the burning roof and at this juncture received a lance-thrust in his side, toward the shoulder, inflicted from the outside and through the wall.\u00a0 As a result of this injury Filomeno Catipay fell heavily to the floor of the house, mortally wounded, and for this reason his wife desisted from getting the water.\u00a0 Thereupon a man entered the house by forcing the door, which was closed, and, bolo in hand, threatened Vicenta Salasayo with death and commanded her to disclose the place where their money was kept.\u00a0 The woman, stricken with terror and fright, designated a place under a heap of corn where there was a sack that contained more than P1,000, the savings of many years, and the robber, whom she\u00a0 then recognized, after taking possession of the money, left the premises, but not before the woman had succeeded in escaping with her son, for nearly the whole house was in flames.\u00a0 The clothes, corn, and other effects contained\u00a0 in the building and worth about P500 were burned.\u00a0 The robber, who turned out to be Leonardo\u00a0 Bulfa, together with his companion, Benito Escamante, who was outside of the house on the stairs, then left the place and went to Mount Bayauan where they divided the stolen property.<br\/><br\/>It is undeniable that the facts above related must be classified as robbery with homicide, inasmuch as the hapless Catipay was killed for the purpose of robbing him, free from all danger and without the possibility of the least resistance.<br\/><br\/>On the following day, the 18th, the widow of the deceased denounced the crime to the justice of the peace of the pueblo of Ayuquitan and a warrant was issued for the arrest of Leonardo Bulfa as the principal perpetrator of the deed, for he was recognized by the woman Vicenta at the time of the robbery as she had previously known him through his having been a resident of the barrio where the offended parties resided.\u00a0 Criminal proceedings were afterwards instituted against the defendant, who entered a plea of not guilty, though he did not testify in the case; and notwithstanding the unproved allegations of his counsel, the trial record furnishes complete and convincing proof of his guilt as the principal perpetrator of the crime under prosecution.\u00a0 This conclusion is strengthened by the testimony of Benito Escamante who testified that some days prior to the date of the crime he, upon the defendant's invitation, accompanied him from the barrio of Amio of the pueblo of Tolon, Negros Oriental, to the pueblo of Ayuquitan, barrio of Siapo, where the house of the deceased was situated) that two days afterwards at a late hour of the night between the 16th and\u00a0 17th, upon their arrival in the vicinity of the house robbed, where they were joined by Apolonio Salasayo, a brother of the widow, the defendant set fire to the said house, whereupon Apolonio left; that just at the moment the deceased, Catipay, was climbing up the wall of the house to the burning roof, the defendant Bulfa struck him a thrust with a lance from the outside through the wall and immediately thereafter forced open the door and entered the house to commit, through intimidation, the robbery of money aforementioned.\u00a0 This testimony of Benito Escamante, corroborated by Vicenta Salasayo, both of them eyewitnesses to the acts committed by Leonardo Bulfa, proves in a satisfactory manner and beyond all doubt the direct participation of the defendant as the sole proved actual perpetrator, fully convicted, of the said complex crime of robbery with homicide, inasmuch as he alone it was who conceived and planned its execution, for which purpose he invited Benito Escamante to accompany him, and, in going to the place of the crime, was provided with a lance and a bolo; with the lance he treacherously assaulted the unfortunate Catipay on an occasion when the latter was busy with the fire and did not expect that a lance would be thrust through the wall from the outside to inflict upon him a fatal wound; and with the bolo he entered the burning house, threatened and intimidated the wife of the deceased to compel her to disclose the place where the money was kept at which time he was perfectly recognized by her as an old acquaintance.\u00a0 No weight whatever can be given to the allegations of the defense to the effect that the defendant committed the crime by order of his brother-in-law, Apolonio Salasayo, and that Vicenta delivered the stolen money to the defendant in order that he might not kill her or denounce her brother.\u00a0 These averments were wholly unsustained at trial and completely disproven by the positive testimony of the offended party Vicenta Salasayo and the witness Escamante.<br\/><br\/>Account must be taken of the attendance of the aggravating circumstances that the homicide was committed with treachery, in the small hours of the night, and in the midst of the silence and darkness thereof, in an inhabited house, and by means of the burning of a house or home in which the defendant was not unaware there were inhabitants.<br\/><br\/>Thus, four aggravating circumstances are to be considered in applying1 the penalty prescribed by law, to wit, Nos. 2, 4, 15, and 20 of article 10 of the Penal Code, with no mitigating one to offset their effects.\u00a0 Owing to the nature of the complex crime in question, the special circumstance established in article 11 of the Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 2142, is not applicable, and although it were, it would offset but one of the said aggravating circumstances, three of which would still subsist and determine the imposition of the adequate penalty in the maximum degree, in accordance with rule 1 of article 80 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from are deemed to have been refuted, it is proper to affirm, and we hereby do, the said judgment, with the costs against the appellant, and the death penalty imposed shall be executed in accordance with law.\u00a0 In case of pardon, and unless specifically remitted therein, the defendant shall also be considered to have been sentenced to the accessory penalties prescribed in article 53 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

WILSON, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This action was instituted by William Clark for\u00a0 the recovery of P2,000 from the defendant, James J. Wilson, under the provisions of sections 4 and 5 of the general immigration law of 1907.\u00a0 The lower court rendered judgment for the amount prayed for and the defendant appealed.<br\/><br\/>Section 4, the last two provisos contained in section 2, and section 5 of the Act of February 20, 1907, are as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 4.\u00a0 That it shall be a misdemeanor for any person, company, partnership, or corporation, in any manner whatsoever, to prepay the transportation or in any way to assist or encourage the importation or migration of any contract laborer or contract laborers into the United States, unless such contract laborer or contract laborers are exempted under the terms of the last two provisos contained in section two of this Act.<br\/><br\/>(SEC. 2.) \"<i>And provided further<\/i>,\u00a0 That skilled\u00a0 labor may be imported if labor of like kind unemployed cannot be found in this country:\u00a0 <i>And provided further<\/i>,\u00a0 That the provisions of this law applicable to contract labor shall not be held to exclude professional actors, artists, lecturers, singers, ministers of any religious denomination, professors for colleges or seminaries, persons belonging to any recognized learned profession, or persons employed strictly as personal or domestic servants.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 5.\u00a0 That for every violation of any of the provisions of section four of this Act the persons, partnership, company, or corporation violating the same, by knowingly assisting, encouraging, or soliciting the migration or importation of any contract laborer into the United States, shall forfeit and pay for every such offense the sum of one thousand dollars, which may be sued for and recovered by the United States, or by any person who shall first bring his action therefor in his own name and for his own benefit, including any such alien thus promised labor or service of any kind as aforesaid, as debts of like amount are now recovered in the courts of the United States; and separate suits may be brought for each alien thus promised labor or service of any kind as aforesaid. And it shall be the duty of the district attorney of the proper district to prosecute every such suit when brought by the United States.\"<\/blockquote>But one assignment of error is made by counsel for the appellant, which reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"The judgment rendered is contrary to the law and the evidence.\"<\/blockquote>The discussion in the brief of counsel is confined solely to the point that Clark, being a \"journeyman pattern maker,\" was a skilled laborer, and that therefore the defendant was not liable for inducing him to immigrate to this country. Counsel do not even suggest, except as stated in the alleged error, in their argument before this court, that the defendant did not enter into a contract with the plaintiff while the latter was in Scotland, in which it was agreed that the plaintiff should come to this country and perform cheap, unskilled labor for the defendant, and that in pursuance of this contract the plaintiff did come to Zamboanga and perform such labor. Neither do counsel contend that even admitting that the plaintiff was a skilled laborer and came to this country to pursue and did pursue his vocation, that the defendant attempted to show that unemployed pattern makers could not be found \"in this country.\"<br\/><br\/>The inquiry arises as to whether or not a skilled laborer who immigrates to this country under contract to perform cheap, unskilled labor, and who does after arriving perform such labor and no other falls within the exempt class.<br\/><br\/>The case relied upon by counsel for the appellant is that of the United States <i>vs.<\/i> Laws (163 U. S., 258; 41 L. Ed., 151).\u00a0 In that case the Circuit Court of Appeals for the sixth circuit certified to the Supreme Court of the United States the following question:<br\/><blockquote>\"Is a contract made with an alien in a foreign country to come to this country as a chemist on a sugar plantation in Louisiana, in pursuance of which contract such alien does come to this country and is employed on a sugar plantation in Louisiana, and his expenses paid by the defendant, a contract to perform labor or service as prohibited in the Act of Congress passed February 26, 1885?\"<\/blockquote>In answering this question, the court, at page 266, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The question presented to us assumes that the individual is a chemist, and that he has come to this country for the purpose of pursuing his vocation as a chemist on a sugar plantation in Louisiana.\u00a0 It may be assumed that the branch of chemistry which he will practice will be that which relates to and is connected with the proper manufacture of sugar from the sugar cane, or possibly from sorghum or beets.\u00a0 He is none the less a chemist, and none the less occupied in the practice of his profession because he thus limits himself to that particular branch, which is to be applied in the course of the scientific manufacture of sugar any more than a lawyer would cease to practice his profession by limiting himself to any particular branch thereof or a doctor by confining this practice to some specialty which he particularly favored and was eminent in.\"<\/blockquote>After an extensive examination of the law, the question was answered in the negative.<br\/><br\/>From the above quotation it clearly appears that\u00a0 the judgment of the court rests upon the proposition that Seeliger went under contract to the United States to follow his vocation as a chemist and not to perform cheap, unskilled labor.\u00a0 In the case at bar, Clark came to the Philippines under contract to perform cheap, unskilled labor and no other.\u00a0 The two cases are quite different.\u00a0 If a skilled laborer abandons his trade or vocation and performs common, unskilled labor, he certainly belongs to the ranks of the latter class while so employed.\u00a0 The law applies not to the past history or accomplishments of the immigrant, but to his purpose in coming to the country.\u00a0 Cheap, unskilled labor performed by a person capable of performing skilled labor of some sort has the same tendency to aggravate the evil the law seeks to mitigate as that performed by a person who has never mastered a trade or profession.\u00a0 The law was intended to apply to the manual laborer as distinguished from the professional man or anyone whose toil is that of the brain.\u00a0 The foregoing reasons are sufficient to dispose of this case.\u00a0 The judgment is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

MARCOS MAGUNDAYAO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal filed by counsel for the plaintiff from the judgment of January 23, 1912, whereby the Honorable Higinio Benitez, judge, absolved the defendant Marcos Magundayao from the complaint and ordered Benita Safont to restore to the plaintiff Dionisio Cabuniag, as judicial administrator of the estate of the deceased Narcisa Gagarino, the ownership and possession of the lot or parcel of land described in the complaint, upon the plaintiff's returning to the defendant Benita Safont whatever sum she may have paid to Roberto Jonas for the mortgage of the said lot; without special finding as to costs, since the plaintiff was allowed to sue as a pauper.<br\/><br\/>By a written petition of April 19, 1911, Dionisio Cabuniag, the administrator of the estate of the deceased Narcisa Gagarino, requested that judgment be rendered by holding to be null and void and\u00a0 of no effect the contracts of the sale executed by Roberto Jonas in favor of Marcos Magundayao and Benita Safont and by ordering these latter to restore to the plaintiff the lands unlawfully sold to them, likewise all the products of the same that they might have obtained therefrom, with the costs against the defendants.\u00a0 In support of his petition he alleged that Narcisa Gagarino was, at the time of her death, the owner of a lot\u00a0 and a piece of coconut land situated in the barrio of Cabay of the pueblo of Tiaong, Province of Tayabas, the respective boundaries, area, and plantings of which were specified in the complaint, and had held them peaceably and quietly, in the quality of owner, for more than thirty years prior to the date of her death, which occurred in February, 1903; that, one month after her death, Roberto Jonas, under the pretense of being her heir, took possession of the aforementioned piece of coconut land and lot and sold the former to Marcos Magundayao and the latter to Benita Safont, when in fact Jonas did not have, either at the time of the sale or of the complaint, any right whatever in the estate of the\u00a0 deceased Narcisa Gagarino, because the latter died intestate and left three legitimate grandchildren, who were her heirs by force of law; and that the purchasers, Magundayao and Safont, immediately after unlawfully taking possession of the property which they had acquired, commenced unduly to derive gain from the products thereof, for the coconut land yielded annually a revenue of P150, the value of the fruit from the trees planted thereon, and the lot rented for P40 per annum.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer\u00a0 interposed by the defendant Magundayao having been overruled, the latter in his answer made a general and specific denial of each and all of the facts alleged in the complaint, except such of them as were in agreement with the following allegations, and set forth that he acquired the said coconut land by purchase from Roberto Jonas, Urbana Jonas, and Paula Gagarino and had lawfully and in good faith held it since then; and that the plaintiff had no right to ask for the annulment of the contract of sale, for the reason that the deceased Gagarino, or her estate, was a third person who had taken no part whatever in the said contract which could not affect the right of ownership alleged by the administrator in the land concerned in the case at bar.\u00a0 In counterclaim he alleged that, as owner and possessor in\u00a0 good faith, he had planted on this land 183 coconut trees, which were growing and were worth P457.50, and <i>gogo<\/i> plants which were worth P25. He therefore prayed that he be absolved from the complaint, with the costs upon the plaintiff, and further that, should judgment be rendered in behalf of the plaintiff, the latter be ordered to pay him P60, the amount expended by the defendant for the purchase of the land, and, in addition\u00a0 thereto, P482.50 for the improvements made thereon in good faith.<br\/><br\/>The other defendants, Benita Safont and Roberto Jonas, though summoned did not appear at the trial; and Benita Safont was declared to be in default, but not so Jonas, who, nevertheless, testified in the case\u00a0 as a witness for the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>In order to decide the claim made by the administrator of the estate of the deceased Narcisa Gagarino, it must be determined whether the land of about \"three cavanes and a half of seed,\" the property sought to be recovered, was of the exclusive ownership of the deceased, and whether any share whatever was held therein by Paula Gagarino, a sister of the deceased Narcisa, and by the brother and sister Roberto Jonas and Urbana Jonas, the nephew and niece, respectively, of the said Narcisa, who appear as the vendors in the document (Exhibit 1), presented by the defendant and expressive of the sale of the said parcel of land, made by the said aunt, nephew, and niece, in favor of the defendant Marcos Magundayao.<br\/><br\/>From the pleadings and proof found in the record, it appears that upon the death, many years ago, of one named Justa, the mother of the sisters Narcisa, Paula, and another whose name is not given in the record and who was the mother of the children Roberto and Urbana, she left among other property a piece of land 12 hectares in area.\u00a0 This land remained undivided among the three heirs of the original owner and after Narcisa Gagarino's death, her sister Paula and her nephew and niece Roberto and Urbana, the children of another sister who it appears also died, sold one-third of the undivided land of joint ownership to the defendant Marcos Magundayao.<br\/><br\/>Upon these premises, the action for recovery of possession brought by the administrator of the estate of the deceased Narcisa Gagarino has for its sole object the recovery of one-third of the said 12 hectares of land; and, on account of this being <i>pro indiviso<\/i> property and the respective part thereof that pertains to each one of its three coowners, the heirs of the original owner, their predecessor in interest, not being individually and separately determined, the fact of the conveyance having been made by Paula Gagarino and the\u00a0 brother and sister Roberto and Urbana Jonas, in representation of their mother, another coheir and coowner of the said <i>pro indiviso<\/i> land, in no way affects nor prejudices the rights\u00a0 of the heirs of the deceased Narcisa Gagarino, inasmuch as two-thirds of the undivided land of common ownership still remain, one of which corresponds to the testate or intestate succession represented by the plaintiff, and the other third, by an unquestionable right, to the said Paula Gagarino and to the brother and sister Roberto and Urbana Jonas, the children of another sister of Narcisa and Paula Gagarino.<br\/><br\/>Paula Gagarino has by herself an undeniable right to one-third of the said 12 hectares of land of common ownership, and the brother and sister Roberto and Urbana Jonas have likewise an indisputable right to another one-third of the same; and therefore, the said Paula Gagarino, Roberto and Urbana Jonas, in selling only one-third of the said land to the defendant Marcos Magundayao, merely exercised their unquestionable right to dispose of their property, whereby apparently no detriment ensued to the heirs of Narcisa Gagarino, inasmuch as the latter was the owner of only one-third of the <i>pro indiviso<\/i> land concerned.\u00a0 Therefore there could be no sanction either in justice or in law for the annulment of the\u00a0 contract of sale whereby the defendant Magundayao lawfully acquired the land referred to in the document Exhibit 1 and which belonged exclusively to those who sold it to him.<br\/><br\/>It is true that Narcisa Gagarino was during her lifetime a coowner and that this right now pertains to her heirs, yet such right of hers did not extend to all the land, but only to one-third of it, and if her coheirs Paula Gagarino and the children of her other sister must respect the rights that belonged to the heirs of Narcisa Gagarino, these heirs are likewise obliged to take notice of those pertaining to Paula Gagarino and to the brother and sister Roberto and Urbana Jonas.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, it was not proved at trial that any apportionment was made among the interested parties of the property that belonged to the common mother named Justa, included in which was the land in question of 12 hectares in area, nor that all this land would have fallen solely to Narcisa Gagarino, to the exclusion of Paula, her sister, and of her nephew and niece, Roberto and Urbana, the children of her other sister; therefore, notwithstanding that the said land was undivided, these three parties last named could very well have sold one-third of the same to the defendant Magundayao, so long as they did not abuse their right by selling the whole of the property and by disposing even of the part that pertained to\u00a0 the heirs of Narcisa Gagarino.<br\/><br\/>As regards the ownership of the lot mortgaged to Benita Safont, we accept the findings of the trial court contained in the judgment appealed from, to wit, that the said lot, on which the deceased Narcisa had built a house and planted an orchard, had belonged to the latter and had been held by her for more than thirty years, and that, if Benita Safont acted in good faith in furnishing money to Roberto Jonas to defray the expenses of the funeral and\u00a0 burial of the said Narcisa Gagarino, under security of the lot aforementioned, it would not be just to oblige such creditress to return to the heirs of the deceased the products or revenues of the lot, as neither did they pay any interest on the amount loaned.<br\/><br\/>The creditress Safont must return to the heirs of the deceased Narcisa the said lot, without its products or revenues, whenever she shall have collected the amount loaned by her without interest for the burial of the said deceased.\u00a0 It is unnecessary to declare null and void the contract or the act of the\u00a0 delivery of the said lot in security for the said loan, for the purpose of the redemption of the property upon payment of the amount loaned.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from are deemed to have been refuted, we hereby hold that there are no grounds for the annulment of the contracts of\u00a0 sale and mortgage aforementioned, and the defendant Marcos Magundayao is absolved from the complaint.\u00a0 Upon payment of the sum loaned by Benita Safont, the latter shall return the said lot to the heirs of the deceased whose estate is represented by the administrator-plaintiff, without special finding as to costs, and to this extent the judgment appealed from is affirmed.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Joson et al. (R. G. No. 7019)<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> that a municipality, under proper charter authority, may\u00a0 adopt ordinances upon subjects already covered by the general law, so long as the ordinance is not repugnant nor in conflict with such general law.\u00a0 The ordinance and general law are\u00a0 not repugnant simply because they are adopted for the same general purpose.\u00a0 Section 33 of Act No. 1147 prohibits the slaughtering of large cattle at the municipal slaughtering house for human consumption or for food without a permit duly secured from the municipal treasurer.\u00a0 Article 41 of Ordinance No. 12 of the municipality of San Fernando, Province of La Union, prohibits the slaughtering of large cattle within said municipality, even though the object should be for sale, without the permit of the president of the municipal board of health.\u00a0 Both the ordinance and the general law prohibit the slaughtering of large cattle without a permit.\u00a0 Said laws are, to this extent, in harmony.\u00a0 The mere {act that a municipality, for the purpose of protecting the health of its people, requires a permit from the president of the municipal board of health for the slaughtering of large cattle, does not contravene nor is it repugnant to the provisions of the general law of the State requiring, for the purposes mentioned in the general law, a permit from the municipal treasurer for the slaughtering of large cattle.\u00a0 The purposes of the two laws are distinct.\u00a0 Many instances might be given showing that an inhabitant of a municipality, before he can do a particular thing or engage ink particular class of business, should secure two permits, one from the municipality and another from the State.\u00a0 For example: Before a citizen of a municipality can engage in the sale of alcoholic liquors he must first secure a license from the State.\u00a0 In order to engage in the sale of intoxicating liquors anywhere in the State he must first obtain a license from the State.\u00a0 In many municipalities, even though he has his license from the State, he cannot engage in the business in the particular municipality without first securing a permit from such municipality.\u00a0 We deem that it requires no citation of authorities to support this doctrine.<br\/><br\/>It has been stated in many decisions that a municipality may adopt only such ordinances as are expressly authorized in its charter, or such as are necessarily implied from such express powers.\u00a0 In view of this limited power of municipal governments, it becomes necessary to examine what are the charter powers relating to the subject before us of the municipality of San Fernando, Province of La Union.\u00a0 The charter of said municipality is found in the Municipal Code (Act\u00a0 No. 82 and\u00a0 its amendments).\u00a0 Upon an examination of said charter we find in paragraphs (<i>r<\/i>) and (<i>s<\/i>) of section 39 that municipal councils, by ordinance, may provide:\u00a0 <br\/><blockquote>\"(<i>r<\/i>) Provide for and regulate the inspection of meat, fruits, \npoultry, milk, fish, vegetables, and all other articles of food.<br\/><br\/>\" (s) Adopt <i>such other<\/i> measures to prevent the introduction and spread of disease as may, from time to time, be deemed desirable or necessary.\"<\/blockquote>It would seem from a careful reading of Ordinance No. 12, with special reference to article 41, that said ordinance was adopted for the purpose of inspecting the foods to be used in the municipality by its people and to prevent the introduction and spread of disease.\u00a0 The purpose of said ordinance seem to fall directly under the provisions of the charter (Act\u00a0 No. 82, section 39, subsections (<i>r<\/i>) and (<i>s<\/i>) and are authorized thereby.\u00a0 Act No. 1147 has for its object a very different purpose from that provided for by said ordinance.\u00a0 In order that we may better understand the questions presented, an examination of the purposes of the two Jaws\u00a0 may be made.\u00a0 An examination of the ordinance, as above stated,\u00a0 clearly shows that its general purpose was to protect the people of the municipality against impure and infected foods.\u00a0 With reference\u00a0 to the purpose of Act No. 1147, this court has already, in the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Toribio (15 Phil. Rep., 85) discussed at length that question.\u00a0 In that case (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Toribio) we reached the conclusion that said Act (No. 1147) was adopted for the express purpose of keeping a complete record of the large cattle of the Philippine Archipelago.\u00a0 Said Act No. 1147 was not adopted for the purpose of protecting the health of the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 In discussing the purpose of said Act in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Toribio, we said :<br\/><blockquote>\"The act primarily seeks to protect the 'large cattle, of the Philippine Islands against theft and to make easy the recovery and return of such cattle to their proper owners when lost, strayed, or stolen.\u00a0 To this end it provides an elaborate and compulsory system for the separate branding and registry of ownership of all such cattle throughout the Islands whereby owners are enabled readily and easily to establish their title; it prohibits and invalidates all transfers of large cattle unaccompanied by certificates of transfer issued by the proper officer in the municipality where the contract of sale is made; and it provides also for the disposition of estrays and animals recovered from the possession of thieves or persons unlawfully in possession, so as to protect the rights of the true\u00a0 owners.\u00a0 All this, manifestly, in order to make it difficult for anyone but the rightful owner of such cattle to retain them in his possession or to dispose of them to others.\u00a0 But\u00a0 the usefulness of this elaborate and compulsory system of identification, resting as it I does on the official registry of the brands and marks on each separate animal throughout the Islands, would be largely impaired, if not totally destroyed, if such animals were permitted to be slaughtered for human consumption without requiring proof of ownership and the production of certificates of registry by the person slaughtering or causing them to be slaughtered, and this especially if the animals were slaughtered privately, or in a clandestine manner, outside of a municipal slaughterhouse.\u00a0 Hence, as it would appear, sections 30 and 33 prohibit and penalize the slaughter for human consumption or killing for food at a municipal slaughterhouse of such animals without a permit issued by the municipal treasurer, and section 32 provides for the keeping of detailed records of all such permits in the office of the municipal and also of the provincial treasurer.<br\/><br\/>\"If, however, the construction be placed on these sections which is contended for by the appellant, it will readily be seen that all these carefully worked out provisions for the registry and record of the brands and marks of identification of all large cattle in the Islands would prove in large part abortive, since thieves\u00a0 and persons unlawfully in possession of such cattle could, and naturally would, evade the provisions of the law by slaughtering them outside of municipal slaughterhouses, and thus enjoy the fruits of their wrongdoing without exposing themselves to the danger of detection incident to the bringing1 of the animals to the public slaughterhouse, where the brands and other identification marks might be scrutinized and proof of ownership required.\"<\/blockquote>It will be seen, therefore, by the foregoing, that the purposes of the two laws are entirely different.\u00a0 In granting a permit to slaughter, the president of the municipal board of health examines into the question of the effect upon the health of the people of the community.\u00a0 The municipal treasurer, in granting a permit, examines into entirely different questions.\u00a0 He examines into the question of the identity of the animal, its ownership, etc.\u00a0 The president of the municipal board of health, in granting his permit, examines into the question only of the physical condition of the animal\u2014whether it is in a physical condition to be used as food.\u00a0 Both laws are highly important for the welfare of the people of the municipality.\u00a0 One goes to protect the people in their property rights, and the other goes to protect the people in their health and comfort.\u00a0 It will be seen, therefore, that the purposes of the laws are entirely different.\u00a0 The requirement under the general law is for an entirely different purpose.\u00a0 A violation of either law is, therefore, a distinct offense from a violation of the other.\u00a0 It would, seem that the contention that the ordinance in question is in conflict with the general law of the State is no more tenable than to say that an ordinance, for example, within the city of Manila, providing that no\u00a0 person shall engage in the traffic of selling intoxicating liquors without a license, is in conflict with the general law of the State, which provides that no person shall engage in such traffic in the State without a license.\u00a0 Under such conditions, if a person should engage in the business of selling intoxicating liquors in the city of Manila without first obtaining a license so to do, he has not only violated the ordinance of the city of Manila and may be punished therefor, but he has also violated the State law and is liable to be punished as well under such law.\u00a0 While the sale in a particular case is the same act, the offense is different.\u00a0 The evidence supporting the charge in one case is necessarily different from the evidence supporting the charge in the other case.\u00a0 In one case the prosecution would show that he was selling liquor without a license in accordance with the ordinance of the municipality.\u00a0 In the other case the evidence would show that the defendant was selling liquor without a license under the general law.\u00a0 The above example is clearly distinguishable from the facts in the cases heretofore decided by this court of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Jose efral. (R. G., No.\u00a0 7118)<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> and United States <i>vs<\/i>. Joson et al. (R.

Trent,\u00a0 held that the plaintiffs were not entitled, either jointly or severally, to an award for improvements or for losses and damages, and dismissed their complaint with the costs against them proportionately, and absolved them from the counterclaim filed by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>On November 20, 1908, counsel for the plaintiffs filed a written complaint with the Court of First Instance of Albay, against Mariano P. Villanueva, wherein it was alleged that each of the plaintiffs had been and still was in possession of a tract of 1,300 hectares of land situated in the Island of San Miguel, Tabaco, Albay, bounded on the north by the sea and the lands of Pedro Cornel, Candido Bonao, Alejandro Broce, Teodora Bondal, Mateo N. and Mariano Bonaobra; on the east and south, by the sea; and on the west, by the lands of Jose Bombales, Gregorio Breza, Jose Buenconsejo, Juan Bueno, Anacleto Bedolio, Gregorio Rebollido, Alejandro Bonreales and Luis Buensalida; that each and all of the plaintiffs, in the belief that they were the owners of the said land, had thereon sown and planted grain and plants of different kinds, erected houses and other buildings and made other improvements, and planted coconuts, cacao, bananas, bamboo, nipa palm, coffee, lemon trees, sugar cane, abaca, <i>anahao, gallang<\/i> and <i>caragomoy<\/i>; that the names of each one of the plaintiffs and the total value of the plantings, crops, buildings and other improvements, were as follows:\u00a0 Miguel Berses, for the value of P22,382; Rufino Bognalos, P6,325; Hipolito Bognalos, P3,665; Valentin Buela, P1,866.50; Arcadio Biraquit, P14,154; Dalmacio Buara, P2,411; Ciriaco Bong;alon, P1,314,50; Fabian Para, P3,258; Doroteo Brosola, P1,854; Francisco Buara, P4,335; Hermogenes Batis, P1,243.50; Ildefonso Buara, P3,827; Fermin Baina, P859; Pantaleon Buban, P1,556; Maximo Buara, P2,787.50; Lucio Bara, P685; Romualdo Buebos, P1,111; Paulino Buara, P1,360; Fermin Broso, P1,300; Alberto Santos, P1,122; Eufrasio Balinbing, P897.50; Norberto Broce, P154; Segundo Biraquit, P1,805.50; Bernardo Biraquit, P2,312; Ruperto Broso, P1,854; Pablo Bolima, P2,178; Fernando Buenconsejo, P864; Amaro Bonagua, P1,729; Sinforoso Madrid, P845; Leon Buison, P3,146.50; Vicente Bolda, P1,726.50; Lorenzo Sarmiento, P662.50; Evaristo Cal, P576; Maximino Bola, P1,285; Agaton Bore, P1,264; Basilio Lanon, P135; Cornelio Buara, P4,654.50; Francisco Brutas, P1,730; Antero Borbe, P3,747; Doroteo\u00a0 Bueno, P333; Juan Brutas, P642; Jose Buara, P1,327; Cenon Lanon, P2,623; Jose Bi\u00f1ocot, P275; Angelo Bucaya, P3,363; Epifanio Cortesano, P3,117; Nicolas Bonagua, P1,043; Florencio Bieri, P290; Francisco Bolima, P938; Hipolito Vergara, P705; Jose Borbe, P258.50; Nemesio Cal, P440; Buenaventura\u00a0 Borcer, P459; Martina Bogay, P613; Graciano Bien, P230; Geronimo Camo, P965; Juan Bonagua, P1,036; Alejandro Bien, P3,094.50; Benito Bog\u00f1albal, P513; Tomas Berlon, P2,559; Pedro Berlon, P1,284.50; Paulino Buara, P1,113; Sotera Bien, P588; Eustaquio Cortesano, P1,359.50; Hermogenes Contrata, P590; Vicente Bueno, P3,330; Juan Bu\u00f1ales, P1,374;\u00a0 Micaela Bu\u00f1aga, P1,750; Jacinto Dato, P859; Candido Bondad, P1,246.50; Simeon Buising, P1,644.50; Arcadio Bonaobra, P1,046; Narciso and Tomas Borboran, P2,371; Miguela Vista, P1,255; Silvino Vara, P800; Teodorico Brutas, P308; Raymundo Bongay, P633; Zuelo Bombeta, P178; Juan Bonagua, P6,962; Pedro Biron, P1,095; Teodoro Burac, P513; Maximo Bohgalon, P2,660; Petrona Bongon, P1,472.50; Petrona Bongosn, P315; Jacinto Brutas, P3,507; Felix Brutas, P1,771; Mariano Bodes, P876.50; Roman Cortesano, P2,093; Januario Busar, P1,169; Damaso Bonete, P4,433; Manuel Borbe, P788; Toribio Bonaobra, P2,040.50; Simeona Bien, P788; Petronilo Bradecina, P1,737; Roman Bolda, P689; Fausto Bredes, P1,919; Jacinto Basmayor, P4,630; Gregorio Prutas, P770; Eugenio Buela, P1,917.50; Sebastian Bordonada, P3,077; Hermenegildo Berlon, P188; Urbano Berlon, P5,568; Severino Borbe, P717; Faustino Duran, P593; Canuto Bu\u00f1ales, P4,088; Francisco Bitago, P1,509; Anastacio Bog\u00f1ales, P1,474; Zacarias Bien P512; Juan Rolisan, P1,990; Clemente Relisan, P519; Teresa Bocaya, P471.50; Brigido Borbe, P708; Bonifacio Bondad, P1,516; Isaac Bontigas, P364; Prudencio Bolima, P1,311; Josefa Bredes, P767.50; EscoJastico Briquillo, P576; Narciso Balingbing, P962; Florentino\u00a0 Barra, P748; Juan Barra, P358; Basilio Borce, P889; Francisco Borac, P330; Rufino Bongay, P3,355; Juan Bueno, P1,504; Florentino Barra, P873; Juan Barra, P297; Pablo Brutas, P790; Mariano Agunday, P711; Mariano Brisuela, P454; Silyino Barra, P957; Lorenzo Bien, P506; Vicente Barra, P437; Julio Bugnalos, P781; Eulogio Brondo, P2,742; Albino Buevos, P661; Gabriel Bueno, P1,758; Apolinario Big-ino, Pl,157; Leon Bueno, P555; Juan Borbe, P1,922; Marcos Bradecina, P7,371; Alberto Bredes, P5,825; Teofilo Burcer, P337; Hermenegildo Marquez, P477; Santiago Bola, P765.50; Mariano Bonagua, P2,022; Nicolas Buensalida, P1,015; Jacobo Buison, P1,641; Juan Bonagua, P1,299; Zacarias Berces, P2,651.50; Panta leon Bueno, P1,939; Candido Bondad, P3,734; Eulalio Bolima, P191.50; Arcadio Bueno, P628; Juan Flores, P1,325; Juan Brosola, P992; Juan Busmayor, P3,069; Marcelino Brosola, P662; Mariano Agunday, P2,774.50; Francisco Bueno, P1,786; Perfecto.

each coffee plant, P5; and each clump of bamboo, P2; that the defendant, Villanueva, knowing that he was the owner of the land in question, did, with notoriously bad faith tolerate and allow each and all of the plaintiffs to continue to make their sowings, plantings, buildings, and other improvements in order that when terminated, he might appropriate the same to himself, to the plaintiffs' prejudice; that the latter, by reason of such bad faith on the part of the defendant, were jointly injured to the amount of P200,000; that he (counsel aforesaid) had set forth in the amended complaint that in the preceding one material errors were committed with respect to the names of some of the plaintiffs, though without specifying what they were; that, subsequent to the said complaint, Villanueva took possession of the land in litigation under the authority of a judicial order given in a final judgment, as a result of which the plaintiffs were ousted from the land and the defendant, Villanueva, appropriated to himself all the sowings, plantings, houses and other improvements, the subject matter of this suit; that the defendant had not paid the plaintiffs the value of the said sowings, plantings, houses and other improvements, which were\u00a0 worth P470,147, and much less the losses and damages aforementioned. Counsel therefore prayed that judgment be rendered by sentencing the defendant, Villanueva, to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of P470,147 and, in addition thereto, P200,000, as losses and damages, and the costs of the case.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, after the demurrer filed by him in answer to the amended complaint had been sustained, denied each and all of the allegations of the complaint in so far as they were not expressly and specifically admitted in his answer, and set forth that he admitted that some of the, plaintiffs had been in possession of\u00a0 the land concerned and were residents of the Island of San Miguel, but denied that they all were such and also the truth of the\u00a0 averments or allegations contained in the other paragraphs of the complaint, and, as a special defense, set forth that some of the plaintiffs had expressly refused to maintain the complaint in the present case; that the greater part of the alleged sowings and plantings were spontaneous and natural products of the land owned by the defendant; that the plaintiffs acted in bad faith and therefore were not entitled to any indemnity, for the possession which they claimed to hold over certain portions of the land in question was of a precarious nature, since they had no bona fide just title and a sufficient length of time had not yet elapsed to enable them to acquire the property; and that the subject of this suit was one that had already been tried in civil cases Nos. 29 and 33, as shown by Exhibits A and B.\u00a0 As a cross complaint and counterclaim he alleged that the plaintiffs, knowing that the defendant, Villanueva, was the owner of, and had obtained title from the state to, the land in question, did, in 1902 and against his will, enter thereon, and possessed themselves of and usufructed the same, in bad faith, until they were ousted by the sheriff in 1908 acting under the authority of a judicial order contained in a final judgment rendered in the said cases, Nos. 29 and 33; that the defendant was by such trespass caused losses and damages through the noncollection of the rents and products of said land during the time of its detention, at the rate of 50 centavos conant, per the reasonable rental value of each hectare occupied by each one of the plaintiffs from\u00a0 the year 1892 until they were ousted in 1908; that the plaintiffs, being aware as they were of the defendant's right and of the title he held, prevented him from the enjoyment of the land and compelled him to employ the services\u00a0 of attorneys, who were required in the Court of First Instance and in the Supreme Court, thereby occasioning him losses and damages, in addition to other expenses, besides loss of time and prevention from cultivating the land and deriving profit therefrom, and that such expenses, losses and damages amounted to P20,000.\u00a0 He therefore prayed that the defendant be absolved from the complaint and that the plaintiffs be sentenced: (1) To pay P20,000; (2) to pay, each of them, 50 centavos per month for each hectare of land\u00a0 occupied by each of them from the year 1892 until they were ousted in 1908; (3) to keep perpetual silence with regard to the land in question, its sowings, plantings, and other improvements; and (4) to pay the costs\u00a0 of the trial.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the plaintiffs, after entering an exception to the ruling admitting the defendant's cross complaint, presented a written answer to the special defense and to the cross complafrit and counterclaim, and set forth that he denied each and all of the allegations contained in the special defense and in the so-called cross complaint and counterclaim, in each and all of their parts, and prayed that the plaintiffs be absolved from the said cross complaint and counterclaim.<br\/><br\/>By a written motion of May 20, 1909, counsel for the plaintiffs stated that, for the purpose of the best understanding and most correct judgment of the facts in this case and to avoid confusion, he considered it necessary and expedient that the court appoint a commission composed of three impartial persons who should proceed to count the houses, sowings and plantings, the subject matter\u00a0 of the plaintiffs' claim,\u00a0 including those of them that had disappeared, if\u00a0 any such there\u00a0 were and\u00a0 could be determined, and suggested that said commission could, should the court so order, count what pertained individually to each plaintiff, or merely the total number of such improvements, for it was necessary that the court should have an inspection made of the said houses, sowings and plantings as soon as practicable, in view of the fact that counsel had been informed that the defendant was causing them to disappear; that, should the court wish to consider the plaintiffs as one single person, they would waive their right to be considered individually and separately, for the purpose of such judgment as might be rendered in their behalf and the counting of the houses, sowings and plantings aforementioned, for they had agreed that, as soon as a favorable judgment should be rendered, they would divide among themselves the amount awarded them thereby, in a manner proportionate to their respective claims; and that, should the defendant object to the appointment of the said commission on account of expenses and the court decide that he could not rightfully be compelled to pay them, the plaintiffs would bind themselves to reimburse the same as costs upon the defeated party.\u00a0 He therefore prayed that the court appoint the said commissioners and have the inspection made, without awaiting the termination of the taking of evidence.<br\/><br\/>By an order of May 24 of the same year, 1909, provision was made among others for the appointment of two special commissioners, one\u00a0 by the plaintiffs and the other\u00a0 by the defendant, for the purpose of inspecting the 1,300 hectares of land on the Island of San Miguel and ascertaining and examining facts relative thereto, in order to enable them to use the same in case they should testify as witnesses in this suit, but without authority to present any report whatever as to the result of such inspection.<br\/><br\/>On page 62 of the bill of exceptions is found an agreement made by the attorneys for the litigants, in regard to the following points:\u00a0 That they admitted that the commission appointed for the taking of evidence might consider all the plaintiffs who had not testified up to date as if they had been presented as witnesses in this suit, with the exception of those in Albay, 35 in number, mentioned by name, who would\u00a0 be presented later, counsel for the defendant assenting that the plaintiffs not excepted should be deemed to have testified; that they had houses, sowings and plantings on the Island of San Miguel; that the improvements specified in the complaint were those there made since 1891 and prior to 1906; that each witness should answer the following question:\u00a0 \"Who did\u00a0 you believe was the owner of the land occupied by you on the Island of San Miguel, at the time that you built your house and made the sowings and\u00a0 plantings now claimed by you in the complaint?\"; that during the time that they were building their houses, sowing, and planting, they were not obliged to suspend their work by Mariano Villanueva or by any other person in his name; that counselfor the defendant admitted that the said plaintiffs, those whose testimony was, by this agreement, to be considered as valid, might testify with regard to the value and number of their respective houses, sowings and plantings, specified in the complaint, and that such testimony should be given the same weight as if it had been taken before the\u00a0 commissioner in open court, should form an integral part of the record in this case and should be considered as having been given by the said plaintiffs individually or separately, but that this agreement was not to be interpreted in the sense that the defendant must admit the facts contained in such testimony.\u00a0 This agreement was approved by the commissioner, Luis Orteza.<br\/><br\/>After a hearing of the case and introduction of evidence by the parties, the court, on January 28, 1910, rendered the judgment aforementioned, exception to which was taken by counsel for the plaintiffs, who filed a written motion for a new trial.\u00a0 This motion was overruled by an order of February 26, 1910,\u00a0 excepted to by plaintiffs' counsel, and, an appropriate bill of exceptions having been presented, the same was approved and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>In March, 1902, case No. 29 was commenced in the Court of First Instance of Albay through a complaint for the recovery of possession made by Mariano P. Villanueva against Miguel Berses and nine other parties as the usurpers of a tract of land of the plaintiff's ownership situated on the Island of San Miguel.\u00a0 Before the complaint was answered the judge, by an order of April 18, 1903, directed that the case be consolidated with another in the same court, designated under No. 33 and prosecuted by the same plaintiff against Alejandro Brusola and three others, also occupants of the said land, for the same purpose of recovering possession of the property.\u00a0 Both cases being thus consolidated, their prosecution was continued as though they were a single one, at the instance of the plaintiff, Mariano P. Villanueva, and against the 14 defendants.<br\/><br\/>Later, by a motion of February 11, 1905, the attorney for the defendants requested the court to rule that the parties named in the complaint as the defendants, besides representing themselves, also represented the other persons interested in the case, under the\u00a0 denomination of \"inhabitants of the Island of San Miguel,\" pursuant to section 118 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and alleged that the interested parties were not only those whose names\u00a0 appeared in the complaint, but also very many otliers who might number more than 3,000 persons, inhabitants, nearly all of them, of the said island, for both the former and the latter had had and still had a common and general interest in the pending suit as a matter of the concern of all.\u00a0 The judge, therefore, by an order\u00a0 of February 13 of the same year, directed that \"under the denomination of 'and other inhabitants of the Island of San Miguel, Tabaco, Albay, P. I.,' the persons who had and have an interest in the 1,300 hectares of land in question, situated on the said island, shall be included as defendants.\"<br\/><br\/>The trial being had in all its proceedings, with the attendance of the Attorney-General in behalf of the Government of the United States which as a third party opposed the plaintiff's claim, and after the production of evidence by the parties, the court, on December 3, 1906, rendered judgment by finding that the land sought to be recovered belonged to the plaintiff, Villanueva, ordered the defendants to deliver to him the possession of the same, and absolved the plaintiff from the intervener's complaint, with the costs equally upon the defendants and the intervener.\u00a0 Counsel for the defendants appealed from this judgment and the appeal having been brought in second instance before this court, was affirmed by the decision of March 25, 1908.<br\/><br\/>In compliance with a writ addressed to the sheriff of the province and his deputies, proceedings were taken for the execution of the said final judgment and, among other mandates, the defendants were ordered to deliver the possession of the land in litigation to the\u00a0 plaintiff, Mariano Villanueva, and to pay the costs; and, although\u00a0 it is alleged that all those who now appear as the plaintiffs in this case were ousted from the land, the proceedings had\u00a0 in execution show that notification was served on only 8 of the 14 persons expressly sued and whose names appear in the complaints of the previous consolidated cases Nos. 29 and 33, six of whom apparently were neither notified nor warned to vacate their respective lands; but, on the other hand, the record shows that many who do not appear expressly as defendants in the said consolidated cases were so notified, and, in the new complaint afterwards filed by Miguel Berses and 318 others who claim to be injured\u2014a complaint which initiated this case, No. 943 of the court of Albay and No. 7309 of the calendar of the Supreme Court\u2014it is alleged that all the 319 plaintiffs were ousted from the land recovered by Mariano P. Villanueva, now the defendant in the present case.<br\/><br\/>On the hypothesis, then, that all the land comprising the 1,300 hectares, the subject matter of the action for recovery, was entirely released and vacated by its deforciants and placed at the disposal of Mariano P. Villanueva, the owner thereof recognized as such by final judgment of the courts, it is to be presumed that, all the occupants of the said land were ejected and expelled therefrom, not only the 14 defendants in the action for recovery, but also the 305 usurpers of the land sought to be recovered by Villanueva as the owner thereof, notwithstanding that these 305 occupants of the property were not expressly sued in the action aforementioned nor was judgment rendered against them.<br\/><br\/>So that, of the 319 persons who figure in the present case as plaintiffs and demand indemnity for losses and damages and for the value of the improvements which they each had made on their respective portions of the land in question held by them up to the date when they were ousted therefrom, only 14 of them were sued by Mariano P. Villanueva through the action for recovery brought in the previous case and the other 305 were not heard therein, notwithstanding which they were ousted and compelled to vacate their respective lands by virtue of the aforesaid judgment which ordered that all the land be restored to its recognized owner, M. P. Villanueva.<br\/><br\/>Both in the judgment appealed from and in that rendered in the previous action for recovery, it was held that, in accordance with the evidence introduced in the one case and in the other, the 14 defendants in the first one were mere deforciants and possessors in bad faith of the respective portions of the land they were occupying comprised within the property belonging to the present defendant, Villanueva. inasmuch as not only those 14 defendants, but also the rest of the occupants of\u00a0 the land recovered in the previous suit, were well aware that the whole of the land in question, comprising an area of 1,300 hectares, belonged to the then plaintiff, Mariano P. Villanueva, who, since November 1, 1890, had held title thereto by composition with the state, which title was registered on June 13, 1891, while the 14 defendants, and doubtless the rest of the occupants of the land concerned in that suit, were absolutely destitute of any title such as might in any manner legalize and justify the possession or tenancy which they had been enjoying of their respective portions of the said land.<br\/><br\/>The Civil Code prescribes as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 362. He who builds, plants, or sows in bad faith on another's land loses what he has built, planted, or sown, without right to indemnity.<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 363. The owner of the land on which anyone has built, planted, or sown in bad faith may demand the demolition of the work or the removal of the planting or sowing and the restoring of everything to its original condition at the expense of the person who built, planted, or sowed.\"<br\/><br\/>\"Art. 433. Any person who is not aware that there is in his title or in the manner of acquiring it any flaw invalidating the\u00a0 same shall be considered a possessor in good faith.<br\/><br\/>\"Possessors aware thereof are considered possessors in bad faith.\"<\/blockquote>If the plaintiffs had really been in possession of the land before the issuance of the title to the defendant, Villanueva, in November, 1890, they would, through the means of the notices and publications made in the place where the land is situated and of its measurement and survey, have had an opportunity to object during the course of the proceedings and present adverse claims in defense of their rights and interests.<br\/><br\/>The claim being restricted to improvements and to losses and damages occasioned subsequent to the grant to the defendant of the adjustment title proving his ownership of the said land, and after the termination of the administrative proceedings (in which it is presumed all the legal formalities were complied with and that the land, the composition of which was sought, was uncultivated royal land), and upon the issuance of the proper title to Mariano P. Villanueva, in November, 1890, he became the sole proprietor and tenant as owner of such land granted by the state through adjustment, inasmuch as the Government, in granting the ownership title to the said land, did so with the understanding that the latter was unappropriated and not in the legal possession of anyone.<br\/><br\/>Aside from the foregoing, there arises the question brought up by the defendant and decided affirmatively in the judgment appealed from, to wit, whether the claim for the payment of the improvements and the indemnity for losses and damages should have been the subject of a counterclaim and have been made during the previous suit brought for the recovery of the land on which such improvements were effected and the losses and damages were suffered by the plaintiffs, as by them alleged.<br\/><br\/>The first part of section 97 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"<i>Effect of omission to set up counterclaim<\/i>.\u2014If the right out of which the counterclaim arises exists at the time of the commencement of the action and arises out of the transaction set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiff's claim, or is necessarily connected with the subject of the action, neither the defendant nor his assignee can afterwards maintain an action against the plaintiff therefor, if the defendant omits to set up a counterclaim for the same.\"<\/blockquote>In view of the terms and sense of the provisions just above quoted, it is undeniable and to be understood of course that the right of action and other rights alleged by the plaintiffs in this\u00a0 suit existed on the date\u00a0 when Villanueva, now the defendant, filed his complaint for the recovery of the land on\u00a0 which the plaintiffs allege they made the improvements, the value of which they claim, and suffered the losses and damages occasioned them; for, since the action brought by Villanueva had for its object the recovery of the land wrongfully detained by the plaintiffs, on the ground that he was the owner and proprietor thereof, and the 14 plaintiffs, the defendants in the previous suit, were unable to allege or present any title whatever showing that they had a better right of possession such as might outweigh and invalidate the composition title obtained by Villanueva for the said land, and, furthermore, because of the statements and averments made by the latter in his complaint for recovery, the defendants in that action, plaintiffs herein, ought to have understood from the beginning1 that they would very likely be defeated in the suit, as occurred, and for this reason they should have set up a counterclaim in that case for the value of the improvements and the amount of the losses and damages demanded herein, inasmuch as such improvements and indemnity were necessarily connected with the suit for the restitution or recovery of the land claimed to have been improved, and with the results of the execution of the judgment awarding that recovery.<br\/><br\/>The 14 plaintiffs, the defendants in that previous suit, did not duly present the proper counterclaim, notwithstanding that, in answering the complaint in the action for recovery, they alleged that the value of the lands they possessed, owing to the improvements made by them thereon by plowing and cultivation, amounted to P300,000.\u00a0 Pursuant to the specific provisions of the section aforecited, this omission on the part of the plaintiffs bars them from presenting any claim whatever against the defendant for improvements.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the 305 persons, also plaintiffs in this case and who were not expressly sued in the previous one, Nos. 29 and 33 consolidated, relative to the recovery of the land owned by the herein defendant, Mariano P. Villanueva, and in which judgment has already been rendered and executed, although they were in the same condition of possessors in bad faith as the other 14 plaintiffs who were the sole defendants in that previous suit, yet, since these 305 deforciants of the land in litigation were not cited or summoned to appear in the said suit, the final judgment rendered therein could produce no legal effect whatever on them nor affect those who were not in due manner actually cited or summoned to appear in that suit prosecuted through the action for recovery brought by the owner of the land, Mariano P. Villanueva, nor were they true parties defendant therein; therefore, in executing the judgment of recovery awarded against those 305 persons who legally were not parties defeated at suit, they were wrongly divested of the possession of their respective portions of land without due process of law, inasmuch as the case prosecuted against the 14 defendants and the judgment rendered therein awarding the recovery was not had against the said 305 persons, herein plaintiffs, who notwithstanding were ousted\u00a0 from and unlawfully divested of the property which they respectively held, even though as usurpers, without proper trial and judgment and without observance of the legal formalities established by the procedural law.<br\/><br\/>Section 114 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which treats of parties to actions, prescribes as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"*\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 all persons having an interest in the subject of the action and in obtaining the relief demanded shall be joined as plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>\"Any person should be made a defendant who has or claims an interest in the controversy or the subject matter thereof adverse to the plaintiff, or who is a necessary party to a complete determination or settlement of the questions involved therein.<br\/><br\/>\"If any person having an\u00a0 interest in the subject of the action, and in obtaining the relief demanded refuses to join as plaintiff with those having a like interest, he may be made a defendant, the fact, of his interest and refusal to join being stated in the complaint.\"<\/blockquote>In the document presented in evidence and found on page 95 of the first set of records in Case No. 29 of the court of Albay, the names of Miguel Berses, Saturnino Bon, Leon Buison, Basilio Buela, Alejandro Bognalos, Idelfonso Buera, Vicente Bolga, Jacinto Brotas, Alberto Beniste, Tomas Berlon, Alejandro Brusola, Fabian Bonagua, Mariano Bonagua, and Agustin Bonagua, appear as the sole defendants in that suit and it was alleged therein by their counsel that both they and others not mentioned in the record had a common and general interest in the case, and that it was impossible for them all to appear at the\u00a0 trial.\u00a0 He therefore requested the court to rule that the defendants named in the complaint represented not only themselves, but also the rest of the parties interested in the suit, under the denomination of \"inhabitants of the Island of San Miguel,\" in accordance with the provisions of section 118 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding that the said defendants' counsel did not state that all the inhabitants of the Island of San Miguel held in common and <i>pro indiviso<\/i> all or a part of the land claimed by its owner, Villanueva, the court, by an order of February 13, granted the motion and directed that such persons as had and might have an interest in the 1,300 hectares in question should be included in the case under the denomination of \"and other inhabitants of the Island of San Miguel, Tabaco, Albay,\" and this, despite the fact that it was to be presumed that each one of the 319 occupants of the property held separately his respective portion of land independently of the rest, so that they did not have a common interest, but a separate and distinct one with respect to each parcel of land held.<br\/><br\/>This ruling is undoubedly grounded on the provisions of the section aforecited, No. 118 of the Code of Civil Procedure, invoked by counsel for the said 14 defendants in that terminated suit; but this court does not agree nor can it accept the judicial criterion which determined\u00a0 the ruling above mentioned, since the provisions of the law refer to cases where a considerable number of persons have a common and general interest in a specific thing and in the trial relating thereto it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.\u00a0 The provisions of section 118 above mentioned are not applicable to a case where each of the persons who should be summoned as defendants in an action brought by a single plaintiff has only a special or particular interest in a specific thing completely different from another thing in which another of the defendants has a like interest, although each of them has the same or analogous reasons and is able to allege the same grounds to impugn the complaint wherein claim is made for the restitution or recovery of all the parts of a property.<br\/><br\/>Each one of the 319 defendants in the said action, No. 29, prosecuted by Mariano P. Villanueva, was in possession of a parcel or portion of the land comprised within the metes and bounds of the 1,300 hectares of land acquired by the plaintiff, Villanueva, under a composition title with the state.\u00a0 Each one of them, according to the evidence taken in that suit, was a usurper of, or mere trespasser on, the respective portion of land held by him, and inasmuch as none could\u00a0 prove the just title under which he claimed and all of them were in possession with the purpose of appropriating to themselves the respective portions of land occupied by them individually, consequently they all had the same status with respect to the action for recovery brought by the sole owner of the land.\u00a0 But it is no less true that each one of the said 319 defendants held, on the date of the complaint for recovery, a parcel or portion of land completely distinct from the parcel or portion held respectively by each of the 318 other defendants, and each of them, at the commencement of the action, might have alleged a right or special ground which the others could not plead or did not have.\u00a0 The 14 persons who were summoned to appear at court and were defeated in the suit relative to the possession of their respective portions of land might have been able to allege grounds and reasons completely distinct from those which might have been alleged by the other 305 parties who were not summoned and were afterwards, as a result of the final judgment rendered against the sole 14 defendants, ousted from the respective portions of the land they were holding.\u00a0 Some of them might have alleged ordinary or extraordinary prescription, while others perhaps could have shown no right except such as derives from mere possession without title whatsoever.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, the said 319 persons, the plaintiffs in this case, were not coheirs or coowners of anything held in common among them, nor did they possess jointly and <i>pro indiviso<\/i> the 1,300 hectares of land of the Island of San Miguel, but each one of them separately held his respective portion of land and\u00a0 each one was sued for the restitution of what he was wrongfully withholding from its rightful owner, according to the demand made by the latter solely against 14 of them.\u00a0 Each one, in a different manner, might have alleged and proved his respective right in the distinct portion occupied by him.\u00a0 Therefore it may not be averred that they all had an identical interest and based their possession on precisely the same grounds, for each one might have had distinct interests and rights from those of the rest and each one of the 305 persons who were not parties to the suit might perhaps have alleged and shown better proof than that adduced by the 14 defendants who were defeated in that action concerning the respective portion of land which they each occupied.<br\/><br\/>Considering, then, that the aforecited provisions of section 118 of the Code of Civil Procedure are not applicable to the present case, as they relate to a common and general interest in single specific things and not to complex and distinct ones, and that, for the reasons aforestated, it was improper to have considered as defendants the 305 persons who were not summoned and did not intervene as parties in the said case No. 29, the final judgment therein rendered could not legally have been executed against the said 305, and therefore, by their being expelled from the tenancy of their respective lands by virtue of such judgment which in no wise could affect them, they were unlawfully despoiled of their possession.\u00a0 Consequently, though they are not entitled to lay any claim for improvements made without good faith on the respective parcels of land they occupied, they have, however, an incontestable right to indemnity for the damages occasioned them as a result of the violent dispossession to which they were subjected in being ousted without previous trial from the respective portions of land they were occupying.<br\/><br\/>The record does not show, however, the amount and importance of the damages suffered by each of the said 305 persons, for by the evidence adduced in this case it has neither been proven nor shown what kind of\u00a0 damages were occasioned to them by the execution of the said judgment ordering the restitution of the land sought to be recovered, nor what was the amount of such damages with respect to each one of the interested parties.\u00a0 It is therefore expedient for the purpose of justice that a rehearing be had and new evidence taken therein conducive to prove the said two points in relation to each one of the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the counterclaim made by the defendant and disallowed in the judgment appealed from, since the latter entered no exception to such absolutory finding of the trial court, no cognizance thereof can be taken by us.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from are deemed to have been refuted, it is proper to affirm the said judgment, as we do hereby, with respect to the aforenamed 14 defendants concerned in the said case, Nos. 29 and 33 consolidated, each of whom shall pay one of the 319 parts into which the costs of both instances are considered to be divided; and the said judgment is reversed as regards the other 305 plaintiffs, whose names appear in the complaint.\u00a0 The record shall be remanded to the court of its origin, accompanied by a certified copy of this decision, in order that it may proceed to reopen the case with respect to the aforesaid 305 plaintiffs who were not parties defendant in the previous one,\u00a0 No. 29, and, after amendment of the complaint with respect to the damages that may have been occasioned by the execution of the judgment of recovery in so far as they were thereby affected, to take evidence relevant to the points above specified, and finally to render such judgment as the law and the evidence require.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

ANDRES HERRERA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The defendant and appellant was convicted in the court below, of the robbery of P60 which it was alleged he snatched from the hands of a Chinaman named Sityar on the morning of January 23, 1913.<br\/><br\/>The complaining witness Sityar testified\u00a0 that on the morning in question he, in company with another Chinaman named Diak, left the town of Balanga and went to the town of Pilar for the purpose of buying empty bottles, old brass, and the like; that while standing on the street in Pilar, at the foot of the stairs of a house the owner of which had gone inside to collect some bottles, he had in his hand his pocketbook containing twelve 5-peso bills, preparatory to his anticipated purchase; that at that moment the accused, in company\u00a0 with a short-haired Chinaman dressed like an American, approached him and snatched from his hand the pocketbook together with its contents; that immediately thereafter they ran away and together entered a carromata which was standing a little distance down the street and drove rapidly in the direction of Balanga.<br\/><br\/>The other Chinaman, his companion Diak, substantially corroborated his story, and the testimony of these two witnesses is the only evidence in the record bearing directly upon the commission of the alleged robbery.<br\/><br\/>The accused, testifying in his own behalf, admitted that on the morning of\u00a0 January 23, 1913, he had gone from the town of Balanga to the town of Pilar in company with a short-haired Chinaman\u00a0 dressed like an American, but he swore that he did not snatch the money from the hands of the complaining witness as alleged in the information, and that the truth of the matter was that he, together with his Chinese companion and some other Filipinos had taken part in a game of cards in the house of a woman named Inocencia Garcia, and that the complaining witness\u00a0 and his companion also took part in the game, in the course of which they lost some P50 or F60 to his companion, the short-haired Chinaman.<br\/><br\/>Several witnesses were called for the defense, who corroborated the statement of the accused as to the game in the house of Inocencia Garcia and as to the participation therein of the complaining witness and his companion.\u00a0 Some of these witnesses entered into details as to the manner in which the complaining witness lost his money.\u00a0 They said that the party was engaged in playing monte; that the short-haired Chinaman dressed in American clothes dealt the game; that while the game was in progress the dealer arose from the table, and excusing himself left the room for a few moments; that during his absence the complaining witness turned over the cards which were about to be dealt, and upon the return of the dealer bet P50 on the next play; that notwithstanding the apparent certainty of the bet he lost his money, the card upon which he had placed his money not turning up as he had expected.<br\/><br\/>The theory of the defense is, of course, that the two Chinamen who lost their money in the game of monte had falsely charged the accused,\u00a0 who was present at the game in company with the dexterous dealer, with the crime of robbery in the manner and form set out in the information, either by way of vengeance or in the hope of recouping their losses by way of civil indemnity upon the conviction of the accused of the offense with which they charged him.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge accepted as true the story told by the complaining witness and his companion, and refused to believe the testimony of the witnesses for the defense, and we would be strongly inclined to accept the findings of the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses testify, but for the fact that he manifestly overlooked certain contradictions and inconsistent statements which appear in the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, and failed to give due weight to the inherent improbability of the story of the commission of the crime as related by the witnesses for the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge says in his findings:\u00a0 \"The testimony of the driver of the carromata used by the defendant on the day of the occurrence corroborates the statements of the two Chinese, Sityar and Diak, and the court therefore accepts it as the truthful statement of the occurrence.\"<br\/><br\/>Examining the testimony of this cochero we find that he stated that on the morning of the day in question he brought the accused together with the\u00a0 short-haired Chinaman dressed in American clothes (whose identity is not disclosed in the record, but to whom reference has already been made several times), from the town of Balanga to the town of Pilar; that they left him standing at a corner of the street; that when the short-haired Chinaman returned\u00a0 to the vehicle he had with him another Filipino, not the accused, and that these two, having gotten into his carromata, drove down the street some little distance to another corner, where they picked up the accused, and that thereafter the whole party returned to Pilar.\u00a0 It will be seen that the evidence of this cochero corroborates the testimony of the complaining witnesses only in so far as that testimony is not denied by the accused himself, that is to say, as to the fact that the accused was in the town of Pilar on the morning in question, together with the short-haired Chinaman dressed as an American; and that so far from corroborating the testimony of the complaining witnesses as to the commission of the crime charged, it is in direct contradiction to the statements of the complaining witnesses who testified that the accused, together with the\u00a0 short-haired Chinaman, ran away after snatching the pocketbook, and together got into the carromata and drove away.<br\/><br\/>The complaining witness and his companion on cross-examination said that when the accused made away with the money they made no outcry and\u00a0 were unable to catch lip with him or his companion because they were elderly men and could not run fast enough.\u00a0 As counsel for appellant well says, it would seem to be inherently improbable that two Chinamen would permit F60 to be snatched from the hands of one of them and carried away in broad daylight on the street of a village with houses near by without raising any outcry or attempting to secure the assistance of the people in the neighborhood in capturing the thieves.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for appellant point to a number of other contradictions and inconsistencies in the statements of the principal witnesses for the prosecution, but we do not think it necessary to review them in detail.\u00a0 Suffice it to say that taken in connection with what has already been said with regard to their testimony, they are sufficient to raise in our minds a reasonable doubt as to the truth of the story told by the principal witnesses for the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge appears to have given no credence whatever to the testimony of the witnesses called for the defense, and based his action in this regard upon the ground that in his opinion \"self-confessed gamblers who apparently thought it even right to defraud and cheat at cards\" are not to be greatly relied upon as witnesses.\u00a0 We are inclined to think that the trial judge was hardly justified in wholly disregarding the testimony of these witnesses on the ground stated by him.\u00a0 It would be going far to say that the testimony of any man who admits that he ever played a game of cards for money is unworthy of credence on that ground alone, and the witnesses in this\u00a0 case who described what occurred at the game in regard to which they testified, and who told how the complaining witness and his companion lost their money, merely related the incident as they saw it and evidently had no part in the trick by which the Chinamen who sought to take an unfair advantage of the dealer of the game were themselves brought to grief.\u00a0 To our minds the story told by the witnesses for the defense bears all the earmarks of truth, and in the light of their testimony we are strongly inclined to believe that the charge set forth in the information has no other basis than the desire of the Chinamen who lost their money at the game of monte to revenge themselves upon the accused and if possible to recoup their losses from him.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below convicting and sentencing the defendant should be and is hereby reversed, with the costs in both instances <i>de oficio<\/i>, and the defendant and appellant is acquitted of\u00a0 the offense with which he was charged,<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

JOSE MALLARI AND VICENTE CUESON, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\"> These defendants were charged with the crime of <i>lesiones menos graves<\/i> and found guilty by the judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Cagayan.\u00a0 Jose Mallari was sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of three months of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> and Vicente Cueson was sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of one month of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>, and each to pay one-half the costs. From that sentence both of the defendants appealed.<br\/><br\/>During the pendency of the appeal the defendant Vicente Cueson withdrew his appeal (see Record), and the sentence of the lower court as to him became final.<br\/><br\/>An examination of the evidence shows clearly that the defendant Jose Mallari, on the evening of the 29th of August, 1910, in the municipality of Aparri, Province of Cagayan, did voluntarily, illegally, and criminally with a stick or club beat and wound one Ignacio Alvarado, causing several slight wounds upon his body.\u00a0 The evidence tends to show that Ignacio Alvarado was incapacitated from pursuing his regular avocations for a few days. Alvarado testified that he was incapacitated for a period of ten days.<br\/><br\/>Mr. C. F. Brantigan, a sanitary inspector of the municipality of Aparri, testified that Alvarado was probably incapacitated from pursuing his ordinary avocations for a period of from seven to nine days.\u00a0 There is no positive proof that Alvarado was incapacitated from pursuing his ordinary avocations for a longer period than seven to nine days.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which shows that his injuries were at all serious. We are inclined to give the defendant the benefit of the doubt and find from the evidence that Alvarado was not incapacitated from pursuing his ordinary avocations for a period longer than seven days, and therefore that the defendant should be punished in accordance with the provisions of article 587 of the Penal Code. (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Lazada, 9 Phil. Rep., 509.)<br\/><br\/>The Attorney-General recommends that the defendants should be required to indemnify the offended party in the sum of P140, that being the amount which Alvarado claims he expended in being cured from the effects of the wounds inflicted upon him.\u00a0 Upon an examination of the evidence relating to this particular question, we find that Alvarado did testify that he expended the sum of P140, but the evidence does not show that this amount was expended in effecting a cure of his injuries.\u00a0 We are, therefore, disinclined to make any allowance whatever for the expenditure alleged to have been made by Alvarado.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff claims that the sentence of the lower court was void because the Court of First Instance did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter; that it was a cause falling within the original jurisdiction of a justice of the peace. In order to determine the jurisdiction of the court in criminal causes, the complaint must be examined for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the facts set out therein and the punishment provided for by law for such acts fall within the jurisdiction of the court in which the complaint is presented.\u00a0 If the facts set out in the complaint are sufficient to show that the court in which the complaint is presented has jurisdiction, then it is sufficient to hold that that court has jurisdiction.\u00a0 The mere fact that after the trial and after the court has heard the evidence, it is found that a lesser crime has been committed than that described in the complaint, the court cannot then dismiss the case because the action should have been brought in the court of a justice of the peace or in a lower court. To illustrate: A complaint is presented charging the defendant with the crime of attempted murder.\u00a0 After the trial the court finds that the crime which had actually been committed was nothing more or. less than assault and battery.\u00a0 In such a case the court taking jurisdiction over the crime described in the complaint retains jurisdiction for the purpose of imposing the penalty provided for by law for the crime proved to have been committed. In other words, the court's jurisdiction in the first instance is determined by the facts alleged in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>After a careful consideration of the facts, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the lower court should be reversed, and that the defendant should be sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of thirty days of <i>arresto menor<\/i>, and to pay one-half the costs.

and that when the fire in No. 30 was about put out, fire broke out in No. 26.\u00a0 Pedro Noel, another municipal policeman and also a witness for the defense, testified that he arrived at what he thought was about 3 o'clock.\u00a0 He entered No. 26, warning a Chinaman (whom he identified as the appellant Go Jancho) who was in there gathering up papers that he should leave, and then, at the Chinaman's request, went upstairs with him to get his trunk, which they carried as far as the stairway and then abandoned it and went downstairs and left the house.\u00a0 When he left the trastienda he saw no signs of fire.\u00a0 He testified that he then assisted with the hose at the fire in No. 30 and was employed when the Constabulary arrived.<br\/><br\/>Lim Bian Chong, who was a guest of the appellants on the night of the fire, testified that upon the alarm being given, he became scared and started downstairs immediately.\u00a0 Everyone went downstairs ahead of him except the woman Antipas, who followed\u00a0 him.\u00a0 Upon leaving the house he went to a plaza a short distance away, and found\u00a0 all the accused there.\u00a0 The woman Antipas\u00a0 testified that her husband's brother awakened her.\u00a0 She seized a picture and immediately ran downstairs and went to the plaza.\u00a0 As she passed through the trastienda she saw the appellants gathering up books.\u00a0 She returned to the house the second time to get her trunk.\u00a0 She saw no more Chinamen as she left the house the second time.\u00a0 She denied that in her sworn declaration in the preliminary investigation she had stated that when she left the house the second time\u00a0 the two appellants were still there.\u00a0 Go Jancho testified that he went downstairs immediately upon ascertaining that there was a fire, opened the safe, and took out important papers.\u00a0 These he put in a\u00a0 sack with the aid of Go Foo Suy and Go Cho Jim, and then ordered them to open the door.\u00a0 Go Cho Jim carried the sack out of the door.\u00a0 Witness remained looking for his certificate and some receipts.\u00a0 A little later a policeman entered.\u00a0 He and the policeman then went upstairs to get the trunk, which was\u00a0 abandoned at the head of the stairway.\u00a0 He left the house immediately, carrying nothing with him.\u00a0 All of his coaccused were outside of the house then, but he saw Lim Bian Chong near the door.\u00a0 He went to the plaza and there found Go Foo Suy, Go Cho Jim, and Go Juat Chiong.\u00a0 He ordered the latter to return and get his (Jancho's) trunk, but Go Juat Chiong came back in a little while saying that the policemen would not let him enter the house.<br\/><br\/>Go Juat Chiong testified that he was sleeping downstairs; that he was awakened by the alarm of fire and saw the appellants come downstairs and enter the office.\u00a0 He himself went directly upstairs to get his trunk.\u00a0 He was still in the house when Lim Bian Chong and Go Quip came downstairs.\u00a0 Upon coming downstairs he did not see Go Cho Jim, Go Foo Suy or Go Jancho in the\u00a0 trastienda.\u00a0 He did not wish to say that he was the last to leave the house, but simply that he did not notice anyone when he came downstairs.\u00a0 He left the house carrying his belongings and went to the plaza, where he saw the others Go Jancho ordered him to return to get a trunk, but upon reaching the house the policemen refused to allow him to enter.\u00a0 He saw persons inside the house then.<br\/><br\/>Go Cho Jim testified that he was sleeping in the lower part of the house near the stairway when he heard some one upstairs give the alarm.\u00a0 He got up and after he had dressed himself Go Jancho ordered him to open the door so that he could leave with the money and books.\u00a0 When he opened the door he saw no one.\u00a0 As he left with the money he saw some\u00a0 policemen outside.\u00a0 There remained in the tienda Go Foo Suy, Go Jancho, and Go Juat Chiong.\u00a0 He did not go upstairs or return to the house after he left it.<br\/><br\/>It will be noted that while there is some disagreement between the inmates of the house as to the order in which they left it, none of them claim to have spent more than a few minutes in the house.\u00a0 All, further, state positively that there was no fire in the house when they left.\u00a0 According to this testimony, then, they must have been standing on the plaza a considerable time before No. 26 caught fire.<br\/><br\/>Captain Hemmett of the Constabulary, whose attention was attracted to the fire in the trastienda of No. 26 immediately upon his arrival, and who went directly to that fire, stated that on entering the trastienda he saw a policeman with four or five Chinamen who had just come out of the trastienda.<br\/><br\/>Pablo Navarro, the municipal policeman who on arriving went directly to the fire in No. 26, testified that he went to the door\u00a0 of the trastienda, and upon entering saw a Chinaman in the doorway and three others seated at a table, one of whom was writing and identified them as being, respectively, Go Juat Chiong and Go Jancho, Go Foo Suy and Go Cho Jim; that when they saw him they began to run; that he asked them why they did so as there was a fire in the house; that he told the chief of police\u00a0 about this upon the latter's arrival shortly afterwards; and that the chief ordered him to go and arrest the Chinamen.\u00a0 He found and arrested two of the Chinamen on the plaza.<br\/><br\/>Enrique Tabada testified that he saw Go Juat Chiong and Go Cho Jim in the house upon entering.\u00a0 A curtain which was on fire he tore loose and threw out of the house.\u00a0 Besides the Chinamen that he saw, he heard the voices of others but could not say whether they were outside or inside the tienda.\u00a0 The policeman Bototo testified for the defense and stated that upon arriving at the trastienda a Chinaman came up, and that acting under instructions from the policeman Tabada he arrested the Chinaman and refused to let him enter.\u00a0 The sworn declaration of the chief of police, made on February 26, contains the following statement:<br\/><blockquote>\"The accused Go Cho Jim is the one who was arrested by me at the moment of coming out of the door and at the time when the rear end of the bodega was broken open by order of the president for the purpose of putting out the fire which had been discovered within.\"<\/blockquote>The conflict between the statements of these witnesses and the declarations of the inmates of the house is most evident.\u00a0 According to these witnesses, a number of Chinamen were found in or near the house after the trastienda had caught fire, all of them being actually identified as the accused persons by one or more of the witnesses; while the accused declare positively that they had left the building very shortly after the alarm of fire in No. 30 was given and had gone directly to the plaza, which would make them standing there a considerable time before the fire in No. 26 broke out.\u00a0 In this connection Go Jancho testified that he did not return to the store after leaving it; that he was arrested on the plaza, and that it was not until he arrived at the police station that he learned that a fire had occurred in No. 26.\u00a0 Presumably, therefore, where he was standing on the plaza, it was impossible to observe the fire.\u00a0 It does not seem probable that the owner of a stock of goods, if prompted by good motives, would thus desert his property when there was so little danger of personal injury.\u00a0 Even if the defendants' statements that they remained on the plaza and did not go near the fire were accepted as true, only an unfavorable inference could be drawn from such conduct.<br\/><br\/>Gil de la Cruz, an employee of the city garbage system, testified that while waiting at No. 26, between 1 and 2 o'clock on the morning of the fire, for the cars to come and carry away the pails he had collected, he saw Go Jancho coming into the passageway between Nos. 30 and 26 from the Street Norte America, and go as far as the kitchen of No. 30 and then return to the street again.\u00a0 Jancho was fully dressed with the exception of a hat.\u00a0 Jancho declared that after going to bed that evening about 11 or 12 o'clock he did not get up until the alarm of fire \"awakened\u00a0 him.<br\/><br\/>Three fires were discovered in No. 26 almost simultaneously.\u00a0 One was in the bodega, where some rolls of sauale lying on the floor were afire.\u00a0 This fire was practically in the center of the room.\u00a0 One was in the trastienda where bolts of cloth stored on impromptu shelves made of boxes piled one above the other were afire.\u00a0 The bed in the living quarters of the woman Antipas also caught fire.<br\/><br\/>As to the fire in the room of the woman Antipas, counsel for the defense say in part:\u00a0 \"This,\" referring to the testimony of the chief of police, \"is the only evidence as to how and when the hole was burnt in the bottom of the bed.\"<br\/><br\/>Again they say:\u00a0 \"Several witnesses for the prosecution were allowed to give hearsay evidence to the effect that the bed was burnt in the room of the woman, but nobody testified that they saw it burning or that they extinguished the fire.\u00a0 As has been noted, the fiscal asked a few adroit questions relating to the bed, and then promptly changed his questions to other topics.\u00a0 This is so noticeable that there is only one deduction to be\u00a0 drawn from it, namely, that nothing definite was known about the fire in that room and that the testimony relating to it is mere conjecture.\"<br\/><br\/>Aldanese, the chief of police, identified Exhibit G as a photograph of the burnt bed, and pointed out the bed standing at the window as shown in Exhibit B.\u00a0 He also testified that the bed was burned at the same time the other fires in No. 26 occurred.<br\/><br\/>The witness Bryan testified that when he entered the trastienda there was a fire on the second floor and that he could hear it burning.\u00a0 He stated that he did not go upstairs.\u00a0 Captain Lucas testified that he did not go Upstairs.\u00a0 The policeman Tabada testified as fallows:<br\/><blockquote>\"When we saw fire in the rear of this house (No\u00a0 26) we called to the firemen to put it out, and when the fire which was burning in the street was put out, we saw also\u00a0 that there was a fire in the lower part of the same house.\u00a0 As it was difficult to put out the fire which was in the lower part of the house, we went to the bodega underneath the part where the fire had occurred, and tore off some pieces of zinc\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>The first question put to him on cross-examination was:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q, So that the first\u00a0 fire you\u00a0 saw in house No. 26 was upstairs?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Afterwards you saw that there was also a fire in the place below the fire, where the store was?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.\"<\/blockquote>Pedro Noel, another municipal policeman, who testified for the defense, stated that the three fires in No. 26 were burning at the same time; that when he saw the fire in the window upstairs, he said to the man who had charge of the house, \"Let us throw water on this fire.\"\u00a0 In another place he says that after throwing\" water on the bed they went back to No. 30 and heard one Fructuoso Ramos crying, \"Here is another fire,\" and on going back began to put out the fire in the bodega.\u00a0 Aside from this evidence of the witnesses, an empty bottle which had contained petroleum and a small kerosene lamp, also empty, were found underneath the bed.\u00a0 The photograph of the bed was also admitted as evidence and shows that only the matting which formed its bottom and the furnishings were burned.\u00a0 This evidence establishes the fact that there was a fire upstairs at the same time the other fires in No. 26 were burning.\u00a0 We confess our inability to perceive any ulterior motive on the part of the prosecution in neglecting to make a more extended investigation of this fire.\u00a0 Counsel for the defense were equally at liberty to sift this matter to the bottom on cross-examination of the witnesses for the prosecution who testified in regard to this fire, and in the direct examination of their own witness,\u00a0 Pedro Noel.\u00a0 It certainly cannot\u00a0 be denied that this bed was afire at or nearly at the same time as the other two fires in No. 26, and that it was put out.\u00a0 These are the important facts, and from the testimony of the witnesses Tabada and Noel, it would appear that the hose was simply directed at the window near which the bed was standing and that the fire was easily extinguished in this manner.\u00a0 The chief of police testified that there was no wind blowing at the time\u00a0 of the fire.\u00a0 Photographs submitted by the prosecution show\u00a0 two nipa shacks located on the opposite side of No. 30 within 3 or 4 meters, which were not damaged.\u00a0 The witness Cuico, who lived in one of these shacks, stated that it was about 3\u00bc meters from No. 30 and that it did not suffer the slighest damage from the fire.\u00a0 The only openings in the side of No, 26 nearest No. 30 were two windows.\u00a0 From the record it appears that at least one of these windows opened into the trastienda and that it was closed up to the time the fire was discovered in this room.\u00a0 Pieces of paper in this window were not touched by the fire.\u00a0 There were two windows in the upper floor opening at the rear, the bed standing near the one farthest from No. 30.\u00a0 The window\u00a0 nearest No. 30 was closed when the photograph (Exhibit B) was taken, while the other was open, and the bed in question can be seen standing near it.\u00a0 The record does not show whether this window was open or closed when the fire occurred, but assuming that it was open, sparks from No. 30 would have had to cross the passageway of 9\u00bd meters to No. 26, as well as the additional space between the nearest wall\u00a0 of No. 26 and the window near the other side, and in so doing must necessarily have described an arc, as the end\u00a0 walls of both houses were practically on a line.\u00a0 As noted above, the fire in No. 30 had no inclination to spread and houses of highly inflammable material much nearer than the bed in question, and which sparks could have reached without impediment of any kind, were not touched by the\u00a0 fire.\u00a0 The shed or lean-to attached to No. 30 and directly between that house and No. 30 was left intact.\u00a0 It seems highly improbable that sparks from No. 30 could have entered the window and set fire to the bed.\u00a0 Nor does this explanation dispose of the evidence of incendiarism in the way of empty kerosene receptacles found in the room where the bed was.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the appellants also contend that the fire in the trastienda caught from the fire in the bodega by passing through the partition between the two rooms.\u00a0 All the evidence of record appears to negative this proposition.\u00a0 The witness Bryan, it is true, says that the fire in the trastienda appeared to be entering through a wall, and in another place says that the flames came from\u00a0 behind the wall from the burning sauale in the bodega, but a little later in his testimony he says that there was a fire in the trastienda at the same time as the fire in the bodega was burning, and that although they took down many bolts of cloth looking for a possible connection between the two fires, they could not find any signs of the flames passing from one room to another, either above or on the sides of the room.\u00a0 Captain Hemmett testified that he went to the house on the following day and saw no signs of fire on the partition between the two rooms.\u00a0 Captain Lucas said it was possible that the fire in the trastienda could have caught from the fire in the bodega, but that the fire in\u00a0 the bodega was more to the left.\u00a0 Several of the witnesses stated that only the outer edges of the bolts of cloth were\u00a0 burned.\u00a0 It would seem that if there was as a matter of fact any connection between the two fires, the bolts of cloth would have caught fire on the ends nearest the partition.\u00a0 But it appears that the fire in the bodega (or, for that matter, either of the other two fires in No. 26 did not damage the building in the slightest.\u00a0 The fire in the bodega could not, therefore, have assumed large proportions, and its insignificance is also an indication of the improbability of its igniting a fire in another room.\u00a0 The\u00a0 court, after an ocular inspection of the premises, also decided that the fire in the bodega could not have started the fire in the trastienda.\u00a0 That, the burning bolts of cloth in the trastienda were covered with petroleum is indisputably established by the testimony of competent witnesses.\u00a0 In his deposition taken the day after the fire, the appellant Go Jancho is recorded as saying that he could not explain why this cloth was covered with petroleum, but the fact was, nevertheless, that there was petroleum on it.\u00a0 In the court below he denied making this statement, saying that what he did say was that he did not know whether petroleum or water had been poured on it.\u00a0 As the appellant must have had sufficient sagacity to know that water-soaked cloth will not burn, the insincerity of this statement is apparent.\u00a0 Three bottles were found under the table and one was found behind the door in the trastienda, all of which had contained petroleum.<br\/><br\/>As to the fire in the bodega, it is practically conceded by the defense that it was of incendiary origin.\u00a0 The only thing that was burning in this room was some sauale lying on the floor.\u00a0 The witness Rosello testified that he found two bottles in the bodega near the burning sauale, together with a broken match box.\u00a0 He stated that he saw signs of petroleum on the sauale.\u00a0 The policeman Bototo, a witness for the defense, testified that he found a bottle in the bodega which had contained petroleum.\u00a0 Witness Bryan\u00a0 testified that the burning sauale was taken out of the bodega and that as it was unrolled it would burst into flame.\u00a0 But it is urged by the defense that some unknown person found access to the bodega through its door and deliberately started the fire.\u00a0 It is strongly insisted that the evidence of record not only shows that the door to the bodega was not locked, but that those who came to put out the fire found the door open.\u00a0 Upon this point the witness Cuico testified that while he was assisting at the fire in No. 30 the president told him to look around, and on so doing he saw smoke issuing from the bodega of No. 26.\u00a0 He immediately started for the bodega, followed by the president and two policemen.\u00a0 On arriving there the president ordered that an opening be made in the wall of the bodega.\u00a0 Cuico remembered there was a door on the other side of the bodega and ran to open it.\u00a0 While he was trying to push the door open, he heard something moving in the bodega.\u00a0 He could not say whether it was an animal or a person.\u00a0 He knocked on the door and called out, \"Open, open\" several times, but receiving no response he left the door and went to the rear where they were making an opening in the wall by tearing off some pieces of iron.\u00a0 Again, he says that as they had no tools with which to make an opening in the bodega he went to get some, and upon <i>their<\/i> return they began to force the door open and finally it yielded.\u00a0 He says the hole in the wall in the rear was made first.\u00a0 After the fire he looked around the bodega as he was not certain about the noise he had heard inside and saw a hole in the bamboo matting forming the partition between the bodega and the trastienda, When the fiscal came to the house to conduct an investigation, Cuico called his attention to this hole and told him about the noise he had heard in the bodega.\u00a0 The hole shows plainly in the photograph (Exhibit F, of the prosecution).\u00a0 Although we agree that Cuico's testimony\u00a0 with regard to the door being closed and in reference to hearing\" something moving in the bodega is not corroborated by any other witness, it does not appear that he was flatly contradicted by Captain Lucas, as counsel insist.\u00a0 As stated above, when Captain Lucas arrived, both houses were on fire.\u00a0 He first entered the trastienda.\u00a0 But he was not, by his own testimony\/the first person to enter the trastienda, as stated by counsel for the appellants.\u00a0 He found a policeman and a clerk, Mr. Bryan, and one or two other persons whose names he could not remember, when he entered the trastienda.\u00a0 The fire in this place, according to Captain Lucas, had burned some time when he arrived.\u00a0 It will be noted that Captain Lucas first entered the trastienda and that he spent some little time there.\u00a0 There could have been plenty of time, then, for Cuico to find the door in question closed and to hear the noise within the bodega and to secure aid in forcing it open before Captain Lucas actually arrived at\u00a0 the bodega.\u00a0 The same is true with regard to the other witnesses who testified that they found the door open.\u00a0 Before convicting Cuico of a deliberate falsehood in testifying that he found this door closed upon the strength of the testimony of other witnesses who found it open, it\u00a0 seems necessary to show that they reached the door first or at least at the same time as Cuico.\u00a0 Neither can it be presumed that the witnesses who actually testified in regard to this door (some half dozen at the most) were the only ones who assisted in putting out the fire in the bodega.\u00a0 It must be remembered that a number of persons were assisting in this work who were not called as witnesses, and the aid rendered Cuico in forcing the door could easily have come from persons who were not called as witnesses at all.\u00a0 It seems that Cuico was familiar with the location of this door, while the others were not; and instead of obeying the president's orders to make an opening in the wall of the bodega, he went to open the said door, which accounts for his reaching it first.\u00a0 Captain Hemmett, who visited the place by daylight, testified that the only connection between the bodega and the trastienda was a hole apparently made by some person trying to escape.\u00a0 This was the hole to which Cuico referred.\u00a0 The defense were eloquently silent in regard to this hole.\u00a0 No attempt was made to show that it was impossible or even tolerably difficult to enter the trastienda by means of this hole; and it must be held proven beyond question that the hole was made on the night of the fire.\u00a0 After a very careful examination of all the testimony bearing upon the question as to whether the door to the bodega was open or not when the fire in that room was discovered, we do not find that Cuico's testimony in this respect is contradicted by anyone.<br\/><br\/>None of the accused were able to say whether the empty kerosene bottles found in various parts of the house belonged to them or not.\u00a0 There were no electric lights in the house and the occupants depended entirely upon kerosene lamps.\u00a0 The appellant, Go Jancho, admitted at the trial that bottles were used in transferring petroleum from the cans in which it was bought to the various lamps, but said that all this work was done by two muchachos, who were not in the house on the night of the fire.<br\/><br\/>We conclude (1) that certainly the fires in the bodega and in the trastienda were of incendiary origin, with a strong probability that the fire in the room upstairs was of like character; and (2) that the fire in the trastienda did not catch from the fire which was burning in the bodega, but was started separately.<br\/><br\/>No insurance was carried by the owner of either building at the time of the fire, and the Chinese carpenter who lived in No. 30 carried no insurance on his stock of goods.\u00a0 The appellants carried\u00a0 an insurance of P25,000\u00a0 on their stock of goods.\u00a0 Accompanied by the fiscal and the then counsel for the appellants, a committee of three business men, having experience in the appraisement of merchandise, went to the tienda of the accused the day following the fire and appraised the stock found there.\u00a0 The <i>highest<\/i> valuation placed upon the stock by one was P5,5OO; by another, between P6,000 and P7,000; and by\u00a0 the third, not more than P8,000.\u00a0 Nevertheless, in the court below the appellant, Go Jancho, testified that according to the books of the firm the stock of goods was worth P14,000, and the furniture in the store P1,000.\u00a0 According to his testimony, the books (which were in Chinese) further showed a profit of about P4,000 for the period September 5, 1910, to February 24, 1912.\u00a0 This profit, however, depends upon the existence of a stock of goods worth P14,000, and P1,000 worth of furniture, as well as debts owing to the firm amounting to P22,673.08.\u00a0 We cannot accept the testimony of the appellant that the books showed a profit of about P4,000 for the period in question, for the reason that the statement that according to the said books the value of the stock in the tienda was P15,000 cannot be accepted as true.\u00a0 The appraisement of the stock was made in the presence of the accused and their counsel by persons accepted by them in the court below as qualified to make it correctly.\u00a0 The highest figures submitted by any of them are scarcely more than half of what the appellants claim the stock was worth.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the fact that the committee's estimates were so far below the value of the stock as represented by their books, the accused made no effort to take a detailed inventory of the stock to substantiate the figures shown in their books and show that the committee was in error.\u00a0 Under these circumstances, we do not feel justified in accepting the figures of the appellants.\u00a0 There can be no question but that the figures of the committee were reasonably accurate.<br\/><br\/>Considerable effort has been made on this appeal to destroy the value of the testimony of various witnesses on the ground of minor differences in their testimony.\u00a0 We have carefully examined the points made by counsel.\u00a0 It will be found that most of them depend upon the establishment of the fact that the persons concerned had\u00a0 equal opportunities for observation.\u00a0 We have already pointed out this fact in the case of Cuico and Captain Lucas.\u00a0 But in any event we do not consider any of these alleged inconsistencies as reflecting upon the credibility of the witnesses.\u00a0 It is to be expected that testimony of several witnesses as to events which transpired in rapid succession, which were attended by hurry and excitement, and with the opportunity for observation so greatly hindered by the darkness of night, will disagree in the details.\u00a0 If the witnesses in the present case should agree in their testimony that all the events occurred in precisely the same order and in the same manner, that fact would itself be a suspicious circumstance.\u00a0 It must be remembered that much of the work of putting out the fire was done by persons who did not appear as witnesses at all.\u00a0 With so many assisting in putting out the fires, and the fact that it occurred in the nighttime, it is not strange that some should see what others did not see, that two witnesses observing the same incident should differ in some respects in describing it later, or that gaps\u00a0 in the evidence should appear because persons who assisted in putting out the fire were not called as witnesses.\u00a0 The fact that a united and orderly narrative of the fire in the bodega cannot be drawn from the testimony of the various witnesses who took part in extinguishing it tends rather to stamp the testimony of each as being truthful to the best of his observation.\u00a0 Furthermore, the conflicting testimony was for the lower court to weigh. This court has repeatedly refused to disturb a finding of guilt when the evidence was conflicting and there was enough before the court to warrant a conviction were evidence of the prosecution true, and conflicting evidence offered by the defense false, unless from the record it appeared that there was reasonable doubt as to the correctness of the trial court's classification of the evidence as true or false.<br\/><br\/>The testimony of the accused in the present case is far from convincing.\u00a0 Go Jancho denied that he was out in the passageway between 1 and 2 o'clock on the morning of the fire, saying that he went to bed about 12 and did not get up until the alarm of fire,\u00a0 or about half past 2 o'clock.\u00a0 Yet we have the positive and unshaken testimony of De la Cruz that he was there between the two houses between 1 and 2 o'clock, fully dressed.\u00a0 Of all the empty petroleum bottles scattered over the\u00a0 house the defendants were unable to either deny or affirm that any of them belonged to the house.\u00a0 These bottles, according to them, were intrusted to the care of muchachos who were not in the house on the night of the fire. Yet, it would seem that some of the inmates of the house would have been able to recognize some of the bottles.\u00a0 It is difficult to account for the presence of these bottles, empty, in the places where the fires occurred.\u00a0 Were they thus carelessly left by the muchachos the last time the lamps were filled?\u00a0 That would be possible, but it does not account for the oil found upon the cloth and upon the rolls of sauale.\u00a0 Nor is it shown that any lamps or other oil-burning receptacles were used in the bodega, where some of these bottles were found.\u00a0 Were they taken from the place where the oil was usually kept by unknown persons on the night of the fire and their contents used in starting the fires?\u00a0 If strangers did this, they must have known the house and it contents intimately and have spent considerable time passing from\u00a0 one room to another while securing and distributing the oil.\u00a0 Furthermore, they must have been daring enough to do these things after the crowd had gathered to put out the fire in No. 30, since it has been shown that the fires in No. 26 were not started until after No. 30 had been burning for a considerable time.\u00a0 Or were the\u00a0 defendants cognizant of the location of the bottles and did they deliberately use them to carry oil to the places where the fires occurred and pour their contents upon the cloth and the sauale?\u00a0 Of all possible explanations of these empty bottles and the traces of oil found in the places where the fires occurred, this is the most convincing.\u00a0 Go Jancho testified in the court below that he saw the saturated cloth\u00a0 but did not know whether oil or water had been poured upon it.\u00a0 The sincerity of such an answer is\u00a0 obviously to be doubted, especially in view of the fact that in his deposition he had admitted that it was oil.\u00a0 The accused stated that they remained on the plaza for nearly an hour while the fire raged in No. 30, without once venturing near to see the fate of their own property.\u00a0 In fact, according to them, they were ignorant of a fire having occurred in their own house until after they had been brought to the police station.\u00a0 Such testimony is not above suspicion.\u00a0 Especially is this so when it is remembered that, according to witnesses for the prosecution, they were all recognized at the very scene of the fire after it had broken out.\u00a0 The defense seemed content to allow the theory of the prosecution that the hole in the partition was made on the night of the fire and that a man could make his escape from the bodega through it.\u00a0 Would strangers have gone to all this trouble and risk in setting fire to the house?\u00a0 Or would it be more likely that the defendants would do this?\u00a0 The trial court was called upon to decide these questions.\u00a0 He heard the testimony, saw the witnesses testify, observed their demeanor on the stand, and refused to credit the testimony of the defendants.\u00a0 But in addition to the adverse inferences suggested by this testimony, it\u00a0 was conclusively proven at the trial: (1) That neither the fire in the bodega nor that in the\u00a0 trastienda of No. 26 caught from the fire in No. 30; (2) that there was no connection between the\u00a0 fire in the bodega and the fire in the trastienda of No. 26; (3) that both the latter fires were of incendiary origin; (4) that the value of the stock of goods in No. 26 was between P5,000 and P8,000; (5) that P25,000 worth of insurance was carried on this stock by the appellants; (6) that the appellants, Go Foo Suy and Go Jancho, were the owners of this merchandise and consequently the beneficiaries of the insurance; (7) that their business operations over a period of approximately eighteen months just prior to the fire had resulted in a loss of at least P4,000.\u00a0 Here we have a fire of incendiary origin and a very powerful motive for starting it.\u00a0 The appellants had been conducting their business at a loss for nearly eighteen months.\u00a0 The success of their crime meant that they would receive about twice the value of their stock of goods and thus convert a losing investment into a profitable one.<br\/><br\/>In State <i>vs<\/i>. Ross (77 Kan., 341), an arson case, it was said that the testimony showed a singular state of affairs, but its weight and credibility was for the jury.\u00a0 Having been found true by the jury and approved by the trial court, the appellate tribunal decided that its sufficiency could not be successfully controverted before it.<br\/><br\/>To the same effect is People <i>vs<\/i>. Stewart (163 Mich., 1).\u00a0 In this case there was evidence tending to show that the buildings were insured for less than they were worth.<br\/><br\/>In State <i>vs<\/i>. Henriksen (116 Minn., 366), it was said in sustaining a conviction;<br\/><blockquote>\"That some one deliberately set the house on fire after making careful plans for the success of the deed is a conceded fact in the case.\u00a0 The only question before the jury was whether defendant either alone or in collusion with his wife laid these plans and fired the building, or whether it was the act of some third person.\"<\/blockquote>In People <i>vs<\/i>. Mix (149 Mich., 260), the evidence used in securing a conviction was wholly circumstantial, but the appellate court sustained the verdict of guilty, notwithstanding that evidence was offered by the defendant tending to prove an alibi, the court saying that the persons who so testified could have been mistaken.\u00a0 In this case the building was insured, but evidently not to an exorbitant figure.<br\/><br\/>In United States <i>vs<\/i>. Benitez and Lipia (18\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 513), an arson case, this court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"In a conflict of testimony such as is presented in this case, this court must depend to a considerable extent upon the discernment of the judge who sits at the trial.\u00a0 A careful and discriminating trial judge has unequaled advantages in determining the relative credibility of opposing witnesses.\u00a0 If he exercises his faculties with shrewdness and sagacity, he performs a\u00a0 most valuable work for the\u00a0 appellate court.\u00a0 We have considered this case in a very painstaking manner.\u00a0 We have searched the record for any evidence indicating that the learned trial court was mistaken in his judgment as to the relative credibility of the witnesses or that he had overlooked some fact or circumstance of weight or influence in passing upon the evidence, or that he had misinterpreted the significance of the facts as proved.\u00a0 We have been unable to find from the record that the learned trial court has fallen into such error; and, in accordance with the rule which we have so often laid down, namely, that this court will not interfere with the judgment of the trial court in passing upon the relative credibility of opposing witnesses unless there appears in the record some fact or circumstance of weight and influence which has been overlooked or its significance misinterpreted by him, we decline to interfere with the judgment of the trial court upon the facts in this case.\"<\/blockquote>In the present case the motive for committing the crime was powerful; the incriminating evidence is strong; and suspicion rests upon the exculpatory evidence submitted by the defense in many places.<br\/><br\/>After a most careful examination of the entire record, we are of the opinion that the finding of guilt by the lower court ought not to be disturbed.<br\/><br\/>The appellant Go Foo Suy was offered as a witness in his own behalf by counsel, but upon being refused a Chinese interpreter, counsel declined to permit him to testify.\u00a0 Go Foo Suy himself testified that he had been a resident of Cebu seventeen or eighteen years, and the court observed that the witness was able to testify in the local dialect if he had wished to do so.\u00a0 Moreover, the court stated that an interpreter would translate his statements whenever he found any difficulty in making them.\u00a0 We cannot say that there was any prejudicial error in not allowing the\u00a0 appellant an interpreter.<br\/><br\/>The court found\u00a0 the appellants guilty of frustrated arson and sentenced them under article 549 of the Penal Code for setting fire to a building which they knew at the time to be occupied by one or more persons.\u00a0 It is urged by the defense that the court erred because the evidence shows that all the inmates had left No. 26 when the fires occurred, and, accepting the theory of the prosecution that the appellants started\u00a0 the fire in order to collect the insurance on the merchandise which belonged to them, the offense would fall under article 561 of the Penal Code.<br\/><br\/>Article 561 provides that\u00a0 if the burned things shall be the exclusive property of the incendiary, he shall suffer a penalty of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its maximum degree to <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum degree, if the arson shall have been committed with intent to defraud or cause damage to another.<br\/><br\/>In view of the disposition we propose to make of the case, this proposition requires no attention.\u00a0 In its decision of December 31, 1898, the supreme court of Spain laid down the doctrine that setting fire to the contents of a building constitutes the consummated crime of setting fire to the building.\u00a0 We agree with this doctrine, and it is therefore immaterial that the contents of\u00a0 the building in the case at bar belonged to the defendants themselves while the building belonged to a third person.<br\/><br\/>We think, however, the court erred in applying article 549.\u00a0 An essential element of the crime\u00a0 punished by this article is knowledge on the part of the wrongdoer that the building was \"occupied at the <i>time<\/i> by one or more persons.\"\u00a0 That all the essential elements of a crime must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt does not require elaboration.\u00a0 The facts of the present case do not justify the assertion that the defendants knew the building to be occupied at the <i>time<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>In view of the\u00a0 considerable time which intervened between the discovery of fire in No. 30 and its discovery in No. 26, and considering the noise which must have been made by the crowd which assisted in putting the fire out in No. 30, it is not probable that any person residing in No. 26\u00a0 was caught unawares when the fire broke out in this house.\u00a0 And also bearing in mind the suspicion which rests upon the conduct of all the inmates of this house, we are of the opinion that the defendants ought not to be charged with knowledge that the building was occupied at the <i>time<\/i> they set it on\u00a0 fire.\u00a0 As the damage occasioned by the fire did not exceed 6,250 <i>pesetas<\/i>, the crime of the defendants is punishable under article 550, paragraph 2, in connection with article\u00a0 551, paragraph 1.\u00a0 The aggravating circumstance of nocturnity being present in the commission of this crime, with no extenuating circumstances, the penalty should be imposed in its maximum degree.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court is therefore\u00a0 modified accordingly and the appellants sentenced to ten years and one day of <i>presidio mayor<\/i>.\u00a0 In all other respects the judgment appealed from is affirmed.\u00a0 The appellants will pay the costs of this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

That the answer is vague and ambiguous and contains arguments and conclusions of law instead of facts.\"<\/blockquote>This demurrer was sustained, the court saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"The defendant will amend his answer within five days or the injunction will be permanently granted as prayed for, with costs to the defendant.\"<\/blockquote>To this order the defendant excepted and, not desiring to amend its answer, appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>It is alleged in paragraph 1 that both the plaintiff and the defendants are corporations duly organized under the laws of the Philippine Islands; and paragraph 4 sets forth the resolution complained of, the dispositive part of which is inserted above.\u00a0 The allegations in paragraphs 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8, which are specifically denied in the answer, all (except the fifth) relate to the building of the plant under authority granted by the defendant, the cost of its construction, the legality of the resolution in question, the power of the defendant to pass such resolution, and\u00a0 the damages which will result if that resolution is carried into effect.\u00a0 As before stated, the allegations in paragraph 5 to the effect that the defendants intend and are threatening to close by force and without the intervention of the courts the plaintiff's plant is specifically\u00a0 denied.\u00a0 The issue in this case, according to the pleadings, relates t6 the power of the municipal council to declare the plant of the petitioner a nuisance as operated, and the method of abating it.<br\/><br\/>The municipal council is, under section 39 (<i>j<\/i>) of the Municipal Code, specifically empowered \"to declare and abate nuisances.\"\u00a0 A nuisance is, according to Blackstone, \"Anything that worketh hurt, inconvenience, or damage.\"\u00a0 (3 Black. Com.,\u00a0 216.)\u00a0 They arise from pursuing particular trades or industries in populous neighborhoods; from acts of public indecency, keeping disorderly houses, and houses of ill fame, gambling houses, etc.\u00a0 (2 Bouv., 248; Miller <i>vs<\/i>. Burch, 32 Tex., 208.)\u00a0 Nuisances have been divided into two,classes: Nuisances per se, and nuisances <i>per accidens<\/i>.\u00a0 To the first belong those which are unquestionably and under all circumstances nuisances, such as gambling houses, houses of ill fame, etc.\u00a0 The number of such nuisances is necessarily limited, and by far the greater number of nuisances are such because of particular facts and circumstances surrounding the otherwise harmless cause of the nuisance.\u00a0 For this reason, it will readily be seen that whether a particular thing is a nuisance is generally a question of fact, to be determined in the first instance before the term nuisance can be applied to it.\u00a0 This is certainly true of a legritimate calling, trade, or business such as an ice plant.\u00a0 Does the power delegated to a municipal council under section 39 (<i>j<\/i>) of the Municipal Code commit to the unrestrained will of that body the absolute power of declaring anything to be a nuisance?\u00a0 Is the decision of that body final despite the possibility that it may proceed from animosity or prejudice, from partisan zeal or enmity, from favoritism and other improper influences and motives, easy of concealment and difficult to be detected\u00a0 and exposed?\u00a0 Upon principle and authority, we think it does not.<br\/><br\/>In Rutton <i>vs<\/i>. City of Camden, 39 N. J. L., 122, 129; 23 Am. Rep. 203, 209, the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The authority to decide when a nuisance exists is an authority to find facts, to estimate their force, and to apply rules of law to the case thus made.\u00a0 This is a judicial function, and it is a function applicable to a numerous class or important interests.\u00a0 The use of land and buildings, the enjoyment of water rights, the practice of many trades and occupations, and the business of manufacturing in particular localities, all fall on some occasions, in important respects, within its sphere.\u00a0 To say to a man that he shall not use his property as he pleases, under certain conditions, is to deprive him <i>pro tanto<\/i> of the enjoyment of such property.\u00a0 To find conclusively against him that a state of facts exists with respect to the use of his property, or the pursuit of his business, which subjects him to the condemnation of the law, is to affect\u00a0 his\u00a0 rights in a vital point.\u00a0 The next thing to depriving a man of his property is to circumscribe him in its use,\u00a0 and the right to use property is as much under the protection of the law as the property itself, in any other aspect, is, and the one interest can no more be taken out of the hands of the ordinary tribunal than the other can.\u00a0 If a man's property cannot be taken\u00a0 away from him except upon trial by jury, or by the exercise of the right of eminent domain upon compensation made, neither can he, in any other mode, be limited in the use of it.\u00a0 The right to abate public nuisances, whether we regard it as existing in the municipalities, or in the community, or in the land of the individual, is a common law right, and is derived, in every instance of its exercise, from the same source that of necessity.\u00a0 It is akin to the right of destroying property for the public safety, in case of the prevalence of a devastating fire or other controlling exigency.\u00a0 But the necessity must be present to justify the exercise of the right, and whether present or not, must be submitted to a jury under the guidance of a court. The finding of a sanitary committee, or of a municipal council, or of any other body of a similar kind, can have no effect whatever for any purpose, upon the ultimate disposition of a matter of this kind.\u00a0 It cannot be used as evidence in any legal proceeding, for the end of establishing, finally, the fact of nuisance, and if it can be\u00a0 made testimony for any purpose, it would seem that it can be such only to show that the persons acting in pursuance of it were devoid of that malicious spirit which sometimes aggravates a trespass and swells the damages.\u00a0 I repeat that the question of nuisance can conclusively be decided, for all legal uses, by the established\u00a0 courts of law or equity alone, and that the resolutions of officers, or of boards organized by force of municipal charters, cannot, to any degree, control such decision.\"<\/blockquote>The leading case upon this point is Yates <i>vs<\/i>. Milwaukee, (10\u00a0 Wall., 497; 19 L. ed., 984).\u00a0 The following quotation from this case has been cited or quoted with approval in a great number of cases.\u00a0 (See Notes to this case in 19 L. ed., Notes, page 356.)<br\/><blockquote>\"But the mere declaration by the city council of Milwaukee that a certain structure was an encroachment or obstruction did not make\u00a0 it so, nor could such declaration make it a nuisance unless it in fact had that character.\u00a0 It is a doctrine not to be tolerated in this country, that a municipal corporation, without any general laws\u00a0 either of the city or of the State, within which a given structure can be shown to be a nuisance, can, by its mere declaration that it is one, subject it to removal by any person supposed to be aggrieved, or even by the city itself.\u00a0 This would place every house, every business, and all the property of the city at the uncontrolled will of the temporary local authorities.\u00a0 Yet this seems to have been the view taken by counsel who defended this case in the circuit court; for that single ordinance of the city, declaring the wharf of Yates a nuisance, and ordering its abatement, is the only evidence in the record that it is a nuisance or an obstruction to navigation, or in any manner injurious to the public.\"<\/blockquote>In Cole <i>vs<\/i>. Kegler (64 la., 59, 61) the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"We do not think the general assembly intended to confer on cities and towns the power to finally\u00a0 and conclusively determine, without notice or a hearing, and without the right of appeal, that any given thing constitutes a nuisance, unless, probably, in cases of great emergency,\u00a0 so strong as to justify extraordinary measures upon the ground of paramount necessity.\u00a0 The law does not contemplate\u00a0 such an exigency, and therefore does not provide for it.\u00a0 If it did, it would no longer be the undefined law of necessity.\u00a0 (Nelson, J., in The People <i>vs<\/i>. The Corporation of Albany, 11 Wend., 539.)<br\/><br\/>\"Nuisances may be abated by an individual, but they must in fact exist.\u00a0 The determination of the individual that a nuisance exists does not make it so, and if he destroys property on the ground that it is a nuisance, he is responsible, unless it is established that the property destroyed constituted a nuisance.\u00a0 This precise power, and no more, is conferred by the statute on cities and towns.\u00a0 In Wood on Nuisances, section 740, it is said:\u00a0 'If the authorities of a city abate a nuisance under authority of an ordinance of the city, they are subject to the same perils and liabilities as an individual, if the thing in fact is not a nuisance. \" <\/blockquote> In Grossman <i>vs<\/i>. City of Oakland (30 Ore., 478, 483) the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"In our opinion this ordinance cannot be sustained as a legitimate exercise of municipal power.\u00a0 The charter of the city confers upon it the power to prevent and restrain nuisances, and to 'declare what shall constitute a nuisance;' but this does not authorize it to declare a particular use of property a nuisance, unless such use comes within the common law or statutory idea of a nuisance.\u00a0 (2 Wood on Nuisances (3d ed.), 977; Yates <i>vs<\/i>. Milwaukee, 77 U. S. (10 Wall.), 497; Village of Des Plaines <i>vs<\/i>. Poyer, 123 111., 348; 5 Am. St. Rep., 524; 14 N. E., 677; Quintini vs. City Board of Aldermen, 64 Miss., 483; 60 Am.

Rep., 203.)\u00a0 By this provision of the charter the city is clothed with authority to declare by general ordinance under what circumstances and conditions certain specified acts or things injurious to the health or dangerous to the public are to constitute and be deemed nuisances, leaving the question of fact open for judicial determination as to whether the particular act or thing complained of comes within the prohibited class; but it cannot by ordinance arbitrarily declare any particular thing a nuisance which has not heretofore been so declared by law, or judicially determined to be such.\u00a0 (City of Denver <i>vs<\/i>. Mullen, 7 Colo., 345).\"<\/blockquote>In Western &amp; Atlantic R. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Atlanta (113 Ga., 537, 551), after an extensive review of the authorities, the court, per Lumpkin, J., said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is our opinion that the provisions of our code require, when a\u00a0 municipal corporation is seeking to abate a nuisance such as it was alleged the floor of the union passenger station was in this case, that the parties interested be given reasonable notice of the time and place of hearing at which the fact whether the property complained of is or is not a nuisance shall be inquired into and determined; that, without such notice and a judgment on the facts by the body invested with power to abate the nuisance, it is unlawful to enter thereon and remove or destroy it as a nuisance.\u00a0 If the thing, as we have said, is declared by law to be a nuisance, or if it is unquestionably a nuisance, such as a rabid dog, infected clothing, the carcass of a dead animal on a private lot, the presence of a smallpox patient on the street, it may be abated by the municipal authorities at once, by order, from the necessity of the case, and to meet an emergency which exists, to at once protect the health and lives of the people.\"<\/blockquote>In Everett <i>vs<\/i>. City of Council Bluffs (46 Ia., 66, 67), where the council passed an ordinance declaring trees on certain streets to be a nuisance and ordering the marshal to abate the same, the court held:<br\/><blockquote>\"The defendant is incorporated under a special charter, which provides that the city council has power to declare what shall be a nuisance, and to prevent, remove, or abate the same.' This general grant of power, however, will not authorize the council to declare anything a nuisance which is not such at common law, or has been declared such by statute.\"<\/blockquote>In Frostburg <i>vs<\/i>. Wineland (98 Md., 239, 243) the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The first question, then, in the case resolves itself to this, Was the summary proceeding of the apppellants in declaring the two trees in front of the appellee's property to be a nuisance and\u00a0 an obstruction to the paving and curbing of the street, and directing them\u00a0 to be removed and destroyed, so far final as not to be reviewable by the Courts?<br\/><br\/>\"This question we think was in effect settled by this court in the recent cases of New Windsor <i>vs<\/i>. Stocksdale (95 Md., 215) and King <i>vs<\/i>. Hamil (97 Md., 103).\u00a0 In the latter case it is\u00a0 said that equity will not lend its, aid to enforce by injunction the by laws or ordinances of a municipal corporation, restraining an act, unless the act is shown to be a nuisance <i>per se<\/i>.\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"It is clear, we think, both upon reason and authority, that when a municipality undertakes to destroy private property which is not a nuisance <i>per se<\/i>, it then transcends its powers and its acts are reviewable by a court of equity.\"<\/blockquote>In C. R. I. &amp; P. R. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. City of Joliet (79 111., 25, 44) the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"As to the ordinance of the common council of the city of Joliet, of September, 1872, declaring the railroad a nuisance, we regard that as without effect upon the case, although the charter of the city confers upon the common council the power to abate and remove nuisances, and to punish the authors thereof, and to define and declare what shall be deemed nuisances.\u00a0 We will, in this respect,\u00a0 but refer to the language of the Supreme Court of the United States\u00a0 in Yates <i>vs<\/i>. Milwaukee (10\u00a0 Wall, 505).\"\u00a0 (See <i>supra<\/i>.)<\/blockquote>In the leading case of Denver <i>vs<\/i>. Mullen (7 Colo., 345, 353) where an extended review of the authorities is made, the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The basis of authority for the action of the city in the premises is made to rest upon certain provisions of the city charter, and certain ordinances, which are set out as exhibits in the testimony;\u00a0 and the following, among other of the enumerated powers conferred by the legislature upon the city, in said charter, is relied upon, viz:\u00a0 'To make regulations to secure the general health of the inhabitants, to declare what shall be a nuisance, and to prevent and remove the same.'<br\/><br\/>\"The proper construction of this language is that the city is clothed with authority to declare, by general ordinance, what\u00a0 shall constitute a nuisance.\u00a0 That is to say, the city may, by such ordinance, define, classify and enact what things or classes of things, and under what conditions and\" circumstances, such specified things are to constitute and be deemed nuisances.\u00a0 For instance, the city might, under such authority, declare by ordinance that slaughterhouses within the limits of the city, carcasses of dead animals left lying within the city, goods, boxes, and the like, piled up or remaining for a certain length of time on the sidewalks, or other things injurious to health, or causing obstruction or danger to the public in the use of the streets and sidewalks, should be deemed nuisances; not that the city council may, by a mere resolution or motion, declare any, particular thing a nuisance\u00a0 which has not theretofore been pronounced to be such by law, or so adjudged\u00a0 by judicial determination.\u00a0 (Everett <i>vs<\/i>. Council Bluffs, 40 Iowa, 66; Yates <i>vs<\/i>. Milwaukee, 10 Wall., 497.)\u00a0 No law or ordinance, under which the city council assumed to act in respect to this ditch, has been cited which defines nuisances, or within the meaning of which such ditch is comprehended.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"It is only certain kinds of nuisances that may be removed or abated summarily by the acts of individuals or by the public, such as those which affect the health, or interfere with the safety of property or person, or are tangible obstructions to streets and highways under circumstances presenting an emergency; such clear cases of nuisances <i>per se<\/i>, are well understood, and need not be further noticed here to distinguish them from the case before us. If it were admitted that this ditch, by reason of its obstruction to the use of the public streets, at the time of the acts complained of, was a nuisance, it must also be admitted that it was not a nuisance <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">per se<\/span>.\u00a0 It was constructed for a necessary, useful and lawful purpose, was used for such purpose, and therefore in its nature was not a nuisance, as a matter of law.\u00a0 Nor as a matter of fact was it a nuisance while it was no hurt, detriment, or offense to the public, or to any private citizen.\u00a0 If, then, it has become a nuisance, it is by reason of a change of circumstances brought about neither by the ditch itself, nor its use. Indeed, the sole matter complained of, to warrant its being regarded as a nuisance, is the absence of bridges at street crossings.\u00a0 The town has become populous; its growth has extended beyond the ditch and along its line for a great distance; streets laid out across its course have come to be traveled so much, that without bridges, the ditch, as appears by the testimony, has become inconvenient, detrimental, and an obstruction to the full, safe and lawful use of such streets as highways by the public.\u00a0 To this extent, and from these causes outside the ditch and its use <i>per se<\/i>, has the ditch come to be a public nuisance, if, as a matter of fact, it is such.\u00a0 But whether it is such or not is a fact which must first be ascertained by judicial determination before it can be lawfully abated, either by the public or by a private person.\"<\/blockquote>In Joyce <i>vs<\/i>. Woods (78 Ky., 386, 388) the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"There was no judicial determination that there was a nuisance, and no opportunity offered the owner of the lot to contest that matter.\u00a0 Under the exercise of\u00a0 the police power, it may be conceded that municipalities can declare and abate nuisances in cases of necessity, without citation and without adjudication as to whether there is in fact a nuisance.\u00a0 But whenever the action of the municipality in declaring and abating a nuisance goes so far as to fix a burden upon the owner of the property, he is entitled to be heard upon the question as to the existence of the nuisance.\u00a0 This right to a hearing\u00a0 upon this question may come before or after the nuisance is abated, as circumstances may require, but there must be an opportunity offered him to be heard upon that matter before his property can be loaded with the cost of the removal of the nuisance.\u00a0 To the\u00a0 extent that property is thus burdened by the action of the city council, when there is no necessity to\u00a0 precipitate action\u00a0 without adjudication, the owner is deprived of his property, regardless of the law of the land.'\u00a0 The meaning,of that provision of the constitution has generally been construed to be a law that hears before condemning, and arrives at a judgment for the divestiture of the rights of property through what is ordinarily understood to be judicial process\u2014the general rules that govern society in reference to the rights of property; and it is only in extreme cases, where the preservation and repose of society or the protection of the property rights of a large class of the community absolutely require a departure, that the courts recognize any exception.\u00a0 In this case\u00a0 there is no pretense of a necessity for precipitate action.\u00a0 There is no reason why appellant should not\u00a0 have been permitted to test the question as to the existence of the nuisance.\"<\/blockquote>In Everett <i>vs<\/i>. Marquette (53 Mich., 450, 451) the court, per Cooley, J., said:<br\/><blockquote>\"But it is not necessary in this case to determine whether the permission given by the village council was in due form for the purposes of a permanent appropriation, or even whether the council had the power to consent to such an appropriation.\u00a0 It is undoubted that the council had general control of the streets under the village charter; and it was a part of its duty to prevent the creation of any public nuisance within them.\u00a0 It is not to be assumed that consent would have been given to such a nuisance, and when, by formal resolution the council assumed to give permission to complainant to make the openings and build the stairways complained of it must have been done in the belief that no public inconvenience would follow.\u00a0 If the permission was effectual for no other purpose, it at least rebutted any presumption which might otherwise have existed, that this partial appropriation of the street was <i>per se<\/i> a nuisance.<br\/><br\/>\"If the permission was a mere license, and the subsequent action of the city council is to be regarded as a revocation of the license, it does not follow that the plaintiff has by the revocation immediately been converted into a wrong doer.\u00a0 The question will then be whether the act of the complainant in maintaining his structures constitutes a public nuisance; and while the city council is entitled, under its supervisory control of the public streets, to consider and pass upon that question for the purpose of deciding upon the institution of legal proceedings for abatement, it cannot make itself the judge.\u00a0 Maintaining a nuisance is a public offense; and the fact, as in other cases of alleged criminality, is to be tried on proper accusation and in the regular\u00a0 courts.\u00a0 The mere fact that the party makes use of some part of a public street for his private purposes does not make out the public offense.\u00a0 This was decided in People <i>vs<\/i>. Carpenter (1 Mich., 273), and has never been doubted in this State.<br\/><br\/>\"The city in this case was proceeding in an act of destruction on an assumption that the structures were already condemned as illegal.\u00a0 This was unwarranted, and it was quite right that the action should be restrained.\"<\/blockquote>The above authorities are collated in Judge Dillon's work on Municipal Corporations, fifth edition, section 634, with the following comment by the author:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is to secure and promote the public health, safety, and convenience that municipal corporations are so generally and so liberally endowed with power to prevent and abate nuisances.\u00a0 This authority and its summary exercise may be constitutionally conferred on the incorporated place, and it authorizes its council to act against that which comes within the legal notion of a nuisance; but such power, conferred in general terms, cannot be taken to authorize the extra judicial condemnation and destruction of that as a nuisance which, in its nature, situation, or use, is not such.\"<\/blockquote>The questions discussed in this august array of authorities are exactly those of the present case, and the controlling principles\u00a0 and the reasoning upon which they are founded are so fully and lucidly set forth as to justify us in refraining from comment of our own.\u00a0 It is clear that municipal councils have, under the code, the power to declare and abate nuisances, but it is equally clear that they do not have the power to find as a fact that a particular thing is a nuisance when such thing is not a nuisance <i>per se<\/i>; nor can they authorize the extrajudicial condemnation and destruction of that as a nuisance which in its nature, situation, or use is not such.\u00a0 These things must be determined in the ordinary courts of law.<br\/><br\/>In the present case it is certain that the ice factory of the plaintiff is not a nuisance <i> per se<\/i>.\u00a0 It is a legitimate industry, beneficial to the people, and conducive to their health and comfort.\u00a0 If it be in fact a nuisance due to the manner of its operation, that question cannot be determined by a mere resolution of the board.\u00a0 The petitioner is entitled to a fair and impartial hearing before a judicial tribunal.<br\/><br\/>The respondent has, we think, joined issue by its answer denying that it was intending to proceed with the abatement of the alleged\u00a0 nuisance by arbitrary administrative proceedings. This is the issue of the present case, and upon its determination depends\u00a0 whether the injunction should be made permanent (but limited\u00a0 in its scope to prohibiting the closing of petitioner's factory by administrative action), or whether the injunction should be dissolved, which will be done in case it be shown that the municipal officials intend to proceed with the abatement of the alleged nuisance in an orderly and legal manner.<br\/><br\/>It is said that the plaintiff cannot be compelled to build its smokestack higher if said stack is in fact a nuisance, for the\u00a0 reason that the stack was built under authority granted by the defendant, and in accordance with the prescribed requirements.\u00a0 If the charter or license does not expressly subject the business or\u00a0 industry to the exercise of the police power by the State, it\u00a0 is conceded by the great preponderance of authority that such a reservation is implied to the extent that may be reasonably necessary for the public welfare. (Freund, Police Power, \u00a7 361 <i>et seq<\/i>, and \u00a7 513 <i>et seq<\/i>.)<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the order sustaining the plaintiff's demurrer to the defendant's answer is reversed.\u00a0 The record will be returned to the court whence it came with instructions to proceed with the trial of the cause in accordance with this opinion.\u00a0 No costs will be allowed in this instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

ELIAS ESTEJADA ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This appeal was raised by counsel for the defendants, through bill of exceptions, from the judgment rendered on October 8, 1912, by the Honorable Vicente Jocson, judge, whereby he held that the land in question, bounded on the north by the Balian River and by the property of Elias Estejada, on the south by that of Pedro Sales and Maximo Heredia, on the east by that of Elias Estejada, and on the west by the Balian River, belonged to the plaintiffs; without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/>On January 13, 1912, counsel for Victoriano Santos and Andrea Espinosa filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance of Laguna alleging that they had been in the peaceable and uninterrupted possession, for the past twenty years, up to October 16, 1911, as owners, of a tract of unirrigated land of about 50 ares and 48 centiares, worth P700, sustaining 160 coco palms, situated in the barrio of Bullero, of the pueblo of Pangil, Laguna, and bounded on the- north by land of the defendants and the Balian River, on the south by land of Pedro Sales, on the east by land of the defendants, and on the west by the said Balian River; that, up to October 16, 1911, they had been in peaceable and uninterrupted possession of the property, and that the defendants had, until then, as tenants-on-shares of the plaintiffs\u00a0 on the said land, recognized the latter to be the owners of the property, but from that date appropriated the same to themselves and refused to recognize the plaintiffs' right of ownership, thus depriving the latter of their possession of the said property, whereby they had suffered losses and damages to the extent of P300.\u00a0 Said counsel therefore prayed that judgment be rendered holding the land to belong to the plaintiffs, and sentencing the defendants to deliver the same to the plaintiffs and pay them the sum stated, as an indemnity for losses and damages, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendants admitted in his answer the first paragraph of the complaint and denied generally and specifically each and all of the others.\u00a0 As a special defense he alleged that the land referred to in paragraph 2 of the complaint was acquired through purchase in 1863 by the spouses Isabelo Ages and Justa Acaylar, from whom it was inherited by their grandson, Domingo Balugay, the present owner and possessor, and that the defendants were mere tenants-on-shares or caretakers of the said Balugay, with respect to the land in question.\u00a0 He therefore asked that the defendants be absolved from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>By a written petition of March 29, 1912, counsel for the plaintiffs requested the court to order the inclusion of Domingo Balugay as a party-defendant in the case, and to allow an amendment to the complaint by adding at the end of paragraph 4 thereof the following words:\u00a0 \"under the pretext that they are simple tenants-on-shares or caretakers of one Domingo Balugay, who claims to be the present owner and possessor of the said land.\"<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendants, by a written motion of April 2, likewise stated that he desired to amend his previous written answer so as to include therein the new defendant, Domingo Balugay.<br\/><br\/>After the hearing of the case and the introduction of evidence by the parties, the court pronounced the judgment cited, to\u00a0 which counsel for the defendants excepted and moved for a new trial.\u00a0 This motion was denied, the appellants excepted and presented the proper bill of exceptions, which was approved and forwarded to this court.<br\/><br\/>It is sought, through an action for the recovery of possession brought by the plaintiffs, to obtain an express declaration from the courts that the land concerned in the complaint is the exclusive property of the plaintiffs, which allegation is denied by the defendants.<br\/><br\/>It is admitted in this suit that the defendants have been holding the said land, although the plaintiffs claim that the defendants were and are in possession of it as tenants of theirs on shares; but the defendants, in turn, allege that they are in charge of the said land as the tenants-on-shares of its owner, Domingo Balugay, and deny that the land belongs to the plaintiffs, Santos and Espinosa.<br\/><br\/>So the question to be decided is:\u00a0 Who is or are the owner or owners of the land in litigation? Its present possessors are mere caretakers of Domingo Balugay, according to the defendants; and of the plaintiffs, Victoriano Santos and Andrea Espinosa, according to them.<br\/><br\/>To decide this suit it must be determined which of the two parties, Victoriano Santos and wife or Domingo Balugay, is the lawful owner of the land in dispute, because the defendants, the Estejadas, hold possession of the land either in the name of the plaintiffs, as the latter's witnesses affirm, or in the name of the defendant Balugay, according to his witnesses.<br\/><br\/>Were it solely a question of a mere right of possession, it is undeniable, notwithstanding the contradictory evidence given by both parties, that, in consideration of the weight and merits of that evidence and of the proved fact that the defendants, the Estejadas, are in actual possession of the land in litigation, this suit should be decided in favor of the defendant Balugay as the present possessor holding through them; but, owing to the nature of the action brought and of the\u00a0 petition made by the plaintiffs in their complaint, it is imperative to decide to whom the control and ownership of the said land lawfully belong.<br\/><br\/>From the evidence presented by counsel for the plaintiffs it does not follow that they are the owners and proprietors of the disputed land, since the document Exhibit A, translated on page 7 of the\u00a0 record, does not constitute a title through which they may have lawfully acquired ownership of said land.<br\/><br\/>Pursuant to the agreement contained in the said document and made between Silverio Adan and Petrona Dionisio, the owners of the land therein mentioned, in consideration of the sum of ten pesos which they received from the spouses Victoriano Santos and Andrea Espinosa, these two latter formed a partnership with the two former for the\u00a0 purpose of utilizing the coffee plants and coconut trees planted on the said land, the products from which were to be divided among the partners, under the obligation on the part of the owners of the land to take care of the crops thereon, under penalty, for failure so to do, of\u00a0 forfeiting all right to the products thereof.<br\/><br\/>This contract, as may be seen by its contents, did not transfer the ownership of the property to the partners Victoriano Santos and Andrea Espinosa, neither does it show that these spouses had any legal reason to support their possession of the said land.\u00a0 The evidence, then, both oral and documentary, introduced by the plaintiffs does not prove in any wise that they were the owners of the land in litigation.\u00a0 The testimony of their witnesses tends only to establish that the defendants, the Estejadas, the present possessors of the said land, hold the same in the name of the plaintiffs; but this is denied by\u00a0 the defendants, who allege that they are in possession of the land as tenants-on-shares and\u00a0 caretakers for Domingo Balugay.<br\/><br\/>It is true that Balugay did not prove, by the documents which he presented to substantiate his allegations, that he acquired the said land through inheritance by having succeeded to the rights of the original owners, Isabelo Ages and Justa Acaylar, his grandparents and ascendants; but it is an unquestionable fact that the documents exhibited by the defendants were delivered to Domingo Balugay in his capacity as heir of his aforesaid ascendants, by Bruno Acaylar, the testamentary executor and administrator of the estate of the deceased Justa Acaylar, an ascendant of the defendant Balugay and the original owner of the land concerned.\u00a0 Therefore the possession of the said land which Balugay has been enjoying, through the other defendants Elias and Maria Estejada, is that of an owner and not of a mere precarious holder.<br\/><br\/>In the decision rendered in the case of Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos de Filipinas <i>vs<\/i>. Miguel Topi\u00f1o et al.\u00a0 (4 Phil. Rep., 33), the rule was laid down that:\u00a0 \"In an action of ejectment the plaintiff seeking to recover possession of land must recover upon the strength of his own title rather than upon the weakness of the title of the defendant, and the burden of showing his title rests upon him who asserts it.\"<br\/><br\/>In the decision of Belen <i>vs<\/i>. Belen (13 Phil. Rep., 202), it is stated: \"Mere possession of the thing claimed is sufficient to insure respect for the present holder, while no other person appears to show and prove a better right, in accordance with the doctrine of the courts.\"<br\/><br\/>In the same decision the following was likewise laid down:\u00a0 \"If the plaintiff, upon whom rests the burden of proving his cause of action, fails to show in a satisfactory manner the facts upon which he bases his claim, the defendant is under no obligation to prove his exceptions or defense.\"<br\/><br\/>In view of the fact that the plaintiffs have not duly proved their title to the land actually occupied by the defendants, the Estejadas, as the tenants-on-shares and representatives of Domingo Balugay, who is found to be the lawful owner of the said land, although the proofs adduced by him are somewhat deficient, there exists no legal ground upon which to deprive him of the possession he now enjoys as owner.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons it is our opinion that, with reversal of the judgment appealed from, we should, and we do hereby, absolve the defendants from the complaint filed by the\u00a0 plaintiffs; without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

Somes, the defendant herein, as one of the sureties While the suit for this installment was pending, the succeeding installment, amounting to P38,000, fell due.\u00a0 Default in its payment having been made, suit was brought in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila (No. 3829).\u00a0 In this case, at the instance of Molina, a receiver was appointed to take possession of the property of De la Riva.\u00a0 Molina succeeded in this action.\u00a0 De la Riva again appealed to the Supreme Court, where the judgment was affirmed,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[2]<\/sup> while the receivership granted in that action was declared void.\u00a0 When the first case (No.3402) was returned to the Court of First Instance after affirmance, De la Riva's property was still in the hands of the receiver; and, as execution against property thus in <i>custodia legis<\/i> could not be had, the Court of First Instance, on motion, entered judgment against the sureties on the <i>supersedeas<\/i> bond, including Somes, defendant herein.\u00a0 The sureties appealed from this judgment, their appeal being docketed as 3412,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> and the order of the Court of First Instance was affirmed.\u00a0 The judgment in case No. 3402, which was the judgment on the first unpaid installment, was then satisfied out of the property of Somes.\u00a0 On the 19th of February, 1907, said Molina obtained another judgment against De la Riva in the Court of First Instance on the last installment due under the contract.\u00a0 Therefore, early in 1907 the situation was this:\u00a0 Somes had paid the judgment in case 3402 and was, therefore, a creditor of De la Riva for about P34,000.\u00a0 Molina had two judgments against De la Riva, in cases 3829 and 4766, aggregating about P81,000.\u00a0 The property of the debtor was released from the receivership and the question of priority arose between the creditors Somes and Molina.\u00a0 Gibbs, Gale and Carr, who had served De la Riva as attorneys, had taken judgment by default against De la Riva for P4,500 and had levied upon practically all his real estate.\u00a0 The levy had been suspended by the receivership, but was revived when the receivership was terminated by the judgment of the Supreme Court and said levy was terminated by a sale in the month of January, 1907.\u00a0 Molina obtained writs of execution on his two judgments, and levied on the property of De la Riva, including the equity of redemption of the real estate sold under the execution in favor of Gibbs, Gale and Carr.\u00a0 On the 26th of April, 1907, the defendant Somes filed a complaint against\u00a0 Molina and others in the Court of First Instance of Manila (No. 5448), alleging that by his payment of the judgment he had become subrogated to the rights of the judgment creditor in case No. 3402, and that, because this judgment was senior to Molina's judgments in cases Nos. 3829 and 4766, he was entitled to a postponement of Molina's executions above mentioned until he, Somes, should have reimbursed himself out of De la Riva's property.\u00a0 Molina entered a demurrer to this complaint, which was sustained.\u00a0 Somes appealed, the case becoming in this court R. G. No. 4149.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> On this appeal Somes asked for and obtained from the Supreme Court a preliminary injunction in said action dated August 3, 1907, restraining further proceedings in the execution of Molina's judgments in cases Nos. 3829 and 4766.\u00a0 A bond for the injunction in the sum of P10,000 was given, signed by Gabriel Schmid, Cristina Gaskell and Fridolin Wiget as sureties.\u00a0 It was not signed by Somes.<br\/><br\/>The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Court of First Instance entered on the order sustaining the demurrer and returned the case for further proceedings, leaving the injunction above referred to in full force and effect.\u00a0 (9 Phil. Rep., 653.)\u00a0 The Court of First Instance found in favor of Somes, holding that he was entitled to satisfy his judgment of P34,000 out of the specific property levied upon by Molina and belonging to De la Riva in preference to and ahead of Molina.\u00a0 Molina appealed but was unable to furnish a <i>supersedeas<\/i> bond; and Somes secured a writ of execution in case No. 3402, levied on all the property of De la Riva, sold it at public sale in due form of law, and bought it himself for P10,000.\u00a0 The legality and validity of the sale are not in question.\u00a0 On that appeal this court reversed the Court of First Instance, holding that, as to the specific property levied upon and then in the hands of the sheriff, Molina's judgments were entitled to preference over that of Somes (15 Phil. Rep., 133) in the distribution of the proceeds.<br\/><br\/>Molina thereupon in July, 1910, began the present action against Somes and the sureties on the bond given to obtain the injunction of August 3, 1907, praying for judgment against the sureties for the amount of the bond, P10,000, and against Somes for the value of the property of De la Riva out of which Molina might have satisfied his executions in 1907, except for what he terms Somes' unjustifiable interference.\u00a0 The Court of First Instance after trial, gave judgment against the sureties for P10,000 upon the bond, and against Somes for P11,000 on some other theory.\u00a0 No appeal has been taken from the judgment against the sureties. Both Molina and Somes have appealed from the' judgment of P11,000 against the latter.<br\/><br\/>The argument on this appeal discloses that there is a contest between the parties as to the nature of the action brought by the plaintiff and as to the theory upon which it was tried in the court below.\u00a0 In that connection the plaintiff says in his brief in this court:<br\/><blockquote>\"Plaintiff in 1907 held\u00a0 final judgments against Antonio de la Riva aggregating P81,000, and was engaged in the execution of those judgments against the property of the debtor then available for the purpose.\u00a0 The defendant Somes interfered with plaintiff's execution, and successfully maintained his position until all the property of the debtor De la Riva had disappeared and De la Riva had become absolutely execution-proof.\u00a0 This interference on the part of Somes was unlawful, as this court decided in R. G. No.\u00a0 5160 (15 Phil. Rep., 133).\u00a0 It follows that plaintiff has been damaged by defendant's conduct in the amount of the value of De la Riva's property subjected to plaintiff's levy in 1907, if that amount was within the figure of plaintiff's judgments.\u00a0 The only question is the determination of this value, which the trial court found to be P11,000.\"<\/blockquote>He also says:\u00a0 \"The complaint in this case, directed as it is against the sureties on the injunction bond as well as against their principal, is based principally upon the improvident granting of the injunction, but it also contains the statement of a cause of action, fully proven by the evidence, against the defendant Somes independently of the injunction proceedings.\u00a0 The Court of First Instance, in case No. 5448, entered a judgment in favor of Somes declaring that he was entitled to execute his judgment in case No. 3402 in preference to the execution of plaintiff's judgments in cases 3829 and 4766.\u00a0 This decision of the Court was subsequently reversed by the Supreme Court in R. G. No. 5160 (15 Phil. Rep., 133).\u00a0 If plaintiff had been able to furnish a <i>supersedeas<\/i> bond in case No. 5448, he would have enjoyed the fruits of his successful appeal in that case.\u00a0 As he was not able to effect the <i>supersedes<\/i>, Somes proceeded to execute his judgment by obtaining a writ of execution in No. 3402 and enforcing it, taking the risk of a reversal upon plaintiff's appeal.\u00a0 It can hardly be doubted that if Somes had retained the property\u00a0 of De la Riva which\u00a0 he bought on his execution sale in case No. 3402 Molina, upon securing the reversal in R. G. No. 5160, could have levied in. execution of his judgments upon the property in Somes' possession.\u00a0 It necessarily follows that as Somes had conveyed that property to a third person, Jose Fortis, so that plaintiff could no longer follow it, Somes had damaged plaintiff to the extent of the value of the property on which Somes levied in consequence of the erroneous judgment of the Court of First Instance in Case No. 5448.\u00a0 It is submitted that when an appeal is taken without <i>supersedeas<\/i>, and the judgment appealed from is executed, and subsequently reversed, the appellee is bound to restore the <i>status quo ante<\/i> or respond in damages for his failure or inability so to do.\u00a0 Regardless of the injunction proceedings, therefore, Sr. Somes is bound to give effect to the decision of this court that the judgments of Molina were entitled to preference over that of Somes and to undo the consequences of the erroneous judgment of the Court of First Instance.\"<br\/><br\/>We cannot agree with the appellant Molina that the action is not only one for the recovery of damages by reason of the issuance of an injunction but also one to recover damages sustained by reason of the execution of a judgment which was afterwards reversed on appeal.\u00a0 It appears to us from the complaint and the opinion of the court below and the general attitude of the parties, both in the court below and here, that the complaint presents, from every possible legal aspect, simply an action to recover damages alleged to have been occasioned by the defendant Somes suing out a temporary injunction which was subsequently vacated by a final judgment of the Supreme Court.\u00a0 It seems to have been tried\u00a0 altogether on that theory. The judgment of the Court of First Instance seems also to rest entirely upon that theory.\u00a0 The\u00a0 results of that theory, as well as the theory itself, have been accepted by the plaintiff not only as against the sureties on the bond, who have not appealed from the judgment rendered against them on that undertaking, but also as against Somes, the judgment against whom in the Court of First Instance based on the injunction theory has been accepted by him (the plaintiff) in that court, as in this, he appealing from such judgment only by reason\u00a0 of the amount.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph II of the complaint sets out the ownership of certain judgments upon which he (plaintiff) had issued executions.\u00a0 Paragraph III alleges the obtaining by Somes of the preliminary injunction from the Supreme Court, restraining Molina from proceeding further in the execution of those two judgments.\u00a0 Paragraph IV alleges the making of the bond preliminary to the injunction and states who were the persons signing the same.\u00a0 Paragraph V alleges the ownership by Somes of a judgment against De la Riva, against whom the plaintiff also held the two judgments theretofore referred to in the complaint and alleges that \"on the 10th day of May, 1909, he executed said judgment, and upon said execution had sold, and himself bought, all the property, real and personal, of the aforesaid Antonio de la Riva,, while this plaintiff was still under the restraint of the aforesaid preliminary injunction, and thereafter sold and transferred to a third party all of the property by him acquired as aforesaid on the execution sale.\"\u00a0 The last paragraph\u00a0 of the complaint alleges the value of the property and the fact that De la Riva is insolvent and has no property out of which the plaintiffs judgments may be paid.\u00a0 It also alleges \"that the aforesaid preliminary injunction, notwithstanding diligent effort on the part of this plaintiff to have the same vacated, remained continuously in force until after the aforesaid execution sale of the defendant Enrique F. Somes, and until after the disposition by said Somes of the property by him acquired as aforesaid at said sale.\u00a0 That said injunction was improperly issued, and that the defendant Enrique F.Somes was not entitled to said injunction nor to restrain the execution by this plaintiff of the latter's judgments against Antonio de la Riva, and that said execution was issued solely upon the affidavit of the defendant Enrique F. Somes, and that the allegations of said affidavit had been conclusively adjudged to be untrue by the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands in cause No. 5448 of the docket of this court.\" Then follows the prayer for relief, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Wherefore plaintiff prays that judgment be rendered against\u00a0 defendant Enrique F. Somes for the sum of P80,818.06 Philippine\u00a0 currency, with interest thereon at 5 per cent per annum from July 27, 1903, and against the defendants Gabriel Schmid, Cristina Gaskell de Schmidt, and Fridolin Wiget, jointly and severally, for the sum of P10,000 Philippine currency, and that plaintiff recover his costs in this action, and for such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper.\"<\/blockquote>In its opinion the Court of First Instance says:<br\/><blockquote>\"This case is before the court for trial upon a complaint by the plaintiff to recover from the\u00a0 defendant Enrique F. Somes the sum of P80,818.06 and from the other defendants the sum of P10,000, alleged to be damages suffered by the plaintiff on account of an injunction issued at the request of the defendant Somes, and a bond given upon which the other defendants were sureties and by which the plaintiff was restrained from levying an execution to satisfy judgments obtained by him.<br\/><br\/>\"The defendant Somes answered admitting practically all the allegations of the complaint, except those which alleged that he was the owner of a judgment against one Antonio de la Riva and had levied execution issued on it, and had sold all of De la Riva's property, and that the property sold was sufficient to satisfy all of plaintiff's judgments:\u00a0 That De la Riva was insolvent, and alleged as a special defense that he had obtained an injunction against the plaintiff and several other persons which after being se aside was finally left in full effect, and that prior to all proceedings Gibbs, Gale &amp; Carr had obtained judgment against Antonio de la Riva, levied execution under it, and sold all of the real estate of De la Riva in the Island of Gatanduanes, and also\u00a0 alleged that he, the defendant Somes, had never levied upon or sold\u00a0 such real estate; but that having obtained judgment against De la Riva execution issued, and was levied upon the property of De la Riva, and the property sold for Pl0,000.\"<\/blockquote>The court further says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The defendants insist that the plaintiff cannot recover in this action because the damages suffered on account of conditions which appear from the pleadings must be assessed in the action or proceeding and in the court trying the action; that is, the action in which the injunction was issued, which was the basis of the damages.\"<\/blockquote>The court then takes up the questions of procedure relative to the recovery of damages sustained by reason of the issuance of an injunction, and discussed whether or not the proceedings instituted for that purpose should be brought in the same action in which the injunction was issued as an incident thereof, or whether they should be carried on in a separate action.\u00a0 After thorough consideration it was held that such proceeding must be brought and carried on in the same action as an incident thereof. The decision concludes as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The defendant Somes having stopped the plaintiff from recovering upon\u00a0 his judgments, for reasons which were afterwards found to be not valid, is liable for any damages which the plaintiff may have suffered on account thereof, and the other defendants, as his sureties, are also liable to the extent of their bond.<br\/><br\/>\"The defendant Somes, while the injunction was in force, having levied upon and sold the property which the plaintiff was restrained from selling, under his execution, having left the plaintiff without other property of his judgment debtor against which to proceed, has damaged the plaintiff to the extent of the value of the property which plaintiff had levied upon, at the time he was restrained from proceeding with the sale.\"<\/blockquote>On his appeal to this court, the plaintiff presented the following assignment of errors:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. That the said Court of First Instance found as a fact that the damages suffered\u00a0 by plaintiff amounted only to P11,000.<br\/><br\/>\"2. That the said Court of First Instance of Manila rendered judgment against the defendant Enrique F. Somes in the sum of P11,000 instead of in accordance with the prayer of plaintiff's complaint.\"<\/blockquote>The opening paragraph of plaintiff's brief on appeal is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Plaintiff in 1907 held final judgments against Antonio de la Riva aggregating P81,000, and was engaged in the execution of those judgments against the property of the debtor then available for the purpose.\u00a0 The defendant Somes interfered with plaintiff's execution, and successfully maintained his position until all the property of the debtor De la Riva had disappeared and De la Riva had become absolutely execution proof.\u00a0 This interference on the part of Somes was unlawful, as this court decided in R. G. No. 5160 (15 Phil. Rep., i33).\u00a0 It follows that plaintiff has been damaged by defendant's conduct in the amount of the value of De la Riva's property subjected to plaintiff's levy in 1907, if that amount was within the figure of plaintiff's judgments.\u00a0 The only question is the determination of this value, which the trial court found to be P11,000.\"<\/blockquote>The first intimation that the defendant had, so far as shown by the record, that plaintiff based his right to recover upon the theory of restitution appears in that portion of plaintiff's brief devoted to answering defendant's brief on appeal.\u00a0 Although one of the special defenses interposed by the defendant Somes to plaintiff's complaint in the court below was that the property of De la Riva was not lost to plaintiff by reason of the injunction, which was the basis of his complaint, but, rather, by reason of the execution of the judgment of the Court of First Instance in case No. 5448 which determined that Somes' judgment was entitled to preference over the two judgments of Molina, in spite of this plain contention of the defendant that the cause of all the damages, if any, was the execution of said judgment, nevertheless, the plaintiff did not amend his complaint to meet that suggestion, but,instead, elected to proceed and did proceed and tried his case\u00a0 upon, the theory upon which he had already placed himself.<br\/><br\/>We conclude, then, that the plaintiff cannot, under these circumstances, be allowed, at this time, to change the theory and nature of his cause of action and recover upon grounds never heretofore set forth.<br\/><br\/>This conclusion is necessary for several reasons, in addition to the surprise of the defendant which would naturally follow such a change:<br\/><br\/>First.\u00a0 Because the findings and judgment of the court of first instance, based upon the improvident issuance of an injunction, have been accepted by the plaintiff in every particular except that relating to the <i>amount<\/i> of damages.<br\/><br\/>Second.\u00a0 Because the theory of an action based upon the improvident issuance of an injunction is incompatible with a cause of action based upon the theory of restitution, for, if the damages were actually caused by the execution of the judgment in cause No, 5448, then they could not have been caused by the issuance of the injunction.\u00a0 The injunction did no more than tell Molina to hold on.\u00a0 It did not order, him to turn the property over to Somes or anybody else.\u00a0 It was restraining, not mandatory. But even if Molina had been under the restraint alleged, he suffered no injury thereby, as the judgment in case No. 5448 was in force against Molina and he could not,-in the face of it, have applied such property to the payment of his own debt.\u00a0 Under the judgment, Somes had the sole right to\u00a0 do that.\u00a0 Molina was powerless to benefit himself with De la Riva's property if there had been no injunction whatever.\u00a0 Somes took and Molina lost the property not because of any restraint imposed on the latter, but by reason of judgment rights of the former.<br\/><br\/>Third.\u00a0 The plaintiff already has a judgment against the sureties upon the bond given to secure the injunction and also a judgment against Somes based expressly upon the improvident issuance of that injunction.\u00a0 To permit the plaintiff now to recover upon\u00a0 the theory of restitution would be to permit him to obtain two final judgments in the same cause, each of which is based upon the theory that the other is wrong.\u00a0 If the damages were caused by the execution of the judgment of the Court of First Instance in case No. 5448, then the final judgment against the original codefendants of Somes on the theory that the damages were caused by the injunction is entirely without foundation.\u00a0 We do not believe that the plaintiff ought to be permitted to retain the benefits of the final judgment against the bondsmen and also to recover and take the benefits of a judgment against the principal upon a cause of action which proceeds on the theory that said bondsmen are not liable.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff, then, must recover, if he recover at all, upon the allegations of his complaint which presents a cause of action solely of damages sustained by the obtaining of an injunction, <i>and upon which theory the cause was presented, tried, decided, and judgment accepted.<\/i><br\/><br\/>We are unable to see how the plaintiff can recover on the theory presented.\u00a0 It is conceded that Somes did not sign or otherwise agree to the bond upon which the injunction was obtained.\u00a0 He cannot, therefore, be held upon it.\u00a0 The statute which provides for the issuance of injunctions and for the undertakings which are the basis of their issuance nowhere lays down a different rule of liability than that established by the general principles of the law.\u00a0 The statute prescribed the method by which a party may make himself liable for the damages resulting from an injunction.\u00a0 It nowhere makes him responsible in any way apart from the bond itself.\u00a0 As a necessary consequence, in determining whether or not Somes, in this view of the case, is liable in the action at bar, we must revert to the general principles of the law.\u00a0 In doing this we observe at the outset that the complaint does not allege any facts upon which the defendant can be held liable; nor does the evidence, as disclosed by the opinion of the court below, contain a particle of proof which would tend to establish his liability.\u00a0 In an action for improperly suing out an injunction, the same principles apply as in cases where it is sought to make a plaintiff liable for bringing an action.\u00a0 The two essential requisites are malicious prosecution and lack of probable cause.\u00a0 These are neither alleged nor proved in the case before us.<br\/><br\/>It may be true that Molina would have gone and collected his executions if Somes had not begun his action, and that he probably would have been the gainer by so much as he received from such collection, but it in nowise follows that because Somes brought the action he is liable for anything that Molina may have failed to\u00a0 collect by reason thereof.\u00a0 In every case where one brings an action against another and fails to recover, the one against whom the action was brought has in a real sense been injured and damaged by the action.\u00a0 He has been troubled.\u00a0 He has hired lawyers.\u00a0 He has procured witnesses.\u00a0 He has paid out money.\u00a0 He may have been obliged to neglect his business and his profits may have materially decreased.\u00a0 He may have been injured in his credit and standing.\u00a0 That does not mean, however,that he can recover from the plaintiff the damages which he suffered by reason of the action having been brought.\u00a0 If that were the case, there would be an end of actions in court.\u00a0 It is to prevent such a condition that the law has laid down a rule relative to the liability incurred in bringing an action different from that applicable in cases where damages are sustained by reason of a direct act.\u00a0 Before one can recover damages from another by reason of an action having been brought against him, he must show not only that there was a lack of probable cause but that the action was maliciously brought.\u00a0 In the case at bar, nothing happened to Molina by reason of any act of Somes except that which naturally followed from the bringing of the action, assisted by the voluntary acts of Molina, for which latter the bringing of the action was in no way responsible.<br\/><br\/>What we have said relative to the bringing of an action will apply to the issuing of an injunction.\u00a0 In many actions the obtaining of an injunction is the essence of the recovery, and without it a judgment would be worthless.\u00a0 One who brings an action has a right to all of the incidents and aids which the law joins to that action.\u00a0 Therefore, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, there is no more liability incurred in securing an injunction than there is in bringing an action; and damages for the improper suing out of an injunction will lie only upon the same basis\u00a0 and for the same reasons as actions for damages for bringing an action.<br\/><br\/>This proposition is founded upon reason as well as authority.\u00a0 It is apparent that in many cases actions are entirely futile unless the plaintiff can take advantage of some preliminary remedy.\u00a0 To that end, legislatures have provided, in various states and countries, that in certain kinds of action the plaintiff, may, upon meeting expressed conditions do certain things as preliminary remedies, which will insure the efficacy of his judgment, if he secures one.\u00a0 A familiar example of such a preliminary remedy is the injunction.\u00a0 It is clear, and is demonstrated every day in actual practice, that many actions would be fruitless if the plaintiff could not obtain an injunction to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i> until the final determination of the rights of the parties.\u00a0 It having been ascertained by the settled experience of society that an injunction is in many cases, a necessary prerequisite to an action, reason as well as logic would, so far, as the liability of the person suing out the injunction is concerned, require that the same principles apply as govern in an action brought to recover damages for the wrongful bringing of an action.\u00a0 In other words, the principles of liability which control where a plaintiff is sued for wrongfully bringing an action should be the same principles which govern in an action brought for the wrongful suing out of an injunction.\u00a0 The injunction is a necessary incident or part of the action.\u00a0 It is absolutely essential to the action.\u00a0 The action is worthless without it. It would be surprising to see the act relating to the main thing, namely, the action, governed by one principle, while the act relating to that which is the essential incident or part of the action, namely, the injunction governed by another and different principle<br\/><br\/>The attempt to secure that which the law gives for the purpose of making the action worth bringing, and without which it would be entirely barren, should not entail a greater responsibility than would the bringing of the action itself, to which it is appurtenant, and to which it necessarily\u00a0 and really belongs.<br\/><br\/>The assertion by some text writers and courts that the one who sues out an injunction without legal cause is liable on the theory that he wrongfully induced or moved the court to take the action which it did, is, in our judgment, without stable foundation.\u00a0 He who obtains a thing by permission of the law, and by strict compliance with the law, ought not to be held liable in any manner except that specified in the law under which he operates.\u00a0 He ought not to be held for a trespass or other wrong, as they assert he may be in replevin, etc.\u00a0 How can it be logically said that one who, acting in good faith, obtains an injunction or property under a replevin in precisely the manner required by law has committed a <i>legal<\/i> wrong against the person as to whom the law authorizes him to obtain the injunction?\u00a0 The law itself, by virtue of the conditions which it imposes, fully protects the defendant against the evil effects of the injunction; and if the party securing the injunction has performed all that the law requires of him as a condition precedent to\u00a0 obtaining it, what more can be asked?\u00a0 In return for the restrictions of the injunction, the defendant has been given certain legal rights against the plaintiff by way of an undertaking which, <i>by virtue\u00a0 of the law itself<\/i>, fully compensates him for the change of position.\u00a0 The bond is full compensation for the privileges which the plaintiff receives and for those which the defendant loses.\u00a0 The law says so.\u00a0 The statute asserts that the doing of certain things by the plaintiff shall be a complete compensation to the defendant for that which the law requires him to give up.\u00a0 If it is not <i>complete compensation<\/i>, then the law is unjust, in that it requires the defendant to give up something for which he receives no compensation.\u00a0 It is not to be presumed or believed that the legislature <i>intended<\/i> to do such a thing, and it is not to be presumed or believed that it <i>did<\/i> do it. But, even if the law be unjust, an injustice of the law cannot be cured by an injustice to a party.\u00a0 The giving of the undertaking legally equalizes the status of the two.\u00a0 To put upon the plaintiff the additional burden of a trespass or other wrong would destroy the legal equilibrium and produce an injustice.<br\/><br\/>The assertion of text writers and that the party in cases of replevin or injunction, wrongfully put the court in operation, and that, therefore he is liable as in tort or otherwise apart from his bond to the defendant therefore, is, in our judgment, also unfounded.\u00a0 Such a theory is bad not only for the reasons already given but also for the further reason that it makes the plaintiff an insurer of the judgment of the court.\u00a0 In other words, upon that theory, the plaintiff, before he can safely obtain\u00a0 an\u00a0 injunction or a replevin, must be certain that the court will\u00a0 decide in his favor; that is, the plaintiff must' insure a judgment of the court in his favor, on the pain of being sued in tort or other legal wrong, in addition to his\u00a0 liability\u00a0 resulting from the responsibility of his\u00a0 sureties on the bond. Such a theory nullifies the symmetry of the law and destroys the equality between the parties which the law establishes.\u00a0 As we have said, the statute asserts conclusively that the giving of a bond to the defendant is an exact equivalent for the loss which he sustains by reason of his change of position.\u00a0 In other words, the plaintiff has paid the defendant in full for whatever benefits he has obtained from him.\u00a0 If, now, we add to that payment the obligation to respond to a defense in damage for the commission of a tort or other wrong, we at once destroy that equality which the law has established, and lay a burden upon the plaintiff which, in equity, he ought not to bear and which, under the law, he is not\u00a0 required to bear.\u00a0 The law expressly states what shall be his punishment if he is wrong.\u00a0 Courts cannot by their own fiat add anything more.\u00a0 The injury is caused by operation of the law, not by the act of plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>It is for these reasons, among others, that we have arrived at the conclusion that an action for damages for the improper suing out of an injunction must be maintained upon the same principles which\u00a0 govern an action for the wrongful bringing of an action.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Meyers <i>vs<\/i>. Block (120 U S., 206, 211), the court, having under review this very question, said, in speaking of the principles upon which an action may proceed which is brought for the purpose of obtaining damages by reason of the wrongful suing out of an injunction:<br\/><blockquote>\"Recover, how?\u00a0 By the law of Louisiana damages may be recovered for suing out an injunction without just cause, independently of a bond.\u00a0 (3 La., 291.) But this cannot be done in the United States courts.\u00a0 Without a bond no damage can be recovered at all.\u00a0 Without a bond, for the payment of damages or other obligation of like effect, a party against whom an injunction wrongfully issues can recover nothing but costs, unless he can make out a case of malicious prosecution.\u00a0 It is only by reason of the bond, and upon the bond, that he can recover anything.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Russell <i>vs<\/i>. Farley (105 U. S., 433, 438), Mr. Justice Bradley, in alluding to the practice of courts of chancery in granting injunction, says relative to the fundamental reason why damages cannot be obtained against a person wrongfully suing out an injunction:<br\/><br\/>\"And if the legal right is doubtful, either in point of law or of fact, the court is always\u00a0 reluctant to take a course which may result in material injury to either party, for the damage arising from the act of the court itself is a <i>damnum absque injuria<\/i>, for which there is no redress except a decree for the costs of the suit, or in a particular [proper] case, an action for malicious prosecution.\u00a0 To remedy this defect [difficulty], the court, in the exercise of its discretion, frequently resorts to the expedient of imposing terms and conditions upon the party at whose instance it proposes to act.\"<br\/><br\/>The case of the City of St. Louis <i>vs<\/i>. the St. Louis Gaslight Company (82 Mo., 349-357), says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Thus it will be seen that the liability of the plaintiff in an injunction suit to respond to the defendant for damages after dissolution depended upon his voluntary undertaking contained in the conditions of the decree, or in his separate agreement and\u00a0 bond given to the court or defendant for that purpose.\u00a0 Of course, when the process has been sued out maliciously there may be a right of action in favor of the defendant.\u00a0 But this right depends upon the law governing malicious prosecutions, and has no relation to the claim for damages urged by defendant in this case.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"Such exemption\u00a0 of the plaintiff from damages, in the absence of any terms or conditions accepted by him to pay them, rests upon the broad policy of the law which regards the courts open at all times to all persons for the enforcement of their rights by civil action.\u00a0 Suitors are presumably acting in accordance with law when they obtain in the courts what the courts award them, and\u00a0 should not be punished for accepting what they could not obtain except by such orders and judgments.\u00a0 When a suitor procures a writ or order of injunction upon a fair presentation of facts to the court in good faith he has never been regarded as responsible in damages therefor, either in law or equity, unless he has made himself so by some voluntary undertaking.\u00a0 In such case he stands before the law like a suitor in any other process or proceeding.\u00a0 This I understand to be the rule, as universally recognized and approved.

And did you go into his office?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.\u00a0 I had heard that one Kikoy (Francisco Agravante) wanted to buy a half interest in the cow; and the president said to me:\u00a0 'Don't sell, for I want to buy.'\u00a0 But the president wished to pay only P4.50 for a half interest in the cow, and I would not accept the price because it was very low and I was not tendered the money.\u00a0 The president called Pascual (Canseco), a\u00a0 clerk.\u00a0\u00a0 While Pascual was still in the president's office, the president delivered the certificate and sent it to the treasurer in\u00a0 order that the latter might erase my name and insert that of the president; but the treasurer refused.\u00a0 After the treasurer had given me the certificate, he ordered me to return home; but the president detained me in his office and took my certificate away from me.\u00a0 As soon as he saw that no other name had been substituted for mine, he put the certificate into his pocket and went home.\u00a0 After a while, we (myself and Agravante) also left.\u00a0 Kikoy (Agravante) had offered me P15 for a half interest in the cow, but had not yet given me the money, which he was not to do until the cow should be branded.\"<\/blockquote>The cow was branded with only the municipal iron, for Pellire had no brand; and yet the certificate was issued to him by a clerk of the treasury while the treasurer was present therein.\u00a0 Francisco Agravante, who accompanied Pellire during all these proceedings, corroborated the statements above\u00a0 quoted, and a cousin of his, named Balbino Agravante, those of them relative to the incident that occurred in front of the house of the accused at the time the latter seized the cow and threatened Pellire with imprisonment.\u00a0 Francisco, in relating what happened in the office of the municipal president, said one thing and gave certain details which Pellire did not say and did not give:<br\/><blockquote>\"While we two, Macario and I, were in the president's office, the president said to Macario;\u00a0 'Macario, I have heard that you have offered somebody a half interest in your cow and the president said:\u00a0 'Don't offer it to another, for I'll buy it.'\u00a0 Macario replied; 'I offered it to Kikoy because he asked it of me some time ago.\u00a0 The president insisted on giving Macario Pellire the P4.50 for a half interest in the cow, but Macario would not accept the money, because the price was very cheap.\"<\/blockquote>Pascual Canseco, the treasury clerk alluded to in Macario Pellire's testimony, corroborated the statement concerning him therein made to the effect that he was ordered by the president to insert the latter's name, Paulino Caballero, in the certificate issued to Pellire, instead of Pellire's name, and testified that he consulted the treasurer and that the latter inquired of Pellire:\u00a0 \"Have you come to an agreement?\"\u00a0 As Pellire answered that they had not the treasurer delivered him the certificate and told him to go home,<br\/><br\/>The defense, even prior to this other testimony by the prosecution and subsequent to that given by Pellire, brought up the question as to whether the facts stated by the latter, though they be admitted to be true, involved the crime of robbery or rather perhaps some other crime that could not then be determined, and it did so again after all the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution had been taken; but the court refrained from a final decision of the point.<br\/><br\/>During the course of the trial the defense endeavored to prove that the accusation made by Pellire was the work of the Agravantes and a result of the political dissensions of the general elections, for the accusation was made on the 3d of June, the day before the election, which was held on the 4th.\u00a0 An attempt was also made to prove, by the testimony of the provincial governor, that hard feelings, manifested on several occasions before the provincial\u00a0 board, existed between the treasurer and his employees\u00a0 and the president and his, of the municipality of Badian; that it was seen in the elections that the treasurer was the leader of one party and the president of another; that in such wise the contest was carried on at the polls, the president and his partisans being the successful candidates, and that for this reason on the 12th of June, as soon as the result of the elections was made known, the accusation against the municipal president was brought forward.\u00a0 The defendant stated in his testimony the reasons why each of the Agravantes, young men 24 years of age and school-teachers, both of whom had been dismissed, felt resentment against him.<br\/><br\/>The direct defense consists in the alleged fact that Pellire, needing money, went to defendant's house and transferred to him his rights in the cow, for the price of P27, for which purpose the proper certificate was issued.\u00a0 This document, found in the record, appears to have been issued on June 4, 1912, and was authorized by the treasurer who is said to be an opponent of the president herein prosecuted.<br\/><br\/>Article 502 of the Penal Code prescribes:\u00a0 \"Those who, with intent of profiting thereby, shall take possession of the personal property of another, with violence or intimidation of the person or by employing force with regard to the personal property, are guilty of the crime of robbery.\"<br\/><br\/>One fact is certain and beyond all discussion, as having been alleged by him who claims to be the offended party, to wit, that the cow which is the subject matter of this action was an offspring of another that belonged to the defendant.\u00a0 It is also certain, likewise because so affirmed by the party who claims to have been offended, that the latter was a tenant of the defendant and a herdsman charged with the care of his cows, under an agreement in the beginning that the calves should be divided between them in equal shares, but by a later stipulation, made at the defendant's request, that of each three calves born two of them should belong to the owner and the third to the herdsman.\u00a0 Continuing his testimony, he who appears as the offended party stated that the cow in question was the oldest, that there were two other younger ones, and, finally, that the cow herein concerned was his, as \"his share.\"\u00a0 (Sten. notes, 5.)<br\/><br\/>The legal presumption from these facts is that the cow in question\u00a0 belonged to the defendant.\u00a0 Article 354 of the Civil Code provides:\u00a0 \"The following belong\u00a0 to the owner:<br\/><br\/>1. Natural fruits\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\"<br\/><br\/>Article 355; \"Natural fruits are the spontaneous products of the soil, and the<i> brood <\/i>and all other produce of animals.\"<br\/><br\/>So, for the purpose of obtaining a certificate of ownership, Macario Pellire could not\u00a0 present the document of origin or acquisition that was necessary to enable him to register the animal in his name, for the reason that the cow that produced the offspring was not his, nor could he present a branding iron, wherefore the animal could be branded only with that of the municipality; all of which procedure was a manifest violation of the provisions of Act No. 1147.<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 2.\u00a0 All owners of large cattle shall register at the office of the treasurer of the municipality of their residence the private brand or brands used\u00a0 by them in marking their cattle\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"<\/blockquote>Pellire had no private registered brand of his own, as he himself testified.\u00a0 (Sten. notes, 6.)<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 6.\u00a0 All unbranded cattle not less than two years old found within the jurisdiction of any municipality, shall be branded on the right hip with the registered brand of the owner and counterbranded on the left hip with the registered brand of the municipality in which they are found.\"<\/blockquote>Pellire testified that his private brand was not asked of him, for which reason the animal was marked with only the municipal brand.\u00a0\u00a0 (Sten. notes, 6.)<br\/><blockquote>\"The branding for which provision is made by this section shall be effected in the presence of the\u00a0 municipal president, the municipal treasurer, and the municipal secretary,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"\u00a0 (Sec.\u00a0 6, 2d paragraph.)<\/blockquote>According to Pellire's testimony, neither the municipal president nor the municipal secretary was present.\u00a0 \"Although he had no brand of his own, Lorenzo, a clerk of the treasurer, filled out the certificate and gave it to him.\"\u00a0 (Sten. notes, 6.)\u00a0 \"The\u00a0 municipal secretary did not sign the certificate, nor did I observe that he was there.\"\u00a0 (Sten. notes, 7.)<br\/><blockquote>\"Sec. 9.\u00a0 Persons charged with the duty of branding or registering\u00a0 large cattle and issuing the proper certificates shall satisfy themselves of the ownership of the cattle so branded or registered, and shall take due care that no certificate of ownership is issued to any person other than the proper owner.\"<\/blockquote>What information there was before the issuance of the certificate to Pellire is not shown by the record, for the treasurer did not testify at the trial.\u00a0 Had Pellire testified that the animal was an offspring of a cow that belonged exclusively to the defendant, it can only be conjectured what action would have been taken by the treasurer.<br\/><br\/>So it does not appear strange that the defendant, upon learning that a certificate of ownership had been issued to Pellire, should have demanded that it be made out in his name, which, although he might not have been well possessed of his rights, was the proper lawful course to pursue, in view of those unquestionable facts against which none other were established destructive of such a legal presumption.\u00a0 It was impossible for the coowner to call himself the exclusive owner of the thing held in common, without proof of a partition or division thereof, and thereby such thing would have ceased to be property of joint ownership.\u00a0 This proof was not given, nor even offered.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, this court finds the following questions in the record of the testimony of Macario Pellire:<br\/><blockquote>\"The COURT. Would you have sold the cow (a half interest in the cow was meant) for P15, if the president had offered you the money ?\u2014A.\u00a0 I did not give it to him.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. But you were willing to give it to him for P15, if he had made you the offer?\u2014A.\u00a0 I did not wish to sell.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Why did you wish to sell to Francisco Agravante, and not to the president ?\u2014A.\u00a0 Because I had already closed the bargain with Francisco Agravante.\u00a0 The cow was still a heifer when it was promised to Francisco Agravante.\"\u00a0 (Sten. notes, 7.)<\/blockquote>As hereinbefore stated, he had previously testified:<br\/><blockquote>\"I was called by the president, who said:\u00a0 'Step over here.'<br\/><br\/>\"Q. And did you go into his office?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes sir.\u00a0 I heard that one\u00a0 Kikoy (Francisco Agravante) wanted to buy a half interest in the cow.\"\u00a0 (Sten. notes, 2.)<\/blockquote>Be that as it may, and even if it be admitted as true that the oldest offspring, the one herein concerned (and not one of the two younger animals, for example, the youngest) might pertain to the herdsman, Macario Peliire, as a real one-third interest allotted to\u00a0 him by the\u00a0 agreement, and though it also be conceded as true that he had sold a half interest in that offspring to Francisco Agravante for P15, still the owner of the cow which produced that offspring was entitled to redeem the latter after its sale, for the same price at which it had been sold to that third party,<br\/><blockquote>\"A coowner of a thing held in common may exercise the redemption\u00a0 in case the shares of all the other coowners, or of <i>any of them<\/i>, are sold to a third party.\"\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 1522.)<\/blockquote>Supposing such a sale to have been made in the present case, it would appear unjust that Francisco Agravante, merely through the will of Macario Pellire, assuming that the community of interests was unbroken, should have arrogated to himself rights in Caballero's stock, by claiming to be the coowner of a one-third interest in an animal in which Caballero recognized that Pellire alone had a share.<br\/><br\/>Among the legal redemptions established by the Civil Code, is that of coowners.\u00a0 Article 1521 says: \"Legal redemption is the right to be <i>subrogated<\/i>, with the same conditions stipulated in the contract, in place of the person who acquires a <i>thing<\/i> by <i>purchase<\/i> or in payment of a debt.\"<br\/><br\/>The code refers to things in general.\u00a0 It applies the word <i>thing<\/i>, without\u00a0 adding the qualificative of chattel or of real property.\u00a0 (Manresa, Com.)<br\/><br\/>All the foregoing legal considerations indicate this to be, in its true\u00a0 aspect, a civil question requiring judicial determination before final judgment can be awarded, and which, before any crime was charged, should have been fully examined in the proper jurisdiction.\u00a0 This is not a common case of a public officer wresting through intimidation from the possession of its legitimate owner a thing genuinely another's, as this court has sometimes held was done, nor is it a case of one's seizing a thing belonging to his debtor with the purpose therewith to satisfy the debt, which act is defined by article 498 of the Penal Code as a crime of coercion.\u00a0 Upon the hypothesis that the facts charged are true, it is probable that the defense would have conjectured these conclusions, had it raised, before continuing with the case, a preliminary question relative to the nature of the crime.\u00a0 It is evident that Paulino Caballero did not act as a creditor toward a debtor and seize a thing belonging to the latter in order therewith to satisfy the debt, but, at the worst, his conduct was that of a coowner who, under his own authority (if the charges are true, which is not admitted) wished to exercise the right of redemption with which unquestionably he was civilly vested, a right not comprised within the said article 498.<br\/><br\/>The present status of the case is that of a title of transfer upon which, rightly or wrongly, the defendant relies, a title which, neither civilly nor criminally, has been assailed as false and can not be passed by without the proper judicial pronouncement thereon, inasmuch as it is in form a legal title authorized by a public officer designated by the law, such as was the municipal treasurer of Badian who issued it as the certificate of ownership now required and which constitutes, pursuant to Act No. 1147, a presumption <i>juris tantum<\/i> that the animal in question belongs to the person designated in the said certificate.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is reversed, with the costs of both instances <i>de oficio<\/i> and the reservation to both parties of such civil action as may lie in their behalf.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Carson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur. <\/div>",

He produced Exhibit A, which is evidence against himself. It reads thus:<br\/><blockquote><i>\"Memorandum<\/i>.\u2014Received from Isabelo Olaguer\u00a0 (the defendant)\u00a0 and Gregorio Roble, residents of Danao,Cebu, P.

Jayme Va\u00f1o.\"<\/blockquote>There is not a word in this document which can be invoked by the plaintiff Julian Enriquez, whose name does not even appear in it.\u00a0 The plaintiff failing in his proof, the defendant must be absolved.<br\/><br\/>But in this case Isabelo Olaguer has further in his favor:<br\/><br\/>(1) The fact of his possession, which in itself is sufficient; (2) the above-quoted document, which is proof in favor of the defendant as to acquisition of title on his part;(3) the document, Exhibit 1, of the defendant, which reads thus:<br\/><blockquote>\"The land situated in Mangitngit of the town of Danao of the Province of Cebu, which was mortgaged by Don Narciso Mir y Mir to the undersigned according to the proper deed, No. 202, dated August 4,1886, and which in the letter of the deceased Mir, dated December 3, 1889, he cedes in absolute sale said land to the\u00a0 undersigned on account of the\u00a0 debt of Mir y\u00a0 Mir; he transfers it upon the same conditions for the sum of P100 to Isabelo Olaguer and Gregorio Roble, as per memorandum receipt issued by my attorney, Don J.

Bernabe Reyes.\"<\/blockquote>In face of the lack of any title on the part of the plaintiff and the ample evidence of the defendant, the plaintiff yet prosecuted his claim by means of the present appeal and does not appear to rely upon any other grounds than his possession of the memorandum receipt from Va\u00f1o (Exhibit A) and the fact that the P50 which Va\u00f1o received from Isabelo Olaguer belonged to him.<br\/><br\/>The defendant explains the first fact by saying that when the receipt was drawn in his and Gregorio Roble's favor he gave it to Roble to keep and Roble gave it to the plaintiff.\u00a0 Whatever explanation may be given of this\u00a0 fact, it would not be in itself sufficient to\u00a0 prove ownership in favor of the plaintiff.\u00a0 Previously Isabelo Olaguer and Estanislao Olaguer had been tenants on the land on shares\u00a0 with Bernabe Reyes.\u00a0 It does not appear of record why Julian Enriquez, the plaintiff, would be the successor of Bernabe Reyes in tenancy or lease with Isabelo Olaguer. Isabelo Olaguer had no carabaos for tilling the soil and so informed Bernabe Reyes, proposing that the latter purchase the land.\u00a0 Hence passed into the hands of Isabelo Olaguer through sale the land he was already holding by a lease or on shares with the former owner.\u00a0 That the money, P50, with which Olaguer made the purchase might have\u00a0 belonged to Enriquez, even if true, which it is not for it is\u00a0 not proven, would not necessarily make Enriquez the owner of the land bought.\u00a0 Olaguer would owe\u00a0 him the money, but in buying the land with Enriquez' money he did not have to waste time in going to Bohol and bringing to Cebu the deed of purchase for someone else, when it does not appear that he was doing all this by virtue of authority conferred upon him by this other person.<br\/><br\/>There is a definite provision in the <i>Partidas<\/i> which decides the case.\u00a0 It is law 49, title 5 of <i>Partida<\/i> 5, dealing with the case of those who buy property with another's money, which they have in their possession, and it fixes that as a general rule the property bought belongs to him who bought it with the other's money, laying down exceptions such as the case of money belonging to a minor when the guardian is the one who makes the purchase or dowry money and the husband is the purchaser, etc., under none of which falls the defendant's case, which is only hypothetical after\u00a0 all.<br\/><br\/>Only through a contract proven in this proceeding to the effect that defendant had to buy the land for the plaintiff with the latter's money, for the purpose of continuing the cultivation which he was carrying on with the vendor, inasmuch as he could not purchase it for himself on account of lack of funds, could the complaint have been allowed, but there is not a single fact to this effect in the complaint, still less in the evidence.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent<\/i>, JJ., concur.<\/div>",

ROBERT LINEAU, ADMR., INTERVENER AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\"> Pedro Martinez, the plaintiff in this case, seeks to recover from Matias Cavives and Severino Cavives, the defendants, on some promissory notes executed by them in 1896.\u00a0 The first note, in the sum of $4,317.15 Mexican currency, was executed on April 8 of that year, and was jointly signed by them and their brother Carlos Cavives, now deceased.\u00a0 The note calls for interest at ten per cent per annum.\u00a0 Matias Cavives obtained $300 on April 30, $200 on May 30, and $200 on June 7 of that year, and Severino Cavives, $600 on June 9 (all Mexican currency), each of which stipulated that the sums mentioned therein had been borrowed under the same terms and conditions as were expressed in the joint obligation of the three brothers above mentioned.\u00a0 The due execution of all these notes is admitted.\u00a0 None of these notes were ever paid by any of the three brothers.\u00a0 On June 14, 1898, the deceased brother Carlos entered into an agreement with the plaintiff whereby all the obligations contracted by the three brothers during the year 1896 were liquidated and a new note\u00a0 was executed and signed by these two parties (Exhibit 4), its amount, $9,483, 5 reales, 17 cuartos, purporting to include the principal and interest at the specified rate up to the date of its execution.\u00a0 The evidence of record shows that Carlos Cavives, in\u00a0 executing this note, agreed to obtain the signatures of his brothers to it, but this was never\u00a0 done.\u00a0 During the settlement of the estate of the deceased Carlos, an agreement was entered into by his widow and Pedro Martinez, whereby the latter agreed to accept P3,000 in full satisfaction of his claim against her husband's estate, a sum considerably less than the principal and accumulated interest of the original notes.\u00a0 A note (Exhibit 5) was executed under these conditions, whereby the widow was to pay its face value in annual installments.<br\/><br\/>The contention of the defendants, sustained by the court below, was that the original obligations had been novated by the agreement made in 1898 between Carlos Cavives and Pedro Martinez.\u00a0 It was held that as neither party to this agreement exercised proper diligence in securing the signatures of the other brothers, there was a tacit consent to permit the obligation to stand as a debt against Carlos Cavives alone.\u00a0 The fact that the compromise settlement made between the plaintiff and the widow of Carlos Cavives made no mention of the amounts borrowed by Matias and Severino Cavives was deemed by the court further proof of the intention of the plaintiff to novate the debts of the three brothers and hold only Carlos liable for their payment.<br\/><br\/>Article 1205 of the Civil Code reads as follows:\u00a0 \"Novation, consisting in the substitution of a debtor, in the place of the original one, may be made without the knowledge of the latter, but not without the consent of the creditor.\"<br\/><br\/>So far as Exhibit 4 is concerned, it cannot be presumed that the plaintiff considered the liability of Carlos alone as better than the liability of all three of the brothers, since Carlos promised, at his request, to secure the signatures of his brothers to this document.\u00a0 Nor can it be presumed, in the absence of evidence, that there was any consideration present to induce Carlos to assume what was theretofore strictly a liability of his brothers.\u00a0\u00a0 So that to construe Exhibit 4 to the effect that by its terms Carlos was substituted as the sole debtor of the plaintiff would mean that the latter accepted less security for his loans than he originally had, and that the former assumed liabilities which he was under no obligation to assume and for which there was no valid consideration.\u00a0 At the time this instrument was executed, then, it was\u00a0 not the intention of either of the signers to release these defendants\u00a0 as debtors of the plaintiff.\u00a0 As to the subsequent silence of both parties to this agreement, we do not consider that it was, at least so far as the plaintiff was concerned, of any significance.\u00a0 He signed Exhibit 4 at the time Carlos Cavives signed it on the condition that the latter would secure the signatures of his two brothers to it, thereby creating a joint obligation against the three.\u00a0 Carlos Cavives never secured the signatures of his brothers.\u00a0 The contract in question contained mutual obligations which were to be fulfilled by each of the signers, i. e., on the part of Carlos to secure the signatures of his brothers to the instrument, and then on the part of the plaintiff to recognize it as a joint obligation of the three brothers covering their indebtedness to him.<br\/><br\/>The last paragraph of article 1100 of the Civil Code reads as follows: \"In mutual obligations, none of the persons bound shall incur default if the other does not\u00a0 fulfill or does not submit to properly fulfill what is incumbent upon him.\u00a0 From the time one of\u00a0 the persons obligated fulfills his obligation, the default begins for the other party.\"<br\/><br\/>Until Carlos obtained the signatures of his brothers to this instrument we cannot say that the plaintiff was in any way bound to acknowledge it as anything more than an executory contract containing a condition precedent which was to be performed by Carlos Cavives before his (the plaintiff's) obligation was due.\u00a0 Mere continued silence on his part could signify nothing until the signatures of the two brothers had been secured.\u00a0 As further indication that this contract (Exhibit 4) was not considered as discharging the original obligation of the defendants in this case, it may be noted that the plaintiff has never surrendered, nor was he ever called upon to surrender so far as this record shows, the original promissory notes executed\u00a0 by these defendants.\u00a0 They are still in his possession.\u00a0 Up to the time of the compromise settlement between the\u00a0 plaintiff and the widow of Carlos, at least, there is not a scintilla of evidence to show that either party to the contract of 1898 considered it as a discharge of the original debtors, Severino and Matias Cavives.\u00a0 The compromise settlement with the widow of Carlos, Exhibit 5, is\u00a0 relied upon to show novation.\u00a0 In this document, plaintiff makes the statement, in effect, that the whole sum of the liquidated obligation of the brothers set forth in Exhibit 4 was a liability against the estate of Carlos.\u00a0 It is urged that this shows the plaintiff's intention to novate the debt by substituting Carlos as his sole debtor in lieu of the defendants.\u00a0 There is one fact which points strongly against this conclusion.\u00a0 That is, that the present action against these defendants was instituted some months previous to the date of the compromise settlement and has been prosecuted by the plaintiff with due diligence ever since its institution.\u00a0 But admitting, for the moment, that by this compromise settlement he was desirous of so substituting Carlos as his sole debtor in lieu of the defendants, it does not by any means follow that he could do so without the consent of Carlos.\u00a0 The consent of the new debtor is as essential to the novation as is that of the creditor.\u00a0 As we have seen, there is nothing to show that Carlos ever consented to such an arrangement.\u00a0 Indeed, the evidence is all the other way.\u00a0 A mere recital that he had so consented to accept full liability for the debts of his brothers, especially after his death,\u00a0 would not be sufficient to establish the fact.\u00a0 But we cannot believe that this statement was intended to have any such meaning by the plaintiff in view of the fact that at the time it was made he was actively prosecuting a suit against the brothers who were originally liable as his debtors, and the further fact that the total amount due him, including interest, was greatly in excess of the sum due him in 1S9S,<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, the position taken by these defendants in their amended answer is diametrically opposed to the defense of novation.\u00a0 In that amended answer they say:\u00a0 \"That these defendants have never refused to pay the proportion of the total amount borrowed which they justly owe, that is, one-third of it, to Don Francisco Martinez, or his executor or administrator, or to all of his heirs, but they do refuse to pay to one of the heirs what belongs to all of them.\"<br\/><br\/>Article 1204 of the Civil Code reads:\u00a0 \"In order that an obligation may be extinguished by another which substituted it, it is necessary that it should be so expressly declared, or that the old and new be incompatible in all points.\"<br\/><br\/>In its decision of December 31, 1904, the supreme court of Spain said:\u00a0 \"Novation of contracts cannot be presumed in any case unless it is a necessary result of the express will of the parties, or that the\u00a0 old and the new obligations are incompatible in all points.\"<br\/><br\/>To the same effect is its decision of January 25, 1899.\u00a0 In its decision of March 14, 1908, that high court said (quoting from the syllabus):\u00a0 \"It is not proper to consider an obligation novated by unimportant modification's which do not alter its essence and when it is not extinguished-by another which takes its place or\u00a0 substitutes the person of the debtor.\"\u00a0 To the same effect are the decisions of April 15, 1909, and July 8, 1910.<br\/><br\/>In Latiolais,

Ann., 1444)-, one Duclozel\u00a0 mortgaged property to the defendant bank for the triple purpose of obtaining shares in the capital stock of the batik, bonds which the bank was authorized to issue, and loans to him as a\u00a0 stockholder.\u00a0 Duclozel subsequently sold this mortgaged property to one Sproule, who, as one of the terms of the\u00a0 sale, assumed the liabilities of his vendor to the bank.\u00a0 Sproule\u00a0 sold part of the property to Graff and Chalfant.\u00a0 The debt becoming due, the bank brought suit against the last two named persons and Sproule as <i>owners<\/i>.\u00a0 Duclozel was not made a party.\u00a0 The bank discontinued these proceedings and subsequently brought suit against Latiokiis, administratrix of Duclozel, who had died.<br\/><br\/>The court said:\u00a0 \"But the plaintiff insists that in its petition in the proceeding first brought the bank ratified the sale made by Duclozel to Sproule, and by the latter to other parties, in treating them as <i>owners<\/i>.\u00a0 Be that so, but it does not follow in the absence of either a formal and express or of an implied consent to novate, which should be irresistibly inferred from surrounding circumstances, that it has discharged Duclozel\u00a0 unconditionally, and has accepted those parties as new delegated debtors in his place.\u00a0 <i>Nemo presumitur donare.<\/i><br\/><blockquote>\"Novation is a contract, the object of which is: either to extinguish an existing obligation and to substitute a new one in its place; or to discharge an old debtor and substitute a new one to him; or to substitute a new creditor to an old creditor with regard to whom the debtor is discharged.<br\/><br\/>\"<i>It is never presumed<\/i>.\u00a0 The intention must clearly result torn the terms of the agreement or by a full discharge of the original\u00a0 debt.\u00a0 Novation by the substitution of a new debtor'can take place without the consent of the debtor, but the delegation does not operate a novation, unless the creditor\" has <i>expressly<\/i> declared that he intends to discharge with delegating debtor, and the delegating debtor was not in open failure or insolvency at the time.\u00a0 The mere indication by a debtor of a person who is to pay in his place does not operate a novation.\u00a0 <i>Delegatus debitor est odiosus in lege<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"The most that could be inferred would be that the bank in the exercise of a\"sound discretion, proposed to better its condition by accepting an additional debtor to be and remain bound with the original one.\"<\/blockquote>In Fidelity L. &amp; T. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. (99\u00a0 Va., 168), the court said:\u00a0 \"Whether or not a debt; has been novated is a question of fact and depends entirely upon the intention of the parties to the particular transaction claimed to be novated.\u00a0 In the absence of satisfactory proof to the contrary, the presumption is that the debt has not been extinguished by taking the new evidence of indebtedness; such new evidence, in the absence of an intention expressed or implied, being treated as a conditional payment merely.\"<br\/><br\/>In Hamlin <i>vs<\/i>. Drummond (91 Me., 175; 39 A., 551), it was said that novation is never presumed but must always be proven.\u00a0 In Netterstorm <i>vs<\/i>. Gallistel (110 111. App.', 352), it was said that the burden of establishing a novation is on the party whov asserts its existence; that novation is not easily presumed; and that it must clearly appear before the court will recognize it.<br\/><br\/>There is no express stipulation in any of the documents of record that the obligation of the defendants was novated, and the parol evidence tending to show that it was novated is not sufficient in law to establish that fact.<br\/><br\/>During the progress of this case, Robert Lineau, administrator of the estate of Francisco Martinez, father of the plaintiff, intervened claiming that the obligations of the defendants were justly due to the estate of the said Francisco Martinez.\u00a0 The notes themselves (Exhibit G) make no mention whatever of Francisco Martinez, nor is there any evidence upon which the relation of principal and agent between Francisco Martinez and Pedro Martinez could be predicated.\u00a0 The notes must therefore be declared the sole property of the plaintiff, and the intervener's claim must be denied.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ordered that the defendants Severino Cavives and Matias Cavives, comply with their obligations as set forth in Exhibit G, by the payment of the principal and interest thereon at the rate of ten per cent per annum as called for in the said notes, from the date of their execution up to the full satisfaction of the judgment in this case.\u00a0 It is understood that as to the first note signed by the three brothers, these defendants are each liable for one-third of its principal and accumulated interest; that Matias Cavives is alone liable for the notes executed by him of April 30th, May 30th, and June 7th, 1896, whose amounts are\u00a0 $300,\u00a0 $200, and $200, respectively; and that Severino Cavives is alone liable for the note of June 9, 1896, signed by him, amounting to $600.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is reversed and in accordance with sections 3, 4, and 5 of Act No. 1045, and the decision of this court in Urbano <i>vs<\/i>. Ramirez (15 Phil. Rep., 371), the record will be returned to the court below and a new trial will be had for the sole purpose of ascertaining, after due hearing, the present actual value of Mexican money as compared with Philippine currency, in order to reduce the debt to Philippine currency.\u00a0 Final judgment will then be entered against the defendants in accordance with this decision.\u00a0 Without costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Cadwallader-Gibson Lumber Company, pending in that court.<br\/><br\/>It is alleged in the complaint that on the 2d day of April, 1912, Juan Liwanag instituted a suit for damages against the Cadwallader-Gibson Lumber Company in which the plaintiff alleged that on the 26th of October, 1911, being a laborer in the employ of the Cadwallader-Gibson Lumber Company, and while rendering services to said company as such employee, he was, through the negligence of the company, injured by certain cars belonging to the company to such an extent as to require the amputation of his left arm.\u00a0 After the beginning of such action, on the 16th day of April, 1912, the said Juan Liwanag made a motion in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Wherefore, plaintiff prays the honorable court to order the defendant company to give the plaintiff a monthly pension of P30 during the pendency of this case or to take him back in his former position prior to the filing of his suit.\" <\/blockquote> What occurred upon the motion is best stated by the judge who heard it, who in his answer to the complaint in prohibition states:\u00a0 \"That after hearing the arguments of both parties presented on the motion made by Juan Liwanag relative to maintenance, none of the parties having offered any evidence fior the reason that the question was simply one of the interpretation of Act No. 1874 of the Philippine Legislature, the court resolved the motion in the following terms;\"<br\/><br\/>Then follows the opinion of the court, terminating with the following order, to wit:\u00a0 \"It is hereby ordered that the Cadwallader-Gibson Lumber Company during the pendency of the present action pay monthly in advance and during one of the first five days of each month beginning with the date of this order a pension of P30 to said Juan Liwanag.\u00a0 Said company shall, at its option, have the privilege of employing said Juan Liwanag at the same wages at which it formerly employed him instead of paying the monthly pension hereby ordered.\"<br\/><br\/>The complaint further alleges that said order was illegal and that the court had no jurisdiction to issue the same; that there was no adequate remedy by appeal or otherwise and that great damage would result to the plaintiff in this action if the order was executed.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiff in this court bases his argument upon the unconstitutionality of the statute under which the order in question was issued, alleging that, as interpreted by the court, it deprived the plaintiff of its property without due process of law, in that it ordered it to pay a sum of money monthly without the court having first ascertained and determined, after a hearing and upon evidence, the liability of the plaintiff to the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Counsel also attacks the interpretation placed upon the law by the trial court in its resolution of the motion, asserting that under the terms of the statute, the pension should continue only so long as the injured person should require medical attendance, and not during the pendency of the action or while he was incapacitated.<br\/><br\/>So far as appears from the allegations of the complaint and the record as it is made up, there was no question raised as to the constitutionality of the law in the court below; nor was objection there made either, to the form of the motion, to the form or nature of the hearing on the same, or to the fact that no trial was held to determine, upon the evidence adduced, the liability of the\u00a0 plaintiff.\u00a0 It does not even appear except by inference that the plaintiff objected to the order or took exception thereto.\u00a0 Everything in connection therewith seems to have been done with the acquiescence of all the parties concerned.\u00a0 The first time that an objection was interposed was when this action for prohibition was commenced in this court.\u00a0 It seems to us that, even if a constitutional question is involved, as plaintiff alleges, some foundation must be laid for its presentation to this court.\u00a0 The failure of due process of law may be cured by the consent or acquiescence of the party injured.\u00a0 To raise in this court the question of failure of due process of law in such a way as to make it the basis of an appeal or of an action of prohibition, proper objections must be opportunely made in the court below and exceptions taken by the party who feels himself aggrieved.<br\/><br\/>In connection with the interpretation of the law made by the court\u00a0 relative to the time during which the pension should be paid, it may be said that the mere misconstruction of the statute in this case raises no constitutional question, nor does it raise a question going to the jurisdiction of the court.\u00a0 If anything, it is a mere error, to be corrected in the regular way.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons the action is not maintainable.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that Protasio in fact had no cedula; that the complaint was drawn up on account of his delay in obtaining it; and that had he not signed Protasio's bond the latter would have been imprisoned by the justice.\u00a0 It was admitted that Nicolas Godinez was a general in the revolution.\u00a0 The attorney for the defense tried to bring out that Godinez was also a prominent politician, but the witness declared\u00a0 that he knew nothing about it (pp. 31-35).<br\/><br\/>Vicente Villaflor, being duly sworn, testified\u00a0 substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 33 years old, married, a laborer, and a resident of Moalboal.\u00a0 Protasio is my partner.\u00a0 At 7 p. m. on the 5th I took him to the town hall to get his subpoena.\u00a0 After the president read the subpoena he asked Protasio, 'Are you the offended party in the case of Nicolas Godinez?'\u00a0 Protasio answered that he was.\u00a0 The president then said quickly:\u00a0 'You must be put in jail.'\u00a0 I desired to go his bail, but President Jaca would not admit me without my giving him a <i>ganta<\/i> of cocoa, but I did not have any cocoa.\u00a0 The president then put Protasio in the jail and locked the door and ordered the guard to take charge of him.\u00a0 When he was liberated I started to take him here to Cebu, but he took sick from hunger at Carcar, and I came on without him.\u00a0 The defendant and Nicolas Godinez are political friends.\"\u00a0 (Pages 35-37.)<br\/><br\/>During the cross-examination the witness, in addition to repeating his former testimony, stated that he started to Cebu with Protasio on Thursday, January 9, and that it usually takes one day to go from Moalboal to Cebu on the train and much longer when walking (pp. 37-39).<br\/><br\/>Anastasio Vidal, deputy sheriff of Cebu, being duly sworn, identified Exhibits A, B, and C, which\u00a0 were admitted as evidence for the prosecution.\u00a0 They are documents showing the subpoenas issued and the return certificate of Enrique Jaca in the case of The United States <i>vs.<\/i> Nicolas Godinez (pp. 40-41).<br\/><br\/>Melchor Gonzalez, also a deputy sheriff of Cebu, being duly sworn, identified Exhibits D, E, and F, which were admitted as evidence for the prosecution.\u00a0 They are a copy of the appointment, the oath, and a letter returning the executed oath of Enrique Jaca, who was appointed deputy sheriff of Moalboal (pp. 41-42).<br\/><br\/>Protasio Tramada, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 21 years old, married, a laborer, and a resident of Moalboal, Cebu.\u00a0 I was the offended party in a case against Nicolas Godinez and was subpoenaed to appear in the Court of First Instance in Cebu on January 11, 1913.\u00a0 I did not report to the court as I was put in prison by the municipal president, the defendant in this case, and I took sick.\u00a0 On Sunday evening the president asked me to sign a receipt for the subpoena.\u00a0 After signing it he asked me if I was the complainant in the case against Godinez, and I told him\u00a0 that I was.\u00a0 The president then took me downstairs and put me in the jail, and I did not get out until 5.30 p. m. on Monday.\u00a0 I had nothing to eat from the time I was imprisoned until 7 o'clock Monday evening.\u00a0 I was released because Cirilo Perez bailed me out.\"\u00a0 (Pages 42-43.)<br\/><br\/>Cross-examination:\u00a0 \"I was detained by order of the municipal president until Monday evening.\u00a0 The jail was locked and was guarded by policeman Salvador Luquinario.\u00a0 I know what tuba is, but I never drink it.\u00a0 I testified in the case against Godinez on January 23.\"\u00a0 (Pages 44-45.)<br\/><br\/>Melecio Lambo, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows: \"In January I was justice of the peace in Moalboal.\u00a0 I did not order the arrest of Protasio Tramada.\u00a0 A complaint was drawn up against him and signed by the treasurer and president charging him with failure to procure a personal cedula.\u00a0 He pleaded guilty and I sentenced him.\u00a0 Then he gave bond and obtained provisional liberty so he could appear as a witness in the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 The police sergeant and the presidents\u00a0 secretary signed the bond.\u00a0 The president did not sign it.\"\u00a0 (Pages 45-46.)<br\/><br\/>Cross-examination:\u00a0 \"The president did not say anything about Protasio being intoxicated.\u00a0 When the complaint was presented to me I refused it and called the attention of the president to the fact that Protasio had been subpoenaed by the Court of First Instance, but he said; 'Receive the complaint because he was arrested; he\u00a0 can give bond.'\u00a0 He was allowed a special bond on account of having been subpoenaed; it was not an appeal bond.\"\u00a0 (Pages 47-48.)<br\/><br\/>Mariano Villareal, being duly\u00a0 sworn, testified substantially as follows; \"When I signed the complaint against Protasio Tramada on January 6, for delay in payment of his cedula tax, I did not know that he had been subpoenaed by this court.\u00a0 I was new in the town, having been transferred to that town on January 3, and was told by some person there that Protasio had not paid his cedula tax.\" (Pages 48-49.)<br\/><br\/>Cross-examination; \"I do not know who it was who presented the complaint to me to sign, as I did not know any of these people, being a stranger in the town.\u00a0 I simply looked in the record and\u00a0 saw that the party had not yet paid his tax and I immediately signed the complaint.\"\u00a0 (Pages 49-50.)<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENSE.<br\/><\/div><br\/>Enrique Jaca, the defendant, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"I am 43 years old, married, and president of the municipality of Moalboal, Cebu.\u00a0 I did not know Protasio Tramada until 9 p. m. January 5, 1913, when he came to my\u00a0 house with Vicente Villaflor.\u00a0 We went to the town hall and I served Protasio with his subpoena.\u00a0 He told me that he was tired and Vicente asked if they could not sleep in my house.\u00a0 I was afraid and told them they might sleep in the town hall without harm until the following day Protasio was intoxicated.\u00a0 I went home and left them upstairs in the town hall.\u00a0 The jail is downstairs.\u00a0 I did not deliver him to anyone, as we only had one policeman, who was then at the door of the town hall.\u00a0 On the following day the sergeant drew up the complaint against Protasio and presented it to me for approval.\u00a0 It was the sergeant who entered the complaint.\u00a0 When I signed it, it already bore the signature of the treasurer, Protasio was then sentenced, for he pleaded guilty.\u00a0 He was then permitted to go on bail so as to appear as a witness in this court.\u00a0 He was drunk Sunday night.\u00a0 I know he was at liberty Monday forenoon, as I saw him alone in the lower part of the town hall; in the afternoon he was in the public market.\u00a0 It was the sergeant's duty to feed the prisoners; he has the contract, and his wife is the one who serves them.\u00a0 It was on Tuesday after Protasio Tramada was there that the sergeant told me that his wife would not feed them because she had no money\u00a0 during that week.\u00a0 Protasio was in good condition when he left the town hall and went direct to the market.\u00a0 It would take from a day and a half to three days to walk from Moalboal to Cebu.\"\u00a0 (Pages 50-56.)<br\/><br\/>Cross-examination:\u00a0 \"I had no bad intention when I approved the complaint against Protasio, although I knew he was subpoenaed by this court.\u00a0 I only left him to sleep in the municipal building, and had no intention of keeping him a prisoner.\u00a0 I did not order his detention or turn him over to the police.\u00a0 I only told him he might stay in the building if he wished, because he\u00a0 was drunk.\u00a0 I did not notice who was on guard that night.\u00a0 Salvador Luquinario was custodian of the building.\"\u00a0 (Pages 56-58.)<br\/><br\/>Juan Buaya, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:\u00a0 \"One Sunday night I went to the house of the defendant and found him and his wife at home.\u00a0 At 9 o'clock Vicente and Protasio came and asked the date of their case.\u00a0 The defendant said it would be on the 11th, and he told them they better sign the subpoena as the mail would leave the next day, so we went to the town hall.\u00a0 Vicente Viliaflor was drunk and the other had taken a little.\u00a0 Vicente asked the president if they could sleep in his house.\u00a0 The president told them they better sleep in the town hall and see him again the following day.\u00a0 The president then left and I talked with Vicente and Protasio in the lower part of the building.\u00a0 When I left, Protasio was in the door where the guard was, and at 9 o'clock on the following day I saw Protasio at the market and asked him why he was there, and he said he was waiting for Vicente, who had gone to the mountains to get money for their expenses in Cebu.\u00a0 I saw Protasio again at 4 o'clock;

The boy was not a friend of mine, but I was sorry for him, as he was poor and had not eaten that\u00a0 day.\u00a0 He had\u00a0 been imprisoned during the entire day.\"\u00a0 (Pages 74-77.)<br\/><br\/>The accused was adjudged guilty of contempt of court as denned and\u00a0 penalized in sections 232 and 236 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and was sentenced to imprisonment for the period of thirty-five days and to pay a fine of P100, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.<br\/><br\/>In the case <i>In re<\/i> Gomez (6 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 647, 652) this court held that: \"Any person who is guilty of any improper conduct which tends directly or indirectly to impede or defeat the administration of justice is in contempt and may be punished by the courts.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar the appellant, an officer of the court below, was charged with misconduct which directly tended to impede the administration of justice therein.\u00a0 The only questions raised by appellant have to do with the sufficiency of the proof and the correctness of the findings of fact by the trial judge.\u00a0 After a careful review of all the evidence of record we are unable to say that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses testify, erred in accepting as true the statements of the witnesses called in support of the charge, and in refusing to credit the excuses and explanations offered by the accused.<br\/><br\/>We agree with the trial judge that the evidence sustains a finding that the appellant procured the arrest and detention of a witness cited to appear in the trial court on the petty charge that he was\u00a0 not furnished with a cedula; that the purpose\u00a0 of the appellant in procuring the arrest and detention of this witness at the particular time when he did so was to prevent the witness from appearing in the Court of First Instance in compliance with the subpoena which appellant well knew had been issued to secure his attendance as a witness; that whether the arrest of the witness was technically legal or not, the appellant did not procure the arrest in good faith, in the performance of any duty which he felt incumbent upon him, either as a public official or as a private citizen; that without regard to the question whether the witness finally appeared to testify in the cause in which he was subpoenaed, he was in fact prevented by the misconduct of the appellant from appearing at the time set in the subpoena; and that\u00a0 the appellant was guilty of a contempt in that his misconduct both directly and indirectly tended to impede the administration of justice.<br\/><br\/>It is hardly necessary for us to add that our ruling in this case should not be construed as sustaining the proposition that witnesses subpoenaed in the courts are not liable to arrest for offenses with which they may be charged.\u00a0 The ground upon which we base our ruling in this case is that, accepting the findings of fact by the trial judge, the evidence clearly discloses that the appellant procured the arrest of the witness in bad faith; that his real object in having the witness arrested and detained at that time was to prevent the attendance of the witness at the trial of appellant's friend and politicalally; and that the making of the arrest at that time, and without awaiting the termination of his duties as a witness, was not necessary in the due administration of justice in his case, nor required in the interest of the public.<br\/><br\/>It is the undoubted right of every tribunal entrusted with the determination of questions of fact to compel the attendance of witnesses and to hold and control them until the purposes of their\u00a0 attendance are fully accomplished.\u00a0 This power is absolutely indispensable to the proper discharge of their functions.\u00a0 The privilege of parties to judicial proceedings as well as others required to attend upon them of going to places where they are held, and remaining so long as is necessary, and returning wholly free from the restraint of process in other civil proceedings, has been generally recognized and favorably enforced in the United States.\u00a0 This privilege does not ordinarily extend to criminal cases so as to render a witness immune from arrest on a criminal charge.\u00a0 But the\u00a0 principle on which it rests sustains the proposition that one who procures the arrest of a witness in attendance upon a court of justice upon a frivolous, fictitious, or false charge, with the object and for the purpose of preventing his attendance upon court, or one who for a like purpose procures the arrest and detention of a witness under circumstances which clearly disclose that the making of the arrest while the witness was in attendance on court and without awaiting the termination of his duties as a witness was not necessary in the due administration of justice nor required in the interests of the public, is undoubtedly guilty of a contempt, in that such misconduct tends to impede the administration of justice.\u00a0 If, under such circumstances, the courts cannot protect those who appear before them to testify, their power is not adequate to the full discharge of the duties with which they are charged.\u00a0 (See reporter's note to the case of <i>In re<\/i> Healey, 53 Vt, 694; 38 Am. Rep., 717.)<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial court should be and are hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The lower court erred in finding the herein defendant-appellant guilty of the crime charged.\"<\/blockquote>These two assignments of error, we think, may well be considered together.\u00a0 They present the question whether or not, under the facts adduced during the trial of the cause, the defendant is guilty of the crime charged in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The offense with which the defendant is charged falls under article 491 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 Said article provides a punishment for any private person who shall enter the dwelling house of another against the latter's will.\u00a0 In order that the alleged offense shall fall under said article, the offender must (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">a<\/span>) be a private person; (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">b<\/span>) enter the house of another; and (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">c<\/span>) enter the house of another against the latter's will.\u00a0 In the present case the defendant was a private person and it is admitted that he entered the house of another.\u00a0 The only question that remains is did he enter the house of another against the\u00a0 other's will.\u00a0 An examination of the evidence adduced\u00a0 during the trial of the cause discloses:<br\/><br\/>That on the night of the 18th day of September, 1912, at about 9 o'clock, Inocencia Guillan and her son were in their house alone; her husband being absent; that at about 9 o'clock <i>she closed the door leading into her house<\/i> and with her son went into her room and retired for the night; that soon thereafter she was awakened by the calls of her sister and the voice of the defendant, who was then and there in her house, making inquiries for one Maria; that a conversation immediately ensued between the defendant, Inocencia Guillan, and her sister about the said Maria, which conversation soon resulted in a quarrel, during which the defendant struck the sister of Inocencia with a stick or cane. Evidently much more occurred in the house at that particular time than has been put in the record, for the reason that it appears that because of what had occurred in the house two policemen appeared upon the scene, as well as many of the neighbors.\u00a0 From what is said by the parties interested, in their declarations, there seems to have been no reason for arousing the attention of the police nor the curiosity of the neighbors.\u00a0 However, without reference to said quarrel and the things which occurred which attracted the attention of the police and the curiosity of the neighbors, we believe that the following facts were proved beyond a reasonable doubt:<br\/><ol><li>That on the night of the 18th day of September, 1912, Inocencia\u00a0 Guillan closed the door leading into her house at about 9 o'clock p. m. and with her young son retired to her room and her bed for the night; that her husband was not at home at that time; that she closed the door for fear that some one might enter her house.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That the defendant, after the door had been closed in the manner and for the reasons stated, without the knowledge or consent of the owner, entered the house of Inocencia druillan.<\/li><\/ol>The question remaining is:\u00a0 Did the defendant enter said house against the will of the owner?<br\/><br\/>In the case of United\u00a0 States <i>vs<\/i>.

and (2) if the first question be answered in the negative, does\u00a0 section 621 of the Revised Ordinances of the city of Manila prohibit the keeping or maintaining of any table or other instrument or device for the purpose of playing other games than gambling games?\u00a0 The two questions will be considered together.<br\/><br\/>The ordinance in question reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 621.\u00a0 <i>Gambling devices, maintenance of<\/i>.\u2014No person shall set up, keep, or maintain, or permit to be set up, kept, or maintained, on any premises occupied or controlled by him, any table or other instrument or device for the purpose of gaming or gambling, or with which money, liquor, or anything of value shall in any manner be played for.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 622.\u00a0 <i>Gambling devices, possession, etc., of<\/i>.\u2014No person shall bring into the city, expose in a street or public place, or have in his possession for the purpose of gaming or gambling any table, instrument, or device of any kind whereon or with which money or other thing of value may in any manner be played for.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 623.\u00a0 <i>Frequenting, or acting as banker, etc., of gambling house.<\/i>\u2014No person shall frequent, visit, become an inmate of, solicit, run, or act as banker, dealer, agent, or doorkeeper for any house, store, hall, clubroom, or other place where\u00a0 any game of chance is conducted, or where is kept any table, instrument, or device of any kind used for gaming or gambling whereon or with which money or other thing of value may in any manner be played for.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 624.\u00a0 <i>Penalty;

penalty<\/i>.\u2014No person shall play or engage in faro, roulette, or any other device or game of chance or hazard in which money or other thing of value is in any manner played for, under a penalty of not more than two hundred pesos, for each offense.\"<\/blockquote>At the time of the enactment of this municipal legislation, the general law on the subject was to be found in the Penal Code, Book 2, Title 6, and articles 529 and 579, and Book 4, Title 12, Chap. 3, of the Civil Code.\u00a0 Under these provisions a clear distinction was made between gambling and betting; gambling referring only to games of luck, chance, or hazard, while betting was allowed on any other game, the only penalty being in case\u00a0 the loser lost more than he could afford to lose.\u00a0 By\u00a0 Act No. 1757 of the Philippine Commission, gambling is defined to include the playing at or the betting upon games the result in which depends wholly or chiefly upon chance.\u00a0 Gambling is, therefore, no longer restricted to games of chance, luck or hazard, but may include those in which some element of skill affects the result.\u00a0 But although the definition of gambling is thus somewhat enlarged by Act No. 1757, it has remained materially the same in that games depending wholly or chiefly upon <i>skill<\/i> are excluded.\u00a0 That \"gambling\" under these statutes has a limited and restricted sense not coterminous with the generally accepted sense of the term must be conceded.<br\/><blockquote>\"Any contest or course of action commenced and prosecuted in consequence of a bet or wager, and with a view to determine the bet\u00a0 or wager upon the event of such contest or course of action, is gaming.\u00a0 To constitute gaming there must not only be a betting upon the termination of an event, but the course of action to bring about such event must have been originated with a view to determine the bet.\"\u00a0 (Words and Phrases, Vol. ,4, p. 3024,\u00a0 Title, Gambling-Gaming.\u00a0 See also other definitions thereunder.)<\/blockquote>In this jurisdiction, therefore, gambling has a limited, statutory definition which excludes some forms of betting.\u00a0 Comparing the provisions of the Spanish Codes with Act No. 1757, it is concluded that the statutory definition of gambling has been practically the same during the whole time that the city of Manila has had a corporate existence under Act No. 183, with the exception noted.<br\/><br\/>That the municipal board of that city had before it the provisions of the general law, on the subject of gambling at the time section 621 <i>et seq<\/i>. of the Revised Ordinances were passed must be presumed.\u00a0 These sections were passed by the municipal board without attempting to make any distinction between gambling in its statutory sense in this jurisdiction and its broad, commonly accepted meaning.\u00a0 The provisions of the Penal Code in respect to\u00a0 gambling were construed by the supreme court of Spain in a decision published on December 28, 1887. (U. S, <i>vs.<\/i> Reyes, 3 Phil. Rep.,\u00a0 611.)<br\/><blockquote>\"Where words have been long used in a technical sense and have been judicially construed to have a certain meaning prior to a particular statute in which they\u00a0 are used, the rule of construction requires that the words used in such statute should be construed according to the sense in which they have been so previously used, although that sense may vary from the strict, literal meaning of the words.\"\u00a0 (Sutherland, Stat Const., \u00a7 255.)<\/blockquote>In section 621, although the phrase \"gambling devices\" appears in the heading and also in the text of the section, no attempt is made to make it more comprehensive than its statutory signification.\u00a0 Again, in section 622, which prohibits the <i>possession<\/i> of gambling devices, no attempt is made to use the words in other than\u00a0 their statutory sense, and the arrangement of the text is a still stronger indication that only gambling in its statutory sense is considered, as it prohibits <i>for the purpose of gaming or gambling<\/i> any table, instrument, etc.\u00a0 Section 623 refers to \"gambling houses\" and to \"games of chance\" without qualifying these expressions.\u00a0 Section 624, which provides the penalty for the violation of the three preceding sections, provides for the confiscation of \"every table, instrument or other device used, set up, kept, or maintained <i>for the purpose of gaming or gambling\"<\/i> And section 625 prohibits the playing of faro, roulette, or any other device or game of chance or hazard.\u00a0 Under the most liberal construction of section 625, it cannot be said to include other than games <i>of chance or hazard<\/i>.\u00a0 It first names two games of the prohibited class\u2014faro and roulette\u2014and then provides, \"or any other device or game of chance or hazard.\"\u00a0 If the section merely stated \"or any other device or game,\" there is abundant authority for construing the prohibition to include only games <i>ejusdem generis<\/i> to faro and roulette.\u00a0 But with the addition of the phrase \"of chance or hazard\" the prohibition is restricted beyond the possibility of argument to games of that class.\u00a0 Referring again to the preceding Sections, it certainly appears inconsistent and improbable that the board would have penalized the possession or maintenance of instruments or devices which were used for playing games not depending upon chance or hazard, and at the same time provide no penalty for the actual participants of such games.\u00a0 Reading all these sections together in the light of the general law on the subject, it seems clear that only games of chance were being prohibited.\u00a0 The enlarged definition of gambling under Act No. 1757 to include those games the result of which depends chiefly upon chance can in no wise affect the questions under consideration.<br\/><br\/>This distinction between games of chance and games of skill, making betting upon the former illegal, is quite well treated in State <i>vs<\/i>. Gupton (30 N. C, 271), where a game of tenpins was held not to be a game of chance, but a game depending chiefly upon the skill of the players, and betting thereon consequently not prohibited by a statute prohibiting bets or wagers upon games of chance.<br\/><br\/>Nor is it unknown in other jurisdictions.\u00a0 In State <i>vs<\/i>. Quaid (43 La., 1076), the defendant was indicted under a city ordinance\u00a0 prohibiting \"gambling with\u00a0 dice, cards, or other means\" or \"keeping a banking game or gambling house,\" for maintaining a game of pin pool on his premises.\u00a0 It was held that this game was exclusively a game of skill, and a conviction under the ordinance in question for that reason illegal.<br\/><br\/>In Ridgeway <i>vs<\/i>. Farndale (2 Q. B. (1892), 309), where the\u00a0 sufficiency of the complaint was under consideration, the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The original offense, as described by the Vagrancy Act, 1824 (5 Geo. 4, c. 83), s. 4, was 'playing or\u00a0 betting in any street, road, highway, or other open and public place, at or with any table or\u00a0 instrument of gaming, at any game or pretended game of chance.'\u00a0 The Act of 1873 (36 &amp; 37 Viet., c.\u00a0 38), s. 3, contains a similar provision, with the addition of the words 'or any coin, card, token, or other article used as an instrument or means of such wagering or gaming;' but in that Act the words 'at any game or pretended game of chance' remain a part of the essential definition of the offense.\u00a0 In the present case those words are omitted from the information, and the magistrate has come to no finding on an essential part of the case, namely, that the appellant was wagering or gaming at a game or pretended game of chance.\u00a0 The conviction is invalid on the face of it, and must be quashed.\"<\/blockquote>See also State <i>vs<\/i>. Grimes (49 Minn., 443).<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, this court has already\u00a0 construed section 621 of the Revised Ordinances.\u00a0 In United States <i>vs<\/i>. Chan-Cun-Chay (5 Phil. Rep., 385), it is said:<br\/><blockquote>\"An examination of the provisions of the said ordinance in connection with the provisions of said article (343) of the Penal Code will disclose the fact that the said ordinance provides for the punishment of a different offense than that provided for by\u00a0 the said article of the Penal Code.\u00a0 The ordinance punishes a person who shall set up, keep, or maintain, etc., on any premises\u00a0 occupied or controlled by him, instruments for the purpose of gaming or gambling, etc., which may be used for gambling for anything of value.\u00a0 It will be seen that under this ordinance these things need not be used for gambling, whereas article 343 of the Penal Code punishes bankers and proprietors of houses where games of chance, stakes, or hazard <i>are played<\/i>.\u00a0 The ordinance punishes the maintenance of a house in which are kept gambling paraphernalia, while the Penal Code punishes the maintenance of a house where games of chance are actually played.\u00a0 Therefore the ordinance punishes a different offense from that provided for by the Penal Code in said article.\"<\/blockquote>It is therefore clear that the Municipal Board, in enacting section 621 <i>et seq<\/i>. was only dealing with the subject of gambling in its statutory sense, and paraphernalia used for that purpose, and did not prohibit the playing of games or the betting thereon, or the possession of paraphernalia used in playing thereof, the result of which does not depend wholly or chiefly upon chance.\u00a0 The result is that, unless the complaint alleges that the defendant was maintaining gambling devices on his premises, it does not allege facts sufficient to constitute a public offense.<br\/><br\/>The complaint alleges that the defendant voluntarily and illegally permitted the playing of a game called <i>nones y pares<\/i> for money and other things of value upon his premises in violation of section 621 of the Revised Ordinances of the city of Manila.\u00a0 It is nowhere alleged that <i>nones y pares<\/i> is a gambling game, nor can this be inferred from the allegations in the complaint.\u00a0 It therefore follows that the allegations in the complaint do not constitute a public offense.\u00a0 In reaching this conclusion, we have found it unnecessary to decide whether or not the Municipal Board is empowered to prohibit by municipal legislation the playing at or the betting or wagering upon games which are not gambling, but which might be in the opinion of the board detrimental to the\u00a0 welfare of the city.\u00a0 Neither have we found it necessary to decide at this time whether, in view of the provisions of Act No. 1757, a municipality can, by ordinance, penalize\u00a0 gambling.\u00a0 The only questions involved in this case, and Which we have decided, are:\u00a0 (1) That section 621 <i>et seq<\/i>. of the Revised Ordinances deal with matters relating to gambling only; and (2) that the complaint\u00a0 does not allege that <i>nones y pares<\/i> is a gambling game.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

CARSON TAYLOR ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">In this case the defendant and appellant Taylor made a conditional sale of some chattels to one Tuohy under a written contract dated January\u00a0 26, 1911.\u00a0 The contract price was P750.\u00a0 After acknowledging receipt of a payment of P150, the contract provides that the balance of P600 should be \"paid within four months from date hereof, i.e., on or before the 25th day of May, 1911.\"\u00a0 The contract further provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is further agreed that the title to the property above described shall remain in the party of the first part until the full payment of the said purchase price.\"<\/blockquote>From the stipulation of facts entered into by the parties, and upon\u00a0 which the case was submitted to the court, it appears that the\u00a0 property was levied upon by the plaintiff in the case at bar, E. C. McCullough &amp; Co., as the judgment creditor of Tuohy, at which time the sum of P650\u00a0 only had been paid Taylor.\u00a0 Taylor claimed the property, and as McCullough &amp; Co. refused to file a bond with the sheriff, the levy was discharged.\u00a0 Later, however, McCullough &amp; Co., under the same execution, levied upon all the rights of Tuohy in the property.\u00a0 The sheriff sold Tuohy's rights in the property at public auction, they being purchased by his judgment creditor, the plaintiff in the present case, for the sum of P26.\u00a0 The latter thereupon tendered Taylor the P100 still due him upon the purchase price and demanded the delivery of the property, Taylor refusing to accept the one and make the other.<br\/><br\/>The defendant relies in this instance upon the proposition that Tuohy acquired the property under a conditional sale, and that as he failed to comply with the requirements of the contract by not paying the full amount of the purchase price \"on or before the 25th day of May, 1911,\" his rights to the property were extinguished; in other words, that Tuohy's rights to the property were forfeited by his failure to comply with this condition.<br\/><br\/>An inspection of the contract does not disclose an express stipulation that the property was to revert to the vendor and that payments already made were to be forfeited upon the vendee's failure to make final payment on or before the specified date.\u00a0 We see nothing in it which would prevent the vendor from suing for the remainder of the purchase price had he so desired and obviously, the vendor could not do this and at the same time demand the return of the goods together with the forfeiture of the payments already made.\u00a0 It might be true that he could have demanded possession of the goods had he so desired after the failure of the vendee to complete payment for the property on or before May 25.\u00a0 As to whether an accompanying demand for the forfeiture of the payments already made would have been sustained does not necessarily arise in this case.\u00a0 But the trend of the cases seems to be that a forfeiture clause must be sufficiently set forth in the contract so that the intention of the parties to that effect is not in doubt.<br\/><blockquote>\"A <i>lex commissoria<\/i> is never presumed: that is to say, unless it is agreed when the contract is made that it shall be voidable at the vendor's option unless the purchase money is paid by a day fixed, the vendor cannot treat it, on default in payment, as no longer binding; he can only sue for the money and for damages' (Moyle's Contract of Sale in the Civil Law, p. 173,)<\/blockquote>In Carpenter <i>vs<\/i>. Blandford (8 B. &amp; C, 575,108 Eng. Rep., 1156) it was said:\u00a0 \"The defendant in this\u00a0 case insists on a forfeiture, which is <i>strictissimi juris<\/i>.\"<br\/><br\/>And in Irish <i>vs<\/i>. Lundin (28 Neb., 84) it is said that forfeitures are odious in law, and are never presumed or enforced except when, clearly and unmistakably expressed.<br\/><br\/>But assuming, without deciding, that the\u00a0 parties desired and that the contract contains a forfeiture clause, it was waived by the defendant's failure to enforce it at the proper time.\u00a0 The contract was executed on January 25, 1911, at which time only P150 of the purchase price had been paid.\u00a0 When the other P500 was paid does not appear; but we cannot presume that all installments of it were paid before May 25.\u00a0 Indeed, since the vendee still had possession of the property so late as September 6, 1911 (as we shall see), the inference would be the other way.\u00a0 These facts of continued possession and the acceptance of payments up to within two-fifteenths of the purchase price lead to no other conclusion than that the parties had disregarded for the time being the condition that the full purchase price must be paid on or before May 25, 1911, and that they were acting under the last clause\u00a0 above quoted; that the vendor still recognized in the vendee the right to make final payment and perfect his title, and that he did not regard the clause above referred to as having extinguished all rights of the vendee to the property on May 25.\u00a0 In speaking of conditional sales containing a forfeiture clause, Mechem on Sales, section 609, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The law has no interests of its own to subserve in insisting upon forfeitures or the other results\u00a0 of default.\u00a0 The remedies it gives are for the benefit of the vendor, and he may waive them if he will.\u00a0 He may do this, moreover, either expressly or by implication, and as the results of default more often work hardship to the buyer than to the seller, the law looks with complacence at least upon those acts of the vendor which may fairly be construed as indicative of his intention not to insist upon a forfeiture of the buyer's rights.\u00a0 If, therefore, the seller, notwithstanding the default, does not avail himself of his appropriate remedy, but so acts as to reasonably warrant the inference that he regards the buyer's right as still subsisting, he will be deemed to have waived the default, and he will not be at liberty to declare a forfeiture until he has in some way put the buyer, whom he has thus misled, in the attitude of a fresh default.\"<\/blockquote>Our examination of the cases upon this point leads us to believe that the learned author has very fairly stated the law.<br\/><br\/>In Mosby <i>vs<\/i>. Goff (21 R. I., 494), the court, citing several cases, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The cases proceed on the\u00a0 principle that where, on a conditional sale of a chattel, it is agreed\u00a0 that the vendee is to have possession and pay the price within a fixed time, and after the purchase money has become due and remains unpaid, the vendee is permitted to retain possession, and the vendor receives part payment, such receipt is an assent of the vendor to delay, a waiver of any forfeiture, and a recognition of the right of the vendee to acquire title by payment of the residue of the purchase money; and that this right continues until a demand for such payment by the vendor and a neglect or refusal of the vendee to comply with the demand.\"<\/blockquote>We are clearly of the opinion that, even assuming a forfeiture clause in the present case, it was waived by the vendor at the time he had a right to enforce it.\u00a0 A subsequent desire on his part to enforce the forfeiture is a question of evidence and can best be answered by an examination of the record.<br\/><br\/>At the time the first levy was made, September 1, 1911, the property was in the possession of Tuohy in the De la Rama Building.\u00a0 At the time of the second levy, September 6, 1911, the property was still in the De la Rama Building, \"<i>where it was at the time the first levy was made.<\/i>\"\u00a0 At the time this action was brought, the property was in the possession of the defendant Taylor.\u00a0 These facts are taken from the stipulation of the parties above referred to.\u00a0 This stipulation was assented to by both parties, and it must be presumed that an attempt was made to set forth the real facts of the case.\u00a0 Had Taylor taken actual possession of the property between the time of the first and second levy, why was the distinction made that on September 6 the property was still in the De la Rama Building where it was at the time the first levy was made, while it is further stated that at the time this action was brought the property was in the possession of the defendant Taylor?\u00a0 It would be a most strained construction of this instrument to conclude that the one statement was equivalent to the\u00a0 other, especially in view of the fact that it is clearly stated that only five days previous to the second levy the property was in the possession of the vendee, and the further fact that it had not been moved from the place where he kept it.\u00a0 It does not appear that the defendant Taylor exercised any act of ownership or asserted any right of possession to the property until after the vendee's interest had been levied upon by the sheriff on September 6, 1911.\u00a0 It is true that upon the levy of September 1 being made he claimed the property as owner, but it is conceded that he had claimed as\u00a0 owner, i. e., claimed to have legal title, all the time.\u00a0 We therefore hold that the property in question was still in the possession of Tuohy when his interest in it was sold by the sheriff.<br\/><br\/>Was the interest which Tuohy had in the property capable of being sold at an execution sale?\u00a0 There is a clear distinction between <i>the sale of property itself<\/i>, where title remains in the vendor until payment of the purchase price, and the sale of the <i>interest of the vendee<\/i> in such property.\u00a0 None of the cases cited by the appellant refer to the latter proposition.\u00a0 Section 450 of our Code of Civil Procedure expressly authorizes the sale upon\u00a0 execution of \"any interest\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 of the judgment debtor.\"\u00a0 This section has recently been construed by this court as follows;<br\/><blockquote>\"This statute authorizes the sale under execution of every kind of property, and every interest in property which is, or may be, the subject of private ownership and transfer.\u00a0 It deals with equitable rights and interests as it deals with legal, without anywhere expressly recognizing or making any distinction between them.\"\u00a0 (Reyes <i>vs<\/i>. Grey, 21 Phil. Rep., 73.)<\/blockquote>At the close of its decision the lower court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"As to the equities of the case, we are not sure that it is less equitable to give plaintiff the benefit of his purchase, even for the small consideration\u00a0 paid, than it would be to construe the\u00a0 instrument as effecting a forfeiture of the vendee's rights after he had paid all but two-fifteenths of the purchase price.\u00a0 If the price\u00a0 paid at the execution sale was small the fault was not\u00a0 plaintiff's.\u00a0 All of the defendants had an equal right to participate at that sale and raise plaintiff's bid if they saw fit.\u00a0 Having failed to do so, they are hardly in a position to complain of the result.\"<\/blockquote>The judgment of the lower court, ordering the delivery of the property to the plaintiff upon its payment to the defendant of the sum of P100, is affirmed with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres<\/i> and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">MORELAND, J.,<\/span> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">concurring:<\/span><br\/><br\/>I agree to the decision except in so far as it deals with the subject of forfeitures.\u00a0 As to that question I reserve my judgment. <\/div>",

Santos as sheriff of the Province of Rizal, acting by virtue of an execution issued at the instance of Kuenzle &amp; Streiff in a case wherein the latter was the plaintiff and George Cruickshank was the defendant.\u00a0 The plaintiff, who was in possession of the property at the time of the seizure, demanded its return from the sheriff.\u00a0 Upon the sheriff's refusal to comply with\u00a0 this demand the plaintiff instituted this action in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila to recover possession of the\u00a0 property seized and for damages caused by reason of the seizure.\u00a0 The first complaint\u00a0 was against Lope K.\u00a0 Santos alone and a summons was served upon him on the 10th day of April.\u00a0 The amended complaint added the firm of Kuenzle &amp; Streiff as\u00a0 defendant.\u00a0 This amended complaint was served upon the manager of the defendant Kuenzle &amp; Streiff on the 24th day of\u00a0 April, and upon the defendant Santos on the 25th day of April.\u00a0 Both defendants entered their appearance through their attorneys, on the 4th day of May, and not having answered within the time provided, Lope K. Santos was, by a judgment of the court, declared to be in default on the 23d of May, and the case was heard on the 25th of May, at which time the defendant Kuenzle &amp; Streiff was declared to be in default.\u00a0 After stating the facts as found, the trial court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Let judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff, Sydney Coombs, and against the defendants Lope K. Santos, sheriff of the Province of Rizal, and Kuenzle &amp; Streiff, for the delivery and possession of the following described\u00a0 property:\u00a0 A temporary building of\u00a0 mixed materials; 1 piano; 49 bamboo chairs; 26 bar tables; 100 rattan chairs; 1 piano stool; 1 refrigerator; 1 front bar; 1 back bar; 1 cork extractor; 1 set of mirrors; one 50 c. p. electric light globe; seven 16 c. p. electric light globes; six 100 c. p. electric light globes; two 400 c. p, electric light globes; five 50 c. p. electric light globes; one 32 c. p. electric light globe; and for damages for the detention thereof in the sum of P200\u00a0 per month during the time it was detained, and for the costs of the cause.\"<\/blockquote>From this judgment Lope K. Santos alone appealed and now insists that the trial court erred (1) in overruling his motion asking for the annulment of the order wherein he was declared to be in default; and (2) in taking jurisdiction of the cause, the same being for the recovery of real property.\u00a0 No other questions have been raised by the appellant.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the first alleged error, it appears, as before stated, that the amended complaint was served upon the appellant on the 25th day of April, 1911, and that he entered his appearance on\u00a0 the 4th of May.\u00a0 On the 23d day of May, the appellant not having answered or demurred, a default judgment was entered against him.\u00a0 Subsequently thereto, and on the following day, he filed a motion, which was sworn to, asking that the judgment by default be set aside.\u00a0 This motion was denied and exception noted.\u00a0 The reasons given by counsel for the appellant in the motion to set aside the default judgment were as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is the docket clerk of the office who has in his care the papers in cases pending, and whose duty it is to notify counsel of\u00a0 the dates when the time expires for answering or presenting any\u00a0 other pleadings to the courts.\u00a0 Said docket clerk has been absent\u00a0 from this office since May 6 without notifying anyone and without leaving any memorandum of hearings\u00a0 or motions pending, and returned only yesterday.\u00a0 Counsel who are now in this office received no notification of the time having elapsed for presenting an answer or demurrer until they were served by the court with notice of the order of default against said defendant, Lope K. Santos.\"<\/blockquote>Counsel for appellee insist that the first alleged error is not well founded because (1) the motion does not show that the default occurred through\u00a0 mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) it was not shown that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to set aside the default judgment; and (3) the application to open the default does not contain nor was accompanied by an affidavit showing a meritorious defense.\u00a0 The first and second propositions will be considered together.<br\/><br\/>Section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"Upon such terms as may be just the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a judgment, order, or other proceeding taken against\u00a0 him through his mistake, inadvertence,\u00a0 surprise or excusable neglect:\u00a0 <i>Provided<\/i>, That application therefor be made within a reasonable time, but in no case exceeding six months after such judgment, order, or proceeding was taken.\"<\/blockquote>The default was entered\" nineteen days after the appellant had entered his appearance.\u00a0 Motion to open default was made before the trial of the case on the merits.\u00a0 No one contends that if the default had been\u00a0 set aside it would have delayed the trial of the cause or inconvenienced the appellee in any manner.\u00a0 Counsel who entered their appearance for the appellant now swear that they have in their office an employee called the docket clerk, who has in his possession the papers in pending cases, and whose duty it is to notify counsel of the days within which pleadings must be filed.\u00a0 This docket clerk absented himself on May\u00a0 6, two days after appearance was entered, and did not return until the 23d, the very day that the default was taken.\u00a0 The clerk did not notify counsel of the expiration of the time within which they should file their answer.\u00a0 Do these facts bring them within the provisions of section 113, <i>supra<\/i>?<br\/><br\/>A default judgment does not pretend to be based upon the merits of the controversy.\u00a0 Its existence is justified on the ground that it is the one final expedient to induce the defendant to join issue\u00a0 upon the allegations tendered by the plaintiff, and to do so without unnecessary delay.\u00a0 A judgment by default may amount to a positive and considerable injustice to the defendant? and the possibility of such serious consequences necessitates a careful examination of the grounds upon which the defendant asks that it be set aside.<br\/><br\/>In Watson <i>vs<\/i>. R. R. Co. (41 Cal., 17, 20), the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Applications of this character are addressed to the discretion\u2014the legal discretion\u2014of the court in which the default has occurred, and should be disposed of by it as substantial justice may seem to\u00a0 require.\u00a0 Each case must be determined upon its own peculiar facts, for perhaps no two cases will be found to present the same circumstances for consideration.\u00a0 As a general rule, however, in cases where, as here, the application is made so immediately after default entered as that no considerable delay to the plaintiff is to be occasioned by permitting a defense on the merits, the court ought to incline to relieve.\u00a0 The exercise of the mere discretion of the court ought to tend in a reasonable degree, at least, to bring about a judgment on the very merits of the case; and when the circumstances are such as to lead the court to hesitate upon the motion to open the default, it is better, as a general rule, that the doubt should be resolved in favor of the application.\"<\/blockquote>It might be added that if plaintiff relies upon his judgment obtained by default and directs the\u00a0 attention of the court to no real injury which would result to his interests by the reopening of the case, his objection to such action assumes, to say the least, the appearance of a\u00a0 technicality, which, in this liberal age, is not looked upon with favor.\u00a0 An examination of the authorities shows that where application to set aside a default judgment is made immediately following its entry, it will receive much greater consideration than where a\u00a0 delay of months or even\u00a0 weeks\u00a0 has occurred.<br\/><br\/>But it is urged that the granting of the motion to set aside\u00a0 a default rests in the discretion of the court; that such discretion cannot be controlled in the absence of a showing of an abuse thereof; and that this showing has not been made in the case at bar.<br\/><br\/>It must be remembered that the only discretion conferred upon officers is a legal discretion, and when anything is left to any officer to be done according to his discretion the law intends it to be done with a sound discretion and according to law; and if a given case falls within both the letter and spirit of section 113, <i>supra<\/i>, a denial of the relief sought will amount to an abuse of such discretion.<br\/><br\/>\"Inadvertence\" is defined to be, among other things, an oversight; an involuntary accident; the effect of inattention.\u00a0 And \"mistake\" is defined to be air error in action; a blunder.\u00a0 The conduct of counsel in the case at bar in depending upon their docket clerk to\u00a0 call their attention to the time within which they must file their answer rises no higher than the plane of inadvertence.\u00a0 They have brought this case, in so far as the two propositions under consideration are concerned, within both the letter and the spirit of the remedy.<br\/><br\/>There is, however, a serious drawback\u00a0 to granting the relief asked.\u00a0 The motion asking that the default judgment be set aside is accompanied by no affidavit of merits.\u00a0 Although the Code does not specifically require such an affidavit of merits, the reasonableness and necessity for it is apparent.\u00a0 If the defendant has no\u00a0 real defense to the action or intends to enter only a technical plea, there would be no justice in permitting the case to be reopened and subject plaintiff to further delay and expense for the mere purpose of rendering a judgment in the regular manner.\u00a0 It is but right, therefore, to require the defendant to show that if he be allowed to answer he will be\u00a0 able to produce evidence which may affect the claims\u00a0 of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0 universality of the rule is attested by the remarks in 23 Cyc, 951, 955, and 962, supported by a host of authorities.\u00a0 Black\u00a0 on Judgments, \u00a7 347, thus states the general rule:<br\/><blockquote>\"Where an application is made to open a judgment, under the statutes for that purpose, it must he accompanied by an affidavit setting forth a good defense on the merits, and showing that the default occurred through\u00a0 mistake, surprise, or other statutory ground, and stating the facts constituting such mistake, surprise, etc., and also showing due diligence.\u00a0 And independently of such statutes, it has always\u00a0 been the practice of our courts, from the\u00a0 very earliest times, on an application to open or set aside a judgment, to require some sort of showing, by affidavit or otherwise, that the judgment is unjust as it stands and prejudicial to the party complaining and that he has a meritorious defense.\u00a0 It\u00a0 may therefore be regarded as a universal requirement.\"<\/blockquote>A mere statement that defendant has a valid defense is a conclusion of law (Roberts <i>vs<\/i>. Corby, 86 111., 182); or is not sufficient (Palmer <i>vs<\/i>. Rogers, 70 la., 381, 30 N. W. 645; Jackson <i>vs<\/i>. Stiles, 3 Caines (N. Y.),\u00a0 93;\u00a0 Mayer <i>vs<\/i>. Mayer, 27 Ore., 133, 39 Pac, 1002; Foster <i>vs<\/i>.

Hurd, judge, sentencing him to the penalty of two months and one day of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>, to pay a fine of 325 <i>pesetas<\/i>, with subsidiary imprisonment not to exceed one-third of the principal penalty in case of insolvency, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>Early in the morning of October 6, 1911, and on an occasion when Braulio Calang, the husband of Epifania Cupo, was absent from home\u00a0 and she was asleep with her young child in her arms, the defendant entered their house, situated in Surigao, by cutting the fastenings of the door, approached the sleeping woman and raised her skirt; whereupon Epifania awoke, immediately resisted, arose, and raised a disturbance which awakened Sinforoso Dinulus, a brother-in-law of her husband, and who, at the latter's request, was sleeping in the house.\u00a0 Although Epifania and Sinforoso pursued the intruder, whom they knew to be the defendant, they did\u00a0 not succeed in catching him.\u00a0 Therefore, oil the 11th of the same month, the said Braulio Calang, after being informed of the occurrence, reported the facts to the justice of the peace of Surigao.<br\/><br\/>The proper preliminary investigation was made and the provincial fiscal filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Surigao, charging Basilio Ticson with the crime of forcible entry of a dwelling.\u00a0 This case being thus initiated, the court, upon the evidence adduced, rendered the judgment aforementioned.<br\/><br\/>It was proved at trial that the defendant, Basilio Ticson, early in the morning of October 6, 1911, entered the house of Braulio Calang, situated in the barrio of Sison, of the pueblo of Surigao,\u00a0 by taking advantage of an occasion when the latter was away from\u00a0 home and his wife, Epifania Cupo, and brother-in-law, Sinforoso Dinulus, were asleep; that the latter, at the husband's request, had, since the previous evening, remained in the house to sleep there in order to accompany the offended party who was alone; that the defendant cut the fastenings which held the door closed, entered the room where the said Epifania was asleep, raised the skirt she was wearing, undoubtedly with the purpose of lying with\u00a0 her; that thereupon the woman awoke, immediately resisted the assault and called for help, for which reason the defendant left the house, through the same door by which he had entered, pursued by the offended party and her companion, Dinulus, who had been awakened by the noise; that both the latter recognized the defendant, for there was bright moonlight\u00a0 and they had known him previously, as he had visited at the house the night before; and that for these reasons the offended party recognized the defendant, although he was running, and even threw a piece of wood at him when he passed by the house near one of the windows.<br\/><br\/>On the fourth day after the assault, when the husband returned home and was informed of what had occurred, he immediately reported the matter to the justice of the peace, Eusebio Tiongko.\u00a0 This official testified that at the preliminary investigation the defendant confessed his guilt, and, in the presence of the justice, begged the offended spouses pardon, but that the woman refused, saying that he might attempt to repeat the act.<br\/><br\/>The criminal purpose of the defendant was to lie with the offended party, a married woman, even though he had to use violence, yet, on account of her resistance, the crime did not exceed an attempt; but, in view of the fact that in the information he was only charged with the crime of forcible entry of a dwelling, for which he was afterwards tried and convicted, we must abide by that denomination of the crime.<br\/><br\/>So, on this theory, since the defendant, in entering the house of the offended parties, had to cut the fastenings which held its door closed, he undeniably committed the crime of forcible entry, with violence and against the will of the inmates of the dwelling, inasmuch as it was not proved that he entered the place at their invitation or with their consent, it being presumed that he did so against their will, for, to gain entry, he had to cut the fastenings that held the door of the house.<br\/><br\/>Since the inhabitants of the house, before retiring for the night, securely closed the doors and windows of their dwelling, it is unquestionable that by so doing they intimated that they did\u00a0 not wish anyone to enter the dwelling without their express consent; furthermore, it is incredible that the offended party consented to and permitted the defendant's entry into her house in order that he might, with complete safety, commit an attempt against her honor.<br\/><br\/>The crime of forcible entry having been committed with violence, against the will of the offended party, it naturally follows that the provisions of\u00a0 paragraph 2 of article 491 of the Penal Code are applicable thereto, which prescribe the penalty of <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its medium and maximum degrees and a fine.<br\/><br\/>The defendant pleaded not guilty, but notwithstanding his denial and unsupported defense, which was disproved by the prosecution, the record discloses conclusive proof which produces in the mind, beyond all doubt, full conviction of his guilt as the sole perpetrator by direct participation of the crime charged, in the\u00a0 commission of which concurred neither extenuating nor aggravating circumstances.\u00a0 Therefore the penalty prescribed by law must be imposed in its medium degree.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the findings of the\u00a0 trial court by the defendant's counsel are refuted, we hereby reverse the judgment appealed from and sentence Basilio Ticson to the penalty of three years six months and twenty-one days of <i>prision correccional<\/i>; to pay a fine of 1,000 <i>pesetas<\/i> with the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and the costs of both instances.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

intended for building purposes, with a frontage of 6 <i>brazas<\/i> and a depth of 7, which in 1904 was occupied by a frame house belonging to the defendant.\u00a0 This land was entirely expropriated for the widening of a street in the city of Cebu, the expropriation being in the nature of an exchange, that is, the city gave the defendant another lot or parcel of land equivalent to the condemned property, on which was rebuilt, with somewhat larger dimensions, the house he had had on the expropriated land.\u00a0 In all this matter the committee on street widening, which exercised its functions in the said city of Cebu by virtue of an act expressly passed for the purpose, treated exclusively with the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs now demand the ownership of this land in place of that other expropriated parcel, and allege that the condemned property belonged to them and that the defendant had no right whatever thereto.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs base their action on the following facts: (1) That the land in question originally belonged to Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa; (2) that Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa had a legitimate daughter, named Petrona Borromeo, who married Maximiano Palang, from which marriage several children were born that are the herein plaintiffs; (3) that Petrona Borromeo died in 1899, prior to the death of her mother, Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa, which occurred\u00a0 in 1900, and that, upon the latter's death, the plaintiffs of the\u00a0 surname of Palang inherited, in their mother's representation, the land left by Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa at her death; (4) that this land was held by Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa during her lifetime and\u00a0 was occupied by a house in which she lived, but which was\u00a0 destroyed by fire some time in 1886 or 1887; (5) that, after the destruction of the house, Hilara Pe\u00f1alosa transferred her residence to \"the tiled-roof house,\" one that belonged to a relative of hers named Pe\u00f1alosa, and later, along in the beginning of 1902, the lot was occupied by\u00a0 one\u00a0 Maria Barba with a\u00a0 store, which was also destroyed by a fire that occurred on December 7 of the\u00a0 same year, 1902; and (6) that the lot was immediately thereafter again occupied by the defendant Joaquin Clavano, then married to Maria Barba, with the frame house aforementioned.\u00a0 The foregoing facts were fully admitted at the\u00a0 trial.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs contend that the land was not occupied, first, by Maria Barba, and, afterwards, by her husband Joaquin Clavano, through any right of ownership or other real right of these spouses in the property, but by virtue of a lease executed between the latter and themselves under a rental price of P6 per month, and assert that this suit originated from the fact that, although Joaquin Clavano was authorized by the plaintiffs to construct only a <i>camarin<\/i> or frame building, to be used for storage purposes, similar to the former structure belonging to Maria Barba which had been burned, he erected a large frame house.\u00a0 The plaintiffs state that such unauthorized action was reported by them to their father, then absent in Mambajao, who, upon his return to Cebu, advised them to bring the present suit.\u00a0 Joaquin Clavano, in turn, alleged that he erected the said house, not by virtue of any authorization-given by the plaintiffs, whom he did not recognize as vested with any right whatever in the land in question, but by reason of his own right, as being the owner of the property that he was, on account of his having purchased the same from its original owner, Valentina Pe\u00f1alosa, who in turn had purchased one-half of it from her sister and coowner, Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa, and in such manner became possessed of the entire property.<br\/><br\/>It is also a fact admitted at the trial, that in \"the tiledroof house\" (belonging to one of the Pe\u00f1alosa family) where Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa had taken shelter after the fire of 1886 or 1887, there lived her sister, Valentina Pe\u00f1alosa, together with Maria Barba, and Joaquin Clavano, as well as the plaintiffs, the Palangs, and it may be affirmed that, up to the date of the complaint, 1908, complete harmony existed among them all.<br\/><br\/>The fundamental fact, which it was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to prove in bringing this action for recovery of possession, is the exclusive ownership of the lot which they claim lay in their grandmother, Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa, and this they attempted to establish in no other manner than by the testimony of one of them, Teodoro\u00a0 Palang, and by that of his father, Maximiano Palang.\u00a0 The latter did not substantiate his statements made on the stand, and the iormer's testimony consisted in his mere averment that he had been told by the said Hilaria Penalosa that she had inherited the land from her mother.<br\/><br\/>If this alleged fact of inheritance is true, then, as it is admitted that Hilaria and Valentina Pe\u00f1alosa are sisters, it follows that the lot in question may belong as well to Valentina as to Hilaria, or at least the presumption arises that it ought to belong to them both in equal shares, upon the basis of that mode of acquisition.\u00a0 When the plaintiffs had terminated the presentation of their evidence, no proof had been shown by them in support of the pretended exclusive ownership of Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa, other than the testimony of the two above-mentioned\u00a0 witnesses.\u00a0 Only in rebuttal was any direct testimony given, by the witness Maximiano Palang, and a notarial document adduced, relative to the pretended hereditary title of Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa.\u00a0 Maximiano Palang then testified, and notwithstanding that the question was objected to as being improper on rebuttal, that he had knowledge of a division\u00a0 of inheritance that had been made between Hilaria and Valentina, in which the former had been awarded the said lot.\u00a0 The notarial document, the plaintiffs' Exhibit A, is nothing more than a notarial certificate drawn up at the request of Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa, in which it is recorded that three persons declared that the lot concerned is of the exclusive ownership of Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa inasmuch as she inherited it from her deceased mother, Maria Angulo, that they know this on account of their being neighbors of Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa, and that the lot is probably worth about P200.<br\/><br\/>If a common hereditary right derived from a common predecessor in interest is recognized in behalf of these sisters, a hereditary right that has produced a coownership between them, the termination of such coownership is not sufficiently established by the mere assertion of a single witness to the effect that a partition of inheritance was made between the coowners, when this single witness may be challenged on account of his being the plaintiffs' father and the person who advised the prosecution of this action.<br\/><br\/>Witnesses who affirm the certainty of a right or of a fact, at the request of a party interested in its existence, and make such a statement in a simple notarial certificate without the due solemnity of an oath and without the summoning nor the presence of the party who may be injured by that affirmation, prove nothing at trial by the presentation therein of such notarial certificate,\u00a0 so long as it does not reproduce their testimony with the established legal formalities.\u00a0 Such notarial certificates, by themselves alone, were accorded no legal value as proof by the former <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i>, nor have they such at the present time under the existing Code of Civil Procedure.<br\/><br\/>If at this point the demand for recovery were to be decided, there would be no ground at all on which to allow it, whatever might afterwards be the procedure of the defendant and however deficient his exceptions or defense might be.<br\/><blockquote>\"The possessor by virtue of ownership has in his favor the legal presumption that he holds possession by reason of a sufficient title and he cannot be forced to show it.\"\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 448.)<\/blockquote>But the defendant in turn admits that his and the plaintiffs' rights have a common origin, though not the same, and in this case he must offer satisfactory proof of his sole right at the present time, exclusive of that which in the beginning was shared by both participants.<br\/><br\/>That proof he has furnished by means of the following documents:<br\/><br\/>(1) A public instrument of December 1, 1864, proving that the brothers Mariano and Leonardo Vestil sold to the sisters Hilaria and Valentina Pe\u00f1alosa, for the price of P100, a piece of land 6 <i>brazas<\/i> in frontage by 7 in depth, the boundaries of which were, without objection, specified during the trial for the purpose of identifying it with that which is the subject matter of\u00a0 the\u00a0 complaint.\u00a0 This public instrument is Exhibit 1 of the defendant, Joaquin Clavano.\u00a0 Objection was raised to its admission on the ground that it was irrelevant, but the court overruled the objection and it was admitted in evidence.<br\/><br\/>(2) An official document of December 29, 1864, whereby the provincial government of Cebu granted to the said sisters, Hilaria and Valentina Pe\u00f1alosa, a permit to build a wooden house with a nipa roof on the land described in the public instrument just above\u00a0 mentioned.\u00a0 (Defendant's Exhibit 4.)\u00a0 No objection was made to its admission.<br\/><br\/>(3) A private document executed by Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa in favor of her sister, Valentina Penalosa, on March 10, 1884, whereby the former sold to the latter\u00a0 her one-half interest, then undivided, in the land in question.\u00a0 The document was signed by Brigido Macachur and Lucas Macachur as witnesses.\u00a0 (Defendant's Exhibit 5.)\u00a0 The vendor and the witness Lucas Macachur having died, only Brigido Macachur, who was of legal age, appeared at the trial and vouched\u00a0 for the authenticity of the document and of the signature of the other witness, Lucas Macachur.\u00a0 The opposing party, on the\u00a0 presentation\u00a0 of this document, said:\u00a0 \"We object to the admission of the document, on the ground that it is <i>irrelevant<\/i>.\"\u00a0 The court: \"The document is admitted.\"\u00a0 No exception was taken to this ruling.<br\/><br\/>(4) The document (Exhibit\u00a0 3) proving that Valentina Pe\u00f1alosa in 1905 paid the taxes assessed on the said land.<br\/><br\/>(5) The notarial document (Exhibit 2) proving the sale made of all the land in question by Valentina Pe\u00f1alosa to the defendant Joaquin Clavano, on February 5, 1907, admitted without objection.<br\/><br\/>The findings of the trial court were:<br\/><br\/>(1) That the land in question was acquired by Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa and Valentina Pe\u00f1alosa, through purchase from the brothers Mariano and Leonardo Vestil on December 1, 1864, as proven by Exhibit 1.<br\/><br\/>(2) That the sale made by Valentina Pe\u00f1alosa to Joaquin Clavano on February 5, 1907, is evidenced by Exhibit 2.<br\/><br\/>(3) But that the court cannot believe that the documentary proof of the sale said to have been made by Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa on March 10, 1884, Exhibit 5 of the defense, was drawn up on the date it bears, and is rather of the opinion that it is a forged document.<br\/><br\/>In view of these findings, it has been proven that the origin of the ownership of the land in question it not that averred in the first point of the complaint, to wit, that Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa inherited it from her mother, but the origin stated in the answer, to wit, that it was\u00a0 purchased by the two Pe\u00f1alosa sisters from\u00a0 the two Vestil brothers; that, in accordance with Exhibit 4\u2014it may be added-the house constructed on the land did not belong solely to Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa, but, presumptively, to both the sisters, Hilaria and Valentina, since shortly after they purchased the property from the Vestil brothers, they applied for a permit to build the said house; that it is a fact\u2014which may also be added by way of corroboration\u2014that it was Valentina Pe\u00f1alosa who, in 1905, paid the taxes on the land (Exhibit 3); and that the sale of the land, executed by Valentina Pe\u00f1alosa in favor of Joaquin Clavano, is a fact which was not denied at the trial (Exhibit 2).<br\/><br\/>Considering the facts alleged and the evidence adduced, the document Exhibit 5 of the defense may not be qualified as false.\u00a0 Its contents, certified, vouched, and ratified by the only surviving witness and uriassailed as false at the trial, cannot\u00a0 be held in this decision to be false.\u00a0 Its contents must be deemed to be true, and, consequently, Hilaria Pe\u00f1alosa did sell her one-half of the land to her coowner, Valentina Pe\u00f1alosa, on March 10, 1884, on which date the latter became the sole owner of the land and the joint ownership and tenancy then ceased.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons there is no warrant for the dismissal of this case \"for the time being\" and the reservation of the rights made for each of the parties by the trial court in his judgment.<br\/><br\/>In place thereof, it is our final decision that Joaquin Clavano is\u00a0 the lawful owner of the lot demanded, by reason of titles perfectly conveying ownership.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is reversed, without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Carson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

He returned and after the proper preliminaries a board of special inquiry was convened.\u00a0 After a fair and impartial hearing this board rendered the following decision:<br\/><blockquote>\"The board decides that Uy Kai Hu, alias Yu Ki Hu, arrives at this port as a <i>stowaway<\/i> and does not present the certificate required by law for the admission of Chinese.\u00a0 He expresses a wish to return to China on the same boat.\u00a0 It is Accordingly so ordered.\"<\/blockquote>While petitioner was being held by the customs authorities awaiting deportation, he caused to be filed in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila a petition asking for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he was illegally imprisoned and deprived\u00a0 of his liberty\u00a0 by the customs authorities and that there did not exist any order of commitment which justified his detention.\u00a0 After hearing the trial court ordered the petitioner discharged from custody, saying in part: <br\/><blockquote>\"The petitioner having landed in the Philippine Islands and having his certificate of registration showing him to be a resident of the Philippine Islands, the said board of inquiry had no jurisdiction over him and acted without authority in ordering him deported.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The petitioner actually being in the Philippine Islands and having his certificate of registration in the Islands as a laborer cannot be removed except in the manner as provided by law now in force in the Islands.

On the other hand, it is equally clear that errors of law by that department may be reviewed by the courts in any case wherein it appears that the error has resulted in excluding one who would have been admitted under the facts found had the question of law been correctly decided; that an erroneous conclusion of law, made by those officers, cannot be sustained by being mistakenly called a conclusion of fact; that a conclusion of fact based upon no evidence tending to support it is of no force; that the hearing at which no evidence is introduced is no hearing; and that the customs officers' authority for deportation must be found in the Statute.

Prick, 189 Fed.,146,and cases cited therein under Note 1.)\u00a0 In the case at bar the petitioner was given a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">hearing<\/span> and the board found that he arrived as a stowaway and did not present the required certificate.\u00a0 No other finding of fact was reduced to writing, but we must assume that the board also found that the petitioner was arrested at the time and place and under the circumstances as stated in the accepted facts.\u00a0 From these facts as found the board reached the conclusion (a conclusion of law) that the petitioner must be deported.\u00a0 While we are precluded from reviewing the action of the board as to the findings of fact, we may inquire whether the facts so found do in law justify the deportation.<br\/><br\/>Before determining the legal value of the petitioner's certificate of registration and whether he had \"entered\" the Philippine Islands before he was arrested so as to place him without the jurisdiction of the customs authorities, we will inquire whether\u00a0 or not the customs authorities have the power or are authorized to administer and enforce both the general immigration law and the Chinese exclusion Acts; and also whether or not a Chinese laborer seeking to enter comes within the provisions of both of these bodies of law or within the latter only.<br\/><br\/>The immigration laws and the Chinese exclusion Acts are enforced in the Philippine Islands by the customs authorities.\u00a0 (<i>In re<\/i> Allen, 2 Phil.Rep., 630; Ngo-Ti <i>vs<\/i>. Shuster, 7 PhiL Rep., 355; Jao\u00a0 Igco <i>vs<\/i>. Shuster, 10 Phil. Rep 448; Juan Co <i>vs<\/i>. Rafferty, 14 PhiL Rep.,235; and many other later cases.)\u00a0 The procedure for the enforcement of both bodies of laws is the same. (Chinese and Immigration Circular No. 186, which\u00a0 was promulgated under Act No. 355, section 19, and the Act of Congress of February 6, 1905.)Chinese persons and persons of Chinese descent must be examined by the customs officers as to their right to admission under the provisions of the general immigration Act as well as under the provisions of the laws relating to Chinese exclusion.\u00a0 (Acts of Congress February 20, 1907, and April 29, 1902, and cases cited, <i>supra<\/i>.)<br\/><br\/>When the petitioner was arrested in the manner set forth in the accepted facts he had in his possession a Chinese laborer's certificate of residence.\u00a0 This certificate was issued in 1903, or some two years before he left the Islands.\u00a0 The trial court appears to have been of the opinion that this certificate is conclusive proof of the petitioner's right to remain in the Islands.\u00a0 Of course, this holding rests upon the proposition that the petitioner had entered the Philippine Islands when he was arrested and that therefore the immigration authorities had no jurisdiction in the premises.\u00a0 The certificate of\u00a0 registration was issued under the provisions of Act No. 702 of the Philippine Commission and was conclusive proof of the petitioner's right to then remain in the Islands, but he left this country without first obtaining the return certificate required by section 7 of the Act of September 13,1888.\u00a0 This section reads in part as follows: <br\/><blockquote>\"And no Chinese laborer shall be permitted to reenter the United States without producing to the proper officer of the customs at the port of such entry the return certificate herein required.\"<\/blockquote>The language here used is mandatory.\u00a0 There can be no escape from its provisions.\u00a0 A Chinese laborer must provide himself with one of these return certificates prior to his departure from the country if he would return and reenter.\u00a0 The fact of his departure admitted, as in this case, the only legal method of reentry is by the production of such a certificate.\u00a0 It matters not that the petitioner might have been entitled to have a return certificate issued to him.\u00a0 This certificate is the one prerequisite for reentrance;and if he has it not there is no remedy.\u00a0 There is no authority for dispensing with the production of this certificate.\u00a0 And furthermore, section 7, <i>supra<\/i> provides that such a certificate shall be good for only one year except in certain enumerated cases, when it may be extended for one additional year.\u00a0 As the petitioner remained away for over five years,return certificate issued on his departure, even if produced,would have had no value whatever.\u00a0 It therefore appears that the petitioner has no possible ground for claiming the right to reenter this country.\u00a0 (United States <i>vs<\/i>. Tuck Lee, 120 Fed.,989.)<br\/><br\/>It is contended that the petitioner, having landed from the launch free from all physical restraint by the immigration authorities, had \"entered\" the Philippine Islands and was therefore no longer subject to the administrative proceedings provided for the deportation of undesirable aliens; in other words,that the immigration authorities no longer had jurisdiction over his person.<br\/><br\/>The words \"enter\" and \"entry\" have such a variety of meanings, not only in the jargon of the law, but in their ordinary lay acceptations, that it would be obviously improper to assign a meaning to either not sanctioned by the sense in which the word is used.\u00a0 To enter a country in the sense of the immigration laws means something more than merely stepping upon dry land within its jurisdiction.\u00a0 One does not go into a foreign country as an immigrant with the intention merely of crossing the border.\u00a0 He enters there with the intention of performing acts of business, pleasure, or travel, or to earn a livelihood, all of which necessitates his communicating with the inhabitants and mingling with them.\u00a0 It being recognized as dangerous to the body politic to allow certain classes of aliens to do any of these things, provision is made to examine all aliens upon their arrival at the border line or port of entry, and refuse those who are found to be ineligible any further opportunity of accomplishing whatever their object may have been in coming to the country. What difference exists, if any, between the case of an alien\u00a0 who submits to the lawful method for gaining entrance to the country and the case of an alien who manages to land or cross the border at a place not designated by the immigration authorities and is arrested by them before he has had time to accomplish any of those things for which he may\u00a0 have come to the country?\u00a0 It is clear that whatever his object in coming to the country may be, it is totally defeated by such an arrest, and that, as a matter of fact, he is in no better position in respect to that object than if he had not been passed by the immigration officers.\u00a0 So long as such a person has been prevented from acquiring a residence or domicile and engaging in the ordinary pursuits of life, there can be no excess of authority\u00a0 on the part of the immigration officers in detaining him, for that is exactly what the law authorizes these officers to do until he has passed the required examination.\u00a0 If they may not be permitted to take all steps necessary to accomplish this purpose, it will be very difficult indeed to enforce the law.\u00a0 If by surreptitiously\u00a0 crossing the border at a point along the miles and miles of unguarded border an alien places himself beyond the administrative proceedings of the immigration laws, it is patent that very many who fear the examination will avail themselves of this means of entering the country.<br\/><br\/>It has been urged that the only safe way for the courts to decide this question is to adhere to the rule that an alien once within the boundary limits of the country free from all physical restraint, even for the shortest space of time, must be considered as having \"entered;\" that any other method of deciding this question leads to confusion and uncertainty, with the result that every case must be decided upon its own facts and circumstances.\u00a0 At first sight this is a plausible solution of the question, designed to relieve the courts of a great deal of trouble and worry.\u00a0 It is to be inferred, according to this argument, that if the lawmakers do not desire to countenance such practices it is their duty to pass appropriate legislation whereby the immigration authorities will be empowered to arrest such persons after they have crossed the border.\u00a0 But we apprehend that the passage of such legislation is impracticable.\u00a0 Such a law could not specify that the jurisdiction of the immigration officers extended to only a certain distance into the interior, because in a crowded city an immigrant might take up his residence within a block of the immigration officers and live there unmolested until he was thoroughly domiciled, while at other points along the boundary line he might not be able to find food or shelter until he had penetrated miles into the interior.\u00a0 It could not specify that after a certain time the immigration officers would lose jurisdiction, because he might be in hiding for a month without having been able to take up his residence in any one place, or he may have taken up the ordinary pursuits of life, within a very short period of time.\u00a0 We think the legislation on the subject is sufficiently clear as it now stands and that the question of whether an alien has been domiciled or not is\u00a0 no more difficult in the case of the immigration laws (and we include the Chinese exclusion Acts) than in any other case; nor is it more difficult of solution than questions of contributory negligence, laches, whether evidence constitutes the <i>res gestae<\/i> of a case, and many other questions daily decided by the courts, in which the particular facts and circumstances of the case under consideration largely determine the decision of the court.\u00a0 The petitioner according to the accepted facts having been arrested by the immigration authorities a few minutes after having landed, certainly cannot be said to have \"entered\" the country in the sense of the immigration laws.\u00a0 Nor are we unsupported by authority in so holding.<br\/><br\/>In <i>Ex parte<\/i> Chow Chok et al.\u00a0 (161 Fed., 627) it appears that eight Chinese persons were detained by a Chinese inspector for the purpose of returning them to China, they having been refused admission to enter the United States.\u00a0 After full opportunity to be heard by the immigration authorities on their right to enter, Judge Ray said: <br\/><blockquote>\"The circumstances are somewhat peculiar, and R. M. Moore, an attorney at law,\u00a0 swears out these writs in behalf of these persons, alleging that their detention is unlawful, in that, when apprehended, they had already entered the United States, and were found therein, and were not seeking admission, and that, conceding that they were then unlawfully in the United States and had no right to remain therein, the Chinese inspector in charge, H. R. Sisson, had no jurisdiction or power to hold them in custody and deport them or return them to China or pass on their cases; that they were found in the United\u00a0 States and in no sense have applied for admission into the United States; that they are not seeking to\u00a0 enter, but to remain unmolested;that for these reasons they are entitled to a hearing on the question of their right to be and to remain in the United States before a United States commissioner or judge in the regular way with the usual right of appeal in such cases.\"<\/blockquote>The court, after stating the details concerning the execution of the plan of these eight Chinamen to enter the United States and the action of the immigration authorities in watching their movements up to the point of the arrival of the Chinamen near the border line, said:<br\/><br\/><blockquote>\u00a0\"When near the line, the teams referred to halted, and the Chinese \nalighted and moved toward the border.\u00a0 The inspectors, or some of\u00a0 them,\n kept them in sight, and, as the Chinese' crossed the border, passing \nfrom the highway to the railroad track, and thence along it as they \ncrossed, they were closely followed by Inspectors West and Landis, who \nhad been joined by Inspectors Yale and Dunton, who had been waiting at a\n farm house on the Canada side.\u00a0 All these officers were there for the \npurpose of preventing the illegal entrance of these persons into the \nUnited States,for the purpose of apprehending them if they did enter, \nand sending them back to China if on due examination found not entitled \nto enter.\u00a0 The purpose was to prevent their 'entrance' into the United \nStates, within the intent and meaning of the Chinese exclusion Acts.\u00a0 \nNothing was said to them as they crossed the border into the United \nStates, nor until they have proceeded\u00a0 something like a fourth of a mile\n along the track after crossing the\u00a0 border.\u00a0 Then Inspector Dunton gave\n them to understand they would have to go along with the inspectors.\u00a0 \nFrom that point into Rouse's Point, the nearest railroad station for \ntaking the train to Malone, the nearest port of entry, these petitioners\n were accompanied by Inspectors West, Dunton, and Landis, who took \npossession of and carried most of their baggage.\u00a0 These inspectors were \nacting under the orders of their superior.\u00a0 I sustain the objection to \nthe statement that the inspectors 'took charge of them' as a \nconclusion.\u00a0 Their purpose in being there, and what was said and done, \nare acts which' speak for themselves.\u00a0 It is evident that the officers \ntook them actually into their custody and under their control for the \npurpose of preventing their actual and completed entry into the United \nStates as 'entry' or 'entrance' should be construed; that is, to prevent\n their going at large or becoming domiciled in the United States.\u00a0 It is\n evident the purpose was to take them from the place where they crossed \nthe border by all necessary force, to Malone, the designated point for \nthe admission of Chinese persons into the United\u00a0 States, for due \ninvestigation of the facts bearing on their right to enter into the \nUnited States.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0*<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"I think it clear that 'found unlawfully in the United States' refers to those Chinese persons who have entered the United States, gone at large, mixed with and\u00a0 become a part of our population, and not to those who, arriving at the border, and suspected of having an intention to enter unlawfully, are followed\u00a0 by the officers having authority to exclude them and actually taken into custody and immediately conducted to the nearest port of entry for investigation of their right to enter, so soon as it is developed that it is their purpose to enter unlawfully and go at large in defiance of law.\"<\/blockquote>The writs were dismissed and the petitioners were remanded.\u00a0 This order was affirmed in a <i>per curiam<\/i> opinion by the circuit court of appeals.\u00a0 (163\u00a0 Fed., 1021.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of <i>Ex parte<\/i> Li Dick (174\u00a0 Fed., 674), the proceedings were conducted under the provisions of the Immigration Law of February 20, 1907.\u00a0 It appears that Li Dick was apprehended and taken into custody in the city of Utica, near the central part of the State of New York, on October 22, 1909, on the charge that he was then and there a Chinese alien and that he had surreptitiously entered the United States at or near the town of North Burke from the Dominion of Canada without having produced a certificate of admission or having been examined or inspected as required by the immigration laws and regulations of the United States, and that therefore he had surreptitiously entered in violation of law.\u00a0 Three days later the Acting Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Labor issued his warrant under the provisions of sections 20 and 21 of the Immigration Act and the warrant was placed in the hands of an immigration inspector for execution.\u00a0 Two days thereafter the inspector took Li Dick into custody and he was so held in custody by the inspector when a writ of habeas corpus was applied for and allowed.\u00a0 Li Dick made contradictory statements about his entrance into the United States but finally admitted that he left Montreal, Canada, on a Monday evening preceding his arrest and came by automobile; that he came to Montreal from China, where he had been some eight or nine months; and that he had been in Montreal only a few days.\u00a0 He was asked why he smuggled himself into the United States and stated that he had lived in that country before and wanted to come back again; that he had not made preparations to return at the time he left, as several of his friends had been turned down and he thought he would meet their fate too, So he did not apply; that since he left the United States last he had not applied for readmission at a port of entry for Chinese; that he was to pay the man who brought him into the United States from Montreal in the automobile $170; that he remained in a barn after leaving the automobile until they started for the train and took a rig and drove several hours; and that the same party that brought him from Montreal to the barn took him to the train.\u00a0 The court held as follows: <br\/><blockquote>\"In so far as the status of Li Dick is concerned in his relation to the Department of Commerce and Labor and Bureau of Immigration, I am of the opinion that while he was, in a sense, 'found unlawfully within the United States,' he was when found and apprehended in precisely the same condition as to his right to be and remain in the United States as though he had then presented himself at a port of entry for admission, or had been apprehended by the immigration officers in the very act of crossing the border into the United States in violation of law at some point remote from a port of entry, and there stopped by them.\u00a0 Can there be any\u00a0 question that the immigration officers may prevent such an entry by a Chinese alien even though he had a mercantile domicile in this country prior to his departure, even though such departure and absence was intended to be temporary only?\u00a0 In this case Li Dick had just entered or crossed the border secretly and in the nighttime.\u00a0 He had not reached his destination in the United States.\u00a0 He had not settled down and become a part of the resident population.\u00a0 He was still engaged in the act of surreptitiously entering the United States as much as though he had been on foot running to gain entrance and had reached a point ten or twenty rods this side the boundary line when actually overtaken and apprehended.\u00a0 In such a case as that, must the alien Chinese person be taken before a justice, judge, or a commissioner as one found unlawfully within the United States?\u00a0 Clearly not.

Bello, Santa\") and that he thereupon\u00a0 called to the place Lucio Bajet, the other defendant, who learned about the find.\u00a0 As soon as the trunk was discovered both defendants confessed their commission of the robbery, insistently begged the offended party to pardon them and offered to pay for the stolen articles.<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing facts, the provincial fiscal filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur, charging the defendants with the crime of robbery; and, upon the evidence adduced at trial, the judgment aforementioned was rendered.<br\/><br\/>The facts above related, which were duly proved, certainly constitute the crime of robbery perpetrated in an inhabited house, though it was not shown that the robbers were carrying arms at the time of its commission., nor that the stolen articles exceeded, all together, the value of 1,250 <i>pesetas<\/i>.\u00a0 This crime is provided for and punished by articles 502 and 508, last paragraph, of the Penal Code, and, in the case at bar, may not be classified as one of theft, as was done by the lower court in the judgment appealed from, inasmuch as the record shows it to have been perfectly proved that, in order to remove the trunks containing the bank note and other stolen effects from the house where they among others were stored, the robbers unnailed the strip that held fast the two panels of the window and removed them for the purpose of taking the offended party's two aforesaid trunks.\u00a0 The robbers were unable to enter the building by going up the stairs and passing through the common door, for the reason that it was closed and fastened with a padlock.<br\/><br\/>Although the offended party used to sleep at night in the said house as the caretaker of its owner, Meliton Prudencio, he had not done so the previous night on account of his absence in another pueblo.\u00a0 Nothing unusual had happened on the other occasions when he had not slept there.<br\/><br\/>The crime is classified as one of robbery of an inhabited house, since the building was used as a dwelling, although there was no one actually present in the house at the time of the robbery, and such casual absence cannot bring the crime within the classification of robbery in an uninhabited place, for the reason that the building was ordinarily inhabited and intended as a dwelling, the inhabitants of which might have suffered bodily harm during the commission of the crime, and it is on this account that the penal law punishes more severely the robbery of a house used\u00a0 as a dwelling than that committed in an uninhabited place.<br\/><br\/>Despite the denial of the defendants and their plea of not guilty, the record discloses decisive and conclusive proof of their guilt as the proved perpetrators by direct participation of the robbery under prosecution.\u00a0 The defendant Bajet did not testify, and no weight can be given to the allegation of his codefendant, Peralta, that he found one of the stolen trunks and the pair of shoes on some land covered with reed grass or in a ricefield, inasmuch as, after the defendants learned that the offended party, Apolinario Bello, the owner of the missing trunks, had discovered that Peralta had sold one of these to his aunt, Petrona Coronel, for P5, and when, several days afterwards, Bello recognized the pair of shoes which this same defendant was wearing about the streets of the pueblo of Santa, they visited the house of the aggrieved party, on several occasions, to ask his pardon and beg him not to prosecute them, offering to pay him P32 to indemnify him for the articles stolen, though he refused to accept this amount as it did not cover their value.\u00a0 The defendants confessed several times that it was Peralta who climbed into the house after tearing off the two panels of the window, while Lucio Bajet remained outside below the window to receive the stolen articles.\u00a0 Cornelio Peralta, in whose house the offended party was when the defendants came accompanied by Antonio Burgos, the latter, and Roberto Bello, all heard these statements and so testified and that they were present when they were made and when the defendants asked the offended party's pardon and begged him not to prosecute them.\u00a0 Juan Peralta Baldiviso, another witness, also testified that he was present in the house of the offended party when the defendants, who were likewise there, begged the former to withdraw his complaint and offered to pay him the\u00a0 value of what had been stolen, Petrona Coronel testified that she had bought one of the said trunks, some time in the month of May, and that it was sold to her by the defendant, Alejandro Peralta, for P5.<br\/><br\/>So, it is not true that the defendants found the recovered trunk on some land covered with reed grass, as Alejandro Peralta stated that he had in his testimony and tried to prove by his witnesses, because this allegation was believed by his own statements made before the offended party and several witnesses in whose presence he confessed the crime in question and that he stole the trunks in company with Lucio Bajet.\u00a0 It is not to be believed that the robbers, were they other than the defendants, would have abandoned the trunk alleged to have been found by the defendant Peralta and would not have carried it away with them, together with its contents, including the pair of shoes, and it is common sense to presume that the possessor of a thing stolen wrongfully took it, unless it be satisfactory proven that the crime was committed by another.\u00a0 As against the unproven allegation of the defendant Peralta, his codefendant Lucio Bajet not having testified in his own\u00a0 behalf, the record shows convincing proof that they both committed the robbery of the two trunks in the manner disclosed by the evidence.<br\/><br\/>It is not to be held that the crime was attended by any extenuating or aggravating circumstance, nor by that of nocturnity, inasmuch as the fact that the neighbor, Ildefonso Buenavista, saw the window of the house open and its panels leaning against the wall of the building, notice of which he sent to the offended party in charge of the premises, does not prove that the robbery was committed the previous night and during the darkness, for the crime might have been perpetrated on the preceding day, before nightfall, as there was no one in the house at that time.\u00a0 For this reason the circumstance of nocturnity should not be taken into consideration in

Segun refiere en su demanda, en el ano 1895, siendo capitan municipal del pueblo de Tiagon en Camarines sur Ponciano Badurria, le embargo ambos terrenos por defecto de pago de una multa administrativa y se apodero de dichas propiedades, y que Ramon Bayot, Antonio Callo, Rogerio Cabrera y Matias Carbonel sabiendo que estas propiedades de ella se apoderaron de las mismas y benificiaron el abaca desde 1895.<br\/><br\/>Todos los demandados contestaron la demanda negando los hechos afirmados en ella y alegando ademas la prescripcion ordinaria. Ramon Bayot ademas alego haber comprado el peimer terreno de que se trata a Ponciano Badurria en 3 de Julio de 1903 y en el edifico una casa que le vino a costar unos ocho mil pesos, (en las pruebas resulto que unos ochocientos pesos).<br\/><br\/>En el juicio, la demandante presento varios testigos para prober que los terrenos fueron vendidos, no en 1895, segun se dice en la demanda sino en 1894 por Ponciano Badurria, siendo este entonces gobernadorcillo del pueblo de Tigaon.<br\/><br\/>Acerca del primer terreno senalado con letra (a0 en la demanda, el Juzgado de primera Instancia de Ambos Camarines estimo preponderancia de pruebas para establecer las siguientes conclusiones: 1.o que en 1893, siendo gobernadorcillo de Tiagon Nicolas Carbonel, recibio una orden de embargo de la Inspeccion de Montes contra la demandante, y de acuerdo con dicha orden de embargo procedio a la venta del terreno y casa de esta para obtener el pago de una multa de 172 pesos; 2.o que en la venta que se efectuo despues de publicado el correspondiente bandillo en el pueblo de Tiagon, Ponciano Badurria compro dicho terreno y casa; y 3.o que en 1903, mediante escritura ratificada ante Notario, compro Ramon Bayot a Ponciano Badurria el solar, sin la casa que este habia ya derribado por su mal estado, siendo comprador de buena fe, sin prueba alguna ofrecida en el juicio de haber procedido fraudulentamente.<br\/><br\/>Cuanto al segundo terreno senalado con letra (b) en la demanda, el Juzgado a quo estima que fue vendido en aquella misma subasta segun se afirma por algunos testigos, pero no ha hallado pruebas de quien o quienes fueron los que lo compraron: y que Ponciano Badurria niega haberlo comprado, y el Juzgado esta de ello convencido.<br\/><br\/>\"El Juzgado es de opinion que la defensa de prescipcion alegada por los demandados Ponciano Badurria y Ramon Bayot es valida y eficaz.

The appellants, who were plaintiffs in the court of first instance, claim as descendants of a marriage between the intestate and Yap Puan Niu, a Chinese woman, said to have been contracted in 1847 at Am Thau, in the Province of Amoy, China. The appellees claim as the descendants of a marriage with Petronila Encarnacion, a Filipino woman, celebrated in 1853 at Vigan, in the Philippines. The principal question here, as in the insular courts is whether the proof sufficiently established the Chinese marriage. On this the insular courts differed, the court of first instance finding the marriage adequately proved, and the supreme court, one justice dissenting, holding the other way. (16 Phil. Rep., 137.) Before coming to the evidence directly addressed to this question it will be well to state the facts about which there is no dispute.<p><\/p><p>Sy Quia was born at Am Thau, China, in 1822, and went to the Philippines at the age of twelve. At first he was located in Manila, but at some time before 1852 went to Vigan and entered the service of a merchant at an annual salary of 200 pesos. During that year he was converted to the Catholic faith and was baptized in the parish church. The next year he married Petronila, the bans being regularly published and the marriage publicly solemnized according to the rites of the church, as a preliminary to which he affirmed under oath, and the civil and ecclesiastical authorities certified after inquiry, that he was then unmarried. Shortly after the marriage he and Petronila took up their permanent home in Manila. They were then without any particular property other than 5,000 pesos which she received from her mother and brought into the conjugal society. He became a merchant, and through their united efforts they accumulated real and personal property amounting at the time of his death to upwards of 600,000 pesos. They lived in a manner becoming the marital state and were universally recognized as husband and wife. Three sons and two daughters were born of the marriage. One of the daughters married and predeceased her father, leaving a son surviving. The other died after the father, leaving the mother as her only heir. Following Sy Quia's death the widow administered the estate, with the aid of the sons until 1900, when through appropriate judicial proceedings the property was distributed among the widow, sons and grandson as the persons rightly entitled thereto. The present suit was brought in 1905, more than half a century after the marriage, and then for the first time was its validity or its good faith as to either spouse brought in question\u2014a fact which is of particular significance, first, because Yap Puan Niu, the alleged Chinese wife, visited in Manila at the home of a brother of Sy Quia twice during the life of the latter, and, second, because two of the plaintiffs were adults living in Manila at the time of Sy Quia's death and during the eleven years intervening before the suit was brought.<\/p><p>There was testimony, taken by way of depositions in China, tending to show that Sy Quia returned from the Philippines to Am Thau in 1847, when he was twenty-five years old; that during that year he married Yap Puan Niu, the marriage being properly arranged and celebrated; that he remained at Am Thau three or four years, during.which two sons were born of this marriage; that he then returned to the Philippines and Yap Puan Niu continued to reside at Am Thau, dying there in 1891; that the four plaintiffs are the only living descendants of this marriage, two being grandsons, one a granddaughter, and one a great-grandson. Six of the witnesses in China testified directly to the marriage, and their testimony, if standing alone, would be quite persuasive of its occurrence, notwithstanding some discrepancies in their statements. But this testimony did not stand alone. It was met and contradicted by that of several Filipino witnesses, taken mostly by deposition, to the effect that they had known Sy Quia in Vigan for some years before his marriage to Petronila in 1853, and that he was living there during the period when, according to the opposing testimony, he married Yap Puan Niu and remained in China. One of these witnesses was an aged man, who testified with certainty that he was a student at Manila between 1839 and 1845 and knew Sy Quia there; that he, the witness, was married at Vigan, in 1847, and that Sy Quia was living there then. Others of these witnesses give kindred reasons for their ability to speak with precision concerning Sy Quia's presence at Vigan during the period in question. Still other witnesses gave testimony more or less corroborative of these opposing theories, but it was less direct and was also contradictory.<\/p><p>In addition to this conflicting testimony there was this situation, as before indicated: The Philippine marriage and the forty years of uninterrupted marital life following it were not only established but conceded. While Sy Quia lived the validity of that marriage passed unchallenged and no right was asserted under the one alleged to have occurred in China. More than this, the right of the widow and children of the Philippine marriage to the property acquired during its existence went unquestioned for eleven years after his death and for five years after the judicial distribution of the property.<\/p><p>In these circumstances every presumption was in favor of the validity and good faith of the Philippine marriage, and sound reason required that it be not impugned and discredited through the alleged prior marriage save upon proof so clear, strong, and unequivocal as to produce a moral conviction of the existence of that impediment. The conflicting testimony, isolatedly considered, did not measure up to this standard, and clearly it did not do so if proper regard was had for the probative force of the conduct of all the parties concerned during: the many intervening years. Then, too, the lips of Sy Quia and Yap Puan Niu had been sealed by death, and this, with the long interval of time, gave unusual opportunity for the use of fabricated testimony, the untruth of which it would be difficult to expose.<\/p><p>Giving due effect to these considerations, we cannot say that the Supreme Court of the Philippines erred in holding that the Chinese marriage was not adequately proved. Indeed, we regard the evidence as not producing a moral conviction of the existence of that marriage, but as leaving the issue in serious doubt. The decree is accordingly affirmed.<br\/><\/p><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 228 U.S., 335; 57 L. ed, 862.<\/div>",

The\u00a0 ground upon which counsel bases his contention as to the alleged illegality of the detention of these prisoners is an alleged error committed by the trial court in convicting them of the crime of abduction of a virgin with her consent (<i>rapto de una doncella con su anuencia<\/i>) despite the fact that, as counsel insists, the woman was in truth over 18 years of age at the time when the alleged crime was committed.\u00a0 In support of his conteitnon counsel relies upon the doctrine laid down by this court in the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Fideldia, decided on March 26, 1912,<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[2]<\/sup> wherein a majority of the court held that a conviction for this crime was erroneous in a case wherein it appeared that the woman who was alleged to have been abducted with her own consent (<i>con su anuencia<\/i>) was over 18 years of age at the time when she left her home.<br\/><br\/>We agree with counsel for the petitioners that under the doctrine laid down in the Fideldia case, judgment of conviction was erroneously entered by the trial court and erroneously affirmed by\u00a0 us, if the allegations of the petitioners are true, and if it is a fact that the record in the case in which these petitioners were convicted and sentenced does not disclose that the woman whom they were charged with having abducted was less than 18 years of age at the time when the alleged crime was committed.\u00a0 But such an error, if in fact it was committed, in no wise affected the jurisdiction of the court below to render judgment of conviction and to sentence the petitioners for the crime of which they were convicted.\u00a0 Throughout the entire course of those proceedings in the trial court, that court had jurisdiction of both of the persons of the accused and of the crime with which they were charged, and it did not and could not lose that jurisdiction as a consequence of mistake or error committed by the trial judge in his finding of fact as to the age of the woman, or in his\u00a0 conclusions of law as to the bearing of the woman's age upon the question of the guilt or innocence of the accused of the crime with, which they were charged.<br\/><br\/>If the record in the former case disclosed that the woman was between 18 and 20 years old, as alleged by the petitioners, and, indeed if it failed to disclose that she was less than 18 years of age, and had the doctrine laid down in the Fideldia case been applied to the facts thus found, the defendants should have been acquitted in the lower court, or in the event of their conviction, the judgment of conviction should have been set aside on appeal. The fact is, however, that both in the court below and in this court on appeal, the point passed <i>sub silentio,<\/i> and the attention of neither\u00a0 court was invited or directed to the question raised in the later case (U. S, <i>vs<\/i>. Fideldia, <i>supra<\/i>) upon a discussion of which it was held that\u00a0 the Code provisions defining and penalizing the crime of <i>rapto<\/i> had been modified, so as to reduce the age limit of women who may become the victims of such abductions from 23 to 18.<br\/><br\/>But the writ of habeas corpus is not a remedy provided for the correction of such errors.\u00a0 Courts cannot, in habeas corpus proceedings, review the record in a criminal case after judgment of conviction has been rendered, and the defendants have entered on the execution of the sentence imposed, to ascertain whether the facts found by the trial were in accordance with the evidence\u00a0 disclosed by the record, or in order to pass upon the correctness of the conclusions of law by the trial court based on the facts thus found.\u00a0 Under the statute, a commitment in due form based on a final judgment convicting and sentencing a defendant in a criminal case is conclusive evidence of the legality of his detention under such commitment, unless it appears that the court which pronounced the judgment was without jurisdiction or exceeded its jurisdiction in imposing the penalty.\u00a0 Mere errors of law or of fact, which did not have the effect of depriving the trial court of its jurisdiction over the cause and the person of the defendant, if corrected at all, must be corrected on appeal in the form and manner prescribed by law.<br\/><br\/>Even if it be true that the court below erred in convicting these defendants, and that this court erred in affirming this judgment of conviction, it has gone beyond the power of the courts to correct the error, and relief must be sought elsewhere.<br\/><br\/>The application for the writ must be denied, with the costs of these proceedings <i>de oficio<\/i>.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Rep., 745):<br\/><blockquote>\"Upon the defendant's appeal from the Court of First Instance to this court, eight errors were assigned by him.\u00a0 The first four relate to the question of adultery.\u00a0 This court sustained those assignments and said;<br\/><br\/>\" 'Our conclusion is that neither one of the parties is entitled to a divorce.\u00a0 The result makes it unnecessary to consider that part of the judgment which relates to the settlement of the conjugal partnership.'<br\/><br\/>\"The action of this court upon those four assignments of error relating to adultery was reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States, and by the decision of that court they were definitely disposed of.\u00a0 The other assignments of error relate to that part of the decision of the Court of First Instance which treats of the division of the conjugal property, the allowance of alimony, and the order of the court below that the case be referred to the fiscal for criminal proceedings against the defendant.\u00a0 As has been said, these assignments of error were not considered by this court in view of the result which it reached upon the other assignments.\u00a0 Nor were they discussed by the Supreme Court of the United States.<br\/><br\/>\"The claim of the appellant now is, however, that the whole case was finally disposed of by the decision of the latter court, and that the only thing remaining for this court to do is to affirm the judgment of the Court of First Instance in its entirety.<br\/><br\/>\"With this view we cannot agree.\u00a0 The only thing considered by the Supreme Court of the United States was that part of the decision of the Court of First Instance which related to the right of the plaintiff to a divorce.\u00a0 It did not pass upon the division of the conjugal property.\u00a0 Its order was that the case be remanded to this court for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion.\u00a0 If the contention of the plaintiff is true, it seems that the order of that court would have been one reversing the judgment of this court and affirming that of the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 By remanding the case to this court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of the Supreme Court, it seems to have been the intention of that court that this court should dispose of the assignments of error not already disposed of.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"The sixth assignment of error\u00a0 was as follows:<br\/><br\/>\" 'Error was incurred in fixing the amount of the half of said alleged conjugal property at P81,042.75, without having examined the\u00a0 necessary antecedents and data, and, moreover, without having taken into account the losses suffered and the debts contracted by the firm of Hijos de I. de la Rama.'<br\/><br\/>\"This\u00a0 assignment of error not having been considered either by the Supreme Court of the United States or by this court, is now open to consideration by us, and must, we think, be sustained.\u00a0 The Civil Code states in detail the manner in which the affairs of a conjugal partnership shall be settled after the\u00a0 same has been dissolved.\u00a0 Article 1418 provides, except in certain cases not here important, that an inventory shall at once be made.\u00a0 We have held in the case of\u00a0 Alfonso <i>vs<\/i>. Natividad (6 Phil. Rep., 240), that when the partnership is dissolved by the death of the husband this inventory must be made in the proceedings for the settlement\u00a0 of his estate.\u00a0 And in the case of Prado <i>vs<\/i>. Lagera (7 Phil. Rep., 395), that the inventory\u00a0 thus formed must include the <i>bienes parafernales<\/i> of the wife.\u00a0 It is very evident from the provisions of the Civil Code that the inventory includes the\u00a0 capital of the husband, the dowry of the wife, the <i>bienes parafernales<\/i> of the wife, and all the property acquired by the partnership during its existence.\u00a0 After this inventory has been made it is provided by article 1421 that there shall be first paid the dowry of the wife, in the second place the <i>bienes parafernales<\/i> of the wife, in the third place the debts and obligations of the conjugal partnership, and in the fourth place the capital of the husband.\u00a0 Articles 1424 and 1426 then\u00a0 provide as follows;<br\/><br\/>\" 'Art. 1424.\u00a0 After the deductions from the inventoried estate specified in the three preceding articles have been made, the remainder of the same estate shall constitute the assets of the conjugal partnership.'<br\/><br\/>\" 'Art. 1426.\u00a0 The net remainder of the partnership property shall be divided, share and share alike, between the husband and the wife, or their respective heirs.'<br\/><br\/>\"It is thus seen that the conjugal property which is to be divided when the partnership is dissolved is determined not with reference to the income or profits which may have been received during the partnership by the spouses, but rather by the amount of the actual property possessed by them at such dissolution after making the deductions and payments aforesaid.\u00a0 This is positively provided by article 1424.<br\/><br\/>\"An examination of the decision of the Court of First Instance shows that no attempt was made to comply with any one of these statutory provisions.\u00a0 No inventory of the partnership property existing at the time of the trial, at which the liquidation was made, was ever formed.\u00a0 No provision was made for paying to the wife the sum of 2,000 pesos, which was either the dowry or <i>bienes parafernales<\/i> of the wife.\u00a0 No provision was made for returning to the husband his capital in the partnership, which amounted to at least one-third of the assets of the firm of Hijos de I. de la Rama, which assets, according to the inventory made January 30, 1901, amounted to\u00a0 1,130,568' pesos.\u00a0 The court below rejected entirely the method prescribed by the Civil Code for the liquidation of this partnership and in fact liquidated it, as appears from the decision,\u00a0 upon an entirely different basis.\u00a0 He determined in the first place the income which each person had received from\u00a0 his or her property during the partnership, finding that the wife during that time had received from her property 345 pesos as income and that the husband had received 162,430.53 pesos.\u00a0 He then says:<br\/><br\/>\" 'The total value, therefore, of the conjugal partnership existing between the plaintiff and the defendant in the present case amounts to 162,775.53\u00a0 pesos.\u00a0 The words of the statute say that the same must be divided share and share alike.\u00a0 This mean&amp; that each should\u00a0 have 81,387.76 pesos.\u00a0 The wife already having in her possesion 345 pesos of this sum, she is entitled to receive\u00a0 from the husband 81,042.76 pesos as being the sum necessary to equalize the holdings of the property which, according to the statute, must be regarded as belonging to the conjugal partnership.'<br\/><br\/>\"It needs no argument to show that this manner of liquidating the affairs of the conjugal partnership is entirely unwarranted by the law.\u00a0 The theory of the Civil Code is that the conjugal property is the actual property which is left at the dissolution of the partnership.\u00a0 It can, therefore, never be determined by adding up the profits, which had been made each year during its existence, and then saying that that result is the conjugal property.\u00a0 The difference between the two system of liquidation is well illustrated in this case.\u00a0 The court below found that the profits of the partnership of Hijos de I. de la Rama from the time of its organization up to June 30,1901, amounted to 290,101.31 pesos.\u00a0 The evidence in the case shows, however, that the capital with which the firm started was 1,058,192 pesos, and that on June 30, 1901, the value of its entire property was 1,130,568 pesos, an increase of only 72,376 pesos.\u00a0 Taking the method adopted by the court below, if the conjugal partnership had been dissolved on June 30, 1901, it would have had as an asset one-fourth of this sum of 290,101.31 pesos, but following the rule laid down by the Civil Code it would have only had one-fourth of 72,376 pesos, the difference between the value of the property of said firm when it was\u00a0 organized and its value on the 30th of June, 1901.<br\/><br\/>\"The other assignments of error were not urged in the last brief presented by the appellant and in any event we do not think they can be sustained.<br\/><br\/>\"The result is that that part of the judgment of the Court of First Instance ordering the divorce, ordering the payment of 3,200 pesos Mexican currency by the defendant to the plaintiff, and the costs of the action, is affirmed.\u00a0 That part of it ordering the payment by the defendant to the plaintiff of 81,042.76 pesos Mexican currency is set aside, and the case is remanded to the court below for the purpose of liquidating in this action the affairs of the conjugal partnership (considering the same to have been dissolved on the 5th of July, 1902) in accordance with the rules laid down in the Civil Code, and a judgment will be entered in that court for the amount which appears from such liquidation to be due from the defendant to the plaintiff.\"<\/blockquote>To the judgment of this court overruling the motion and sending the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial, plaintiff duly saved her exception.<br\/><br\/>Upon the new trial in the court below, judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of P58,543.37, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from July 5, 1902, the date of the original judgment decreeing the divorce.<br\/><br\/>From this judgment both plaintiff and defendant appealed, and the case is once again before us upon their bills of exceptions.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff on this appeal adheres to her contentions set up in the motion to affirm the original judgment of the Court of First Instance submitted after the case had been remanded to this court from the Supreme Court of the United States and insists that:<br\/><blockquote>\"This court was without jurisdiction to review the evidence taken in the court below at the first trial, or retry the questions of fact, because the defendant failed to file in the Court of First Instance a motion for a new trial, upon the ground that the findings of fact were plainly and manifestly against the weight of evidence.<br\/><br\/>\"The action of this court of January 23, 1907, in holding that the motion for a new trial in the Court of First Instance on the ground that the conclusions which in said decision had been deduced from the facts are contradictory to what the evidence filed in the case has shown is a compliance with section 497, paragraph 3, of the Code of Civil Procedure, is inconsistent with and contrary to the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States expressed in the decision of that court on said identical motion then under\u00a0 consideration by said court in this cause on appeal, and such ruling, therefore, is a failure to comply with the mandate of the said United States Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>\"In any event, the findings of the Court of First Instance were not so 'plainly and manifestly against the weight of evidence,' as to authorize this court to set aside said findings of fact and set aside and annul the judgment rendered by the trial court based\u00a0 on\u00a0 said findings of fact.\"<\/blockquote>All of the contentions of plaintiff-appellant in support of these assignments of error were disposed of in the opinion filed upon her motion in 1906 in De la Rama <i>vs<\/i>. De la Rama (7 Phil. Rep., 745), as appears from the extracts therefrom hereinbefore set forth; and the court is of opinion that it should adhere to the position taken at that time.<br\/><br\/>The contentions of the defendant-appellant on this appeal are, substantially, that the trial court erred in its findings of fact as to the value of the conjugal property, and in the mode of procedure adopted in liquidating the partnership assets.<br\/><br\/>After a careful review of the entire record, we think that the findings of fact by the trial judge are fully sustained by the evidence, and that the method adopted by him in liquidating the assets of the conjugal partnership was substantially in accord with the method prescribed in the code and indicated in our opinion filed with our judgment remanding the case for a new trial.\u00a0 (De la Rama <i>vs<\/i>. De la Rama, 7 Phil. Rep., 745.)<br\/><br\/>The principal contention of defendant-appellant on this appeal is that the trial court erred in failing to deduct from the amount allowed to the plaintiff-appellant the sum of P45,567, that being the amount of conjugal property which defendant claims \"had accumulated and come into plaintiff's possession\" at the time when the divorce was granted.<br\/><br\/>We agree with the trial judge that the evidence of record fails utterly to sustain this extraordinary\u00a0 contention.\u00a0 Discussing the defendant's claim in this regard the trial court said:\u00a0 \"The testimony presented by defendant to establish his claim that plaintiff had accumulated and was in possession of P45,567 of conjugal property is very uncertain and unsatisfactory and much of it is not pertinent and cannot be considered.\u00a0 Much of it relates to transactions carried on by her in the purchase of nipa and palay some considerable period prior to July 5, 1902, and to personal and real property that came into her possession by gift or purchase (and partly on borrowed funds) some years after that period.\u00a0 The testimony presented on her behalf in the most material parts is in flat contradiction of that on behalf of the defendant, and it appears the more reasonable, and in conformity with her mode and manner of living.\u00a0 It is the opinion of this court that the evidence does not show that on July 5, 1902, the plaintiff was possessed, in the concept of owner, of property in excess of value over the P2,000 inherited from her father and her individual loans and indebtedness.\"<br\/><br\/>And elsewhere in his opinion the trial judge, commenting upon defendant's claim, made use of the following language:\u00a0 \"His reason for insisting that she is only entitled to recover from him less than P1,000 is that he contends that the testimony presented by him shows that his wife, since her separation from him in 1892 and up to July 5, 1902, had accumulated by her own efforts and with no other capital than the P2,000 left her in 1899, the amount of P45,567 of conjugal property.<br\/><blockquote>\"That is, the defendant contends that while he, as manager of a firm of over a million pesos capital, drawing a large salary with other perquisites, and having a one-fourth and sometimes a one-third interest as a copartner, has only succeeded in acquiring some P50,000 of conjugal property\u2014while his wife, a girl only fifteen years old at the time of their separation, has supported herself and with only P2,000, left her in\u00a0 1899, has by her sole efforts accumulated P45,000 of conjugal property in the same period of time.\"<\/blockquote>In so far as defendant-appellant's assignments of error are based on the action of the trial court in refusing to accept as true the contents of the document described as Exhibit 1, it might be sufficient to say that we are of opinion thiat the reasons for doing\u00a0 so set forth by the trial judge himself in his opinion are a sufficient refutation of defendant-appellant's contentions in this regard.\u00a0 Exhibit 1 purports to be an inventory of the property of the firm of \"Hijos de I. de la Rama\" as of July 5, 1902.\u00a0 The bulk of the conjugal property consisted of an undivided\u00a0 share of this property.\u00a0 As pointed out by the trial judge, this inventory appears to have been prepared by or for the defendant for-the purposes of this action; and in any event it was prepared after this action was originally instituted, and under conditions which justified the trial judge in believing that the defendant had every opportunity to intervene in its preparation and to use his personal influence to have the document speak favorably to his contentions.\u00a0 Granting that it is true, as contended by defendant, that this document was admitted in evidence without objection, it by no means follows that the trial judge was bound to accept its contents as true where other evidence of record disclosed its inaccuracies and its failure correctly to list the properties in question.\u00a0 It was admitted for what it was worth as evidence, but in the very nature of things, it should not be held as conclusive of the truth of its contents.\u00a0 We think that the trial judge is fully sustained by the evidence of record in his findings that this inventory failed to set forth the true status of the affairs of the company, and we are of opinion, and so 'hold, that there was no error in his findings as to the true value of the property in question.<br\/><br\/>What has been said sufficiently disposes of all the errors assigned.\u00a0 We are of opinion, therefore, that there is nothing in the record which would justify us in sustaining the contentions of the defendant-appellant as to error in the findings of fact or in the conclusions drawn therefrom in the opinion filed by the trial judge.<br\/><br\/>The judgment entered in the court below should be and is hereby affirmed, without costs to either party.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Clemente and Bartolome Pasis presented an inventory of said\u00a0 estate, signing the same as administrators.<br\/><br\/>On the 10th of August, 1910, an order was made by the judge of the court appointing Florencio Lagasca and Santiago Mata as commissioners for the purpose of dividing the estate of Do\u00f1a Paulina Ver among her heirs and legatees.\u00a0 Said commissioners made\u00a0 their report which shows that the estate had been divided among the various heirs and legatees on the 29th of August, 1910, which report was confirmed by the judge on the 2d of September, 1910.<br\/><br\/>Objections having been made to the partition of the said commissioners, Florencio Lagasca and Santiago Mata, an order was made on the 28th of January, 1911, annulling the said partition and appointing Isias G. Clemente as commissioner for the purpose of making a new partition of the estate among the heirs.\u00a0 The said Isias G. Clemente later made his report as to the partition of said estate, to which an objection was\u00a0 made on the part of some of the heirs, and on the 20th of January, 1911, said partition was annulled and Don David Flor was appointed as a commissioner, for the purpose of making another partition of said estate among the heirs.\u00a0 The said Don David Flor concluded his partition of said estate on the 5th of May, 1911, which report was presented to the court on the 11th of July, 1911.<br\/><br\/>Finally, on the 1st of September, 1911, we find that the Honorable Dionisio Chanco rendered a judgment finally disposing of the cause.\u00a0 The final judgment was as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The case deals with the\u00a0 testamentary estate of the deceased Paulina Ver, and the attempt is now made therein to approve the partition made by the commissioner of the property of the said deceased.<br\/><br\/>\"Clotilde Pasis, Bartolome Pasis, and Bonifacia Alvano object to said approval.<br\/><br\/>\"It appears from the case that, after the death of the late Paulina Ver, which occurred on November 1, 1902, and on or about the 10th of the same month and year, when the petition for the probate of her will was presented to the court, the heirs voluntarily and on the initiative of Cunegunda Leano divided the property of the deceased, each one assuming ownership, possession and enjoyment therein of the part that fell to him in the partition, with exclusion of anybody else, to the extent that some of them have sold their respective shares to other persons.\u00a0 This is understood, for otherwise those who made the sales would have been unable to do so, if the lands had remained <i>pro indiviso<\/i>, or, if they had made the sales despite the nonpartition, those who are now asking for judicial partition would have raised a cry to heaven.\u00a0 But that was not the case, for they have let six years elapse and only when they have become ambitious have they presented the motion for the partition.<br\/><br\/>\"Naturally the partition made by the heirs voluntarily and spontaneously must produce and has produced a legal status, which cannot be annulled merely for\u00a0 the caprice of one person.\u00a0 And it cannot be said that, because the partition was not made in accordance with the will, if such be the case, the latter has to be annulled, for by voluntarily and spontaneously concurring therein they implicity renounced the effects of said will, of which they were aware.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, and because the property divided by the commissioner among the heirs is the same as that already divided extrajudicially among them about ten years ago, the court decides this case by holding that the extrajudicial partition made by the heirs\u00a0 was proper and that there is no occasion for approval of the one made by the commissioner; without express finding as to costs.\"<\/blockquote>From that judgment Cunegunda Lea\u00f1o appealed to this court and made several assignments of error.\u00a0 The principal assignment of error is that the lower court\u00a0 committed an error in deciding that the heirs and legatees of the estate of Do\u00f1a Paulina Ver had voluntarily divided the estate among themselves.\u00a0 The appellees contend that the judge committed no error in reaching that conclusion.\u00a0 The record has been examined in vain to find any proof whatever upon the question further than the\u00a0 mere statement of the parties.\u00a0 It would appear that many things transpired in relation to the cause in the lower court which are not made of record.\u00a0 In view of the positive finding of the judge of the lower court that there had been a voluntary partition of the estate among the heirs and legatees and in the absence of positive proof to the contrary, we must conclude that the lower court had some evidence to support his conclusion.\u00a0 If the heirs and legatees had voluntarily divided the estate among themselves, then their division is conclusive, unless\u00a0 and until it is shown that there were debts existing against the estate which had not been paid.\u00a0 No claim is made whatever by third parties nor objections of any character are made by others than the heirs against said partition.\u00a0 We see no reason why the heirs and\u00a0 legatees should not be bound by their voluntary acts.<br\/><br\/>For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

CROSSFIELD, JUDGE, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>PER CURIAM:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\"> This was an original action for the writ of certiorari.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the record that on or about the 24th of June, 1912, a complaint was presented against the respondents, Joseph M. Heery and Joseph J. Capurro, in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila, charging them with a violation of the Opium Law, Upon the complaint the respondents were duly arrested and brought to trial.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence, the respondent judge, the Honorable A. S. Crossfield, on the 30th of July, 1912, found the respondents Heery and Capurro guilty of the crime charged and sentenced each of them to be imprisoned for a period of six months and each to pay a fine of P800 and one-half the costs.<br\/><br\/>Said sentence was read to the respondents Heery and Capurro on the 2d of August, 1912.<br\/><br\/>On the 5th of August, 1912, the respondents Heery and Capurro presented a petition for a modification of said sentence. Said petition was set for hearing before the respondent judge on the 10th of August, 1912. On the 10th of August the hearing on said motion was suspended until the 16th of August, 1912. Later the respondent judge, after considering said motion, dictated an order modifying the original sentence and sentenced each of the defendants to pay a fine <i>only<\/i> of P2,000'and each to pay one-half the costs.<br\/><br\/>There seems to be some confusion between the parties with reference to the date of the order of the court, modifying the sentence of the 2d of August, 1912.\u00a0 From an examination of the record brought to this court, it seems to be clear that the modified sentence <i>was not made of record or announced to the respondents Heery and Capurro until the 19th of August, 1912<\/i>, The modified sentence did not become a sentence in law until the same had been read or announced to the defendants or had become a part of the record of the court.<br\/><br\/>The basis of the present petition is the alleged fact that the respondent judge, having permitted more than fifteen days to elapse before modifying the original sentence, lost jurisdiction to modify it; that in modifying the same after the expiration of fifteen days he did so without authority of law; that such modification having been made without authority of law and after the respondent judge had lost jurisdiction over said sentence, the modification was null and void.\u00a0 The petitioner relies upon section 47 of General Orders, No. 58, in support of his contention. Said section 47 provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"An appeal must be taken within fifteen days from the rendition of the judgment or order appealed from.\"<\/blockquote>It will be noted that the original sentence was read to the defendants on the 2d of August, 1912; that the modified sentence was read to the defendants on the 19th of August, 1912; that seventeen days had elapsed from the announcement of the original sentence before the announcement of the modified sentence.<br\/><br\/>The respondents contend that the motion for a rehearing or for a modification of the first sentence had the effect of extending the fifteen days within which sentences become final.\u00a0 That specific question has been heretofore discussed and decided by this court.<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Flemister (1 Phil. Rep. 317), Mr. Justice Willard, speaking for the court, said (p. 321):<br\/><blockquote>\"Our conclusions are (1) that within the fifteen days allowed for an appeal the trial court may reopen the case on either of two grounds; (2) that if the defendant does not appeal he can make no motion in this court on either ground; (3) that if he does appeal he can move in this court on either ground. If the defendant makes a motion in the lower court and that is denied, he can still appeal if the fifteen days allowed therefor have not expired. If the defendant fails to appeal and limits himself to a motion in the trial court to reopen the case, this motion fails if it is not decided within the <i>nonextendable<\/i> period of fifteen days.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Perez (1 Phil. Rep., 322), this court again, speaking through Mr. Justice Willard, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The pendency of a motion for a new trial does not extend the time for an appeal beyond the fifteen days after judgment.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Trincio (4 Phil. Rep., 90) the court again adhered to the doctrine announced in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Flemister and that of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Perez, <i>supra<\/i>, and said:<br\/><blockquote>\"(1) Appeals in criminal cases will not be allowed after the lapse of fifteen days from rendition of the judgment or order appealed from.<br\/><br\/>\"(2) Pendency of a motion for new trial does not extend the time for perfecting appeal.<br\/><br\/>\"(3) Motion for new trial fails, <i>ipso facto<\/i>, if the judge neglects or fails to decide the same within the said fifteen days.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Torrero (8 Phil. Rep., 88) the court again adhered to the doctrine announced in the foregoing cases and said:<br\/><br\/>\"A motion for a new trial in a criminal cause does not extend the time within which an appeal must be taken.\"\u00a0 (See also U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Rota et al., 9 Phil. Rep., 426.)<\/blockquote>If the motion does not have the effect of extending the time, then certainly the sentence becomes final by the mere lapse of the fifteen days. It will be noted also that by section 47 of General Orders, No. 58, above quoted, as heretofore interpreted by this court, that the sentence becomes final and nonappealable after the expiration of fifteen days.<br\/><br\/>By reference to section 42 of General Orders, No. 58, it will be noted that under certain conditions steps may be taken for the reopening of the trial, but it will also be noted that such steps must be taken <i>before the final entry of a judgment for conviction.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The respondents cite .numerous cases showing that a judge pronouncing a sentence in a criminal case may change, alter, or modify his sentence <i>at any time during the term of court in which the sentence was announced<\/i>. The cases cited by the respondents contain the general rule upon that question and sustain their contention.\u00a0 These cases are all cited from jurisdictions which give the defendant in criminal cases a right to appeal from the sentence imposed at any time during the term in which such sentence was rendered. Upon the other hand the decisions of the courts are just as uniform that the courts may not alter, change, or modify a sentence rendered, <i>after the expiration of the term<\/i> in which said sentence was rendered.\u00a0 The doctrine seems to be well settled, that if the sentence is not modified during the term of court in which it was rendered, it becomes final and cannot thereafter be changed or modified by the court or judge rendering the same, unless by some intervention or other the sentence has not become final by reason of the termination of the term of court.<br\/><br\/>By virtue of the provisions of said section 47 of General Orders, No. 58, <i>the sentence in a criminal case in the Philippine Islands becomes final after the mere lapse of fifteen days from the date of' its rendition<\/i>.\u00a0 The lapse of fifteen days, therefore, from the rendition of the judgment has the same effect in the Philippine Islands upon the finality of the sentence as the expiration of the term of court in other jurisdictions.<br\/><br\/>The question of the finality of a judgment and the right to modify it has been discussed many times by the Supreme Court of the United States. In the case of Bronson <i>vs<\/i>. Schulten (104 U. S., 410), Mr. Justice Miller, in discussing the question before us, said (p. 415) :<br\/><blockquote>\"It is a general rule of law that all judgments, decrees, or other orders of the courts, however conclusive in their character, are under the control of the court which pronounces them, during the term at which they were rendered or entered of record, and they may then be set aside, vacate modified, or annulled by that court.<br\/><br\/>\"But it is a rule equally well settled that after the term is ended, all final judgments and decrees of the court pass beyond its control, unless steps be taken during that term, by motion or otherwise, to set aside, modify, or correct them; <i>and if errors exist, they can only be corrected by such proceeding, by writ of error or appeal as may be allowed in a court which, by law, can review the decision<\/i>., So strongly has this principle, been upheld by this court, that while realizing that there is no court which can review its decisions, it has invariably refused all applications for rehearing made after the adjournment of the court for the term at which the judgment was rendered. And this is placed upon the ground that the case has passed beyond the control of the court. (Brooks <i>vs<\/i>. Railroad Co., 102 U. S., 107; Public Schools <i>vs<\/i>. Walker, 9 Wall., 603; Brown <i>vs<\/i>. Aspden, 14 How., 25; Cameron <i>vs<\/i>. McRoberts, 3 Wheat, 591; Sibbald <i>vs<\/i>. U. S., 12 Pet., 488; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. The Brig Glamorgan, 2 Curt. C. C, 236; Bradford <i>vs<\/i>. Peterson, 1 A. K. Marsh (Ky), 464; Ballard <i>vs<\/i>. Davis, 3 J. J. Marsh <ky><\/ky><\/blockquote>In the case of Sibbald <i>vs<\/i>. United States (37 U. S <i>vs<\/i>. 487), the Supreme Court of the United States, speaking through Mr. Justice Baldwin, said:<br\/><blockquote>\"No principle is better settled, or of more universal application, that no court can reverse or annul its own final decrees or judgments for errors of fact or law, after the term in which they have been rendered, <i>unless for clerical mistakes.\"<\/i><\/blockquote>In the case of Baldwin <i>vs<\/i>. Kramer (2 Cal., 582) the supreme court of California said (p. 583):<br\/><blockquote>\"We hold, that after the expiration of a term of the district court, no power remains in it to set aside a judgment, or grant a new trial. A different doctrine would lead to great uncertainty and possibly to gross abuse. There must be a time when the rights of the parties are to be considered as determined, and for litigation to cease; and for this purpose the law has wisely fixed the rule here indicated.\" Suydam <i>vs<\/i>. Pitcher (4 CaL, 280); Carpenter <i>vs<\/i>. Hart (5 Cal., 406); Robb <i>vs<\/i>. Robb (6 Cal., 21); Shaw <i>vs<\/i>. McGregor (8 CaL, 521); Bell <i>vs<\/i>. Thompson (19 Cal., 706); Lattimer <i>vs<\/i>. Ryan (20 Cal., 628).<\/blockquote>In the case of Casement <i>vs<\/i>. Ringgold (28 Cal., 335), Mr. Justice Sawyer, speaking for the court, said, quoting from the decision of Lattimer <i>vs<\/i>. Ryan, <i>supra<\/i> (p. 338):<br\/><blockquote>\"According to the repeated decisions of this court, jurisdiction to set aside the first judgment had been lost to the district court upon the adjournment of the term at which it was rendered.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Samio (3 Phil. Rep., 691), this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Torres, said (p. 692) :<br\/><blockquote>\"Under the provisions of General Orders, No. 58, as modified by Act No, 194, judgments rendered in criminal cases in trial courts become final by operation of law if no appeal is taken within the time prescribed, with the exception of cases where the death penalty is imposed, which go to the Supreme Court for review whether the accused appeals or not.\"<\/blockquote>Courts have gone to great length in prohibiting the alteration, vacation or modification of a sentence or judgment, after the same has become final.\u00a0 Generally sentences do not become final, by virtue of statutory provision, until after the expiration of the term in which they are rendered. So strongly have courts adhered to the doctrine that a decision can not be changed, altered or modified after the same has become final, that even an order entered by the judge that \"all cases, motions, or other proceedings, now pending and not otherwise disposed of, be continued,\" will not authorize the setting aside of a judgment at a subsequent term. (Gunnell <i>vs<\/i>. State Bank, 13 Ala., 676.) In the case of Siloam Springs <i>vs<\/i>. McPhitridge (53 Ark., 21) it was held that a judgment became final at the end of the term at which it was rendered and that the court could not set it aside at a subsequent term, even though the court had taken under advisement a motion for a new trial, and in an arrested judgment had entered an order suspending judgment until his decision was rendered upon said motion.\u00a0 This rule has been modified in some of the States of the Union to the effect that a motion for a new trial, not decided during the term, would have the effect of preventing a judgment or sentence from becoming final.\u00a0 (Hibbard <i>vs<\/i>. Mueller, 86 111., 256; Gans <i>vs<\/i>. Harmison, 44 Wis., 323; Baker <i>vs<\/i>. Baker, 51 Wis., 538.)<br\/><br\/>Long experience has induced the courts to establish the rule that when a sentence once becomes .final it can not be changed, altered, or modified by them. It is believed to be the wiser policy after a sentence has once become final, in case it is then discovered for the first time that clemency should have been exercised, to refer the matter to the executive.department of the Government to be dealt with under its general pardoning power.<br\/><br\/>The moment a sentence in a criminal case becomes final, the judicial department of the Government has lost its jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, as well as its right to change, alter or amend said sentence.\u00a0 The defendant is then in the custody of the executive department of the Government for the execution of the sentence.\u00a0 If an injustice has inadvertently been done, the executive department has authority, under its general pardoning power, to correct it.<br\/><br\/>Any attempt by the judicial department to alter, amend or modify the sentence, except to correct clerical errors, after the same has become final, is unwarranted in law and can in no way affect the final sentence.<br\/><br\/>From all of the foregoing, the following conclusions necessarily follow:<br\/><ol><li>That after the lapse of fifteen days from the date of the sentence of August 2, 1912, the respondent judge was without authority to alter, amend, modify or annul said sentence, except for the purpose of correcting clerical errors.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That the modification complained of was null and without the force of law.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That the sentence of August 2, 1912, is the sentence of the lower court and is in full force and effect.\u00a0 Said alleged modification in no way affected the sentence read to the defendants on August 2.<\/li><\/ol>Therefore, after the lapse of ten days from the promulgation hereof, let a judgment be entered decreeing the annulment of the modified sentence of the respondent judge, read or announced to the defendants on the 19th of August, 1912; and without any finding as to costs it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa<\/i>, and <i>Johnson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">TRENT, J.,<\/span> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">concurring:<\/span><br\/><br\/>I concur.\u00a0 But if the question whether the motion for a new trial in a criminal case extends the time within which an appeal can be taken were an open one I would take a different view from that established by this court. <\/div>",

rendered in this case by the Honorable Vicente Jocson, judge.<br\/><br\/>On September 2, 1903, Nicasio Capule, for the purpose of appropriating to himself a tract of coconut land, situated in the town of San Pablo, Laguna, without the knowledge or consent of the owners thereof, the married couple Aniceto Maghirang and Isabel Pili, by agreement and cooperation with the notary public, Inocente Martinez, who later died, prepared and drew up a document setting forth the sale in his favor of the said land, pretending that it was made and executed by the said owners of the tract, stating in the document that they had made the declaration that they had sold said land for the sum of P550 pesos paid at the time of the sale to the vendors, and Jacinto Pe\u00f1aflor and Jorge Tolentino appear in said document as witnesses of the execution thereof; and Eulogio Ortega and Doroteo Guia as the signers of the deed of sale, because the alleged vendors did not know how to do so.\u00a0 Recorded at the bottom of the document was their ratification of its contents in the presence of said notary, before\u00a0 whom the said married couple appeared.\u00a0 The defendant Capule exhibited said document later, although he had been assured that it was false, in a trial before the justice of the peace of that town in the attempt to sustain his alleged right to the said piece of land.<br\/><br\/>For this reason a complaint was filed on February 3, 1910, by the provincial fiscal in the Court of First Instance of Laguna, charging Nicasio Capule with the crimes of falsification of a public document and <i>estafa<\/i>.\u00a0 After due trial the judge rendered judgment therein on March 21, 1911, sentencing Nicasio Capule to the penalty of eight years of <i>presidio mayor<\/i>, to payment of a fine of 2,000 <i>pesetas<\/i>, the accessories, and the costs; from which judgment the defendant appealed.<br\/><br\/>The document whose falsification is here in question, Exhibit A, the original whereof appears at pages 17 and 148 of,the file of exhibits and has been attached to the complaint, seems to have been executed on September 2, 1903, by Aniceto Maghirang y Espiritu and Isabel Pili y Emnaceno, of legal age, residents of San Pablo who declare therein that they have agreed with the accused Capule on the real and absolute sale of a piece of land planted with 42 fruit-bearing coconut trees and approximately 300 not bearing fruit, for the sum of P550, which the\u00a0 purchaser has paid them to their entire satisfaction, which land is located in the place called Quinayoan, barrio of Dolores of the said town, with its boundaries and situation stated; and further setting forth that the land is the property of Isabel Pili, who acquired it by inheritance from her deceased niece, Claudia Reyes, according to a certified copy of some affidavit proceedings; that the land described had not,been sold, ceded or encumbered in favor\u00a0 of any person other than Nicasio Capule, to whom then and thenceforth they delivered the possession and usufruct of said land as its legitimate owner, with right to\u00a0 alienate it, they being responsible to Capule, his heirs and successors in interest for the ownership, and agreeing to defend him against any just claims that might be presented; and Nicasio Capule y Capitulo, informed of the contents of the document by the vendor married couple, accepted it on his part; and as the vendors do not know how to sign Eulogio Ortega and Doroteo Guia do so at their request, as does also the purchaser, who signs the document in duplicate and to the same effect in the town hall of San Pablo, and there furthermore appear therein, the signatures of Jacinto Penaflor and Jorge Tolentino as witnesses.\u00a0 On the same date appears the certificate of the notary public, whose commission extended to January 1, 1905, wherein it is recorded that personally appeared before him the married couple Maghirang and Pili, whom he knew as the executors of the foregoing document and they ratified it as executed of their own free will, the husband, as well as the purchaser, exhibiting his cedula, but not the woman\u00a0 because she was exempt from payment thereof.<br\/><br\/>It likewise appears from the evidence adduced in this case that said married couple Maghirang and Pili were the owners of said land, which they possessed and had the usufruct of and for which they paid to the Government the corresponding land tax; that on January 31, 1904, said married couple sold a portion of said land with 150 coconut trees to Esteban Reyes and his wife Elisea Maghirang for 250 pesos, according to Exhibit B, and since then Reyes has possessed and had the usufruct of the portion of land he had bought, and made declaration before the land-tax board in May, 1906, as of land belonging to him, according to Exhibit E, which sale was ratified by the vendors in favor of Reyes before the notary Segundo Abrera on May 2, 1908, Exhibit C.<br\/><br\/>On May 2, 1908, the married couple Aniceto Maghirang and Isabel Pili likewise sold the remaining portion of the said land with its coconut trees to Melecio Bri\u00f1as for the sum of 650 pesos, before the notary public Segundo Abrera, according to Exhibit J, and since then Bri\u00f1as has possessed and had the usufruct of the land purchased, although in the tax list the tract continues in the name of the vender, who had made declaration in May, 1906, Exhibit\u00a0 K, and had been paying the tax from 1903, Exhibit P, although Reyes, the owner of one part which he had bought in 1904, appears to have paid the tax up to 1910, Exhibit F.<br\/><br\/>Although Esteban Reyes was in lawful possession of a portion of the land he had purchased, on February 2, 1909, Nicasio Capule filed a complaint before the justice of the peace of San Pablo accusing him of the theft of coconuts from the land he possessed and of which Reyes was the owner; but the court dismissed the case for lack of evidence of the right alleged by the plaintiff, with the costs against him, Exhibit D, page 17 of the record.<br\/><br\/>On April 16, 1909, Nicasio Capule, claiming to be the owner of the coconut land situated in Dolores, the subject matter of an alleged sale, accused the married couple Maghirang and Pili and Eusebio Soriano of theft, and in spite of the fact that he exhibited the document marked \"Exhibit A\", setting forth the said sale made in his favor by that married couple, the justice of the peace acquitted the accused of the crime of theft, Exhibit 1, page 67; and on June 4, 1909, according to Exhibit I, page 107 of said record, Aniceto Maghirang and Guadalupe Javier were also acquitted of the crime of coercion with which they were accused.<br\/><br\/>On October 21, 1909, Nicasio Capule and his wife were accused by Nemesio Brinas of the crime of theft in the justice of the peace court of San Pablo and upon trial were sentenced to two months of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> and payment of P14.25 with the costs, from which judgment they appealed to the Court of First Instance, page 54 of the\u00a0 record, although at the request of the fiscal the case was dismissed, because the action exercised by the complainant had to be settled in a civil suit.<br\/><br\/>Although Capule presented, in some of the said hearings before the justice of the peace court of San Pablo, the deed of sale, Exhibit A, for the purpose of proving that he was the owner of the land in question, yet in the judgments rendered therein said instrument was held to be false and no probative value whatever was attached to it.<br\/><br\/>Aniceto Maghirang denies that he sold the said land to Nicasio Capule or that he executed in his favor any document of sale, stating that he had conferred a power of attorney upon him so that he might represent himself and his wife, who later died, in a suit they had with Maximino Reyes, because of the absolute confidence they had in the defendant, just as it was the latter himself who\u00a0 drew up the document that was later signed in his stead by Eulogio Ortega, because he could not read or write; but he denied that he or his wife had ever been in the house of the notary Inocente Martinez to execute or ratify any document or that he and his wife Isabel Pili, when she was alive, had told the defendant Capule that they wished to sell the said land and that he had offered to buy it.<br\/><br\/>Nicasio Capule avers that the said document, Exhibit A, was drawn up in his own house in the presence of the married couple, Aniceto Maghirang and Isabel Pili, for whom he had to translate the contents of the document into Tagalog, and they then signified their agreement; and as they could not sign, Eulogio Ortega and Doroteo Guia did so in their stead, and at that time Jacinto Pe\u00f1aflor and Jorge Tolentino also signed it as witnesses; and that on the afternoon of that day the married couple Maghirang and Pili appeared in the house of the notary Martinez and ratified before\u00a0 him the said document in the presence of the witness testifying; all of which Aniceto Maghirang denies, asserting that he did. not execute said document, or ratify it before the notary Martinez, for he had never been in the latter's house nor had he ever seen the document, Exhibit A.\u00a0 His wife, Isabel Pili, did not testify, for she had died in the meantime.<br\/><br\/>Let us examine the statements of the persons who appear to have signed the document, impugned as false, in place of the married couple executing it, and of one of the witnesses to the execution of the said document, for it does not appear that the other, Jorge\u00a0 Tolentino, testified.<br\/><br\/>Upon making his statement and after having been informed of the contents of the document, Exhibit A, Doroteo Guia denied that he had been present in the drawing up and execution thereof, or that he had ever known that the married couple Aniceto Maghirang and Isabel Pili had sold any land to the defendant, Nicasio Capule, although he remembered that on a certain occasion said married couple had asked him to sign for them in the defendant Capule's house a document of power of attorney made out in Capule's favor, so that the latter might represent them in a suit they were prosecuting against Maximino Reyes, and believing that it was in fact a question of a power of attorney, as they\u00a0 had assured him, went to the defendant's house and without informing himself of the contents of the document that Capule spread out on a table, signed it, but he denies that Eulogio Ortega, Jacinto Pe\u00f1aflor, and Jorge Tolentino, with whom he was acquainted, were present in that house.<br\/><br\/>Eulogio Ortega likewise denied that he signed any document of sale of land or that he had ever been informed that the married couple Maghirang and Pili had sold any land to the defendant Nicasio\u00a0 Capule, although he remembers that one day about seven years ago Nicasio Capule and Isabel Pili came to his house and the latter told him that as she did not know how to write she begged him to do the favor of signing in her stead a power of attorney, whereupon the defendant told him that as he did not know Spanish the contents of said document would be translated to him so that he might understand them, stating at the same time that a power of attorney was conferred upon him, Capule, by Aniceto Maghirang and Isabel Pili in the suit against Maximino Reyes, the attorney thus authorized responding for its result, without the necessity for the intervention of the married couple granting the power; and that after being informed of the contents of the document presented to him he signed it, and he asserts that said document is Exhibit A; that on that occasion Doroteo Guia, Jacinto Pe\u00f1aflor, and Jorge Tolentino were not present; and that one Sunday, when he was passing a <i>tienda<\/i> with Jorge Tolentino and Domingo Capuno, the defendant Capule, who was there, called to him and after offering them wine told him that they should understand each other for that document which he, Capule, had said was a power of attorney was really a deed of sale executed in his favor by Aniceto Maghirang and in case of winning the suit Capule would give him P200.<br\/><br\/>Jacinto Pe\u00f1aflor, who figures in said document as a witness, having the same before him, stated that the signature which\u00a0 appears therein with his name and surname looks like his, but he could not assert definitely whether such signature was his or not, for he does not remember having signed such a document in the presence of the married couple Maghirang and Pili and the individuals Eulogio Ortega, Doroteo Guia, and Jorge Tolentino, setting forth the sale of a tract of land to Nicasio Capule, and that he did not recognize the signatures of Doroteo Guia and Eulogio Ortega.<br\/><br\/>From the result of taking these statements and the conduct of the accused together, it is logically inferred that after preparing the document, Exhibit A, he tried by all the means he thought expedient to assert his ownership of the land which, under an alleged title of acquisition, had come to be his property and to that end he tried to dispose of the products of the young trees that were on the tract, even daring to trample upon the legitimate rights of its original owners and of the new ones who had later acquired it, up to the point of accusing them as perpetrators of crimes directed against his pretended and false right of ownership, which he claimed to have acquired through the said false instrument.<br\/><br\/>Believing that with the document, Exhibit A, he could get the courts to override the true owners of the land, which he pretended its original owners had sold, in the various complaints he presented before the justice of the peace of San Pablo against the offended alleged owners and one of the new owners who acquired part of the land in question, as well as when he was accused of theft by the owner of the remaining part of the tract, the defendant dared to assert that he was the owner thereof and of the coconut trees growing thereon, even to the point of exhibiting said false instrument, but in spite of his allegations and his documentary evidence the persons accused by him were acquitted, while Capule himself was convicted of theft of coconuts on a complaint of one of the owners of the said land.\u00a0 The notary, Inocente Martinez, was not examined, for he had died in the meantime.<br\/><br\/>It therefore appears to be plainly proven that the crime of falsification of a document has been committed, and while it may not be public still it is of an official or notarial character, provided for and penalized in articles 300 and 301, because the defendant executed upon said notarial document of an official character acts constituting falsification, by counterfeiting therein the intervention of the married couple Aniceto Maghirang and Isabel Pili, to whom he ascribed statements different from what they had made to him and by perverting the,truth in the narration of facts, getting two persons to sign in the name of said married couple through deceit, after giving them to understand that the document contained a commission or power of attorney, when in fact it was a deed of sale of a piece of land, the legitimate owners whereof had never intended or\u00a0 consented to its alienation.<br\/><br\/>None of the persons who appear to have signed said document and seem to have been present at its execution were informed of its true contents, because they all confided with the greatest good faith in the false and deceitful statements of the defendant, believing what he said to the effect that said instrument was a commission voluntarily conferred upon him by the couple executing it, who never intended, to execute any document of sale of their property to the defendant, who went to the extreme of getting a notary to certify to its ratification before him, made apparently by the alleged vendors in the contents of the said false document.<br\/><br\/>The fact that the married couple Maghirang and Pili did not know how to read and write certainly reveals great ignorance and lack of culture in them, but when they got to be landowners and acquired property of some value, they cannot be absolutely denied the ability to distinguish a deed of sale from a power of attorney, because they have demonstrated well enough that they\u00a0 understood their purpose to be that the defendant should represent\u00a0 them in a suit pending1 in a court and that they had never intended or executed any act for the alienation of a tract of land belonging to them in favor of the defendant, and it is therefore unquestionable that he took advantage of the opportunity when he was to have executed a document or instrument of power of attorney, which the married couple desired, to draw up maliciously and\u00a0 deceitfully a deed of sale in his favor, deceiving the alleged vendors and the two persons who signed for them and making them believe, that the document executed was a power of attorney or commission, when in fact it was a deed of sale and is the Exhibit A, wherein, if he did not forge the signatures of the two witnesses Pe\u00f1aflor and Tolentino, he must have obtained them in an equally deceitful way.<br\/><br\/>If it were true that the vendors had really alienated their coconut land to the defendant, their continuing to pay the land tax is unexplained.\u00a0 In January, 1904, a part of said land with its coconut trees was sold to Esteban Reyes and in May, 1908, the rest of the tract was sold to Melecio Bri\u00f1as.\u00a0 Persons so simple, even ignorant and of little culture, as the offended parties, would not have dared to sell successively to two of their neighbors in two portions the said land, if it had been in fact already sold to the defendant Capule; while the latter, by profession a clerk and acting as such for the notary Martinez, who made sworn statements before the assessment board and paid the land tax for the year 1906, never complied with these obligations of landowner in connection with the land which, according to Exhibit A, he had acquired on September 2, 1903, yet on the other hand it does not appear why he did not enter in possession of the tract if he had really bought it in September of that year, which indicates that although he dared to draw up a false document with the connivance of the notary, his boldness did not prevail to the extent of depriving in a frank and open manner its legitimate owners of the possession of the land by appealing to the courts to assert his right, provided he was sure that it was legitimate.<br\/><br\/>Although under article 535 of the Penal Code those who commit fraud by causing another to subscribe a document by the use of deceit, as the defendant has done, incur, according to paragraph 7 thereof, the penalties set forth in the preceding article; still when as in the present case the crime of falsification was committed for the purpose of getting a piece of real property, which is the profit its perpetrator sought to obtain, he is regarded as duly punished as guilty of falsification of a notarial document, in which crime fraud or <i>estafa<\/i> is held to be included,\u00a0 with the penalties indicated in said article 301 of the Code.<br\/><br\/>The defendant pleaded not guilty and alleged that the married couple Maghirang and Pili had positively sold him the land to which Exhibit A refers for the sum of P500 which he forthwith delivered to them, Eulogio Ortega and Doroteo Guia and two other eyewitnesses to the execution of the document, having signed\u00a0 the instrument which he drew up in his house in the presence of all of them, and that it was he who drew up the certificate of ratification authorized by the notary and interpreted the contents of the document with its ratification before the notary to the vendors, who really did not know or understand Spanish, on the afternoon of the same date on which said instrument was drawn up; further stating that immediately afterwards he took possession, in the same month of September, 1903, of the land he had bought and from that time on picked the fruit the coconut trees produced, although he was disturbed in his possession by the vendors themselves and the neighbors Esteban Reyes and Melecio Bri\u00f1as; that it was true that he had not in 1906 made any declaration of ownership of said land, as is ordered for the purposes of assessment, but he paid the land tax for that time by delivering the money to Isabel Pili, although he did riot know whether the receipts had been made out in her name.\u00a0 The defendant, who is a person of more education and knowledge than the offended parties, even alleged other defenses which were in like manner as those stated completely unsupported.<br\/><br\/>He tried to prove that in January, 1906, he sold said land under <i>pacto de retro<\/i> for two years to Andres Borja, who possessed it during those two years, although the alleged purchaser Borja said that only a private document was made out for the sale nor did he require of the defendant any previous document of ownership to evidence the defendant's right to the land sold, which private document was not exhibited in the case and no proof was adduced to show Borja's possession of the land sold to him; and what is stranger still is that in the declaration of ownership of the land, Exhibit K, page 116, presented by the offended party Aniceto Maghirang in May of the same year, 1906, the alleged Andres Borja appears to have signed as a witness,attesting that the land was Aniceto Maghirang's and thus Andres Borja signs at page 87 of his statement, in spite of the alleged previous purchase, nor does it appear that the defendant redeemed the tract.<br\/><br\/>An attempt was also made to prove that in November, 1908, the defendant Capule sold the same land absolutely to Marcelino Capirina with another tract, which is set forth in the document, Exhibit B, ratified before a notary, for the sum of P2,500, and the purchaser forthwith took possession of the lands sold.\u00a0 If this absolute sale is true it is incomprehensible why the purchaser Capirina did not ever attempt to enter into possession of the land in\u00a0 question sold to him in November, 1908, on which date the original owners, Maghirang and Pili, had already got rid of said land, having sold a part thereof to Esteban Reyes on January 31, 1904, and the remainder on May 2, 1908, to Melecio Bri\u00f1as.\u00a0 These new owners took possession from that time on of the respective portions of the land they had acquired, nor does it at all appear in the case that the purchaser Capirina asked the\u00a0 alleged vendor to make delivery of the land sold to him, or that he ever appealed in any way to the courts.\u00a0 Moreover, in presenting his complaints years later against the married couple Maghirang and Pili and others, the defendant Capule did so in the capacity of owner of that very land, so it is not true that he had previously sold it to the said Capiri\u00f1a.<br\/><br\/>These two alleged, sales to Borja and Capiri\u00f1a were ways and means chosen by the defendant to see if he could effectually deprive the married couple Maghirang and Pili of their right to the land in question, since at that time he did not yet dare to exhibit the false instrument he had maliciously and fraudulently drawn up and he did not secure from said document the results he expected and intended to become the owner of the land by means of a false instrument.<br\/><br\/>Likewise the alleged transaction that he says Eulogio Ortega proposed to him to allow rescission of the alleged sale in the document, Exhibit A, through return of the price by the vendors, a transaction proposed, according to the accused and his witness. Silvestre Capiri\u00f1a, one day in the month of July, 1909, is in every way unlikely to have been made in the name of Aniceto Maghirang, because the land had already been sold some years before to Esteban Reyes and Melecio Bri\u00f1as, and therefore the offended party could not get Ortega to talk with the defendant to propose said transaction for the return of a piece of land\u00a0 that had never been sold to him but to the said Reyes and Bri\u00f1as in 1904 and 1908, and in 1909 he no longer had any interest or right in the land in question, aside from the fact that he has not proved that the offended party Maghirang ever intrusted such a commission to Eulogio Ortega or authorized him to make the proposition.\u00a0 Eulogio Ortega denied having interviewed the defendant Capule on behalf of Aniceto Maghirang.\u00a0 Such allegations\u00a0 are nothing more than ingenious quibbles and tricks invented by the defendant's counsel to save him from the punishment he deserves as the proven perpetrator of the crime of falsification.<br\/><br\/>Starting from the hypothesis that the defendant really obtained in a fraudulent and deceitful manner the consent of the married couple Maghirang and Pili to the execution of said false instrument, his counsel argues that still he was not guilty of the crime of falsification of a public document, in accordance with the finding of this court in the decision of the case against Geronimo Milla (4 Phil. Rep.,391), wherein the following principle was laid down:<br\/><blockquote>\"The fact that one's consent to a contract may be obtained by mistake, violence, intimidation, or fraud does not make the contract a false contract, and therefore a person who has obtained such contract by those means, whatever be the crime he may be guilty of, is not guilty of the crime of falsification either of a public or of a private document.\"<\/blockquote>This was the question of a contract wherein the offended parties gave their consent to the execution of the document that was later impugned as false, although this consent was obtained through intimidation which the defendants in that case, Juan Cardona and Geronimo Milla, had used upon them, and for this reason the court, in view of the fact that the contracting parties consented to the terms of the instrument, could not find that there was falsification in the statement of the facts, according to article 300 of the Penal Code, merely because the consent had been secured through intimidation.<br\/><br\/>As has been seen, there was no contract in the present case, nor any consent to the contract pretended to have been stipulated in the instrument, Exhibit A, wherein the defendant entered statements ascribed to the alleged vendors, who proposed and intended to execute an instrument of commission or power of attorney in favor of the defendant, but not a deed of sale, as in bad faith and with evident perverseness the defendant did, perverting the truth in the statement of the facts and ascribing to the offended parties statements different from those they made to him in the counterfeited document, since the statements set forth therein were not characteristic and constitutive of an instrument of power of attorney in his favor in order that he might represent them in a suit against Maximino Reyes.<br\/><br\/>Finally, the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States\u00a0 in the case of Weems <i>vs<\/i>. U. S. (217 U. S., 349) is vainly invoked, for Nicasio Capule is not a public officer and, moreover, as he is accused of the crime of falsification of a notarial document of official character equivalent to a public document the principle laid down in said decision is totally inapplicable in his favor.\u00a0 The defendant Capule does not come within the purview of article 300 of the Penal Code, but of 301, which fixes the penalty, not of <i>cadena temporal<\/i> but of <i>presidio mayor<\/i>; further keeping in mind that the act of falsification of a public document in itself constitutes a crime, morally and legally punishable, even though to date the penal law with respect to falsification of a public document committed by public officers, in lieu of said article 300 of the code, has not yet been promulgated; but article 301, applicable to the present case, has not been repealed and subsists in all its force.<br\/><br\/>The concurrence of neither extenuating nor aggravating circumstances can be found in the commission of the crime, and therefore the penalty fixed in said article 301 of the code must be imposed in its medium degree.<br\/><br\/>For these reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from\u00a0 are found to be refuted, we hold that it should be affirmed; provided, however, that Nicasio Capule be sentenced to the penalty of eight years and one day of <i>presidio mayor<\/i>, to the accessories fixed in article 57 of the code, to the payment of a fine of 5,000 <i>pesetas<\/i>, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, according to article 51; and to the costs in the case.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C, J., Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Carson, JJ<\/i>., concur. <\/div>",

Ostrand, auxiliary judge of the Court of Land Registration, reached the conclusion that the plaintiffs were entitled to have said land registered in accordance with the prayer of their petition.\u00a0 To the\u00a0 decision of the lower court, exception by the opponents was duly presented.\u00a0 A motion for a new trial was made and denied.\u00a0 From the conclusion of the lower court the opponents appealed.\u00a0 In this court the Attorney-General, on behalf of the Insular Government,\u00a0 assigned the following errors:<br\/><blockquote>\"1.\u00a0 The Court of Land Registration erred in holding that the land which is the subject matter of the application is the same as that\u00a0 referred to in the original title of ownership, Exhibit C, presented by the applicants; and in declaring that they are entitled to have issued to them a certificate of title.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 The Court of Land Registration erred in holding to be proven that the applicants and their predecessors in interest have been in possession of the land which is the subject matter of the application for the time and in the manner prescribed in subsection 6 of section 54 of Act No. 926.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 The Court of Land Registration erred in decreeing adjudication\u00a0 and registry of the land in question in the applicants' favor.\"<\/blockquote>The other opponents, Florentino Castaneda and his sisters, made the following assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"1.\u00a0 In holding in the judgment appealed from, as a finding of fact, that Saturnino Capunu's land was divided between the brothers, Hilario Casta\u00f1eda, predecessor in interest of the applicants, and Manuel Castaneda, predecessor in interest of the private opponents;<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 In admitting the alteration maliciously made by the applicants in the true boundaries of the land of their predecessor in interest, Hilario Castaneda;<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 In decreeing adjudication and registry of a tract of land of more than 254\u00a0 hectares, despite the\u00a0 definite and conclusive testimony of Hilario Castaneda that the land he sold to the applicants was only that set forth in his title, Exhibit C, as of 23 hectares and a fraction; and<br\/><br\/>\"4. In not sustaining\u00a0 the\u00a0 opposition of the private opponents as owners of the 231 hectares over, with right to register them, as they asked in their written opposition.\"<\/blockquote>With special reference to the assignments of error, an examination of the record brought to this court develops some very strange facts:<br\/><br\/>(1) We find that the plaintiffs claim title, according to the petition presented in the Court of Land Registration, to 254 hectares 12 ares and 84 centiares.<br\/><br\/>(2) In support of their right to have said land registered, they\u00a0 present two documents, Exhibits B and C.\u00a0 Exhibit B is a public document and purports to be a conveyance of the land in question by Hilario Casta\u00f1eda to the plaintiffs and bears date of 21st of August, 1905.\u00a0 Exhibit C is a document representing a <i>composicion con el Estado<\/i>, issued to Hilario Casta\u00f1eda on the 7th day of December, 1892, and is represented to be a description of the same land.<br\/><br\/>(3) While the right of the plaintiffs to have said land registered is based primarily upon Exhibits B and C, we And that their petition filed in the court below is for the registration of 254 hectares 12 ares and 84 centiares.\u00a0 Exhibit B represents the said parcel of land to contain 281 hectares 5 ares and 27 centiares.\u00a0 Exhibit C represents that said parcel of land contains 23 hectares 11 ares and 12 centiares.\u00a0 But little explanation is offered by the plaintiffs for this variation in the extent of the land in question.<br\/><br\/>(4) Not only is there a marked difference in the amount of land claimed by the plaintiffs, as indicated by their petition and said Exhibits B and C, but we find\u00a0 also that the description of the land in said documents is different and it seems impossible to harmonize the difference, both as to the amount and the description of the land which the plaintiffs claim.<br\/><br\/>(5) The deed of conveyance from Hilario Casta\u00f1eda was executed and delivered to the plaintiffs on the 21st day of August, 1905.\u00a0 The plan of the land in question presented on behalf of the plaintiffs was prepared by J. R. Waldroop on the 6th of October, 1906.\u00a0 Even though the survey of the land in question made by one of the plaintiffs after they had become the owners of the land contains nearly 27 hectares less than they had purchased from Hilario Casta\u00f1eda, the record contains nothing which shows that any objection whatever had been made with reference to said shortage.<br\/><br\/>(6) The opponents, Florentino Casta\u00f1eda and his sisters, attempt to show that a portion of the land in question belonged to them by inheritance from their father, Manuel Casta\u00f1eda.\u00a0 In relation to this contention of said opponents, it is worthy of note:<br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>)\u00a0 That Manuel Castaneda and Hilario Casta\u00f1eda were brothers.<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 That Manuel and Hilario, on the same day (the 7th of December, 1892, Exhibits C and E), by a <i>composicion con el Estado<\/i>, each acquired a parcel of land situated in the sitio of Dingding, pueblo of Capas, Province of Tarlac.<br\/><br\/>(<i>c<\/i>)\u00a0 That according to the description given in said <i>composicion<\/i> (Exhibits C and E), said parcels of land adjoined, the one of Hilario being immediately north of that acquired by Manuel.<br\/><br\/>During the trial Waldroop testified that he surveyed the land in question and prepared the plan which was presented in the Court of\u00a0 Land Registration (see Record, page 6); that Antonio Casta\u00f1eda (a brother of Hilario and Manuel) assisted him in said survey and pointed out the land which he had purchased from Hilario; that the only evidence that he had of the boundaries of the land which he had purchased from Hilario (Exhibit B) was obtained from Antonio Casta\u00f1eda at the time of the survey; that Hilario Casta\u00f1eda did\u00a0 not point out the boundaries of the land nor assist in the survey.<br\/><br\/>Antonio Casta\u00f1eda appeared as a witness at the trial of the cause and testified that he did assist Waldroop at the beginning of the survey; that he did attempt to point out the land which belonged to Hilario and which had been sold to Waldroop; that when he discovered that Waldroop was attempting to include in the survey more land than had been sold by his\u00a0 brother Hilario, he refused to continue assisting in said survey and withdrew.\u00a0 (See Record, pp. 136 and\u00a0 137.)\u00a0 It appears from the record\u00a0 that Antonio was familiar with the\u00a0 lands which had been acquired by his brothers,\u00a0 Hilario and Manuel.\u00a0 It appears also that there was no natural boundary between the two parcels of land belonging to the two brothers, Hilario and Manuel.\u00a0 It appears from the <i>composicion con el Estado<\/i>, which the brothers, Hilario and Manuel, obtained from the Government on the same day, that the land of Manuel was immediately south of the parcel of land belonging to Hilario.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the fact that at the time Waldroop made his survey, his attention was called to the fact that he was including more land than belonged to Hilario, we have the sworn statement of Hilario Castaneda himself that he did not sell to the plaintiffs\u00a0 more land than was included in his <i>composicion con el Estado<\/i>, or the amount of 23 hectares 11 ares and 12 centiares.\u00a0 It will be noted also that while the deed of sale (Exhibit B) by Hilario Casta\u00f1eda to the plaintiffs represents the lands of Manuel Casta\u00f1eda as a portion of the southern boundary, the plan presented by the plaintiffs makes no such representation.<br\/><br\/>The record contains no proof that the land which Hilario Casta\u00f1eda obtained from the Government on the 7th day of December, 1892 (Exhibit C), and which is the only land sold by him to the plaintiffs, had any natural boundaries sufficient to definitely\u00a0 identify and segregate it from the adjoining lands.\u00a0 In the absence\u00a0 of such segregation by natural boundaries, it is difficult to understand how the petitioners can claim more land than their vendor had sold to them.\u00a0 There\u00a0 is no proof that Hilario Casta\u00f1eda had acquired more land in the place named than that which he had acquired from the State.\u00a0 (Exhibit C.)<br\/><br\/>In order that natural boundaries of land may be accepted for the purpose of varying the extent of the land included in a deed of conveyance, the evidence as to such natural boundaries must be\u00a0 clear and convincing.\u00a0 Such natural boundaries must be of such a character as to definitely and accurately segregate the land in question from the adjoining property.\u00a0 There\u00a0 must be no doubt left\u00a0 that the land included within the natural boundaries is the same land which was intended to be sold by the deed of conveyance.\u00a0 In the present case it appears positively that Hilario Castaneda sold to the petitioners only the land which he had obtained from the Government on the 7th day of December, 1892.\u00a0 By reference to the deed of conveyance by the Government to Hilario Casta\u00f1eda (Exhibit C) we find that the Government conveyed to him 23 hectares 11 ares and 12 centiares only.\u00a0 The record shows affirmatively that Hilario Casta\u00f1eda sold to the petitioners only the land which he had obtained from the Government and no more.\u00a0 In the absence of proof\u00a0 that the land which Hilario Casta\u00f1eda had obtained from the Government had natural boundaries sufficient to clearly segregate it from the adjoining lands to identify it as a parcel of land separate from other parcels, we must hold, under the proof, that the only land which the plaintiffs own is the land which Hilario Castaneda had obtained from the Spanish Government on the 7th day of December, 1892, or 23 hectares 11 ares and 12 centiares.\u00a0 (Pamintuan <i>vs<\/i>.

MIGUEL ESTRADA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>PER CURIAM:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\"> This is a prosecution for frustrated rape.\u00a0 The court found the accused guilty of attempted rape committed without either aggravating or extenuating circumstances and sentenced him to two years four months and one day of <i>prision correccional<\/i> with the accessories provided by law and the payment of the costs.<br\/><br\/>The evidence of the prosecution establishes that on Sunday, the 28th of August, 1910, Teodorica Jarantilla, a young girl 14 years of age, was in company with her mother at their tienda in a cockpit in the municipality of Bay, Province of Laguna, where she\u00a0 had been during the forenoon; that between the hours of 12 and 2 in the afternoon she went to her house for her midday meal; that after having eaten, in company with her sister, Eulogia Jarantilla, she started to return to the tienda where her mother still was; that just at that moment a\u00a0 neighbor, Juana Geirosa, called to her to go to her house and get a camisa which Juana had made for her; that Teodorica replied that she would go and get it later, but as Juana urged her strongly, pretending that she and her husband had to go away, Teodorica believed that it was necessary to go to Juana's house for the purpose indicated by Juana; that on arriving at the house Teodorica found Juana and her husband, Julian Tarrega, eating their midday meal in the lower part of the house; that upon the request of Juana, Teodorica went into the house to get the camisa, which according to Juana would be found on a <i>lancape<\/i>; that as she was attempting to leave the house the accused came from one of the\u00a0 interior rooms, seized her by the hand, turned her around and grasped her from the rear; that thereupon a struggle ensued between the two; that while she was struggling to loosen herself from the grasp of the accused she cried to him asking why he was treating her thus; that he thereupon answered that if she did not yield herself to his desires and purposes (naming: them) he would kill her and would then himself become a bandit; that Teodorica refused to accede to his requests, whereupon the accused lifted up her clothes and sought to throw her to the floor, but she succeeded in grasping a bamboo post which was near by, thus preventing herself from being thrown while she held her skirts between her legs; that during this time she was crying for help and although the accused pinched her throat in order to prevent her using her voice, her sister, Eulogia, who by means of signs and gesticulations, was called by Marcela Espinosa and her son,\u00a0 Demetrio, heard Teodorica's cries for help and immediately ran to the place, finding the accused still embracing Teodorica; that the accused observing the presence of Eulogia let loose of Teodorica and started to run; that as a result of the struggle Teodorica's camisa was badly torn.<br\/><br\/>These facts were found established by the court who tried the cause.\u00a0 The evidence of the prosecution, however, is vigorously attacked by counsel for the appellant.\u00a0 The first error assigned, under cover of which the attack begins, is to the effect that, \"the\u00a0 court erred in finding that Exhibit' No. 9 was void, having been obtained from Jarantilla by misrepresentation and fraud.\"\u00a0 To understand the nature of this assignment of error it is necessary to know that Florentino Jarantilla, who figures in Exhibit No. 9, is the father of Teodorica and is the person who made the complaint against the accused upon which this prosecution proceeds.\u00a0 Exhibit No. 9 is an affidavit which Jarantilla is alleged to have made before the justice of the peace who had before him the preliminary\u00a0 investigation of the crime which the accused is alleged to have committed, in which Jarantilla states that he has no evidence and can procure no evidence against the accused relative to the crime of frustrated violation and asks for a dismissal of the action against the accused for that reason.\u00a0 Upon this affidavit the justice of the peace dismissed the proceedings and discharged the accused; whereupon the case was taken up by the provincial fiscal and the information filed in the Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>Jarantilla asserts that the affidavit in question was obtained from\u00a0 him by false representation and deceit.\u00a0 He claims that he was asked to go to the house of the justice of the peace before whom the preliminary investigation against the accused in this case was pending relative to an adjournment of a case pending before the same justice of the peace in which Jarantilla was accused of the crime of threatening the life of Juana Geirosa and Julian Tarrega.\u00a0 He says that, upon arriving at the house of the justice of the peace, he was informed that in order to obtain an adjournment of his case it would be necessary for him to sign a paper to that effect.\u00a0 A paper was thereupon written out in Spanish and he signed the same without, as he claims, knowing its contents, he being unable to read the Spanish language and the document having been interpreted to him in such a manner as completely to deceive him as to its real contents.\u00a0 Upon these facts the learned trial court found that Jarantilla's signature to the instrument in question had been obtained by false representations and decided that it was therefore of no significance in the present case.<br\/><br\/>Jarantilla's statements' relative to the manner in which said document was obtained are vigorously denied by the persons interested and their testimony directly contradicts such allegations.\u00a0 The court below, who had the opportunity to observe the witnesses while they were testifying and their manner and conduct during the course of the trial, found in favor of Jarantilla, thereby in effect manifesting his disbelief in the testimony presented by such witnesses.\u00a0 After a thorough examination of this case we do not feel justified in disturbing this conclusion.\u00a0 It does not appear that any material fact or circumstance was overlooked by the trial court in arriving at the\u00a0 conclusion which he reached.<br\/><br\/>The second error assigned is to the effect that \"the court erred in finding that the\u00a0 acts proved on the trial constitute the crime of attempted rape.\" In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Banzon we held in substance that, \"where it appears that the accused\u00a0 seized the complaining witness and attempted to throw her upon the ground under circumstances showing a purpose to forcibly ravish her, but desists upon the approach of persons attracted by the woman's screams, the offense is attempted rape.\"\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Banzon, 1 Phil. Rep., 435.)\u00a0 That case has been followed many times by this court.\u00a0 The facts proved in the case at bar bring it clearly within that case as well as within the definition of the Penal Code which says that, \"there is an attempt when the offender commences the commission of the felony directly by overt acts and does not perform all of the acts of execution which constitute the felony by reason of some cause or accident other than his own voluntary desistance.\"<br\/><br\/>We appreciate to the full the very strong and able argument made by counsel for the appellant relative to the unreasonableness of the claim that the accused attempted to violate Teodorica in broad daylight, in a community that was thickly settled and hear a public highway and substantially in the presence of Julian Tarrega and Juana Geirosa, his wife.\u00a0 It is the one very strong circumstance in favor of the accused.\u00a0 As against it, however, we have the direct evidence of Teodorica herself, of her sister and a number of other witnesses.\u00a0 The commission of the\u00a0 crime at the place, at the time, and in the manner charged is not impossible and, although the charge that it was so committed may be unreasonable, still such unreasonableness may be overcome by the direct and positive testimony of unimpeachable witnesses.\u00a0 From the evidence before him the learned trial court found that the witnesses for the prosecution were telling the truth in their relation of the story of the case and that the facts occurred substantially as they stated them.\u00a0 We have held on many occasions that \"this court will not interfere with the intelligent conclusion of a trial court concerning the credibility of witnesses, the court having seen the witnesses in the act of testifying and having carefully observed their manner and demeanor as witnesses, unless the record discloses that some fact or circumstance of weight and influence has either been overlooked by the court or has been misapprehended or misinterpreted.\"\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Ambrosio, 17 Phil. Rep,, 295.)<br\/><br\/>It is true that on several occasions this court has held the testimony in cases of this character insufficient to justify the conviction of the accused and has reversed the judgment of conviction.\u00a0 In each of these cases, however, there were, independent of the direct testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution and independent of the place where the crime was alleged to have been committed, facts and circumstances of weight\u00a0 and influence which went directly to the credibility of the witnesses and which had been overlooked by the trial court in his appreciation of their testimony.\u00a0 In the case at bar we find nothing which goes directly to the credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution apart from the fact of the time and place of the commission of the crime.\u00a0 No prior or subsequent acts or conduct on their part have been shown which in any way militate against the credibility of those witnesses.\u00a0 The mere unreasonableness founded upon the time and place of the commission of the crime must yield to the direct and positive testimony of credible witnesses whom the court has seen and whose declarations he believes.<br\/><br\/>Concluding\u00a0 the discussion of this phase of the case we cannot do better than present the ideas which were dominant in the mind of the trial court when considering this very subject.\u00a0 He said:<br\/><blockquote>\"At first sight the existence of this crime appears unreasonable as well as imaginary.\u00a0 The place of its commission is one of the most central places in the municipality of Bay, in a house which is not far from that of the complaining witness, and is not very far from the public market and from the cockpit, in both of which places ordinarily are found many people and especially so on the day in question, which was market day.\u00a0 This house with many others form a row of houses upon one side of the street while upon the other side is another similar row of houses.\u00a0 The hour is just after midday; the occasion a lunch being taken by the two occupants of the house.\u00a0 Inspite of this, however, upon examination of all the facts and circumstances which surround the crime, the character and conduct of the accused, his influence and his power in the village as justice of the\u00a0 peace and the conditions in which the persons who lived in the house at the time the crime was committed found themselves, the conclusion follows that the crime was in fact committed in the manner established by the evidence of the prosecution.\u00a0 There could not have been as much travel in the street upon which the house in which the crime was committed fronted as there was in Calle Real, from which it branches.\u00a0 The municipality of Bay is one of the fourth class and therefore of small population.\u00a0 On Sunday, which was the day on which the crime was committed, there could not have been much traffic.\u00a0 It was not the hour in which ordinarily people gather at the market, while the cockpit was at a considerable distance.\u00a0 Even in populous cities, for example, in\u00a0 Manila, during the hour indicated, the travel in the streets is notably\u00a0 diminished, if it does not cease entirely.\u00a0 The stores below and in\u00a0 front of the houses are also closed.\u00a0 Estrada, one of the residents of this village since his birth, knew these conditions and knew at the same time that Teodorica and her parents were in the cockpit.\u00a0 He took advantage of the hour and of the occasion in which Teodorica, coming home for her luncheon, would be separated from her parents.\u00a0 The window of the house in which the crime was committed which opens upon the street was closed, while the dining room is in the lower part of the house at the side of the steps by which the upper story is reached.\u00a0 The presence of Julian and of his wife, Juana, was of no significance; these were his dependents and accomplices; the matter\u00a0 was previously arranged between them and instead of interfering with him he counted upon their aid and protection.\u00a0 This explains why Juana, in spite of being at table, left her seat and went to call Teodorica, using as a pretext therefor the camisa which she was making for her; and this explains also why Julian and Juana in spite of the fact that they were present did nothing in order to prevent the commission of the crime.\u00a0 It results, then, that the house in question as the place selected by Estrada to sacrifice the honor of Teodorica was most secure; that the occasion\u00a0 was also the most propitious for the realization of his immoral purposes, and that the\u00a0 presence of other persons, they being his dependents and accomplices, assured rather than interfered with the commission of the crime.\"<\/blockquote>Referring to the influence which the accused exercised over Julian Tarrega and his wife, Juana Geirosa, as partial explanation of why the accused committed the crime substantially in their presence, the trial court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Neither can the testimony of the mother of the accused destroy the force of the testimony of Julian Tarrega and Juana Geirosa.\u00a0 Tarrega and Geirosa, laborer and dressmaker, respectively, prior to\u00a0 the commission of the crime lived in a small house situated in one of\u00a0 the streets of the municipality of Bay.\u00a0 From what has been said above it will be remembered that this poor couple were dependents of Estrada and his accomplices in the commission of the crime charged.\u00a0 It must now be said that immediately after the commission of the crime Estrada required these two to leave their house and to live in his.\u00a0 To accomplish this he used his sister, Basilia Pacheco, who frightened them by telling them that they were\u00a0 accused of crime before the acting justice of the peace.\u00a0 The couple lived in Estrada's house for about two months and Estrada, under the pretext of protecting them, held them\u00a0 prisoners without permitting them to leave the house.\u00a0 It was at that time also when Estrada, aided by his acting justice of the peace, Ijares, by means of force and threats, obtained from the couple affidavits in his\u00a0 favor which he now pretends to use in his defense, his object being without doubt to be sure that nobody would be able to get\u00a0 anything from these persons relative to the crime.\u00a0 Estrada later sent Julian and Juana to Tansa, a small village in the municipality of Cavite, and there they were guarded and\u00a0 watched by Basilia Pacheco, sister of Estrada.\u00a0 Later they escaped, and from that moment dates the persecution to which Estrada subjected them.\u00a0 In spite of their having been placed under the protection of the fiscal in Laguna and later of their lawyer, Sr. Cruz Herrera, in Manila, they were later charged with adultery before Estrada as justice of the peace and he required of them an excessive bail, evidently for the purpose of depriving them of their liberty.\u00a0 Finally Estrada and his mother, who were the sureties given\u00a0 by Julian and Juana upon the charge of being accomplices of Estrada in the crime of attempted rape, withdrew the bond, leaving them exposed to the imprisonment which they thereafter suffered, they being arrested by reason of the withdrawal of the bail bond.\u00a0 The testimony of these persons is that which Estrada and his mother seek to overthrow; but the court finds no reason whatever to believe the mother of the accused rather than Julian and his wife.\u00a0 To do so would be equivalent to putting Estrada's case in the hands of his own mother for decision, which would naturally result in the acquittal of her son.\"<\/blockquote>The facts and circumstances presented in these quotations are founded, generally speaking, on clear evidence of the prosecution and furnish sufficient corroboration of the direct testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution to destroy the contention of the defense based upon the unreasonableness of the claim\u00a0 that a man of Estrada's intelligence would commit a crime under the circumstances charged in the information.<br\/><br\/>The fourth error assigned (the third being discussed in connection with\u00a0 the\u00a0 fifth and sixth) is to the effect that \"the court erred in finding that the mother of the accused was not a competent witness simply on account of the fact that she was the mother of the accused.\"<br\/><br\/>In reference to this error it should be noted that the mother was permitted to testify and her evidence appears in the record in this case.\u00a0 All that the trial court did was to refuse to give it weight in connection with the defense.\u00a0 While this may possibly be regarded as error it is not a prejudicial error unless the evidence\u00a0 of the mother was of such a nature that, taken in connection with the other testimony of the defense, it would have a very important, if not decisive, bearing.\u00a0 In other words, such error cannot be ground for reversal unless it really prejudiced the substantial rights of the\u00a0 accused.\u00a0 The testimony given by the mother while material and competent was rather cumulative than otherwise and\u00a0 would not have seriously influenced the general result if the court had considered it in the same way in which he considered the other testimony for the defense.\u00a0 The legal situation, then, is not the same as if the court had refused to permit the mother to testify.\u00a0 That would have been clear error and might have been reversible, depending upon\u00a0 all the facts and circumstances presented by the record.\u00a0 The fact, however, that she did testify and that her testimony was considered\u00a0 by the court to the extent of his refusing to believe\u00a0 it as true presents the case in a light which shows that the action of the court does not merit the criticism made by the defense.<br\/><br\/>The third, fifth and sixth errors, considered together by the appellant, are respectively that \"the court erred in giving preponderance to the evidence of the prosecution over that of the defense;\" that \"the\u00a0 court erred in finding the accused guilty of the crime of frustrated rape;\" and that \"the court erred in not acquitting the accused.\"<br\/><br\/>Under this group of alleged errors counsel for the appellant very thoroughly discusses the\u00a0 whole evidence in the case, pointing out what he claims to be serious contradictions on the part of the principal witness of the prosecution, and calling attention to the inconsistencies and weaknesses in general of the evidence of the prosecution.\u00a0 He dwells at length upon the lack of evidence corroborating the testimony of Teodorica, citing the doctrine that an accused may not be convicted of rape upon the uncorroborated testimony of the female alleged to have been violated.\u00a0 In connection with the various points raised and arguments made by counsel under this group of alleged errors the trial court said: <br\/><blockquote>\"The testimony of Teodorica Jarantilla is corroborated in every part by \nthe testimony of the other witnesses of the prosecution.\u00a0 Eulogia \nJarantilla says that at midday of the day in question, after having \nlunched with her Sister, the latter left the house to return to the \ncockpit; that a few moments later Eulogia was called\u00a0 by her neighbors, \nan old lady called Marcela and her son, who asked her where Teodorica \nwas, and hardly had she answered this question when she heard the cries \nof her sister, whereupon she went to Juana's house, opened the door and \nentered; that she found Miguel Estrada embracing Teodorica; that when \nEstrada noticed her presence he loosed Teodorica and left the house, \npassing out by way of the <i>batalan<\/i>.\u00a0 Eulogia also says that on \nseeing what had happened to her sister she complained to the owners of \nthe house asking them, among other things, why they had permitted this \nto be done to her sister.\u00a0 Eulogia recognized Exhibit A\u00a0 as the same \ncamisa which her sister wore at the time and which had been torn in the \nstruggle, and finally stated that they returned to their house for the \npurpose of permitting Teodorica to arrange her hair and to get a <i>pa\u00f1olon<\/i>\n with which to cover up her torn camisa.\u00a0 Marcela Espinosa, another \nwitness for the prosecution, testified that while in her house she heard\n sounds in the interior of the house of her neighbor, Juana Geirosa, \nsimilar to those which would be made by persons fighting; that a few \nmoments afterward Juana came and told Marcela what had happened, saying \nto her, 'What am I going to do, because the justice of the peace,\u00a0 \nMiguel Estrada, is in my house violating Teodorica;' that then the \nwitness went to Juana's house and opening the <i>dindin<\/i> a little \nways saw that Miguel had hold of Teodorica and that she had seized hold \nof one of the posts of the wall.\u00a0 Pedro Dilla, another witness for the \nprosecution, also a neighbor living very near the house where the crime \nwas committed, says that while he was lying down in his tienda to rest \nhe heard sounds which were caused by a quarrel or a fight which was \ntaking place in Juana's house; that because of this noise he saw Marcela\n and her son, Demetrio, call to a woman who afterwards turned out to be \nEulogia Jarantilla, whom after she had entered Juana's house he heard \ncomplaining or finding fault, and finally, the noise having ceased, he \nsaw Miguel Estrada come from the house by the rear.<br\/><br\/>\"Such is the direct evidence of the prosecution.\u00a0 Besides this there exists in the record other evidence which demonstrates indirectly the commission of the crime and the guilt of the accused.\u00a0 Said indirect proofs are: First, the accused, Miguel Estrada, about the month of January or February, 1911, that is\u00a0 to say, while this cause was pending in the Court of First Instance, induced Nicasio Villegas, a resident of the municipality of Los Ba\u00f1os, to make\u00a0 use of his friendship with Sr. Cruz Herrera, then attorney for the complaining witness in this case, and write him a letter asking him to interest himself in Estrada's favor, and that he should say that he was an uncle of Estrada, although in reality he was not, and that he should induce the said lawyer to approach Teodorica's father for the purpose of securing a settlement of the case.\u00a0 Estrada later, in company with Villegas, went to the office of lawyer Herrera in Manila and there the accused\u00a0 personally asked if the case could not be settled.\u00a0 In the second place, the accused, Estrada, about the month of January or February, 1911, repeatedly sought to induce his neighbor and then\u00a0 friend, Francisco L. Cruz, president of Bay, as said president, to influence the mind of Florentino Jarantilla, a\u00a0 member of the municipal council, to the end that a settlement of the rape case be obtained; and Estrada not being able to obtain the assistance asked for threatened Francisco L. Cruz, saying, 'If you do not settle this case I will do everything in my power to get you in jail,' he referring by these words to the complaints which later were the cause of an administrative investigation against said president of the village and four councilmen, one of whom was Florentino Jarantilla; and, third, the said Estrada, making use of his lawyer, Soriano, and of other persons who aided him, took advantage of the ignorance of Florentino Jarantilla, inducing him to sign a motion which they represented to him to be a petition for the adjournment of a criminal case in which he was defendant, when in reality and in truth said motion was one for the dismissal of the case against Estrada upon the ground that the affiant had no proofs to sustain his accusation, but later this stratagem of the accused will be again referred to.\u00a0 For the present it is sufficient to say that the prosecution has justified by abundant proof, direct as well as indirect, the commission of the crime and the guilt of the accused.\"<\/blockquote>In another place in the opinion the trial court says, referring to the testimony of the accused in which he gives his version of the alleged occurrence:<br\/><blockquote>\"Estrada's foregoing explanation is false in every particular.\u00a0 Julian and Juana say that they did not invite Estrada to eat in their house on that day; that Estrada came to the house alone and was not accompanied by Lucio Lanet; and finally that Eulogia Jarantilla, although enraged at all of them for what had happened to her sister, did not strike her with her slippers or address to her the words which Estrada attributes to her.\u00a0 The words referred to could not have been used by Eulogia, they referring to the alleged love relations between Estrada and Teodorica, for the reason that, according to Estrada himself, such relations were not known to Eulogia nor to her parents at that time, and especially as he did not, according to his own contention, speak of his relations with Teodorica in the presence of the members of her family.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 Relative to his relations with Teodorica, Estrada not only asserts that his love for her was returned by Teodorica, but that he had declared such love and had been accepted, and he makes reference to certain facts which indicate that Teodorica was his concubine.\u00a0 The scene in the river Sabang where, according to Estrada's story, he\u00a0 washed her hair and she washed his in the presence of Eulogia Jarantilla and of an old woman is imaginary and\u00a0 false.\u00a0 The card which Estrada says he received from Teodorica through a confidant of his is in reality a card\u00a0 manufactured by Estrada with Teodorica's name printed upon it and is not her card; she herself says that it was not and that she had never had a card and had never written the words that appear on said card.\u00a0 The measure which Estrada says was the size of one of Teodorica's feet, taken by her herself and delivered to him in order that he might buy her some shoes in Manila, of itself proves the falsity of Estrada's excuses.\u00a0 He himself presented such measure as evidence, but when it was placed upon Teodorica's foot it was found to be several inches, too large.\u00a0 Estrada speaks of a suit of woman's clothes (camisa, pa\u00f1uelo, and skirt) which he said he had ordered made as a present for Teodorica for her to wear on his birthday, and presented in evidence as an exhibit a camisa which he said was\u00a0 furnished by Teodorica herself to serve as a pattern or model for the making of the wearing apparel referred to; but it was found on trying on the camisa that it was very much too small for Teodorica and therefore could not have served as a pattern.\u00a0 This camisa, then, proves once more the artifices to which Estrada resorted in order to defend himself at all hazards.\u00a0 Relative to the two love letters which he says he received from Teodorica and which he kept in his possession, it may be said that such letters never existed and were never written by Teodorica to Estrada.\u00a0 It is strange that Estrada's wife, having discovered and torn up said letters, did not also discover the card above referred to and tear it up as well as the letters, or that she did not discover Teodorica's camisa, which at the same time defendant claims was in his possession.\u00a0 It is impossible to believe the story relative to the amorous relations to which Estrada alludes.\u00a0 He is a widower and married a second time, with five children, with whom Teodorica has been acquainted since she was very\u00a0 young.\u00a0 She herself was at the time engaged to Tranquilino Arieta, a young student about to conclude his course in pharmacy, to whom she had been promised in marriage by her parents.\u00a0 She was on the eve of being married to him\u00a0 and the marriage waited only upon the termination of his course in college.\u00a0 In spite of all this Estrada tries to\u00a0 make us believe that Teodorica Jarantilla is his <i>querida<\/i>.\u00a0 In the opinion of the court Estrada in arriving at this point in his allegations no longer seeks to defend himself, but feeling himself overwhelmed by the wave of evidence of the prosecution appears to say to himself:\u00a0 'Inasmuch as I am to fall anyway I am going to call her my <i>querida<\/i> in order that the reputation of this woman shall fall forever with me to the ground.\"<\/blockquote>Referring to the\u00a0 contradictions which the appellant attempts to\u00a0 point out in the testimony given by Teodorica in the preliminary investigation before the justice of the peace and that given on the trial in the Court of First Instance, the trial court says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The testimony of Ijares, in which he asserts that in the preliminary investigation Teodorica Jarantilla testified that she had been scolded and beaten by her sister Eulogia, is denied by Teodorica upon the one hand\u00a0 and upon the other we already know what kind of a witness Ijares is, but we will add the following: Ijares, according to Pantua, did not take notes of the testimony in the preliminary investigation.\u00a0 Ijares did not know how to write out correctly in Spanish the declarations of the witnesses and much less to make extracts from them.\u00a0 In this case the said Ijares upon the plea that he preferred his own dialect refused to testify in Spanish, and for that reason the fiscal required him to write in the exhibit the declaration he had made.\u00a0 From the time the fiscal began his cross-examination Ijares began to have a severe attack of coughing so persistent that he could hardly be understood even in his own language.\u00a0 This very exhibit demonstrates that Ijares could not have been the author of a report or extract of the declarations taken in the preliminary investigation, which are now sought to be used as evidence to convict Teodorica of having previously made contradictory statements.\"<\/blockquote>We are satisfied from a careful examination of the evidence and of the record that the facts stated by the trial court in the quotations just made are in the main supported by the evidence of the prosecution and the conclusions which he draws from such facts are in general justified.\u00a0 Much can be said on behalf of the defense, as the case was fiercely fought and\u00a0 the\u00a0 defense prepared with care and patience.<br\/><br\/>On this appeal the defense has been again prepared with skill and argued with ability.\u00a0 Nevertheless, upon the whole case we are constrained to the conclusion that the defendant has been proved guilty of the crime of attempted rape beyond reasonable doubt and that the judgment and sentence against him should be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>The judgment is affirmed, with costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Martinez, established in this city, brought suit against Jose Moreno, the judicial administrator of the estate of the deceased German Lopez Vivar, a resident of San Isidro, Nueva Ecija.\u00a0 The complaint alleged that, about the month of August, 1892, Luengo Hermanos, a mercantile partnership, of which the said firm of Luengo &amp; Martinez are the successors, granted to and opened for the said Lopez Vivar, now deceased, a credit of P2,500 which the latter, as concessioner, was empowered to use in such extent and manner as might best suit his convenience, he being authorized, whenever he should exhaust the amount of this credit and while he was repaying it, to have such credit renewed for a sum equal to\u00a0 the unpaid balance of the original amount; that this contract was set forth in an instrument executed before a notary public on the date aforementioned; that it was therein further stipulated that if the concessioner, Lopez Vivar, should avail himself of all or a part of the said credit and six months should elapse without his remitting or paying any sum not less than P500 to the creditor firm, the total sum found to be owing the said firm should thereupon become immediately demandable, that, as security for such credit allowed, Lopez Vivar gave a special mortgage, recorded in the property registry, on two rural properties described in the aforementioned instrument, the first of which, containing 42 <i>qui\u00f1ones<\/i>, 4 <i>balitas<\/i> and 1 <i>loan<\/i>, was made liable for Pl,300,\u00a0 and the second, having an area of 92 hectares, 54 ares, and 42 centiares, for P1,200; that Lopez Vivar made use of the said credit and, upon a settlement being made of his account current, a balance was found against him\u00a0 and in favor of the creditor firm, of P2,300.62; that since the said date, March 18th, the debtor had not remitted or paid in any sum; that the latter,was during his lifetime several times requested to pay the said balance, which payment he did not make, notwithstanding his promises so to do, and that he died owing the amount demanded.\u00a0 The complaint prayed that the judge order the said administrator to deposit the aforementioned unpaid balance with the clerk of the court, at the disposal of the creditor firm, before the first day of the term of court immediately following the date of the rendition of judgment; that, should payment thereof not be made, the mortgaged properties be sold to satisfy the said debt of P2,300.62, and the interest thereon, and that the costs of the case be assessed against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendant, in his amended answer, made a general and specific denial of each and all of the facts alleged in each and all the\u00a0 paragraphs of the complaint, with the exception of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 thereof, and in special defense set forth that the sum of P2,500, Philippine currency, which was the amount of the credit allowed by the plaintiffs' predecessors in interest to the deceased German Lopez Vivar, expressly secured by a mortgage, had already been totally paid; that the balance disclosed in the account current, a copy of which accompanied the complaint, was an obligation of the deceased which had prescribed, inasmuch as it had not been\u00a0 presented as such before the commissioners of appraisal by the plaintiff creditor within the period fixed by the court to hear claims, wherefore the plaintiff firm had lost its right to enforce payment of the amount demanded, as the said period had already elapsed.\u00a0 Defendant's counsel prayed, therefore, in view of the evidence supporting the aforestated allegations, that judgment be rendered by absolving his client from the complaint and sentencing the plaintiff to the costs.<br\/><br\/>Upon a hearing of the case and submission of evidence by both parties, the judgment before mentioned was rendered.<br\/><br\/>The main issue in discussion in this suit is whether the debt of P2,300.62 is one of a hypothecary character and whether its payment is still secured by the mortgage on the property described in the instrument of debt.<br\/><br\/>Before examining the nature and terms of the contract contained in the said\u00a0 instrument, it is appropriate and necessary to quote some of its principal and relevant clauses:<br\/><blockquote>\"That as such partner authorized to use the signature of the partnership known as Luengo Hermanos, he grants to Don German Lopez\u00a0 Vivar a credit of P2,500, which the said firm will open for the latter for an unlimited period and which the concessioner may use in such extent and manner as may best suit his convenience, and when he shall have exhausted the total amount of the said credit and while\u00a0 repaying it he shall be entitled to have such credit renewed for a sum equal to the unpaid balance of the original amount.<br\/><br\/>\"That if the concessioner, Lopez Vivar, shall avail himself of all or a part of the said credit of P2,500 and six months shall elapse without his remitting any sum not less than P500, the total sum found to be owing by him to the said firm shall thereupon become due, and the obligation of payment effective, for all the legal purposes of this contract which shall be fulfilled in this city of Manila.<br\/><br\/>\"Don German Lopez Vivar, in turn, stipulates:\u00a0 That he accepts this instrument in each and all of its parts and binds himself in the most solemn manner to pay such amount as in future he may be found to be owing the firm of Luengo Hermanos by reason of the credit allowed him, and further agrees to comply with and abide by all the stipulations hereinbefore contained; and, as additional security for his compliance with the said obligation, he specially and expressly mortgages in favor of the said firm two rural properties belonging to him and hereinafter described.<br\/><br\/>\"That the two said properties are mortgaged for the said P2,500, the amount of the credit opened for and allowed Don German Lopez Vivar, the first\u00a0 of which shall be liable for P1,300, and the second, for Pl,200, and both of them shall remain so encumbered as long as the present contract subsists and until the firm of Luengo Hermanos shall execute the proper instrument of settlement of accounts and acquittance; and that the said Vivar shall, besides, be personally and solely liable for all costs and expenses that may originate from any failure on his part to comply with the provisions of this instrument.\"<\/blockquote>The\u00a0 credit allowed for an indefinite period of time appears to be limited solely to the amount of P2,500, a sum specifically secured by a mortgage on two properties belonging to the debtor; however, by reason of the importance of the business between the latter and the creditor firm, the value of the merchandise and money obtained and received from the said firm caused the debt to fluctuate and at times to reach an amount much in excess of the credit originally allowed, as appears from the account, Exhibit A, presented at the trial by the plaintiff without objection whatsoever; and, as a result of the payments made by the debtor up to March\u00a0 18, 1899, there stood against him on that date only the balance demanded in the complaint.<br\/><br\/>It is held in the judgment of the trial court that the mortgage debt has already been paid, inasmuch as, according to the account exhibited against the debtor, German Lopez Vivar, there existed on Match 19, 1898, a balance owing by him of P4,855, and deducting therefrom P2,500, which only were secured by mortgage, the remainder, P2,355.63 constitutes a simple debt, and that of the same nature are all the sums and the value of the merchandise received by Lopez Vivar after the said date, which additional amounts, together with\u00a0 the P2,355.63, aggregate the sum of P4,066.52, the latter having made remittances to the value of P4,265.90.\u00a0 In our opinion, there exists but one single debt originated by the mercantile dealings had between the deceased German Lopez Vivar and the plaintiff firm; and, although the debtor, perhaps with the consent of the creditor company, took merchandise and cash much in excess of the value of the credit secured by the mortgage, nevertheless it may not be affirmed on any reasonable ground that there exist two debts, notwithstanding that if at the debtor's death his debt had amounted to much more than P2,500, an action for foreclosure of mortgage could only have been brought for the collection of this sum, and not for a greater one, the amount of the excess of which is not secured by the mortgage of the said real estate.\u00a0 In accordance with the provisions of section 260 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the creditor is entitled to the payment of these P2,500.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 5 of those hereinabove quoted, which were copied from the instrument aforesaid, sets forth among other provisions that the encumbrance on the two mortgaged properties shall subsist as long as the contract executed between the parties shall remain in force and until the creditor firm shall execute the proper instrument of settlement of accounts and acquittance; and as, in paragraph 1, it was agreed that when the total amount of the credit allowed should be exhausted and while the debtor was repaying it, he should be entitled to have such credit renewed for a sum equal to the unpaid balance of the original amount, P2,500, it is unquestionable that, even though at any given time the sum of P2,500 fixed as the amount of the allowance may have been covered by the remittances and partial payments made by the debtor to whom such credit was extended, the value of the subsequent merchandise and sums obtained and received by the debtor, in accordance with the agreement, virtually novated or was comprised within the credit allowed which is understood to have been renewed, and is likewise secured by the mortgage of the debtor's property.\u00a0 Such new debts cannot be considered as foreign to and distinct from those that the debtor, Lopez Vivar, originally owed upon his first making use of the credit allowed him, inasmuch as, by reason of the stipulations made, the credit allowance is understood to have been renewed each time that the debtor so required.\u00a0 The account exhibited by the plaintiffs shows the kind of operations had between them and the debtor, Lopez Vivar, which consisted in the latter's getting merchandise and money from the creditor firm to whom he would make remittances and payments on account of the credit used by him.\u00a0 The debt incurred has but one source of origin.<br\/><br\/>Loans of various sums and sales of diverse merchandise on trust were made by the creditor firm to Lopez Vivar, now deceased, under promise on his part to reimburse and pay for the same in installments of not less than P500 for an undetermined period, and with the express condition that, for the very reason of the debtor's being authorized to Continue using the unexhausted balance of the credit granted him, the mortgage on his property should, in exchange, subsist as security for any balance that might lie against him as a result of the mercantile operations had between the interested parties.<br\/><br\/>Upon the death of the debtor, fortunately it was found that he owed a less amount than that of the credit allowed in the contract contained in the aforesaid legal instrument, and consequently it would be neither just nor proper to discuss here whether this amount is secured by the mortgage.<br\/><br\/>If, in accordance with the contract, the mortgage was to remain in force as security for any sum that Lopez Vivar should be found to owe,\u00a0 until the\u00a0 execution of the instrument of settlement of accounts and acquittance, which was not shown to have been executed, then it is incontrovertible that the sum demanded is still secured by the mortgage on the debtor's property, and an action for foreclosure lies.against-the said property and the estate of the deceased Lopez Vivar for the collection of the\u00a0 debt which the latter left unpaid at his death.<br\/><br\/>This debt does not appear to have been paid yet, and that it was not is fully proven by the account Exhibit A and the instrument of debt Exhibit B, presented without objection, opposition or contradiction on the part of the defendant administrator, and also by the corroborative testimony of two witnesses who affirmed the existence and certainty of the debt which German Lopez Vivar left at his death.\u00a0 In this connection it is to be noted that a few days before the debtor died, payment of the said sum was demanded of him by the witness Joaquin Navarro, to whom Lopez Vivar replied that his debt to the plaintiffs was secured by the mortgage on his\u00a0 property\u2014a statement which implies an acknowledgment of the legitimacy and certainty of the debt demanded, the existence of which is, besides, corroborated by the circumstance that the aforesaid instrument of debt, containing the mortgage therein mentioned, does not appear to have been canceled; furthermore, the defendant administrator has not in any manner proved that the balance of P2,300.62 has been paid by him or was paid by German Lopez Vivar during the latter's lifetime.<br\/><br\/>If the action brought by the plaintiff is hypothecary, for the collection of a debt secured by a mortgage, it is unquestionable that, pursuant to the provisions of section 708 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the plaintiff firm was not obliged to present its claim\u00a0 before the committee of appraisal of the estate of the deceased debtor, and in demanding the collection of its credit by means of the action mentioned, it availed itself of the right granted it by section 708 of the Code of Civil Procedure to bring the present suit for the collection of the said debt or, in default of its payment, for the sale of the mortgaged\u00a0 property.<br\/><br\/>The obligation that existed on the part of German Lopez Vivar during his lifetime, toward Luengo &amp; Martinez, consisted in the payment of the said sum of P2,300.62, the balance of the accounts had between them through mercantile transactions based on one and\u00a0 the same contract; and as both the debtor and his estate became delinquent by their failure, to pay the sum which the deceased owed the plaintiff firm, the former's estate must indemnify the said creditors for the losses and damages occasioned them by Vivar's failure to fulfill his obligation.\u00a0 There being no stipulation to the contrary, such indemnity consists in the payment of the legal interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum\u2014for no agreement was made in this matter\u2014from the 19th of March, 1899, the date following that of the balance found in the said account, Exhibit A, since it is a question of a net sum demandable from the date aforementioned.\u00a0 (Art. 1108, Civil Code, and sec. 510, Code of Civil Procedure.)<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from must be reversed and the record remanded to the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, with a certified copy of this decision, in order that the judge thereof may proceed in conformity with the law and the petition made in the complaint presented by counsel for Luengo &amp; Martinez, on August 9, 1911.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Cid y Mata, Estanislao Nicolas y Juan, and Gregorio Guerrero y Mata filed\u00a0 suit on August 1, 1908, in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte, alleging that they have been for more than twenty years the owners of a rural estate situated in Sari Julian de Culao, Dingras, Ilocos Norte, the cultivated part of which has an area of approximately 12 hectares and 50 ares, according to the compromise effected between the defendants, Abraham Peralta and Dorotea Bonoan y Castro, on April 28, 1908, and the uncultivated part thereof, 11 hectares 27 ares and 92 centares,or a total approximate area of 23 hectares 77 ares and 92 centares, but that the true measurement of the said land is 28 hectares 54 ares and 60 centares; bounded on the north formerly by Arcadio Almazan, and now by Celestino Almazan and a ditch; on the northeast, formerly by Andres Castro, and\u00a0 now by Epifanio; on the east, by a stony tract;on the southeast, by Domingo Caluya; on the south, formerly by Elias Villanueva and now by the latter's son, Benigno Villanueva; and on the west, formerly by Andres Castro and now by Esteban Castro and his coheirs; that Abraham Peralta was used as an intervener by the plaintiffs about April 1, 1908, Dorotea Bonoan then being a plaintiff and claiming the property in question, but by the compromise aforementioned, submitted to the Court of First Instance on July 7 of the same year, the said Peralta and Bonoan agreed to divide equally the cleared as well as the timbered portion of said land; that Peralta, about the month of August, 1903, unlawfully took possession of the said property without the Knowledge of the plaintiffs and in spite of their objections he still continues in possession of one-half of the land, while the other half is held by Dorotea Bonoan under the compromise mentioned, as she could not dispose of the land, for she is only a coparcener of the plaintiffs and has a mother, brothers, and sisters with rights in the part she holds; that the\u00a0 plaintiffs have therefore brought this action against the defendants for the recovery of possession of the land afore described and have suffered losses and damages in consequence of the acts of the defendants on the said property, through their failure to collect the produce of the land which\u00a0 amounts to 600 <i>uyones<\/i> of rice, valued at P1 an <i>uyon<\/i>, and ask that judgment be rendered sentencing Abraham Peralta y Guerrero to deliver to the plaintiffs the property now in his possession, and Dorotea Bonoan y Castro to deliver to the plaintiffs the part of the said land she unlawfully and improperly disposed of, and that the defendants be sentenced to deliver to the plaintiffs the 600 <i>uyones<\/i> of rice which the latter failed to receive as the produce of the land or the equivalent thereof in cash amounting to P600, and to pay the costs of the trial.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendants, in his written answer, sets forth that he denies generally and specifically each and all of the allegations of the complaint and, as a defense,alleges that the land described in the complaint has belonged exclusively to the defendant Dorotea Bonoan from time immemorial, and that more than ten years ago, her codefendant, Peralta, obtained a right\u00a0 in the same land, by having at his own expense brought under cultivation about 12 hectares and 50 ares thereof, which right was recognized by the defendant Dorotea Bonoan in a compromise made on April 23, 1908; that the plaintiffs had no property in San Julian de Culao, Dingras, for the land in question was twice inundated and completely converted into a sand-bank, once in 1872 and again in 1882, and up to the present time has been uncultivated and sandy, and that if the plaintiffs really did have property in the said place, it would be the stony tract and not what the defendant Abraham Peralta had brought under cultivation and had been tilling for more than ten years, which belonged to Dorotea Bonoan, her mother, brothers, and sisters; that the defendants be absolved from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>On September 30,1908, Felix Nicolas set forth in writing that, having learned of the present suit over ownership of the land in question and being directly interested in the plaintiffs' side of the case, he therefore desired to join them in pushing it and requested permission to file a complaint as intervener against the defendants, which petition was granted by order of November 12 of the same year.<br\/><br\/>On April 27, 1909, the plaintiffs, for reasons stated, requested in writing an injunction restraining the defendants from continuing to perform acts of destruction on the land in question, asked that the latter be finally sentenced to payment of the sum claimed as losses and damages occasioned, and further, that the defendants be prohibited from constructing the dam and ditch on the property of the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>This petition was opposed by counsel for the defendants, who requested that the injunction prayed for be not issued and that the costs be assessed against the plaintiffs, which the court granted, refusing the injunction requested by the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>On account of the death of Gregorjo Guerrero, counsel for Eulogio Guerrero, the legitimate son of the said deceased, requested in writing on July 18, 1910, that he be admitted as a party to this suit, for the reason that he had already applied to the court for the issuance in his behalf of letters of administration for the estate left by his said father, in order that the course of the proceedings might not be stayed, or else that he be granted an extension of the period of thirty days allowed him so that he\u00a0 might have an opportunity to represent in this suit the succession of the deceased.\u00a0 The record does not show whether any action was taken on this petition.<br\/><br\/>The case came to trial, and the evidence introduced by both parties having been examined, the court, on September 2, 1910, rendered judgment finding that the land situated in San Julian de Culao, Dingras, consisting of 28 hectares 54 ares and 60 centares, bounded on the north by Celestino Almazan and a ditch, on the northeast, by one Epifanio, on the east, by a stony tract, on the southeast, by Domingo Caluya, on the south, by Benigno Villanueva, and on the west, by Esteban Castro and his coheirs, belongs to Severino P. Cid, Estanislao Nicolas, Gregorio Guerrero, and Fernando Bonoan, and sentenced the defendants, Abraham Peralta and Dorotea Bonoan, to deliver it to them, without express finding as to the costs.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendants excepted to this judgment and presented a written motion to set it aside and grant a new trial.\u00a0 This motion was overruled by an order of September 3, and an exception thereto was entered by counsel for the\u00a0 defendants.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the plaintiffs prayed for the issuance of a writ of execution of the previous judgment, for delivery of the land in question to them, after such legal formalities and guarantees as might be deemed necessary, which petition was opposed by counsel for the defendants, who requested in writing that the same be not granted from lack of sufficient grounds in its support; but the court, by an order of the 5th of September, directed that the judgment be executed upon the filing of a bond for P3,000 with two or more bondsmen to answer for any losses and damages that might be occasioned the defendants through the execution of the said judgment, now on appeal.\u00a0 The record, however, does not show that the bond was given.<br\/><br\/>Upon the filing of the proper bill of exceptions the same was approved, certified, and forwarded, together with a transcript of the evidence, to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>From the documentary and oral evidence produced in the trial of this case, it has been fully proven that the plaintiffs, Severino P. Cid y Mata, Estanislao Nicolas y Juan and Gregorio Guerrero y Mata, together with the heirs and successors of Fernando Bonoan, are the legitimate and joint owners of a tract of land situated in the place called San Julian de Culao, of the pueblo of Dingras, Ilocos Norte, the area, location, and boundaries of which land\u00a0 are specified in the complaint.\u00a0 It was duly proved at the trial that the said owners of the land in question had been cultivating the tillable part thereof by means of laborers, for the rest is sandy and stony, and that the plaintiffs, through their employees, had continued and persisted in the cultivation of the said property, notwithstanding the damage caused thereto by two floods which rendered the land untillable for some time.\u00a0 It was also proved that, the land having been assessed in 1902 solely in the name of the plaintiff Severino P. Cid, he1 paid the tax levied thereon; but in 1907 a part of the land was assessed in the name of Fernando Bonoan, who paid the corresponding tax, while the rest of the land was assessed in the name of Gregorio Guerrero and as the tax pertaining thereto was not paid by him, the said part of the land in his name was attached and sold at public auction to Abraham Peralta; and although Gregorio Guerrero afterwards repurchased the property and was placed in possession thereof, Peralta, though he then ceased to be the owner of the part so acquired by him at auction, still persisted in seizing all the property, including the other part thereof assessed in the name of Fernando Bonoan.<br\/><br\/>In this state of affairs an action for recovery was brought by Dorotea Bonoan, the daughter of Fernando Bonoan, against the detainer of the whole property, Abraham Peralta, but before the hearing thereon the parties compromised the suit by dividing the disputed land between themselves almost equally, to the detriment, not only of the other coowners of the land, who endeavored to present a claim as interveners, but also of the coheirs of Dorotea Bonoan, children of the deceased Fernando.<br\/><br\/>In the compromise entered into in that suit, Dorotea Bonoan, without any right whatever, disposed\u00a0 of all the land, which did not belong to her absolutely, nor even entirely to her father, for he, as a coheir in the whole property,was only entitled to a part thereof, and Dorotea Bonoan,with respect to that part belonging to her deceased father,is merely a coowner with her mother, brothers, and sisters,and, consequently, in no wise could she have made a lawful conveyance of the said\u00a0 one-half of the land to Abraham Peralta.<br\/><br\/>The latter, in turn, as the mere detainer of the part of the land conveyed by his codefendant, Dorotea Bonoan, could not acquire over the portion thereof conveyed to him any legally justified right whatever, since he received it from a person who absolutely lacked the right to transfer to him the ownership of the portion of such property improperly conveyed to him.\u00a0 If Dorotea Bonoan was not vested with a full right to make such a conveyance and no ownership rights whatever over the part conveyed were conferred upon her, then neither could the transferee, Abraham Peralta,have acquired any right at all which could in any manner in the eyes of the law justify and legalize the usurpation committed by him to the prejudice of the plaintiffs.<br\/><br\/>If Peralta acquired any right in a part of the land which was sold to him at public auction by the Government by reason of the insolvency of the taxpayer in whose name the said part of the property was assessed, still as soon as the latter, Gregorio Guerrero, repurchased the part of the land sold to him\u00a0 and was reinstated as the owner of the property, the tax on which had been in arrears, Peralta, the highest bidder, ceased to be the owner and proprietor of the land which he had purchased at auction and thereafter could have had no right or reason to seize either the land repurchased by Gregorio Guerrero or, much less, the rest of the land assessed against Fernando Bonoan, which was not even put up for sale.<br\/><br\/>The defendant Peralta seized all the land in litigation and after the compromise kept one-half of the property by virtue of the agreement made with his codefendant, Dorotea Bonoan.\u00a0 He in no wise proved, as he alleges, that the latter was the absolute owner\u00a0 of all the land in question, so as to have been able upon such proof to establish his acquisition of the right which he claims to have in the part of the property which he now holds and refuses to return to the plaintiffs, its true owners.<br\/><br\/>Pursuant to article 348 of the Civil Code, the owner has a right of action against the holder and the possessor of the thing to recover the same.\u00a0 The surviving plaintiffs and the heirs of the deceased Gregorio Guerrero and Fernando Bonoan are the legitimate owners in equal shares\u00a0 ofthe land owned by them in common (art. 392, Civil Code), and not only have they proved their common ownership\u00a0 in the land sought to be recovered but also the identity of the same; therefore the action hereby brought for the recovery of possession has, without any doubt, the support of law,especially since the documentary and oral evidence furnished by those owners in reference to the aforesaid features of the case has not been impugned or rebutted by any evidence of the defendants; on the contrary, Fausta de Castro, who appears to be the widow of Fernando Bonoan, and therefore the mother of the defendant Dorotea Bonoan, testified during the trial for the plaintiffs, affirming their right and ownership in the disputed land.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from are deemed to have been refuted, the said judgment is affirmed with the costs against the appellants, but without prejudice to the rights of Dorotea Bonoan and her heirs to the portion of the land that belonged to her father, Fernando Bonoan.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Gimenea was there and said to the sergeant who was in charge of the guard at the&nbsp; time, &quot;Let them talk two minutes.&quot;&nbsp; Perez, who gave the money to his father-in-law, told him that when they turned him loose to give them the money.&nbsp; They then left the hospital and going around to the rear of the building waited there according to the arrangement for their father, whom they were to take that same night to a farm belonging to him located up in the mountains.&nbsp; They waited there until 2 o&#39;clock in the morning, when, becoming discouraged at the nonappearance of their father, they went home.&nbsp; In the meantime, the&nbsp; old man had delivered the&nbsp; money to Gimenea and at about 1 or&nbsp; 2 o&#39;clock in the morning went downstairs with Gimenea.&nbsp; <em>The latter removed the grating of a window and just as the old man stepped out he was stopped by a sentry, whereupon Gimenea told him to go back and they would try it again.<\/em>&nbsp; The next morning Perez informed the lieutenant of the Constabulary in charge of the whole matter.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe defense introduced a number of Constabulary soldiers, among whom were all three of the defendants.&nbsp; Faustino Broan, Benigno Encabo, Clemente Sarosad, and the appellant, all testified that on the morning of the 19th of April at a quarter of 3 Cabilao attempted to leave the hospital; that he was caught in the attempt and made to go back upstairs.&nbsp; Encabo, who was on guard from 9 to 11, testified that a vehicle came up to the hospital which he halted, ordering the occupants to descend; that Perez descended and requested permission to talk with Cabilao, and Bongo who was the sergeant in charge of the guard at the time gave him permission to talk for two minutes.&nbsp; Gimenea testified that about two weeks before the attempted escape he borrowed P10 from Perez, but denied sending the soldier Ara&ntilde;as for the money.&nbsp; Later he admitted that he had sent Ara&ntilde;as for the money.&nbsp; He further admitted that the old man had talked with him and the defendant Senieres regarding the possibility of getting his freedom and had requested them to make a recommendation to that effect, but denied that Cabilao had offered him any money.&nbsp; It was agreed between the witnesses who testified to the fact, that at the time Cabilao attempted to leave the&nbsp; hospital there were three soldiers on guard.&nbsp; Broan testified that he was one; that he did not leave his post when he heard the old man trying to get out of the hospital, but simply called the corporal of the guard; that while the corporal was reprimanding the old man for coming downstairs, Gimenea came up followed by the other sentry on guard; that no one called Gimenea, who had been&nbsp; sleeping near the hospital.&nbsp; Encabo testified that he was the soldier who had come up to the scene of the disturbance with Gimenea but testified that he was not on&nbsp; duty at the time as his turn came at 3 o&#39;clock, or about fifteen minutes after the time of the disturbance.&nbsp; He said that a soldier from another company was on guard at the time.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn rebuttal, the prosecution introduced&nbsp; Victorino Ranas (<em>alias<\/em> Aranas), a Constabulary soldier, who testified that he went to&nbsp; the house of Perez on April 17 by orders of Gimenea, received from Perez P10 in the presence of three men and one woman, and took this&nbsp; money, according to his instructions, to the house of one&nbsp; Sabino Dapat where Gimenea awaited him; that he delivered the money to Gimenea and that he (witness) did not&nbsp; receive&nbsp; any of it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt will be noted that the witnesses for the defense,admitted that Cabilao had talked with the appellant concerning his desire to be set free several days before the night of the attempted escape; that the appellant admits receiving P10 from Perez in the manner set forth by the prosecution, but denies that it was on the 17th&nbsp; of April.&nbsp; It is admitted that Perez came to the hospital at 10 o&#39;clock that night and talked with&nbsp; his father-in-law for &quot;two minutes.&quot;&nbsp; It is admitted that Cabilao came downstairs on the night in question, and that Gimenea was there at the time without having been called by any one.&nbsp; But it is denied that there was any connivance between the appellant and the witnesses for the, prosecution in the frustrated plan of setting Cabilao, sr., at liberty.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution is not, as&nbsp; urged by counsel for the appellant, inconsistent and contradictory.&nbsp; Only two such alleged inconsistencies are pointed out.&nbsp; One is to the effect that Cabilao, sr., testified that P150 had been agreed upon as to the amount to be paid for the assistance of the defendants, while at other times it is testified that P10 and P90 were the amounts actually paid.&nbsp; There is no inconsistency here.&nbsp; There is no contradiction as to the amount actually paid, and that is the important point.&nbsp; The other alleged inconsistency is to the effect that Perez first stated that Sarosad and Gimenea had made the demand on him for money, while later on he said that Senieres had talked to Cabilao, sr., in reference to the&nbsp; matter.&nbsp; There can be no inconsistency here.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe same cannot be said of the testimony of the witnesses for the defense.&nbsp; In addition, Victorino Ranas positively declared that it was on the 17th of April that he went to the house of Perez for the P10, that he was ordered to go there by Gimenea, and that there were three men and one woman present when the money was delivered to him.&nbsp; This agrees exactly with the testimony of the relatives of Cabilao.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe result is that it has been established beyond any question of a doubt that the appellant did agree to aid Cabilao in making this escape from the hospital, and that the Cabilao family sent P10 to him by the soldier Ranas on April 17 which he accepted, and that he also received P90 from&nbsp; Escolastico Cabilao on the night of April 18 when the latter attempted to escape; and that these amounts were paid to him for his assistance in effecting the escape of Cabilao from the hospital.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe lower court sentenced the&nbsp; appellant under article 382 of the Penal Code, which reads as follows :<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;Art. 382.&nbsp; Any public officer who shall agree to commit any injustice not constituting a crime in connection with the exercise of the powers of his office, in consideration of any offer or promise or of any gift or present received by such officer, personally or through the mediation of another,<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nshall, if the injustice be committed, suffer the penalty of <em>presidio correccional<\/em> in its medium and minimum degrees and pay a fine of not less than the value of the gift and not more than three times such value; if the injustice shall not have been committed, a penalty ranging from <em>arresto mayor<\/em> in its maximum degree to <em>presidio correccional<\/em> in its minimum degree and a fine of not less than the value of the gift and not more than double such value shall be imposed.&quot;<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 1 of Act No. 1711 provides in part as follows:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;The Director of Health and his authorized agents are hereby empowered to cause to be apprehended, and detained, isolated, segregated, or&nbsp; confined, all leprous persons in the Philippine Islands, and upon application of the Director of Health it shall&nbsp; be the duty of every Insular, provincial, or municipal official having police powers to cause to be arrested and delivered to the Director of Health, or his agent, any person alleged or believed to be a leper, and it shall be the duty of such officers to assist in the conveyance of any person so arrested to such place as the Director of Health or his agents may require, in order that such person may be subject to medical inspection, and such other procedure as may be necessary to establish a diagnosis, and thereafter to assist in removing such person to a place for detention, treatment, isolation, or segregation, if so required by the Director of Health or his agents:&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&quot;<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 6 of the same Act reads:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;Any person violating any of the last five preceding sections shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine not to exceed two hundred pesos, or imprisonment for not to exceed six months, or both, in the discretion of the court.&quot;<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Escolastico Cabilao had been arrested by direction of the Bureau of Health and was being conveyed to the Culion leper colony.&nbsp; While awaiting transportation he was being detained in the hospital at Cebu, and the appellant, among others, was designated to see that he was properly kept in quarantine.&nbsp; This was in brief the task assigned to the appellant; and it was his duty, within the meaning of section 1 of Act No. 1711.&nbsp; By cooperating in an attempt to accomplish what it was actually his duty to prevent, there was an open and notorious violation of the said section 1 of Act No. 1711, penalized by section 6 of the same Act, as above quoted.&nbsp; The appellant&#39;s acts, therefore, properly come under the provisions of article 381 of the Penal Code, which reads as follows:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&quot;ART. 381. Any public officer who shall agree to commit any criminal act in connection with the exercise of the powers of his office, in consideration of any offer or any promise or any gift or&nbsp; present received by such officer, personally or through the mediation of another, shall suffer the penalties of <em>presidio correccional<\/em> in its minimum and medium degrees and a fine of not less than the value of the gift and not more than three times such amount, without prejudice to the imposition of the penalty corresponding to the crime agreed upon, if the same shall&nbsp; have been committed.&quot;<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Viada, volume 2, page 642, in discussing article 381, says that to constitute the crime of bribery as provided in this article, four things are necessary:&nbsp; (1) That the defendant be a public officer according to the meaning of this term in article 401; (2) that he has received either personally or through another gifts or presents or accepted offers or promises; (3) that such reception of gifts or presents or acceptance of offers or promises has been for the purpose of executing a crime; and (4) that the act constituting the crime relates to the exercise of the office which the public officer discharges.&nbsp; All these concur in the present case.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe judgment of the lower court as to the appellant Francisco Gimenea is therefore modified, and he is sentenced to one year eight months and twenty-one days of <em>presidio correccional<\/em>, to a fine of P300, to the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, to the accessory penalties provided by law, and to the payment of one-third the costs of the cause.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<em>Arellano, C J., Torres<\/em> and <em>Moreland, JJ<\/em>., concur.<\/p>",

Zook, plaintiff, began an action in the Court of First Instance of Rizal against Robert Coker, defendant, for the recovery of a sum of money alleged to have been loaned by the plaintiff to the defendant.\u00a0 The trial was set for the 6th day of February, 1912.\u00a0 The plaintiff did not appear and the court dismissed the action, placing such dismissal expressly under paragraph 2, section 127 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0 A few days later the plaintiff paid the costs adjudged against him in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Rizal, and thereafter brought suit against the defendant in the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila for the recovery of the same sum of money which was the subject matter of the action in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Rizal.\u00a0 The answer was a general denial and contained the special defense that the judgment of dismissal by the Court of First Instance of Rizal was <i>res judicata<\/i> in the present action.\u00a0 The plea of estoppel and bar is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That on the 6th day of February, 1912, in Pasig, Rizal Province, Philippine Islands, in an action then pending and numbered 878 in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Fifth District, between the same plaintiff and the same defendant, entitled Ellsworth E. Zook,\u00a0 plaintiff, <i>vs<\/i>. Robert Coker, defendant, and for the same cause of action as is now set forth in this complaint, judgment\u00a0 was duly given by the court in favor of the present defendant, as follows:\u00a0 This cause is set for trial to-day in accordance with a previous application of the plaintiff, dated January 23 last, alleging that he would be ready to try the case during the first part of the present month.\u00a0 The case being called, the court finds in the record a motion of the plaintiff, dated the 5th and filed on the 6th, which alleges that by reason of the fact that the plaintiff and his partner are occupied in the trial of cases in the courts of the city of Manila, which cases are referred to and set forth in said motion, he asks a further adjournment of the trial of the case.\u00a0 The attorney for the defendant objects to the adjournment and asks for a dismissal of the case by reason of the great prejudice which would result to the defendant otherwise.\u00a0 The court, considering both motions, declines to adjourn the cause, for the reason that it has already been adjourned once and that the reasons set forth by the plaintiff are not sufficient to justify another adjournment.\u00a0 The plaintiff might have asked for the\u00a0 adjournment of the trials in Manila and tried the present cause,\u00a0 as to the time of which\u00a0 he has been informed since the 24th of January last; and for the further reason that the defendant is an officer in the United States Army who must sail from the Islands on the 14th of January, and inasmuch as the adjournment would cause him great prejudice, the court, making use of the authority conferred by paragraph 2 of section 127 of Act No. 190, dismisses the present action with costs against the plaintiff.'\"<\/blockquote>The plaintiff demurred to this special defense upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute the defense of estoppel by <i>res judicata<\/i> or otherwise.\u00a0 The trial court overruled the demurrer.\u00a0 This appeal is taken from that order.<br\/><br\/>A motion has been made to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it is not from a final judgment under section 123 of the\u00a0 Code of Civil Procedure and the decisions of this court thereunder.\u00a0 The motion is well founded.\u00a0 (Segovia <i>vs<\/i>. Prov. Board of Albay et al., 13 Phil. Rep., 331; Averia <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Reboldera, 10 Phil. Rep., 316; Serrano et al. <i>vs<\/i>. Serrano, 9 Phil. Rep., 142.)\u00a0 While this is true, nevertheless, for the purpose of preventing unnecessary litigation, trouble, and expense, we give our opinion upon the question raised by the appeal, it haying been presented to and fully argued in this court before the motion to dismiss was made.\u00a0 (Lichauco <i>vs<\/i>. Limjuco, 19 Phil. Rep., 12.)<br\/><br\/>The learned trial court overruled the demurrer upon the authority of the case of Yangco <i>vs<\/i>. De Asis, 22 Phil. Rep., 201.\u00a0 In this the court erred.\u00a0 In the case of Yangco <i>vs<\/i>. De Asis, the action was originally brought against Luis R. Yangco to\u00a0 recover the value of certain medical services.\u00a0 After evidence relative to the rendition and value of the alleged services had been introduced and while the plaintiff was on the witness stand in his own behalf, \"he stated that he was losing time in the trial of the case and that he wished to dismiss his complaint and make the defendant a present of his services,\"\u00a0 The court thereupon made the following order:<br\/><blockquote>\"This case this day came on for trial upon the complaint, answer, cross complaint, and proof, and while the plaintiff was on the witness stand, pending his examination, he stated that he was losing too much time in the trial of the case and that he wished to dismiss his complaint and make the defendant a present of his services:\u00a0 It is, therefore, ordered and adjudged by the court that this case be and the same is hereby dismissed, and that the defendant, Luis R. Yangco, recover of the plaintiff, Antonio de Asis, the costs of this case, for which execution may issue.\"<\/blockquote>After the death of Luis R. Yangco, Antonio de Asis sought to present against his estate the same claim which had been the\u00a0 subject matter of the action taken against Yangco in his lifetime and which had been dismissed as heretofore stated.\u00a0 This court held that the claim could not be presented, as the judgment in the former action was <i>res judicata<\/i> and was a bar thereto.<br\/><br\/>Between the case at bar and the case cited by the trial court to sustain his opinion there exists, then, these differences:\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 In\u00a0 the Yangco case the plaintiff appeared personally at the trial.\u00a0 In\u00a0 the case at bar he did not.\u00a0 (2) In the Yangco case evidence was introduced and the plaintiff himself was on the stand as a witness when the action was dismissed.\u00a0 In the case at bar no evidence was introduced, the plaintiff was not even present in court nor was he represented by attorney who was present.\u00a0 (3) In the Yangco case the plaintiff himself requested a final and irrevocable dismissal of the action.\u00a0 In the case at bar nothing of that sort happened.\u00a0 (4) In the Yangco case the plaintiff by his own act, upon grounds sufficient unto himself, sought to destroy and wipe out completely the subject matter of his action, saying that by reason of the time he was spending in the collection of the claim he desired to terminate the matter finally and to that end to make a present of said claim to the defendant.\u00a0 In the case at bar nothing of the sort occurred.\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 In the Yangco case the court dismissed the action finally upon the evidence produced in the case and\u00a0 upon the definite, specific, and voluntary abandonment in open court by the plaintiff of any cause of action which he might have against the defendant, which abandonment was accepted by the court and parties and acted upon by the court by the entry of a final judgment thereon.\u00a0 In the case at bar nothing of the kind occurred.\u00a0 And finally, (6) in the case at bar the court, as is seen above, expressly placed his dismissal of the case under paragraph 2 of section 127 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that an action may be dismissed \"by the court, when the plaintiff fails to\u00a0 appear at the time of the trial, and the defendant appears and asks for the dismissal;\" and which said, section also provides that in such case \" a dismissal of the action shall not be a bar to another action for the same cause.\"\u00a0 In the Yangco case no such dismissal was made.<br\/><br\/>We, therefore, see that the two cases are different both superficially and fundamentally.<br\/><br\/>The appeal is dismissed and the cause remanded for trial.\u00a0 No costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Joya Admana, acting\u00a0 as judge\u00a0 of First Instance, sentenced the defendants in both cases to deliver to the plaintiff the respective portions of land detained and claimed by them respectively in two complaints, with all the costs in favor of the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>On November 20, 1911, Jose Agregado, the administrator of the intestate estate of the deceased Prospero Montalvo and Sixta Madlanbayan, brought suit in the Court of First Instance of Batangas against the spouses Vicente Mu\u00f1oz and Juana Macalalad, alleging that the said deceased spouses Prospero Montalvo and Sixta Madlanbayan possessed during their lifetime for thirty-five years, and after their death their heirs for more than twenty years had been holding as owners <i>pro indiviso<\/i> and in common, a tract of land about 250 <i>cavanes<\/i> of seed rice in area, situated in the barrio of Talumpoc of the pueblo of Batangas and bounded on the east by the rivers named Balatgan and Putingbato, on the west by the Baquis River, on the north by the property of the heirs of Toribio, Placido and Teodoro Macalalad, and on the south by that of Potenciano Lontok, Monico Alvarez and the heirs of Demetrio Borillo; which land had been acquired partly by inheritance and partly by purchase; that, in the year 1906, the defendants unlawfully appropriated to themselves a portion of the said land, to wit, an area of about 10 <i>cavanes<\/i> of seed rice, situated on its eastern side and bounded on the north by the land of Simeon Macalalad, on the\u00a0 west by that of the heirs of the deceased Montalvo\u00a0 and Madlanbayan, now detained by Andres Magadia, on the south by the land of Igmidio Lontok, and on the west by that of the heirs of the said deceased; that, notwithstanding the friendly steps he had taken to the end that the defendants might return the usurped land, he had not succeeded in his purpose, since the defendants, without good reason had refused to restore the property to him, whereby he had suffered losses and damages to the amount of P875.\u00a0 It was therefore prayed that judgment be rendered herein, finding that\u00a0 the land in\u00a0 litigation had been the exclusive property of the deceased spouses Montalvo and Madlanbayan, and that the defendants be ordered to return the same to the plaintiff and pay P875 as losses and damages, and the costs of the suit.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendants Mu\u00f1oz and Macalalad denied in his answer each and all of the paragraphs of the complaint and in special defense alleged that the land claimed by the plaintiff was bounded on the northeast by that of Igmidio Lontok and the Inuman River, on the northwest by property of Andres Magadia and the deceased Prospero Montalvo, on the southeast by Mount Talim, and on the southwest by the Putingbato River and the lands of Luciano Suarez; that the said land had in fact an area of 10 <i>cavanes<\/i> of seed rice, had belonged to Placido Macalalad and.at his death passed to his heirs, Narciso, Cipriano, Victoria, Dorotea, Tomas, Juan, Justo, Toribio, Domingo, Valeriana, Modesta, Melchora, and Juana, the latter now one of the defendants, all of the surname of Macalalad, to which heirs it belonged <i>pro indiviso<\/i>, although the defendants had been holding and cultivating it for more than thirty years as the coowners of the persons above named; and that during the said period of thirty years the defendants had never been disturbed in their quiet and public possession of the land in question, which never had\u00a0 belonged to the deceased Montalvo and Madlanbayan. Said counsel therefore prayed that judgment be rendered in his clients' favor and against the plaintiff, by dismissal of the complaint and the assessment of the costs upon the latter.<br\/><br\/>By a written complaint of November 20, 1911, the administrator of the intestate estate of the said Prospero Montalvo and Sixta Madlanbayan brought suit in the Court of First Instance of Batangas against Andres Magadia and alleged that the said spouses, then deceased, had held as owners during their lifetime for a period of more than thirty-five years and after their death their heirs had been holding for more than twenty years <i>pro indiviso<\/i> and in common a tract of land, the situation, boundaries and area of which were set forth in the complaint; that the defendant Magadia unlawfully seized a portion of the said land, comprising an area of about 7 <i>cavanes<\/i> of seed rice, situated on the eastern side of the said larger tract and bounded on the north by the land of Simeon Macalalad, on the east by the Balatgan River and the land of Igmidio Lontok, on the south by the land of this latter, and on the west by that of the heirs of Montalvo and Madlanbayan, then detained by Juana Macalalad; that, notwithstanding the friendly steps taken by the plaintiff, he had not succeeded in obtaining the recovery of the parcel of land detained, since the defendant, without just reason, refused to return the same to him, on which account the plaintiff had suffered losses and damages in the sum of P612; and he therefore prayed that judgment be rendered by holding that the disputed land was of the exclusive ownership of the said spouses Montalvo and Madlanbayan and by ordering the defendant Magadia to restore the said portion of land to the plaintiff and to pay him P612 as losses and damages, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, Andres Magadia, denied in his answer each and all of the paragraphs of the complaint and as a special defense alleged that the land in question was bounded on the northeast by the Balatgan River and the lands of Igmidio Lontok, on the northeast by a ravine and the lands of the heirs of Placido Macalalad and of Simeon Macalalad, on the southeast by the land of the heirs of Placido Macalalad, and on the southeast by that which belonged to the deceased Prospero Montalvo; that the land in question had in fact an approximate area of 7 <i>cavanes<\/i> of seed, had belonged to Teodoro Macalalad and, upon his death, was inherited by his children and from them passed into the possession of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren; that its present owners were Crisanta and Eugenio Macalalad, grandchildren of Teodoro Macalalad, and Eulogio Macalalad, Patricio Candor and Andres Magadia, the latter the defendant, great grandchildren of the said Teodoro Macalalad; that the said land still remained <i>pro indiviso<\/i> among its coowners, although Andres Magadia had been\u00a0 holding and cultivating it for more than fifteen years, as it had likewise been held and cultivated for more than twenty years by Vicente Magadia, the father of the defendant Andres; and that\u00a0 during the lapse of more than thirty-five years neither Vicente nor his son Andres, the defendant, had ever been disturbed in their quiet and public possession of the said land, which did not belong and had never belonged to the deceased Montalvo and Madlanbayan.\u00a0 He therefore\u00a0 asked that judgment be rendered against the plaintiff, by absolving the defendant from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>After the hearing of both cases, consolidated by agreement of the parties, and the introduction of evidence by both sides, the court rendered in both cases the judgment aforementioned, to which the defendants excepted and moved for a rehearing.\u00a0 These motions were denied and an exception to the ruling was taken by the defendants and appellants.<br\/><br\/>The demand made in these two consolidated cases is for the recovery of possession of two parcels of land which form a part of a large tract about 250 cavanes of seed rice in area, belonging to the heirs of the deceased Prospero Montalvo and Sixta Madlanbayan, one of which parcels, with an area of about 10 <i>cavanes<\/i> of seed, was usurped by Vicente Munoz and Juana Macalalad, and the other of them, with an area of some 7 <i>cavanes<\/i> of seed, by Andres Magadia, who both claim to be the owners of these two parcels of land respectively held by them, for the reason that they inherited them from their ancestors.<br\/><br\/>The trial court, after due consideration of the allegations made and proved by both parties and after carefully weighing the evidence introduced by both sides, held that there was a preponderance of evidence in support of the claim made by the plaintiff and that the two parcels of land demanded in the two complaints filed, against Vicente Mu\u00f1oz and Juana Macalalad in case No. 8648 and against Andres Magadia in No. 8649, certainly and undoubtedly belonged to the heirs and successors of their original owners, Prospero Montalvo and Sixta Madlanbayan.<br\/><br\/>The record in fact shows that the said large tract of land is still\u00a0 undivided; that, upon the death of its original owners, Antonino Montalvo succeeded in the possession, management and cultivation of this property; that the latter died a bachelor and was succeeded by a nephew of his, Domingo Montalvo, in the name and representation of such nephew's coheirs, since the whole of the said land still remained <i>pro indiviso<\/i>; that the possession of this land, counting from the time it was held by its original owners, covered a period of more than sixty years; and that the defendants usurped the respective portions thereof which they now occupy, only six years before the date of the complaint. Such was the testimony of the witnesses Aniceto Magnaye and Marcelino Almares, the first of whom was a son of an employee of the Montalvo family and the second was the owner of a piece of land adjacent to the parcels of land in dispute.<br\/><br\/>Domingo Montalvo stated in his sworn testimony that after his grandparents, Prospero Montalvo and Sixta Madlanbayan, had been in possession of the land as owners for more than forty-five years, they were succeeded by his uncle, Antonino Montalvo, who cultivated the land during a period of more than twenty years and, upon his death, was succeeded by the witness in the possession and management of the said land in the name\u00a0 of his coheirs; that only in the year 1906 did the defendant unlawfully enter upon the parcels of land which they still detained; that when the witness and several companions of his went to the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sitio<\/span> of Talumpoc, the defendants, Vicente Munoz and Juana Macalalad, visited the house of Elias Mendoza, where the witness and his companions were stopping, and begged him to allow them to continue working the land which they were occupying and promised to pay him rent therefor the next year, which request, made in the presence of the administrator of the intestate estate and five other witnesses, his companions, was granted by the witness, in view of the fact that Juana Macalalad was a relative of his; that Andres Magadia also met witness in the town, on account of the former's having been questioned as to why he was working the piece of land which he had usurped, and that\u00a0 Magadia replied to him that he had bought this land from Agustin Macalalad for P25; that witness then told Magadia that he, the latter, had purchased the land from one who was not its owner, whereupon Magadia agreed to continue working the land under the condition that he should deliver to witness, as its owner, one-third of its products. Witness added that many years ago there was a lawsuit\u00a0 between Lino Macalalad and Antonino Montalvo over the same large tract of land aforementioned, whereupon the plaintiff presented the record in the civil case alluded to, decided in favor of Antonino Montalvo, judgment in which was affirmed by the <i>Real Audiencia<\/i> of Manila and afterwards by the supreme court of Spain.\u00a0 The two witnesses, Julian Suarez and Apolinario Manalo, who were present at the time Mu\u00f1oz and his wife made their request, corroborated the testimony of Domingo Montalvo and testified, as well also as another witness, that the lands in question belonged to the Montalvos.<br\/><br\/>The defendants denied the facts stated by Domingo Montalvo and alleged possession of their respective parcels of land for a long period of time ranging from fifteen to thirty-five years, that they had inherited them from their ancestors and that they were allotted to them in the partition that was made among their coowners.\u00a0 Without exhibiting any document whatever to prove their right, they presented witnesses who corroborated their allegations, but the testimony of two of these, Luciano Suarez and Fausto Baes, appears to be contradicted by the declaration of ownership made by Suarez himself in the document Exhibit 7, wherein it is set forth that west of the land concerned in the same are the lands of Toribio Montalvo, not those of Andres Magadia, and the Balatgan River, and the witness Simeon Macalalad, who in his testimony contradicts that of the aforementioned Suarez and Baes, also contradicts his own declaration wherein he states that the land declared to be his own is bounded on the west by that of Antonio Montalvo, not by that of Andres Magadia.\u00a0 The witness Fabian Lontok testified that Juana Macalalad, jointly with\u00a0 her husband, had held\u00a0 the land\u00a0 in question ever since witness could remember and that it had previously been held by Andres Magadia about fifteen years after the death of the latter's father.<br\/><br\/>Beyond the testimony aforementioned, none of the litigants has proved his allegations concerning the parcels of land in question, although their predecessors in interest had, for more than twenty-five years, carried on suits relative to nearly the whole of the land of which the portions in dispute in this case form a part.<br\/><br\/>From the two records of proceedings, marked as Exhibits 2 and 3, which the plaintiff presented at the trial, it is disclosed that Lino Macalalad maintained a long litigation against Antonino Montalvo concerning the ownership of the large tract of land before referred to, of which the two parcels in dispute form a part, and that judgment was therein rendered by the Court of First Instance of Batangas, absolving Antonio or Antonino Montalvo from the complaint and imposing perpetual silence upon the plaintiff, Lino Macalalad, and his coplaintiffs, who were sentenced to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>Upon the said records being forwarded to the <i>Real Andiencia<\/i> of Manila, on October 29, 1888, through appeal from the civil branch of the lower court, the following decision was rendered:<br\/><blockquote>\"Whereas we have reviewed the present records of the ordinary civil proceedings prosecuted in the Court of Batangas by Don Lino Macalalad and coplaintiffs against Don Antonio Montalvo, <i>in re<\/i> the partition and adjudication of certain lands of common ownership, which records were forwarded to this court through the appeal raised by the plaintiffs from the judgment of December 20, 1883, whereby Don Antonio Montalvo is absolved from the complaint and perpetual silence is enjoined upon Don Lino Macalalad and his coplaintiffs, who are sentenced to pay all the costs of the suit; and<br\/><br\/>\"Whereas we accept the statement of facts, the grounds of law and the dispositive part of the judgment appealed from; and<br\/><br\/>\"Whereas the estimation of the evidence, in accordance with the merits of the case, pertains to the trial court, as held in the decision of the supreme court of February 5, 1855, and, under this concept, the evidence should not be offered in vague and general terms, but must be presented with the specificness and clearness required by Law 6, Title 10, Book 11, of the <i>Novisima Recopilacion<\/i>, as established\u00a0 in others of its decisions; and<br\/><br\/>\"Whereas it cannot be invoked as a principle of law that trial judges should, in their qualification and estimation of the evidence, rely upon the number of the witnesses presented, but upon the value of their testimony; and, especially, when the estimation of the oral evidence pertains exclusively to the trial court, and it deems the plaintiff's evidence insufficient, it should, acting within the powers peculiar to it, acquit the defendant and absolve him from the complaint,<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore we are of the opinion that we should, as we do hereby, affirm the judgment appealed from; wherefore, declaring the complaint not proved, we should, and do hereby, absolve Don Antonio Montalvo therefrom, with the costs of both instances against the plaintiffs, upon whom we enjoin perpetual silence, and the trial judge shall order the proper person to restore the paper unduly used in the proceedings.\u00a0 Let the record be remanded to the court whence it came, accompanied by a certificate of this decision.\u00a0 So finally adjudging upon review, Justice Don Daniel Calleja speaking for the court in place of the justice of the same rank, Don Estanislao Chavez, because of the latter's absence, we pronounce, order and sign this decision.\" <\/blockquote>The plaintiff, Lino Macalalad, having filed an appeal to the supreme court of Spain from the above quoted decision of the  of Manila, Chamber III of that high tribunal, on December 17, 1899, declared that the right to the said appeal had lapsed and been lost, in accordance with the provisions of article 296 of the <i>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil<\/i> in force in these Islands, assessed the costs against the appellant, and ordered that proper certification be made to the <i>Audiencia<\/i> of Manila,<br\/><br\/>In view of the language of the aforementioned judgment of the <i>Audiencia<\/i> of Manila, affirming that rendered by the Court of First Instance of Batangas\u2014a judgment of affirmation which became final and executory\u2014and of the fact that the two parcels of land now claimed from the defendants\u00a0 are comprised within the large tract of land which was the subject matter of that former suit maintained by Lino Macalalad against Antonino Montalvo, and of the further fact that if the defendants are the successors in interest of Lino Macalalad and his fellow litigants, and if Antonino Montalvo, in turn, is the successor in interest of the original owners, Prospero Montalvo and his wife, of the land then in dispute, it is undeniable that all questions that may arise, relative to the whole or a part of the aforesaid land, between the successors in interest of the litigants in that former suit now terminated by final judgment, are barred by <i>res adjudicata<\/i> and must be perpetually respected.<br\/><br\/>Article 1252 of the Civil Code contains the following provisions applicable to the case at bar:<br\/><blockquote>\"In order that the presumption of the <i>res adjudicata<\/i> may be valid in another suit, it is necessary that, between the case decided by the sentence and that in which the same is invoked, there be the most perfect identity between the things, causes, and persons of the litigants, and their capacity as such.<br\/><br\/>\"In questions relating to the civil status of persons, and in those regarding the validity or nullity of testamentary provisions, the presumption of the <i>res adjudicata<\/i> shall be valid against third persons, even if they should not have litigated.<br\/><br\/>\"It is understood that there is identity of persons whenever the litigants of the second suit are legal representatives of those who litigated in the preceding suit, or when they are jointly bound with them or by the relations established by the indivisibility of prestations among those having a right to demand them, or the obligation to satisfy the same.\" <\/blockquote>These two consolidated cases concern two parcels of land claimed by the administrator of the property belonging to the intestate estate of the deceased spouses, Prospero Montalvo and Sixta Madlanbayan, from the defendants, Vicente Munoz and Juana Macalalad, on the one hand, and Andrea Magadia, on the other, all successors in interest of the plaintiffs, Lino. Macalalad and other coowners, in that former suit already finally decided in favor of Antonino Montalvo, as the successor in interest of his two deceased parents, Montalvo and Madlanbayan, and as one of the heirs of these latter.\u00a0 The two aforementioned parcels of land form a part of the large tract of land that was the subject matter of that old suit.\u00a0 The defendants set out in their defense that they are in\u00a0 possession of the said parcels in the capacity of owners by virtue of the hereditary right that binds them to their predecessors in interest, the said plaintiffs in the previous suit, and the administrator's claim is founded on the right of ownership held by the deceased original owners of the property now in the possession <i>pro indiviso<\/i> of their successors in interest, one of them being Antonino Montalvo, now deceased, who, in his own name and in that of his coheirs, was absolved from the complaint filed by those of the surname of Macalalad, and was recognized as the owner, jointly with\u00a0 others, of the land in litigation.\u00a0 For all these reasons, it is incontrovertible that, in accordance with the provisions of the aforequoted article of the Civil Code, the judgment rendered in that former suit, which became executory and final, produces the effect and is of the nature of <i>res adjudicata<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>It would be neither proper nor lawful to hold in the present case that the two parcels of land in litigation belong to the defendants, the successors in interest of Lino Macalalad and others, after it was decided by a final judgment that the whole tract of land belonged to Antonino Montalvo, the successor in interest of its original owners, the said two parcels of land being comprised entirely within that large tract.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, deemed to be a refutation of the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from, the said judgment should\u00a0 be, and is hereby, affirmed, with the costs against the appellants in equal parts.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal by the Collector of Customs from a judgment of the Court of First Instance in favor of Leon J. Lambert &amp; Co., reversing the decision of the Collector of Customs of the port of Manila which overruled the company's protest against the classification of, and the assessment of duties upon, certain fountain pens.\u00a0 They were classified by the appraisers as \"gold, manufactured into articles other than jewelry or plate,\" under paragraph 27 (<i>d<\/i>) of the Tariff Revision Law of 1905.\u00a0 The plaintiff claimed that they should be assessed as \"hard rubber articles not especially provided for,\" under paragraph 352 (<i>b<\/i>).\u00a0 The contention of the plaintiff is \"that rubber is the component material of chief value in these fountain pens.\"<br\/><br\/>In his decision affirming the classification of the appraisers the Collector of Customs said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The fountain pens in question are manufactured of hard rubber and gold and the appraiser found gold to be the component material of chief value.\u00a0 The importer claims that hard rubber is the material of chief value, and in support of his contention invites attention to the itemized values of the gold and rubber parts of the various styles of fountain pens as set forth on the commercial invoice filed with his protest and also in the consular invoice on file herein, which purports to show the hard rubber parts as being the material of chief value.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 That said commercial invoice as well as the consular invoice is not that of the manufacturer or seller is shown by the fact that when samples of the complete pens were requested in connection with his protest, the samples were accompanied by what the importer admits to be a copy of the genuine commercial invoice from the manufacturer, the Paul E. Wirt Fountain Pen Company, of Bloomsburg, Pa., which shows all of the pens to be invoiced as entireties, the value of none of the components being given separately.\u00a0 The appraiser, with a view to determining the value of these and similar fountain pens, has thoroughly investigated the question, and after making careful calculations and comparisons of the prices of the parts of the various grades of pens turned out by said manufacturer, and also by referring to invoices\u00a0 and samples of products of other manufacturers of fountain pens, finds that fountain pens with gold or platinum points and rubber barrels, or similar pens with gold or gold and silver plated scroll work ornamentation on the barrel, are manufactured in chief value of gold.\"<\/blockquote>It will be noticed that the question here is not so much one of classification as it is of value, it being admitted by all the parties to the controversy that the duty should be assessed upon the component material of chief value, and that in order to ascertain which is that component, the value of each component must be separately determined.\u00a0 Therefore, in deciding this case, under the facts and circumstances presented, we are governed not so much by the rules and principles governing classification as by those relating to the determination of value.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Lim Quim <i>vs<\/i>. Collector of Customs (23 Phil. Rep., 509), the court said, at page 511:<br\/><blockquote>\"The rule is well established that the value of merchandise fixed by the appraiser and affirmed by the Collector of Customs is conclusive in the absence of an affirmative showing that the appraiser, in assessing the value, proceeded upon a wrong principle and contrary to law.\u00a0 (Robertson <i>vs<\/i>. Frank Brothers Company, 132 U. S., 17; Auffmordt <i>vs<\/i>. Hedden, 137 U. S., 310; Passavant <i>vs<\/i>. United States, 148 U. S., 214; Muser <i>vs<\/i>. Magone, 155 U. S., 240.)\"<\/blockquote>In that case the court also\u00a0 said:\u00a0 \"The burden is upon the importer to overcome the presumption of a legal collection of duties by proof that their exaction was unlawful (Erhardt <i>vs<\/i>. Schroeder, 155 U. S., 124); and the importer must establish the illegality of the action of the appraisers in order to recover duties paid under protest.\u00a0 (United States <i>vs<\/i>. Ranlet and Stone, 172 U. S., 133, 146.)\"<br\/><br\/>In its decision the lower court said:\u00a0 \"The pens in question were originally invoiced assembled, and in determining the duty the appraiser at the customhouse found that the component part of chief value was the gold pen, and fixed the duty accordingly.<br\/><blockquote>\"In\u00a0 addition to the\u00a0 evidence appearing in the original record there are two other invoices of the fountain pens; one of those is made out at catalogue prices with 60 per cent discount and states nothing as to the relative values of the gold pens and the rubber cases.<br\/><br\/>\"The oral testimony presented in the case is to the effect that a large part of the value of the pens is in the labor put into the rubber cases, and that such labor is a part of the value of the component material of chief value.\u00a0 The invoice is sworn to by the agent of the seller and in the absence of evidence to the contrary must be taken\u00a0 to be correct.\"<\/blockquote>The learned court, in that part of its decision just quoted, does not lay down the rule quite as it should be.\u00a0 The invoice, although sworn to by the agent of the seller, is not conclusive as to the\u00a0 facts.\u00a0 If the customs authorities were bound by the invoice value, they would be seriously handicapped in the discharge of their duties.\u00a0 The law provides that \"the duty shall be assessed upon the actual market value or wholesale price of such merchandise, as bought and sold in usual wholesale quantities, at the time of exportation to the Philippine Islands, in the principal markets of the country from whence imported,\" and the Customs Administrative Act provides that \"appraisers shall inspect, examine, and appraise by all reasonable ways and means all imported merchandise or dutiable merchandise for exportation which may be designated by the Collector of Customs, and report to the latter in writing\" whether the prices named in the entry are correct according to the market value or wholesale price of similar goods on the day of shipment in the principal markets of the country whence exported.\"<br\/><br\/>In carrying out the provisions of the law the appraisers are not limited to the values stated in the invoice.\u00a0 They may use their own knowledge of values, they may make all reasonable investigations for the purpose of determining the value; and if it is their opinion that the values stated in the invoice are not the true values, they may reject them and assess the values according to their own judgment so made up.\u00a0 It is too well settled to admit of further discussion that the valuation of imported merchandise so\u00a0 arrived at is conclusive in the absence of fraud or illegality.\u00a0 (Muser <i>vs<\/i>. Magone, above.)<br\/><br\/>In\u00a0 determining the value of component materials going to make up a given article, the component materials should be taken at the time they are put together to form the completed article and not in the\u00a0 raw and unmanufactured condition in which the manufacturer\u00a0 received them.\u00a0 (Seeberger <i>vs<\/i>. Hardy, 150 U. S., 420.)<br\/><br\/>The appraisers classified the\u00a0 articles properly and correctly assessed their value.<br\/><br\/>The judgment is reversed and the decision of the Insular Collector of Customs affirming the appraisal of his subordinates is affirmed.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Co.\"<\/blockquote>The Court of First Instance of Iloilo sentenced the defendant to two years of <i>presidio correccional<\/i>, to pay Juana Montilla P2,498 Philippine currency, and in case of insolvency to subsidiary imprisonment at P2.50 per day, not to exceed one-third of the principal penalty, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>The defendant appealed, alleging as errors:\u00a0 (1) Holding that the document executed by him was a certificate of deposit; (2) holding the existence of a deposit, without precedent transfer or delivery of the P2,498; and (3) classifying the facts in the case as the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>.<br\/><blockquote>\"A deposit is constituted from the time a person receives a thing belonging to another with the obligation of keeping and returning it.\"\u00a0 (Art. 1758, Civil Code.)<\/blockquote>That the defendant received P2,498 is a fact proven.\u00a0 The defendant drew up a document declaring that they remained in his possession, which he could not have said had he not received them.\u00a0 They remained in his possession, surely in no other sense than to take care of them, for <i>they remained<\/i> has no other purpose.\u00a0\u00a0 They remained in the defendant's possession at the disposal of Veraguth; but on August 28 of the same year Veraguth demanded of him through a notarial instrument restitution of them, and to date he has not restored them.<br\/><br\/>The appellant says:\u00a0 \"Juana Montilla's agent voluntarily accepted the sum of; P2,498 in an instrument payable on demand, and as no attempt was made to cash it until August 23, 1911, he could indorse and negotiate it like any other commercial instrument.\u00a0 There is no doubt that if Veraguth accepted the receipt for P2,498 it was because at that time he agreed with the defendant to consider the operation of sale on commission closed, leaving the collection of said sum until later, which sum remained as a loan payable upon presentation of the receipt.\"\u00a0 (Brief, 3 and 4.)<br\/><br\/>Then, after averring the true facts:\u00a0 (1) That a sales commission was\u00a0 precedent; (2) that this\u00a0 commission was settled with a balance of P2,498\u00a0 in favor of the principal, Juana Montilla; and (3) that this balance remained in the possession of the defendant, who drew up an instrument payable on demand, he has drawn two conclusions, both erroneous:\u00a0 One, that the instrument drawn up in the form of a <i>deposit<\/i> certificate could be indorsed or negotiated like any other commercial instrument; and the other, that the sum of P2,498 remained in defendant's possession as a loan.<br\/><br\/>It is erroneous to assert that the certificate of <i>deposit<\/i> in question is negotiable like any other commercial instrument:\u00a0 First, because every commercial instrument is not negotiable; and, second, because only instruments payable to order are negotiable.\u00a0 Hence, this instrument not being to order but to bearer, it is not negotiable.<br\/><br\/>It is also erroneous to assert that the sum of money set forth in said certificate is, according to it, in the defendant's possession as a loan.\u00a0 In a loan the lender transmits to the borrower the use of the thing lent, while in a deposit the use of the thing is not transmitted, but merely possession for its custody or safe-keeping.<br\/><br\/>In order that the depositary may use or dispose of the things deposited, the depositor's consent is required, and then:<br\/><blockquote>\"The rights and obligations of the depositary and of the depositor shall cease, and the rules and provisions applicable to commercial loans, commission, or contract which took the place of the deposit shall be observed.\"\u00a0 (Art. 309, Code of Commerce.)<\/blockquote>The defendant has shown no authorization whatsoever or the consent of the depositary for using or disposing of the P2,498, which the certificate acknowledges, or any contract entered into with the depositor to convert the deposit into a loan, commission, or other contract.<br\/><br\/>That demand was not made for restitution\u00a0 of the sum deposited, which could have been claimed on the same or the next day after the certificate was signed, does not operate against the depositor, or signify anything except the intention not to press it.\u00a0 Failure to claim at once or delay for some time in demanding restitution of the thing deposited, which was immediately due, does not imply such permission to use the thing deposited as would convert the deposit into a loan.<br\/><br\/>Article 408 of the Code of Commerce of 1829, previous to the one now in force, provided:<br\/><blockquote>\"The depositary of an amount of money cannot use the amount, and if he makes use of it, he shall be responsible for all damages that may accrue and shall respond to the depositor for the legal interest on the amount.\"<\/blockquote>Whereupon the commentators say:<br\/><blockquote>\"In this case the deposit becomes in fact a loan, as a just punishment imposed upon him who abuses the sacred nature of a deposit and as a means of preventing the desire of gain from leading him into speculations that may be disastrous to the depositor, who is much better secured while the deposit exists than when he only has a personal action for recovery.<br\/><br\/>\"According to article 548, No. 5, of the Penal Code, those who to the prejudice of another appropriate or abstract for their own use money, goods, or other personal property which they may have received as a deposit, on commission, or for, administration, or for any other purpose which produces the obligation of delivering it or returning it, and deny having received it, shall suffer the penalty of the preceding article,\" which punishes such act as the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>.\u00a0 The corresponding article of the Penal Code of the Philippines is 535, No. 5.<br\/><br\/>In a decision of an appeal, September 28, 1895, the principle was laid down that:\u00a0 \"Since\u00a0 he commits the crime of <i>estafa<\/i> under article 548 of the Penal Code of Spain who to another's detriment appropriates to himself or abstracts money or goods received on commission for delivery, the court rightly applied this article to the appellant, who, to the manifest detriment of the owner or owners of the securities, since he has not restored them, willfully and wrongfully disposed of them by appropriating them to himself or at least diverting them from the purpose to which he was charged to devote them.\"<\/blockquote>It is unquestionable that in no sense did the P2,498 which he willfully and wrongfully disposed of to the detriment of his principal, Juana Montilla, and of the depositor, Eugenio Veraguth, belong to the defendant.<br\/><br\/>Likewise erroneous is the construction apparently attempted to be given to two decisions of this Supreme Court (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Dominguez, 2 Phil. Rep., 580, and U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Morales and Morco, 15 Phil. Rep., 236) as implying that what constitutes <i>estafa<\/i> is not the disposal of money deposited, but denial of having received same.\u00a0 In the first of said cases there was no evidence that the defendant had appropriated the grain deposited in his possession.<br\/><blockquote>\"On the contrary, it is entirely probable that, after the departure of the defendant from Libmanan on September 20, 1898, two days after the uprising of the civil guard in Nueva Caceres, the rice was seized by the revolutionists and appropriated to their own uses.\"<\/blockquote>In this connection it was held that failure to return the thing deposited was not sufficient, but that it was necessary to prove\u00a0 that the depositary had appropriated it to himself or diverted the\u00a0 deposit to his own or another's benefit.\u00a0 He was accused of refusing to restore, and it was held that the code does not penalize refusal to restore but denial of having received. So much for the crime of omission; now with reference to the crime of commission, it was not held in that decision that appropriation or\u00a0 diversion of the thing deposited would not constitute the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>In the second of said decisions, the accused \"kept none of the proceeds of the sales.\u00a0 Those, such as they were, he turned over to the owner;\" and there being no proof of the appropriation, the agent could not be found guilty of the crime of <i>estafa<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Being in accord with law and the merits of the case, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

however, there can hardly be any doubt that it was a part of the money which his uncle had in the trunk.\u00a0 At the trial the defendants denied that they were the authors of the crime; Olea and Diris denied that they were present at the house on the morning in question; and Eustaquio Siaga,\u00a0 while admitting that he was at the tienda stated that he went there alone.\u00a0 The presence of the defendants at the house on the morning in question is not only established by the wife of Fulgencio Seal, but her testimony on this point is corroborated by that of Conrado Fernandez, a neighbor.\u00a0 In view of all the facts of record the statements of the defendants cannot be credited.\u00a0 Their guilt is conclusively established.<br\/><br\/>Olea having withdrawn his appeal and the other evidence of record being sufficient in itself to sustain the conviction of all the appellants, it is not necessary for us to discuss the objections set forth in their brief as to the admission of the alleged confession of guilt of Olea.<br\/><br\/>It has been suggested by counsel, that the defendant Eustaquio Siaga, who remained below in the tienda and engaged the woman in conversation while the other defendants went up into the house, should only be held as a <i>complice<\/i> (accessary before the fact) as defined in the Penal Code, and not as a principal.\u00a0 In support of this view we are cited to Viada (Vol. I, p. 370), as follows: \"The person who entertains the owner of a house while robbers are assaulting it, so that he will not return thereto until after the robbery has been consummated, is also an accomplice in the crime, inasmuch as he cooperated therein by a simultaneous act, although not an indispensable one for its accomplishment.\"<br\/><br\/>It will be seen however that the case supposed by the noted commentator clearly implies that the owner of the house was entertained at some distance from the place where the robbery was committed; it does not appear how far away, but apparently not anywhere in the immediate neighborhood.\u00a0 The present case offers a different situation.\u00a0 The defendant Siaga acted concurrently with the other defendants, and must be held to have been present with them aiding and abetting them in the commission of the crime by remaining below and talking with the woman in order to distract her attention from what was going on upstairs.\u00a0 In doing so he was\u00a0 evidently serving as a guard to warn his companions in case there should arise any necessity for giving an alarm.\u00a0 When the other defendants came down out of the house he went away with them.<br\/><br\/>This court has repeatedly held that one who shares the guilty purpose and aids and abets the commission of a crime by his presence at the time of its perpetration, even though he may not have taken an active part in its material execution, is guilty as a principal.\u00a0 We have\u00a0 also held that one who stands as guard near the place where a crime is committed to keep others away or to warn his companions and fellow conspirators of danger of discovery, takes a direct part in the commission of the crime and is therefore guilty as a principal under article 13 of the Penal Code.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Reogilon and Dingle, 22 Phil. Rep., 127; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Balisacan, 4 Phil. Rep., 545; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Ramos, 4 Phil. Rep., 555.)<br\/><br\/>Under all the circumstances of the case we are satisfied that Siaga was properly convicted as a principal.<br\/><br\/>It appears that the trial court treated the stolen receipts for P100 as being of that value.\u00a0 The actual money stolen amounted to only P353.<br\/><br\/>While we have\u00a0 held that checks, warrants and similar instruments, payable to order and evidencing an obligation to pay money, may under certain circumstances be\u00a0 treated as\u00a0 worth their face value in fixing the value of the stolen property for the purpose of grading the crime and the penalty to be imposed on conviction, in cases wherein the penalty prescribed in the Code is made to depend on the value of the property taken (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Raboy, 25 Phil. Rep., 1;\u00a0 U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Wickersham, 20 Phil. Rep., 440), we are of opinion that a mere receipt such as that under consideration, especially in the absence of any proof as to its value, cannot be held to have anything more than a mere nominal value in fixing the penalty and assessing the civil indemnity to be imposed on one convicted of its theft.<br\/><br\/>The record further shows that Anselmo Diris is a recidivist, having been previously convicted of the crime of robbery by the Court of First Instance of Tayabas in the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Anselmo Diris, on April 12, 1904, which judgment\u00a0 of conviction was affirmed by this Court on May 9, 1905 (4 PhiL Rep., 498).<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the trial court should be modified, in so far as it affects these appellants, by reducing the amount of the civil indemnification from P453 to P353 and by substituting the words <i>presidio mayor<\/i> for the words <i>prision mayor<\/i> in the dispositive part thereof, and thus modified the judgment convicting and sentencing the appellants Diris and Siaga should be and is hereby affirmed, with a proportionate share of the costs of this instance against each of the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Jose (6 Phil Rep., 589).<br\/><br\/>We do not believe that either of these\u00a0 contentions is sound.\u00a0 The municipality, having used this land for so many years for <i public=\"\" purposes=\"\" recognized=\"\"><\/i>, which have for their basis' a public necessity, undisturbed and unchallenged, a grant in its favor will be presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the Municipality of Catbalogan <i>vs<\/i>. The Director of Lands (17 Phil. Rep., 216), the court said at page 226:<br\/><blockquote>\"Under these principles, perfectly in accord with both the old and the mother legislation of this country, the municipality of Catbalogan ought to be considered as the owner of the land in question, on account of the same having been awarded to it as its own, under its exclusive ownership, on the founding of the pueblo, for the erection of the courthouse, the record of the case showing no proof nor data to the contrary.\u00a0 As the plaintiff municipality, the applicant, has been occupying the property on which its courthouse is situated during such a long space of time, much longer than that required for extraordinary prescription (art. 1959 of the Civil Code), it cannot be denied that the presumption exists, in its favor, that it has been holding the land in its character of owner, since the trial record exhibits no proof that any other parcel of land, distinct from that in controversy, was awarded to the said municipality for the erection thereon of its courthouse, a court-house and the land on which to build it being necessary and indispensable for the existence of the pueblo.<br\/><br\/>\"The title under which the municipality of Catbalogan holds and enjoys the said lot is the same as that under which it is recognized as a pueblo and under which the municipality is justified in its present occupancy of the territory where the town is established with its streets, squares, and common lands (terreno comunal), a title identical with that now held by the church,as a religious institution, to the land now occupied by the temple that exists in the said pueblo.\"<\/blockquote>The court further says at page 220: <blockquote> \"For the establishment, then, of new pueblos, the administrative authority of the province, in representation of the Governor-General, designated the territory for their location and extension and the metes and bounds of the same; and before allotting the lands among the new settlers, a special demarcation was made of the places which were to serve as the public square of the pueblo, for the erection of the church, and as sites for the public buildings, among others, the municipal building or the <i>casa real<\/i>, as well as of the lands which were to constitute the commons, pastures, and <i>propios<\/i> of the municipality and the streets and roads which were to intersect the new town were laid out, as may be seen by the following laws:<br\/><br\/>\"Law 7, title 7, book 4, of the Recompilation of the Laws of the Indies, proyides:<br\/><br\/>\" 'The district or territory to be given for settlement by composition shall be allotted in the following manner:\u00a0 There shall first be set apart the portion required for the lots of the pueblo, the <i>exido<\/i> or public lands, and pastures amply sufficient for the stock which the residents may have, and <i>as much more as propios del lugar or common lands of the locality<\/i>;\u00a0 the rest of the territory and district shall be divided into four parts-one of them, of his choice, shall be for him who takes upon himself the obligation to found the pueblo,\u00a0 and the other three shall be apportioned equally among the settlers.'<br\/><br\/>\"Law 8, of the same title and book, prescribes, among other things:<br\/><br\/>\" 'That, between the main square and the church, there shall be constructed the <i>casas reales<\/i> or municipal buildings, the\u00a0 <i>cabildo, concejo<\/i>, customs buildings,' etc.<br\/><br\/>\"Law 14 of the said title and book, also directs among other things:<br\/><br\/>\" 'That the viceroys shall have set aside such lands as to them appear suitable as the common lands <i>(propios)<\/i> of the pueblos that have none, therewith to assist in the payment of the salaries\u00a0 of\u00a0 the <i>corregidores<\/i>,\u00a0 and sufficient public lands (<i>exidos<\/i>) and pasture lands as provided for and prescribed by law.'<br\/><br\/>\"Law 1, title 13 of the aforesaid book, provides the following:<br\/><br\/>\" 'Such viceroys and governors as have due authority shall designate to each <i>villa<\/i> and <i>lugar<\/i> newly founded and settled the <i>lands<\/i> and <i>lots<\/i> which they may need and\u00a0 may be given to them, without detriment to a third party, as <i>propios<\/i>, and a statement shall be sent to us of what was designated and given to each, in order that we may have such action approved.'\"<br\/><\/blockquote>The court also said on page 228 :<br\/><blockquote>\"As has been shown in the preceding paragraphs, the land in litigation, which is a lot occupied by the courthouse, anciently termed the <i>casa real<\/i>, of the pueblo of Catbalogan, pertains to the said pueblo, awarded to the same, not gratuitously, but on account of the necessity arising from its organization, and forms a part, as a patrimonial property, of its municipal assets, and therefore it is not comprised within the common land (<i>terreno comunal<\/i>) which may have been granted to the said pueblo.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of the Municipality of Tacloban <i>vs<\/i>. Director of Lands (17 Phil. Rep., 426, 433), the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The pueblo and municipality of Tacloban, as the capital of the Island and Province of Leyte, must have been one of the first of the pueblos established and of which the said province is composed and there being no record that its <i>casa real<\/i> or municipal courthouse was erected on any other or different land, it is to be presumed that, on founding that pueblo and on the competent authority proceeding to designate and demarcate the area of land to be occupied as a site and for the future extension of the town of Tacloban, with its square, streets, and lots for the temple and other public buildings, the lot in question was\u00a0 also designated for the courthouse, in accordance with the laws hereinbefore mentioned, and in fact the municipal building was erected thereon very long'ago, more that thirty years, according to the witnesses examined, and the municipal president, the applicant, averred that the pueblo of Tacloban had acquired the said lot by donation and had possessed it since time immemorial.\u00a0 It is also to be presumed that the adjudication of the said land in favor of the municipality to enable it to build its courthouse thereon, was duly confirmed by the Spanish Government, as must be inferred, without proof to the contrary, in view of its continuous and peaceable possession for so long a period extending to the present time; nor does the record show that any other lot or different parcel of land was adjudicated to it, in as much as it was necessary and absolutely indispensable that every pueblo established should have its own <i>casa real<\/i> or courthouse, the seat of its local authority, and also a church where its inhabitants might worship God.\" <br\/><\/blockquote>On page 439 appears the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"Taking into account that neither the courthouse of a pueblo nor its schoolhouses were constructed outside the town proper, at a distance from its inhabitants, the existence on the said land of two public schoolhouses, erected a great many years ago and used for purposes of instruction of children of both sexes residing in Tacloban, supports the characterization of the property as being private (<i>bien propio<\/i>), or part of the municipal assets, which is the status of the aforementioned land, and therefore the lot on which the said municipal building and schoolhouses are built is not a part of an <i>exido dehesa<\/i> (public pasturage) or <i>terreno comunal<\/i> (common), because such lands could only be situated outside of the town, in accordance with the provisions contained in laws 13 and 14, title 7, and 12 and 14, title 12, book 4, and law 8, title 3, book 6, of the Recompilation of the Laws of the Indies, and in No. 53 of the royal ordinances of February 26, 1768.\"<\/blockquote>On page 439 the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It having been provided in article 3 of the said royal decree of December 20, 1863, that there should be at least one school for males and another for females in each pueblo of these Islands, it was prescribed in article 7, preinserted herein, that the salary of the teachers, the establishment of the school, the acquisition and preservation of school material and supplies, and the rental of the building, where there was no public one for the purpose, should constitute an obligatory expenditure to be paid out of the respective local appropriation.\u00a0 By this legal, administrative provision it is recognized that in some pueblos there are\u00a0 public-school buildings, as in the case of the pueblo of Tacloban, due to the zeal and patriotism of their principal residents; arid it must be concluded that the courthouse and the two schoolhouses aforementioned, together with the land on which\u00a0 they are erected, are, for lack of proof to the contrary, the private property of and belong to the said municipality and form a part of its municipal funds and assets.\"<\/blockquote>On page 442 appears the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"In accordance with these principles, which harmonize perfectly with both the old and the modern legislation of this country, and taking into consideration the spirit underlying the Laws of the Indies, and the purposes and tendencies of their\u00a0 provisions, ever favorable to the original holders of the land where, under the Spanish sovereignty, new towns were organized, the municipality of Tacloban ought to be considered as the owner of the land on which the municipal building and two schoolhouses, of a public character, were erected, on account of having been\u00a0 awarded to it as its exclusive property, on the founding of the said pueblo, for the record of the case offers no proof nor data whatever contrary to such award or grant.\u00a0 As the said municipality, the applicant, has been occupying the property by its own buildings during such a long space of time, much longer than that required for extraordinary prescription (art. 1959, Civil Code), it cannot be denied\u00a0 that the presumption exists in its favor, that it has been holding the land in its character of owner, since the trial record exhibits no proof that any other parcel of land, distinct from that in controversy, was awarded to the said municipality for the erection thereon of its courthouse and school, a church, schools, and a municipal building being necessary and indispensable for the normal existence of a regularly constituted pueblo.<br\/><br\/>\"The title under which the municipality of Tacloban holds and enjoys the land, the registration of which is in question, is the same as that now recognized to exist in favor of the said pueblo in support of its occupancy of the territory within which the town is established with its streets and squares, a title identical with that held tat the present time by the church, as a religious institution, to the land now occupied by the temple that exists in the said pueblo.\u00a0 The grant and demarcation of the land to be occupied by the town, as well as the distribution and allotment of the parcels thereof which were to constitute its squares and streets and those to be occupied by the church, the municipal and other public buildings, and also of the parcels to be apportioned among its first\u00a0 settlers, must all have been set forth in a record made at the beginning, and that record must have been preserved at least in the archives of the provincial government, since it is improbable that it could have been kept in those of the municipal building, considering the changes wrought by time; wherefore it is not at all strange that the first settlers of a town in formation should lack their respective titles to accredit their ownership to the parcels of land which fell to each of them in the partition made of the lots, for in those remote times fewer records were kept, the archipelago was sparsely populated and there were abundant lands for distribution, for which reasons the mere fact of the erection of a church, the municipal building, and schools, carries with it the presumption that the land on which they are built was allotted to the church and to the municipality for the public service.\u00a0 No proof whatever was offered at trial against such a presumption, and therefore there exists no legal ground nor equitable reason why the right of the municipality of Tacloban to the land in question ought not to be respected, a right of ownership consecrated by the laws of every civilized country for the benefit of society, of public order, and of civilization itself.<br\/><br\/>\"In view of the facts logically and justly supposed and of the legal grounds above noted, it is of course shown that the municipality of Tacloban, as an administrative entity susceptible of rights and duties, has no need to rely upon the right that is derived from prescription in order that it may be held and reputed to be the owner of the land or lot on which buildings belonging to it are erected, for the construction of which the said land was assigned and adjudicated to it when the pueblo was founded, as has been amply proven in the preceding paragraphs.\"<\/blockquote>From these quotations it is clear that, where the municipality has used the land for the purposes specified from time immemorial, a grant from the state in favor of the municipality will be presumed.\u00a0 The land, however, to be susceptible of that presumption must have been used for recognized public purposes,\u00a0 based upon a public necessity in relation to which the Government was wont to grant lands to municipalities in former times.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the Municipality of Tacloban <i>vs<\/i>. Director of Lands (18 Phil. Rep., 201), it was held that:<br\/><blockquote>\"When, on the part of a municipality petitioning for the inscription of land, it is not shown that the land was granted by the Government to the municipality to form a part of the municipal assets or estate, or that a municipal building was erected thereon for public purposes, a circumstance which would have led to the presumption that, in obtaining permission to erect the building it also obtained a grant of the land, express or implied, from the Government, the municipality cannnot be considered as the proprietor of the land with a right to inscribe the same in the property registry.\"<\/blockquote>It was also held in that case that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The mere fact that a municipality continued to collect revenues or rentals from the residents who occupy any parcel of land comprised within its district, is not proof that the said municipality is the proprietor of such\u00a0 realty; at the most, it might be considered to be a usufructuary of the land in question, but without the right to enter it in the property registry.\"<\/blockquote>It was further held that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The benefit granted by article 54 of Act No, 926, for the purpose of fostering agriculture and increasing the wealth of the country, cannot be deemed to be granted, according to economic principles, to municipal corporations which, on account of their special conditions, the idiosyncrasy and character of the functions which they exercise, and, because of the administrative mission which they have to fulfill in the name of the Government and in representation of the people who elected them, cannot engage in agriculture and other industries nor can they attend to the administration of agricultural land and give particular attention to strictly private business, without serious detriment to the interests of the community.\"<\/blockquote>It is apparent from these quotations that, as we have said before,\u00a0 in order that the municipality may rely upon a presumed grant from the State in its favor, the land concerning which the grant is to be presumed must have been used by the municipality for the purposes specified\u00a0 in said quotations, namely, to meet a public necessity, and\u00a0 therefore must be land which would have been originally granted by the State for such purposes. In other words, the lands susceptible of this presumption cannot be agricultural or communal lands; they must be lands which the municipality itself can exclusively own, i. e., they must be lands used to meet a public necessity.<br\/><br\/>Although the decisions mentioned do not refer to municipal markets as one of the purposes for which the State granted land to municipalities, that does not militate against our finding that the purposes for which land could have been granted to municipalities by the State as specified in those decisions are not all of the purposes for which the State could., or did, grant land to municipalities. There is at least one other purpose\u00a0 which may be considered to be based upon a public necessity for which the State could have granted, and did grant, lands to the municipalities, namely, for public markets.\u00a0 In many parts of the Islands, formerly as now, municipal markets were, and are, in a very real sense public necessities.\u00a0 While, from the strict standpoint of necessity, there is undoubtedly a difference between a courthouse, for example, and a municipal market, still it is one of degree rather than of kind; and where it appears, as in this case, that a public market was a necessity of the municipality, that the land has been the site of such market for time out of mind, and is still dedicated to such use, the presumption of a grant from the State arises.<br\/><br\/>As to the claim that the land is part of the public square, we do not think it well founded in the evidence.\u00a0 The court below found against the contention, upon the ground that the land was occupied as aforesaid and that it was separated from the public square by a street.\u00a0 While one of the witnesses for the petitioner stated that it was a part of the public square, he thereafter amended his testimony so as to say that it was a <i>continuation<\/i> of the public square.<br\/><br\/>As to the other parcel of land, there is no question on this\u00a0 appeal.<br\/><br\/>We think that the decision of the court below was well founded and therefore affirm\u00a0 it, without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

L, from September 1, 1908 (Exhibit A), to December 31, 1911.\u00a0 On October 25, 1909, one Jose Fernandez sold and delivered to the colony 3 head of cattle of the value of P135.\u00a0 (Exhibit C and testimony, p. 6.)\u00a0 On October 31, 1909, a reimbursement warrant for P135, the value of the said 3 head of cattle, was issued by the Bureau of Prisons, and credited in the defendant's account.\u00a0 (Exhibit P and testimony, p. 40.)\u00a0 Said amount had never been paid to Jose Fernandez (testimony, p. 6).\u00a0 On October 3, 1910, Jose Fernandez delivered 20 head of cattle to the colony.\u00a0 (Exhibits D, K, N,\u00a0 U, W, and FF, and testimony, pp. 7, 14, 24, 50, 53, 61, 63.)\u00a0 At the time of the delivery of said 20 head of cattle Jose\u00a0 Fernandez claimed payment for the\u00a0 3 head of cattle sold and delivered by him to the colony October\u00a0 25, 1909.\u00a0 The defendant then ordered a voucher for 22 head of cattle (Exhibit D) to be made, covering 2 of the 3 head the payment of which was claimed by Jose Fernandez, and the 20 head sold and delivered to the colony on the date of the voucher.\u00a0 The defendant wanted Jose Fernandez to sell more cattle to the colony, making the number 50.\u00a0 Fernandez could not deliver the remaining 30 right away on account of the\u00a0 rains.\u00a0 The defendant said he could deliver them later, and to save time he ordered a voucher for 30 head of cattle (Exhibit E) to be made on the same date (testimony, pp. 6, 7, 14, 50, 51).\u00a0 On November 16, 1910, the\u00a0 defendant sent for Jose Fernandez and told him that he was going to pay him for the 22 head of cattle which he had already delivered, which the defendant did, after having Fernandez indorse\u00a0 a warrant in the office and in the presence of the provincial treasurer and cashing the warrant, giving him P986.\u00a0 The warrant so indorsed and cashed was for P2,336 covering the vouchers for 22\u00a0 and 30 head, and was issued to Jose Fernandez and received by the defendant (testimony, pp. 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, 23, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 40, 46, and Exhibit F).\u00a0 On November 17, 1910,\u00a0 Jose Fernandez did neither sell nor deliver to the colony the 28 head of cattle which appear on voucher Exhibit G, nor did he receive the amount of M,260 (Exhibit Q) in payment thereof.\u00a0 The defendant received said amount as shown by his indorsement on Exhibit Q (testimony, pp. 9, 14, 40, 63, and Exhibits K, N, U, V, W, GG and KK).\u00a0 On November 28, 1910, Jose Fernandez delivered to the colony 29 head of cattle, which, together with the 1 head of the 3 the colony owed him in 1909, completed the delivery of the 30 called for in the voucher Exhibit E.\u00a0 Jose Fernandez had never received payment for the said 30 head the value of which was P1,350.\u00a0 This amount was included in the warrant Exhibit F which was cashed by the defendant on November 16, 1910.\u00a0 On February 28,\u00a0 1911, the defendant had a voucher for 45 head (Exhibit M) prepared; but the same was canceled as it was found by his successor, Mr. Vance, to cover cattle already delivered to and paid for by the colony (testimony, pp. 33, 34, 54, 55, 60 and Exhibits L and M).\u00a0 Changes have been made in\u00a0 the daily and monthly reports of the division of animal industry after they had been submitted to the defendant, for the ostensible purpose of confusing the items and making it difficult to detect the fraud.\u00a0 The most important of said changes are those made in Exhibits X, EE, and FF (testimony, pp.\"69, 75, 76, 85).\u00a0 The defendant was seen making changes on Exhibits EE and FF and working on a sheet of drawing paper Exhibit GG in the month of November, 1911 (testimony, pp. 79, 80, 82, 84, 85).\"<\/blockquote>The principal\u00a0 witness on whom the prosecution relied at the trial, without whose testimony the prosecution would have failed utterly to make out a case, was one Jose M. Fernandez, who, as will be seen from the foregoing, had an interest amounting to P1,485 in maintaining the charge set forth in the information that public funds had been appropriated to his own use by the defendant.\u00a0 Discussing the testimony of this witness in his brief in this court, the Acting Attorney-General makes the following observations:<br\/><blockquote>\"An unsuccessful attempt has been made to impeach the testimony of Jose M. Fernandez by producing contradictory affidavits made by him before the trial.\u00a0 The contradictions are mostly due to confusion in the numbers.\u00a0 As to the denial by Jose Fernandez of having signed a warrant for P2,336, it is explained by the fact that when he signed Exhibit F he believed that he was signing a warrant for the payment of 22 head of cattle (testimony, p. 24), and this was natural because when the defendant sent for him he told him that he was going to pay him for the 22 head.\u00a0 The testimony of Jose M. Fernandez in the trial is strongly corroborated by other witnesses and by documents which have been introduced and admitted in evidence.\u00a0 To impeach the character of Fernandez, an attempt was made to show that he had been convicted of stealing cattle from the colony.\u00a0 Governor John H. Evans testified that while an investigation was started in the matter, the case was abandoned and no prosecution was made (testimony, p. 107).\u00a0 And innocence is always presumed, until the contrary is shown beyond reasonable doubt.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"It is also contended by the appellant that the receipts on vouchers Exhibits C, D, E, and G, having been signed by Jose M. Fernandez, it is presumed that he had received the amounts thereof, in the absence of deceit.\u00a0 The signature to the receipts on Government vouchers cannot always be taken as evidence of\u00a0 payment, because the general practice is that receipts on vouchers are signed by the creditor before receiving the money.\u00a0 As to Exhibit G, while the signing of the receipt thereon by Jose M. Fernandez carries with it the\u00a0 presumption that he had sold the cattle appearing thereon to the colony, yet we have the positive testimony of Jose M. Fernandez, supported by the other witnesses and by the records of the colony, that he had never sold 28 head of cattle to the colony on November 17, 1910.\u00a0 On pages 9 and 14 of the testimony, Fernandez states that once he was required to sign some blank vouchers for the sale of coconuts.\u00a0 This explains why the signature of Jose M. Fernandez happened to appear on said voucher for 28 head of cattle which he neither sold nor delivered to the colony.<br\/><br\/>\"The same contention is made by the appellant as to warrant Exhibit F.\u00a0 But we have already shown that when Fernandez signed it he was acting under the belief that he was signing a warrant for P986 for the 22 head of cattle for which the defendant told him he would pay him, as he did.\u00a0 Fernandez had confidence in the defendant and never suspected that he was indorsing a warrant for P2,336 instead of a warrant for P986, all that was due him at the time, and which he actually received.\"<\/blockquote>Having in mind the very substantial monetary interest this witness had in establishing the guilt of the defendant, we think that these admissions and explanations of the Attorney-General as to his conduct and testimony are in themselves sufficient to justify us in holding that a conviction should not be maintained on his testimony in the absence of corroborative evidence of the most convincing and unimpeachable character.\u00a0 That he made several contradictory affidavits touching the very matters testified to by him at the trial in the court below is admitted, and even if it be granted, as claimed by the prosecution, that these \"contradictions are mostly due to confusion in the numbers,\" they are certainly sufficient to raise a grave doubt as to the accuracy if not the veracity of the witness.\u00a0 The case for the prosecution rests largely on evidence introduced for the purpose of establishing the exact number of animals purchased and accounted for by the defendant in the course of a series of transactions extending over a considerable period of time.\u00a0 It will readily be seen therefore that the possibility that Fernandez may have been as \"confused\" and inaccurate \"as to numbers\" while on the witness stand as he admittedly was when he made these affidavits, vitally affects his credibility as the principal witness in this case.\u00a0 Furthermore, a cursory examination of the various affidavits made by this witness prior to the trial satisfies us that the contradictory statements made by him, under oath, and with reference to matters pertinent to these proceedings, are by no means limited to those which might have been occasioned by a \"confusion of numbers;\" and are such as to raise at least a reasonable doubt as to his veracity as well as his accuracy while on the witness stand.\u00a0 His explanations of the fact that his name appears indorsed on Exhibit F are in the highest degree unsatisfactory.\u00a0 This was a warrant for P2,336 on account of which he claims he only received P986.\u00a0 He testified that when he indorsed this warrant he thought it was a warrant for P986 on account of a delivery of 22 head of cattle, and that he did not notice that it was a warrant for a much larger sum.\u00a0 He says that he indorsed it without examining it because he relied implicitly on the statements of the defendant\u00a0 and did not suspect that he was being imposed upon.\u00a0 It appears\u00a0 however that he was a\u00a0 fairly intelligent man and accustomed to handling Government vouchers of this kind.\u00a0 The warrant in question is a very simple instrument indeed, and clearly sets forth the fact that it was made in payment of two separate deliveries of cattle, and it is not easy to understand how even the most careless and credulous indorser could have failed to notice that it evidenced a payment of P2,336 and not a payment of P986.\u00a0 It was indorsed, and payment\u00a0 (either in whole or in part) made on account of it, in the\u00a0 office of the provincial treasurer of Palawan, who was there present; and it is almost beyond belief that the defendant would have undertaken to perpetrate so bold and reckless a fraud under such conditions in the absence of collusion between himself and the treasurer; but as will appear hereafter, the\u00a0 existence of such a fraudulent secret agreement is not even suggested in the record, and on the contrary the treasurer was called by the prosecution and with manifest frankness and truth related all that he knew in regard to the transaction, in a manner which leaves\u00a0 no reason to believe that he had the slightest desire to shield the accused, or to conceal anything which occurred on that occasion.<br\/><br\/>Fernandez' explanation as to the way in which his admittedly genuine indorsement was secured to the voucher for the 28 head of cattle which he claims he did not deliver (Exhibit G) is also somewhat far-fetched, though it is perhaps rather more reasonable than that given in regard to the indorsement of the warrant\u00a0 for P2,336 to which reference has just been made.\u00a0 He claims that having: sold some coconuts to the colony he signed the voucher therefor in blank, and that this voucher signed in blank was thereafter filled out, without his knowledge, so as to evidence a delivery of 28 head of cattle.\u00a0 There is\u00a0 nothing1 inherently impossible or improbable about this explanation of his signature attached to the voucher in question if it be assumed that the accused had formed a deliberate plan to misappropriate the funds of the colony; but his testimony as to the circumstances under which he signed the blank voucher is in the highest degree unsatisfactory, and is not of that convincing quality which should\u00a0 mark the oral statements of a witness who undertakes to explain away the natural inferences and conclusions to be drawn from documentary evidence submitted in the course of a criminal proceeding.<br\/><br\/>The accused was shown at the trial to have been a Government official whose services during a period of more than ten years in responsible and important offices had always been highly satisfactory, and whose record up to the time when these proceedings were instituted was apparently above suspicion.\u00a0 His conviction in this case can only be maintained by accepting as true the story told at the trial by this interested witness, and while we are not prepared to hold that this story is false, we do not feel that we would be justified in entering a solemn judgment holding it to be true, beyond a reasonable doubt, in the absence of corroborative evidence of the most convincing character.<br\/><br\/>The corroborative evidence introduced by the prosecution consists of the testimony of several witnesses as to certain matters testified to by Fernandez, and of documentary evidence including reports, records, accounts, and vouchers, the true meaning and import of which the prosecution sought to develop with the aid of\u00a0 expert accountants.<br\/><br\/>Aside from the documentary evidence, the main reliance of the prosecution in corroboration of the story of Fernandez is to be found in the testimony of the witnesses Johnson and Mendigoren.\u00a0 But the credibility of both these witnesses was successfully impeached in the court below, and their testimony falls far short of inspiring that degree of confidence in the story told by Fernandez which we hold to be necessary to justify us in maintaining a judgment of conviction in a criminal case.<br\/><br\/>Johnson at the time when he testified was a member of the Iwahig penal colony serving a sentence for embezzlement.\u00a0 Speaking of this witness the acting governor of the Province of Palawan, Mr. John H. Evans, testified with apparent reluctance as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q.\u00a0 Will you state to the court your opinion of Johnson as regards integrity, character, and responsibility as you know from your own personal knowledge?\u2014A.\u00a0 That is a thing I rather object to answering unless the court orders it answered, because I hate to take a person's character away or to attack it or say what I think of him, unless it has a particular bearing on the case.<br\/><br\/>\"The Court (to witness).\u00a0 I direct you to answer the question.\u2014A.\u00a0 As a man I would not trust his integrity, because I have known him to misstate facts deliberately.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Have known him to deliberately and maliciously misstate facts regarding Mr. Lamb since Mr. Lamb left the penal colony?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes.\"<\/blockquote>This testimony was admitted at the trial without objection, and despite its manifest irregularity in form and substance it is sufficient, when taken together with the admitted fact that the witness was serving\u00a0 sentence for the crime of embezzlement at the very time when he testified, to justify us in receiving his testimony doubtfully and to impose upon us the duty of scrutinizing it with painstaking care and even with suspicion, in so far as it tends to destroy the good name and fame of a former superintendent of the penal institution wherein the witness had served a part of his sentence.\u00a0 The importance of the testimony of this witness to the case made out by the prosecution and its vital relation to the testimony of the principal witness Fernandez which has already been commented upon, will readily appear from an examination of the following extract from an official report prepared some time prior to the trial by Mr. A. K. Hitchcock, district auditor, which appears on page 138 of the record:<br\/><blockquote>\"Mr. Fernandez made two sworn statements about the matter before me.\u00a0 The first one made was evidently confused with later deliveries of cattle made and his memory as to the dates when the events transpired was so faulty that the statement was practically worthless.<br\/><br\/>\"I returned to Iwahig and got from the Mr. Johnson referred to above a comparatively clear statement of the facts and immediately\u00a0 returned to Puerto Princesa.<br\/><br\/>\"Mr. Fernandez was again called in and informed that the statement made before me was apparently very faulty as to the dates and the exact circumstances under which the transactions occurred, and he was advised that if he had any book or memoranda upon the matter to which he could refer to correct these errors he would be allowed to make another statement.\u00a0 This was done and his second statement coincides practically with the statement made by Mr. Johnson.\"<\/blockquote>As to the witness Mendigoren a strong suspicion if not a certainty of the falsity of his testimony, in part at least, is raised by undisputed evidence in the record tending to prove, though not conclusively, that notebooks of the style of the one in which he claims to have entered certain vital memoranda had not been introduced into the colony until after the date when he swore that he made the original entries; and by the further fact that the two written records which he claimed were entered by him and to which he was allowed to refer in order to refresh his memory, give strong internal evidence of having been prepared by different hands.\u00a0 A careful examination of the testimony of this witness leaves little room for doubt that he was primarily interested in furnishing corroborative evidence as to the statements made by the witness Fernandez, and only secondarily interested in disclosing the truth as to the facts in reference to which he testified and as to the source of his knowledge in regard thereto.<br\/><br\/>Aside from the documentary evidence and the testimony in connection therewith, the only evidence of any real value tending to corroborate the testimony of Fernandez other than that of Johnson and Mendigoren, is the testimony of the witness Clark.\u00a0 Clark was the treasurer of the Province of Palawan, and there is no reason to doubt the truth of his testimony.\u00a0 But while his testimony undoubtedly tends to corroborate the claim of Fernandez that he did not receive the full amount of the above-mentioned\u00a0 warrant for P2,336, it is by no means conclusive of that fact, and viewed from some standpoints it tends in some degree to rebut the charge that there was anything improper in the transaction, so far as Lamb was concerned.\u00a0 Clark was present at the time when the voucher Exhibit F was indorsed in his office by Fernandez, and he says that he saw the accused count over a part of the proceeds, he could not say how much, and deliver it to Fernandez.\u00a0 He could not say what was done with the rest of the money, and he does not appear to have had his attention\u00a0 directed especially to the transaction.\u00a0 Both Fernandez and the accused testified that the sum of P986 was paid on account of the 22 head of cattle; Fernandez claiming that that was all that was paid him and the accused insisting that after counting out this amount, he afterwards counted out the balance in settlement of the amount due\u00a0 on account of 29 or 30 head of cattle delivered on another occasion.\u00a0 It will be seen that the real difference between Fernandez and Lamb is limited to the second transaction, and as to this Clark was unable to testify.\u00a0 He admitted that he did not know what was done with the balance of the money, which remained after Lamb counted out the amount due on account of the delivery of 22 head of cattle, and he does not seem to have heard the discussion between Fernandez and Lamb in which it was agreed that the sum of P986 counted out at that time, was on account of these animals.\u00a0 But that some such a discussion arose at the time when this payment was made there can be no doubt, for both Lamb and Fernandez are in agreement on that point.\u00a0 Manifestly it would not be safe to accept Clark's statement that he only saw a part of the money paid over, as a complete corroboration of Fernandez' denial of Lamb's assertion that after the payment on account of the 22 head had been discussed and settled, the parties then took up and discussed the payment to be made on account of the 29 or 30 head of cattle which Fernandez had delivered on another occasion, after which the balance of the proceeds of the warrant was paid over in settlement therefor.\u00a0 Lamb's explanation of his object in proceeding\" in this way is not unreasonable.\u00a0 He says that as the warrant was drawn to cover two separate transactions, he thought it would avoid confusion to turn over the amount involved in each transaction separately, and thus prevent misunderstanding between himself and Fernandez.<br\/><br\/>The prosecution lays great stress on Clark's testimony to the effect that Lamb told him before the check was cashed that Fernandez was not to receive all the money, taken in connection with a letter which Lamb wrote to the Director of Prisons requesting that this warrant be sent through him.\u00a0 But while this evidence undoubtedly tends to support Fernandez' claim that he did not receive all the money it is by no means, conclusive upon this point, nor does it, as contended by the prosecution, conclusively establish the existence of criminal intent in the mind of the accused.\u00a0 In the first place it was shown at the trial that it was not unusual, in the administration of the affairs of the colony, to arrange to have payments made in the mode adopted on this occasion; in the second place, there seems to have been some question as to the precise number of the animals delivered and on account of which the warrant was prepared, and when Lamb told Clark that he did not want to indorse the warrant over to Fernandez, and preferred to get it cashed and to pay the amount due in cash\u2014because \"Fernandez was not to get all the money\"\u2014he might well have had it in mind that as a result of his settlement with Fernandez, it might develop that he was not entitled to be paid the full amount of the warrant; and finally, as we have remarked before, it is difficult to believe that if Lamb had any criminal intent in having the amount of this warrant paid through him, and if it was his purpose to deceive Fernandez as to its amount and feloniously to misappropriate and to keep for himself the greater part of it, he would have invited Clark's attention to the\u00a0 fact that all the money was not to be paid to Fernandez, and then attempt to perpetrate so bold a swindle in Clark's office, with Clark there present and in position to see and hear all that took place had he happened to have his attention directed to the transaction.<br\/><br\/>If Lamb did in fact appropriate this money, the only reasonable explanation of his conduct in this regard would seem to be that the intent to commit the crime was not formed until afterwards, and that at the time when he paid Fernandez for the 22 head of cattle, he retained the balance in perfect good faith because Fernandez had not yet delivered the other 30 head, or for some other sufficient reason.\u00a0 But this explanation is wholly incompatible with Fernandez' account of the transaction, as, if Fernandez is to be believed, Lamb must have willfully deceived him as to the amount of the warrant, and no reason suggests itself for his doing so unless he had already formulated his plan to misappropriate the amount which Fernandez claims was not paid to him.<br\/><br\/>Some additional testimony was taken tending to corroborate the story told by Fernandez, but except in so far as such testimony relates to, or\u00a0 derives its force from the documentary evidence, we do not deem it of vital importance, and from what has been said as to the testimony of the principal witnesses upon whom the prosecution relies in direct corroboration of Fernandez, we think it sufficiently appears that it falls far short of furnishing corroborative evidence of \"the most convincing and unimpeachable character,\" without which, as we have said, we would not be justified in accepting Fernandez' story as true, beyond a reasonable doubt.<br\/><br\/>A considerable amount of documentary evidence was introduced by the prosecution, but this evidence, reduced to its last analysis, derives its chief value from the daily, monthly, and annual cattle reports of the colony.\u00a0 These cattle reports purport to show the daily, monthly, and annual increases by purchase and births, and decreases by slaughter or disease.\u00a0 With the aid of an expert accountant from the office of the Insular Auditor, the prosecution undertook to show from a analysis of these cattle reports that there was a shortage in the number\u00a0 of animals turned over by the accused to his successor exactly equal to the number which Fernandez testified had not been delivered by him although vouchers purporting to evidence a purchase of that number had been prepared and submitted by the accused.<br\/><br\/>We have carefully examined these cattle reports in connection with the testimony of the witnesses, and we are forced to the conclusion that for the purposes for which they were offered in this case they are so manifestly unreliable that a judgment of conviction based wholly or in large part upon them should not be maintained.\u00a0 Changes have evidently been made in these reports, and the Attorney-General submits an ingenious and, it must be\u00a0 admitted, a forceful argument to show that these changes were made by the accused for the purpose of concealing his misappropriation of the cattle funds of the colony.\u00a0 But an examination of the reports shows that changes and corrections have been made in these reports which do not appear to have any possible connection with the charges against the accused; and these as well as those discussed by the Acting Attorney-General are so clumsily, crudely, and blunderingly executed as to raise at least a doubt that an intelligent, well-educated man, such as the accused was shown to be, could have made use of so transparent a device in an attempt to conceal his misconduct.\u00a0 Several witnesses were called who testified that they saw the accused examining these accounts on one occasion or another, but none of them were able to testify directly that they saw him making the changes which appear on the face of the reports or to any matter which would justify the inference that he did so.\u00a0 Manifestly, such evidence has little probative value in this connection, for the accused, as superintendent of the colony, had a right and even a duty to examine the reports at any time he thought proper to do so.\u00a0 The changes and corrections in the reports may well be accounted for by the fact that the clerks and others who had charge of their preparation were, for the most part, prisoners serving sentence in the colony, who do not seem to have been expert accountants, and who may have had a sinister purpose in thus destroying the usefulness of the reports as a check on their own connection with the cattle transactions of the colony.\u00a0 If we could assume that the defendant is guilty of the crime of misappropriation with which he is charged, it might well be inferred that he made these changes in order to hide his guilt\u2014but we cannot assume, without satisfactory proof, that he falsified the reports in order to draw therefrom an inference as to his guilt of the crime with which he is charged.<br\/><br\/>As the officer ultimately responsible for the preparation and conservation of these reports we might, perhaps, be justified in holding that the fact that they appear to be so utterly useless and unreliable is in itself a suspicious circumstance, indicating a sinister intent on his part to conceal the facts which they should disclose, were it not that it appears from the record that for a considerable part of the time covered by the reports he was a desperately ill man, and that for\u00a0 much of this time he was absent from the colony; and further, that he was compelled to rely on the aid of unskilled and not altogether trustworthy\u00a0 convicts in keeping and preparing the records of the cattle transactions of\u00a0 the colony.\u00a0 Under the circumstances we are not prepared to draw any inferences unfavorable to the accused, from the fact that the reports in question serve rather to befog than to clarify the issues involved in this case.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Shafer, an expert property accountant, made a summarized statement or report of the colony's cattle transactions prior to October 31, 1911, a part of which is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"To date, October 31, 1911, our accounts show 395 head of native cattle at the colony, less 12 slaughtered for subsistence during October, 1911, which have not been credited to date.\u00a0 This leaves 383 to be accounted for.\u00a0 My inventory under date of October 31, 1911, shows 353 <i>head<\/i> including some 78 calves and all young branded cattle.\u00a0 The young branded cattle include 11 calves\u00a0 purchased in January and April of this year.\u00a0 The affidavit of Doctor Best above mentioned in connection with carabao, shows some 217 head of cattle including calves as having died during the year ending June 30, 1910.\u00a0 If this was credited it would account for 217 plus 353 head on hand, or\u00a0 570 head, leaving a margin of 187 head to apply to the natural increase of the herd as Iwahig is charged with 383 head as noted.\u00a0 <i>I attempted to determine the actual status of native cattle by the daily cattle reports but could not do so as these reports are so confused as to make a definite statement impossible.\"<\/i><\/blockquote>Mr. Hitchcock, an expert accountant from the Auditor's office, also\u00a0 submitted a statement, or summarized report of the cattle transactions of the colony; and it is upon deductions drawn from his testimony in connection therewith that the Acting Attorney-General rests his contention that the facts disclosed by the documentary evidence of record corroborate the story told by the principal witnesses for the prosecution.\u00a0 But Mr. Hitchcock admitted that in compiling his report he relied on information acquired from an examination of the available cattle reports of the colony, of vouchers and other documents and of witnesses.\u00a0 Indeed it is very evident that his report is based in large part on these daily, monthly and annual cattle reports, which Mr. Shafer, another expert accountant, spoke of as \"so confused as to make a definite statement impossible,\" and we may add that some of the data upon which Mr. Hitchcock appears to have relied in arriving at his conclusions were furnished by the very witnesses whose testimony the prosecution sought to corroborate by the introduction of those reports.<br\/><br\/>There is evidence in the record as to admissions on the part of Lamb of the possibility of the existence of indebtedness from the colony to Fernandez, and of assurances on Lamb's part, made to Fernandez, that if on investigation such indebtedness was found to exist, and the Government failed\u00a0 to pay it, he, Lamb, would be personally responsible; but in this connection we think it sufficient to say that, giving the accused the benefit of the doubt, there is no satisfactory proof in the record of conduct or admissions on the part of the accused incompatible with his claim of innocence of the offense charged in\u00a0 the information.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, we would say that the prosecution undoubtedly made out a case against the accused, if the testimony of the principal witnesses for the prosecution could be accepted without reserve; but, having in mind the interest and the character of these witnesses, and the undisputed evidence as to his excellent reputation prior to the institution of these proceedings, we cannot maintain a holding that his guilt was proven at the trial beyond a reasonable doubt.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial court should therefore be reversed, and the accused acquitted of the charges set forth in the information, and his bail-bond exonerated, with the costs of both instances <i>de oficio<\/i>.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Moreland<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Torres, J<\/i>., dissents.<\/div>",

S. Lobingier, judge, found that the defendant was not liable to the plaintiff upon the causes of action set forth in the complaint and adjudged that the\u00a0 plaintiff take nothing by his complaint and that the defendant recover his costs.<br\/><br\/>On May 28, 1912, Jose Vaca filed a written complaint with the Court of First Instance of this city, wherein he alleged that, by an instrument ratified on February 15, 1912, before the notary Perfecto Salas, the defendant Kosca took over by purchase all the business assets and liabilities of the special partnership known as\u00a0 M. Kosca &amp; Co., established in this city; that, among the credits that appeared against the assignor-partnership and for which the assignee defendant became liable, was one of P1,571.43, on the date of the assignment, in favor of the plaintiff for loans made to the vendor-partnership; and that in spite of several demands made upon him the defendant had not paid said sum either wholly or in part.\u00a0 As a second cause of action the plaintiff further alleged that, upon the petition of the defendant Kosca and for the benefit and profit of the latter's machine shop, he had ordered lumber from Tuason &amp; Sampedro and as surety guaranteed the payment of the price thereof, which amounted to P414.48, a sum which the defendant had not paid, wherefore fhe plaintiff had to pay it to Tuason &amp; Sampedro, for the defendant not only refused to pay the two aforesaid sums specified in the plaintiff's two causes of action, but also was endeavoring to dispose of his property and to absent himself with the purpose oi; defrauding his creditors, one of whom was the complainant.\u00a0 The plaintiff therefore prayed that judgment be rendered against the defendant for the said sums, amounting to P1,985.91, and the legal interest thereon, that the defendant's property be temporarily attached for an amount necessary to ensure the payment of the judgment, after deposit of the required bond which the plaintiff offered to furnish, and that the defendant be also sentenced to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendant, in his answer, denied each and all of the allegations in the first and second causes of action set out in the complaint, with the exception of the second paragraph thereof.\u00a0 As a special defense he alleged that, on Feburary 15, 1912, he had purchased the machine and carpenter shop of Manuel Ruperto, Nicomedes Constantino, Vicente Gabriel, Ceferino Lorenzana and Juan de los Reyes, representatives of the special partnership\u00a0 known as M. Kosca &amp; Co.; that in April of the same year, by virtue of an agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant and the representatives of the said company, the defendant assigned and conveyed the said shop, together with all his rights, actions and obligations, to Jose Infante, which assignment and sale were approved and consented to by the plaintiff Jose Vaca, as a member of the said partnership of M. Kosca &amp; Co.; that, on the 25th of the same month of April, Jose Infante took possession of the said shop and took over the business\u00a0 thereof, with its assets and liabilities, and assumed the obligation to pay all the debts of the defendant Kosca and those of the partnership M. Kosca &amp;\u00a0 Co., under the terms and conditions recorded in the instrument of sale executed for the purpose by the\u00a0 contracting parties and signed by all the persons interested therein and by the plaintiff himself, Jose Vaca; and that the right of action which the latter exercised in his\u00a0 complaint should be directed against Jose Infante, who was then the owner of the said machine and carpenter shop and had been subrogated in place of the defendant in all the latter's rights, actions and obligations; and he therefore prayed that he be absolved from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Upon the hearing of the case and in view of the evidence adduced therein, the foregoing judgment was rendered, to which counsel for the plaintiff excepted and asked for its annulment and a new trial.\u00a0 This motion being denied, the appellant saved his exception and duly presented the proper bill of exceptions, which was approved, certified\u00a0 and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>In order to decide whether the defendant Manuel Kosca is or is not obligated to pay the sum of P1,985.91, due the plaintiff Jose Vaca from the partnership entitled M. Kosca &amp; Co., as owner of the machine and carpenter shop purchased by the said Manuel Kosca with assets and liabilities and other rights and obligations of that special partnership; or whether, instead of the defendant Kosca, the later purchaser of the same business, Jose Infante, is the obligor, by virtue of a contract entered into between Kosca and Infante with the intervention of the original owners of the shop, it is first necessary to inquire whether this second sale made by Kosca to Infante, recorded in the instrument dated April 26, 1912, materially affects the previous contract executed on February 12, 1912, and ratified before a notary on the 15th of the same month, by the original owners of the shop and the defendant Manuel Kosca.<br\/><br\/>That instrument ratified before the notary Salas on February 15, 1912, shows that the defendant Kosca purchased and acquired the shop with the business conducted therein and all its assets and liabilities for the price of P9,073.72, payable at the rate of P168.50 per month from the subsequent March of that year to its owners, the vendor members of the partnership M. Kosca &amp; Co.;\u00a0 and by virtue of this contract the purchaser Kosca took over all the rights and obligations of the\u00a0 partnership, under the joint and several guaranty of the bondsman Sixto Mendoza.<br\/><br\/>Among the items that form the liabilities of the business acquired by the defendant Kosca, is the debt in cash to the plaintiff, Jose Vaca, of P2,729.87; deducting from this sum Pl,226.44, the aggregate of the amounts collected by the plaintiff or credited to the defendant, there remains the net sum of P1,571.73; adding to this the P414.48 advanced by the plaintiff to Tuason &amp; Sampedro, for lumber furnished by them on February 8th and 9th, 1912, to the partnership of M. Kosca &amp; Co., we have the total sum of P1,985,91, the amount which the defendant Kosca, who is liable for the debts of the said firm, owes Jose Vaca, and it is the amount claimed in this suit.<br\/><br\/>Defendant's contention that he is exempt from the obligation to pay the sum demanded and that the action for its collection should be brought against Jose Infante, the present possessor of the said shop, could be considered and admitted, if the contract contained in the instrument Exhibit 1 had been perfected and if it embodied the essential requisites of a valid and effective contract in such wise that it completely altered and invalidated the previous contract executed between the former owners of the said shop and Manuel Kosca, on February 12, 1912, for, were it so, it would be unquestionable that the defendant Kosca would have been entirely relieved of all liability and his obligations toward the original owners of the shop mentioned, including the plaintiff Jose Vaca; but it is fully proven by the record that the instrument Exhibit 1 does not express, as the defendant supposes, a perfect, valid and effective contract by virtue of which the defendant Kosca has been relieved from complying with the obligations contained in the previous contract of February 12, 1912; and, therefore, the action brought for the collection of the credit claimed by the plaintiff is sustainable and was properly instituted against the said Kosca.\u00a0 It could not have lain or been brought against Jose Infante, as he was not legally and effectively obligated by the proposed contract of April 26, 1912, unratified by its executors before the notary who drafted it.<br\/><br\/>In connection with the said instrument Exhibit 1, dated April 26,1912, the following considerations are quoted from the decision rendered by this court in case No. 8658 (Ruperto <i>vs<\/i>, Kosca, <i>ante<\/i>, p. 227), brought by the original owners of the said shop against Manuel Kosca and his bondsman for the collection of a sum of money:<br\/><blockquote>\"In order to decide the first point relative to whether the contract contained in the aforementioned instrument Exhibit 1 is valid and effective, an examination must be made to ascertain whether this contract became perfected between the contracting parties, since, pursuant to article 1278 of the Civil Code, contracts shall be binding, whatever may be the form in which they may have been executed, provided the essential conditions required for their validity exist.<br\/><br\/>\"It is a fact that the interested parties agreed to execute a contract for the purchase and sale, through the mediation of the plaintiffs, of a machine and carpenter shop belonging to Manuel Kosca, by virtue of which\u00a0 the purchaser, Jose Infante, should be subrogated in place of the vendor, Kosca, with respect to the rights and obligations contracted by the latter in accordance with the previous contract of sale executed between him and the plaintiffs on February 15, 1912; and, for this\u00a0 purpose, Kosca's substitute, Jose\u00a0 Infante, bound himself to present two bondsmen who would guarantee Infante's fulfillment, as Kosca's substitute, with respect to the obligations contracted by Kosca toward the plaintiffs; but, though it appears that the latter\u00a0 signed the said instrument, it constituted only a proposed agreement drawn up by the notary, until it should be ratified by the contracting parties, and it cannot be held that a proposed contract is binding, because it is not perfect and the essential conditions required for its validity do not exist.<br\/><br\/>\"It was signed by the contracting parties, and particularly by the plaintiffs, upon the condition that the principal obligor, Jose Infante, would comply with the conditions therein stipulated, among which was the furnishing of security by two bondsmen and because this requirement, stipulated in condition 5 of the said contract, was not complied with (for Infante was unable to furnish two bondsmen, as the two persons presented by him in the office of the notary would not sign the instrument, according to the latter's testimony), the plaintiffs, who intervened as creditors and parties principally interested in the contract of sale stipulated between the vendor Kosca, and the vendee Infante, refused to ratify the said contract before a notary.<br\/><br\/>\"Article 1114 of the Civil Code prescribes:\u00a0 'In conditional obligations, the acquisition of rights as well as the extinction or loss of those already acquired, shall depend upon the event constituting the condition.'<br\/><br\/>\"The condition imposed by the plaintiffs, creditors entitled to collect nearly the whole price of the sale of the said shop, was that the purchaser, Infante, should guarantee the fulfillment of the obligations for the execution of which he was to substitute Kosca in taking charge of the shop, and the plaintiffs' consent to the sale and transfer of the shop by Kosca to Infante was dependent on that condition.<br\/><br\/>\"Since the said condition was unfulfilled, to wit, that two bondsmen should guarantee the liability that would be contracted by Jose Infante, it is unquestionable that the plaintiffs cannot be obliged to consent to the stipulations covenanted between Kosca and Infante and that the instrument Exhibit 1 contains only a projected contract, one not perfected because of the lack of consent on the part of the plaintiffs, which is a requisite prescribed in article 1261 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>\"On this hypothesis, that the contract of purchase\u00a0 and sale projected in the instrument Exhibit 1, did not rest upon the express consent of the plaintiffs, it is evident that this instrument has not produced the effect of annulling or invalidating the previous contract of February 15, 1912, executed by Manuel Kosca in favor of the plaintiffs, and that, if this first contract subsists and is maintained and neither Kosca nor his bondsmen, Sixto Mendoza, has been substituted by Jose Infante, nor by the latter relieved from the fulfillment of the obligations established in the said previous contract, then Manuel Kosca is still bound to comply with the obligations and liabilities\u00a0 he assumed toward the plaintiffs under the guarantee given jointly and severally by him and\u00a0 his bondsman, Sixto Mendoza.\"<\/blockquote>The prior contract of February 12, 1912, ratified before the notary Salas, undoubtedly subsists, and for this reason the defendant Kosca is liable for the debts and all the obligations contracted by the partnership known as M. Kosca &amp; Co. and assumed by him, according to the said contract; and if the sum claimed by Jose Vaca forms a part of the liabilities of that partnership, for which the defendant Kosca became liable, together with all its assets and rights, it is undeniable that he is directly and effectively bound to pay the sum claimed, since he was unable to deny or refute the certainty and lawfulness of the said debt, for his whole defense consists merely in the averment that the plaintiff, Jose Vaca, as one of the partners and owners of the shop and its business, had consented to and approved the assignment and sale made by him to Jose Infante who, according to the aforementioned contract of April 25th, took charge of the business\u00a0 and assumed the obligation to pay the defendant's debts,\u00a0 as shown by the instrument of April 25, signed by all the interested parties, including the plaintiff Jose Vaca.<br\/><br\/>In the considerations quoted, which among others served as grounds for the decision rendered in the said case No. 8658, it was fully and extensively demonstrated that the projected contract contained in the instrument Exhibit 1 did not become perfected, for the reason that Jose Infante did not fulfill the condition of presenting two bondsmen who would guarantee the said contract, wherefore the original owners of the said shop, one of whom was the plaintiff Jose Vaca, did not give their consent to the price of the sale of the same, and for this reason the contract of purchase and sale stipulated between Manuel Kosca and Jose Infante was not perfected and, as a mere project, could not produce the effect of annulling and invalidating the prior contract of February 15, 1912, executed by the said Kosca in favor of the vendors of the shop, one of whom was the plaintiff Jose Vaca, In consequence thereof, Kosca was not substituted by Jose Infante, nor relieved by the latter from complying with the obligations and liabilities he had assumed toward all the creditors of the partnership of M. Kosca &amp; Co., and it is neither just nor reasonable that Jose Infante be considered as subrogated in place of Kosca and held responsible for the obligations and liabilities that the said Infante did not assume, even with respect to the previous owners of the shop sold.<br\/><br\/>In the inventory of the assets and liabilities of the said partnership, inserted in the instrument Exhibit F, there appears as the first item of the liabilities the partnership's debt to Jose Vaca, amounting to P2,797.87.\u00a0 In paragraph 4 of the same document it is said that \"by virtue of this contract Manuel Kosca assumes all the obligations of the special partnership, M. Kosca &amp; Co., in conformity\u00a0 with the liabilities,\" and in paragraph 5 that \"it is also covenanted that, by virtue of this purchase, whatever other rights and whatever other obligations the special partnership M. Kosca &amp; Co. may have or may have had since the day of its organization are hereby transferred to the said Manuel Kosca,\" and that \"the cost of this instrument and of the others\u00a0 hereto annexed shall be borne by the said Manuel Kosca.\"<br\/><br\/>After the deduction of various sums which the defendant, Manuel Kosca, now as owner of the shop, paid to the plaintiff, Jose Vaca, and of other amounts which Vaca credited to Kosca in the latter's same capacity, the debt recorded in the aforesaid instrument was reduced to P1,571.43; but by failure to pay the account, Exhibit B, for P414.48, the price of the lumber bought on credit by the said partnership from Tuason &amp; Sampedro on the 8th and 9th of February, 1912, dates prior to the purchase and acquisition of the said shop by Kosca, according to the instrument of February 12, 1912, which lumber was delivered to the partnership under the guaranty of Jose Vaca, the latter had to pay for this lumber, and it is just that the plaintiff recover the amount so paid by him from the present owner of the shop, who is the defendant Manuel Kosca, since this latter assumed all the obligations and liabilities against the shop acquired by him, according to the express agreement made with its previous owners.<br\/><br\/>It seems strange that the defendant should have had in his possession and\" made use of the projected contract, although it was neither perfected, nor, for lack of bondsmen, ratified before the notary who drafted it.\u00a0 The notary explained this irregularity by saying that he furnished this document to the defendant under promise to return it, which he did not do.<br\/><br\/>The instrument Exhibit 1 was drawn up on April 26, 1912, for the purpose of effecting the renewal by novation of the previous contract of February 12 of the same year by modifying it so as to substitute the debtor and bondsmen and by subrogating Jose Infante in place of the defendant Manuel Kosca, with the express consent of the creditors, Infante binding himself to comply with the obligations and liabilities of the defendant Kosca, in accordance with the provisions of articles 1203 and 1205 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>Pursuant to the agreement, Jose Infante, the purchaser and substitute debtor, who was subrogated in place of the defendant in order to comply with the obligations contracted by the latter toward the previous owners of the shop, as set forth in the previous contract of February 12, 1912, was to present two bondsmen who should guarantee the fulfillment of the contract; this he was unable to do, notwithstanding his efforts; wherefore one of the principal conditions of the contract remained unfulfilled and without this, as is to be supposed, the previous owners of the said shop and creditors for its price never would have consented to the agreement, as they did not ratify the contents of the aforesaid instrument Exhibit 1, on account of such\u00a0 lack of guaranty, as they did not consider this docurfient perfected and definitely completed, and it could not, therefore, produce the effects of a valid and effective instrument in favor of the defendant Kosca and against Jose Infante, or affect the rights of the defendant's creditors.<br\/><br\/>The credit, the payment of which is demanded by the plaintiff, appears as one of the debits among the liabilities recorded in the instrument, Exhibit F, of the date of February 12, 1912, which the purchaser of the shop, Manuel Kosca, obligated himself to pay, and therefore the plaintiffcreditor, Jose Vaca, was not obligated to give notice of his acceptance to Manuel Kosca, the debtor, who assumed the obligations and liabilities contracted by the previous owners of the shop, and such notice was not required in order to enable Vaca to exercise his right, as creditor, to collect his credit with entire independence of the right of the previous owners of the said shop in the price of the sale thereof.<br\/><br\/>So then, this suit involves the unquestionable right of Jose Vaca, as creditor, to collect his credit from the defendant, Manuel Kosca, the party obligated to pay the debts of the previous owners\u00a0 of the said shop, pursuant to the obligation contracted in the instrument, Exhibit F, of February 12, 1912, duly ratified before a notary.\u00a0 The plaintiff is also entitled to collect, as an indemnity, legal interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the date of his complaint.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion that, with reversal of the judgment appealed from, we should sentence the defendant Manuel Kosca, as we do hereby, to pay\u00a0 the sum of P1,985.91, with legal interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the date of the complaint, May 28, 1912; and no special finding is made as to the costs of both instances.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Esteban Y. Vasquez, before the Court of First Instance of lloilo, the said accused did willfully, unlawfully and\u00a0 criminally\u00a0 declare, swear\u00a0 and affirm to the court that Juan Abraham, jr., had signed and issued a receipt for the sum of P8,700, on account of the debt of the said accused, said declaration being entirely false, as the accused well knew, and material for decision of said civil case; in violation of law.\"<br\/><br\/>The crime of perjury charged in the information is alleged to have been committed during the trial of civil case No. 1692 in the Court of First Instance of lloilo, wherein Juan Abraham, jr., sued the defendant Vazquez for some nine thousand and odd pesos, alleged to be a balance due on account.\u00a0 During the trial of the civil case the defendant produced an alleged receipt for P8,700 which he alleged had been signed and delivered to him by Juan Abraham, jr., on July 9, 1911, on which date he swore that he had paid Juan Abraham this amount of money on account.<br\/><br\/>If in fact the receipt offered in evidence in the civil case was not genuine, as claimed by Abraham, and if the defendant had not paid the P8,700 as he claimed, then his testimony given in the former case was false and being material to the issues in that case he was undoubtedly guilty of perjury.<br\/><br\/>The record shows that during the period covered by the account Abraham made advances of money and merchandise to Vazquez who was a farmer, at that time operating a large hacienda in Occidental Negros, and that Vazquez made deliveries of sugar and other farm products to Abraham, to be disposed of by the latter on commission.\u00a0 At the time the civil action was instituted Abraham claimed a balance on account in his favor of something more than P9,000.\u00a0 A transcript of the testimony which was taken in the civil case and made a part of the record in this case, discloses that Vazquez swore that on the date of the receipt he had paid the sum of P8,700, whereupon Abraham had executed the receipt offered in evidence; and the fact that the accused so testified in the former case was also affirmatively established by the testimony of Jose Arroyo, who was Abraham's attorney in the civil case, and by the testimony of Vazquez testifying in his own behalf in the case at bar.\u00a0 Abraham denied that he had received the P8,700 from Vazquez or from any person acting for Vazquez or that he had signed and delivered the receipt in question.\u00a0 The alleged receipt reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>He recibido del Sr. Esteban Y. Vazquez la cantidad de OCHO MIL SETECIENTOS PESOS FILIPINOS (P8,700) endosado a C\/.<br\/><br\/>Iloilo, 9 Julio, 1911.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">J. ABRAHAM, Jr.<\/div><\/blockquote>The body of the alleged receipt is typewritten on a small piece of ruled ledger paper with marginal perpendicular lines for figures.\u00a0 The evidence discloses that Abraham was accustomed to make invoices of his shipments of goods from time to time to Vazquez in Occidental Negros; that these invoices were usually made on ledger paper, such as\u00a0 that on which the alleged receipt appears; that it was his practice to have copies of these invoices made in his letter-press book; and that among other invoices so made, as shown by the letter-press book, was one made out in the following terms:<br\/><blockquote>Factura de los efectos embarcados en la \"La Viana\" pa al Esteban Vazquez.<br\/><br\/><table border=\"0\" width=\"100%\"> <tbody><tr valign=\"top\"> <td width=\"85%\">Por 32.27 piculs arroz 2.a Calumpit a f=6.15 pp en 19.1\/2 sf.........................................................<\/td> <td width=\"15%\"><div align=\"right\">P198.46<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>Embarque......................................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">1.45<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td>\u00a0<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">_______<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <tr valign=\"top\"> <td height=\"21\">Al Debito de su cta.........................................<\/td> <td><div align=\"right\">199.91<\/div><\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody><\/table><br\/>S. E. u O.<br\/>Iloilo, 15 Nov., 1910.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">J. ABRAHAM, Jr.<\/div><\/blockquote>The theory of the prosecution, and the conclusion reached by the trial judge is that Vazquez erased all the writing on this invoice except the signature, and inserted the body of the alleged receipt in typewriting over the genuine signature as it originally appeared on the invoice.<br\/><br\/>The original receipts and letter-press copy of the invoice were not made a part of the record in this case as they were filed as exhibits in the civil case which is now pending on appeal, but photographic copies of the originals were filed as exhibits with this record, and the court below observed that these photographic copies bring out many of the details even better than the originals.<br\/><br\/>The record shows that during the progress of the trial the tissue sheet of the letter-press book on which the copy of the invoice appeared was superimposed on the alleged receipt and that the signature of \"J. Abraham, jr.,\" on the alleged receipt was an exact facsimile of the signature on the letter-press copy of the invoice, a fact which is readily apparent from an examination of the photographic copies attached as exhibits to the record before us.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, superimposing the letter-press copy of the invoice upon the alleged receipt certain words and figures faintly outlined on the alleged receipt correspond exactly in appearance and in relative position with the same words or figures as found on the letter-press copy of the invoice.\u00a0 These outlines are not plainly visible at first sight, but they are readily discovered upon a detailed examination of the document.\u00a0 A dim yet distinct outline of the first six letters of the word \"embarque\" appears on the alleged receipt at exactly the same point by relation to the signature at which that word is found on the letter-press copy of the invoice, and in like manner the figures and letters \"19.\u00bd sf\" and the capital letter O from the Spanish abbreviation \"S. E. u O.\" as they appear on the letter-press copy of the invoice are distinctly outlined in the alleged receipt.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge in his opinion observed that the alleged receipt appears to have been macerated in such a way as to indicate that erasures had been made upon it, and he was of opinion that the signature to the alleged receipt had that dull and colorless appearance which would naturally result from its passage through a copy-press book.<br\/><br\/>We are of opinion that the evidence conclusively establishes the contentions of the prosecution that this alleged receipt is a forgery, and that the amount of the payment which it purports to evidence was not paid by the defendant as claimed by him in his testimony in the former case.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for appellant contends that under the provisions of section 3 of Act No. 1697 a conviction of the crime of perjury as there defined cannot be sustained unless the record establishes that:\u00a0 First, the defendant took an oath before a competent tribunal, officer or person; second, that the oath\u00a0 was that he would testify truly; and third, that the alleged false testimony was material to the issue of the case wherein it was given.\u00a0 And counsel insists that even granting that the evidence sustains a finding that the alleged receipt was a forgery, nevertheless the judgment of conviction cannot be sustained in this case because, as counsel contends, the prosecution failed to establish the three essential facts above set forth.<br\/><br\/>It is urged that the transcript of the testimony taken in the civil case\u00a0 was improperly admitted over the objection of the plaintiff's attorney.\u00a0 The only objections offered by counsel below to the admission of this transcript was that the facts established by it had already been established by oral proof, and that its introduction was therefore unnecessary.\u00a0 The objection now urged against its admission is that the\u00a0 transcript does not appear to be sufficiently authenticated as a true copy.\u00a0 It appears however that the clerk of the court testified that the signature of the stenographer attached to the transcript was the genuine signature of the court stenographer who acted in that case.\u00a0 The civil case having been tried in the same court wherein the criminal proceedings were had, we think there can be no doubt that in the absence of proof of its inaccuracy this evidence constituted a sufficient authentication of the transcript as a true copy of the record of the testimony taken in the former case.\u00a0 This transcript affirmatively discloses that at the trial of a civil case before the Honorable\u00a0 J. S. Powell, judge of the Court of First Instance\u00a0 of Iloilo, \"Mr. Esteban Y. Vazquez being duly sworn, states, etc.\"\u00a0 We are of opinion and so hold that the transcript of the record, whereby it is shown that the defendant was duly sworn, sufficiently meets the requirements of the law.<br\/><blockquote>\" 'Duly sworn' means a swearing according to law, hence where a record shows that the jury were duly sworn, it must be held to be a swearing according to the form of the statute.\"\u00a0 (Wilson <i>vs<\/i>. Pugh, 32 Miss., 196.)<\/blockquote>But independently of the transcript of the testimony taken in the civil case, we are of opinion as we have already indicated, that the oral testimony introduced at the trial in the criminal case sufficiently establishes the fact that the accused falsely testified in violation of the provisions of section 3 of Act No. 1697 to a material fact after having taken an oath before a competent tribunal that he would testify truly.<br\/><br\/>Jose Arroyo testified that he was present when the defendant testified at the civil case, and that the defendant testified under \"oath.\"\u00a0 The record showing as it does in this case that the defendant testified under oath in the former case, the legal presumption in the absence of proof to the contrary is that he was duly sworn and that he took an oath to testify truly before a competent tribunal.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

I., and within the jurisdiction of this court, the said accused, conspiring together and combining among themselves, did willfully, unlawfully, criminally and fraudulently, and knowingly, import and introduce into the Philippine Islands from a foreign country, and did aid in the importation\u00a0 and introduction into the Philippine Islands from a foreign country, in violation of law, goods, articles, and merchandise, to wit: 976 grams of morphine, which is a derivative of opium, having a value of P100 Philippine currency; and at said time and place the said accused, conspiring together and combining among themselves, did receive, conceal, and aid in transporting, receiving and concealing the said quantity of morphine, after it\u00a0 had been imported, knowing that said drug had been illegally imported into the Philippine Islands from a foreign country.\" <\/blockquote>The evidence discloses that on the 21st day of November, 1912, one\u00a0 Andrews, supercargo of the steamer <i>Siberia<\/i>, which was at that time lying in Manila Bay, was arrested by a customs secret service agent while in the act of bringing two sacks of morphine on shore; that Andrews informed the customs authorities that the morphine had been turned over to him by a Chinaman on board the steamer <i>Siberia<\/i> to be delivered to another Chinaman whose name he did not know but who would be found in house No. 389 Calle Anloague; that therupon Larsen, a customs secret service agent, went with Andrews to the house designated by him; that on entering this house they found Lim Tiong Tim seated at a table; that after saluting the accused, Andrews told him that he came from the steamship <i>Siberia<\/i>; that on hearing this the accused spoke in Chinese to some other Chinamen who were in the room at the time, and who left immediately; that the accused asked Andrews and Larsen if they had brought those things with them; that they replied that they had, and\u00a0 handed him the two sacks of morphine which Andrews had brought on shore from the <i>Siberia<\/i>; that the accused took the sacks and after feeling them asked if there were not more than two; that upon being told that those were all, he threw the sacks under the table; that having been requested to give a receipt, he called another Chinaman, Hao You Kee (one of the codefendants in the trial had in the court below) and that at his direction this Chinaman wrote a receipt, which was made a part of the record and marked Exhibit B; that when this receipt was completed, Larsen informed the accused and Hao You Kee that they were under arrest; that the accused then attempted to run away, but was captured and made a prisoner; that in due course they, together with another Chinaman named Ah Tung, were held for trial on the charge set forth in the information set out above.<br\/><br\/>Upon proof of these facts the trial court convicted the defendant Lim Tiong Tim and acquitted the defendants Ah Tung and Hao You Kee.\u00a0 It appears that Andrews was tried separately, pleaded guilty to the illegal importation of the drug, and was convicted and sentenced therefor.<br\/><br\/>The accused insists that he knew nothing whatever about the morphine in question or its alleged illegal importation; that the house in which he was arrested did not belong to him; and that the secret-service agent Larsen forced Hao You Kee to write the receipt at the point of a revolver.\u00a0 We are of opinion, however, that the weight of the evidence sustains the story told by the witnesses for the prosecution and the findings of fact by the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses testify, and that these findings\u00a0 sufficiently establish the guilt of the appellant of the offense with which he was charged.\u00a0 We think that the evidence conclusively establishes that the two sacks of morphine were sent from on board the <i>Siberia<\/i> to the accused; that he was expecting them under some arrangement previously had with the sender; and that when he received them and ordered the preparation of the receipt he knew the nature of their contents.\u00a0 We are convinced that while it may be and doubtless is true that the secret service agent drew a pistol at the time of making the arrest, the accused directed the preparation of the receipt voluntarily and in the ordinary course of the transaction, and we are satisfied that it was not until after the receipt had been prepared or was in course of preparation that the revolver was drawn and the accused placed under arrest.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for appellant makes four assignments of error, as follows:\u00a0 \"(1) The court erred in allowing the alleged statements of Andrews to be admitted against the defendant Lim Tiong Tim not made in the presence of said defendant, and in the admission of the receipt; (2) the court erred in its decision in its probative finding of fact relating to the actions and conviction of Andrews, it not being shown that the defendant Lim Tiong Tim knew Andrews or ever had any connection with him prior to his arrest; (3) the court erred in its finding that the defendant Lim Tiong Tim received the morphine, knowing that it was contraband morphine, or in accordance with an arrangement made previously with the smugglers on board the ship; (4) the court erred in allowing the defendant Lim Tiong Tim to be cross-examined in reference to another criminal case in which he had been convicted, and in allowing the introduction in evidence of the sentence in that case after the defendant had admitted his prior conviction.\"<br\/><br\/>In regard to the first assignment of error it is sufficient to say that the statements made by Andrews as to the circumstances under which, he had received the two sacks of morphine and his commission to carry them to the house on Calle Anloague do not appear to have been admitted in evidence as declarations of one of several conspirators binding: on his coconspirator, but rather by way of explanation of the proceedings adopted by the customs secret service agent in going to that house and there turning over the morphine to the accused.\u00a0 Its value as evidence against the accused is derived solely from the natural and necessary inferences to be drawn from the conduct of the accused, when examined in the light of the evidence showing the circumstances under which Andrews and the secret-service agent called at the house where they found him and turned over to him the contraband drug.\u00a0 As to the receipt prepared by Hao You Kee, We think that the evidence sufficiently discloses that it was prepared at the order of the appellant and that it was prepared voluntarily in the ordinary course of the transaction, and was not executed at the point of a revolver as alleged by appellant.<br\/><br\/>What has already been said sufficiently disposes of the second and third assignments of error.<br\/><br\/>The fourth assignment of error seems to have for its basis the contention of counsel that proof of a previous conviction should not be admitted until after judgment of conviction of the offense for which the accused is being tried has been rendered, a rule of practice which has been adopted in some States of the Union by statute and in others by the courts in all cases where the question of the guilt or innocence of an accused person is tried by a jury.\u00a0 The basis of the rule is the fear that the introduction of evidence of a former conviction may have a tendency to prejudice the jury against the accused, and to make them think that his prior character is bad.\u00a0 But in the absence of\u00a0 a statute providing a contrary rule the practice in the United States is by no means uniform and \"usually the State is permitted to put in the record of the prior conviction as a part of its case before the verdict is reached on the substantive crime.\"\u00a0 (Underhill on Criminal Evidence, par. 512, note 20, and cases there cited.)<br\/><br\/>In New York it has been held that as a prior conviction is a fact of criminality which the State must prove, the admission of a prior conviction by counsel for the accused does not preclude the State from proving it, particularly where the admission does not concede the prior conviction as alleged in the indictment, and is made after the State has begun its case.\u00a0 (People <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> Jordan, 125 App. Div. (N. Y.) 522; 109 N. Y. S., 840.)\u00a0 In People <i>vs<\/i>. Sickles (156 N. Y., 541; 51 N. E., 288), it was held that\u00a0 \"the rule is the same as to the right of the State to prove a prior conviction, even when it was conceded before the jury was impaneled.\"<br\/><br\/>We are of opinion that the rule contended for by counsel for appellant has no proper place in the practice in this jurisdiction where the question of the guilt of the accused is determined by the trial judge without the aid of a jury.\u00a0 As a rule it is more convenient and practicable for all parties concerned that such evidence be introduced during the trial, and the fear\u00a0 that its introduction may prejudice the judge against the accused is hardly sufficient to justify us in laying down a different practice.\u00a0 While the knowledge that the prosecution intends to submit evidence as to a former conviction may readily be kept from a jury until it has returned its verdict, it would be impossible to keep such knowledge from the judge who presides at the trial.\u00a0 If a trial judge were weak enough to be unduly influenced by evidence of a former conviction he would doubtless be influenced in like manner by knowledge that the prosecution intends to submit evidence as to a former conviction, and in that event it might be of the utmost importance to the accused that he should have an opportunity to remove any such prejudice in the mind of the judge by the introduction of evidence refuting the charge as to a former conviction.<br\/><br\/>We conclude that in this jurisdiction, where all trials in criminal cases are had without the aid of a jury, the evidence as to a former conviction is properly introduced at the trial of the subsequent charge, and that the trial judge must be relied upon to hear all the evidence without being swayed by prejudices, which might readily affect a body of jurors less experienced and skilled in the administration of justice than he must be presumed to be.<br\/><br\/>Of course, in such cases, the best evidence of a prior conviction is a certified copy of the original judgment of conviction, and such evidence is always admissible and conclusive unless the accused himself denies his identity with the person convicted at the former trial.\u00a0 As to the alleged irregularities in the cross-examination of the accused when on the witness stand, it is sufficient to say that at most they constituted error without prejudice.<br\/><br\/>We are of opinion and so hold, that the guilt of this defendant and appellant of the crime\u00a0 with which he was charged was conclusively established in the court below, and we find no error in the proceedings prejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused.\u00a0 The judgment convicting and sentencing him, modified by the addition thereto of six months' imprisonment (in accordance with our practice, the grounds for which are laid down in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Tan Yak, 25 Phil. Rep., 116), should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><br\/>MORELAND, J., concurring in\u00a0 part:<br\/><br\/>I agree to the conviction but not the change of penalty.<br\/><br\/>The principle underlying the change of penalty abrogates the law relating to discretional penalties, deprives the trial court of some of its most important functions, and reduces it to a mere puppet moved, in the administration of the law, not by its own judgment but by the substituted judgment of this court. <\/div>",

As security for this sum I pledge my property, both present and future, which shall be subject to attachment in case I am unable to pay what we have stipulated in this instrument.\u2014In witness whereof I sign this instrument, together with the witnesses here present.\u2014Date <i>ut supra<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"[SEAL.] <br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">(Sgd.)\u00a0 \"TELESFORO ULIBARE.<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"Signed in the presence of:<br\/><br\/>(Sgd.)\u00a0 \"E.

Vidal, Calixto Quiachon, and Donato Arbis.<br\/><br\/>The defendant admitted that the signature appearing at the bottom of said instrument was his, but denied having contracted the debt set forth therein in favor of the plaintiff, Vicente Villagracia, and to explain why he had signed it, stated that he had affixed his signature on the blank third page of a folded sheet of paper, on the first leaf and two pages whereof was made out a lease of certain land belonging to Calixto Quiachon and his wife, executed by Eleuterio Ursos; and that he did so when Quiachon presented the said document to him in his house and had him sign it as one of the owners of the adjoining lands.\u00a0 The defendant added that he wrote his signature on the upper part of the second leaf, inner side, of the sheet of paper, for the reason that the two pages or sides of the first leaf of the sheet were already covered with writing, and that he signed the document in his house about noon one day in the month of May, 1909, in the presence of two witnesses, named Onofre Undajare and Leona Villagracia, who corroborated these statements and testified that they were informed of the contents of the document by Calixto Quiachon, and by the defendant, who read it aloud before he signed it.\u00a0 Calixto Quiachon denied having obtained the signature of the defendant to an instrument of lease, in the latter's house, hut asserted that Eleuterio Ursos had leased from him a piece of land, though the lessee executed no instrument whatever therefor.<br\/><br\/>The evidence adduced by the plaintiff, Vicente Villagracia, tended to prove that, on the afternoon of July 10, 1909, the defendant signed the instrument, Exhibit A, in the presence of the said three witnesses whose names appear at the foot thereof, which instrument, it is alleged, was drawn up and written by Eutiquio Vidal in accordance with conditions stipulated between the plaintiff and the defendant.<br\/><br\/>The honorable judge of the lower court, after analysis and careful study of the evidence introduced at trial by both parties, reached the following conclusions in his judgment:<br\/><blockquote>\"A close and detailed examination of the signatures affixed to Exhibit A, and of the paper on which the said promissory note was written, reveals the following irregularities:<br\/><br\/>\"1. At first sight it is observed that the ink used in writing the signature of Telesforo Ulibare is of a different color from that employed in writing, not only the rest of the document, but also the signatures of E. Vidal and Calixto Quiachon.<br\/><br\/>\"2. The signature of Donato Arbis appears also to have been written with different ink from that of the signatures of E. Vidal and Calixto Quiachon.<br\/><br\/>\"3. The paper on which the instrument was written has been cut on its right edge with scissors, to such an extent that some of the words written near this edge have also been cut.<br\/><br\/>\"If it is true that Ulibare, Quiachon, and Arbis did sign the instrument at the same time, each in the other's presence, with the same ink and with the same pen, I find no explanation to account for the difference in the ink, as observed by comparing Ulibare's signature with those of E. Vidal and Quiachon.\u00a0 Ulibare's signature must have been written with other ink, and therefore the testimony given by the plaintiff's- witnesses is false, to wit, that Ulibare signed the instrument, Exhibit A, together with them and at the same time that they did, in Villagracia's house.<br\/><br\/>\"Upon examining the edges of the paper on which the instrument is written, it is discovered that the left edge of its first page must have been the outside edge of the front of a sheet of rough-edged paper, and that the right edge has been cut with scissors.\u00a0 It is, therefore, evident that the writing was commenced on the fourth or the second page of a sheet of Catalan paper, and that the reason for cutting the right edge was to make believe that this edge was the outside one, for, had it not been cut, it would have appeared rough and uneven like the inside edge of a leaf of paper made by tearing the sheet into halves.\u00a0 There was a purpose in the cutting, for the usual and natural way is to begin a document on the first page of a sheet of paper, in which case, upon dividing the sheet into two, the irregular inner edge would be on the left side, but, on the document in question, the left side is really the even outer edge.<br\/><br\/>\"As the writing of the document was begun on the fourth or the second page of a sheet of Catalan paper divided into halves, the defendant's assertion that he signed on the third page, which was blank, is reasonably credible and finds its most complete corroboration in the fact that the ink with which his name is written is different from that used in writing the rest of the instrument.<br\/><br\/>\"In view of these circumstances, the court has not the least doubt that the said instrument is in all respects false and fraudulent. Telesforo Ulibare took no part whatsoever in its execution, nor was he present when it was written.\u00a0 The witnesses Vidal, Quiachon, and Arbis did not see Telesforo \"Ulibare sign this instrument which was fabricated for the purpose of injuring Ulibare, who, as was proved at the trial, had had some disagreement with and grudge against Vicente Villagracia because the latter had requested Ulibare's vote in the election for municipal president, held in Iwisan, and yet Ulibare had refused to vote for him.\u00a0 The plaintiff and his witnesses scandalously perverted the truth, notwithstanding their oath, by testifying that Telesforo Ulibare signed this instrument in their presence, and it is unquestionable that they took advantage of the circumstance that Telesforo Ulibare had affixed his signature to an instrument held by Calixto Quiachon, which signature Ulibare had written on a blank page, and that they merely tore off the half-sheet which bore Ulibare's signature, turned it over and commenced writing on the back, and afterwards cut one of the edges of the paper for the purpose of falsely giving it the appearance of being the original outer edge.<br\/><br\/>\"The plaintiff's claim is, therefore, founded on an instrument which is entirely false, and consequently cannot be cause or ground to produce any obligation in favor of Vicente Villagracia for any sum whatever, since the defendant contracted no lawful or true obligation of any kind toward the said Villagracia.\"<\/blockquote>Furthermore, upon examining the instrument Exhibit A, by holding it to the light, there can be plainly seen the half of a watermark stamped by the factory whence came the paper on which the instrument was written.\u00a0 This half of the watermark is visible on the right edge of the paper, looking at the front or face of the sheet as regards the writing, and on the left edge, as seen from the reverse side.\u00a0 The position of this watermark virtually corroborates the theory advanced by the defendant in his defense, to wit, that he affixed his signature, after a few lines, to the upper part of the inner face of the second leaf of the sheet or document which had been presented to him in his house by Quiachon to sign, since the manufacturer's watermark is customarily stamped in the center of the sheet in such wise that it marks both leaves thereof, and the mere fact of the half of this watermark appearing on the right edge or side of the instrument, Exhibit A, viewed from the front where the writing begins, proves that after separating and cutting the said leaf, containing the defendant's signature on its inner face, from the other to which it was united, he who afterwards wrote the instrument commenced the writing on the outer side of the separated leaf and finished it on the inner side thereof, above the defendant's signature which had been written on this inner side of the leaf when the same was blank, and so, in order to conceal the edge of separation of the instrument, Exhibit A, from the first leaf of the sheet, the very side where the said watermark is visible was cut with scissors, one-half of which mark remained with the other leaf from which the leaf containing the instrument Exhibit A was cut and separated.<br\/><br\/>These considerations and those set forth by the trial court in his judgment tend to demonstrate in a decisive and conclusive manner, that the defendant, Ulibare, is not under obligation to comply with the engagement contained in the instrument Exhibit A, inasmuch as it was not duly proved that the contract from which proceeds the obligation therein stipulated, was executed, for, according to article 1261 of the Civil Code, there is no contract unless the following requisites, among others, exist:\u00a0 The consent of the contracting parties, and the consideration of the obligation established thereby.\u00a0 The record does not show that the defendant consented to contract the engagement contained in the instrument Exhibit A, nor does the latter show the cause or consideration for which the defendant, as alleged, bound himself to deliver at the end of November, 1909, 200 cavans of rice or to pay the price thereof, amounting to P300, at the rate of P1.50 per cavan.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, the errors assigned to the judgment appealed from have been refuted and the said judgment should be, as it is hereby, affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Ilocos Sur to recover the possession of a parcel of land located in the settlement of Daligan (Danguisen), within the municipality of Cabugao, Province of Ilocos Sur, which parcel of land is particularly described in paragraph 2 of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>To the complaint the defendant presented a demurrer which was overruled by the lower court.\u00a0 Upon the overruling of the demurrer, the defendant filed an answer, admitting a part of the facts set out in the complaint and denying a part.\u00a0 To the answer, the plaintiff presented a demurrer, which was overruled by the lower court, on the 11th day of January, 1908.\u00a0 The cause seems to have been set down for trial on the 14th of January, 1908, at 8 o'clock a. m.\u00a0 On the 14th of January the cause was duly brought to trial.\u00a0 The defendant did not appear.\u00a0 By reason of the nonappearance of the defendant, the lower court rendered a judgment by default against him.<br\/><br\/>On the 15th of January, 1908, the Honorable Dionisio Chanco, judge, after having heard the evidence of the plaintiff, rendered a decision and judgment, in which he granted the prayer of the plaintiff, giving the lands in question to the plaintiff in accordance with said prayer.<br\/><br\/>On the 15th of January, 1908, and before said decision had been rendered, the defendant presented a motion asking that the judgment by default rendered against him be set aside and that he be granted a new trial, in accordance with the provisions of section 113 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions.\u00a0 The defendant, in his said motion, tries to make it appear that he had not had proper notice of the time fixed for the trial of said cause.\u00a0 In his said motion, however, he admits that he had an agreement with the attorney for the plaintiff to have the trial transferred from 8 o'clock a. m. of the 14th of January to 3 o'clock p. m. of the same day.\u00a0 This allegation is supported by an affidavit.\u00a0 At the same time the attorney for the plaintiff, by affidavit, denies that any such agreement had been entered into.\u00a0 The defendant admits that he appeared in court at 3 o'clock p. m. on the 14th of January, and found that the case had already been tried on the morning of that day.\u00a0 The appellant presents an affidavit from the clerk of the court, which shows that the defendant had been duly notified on the 11th of January, 1908, that said cause had been set down for trial at 8 o'clock a. m. on the 14th of January, 1908.\u00a0 The lower court denied the motion of the defendant and rendered a judgment as above indicated.\u00a0 To the ruling of the court denying the motion to set aside the judgment by default and to grant a new trial, as well as a final judgment, the defendant duly excepted and appealed to this court.<br\/><br\/>In this court the appellant prays that the judgment by default rendered against him be set aside, and that he be granted a new trial and that the judgment of the lower court be reversed.\u00a0 In support of his contention he presents no additional reason to that presented in the court below.\u00a0 The proof shows that he had been duly notified of the time and place of the trial.\u00a0 His only excuse for not appearing at that time is the fact that he claims that he had an agreement with the attorney for the plaintiff to have the trial transferred from 8 o'clock a. m. to 3 o'clock p. m. of the 14th of January, 1908.\u00a0 He undertakes to prove said agreement by an affidavit.\u00a0 The attorney for the plaintiff admits that the defendant requested hfis consent to have the trial transferred from 8 o'clock a. m. to 3 o'clock p. m., but that he refused to consent to the request.\u00a0 The lower court evidently believed the facts stated in the affidavit of the plaintiff that no agreement was entered into by him with the defendant to have the case transferred as is claimed\u00a0 by the defendant.\u00a0 Upon the question as to whether an agreement was made we have an affidavit presented by the defendant, alleging that it was, and an affidavit presented by the attorney for the plaintiff, in which he contends that no such agreement was made.\u00a0 The defendant and appellant does not attempt to show that even though a new trial should be granted him, he has proof sufficient to overcome the proof adduced by the plaintiff during the trial of the cause.\u00a0 The proof adduced during the trial of the cause, standing alone, seems to show, beyond question, that the plaintiff is entitled to the possession of the land, in accordance with and under the provisions of the prayer of his petition.\u00a0 Inasmuch as the lower court evidently believed that no such agreement, as the defendant contends was made, was entered into, and inasmuch as the defendant and appellant makes no effort to show that even though a new trial be granted, he has proof sufficient to overcome the proof adduced by the appellant, we are of the opinion that the judgment by default rendered by the lower court should not be revoked.\u00a0 Upon the question of fact the evidence adduced\u00a0 during the trial of the cause clearly shows that the plaintiff was entitled to the remedy prayed for.\u00a0 The judgment of the lower court is therefore hereby affirmed, and, without any finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

That he subscribes to the allegations contained in Paragraphs VII and VIII of the answer of his codefendants, for he believes them to be true according to trustworthy reports he possesses.\"<\/blockquote>Upon the issues thus formed, proof was presented by both parties.<br\/><br\/>From a reading of the evidence adduced, it is made clear that the question presented is whether or not the petitioner resigned as a member of the board of directors of the respondent bank on the 26th of September, 1912.\u00a0 If the petitioner did, in fact, resign as a member of said board, then the respondents had a right to deny to him the rights and privileges which he demanded.\u00a0 If, on the other hand, he did not resign, then the respondents have illegally denied\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and deprived him of the rights and privileges to which he was legally entitled as a member of said board, and he has, therefore, a right to the extraordinary remedy of mandamus to be restored to his legal rights as a member of said board.<br\/><br\/>The petitioner obtained his right to act as a member of the board of directors of said bank from the stockholders thereof, at their annual meeting.\u00a0 There is nothing in the record which would justify said board of directors in depriving the petitioner of the rights and privileges belonging or pertaining to the membership of such board, unless and until he should have voluntarily relinquished such rights and privileges, or until his tenure of office should have expired.\u00a0 We have then the question squarely presented\u2014Did the petitioner resign as is claimed by the respondents? Did the petitioner voluntarily surrender the rights conferred upon him by the stockholders ?\u00a0 It is not disputed that a resignation <i>per verba<\/i> is just as effective and binding as a resignation <i>per seripta<\/i>.\u00a0 It is claimed by the respondents that the petitioner did, on the 126th of September, 1912, resign, voluntarily, unequivocally, and absolutely, as a member of said board of directors. Proof upon that question was offered pro and con.\u00a0 It becomes necessary, therefore, to examine the proof upon that question.<br\/><br\/>It may be observed that the proof can not be read without creating the impression that there existed among certain members of the board at said meeting more or less feeling towards the petitioner on account of the fact that he was insisting upon making an investigation into certain credits of the bank.\u00a0 It appears that at the meeting of the board of the 26th of September, 1912, a renewal of the discussion relating to such credits took place and that personal feeling ran high.\u00a0 Certain members of the board did not hesitate to make remarks which seemed to reflect upon the personal honor of others.\u00a0 It was at this time and under these conditions, when some members of the board were apparently much excited, when it is alleged that the respondent unequivocally resigned his position.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the record that the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting of the 26th of September, 1912, such as were kept by the secretary, were destroyed; that two or three meetings of the board or of certain members of the board were held afterwards, for the purpose of preparing other minutes of said meeting, and that the minutes of said meeting were finally prepared nearly a month (Oct. 24, 1912) after the facts which they relate actually took place.\u00a0 At none of these subsequent meetings at which said minutes were prepare was the petitioner present, and, so far as the record shows, he had no notice thereof.\u00a0 The minutes thus prepared were presented as proof at the hearing of the cause, for the purpose of showing that the petitioner had resigned.<br\/><br\/>The minutes of the transactions of a board such as the present, prepared by its secretary or some person named or appointed for the purpose of keeping a record of the proceedings, are generally accepted, once approved by the board, as <i>prima facie<\/i> evidence of what actually took place during that meeting. This is true upon the theory that the secretary is, for the time being, the hand of the board. In the present case the minutes were not prepared by the secretary. <i>His<\/i> minutes had been destroyed. The minutes presented in evidence were prepared by the board itself, or by certain members of the same, arid then, too, in the absence of the petitioner.\u00a0 It is also a fact that said minutes were prepared after the president of the board had received a letter from the petitioner, dated September 28, 1912, two days after the alleged resignation was made, in which he (the petitioner) expressly indicated that he did not intend to resign from his position as a member of such board.<br\/><br\/>At the meeting of the said board of directors on the 26th of September, 1912, according to the minutes, there were fourteen members present.\u00a0 At that meeting, the petitioner, during a heated discussion between himself and other members, arose and left the room, giving certain reasons for his action.\u00a0 The respondents claim that at that time the petitioner resigned as a member.\u00a0 The petitioner says that he did not resign.\u00a0 If the petitioner did resign at that time and it was so understood by the members of the board, it would seem that the members would be able to agree upon the words used by the petitioner in so resigning.\u00a0 We will examine the proof, for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not a preponderance of the same shows that the petitioner did, in fact, resign at the time he left the said meeting, or whether or not he simply withdrew from said meeting in disgust.\u00a0 No rule or requirement has been called to our attention making it necessary for him to remain at any meeting of the board longer than his own pleasure might dictate.<br\/><br\/>With reference to what actually took place at the meeting of the board in question, the minutes ought to give us some light. Referring to the minutes (Exhibit 1), we find that the minutes record the following.\u00a0 The minutes say that the petitioner \"Mr. Brias then arose from his seat and in a violent tone and a rather disconcerted attitude addressed the board, saying that he could not decently continue to belong to a corporation whose president denied him the quality of honesty and one of whose members styled him an obstructionist; and that therefore he withdrew from it and ceased to attend its meetings.\"<br\/><br\/>In this quotation from the minutes, it will appear that an attempt was made to quote exactly what the petitioner said at the time he left the meeting of the board. It would be difficult, if that statement was all the information which we had, to conclude that the defendant intended to resign as a member of said board.\u00a0 Accepting the minutes as a true statement of what occurred, they simply show that the petitioner \"could not continue to belong to a corporation\" etc., \"and therefore he withdrew from it and ceased to attend its meetings.\"<br\/><br\/>It will be noted that no words are here attributed to the petitioner which indicate that he then and there absolutely and unequivocally resigned.\u00a0 The most that can be said is that he \"ceased to attend its meetings.\"\u00a0 No words are attributed to him, even by said minutes, which show conclusively that the petitioner did then and there resign.<br\/><br\/>From an examination of the proof adduced during the trial of the cause, we find that the members of the board of directors who declared as witnesses do not agree exactly with said minutes as to just what was said and done by the petitioner at the time he arose and left' the meeting on the 26th of September, 1912.<br\/><br\/>Referring to the declarations of the witnesses, we find that the petitioner gives the following explanation of what took place at said meeting, with reference to the question here presented, which in many important ways differs from the facts as recorded in the minutes:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Did you attend the meeting of September 26?\u2014A, Yes, sir; and it was there that the report of the committee was read.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Did you remain in the meeting of the board until its conclusion that day?\u2014A.\u00a0 Until its conclusion, no.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. State briefly your reason for not remaining there until its conclusion.\u2014A.\u00a0 Because in discussing the matter of the P20,000 that had been paid to Mr. Javellana I asked the president, up to the point of obtaining from him a confession that in fact the P20,000 had been paid to Mr. Javellana for warehouse expenses, adding that it was an injustice that had been done that gentleman. Then I made plain that my objection to approving his action with regard to the sugar when report was made thereof after the close of the meeting of August 15 was, therefore, well founded, for the directors approved it over my objection, and as Mr. Moreta had just said that I was an obstructionist, I wished to demonstrate that I was aware of cause for objecting; and I said that I knew that Mr. Javellana had been paid P20,000 so that he would desist from suing the bank for the illegal sale of his sugar.\u00a0 I had a letter that Mr. Javellana had addressed to the firm of Brias Hermanos, a commercial letter, thanking it for the sale of its shares in the bank and giving his opinion of the sale, and saying that the treatment he had received from the bank had been bad, for he had lost over P100,000 and that the P20,000 were secured by a deal, it thus being that after he had been a patron of the bank for fifteen years it had treated him in such a bad way; discussing heatedly the matter of Mr. Javellana, the president, through spite or whatever it was, insulted me; he told me that he had previously proffered other insulting remarks to me, that he prided himself on his frankness and that I was not at all frank and that there are men who pass for being honest who are not so and that I was one of them.\u00a0 Indignant, and not knowing what to do, I thought the most, prudent thing was to take the door instead of a chair or some other object, and I said that I was withdrawing from the meeting because I could not submit to being insulted. I withdrew, the president called to me and said: 'I understand that you are tendering your resignation.'\u00a0 And I replied: <i>\"I shall tender my resignation.'<\/i> Then I left, but first I called the secretary's attention to the fact that I wished it recorded in the minutes that my withdrawal from that meeting was due to the fact that Mr. Moreta had said that I was an obstructionist, and that the president had addressed a discourteous remark to me, that is, that I am not an honest man, and that I could not remain in a meeting where I was insulted.\"<\/blockquote>Referring to the declaration of Mr. Hord, president of the board, we find that he, among other things, declared during the trial of the cause as follows, in which he attempts to relate the language used by the petitioner when he left the room on the occasion when it is alleged he resigned:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. And when Mr. Brias arose did you call to him to deny the remark attributed to you?\u2014A. He had stopped.\u00a0 He had said that he resigned. That I had insulted him: what I had just said.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. In what words did he say that he resigned?-A. I resign. I withdraw.\u00a0 No; I can't tell exactly the words, but two or three times in that meeting <i>he wished to resign; we advised him not to do so and he agreed to remain on the committee of credits.\"<\/i><br\/><br\/>Mr. Felix Roxas, another member of the board, after relating more or less of what actually occurred at the meeting, also attempts to state exactly what the petitioner said at the time he left the meeting of the board, relating to the question before us:<br\/><br\/>\"Q. With what words did he resign?\u2014A.\u00a0 He said that he was leaving there because he had not been treated right, something of that kind.\u00a0 I don't remember his words exactly, but he intimated that he would appeal to the general,meeting and that he was leaving. He insistently manifested his desire to withdraw and quit the position.\"<\/blockquote>Mr. Phil. C. Whitaker, another member of the board, attempts to explain just what happened and just what was said by the petitioner at the time he left the meeting of the board. Mr. Whitaker said:<br\/><blockquote>\"A. Mr. Moreta tried to pacify him.\u00a0 He appealed to him and told him not to take that action, but Mr. Brias insisted and arose saying that he resigned.\u00a0 Thereupon Mr. Barrera called to him, when he was going away, or rather when he was descending the stairs from the platform and called his attention to the fact that he had been appointed or designated to appear before the committee to investigate doubtful accounts, or what he alleged were doubtful, and he said that there was no need because <i>he was going to resign.<\/i> Thereupon Mr. Hord called to him and asked him if he would tender his resignation in writing, and Mr. Brias said yes, that in the morning he would send it in writing and he left the room.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Did he say that he was going to resign or that he had resigned ?<br\/><br\/>\"Mr. Cohn. I object to the question for it tends to impugn the witness's own testimony.<br\/><br\/>\"A. He said that he was resigning.\"<\/blockquote>Mr. Emilio Moreta, another member of the board, attempts to state exactly what occurred at the time it is alleged the petitioner resigned. Mr. Moreta said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. And after that was he addressed by the president?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Did Mr. Hord ask if he would tender his resignation in writing?\u2014A.\u00a0 That was after what was said by Mr. Barrera, who called to him saying:\u00a0 'How can you withdraw, when you have just agreed with us to form part of the investigating committee?'\u00a0 These were Mr. Barrera's words, approximately.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What did Mr. Brias reply?\u2014A.\u00a0 I don't,remember, but he insisted; the president addressed other words to him and Mr. Brias left the meeting.\"<\/blockquote>The declarations of the other members of the board of directors are much to the same effect as those which we have quoted above.<br\/><br\/>Comparing the alleged statement of the petitioner, as given by the different members of the board, in which his resignation was couched, with his alleged statement as found in the minutes (Exhibit 1), we find that there is a marked and irreconcilable conflict. Some of the witnesses for the respondents say that the petitioner said that \"he was resigning;\" others that \"he was. going to resign;\" while the minutes (Exhibit 1) say that the petitioner said \"he could not continue to belong to a corporation\" etc., \"and that therefore he withdrew from it and ceased to attend its meetings.\"<br\/><br\/>It will be noted that the minutes fail to put into the mouth of the petitioner the words \"he was resigning\" or the phrase \"he was going to resign.\" It is quite evident that in preparing the minutes it was intended by those preparing them to make them show just what the petitioner did and said.\u00a0 This fact is indicated not only by the fact that they expressly assume to state what the petitioner said, but also by the fact that they relate in detail things which are not ordinarily included in minutes.\u00a0 It is very unusual to find in the minutes of an association or corporation a detailed statement of what was said and done by members in a passionate discussion of certain questions.\u00a0 The result of such discussions is generally considered sufficient for the minutes.<br\/><br\/>In the irreconcilable conflict between what the said minutes make the petitioner say and what the members say he said, we find an important fact, to wit: that the members are not clear in their understanding of just exactly what the petitioner said with reference to the alleged resignation.\u00a0 That some of the members did not, at that moment, fully understand or believe that the petitioner had resigned is supported by the facts:<br\/><br\/>(<i>a<\/i>) That the president then and there \"asked him if he would send in writing the resignation he had just tendered verbally;\" and<br\/><br\/>(<i>b<\/i>) That a member of the board, Mr. Enrique Barrera, at the time the petitioner was leaving the meeting of the board, asked him if he desired to continue to take part in the meetings of the committee on credits.<br\/><br\/>If the petitioner had resigned, at the time and in the manner alleged, then he had forfeited his right to act in any relation with the board.\u00a0 His resignation <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">per verba<\/span> was sufficient. No formal acceptance of his resignation was necessary; neither was it necessary to make an entry thereof in the minutes of the board. While this is true, it must, however, appear that he positively and affirmatively: stated or indicated that it was his intention to resign then and there.\u00a0 If there was the slightest condition attached to his statement relating to his resignation, then ,it was not a resignation.\u00a0 A mere statement by a member that he withdraws from a meeting or that he will have nothing more to do with the office is not sufficient upon which to predicate an absolute resignation.<br\/><br\/>That members of boards become momentarily disgusted with the method of procedure of their associates and withdraw, is not an infrequent occurrence.\u00a0 For the associates to take advantage of this common weakness of men and distort the momentary action into a meaning really not intended or justified by actual and positive words, would be to do great and irrevocable injustice to their fellows.<br\/><br\/>In addition to what has been said above, which throws some doubt upon just what the petitioner said and did relating to his alleged resignation, we have his own statement The petitioner states what took place at the meeting substantially as the respondents do, except as to the exact word or phrase used in relation to his alleged resignation.\u00a0 The petitioner says that he said, \"I shall tender my resignation.\"\u00a0 This statement is not altogether in conflict with what Mr. Whitaker says the petitioner said and is in entire harmony with what Mr. Hord and Mr. Barrera believed at the time, if their respective questions presented at that time correctly indicate what each had in mind.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the above positive statement by the petitioner himself, we have the fact that one full day after said meeting, he wrote a letter to the president of the board, in which he signs himself as still a member and in which he says that he. had not resigned.\u00a0 No one knows better than the petitioner himself what was in his mind and what he said at the time he withdrew from said meeting.\u00a0 To conclude that his testimony given at the trial of the present cause and his letter of September 28, 1912, are not in accord with the real facts, as he believed they were, would be to attribute to the petitioner a quality of mind which we believe even the respondents would not maintain. Men are liable to err, and innocently.\u00a0 All men are liable to have misunderstandings. In the heat of passion men are liable to make, momentarily, their wishes the mother of their thoughts. Under such circumstances men are liable to have things done which their passions desire to have done. We must remember that accurate weights are ascertained after the beam of the scales has become quiet and not during the time that it is quivering with the suddenness of the weight placed upon it.\u00a0 We fully believe that the conflict between the members of the board and the petitioner with reference to just what was done and the real intention of the petitioner grows out of the differences which existed at that time and not out of any intention, to do any person a wrong.\u00a0 A man may be ever so honest and yet be absolutely wrong in his understanding of certain facts. In practically every civil action each of the parties thinks and honestly believes that he is right.\u00a0 That fact, however, does not prevent it being shown and demonstrated that one or the other is absolutely mistaken. For that purpose, among other things, dispassionate courts are established.<br\/><br\/>For all of the foregoing reasons and after a careful examination of the proof, we are forced to the conclusion that the record fails to show that the petitioner did resign his position as a member of the board of directors of the respondent bank. We therefore find that he is entitled to exercise all of the rights, privileges, and emoluments belonging and pertaining to a member of said board.<br\/><br\/>Therefore the prayer of the petitioner is hereby granted and it is hereby ordered and decreed that the extraordinary writ of mandamus be issued, directing the respondents and requiring them and each of them, to fully and freely admit the petitioner into the use, exercise, and enjoyment of the office of the board of directors of said corporation and as a member of the committee on credits of the board of directors thereof; and to enjoy and to freely exercise all of the rights and privileges belonging and pertaining to each of the members of the board of directors of the respondent bank, which are granted to them under the laws of the Philippine Islands and the regulations of said bank.<br\/><br\/>It is so ordered, with costs against the respondents.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C J., Torres, Mapa<\/i>, and <i>Johnson, JJ<\/i>.<br\/><i>Moreland, J<\/i>., dissents. <\/div>",

that said petitioner was brought before a board of special inquiry, which board heard a number of witnesses, all of whom testified that the petitioner was a minor less than 21 years of age, and that said board received no testimony whatever to the effect that said petitioner was more than 21 years of age; that the said board unjustly, arbitrarily, and in abuse of its authority and of the rights of the petitioner,\u00a0 refused to hear a certain material witness presented by the said petitioner; and that said board, in violation of the rights of the plaintiff and in abuse of its authority and discretion, denied entry to the petitioner and excluded him from the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 It is further alleged that an appeal was taken to the Insular Collector of Customs, who affirmed the decision of the board in violation of the rights of the petitioner.<br\/><br\/>The facts appearing from the record show the arrival of the petitioner at the port of Manila from Amoy, China, on or about July 22, 1910; that his right to land was inquired into by a board of special inquiry duly authorized thereunto, hearings being held on July 22, 28 and 29, 1910.\u00a0 Upon the first hearing the board decided that the said Tan Beko was the legitimate son of Tan Tee-Co but that Tan Beko was more than 21 years of age and was, therefore, not a minor son of a resident Chinese merchant within the meaning of the Chinese Exclusion Law, and declined to permit the entry.\u00a0 A motion\u00a0 for a rehearing was made and granted on the 5th day of August, 1910,\u00a0 On the termination of said rehearing the board again rendered a decision adverse to the right of the petitioner to enter the Philippine Islands, basing it upon the ground that Tan Tee-Co, the father of the petitioner, was not a merchant within the meaning of the Chinese exclusion laws and that\u00a0 the petitioner himself was more than 21 years of age.\u00a0 On the 19th\u00a0 of August, 1910, another application for a rehearing was made which was granted on the 22d of that month.\u00a0 At said rehearing testimony was again received regarding the right of the petitioner to enter the Philippine Islands, after which the board again rendered a decision adverse to the right of the petitioner, holding that while he\u00a0 might be considered the legitimate son of Tan Tee-Co, as he claimed, and that the latter was a merchant within the meaning of the Chinese exclusion laws, still the petitioner was not entitled to enter because of the fact that he was more than 21 years of age.<br\/><br\/>An appeal having been taken to the Insular Collector of Customs, the decision of the board was affirmed.<br\/><br\/>The main question presented by the appellant in this case is that the board of special inquiry rendered a decision adverse to the appellant without any evidence before it to sustain such decision.\u00a0 It is true that no witness was sworn before the board on behalf of the Government or against the claim of the petitioner.\u00a0 The board, however, made a thorough examination of the person of the petitioner and, after such examination, came to the conclusion that he was not a minor but was a person of full age.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that the person of an alien seeking admission into the Philippine Islands is evidence in an investigation by the board of special inquiry to determine his right to enter and that the board may take his appearance into consideration to determine or to assist in determining not only the age of the applicant but the credibility of the witnesses who testify as to his age; and that, therefore, the decision of the board in this case, based upon the appearance of the applicant, is not without evidence to sustain it.<br\/><br\/>We have held in numerous cases that we will not interfere with the decision of the board of special inquiry upon the facts when it appears that there is evidence supporting the decision.\u00a0 The board is not obliged to believe the testimony of witnesses that an applicant is 10 years of age when it is apparent from his appearance that he is 40; and although such a determination is much more easy than is that of whether an applicant is 20 or 21, still the same principle is involved, namely, the right of the board to determine from the appearance of the applicant his apparent age.<br\/><br\/>Another error assigned by the appellant is that during the\u00a0 hearing before the board Tay Chico was called as a witness on behalf of the petitioner and stated that he was a merchant residing at Pagbilao, Tayabas, and that he had left his certificate of residence and his cedula at home.\u00a0 The board refused to permit the witness to testify without first presenting his cedula as required by Act No. 1189 of the Philippine Commission.\u00a0 This refusal to hear the witness occurred on the 29th of July, 1910.\u00a0 Thereafter hearings were granted on the 5th and again on the 22d of August.<br\/><br\/>It is evident therefore that the witness had ample time to obtain his certificate and cedula and qualify himself as a witness and that his failure to do so was the fault either of himself or of the person who called him as a witness, Moreover, this witness was not again presented.<br\/><br\/>We find no error which calls for a reversal of the judgment.\u00a0 It is, therefore, affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Rep., 519).\u00a0 The action brought was for the recovery of possession of six parcels of land and rested on a title of composition with the State, issued to Puruganan and recorded in the property registry in 1895.\u00a0 The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur held that the plaintiff had established his right of ownership of the lands described in the complaint and sentenced the defendants to deliver them to him.\u00a0 The defendants appealed and this court held:\u00a0 \"One of the essential requisites in an action of recovery is to fix the identity of the filing that the party desires to recover, a fact which has unquestionably been accomplished by Puruganan by the proof submitted by him, the four defendants not having duly shown that the area and boundaries of the land detained by them were different from those stated in the complaint.\"\u00a0 Therefore the judgment appealed from was affirmed.<br\/><br\/>Upon the issuance of the appropriate writ of execution, it was served by the sheriff on August 13, 1908.\u00a0 Antonio M. de Castro, the surveyor who surveyed the lands before the title of composition with the State was issued, was present at the execution.\u00a0 Owing to the objections raised during these proceedings, the new measurement of the six parcels of land was postponed until the following day, the 14th, and when accomplished, with the attendance of two of the defendants, the writ was served in the manner set forth in the following returns:<br\/><blockquote>\"In view of the result of the rectification made, the statement of the boundaries mentioned (owners of the adjacent properties), corroborated by the expert witness, Antonio M. de Castro, and of the authentic information gathered I, the undersigned deputy sheriff, convinced that the aforementioned properties are the same as those specified in the writ of execution, made delivery and gave possession of them to Cirilo Puruganan, represented by his son, Juan Puruganan and enjoined upon the defendants, who were present, that thenceforth they must recognize the said Cirilo Puruganan as the lawful and true owner of the aforesaid properties.\"<\/blockquote>On August 14, 1908, the plaintiff was put in possession of the lands referred to in his title.<br\/><br\/>But now come Nicolas Mariano and 18 other persons, on October 22, 1910, two years and two months afterwards, and bring the present suit against the heirs of Cirilo Puruganan (for he himself had died in the meantime), and request a nullification of the possession given to Cirilo Puruganan and that his heirs be sentenced to deliver to the plaintiffs the said lands in the defendants' possession, to pay a certain amount of unhulled rice,\u00a0 or its equivalent in the sum of P848, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>In this new suit the heirs of the party who was the plaintiff in the previous action, presented for the second time their title\u00a0 deed and other documents establishing their ownership sustained in two instances, by the lower court and the Supreme Court.\u00a0 The former held, in the judgment rendered in the previous case, that:\u00a0 \"The\u00a0 plaintiff Puruganan sued for the six parcels of land in question and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">proved<\/span> his claim by an ownership title recorded in the property registry in the year 1895, by receipts attesting the payment of the land tax, and by the testimony of witnesses.\"\u00a0 Furthermore that:\u00a0 \"The ownership of the plaintiff, Cirilo Puruganan, to the lands described in the complaint, having been established, and as the defendants\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 have proved nothing, *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 the court holds that the plaintiff is the owner of the said lands, and sentences the defendants, Teodoro Martin, Ramon\u00a0 Barroga, Julian Ventura, and Miguel Agustin (those in possession) to deliver the same to the plaintiff.\"<br\/><br\/>Now the same lower court, in view of the complaint of the 19 plaintiffs in the second suit, who claim to be the possessors of the six parcels of land in question instead of those four defendants before mentioned, has sentenced the Puruganans to deliver to these 19 plaintiffs the lands rightly won from those four parties who held or rather detained them.\u00a0 This sentence was based on the finding that such lands do not exist or do not appear in the place designated in the title, and that the six parcels of land ordered in this case to be delivered are exactly equal in area to the five parcels of land described in the <i>complaint<\/i>, in the <i>title<\/i> and in the <i>writ of execution<\/i>, but do not in all respects agree in their boundaries with those described in the writ of execution, nor with the plaintiff's complaint and title.\u00a0 This is the point that must be elucidated in this appeal.<br\/><br\/>First parcel, in Gambeng.\u2014According to the title, complaint and writ of execution, contains 3 hectares and 85 ares; is bounded on the north by the lands of Isidora Dancel, on the east and south by those of Bernabe de los Santos (now those of Domingo Caluya), and on the west by the property of Jose Dancel (now that of Carlos Abadilla).\u00a0 Description in writ of execution:\u00a0 \"A parcel of land 3\u00a0 hectares and 85 ares in area;

bounded on the north by the land of Bernabe Peralta, on the east by that of Jose Dancel (the same party mentioned in the above description of the first parcel, as an adjacent holder on the west), on the south by that of this same Jose Dancel, and on the west by that of Jose Agbayani.\u00a0 Description in writ:\u00a0 \"Forty ares and 80 centares (a part of this land, consisting of the difference between this measurement and that of the 71 ares and 70 cen tares, was washed away by the river); bounded on the north by the land formerly held by Bernabe Peralta and now by Domingo Caluya, on the south and east by the property previously in the possession of Jose Dancel and now held by the heirs of Liberato Abadilla, among them Carlos Abadilla, who declared that it belonged to him and his coheirs, and on the west by the land formerly belonging to Jose Agbayani and now occupied by the river.\"<br\/><br\/>Third parcel, in Corcuera.\u2014Area, 1 hectare and 18 ares; bounded on the north by lands of Liberato Abadilla, on the east by those of Cirilo Talon, on the south by those of Bernabe Peralta, and on the west by those of Ceferino Mina.\u00a0 Description in writ:\u00a0 \"One hectare and 18 ares; bounded on the north by the lands formerly held by Liberato Abadilla and now by his heirs, on the south by that formerly of Bernabe Peralta and now of Domingo Caluya, on the west by the land previously held by Ceferino Mina and now by his heir and by Isidora Dancel, and on the east by that formerly possessed by Cirilo Talon and now by Joaquin Madamba.\"<br\/><br\/>Fourth parcel, in Corcuera.\u2014Area, 43 ares and 5 centares; bounded on the north by lands of the church, on the east by those of Bernabe Peralta, on the south by a trail, and on the west by the property of Liberato\u00a0 Abadilla.\u00a0 Description in writ:\u00a0 \"Forty three ares and 5 centares; bounded on the north by lands of the church, on the south by a trail that formerly existed and now occupied by Teodoro Martin, on the west by the property formerly of Bernabe Peralta and now of Domingo Caluya, and on the west by that previously held by Liberato Abadilla and now by his heirs.\"<br\/><br\/>Fifth parcel, in Corcuera.\u2014Area, 1 hectare 57 ares and 95 centares bounded on the north by a watercourse, on the east by the lands of Bernabe Peralta, on the south by the Gasgas River, and on the west by the property of the aforementioned Abadilla.\u00a0 Description in writ:\u00a0 \"One hectare 57 ares and 95 centares; bounded on the north by a water-course, on the east by the land previously held by Bernabe Peralta and now by Domingo Caluya, on the south formerly by the Gasgas River and now by the land occupied by Teodoro Martin, <i>one<\/i> of the <i>defendants<\/i>, and which was formerly a part of the river bed, but, by a change in the course of the stream toward the south, became arable, and on the west by the property formerly held by Liberato Abadilla and now by his heirs.\u00a0 This property was indicated by the said Teodoro Martin as being the same land which was previously put into the possession of the plaintiff and the latter affirmed it to be such.\"<br\/><br\/>Sixth parcel, in Corcuera.\u2014Area, 15 ares; bounded on the north by a trail, on the east by the land of Bernabe Peralta, on the south by the Gasgas River, and on the west by the property of the aforesaid Abadilla.\u00a0 Description in writ:\u00a0 \"Fifteen ares; bounded on the north formerly by a trail and now occupied by Flaviano Martin, on the south formerly by the Gasgas River and now by the land occupied by Pedro Corotan which formerly was a part of the river bed, but, by a change in the\u00a0 course of the stream toward the south, became arable, on the west by the land previously held by Liberato Abadilla and now by his heirs, and on the east by that before\u00a0 occupied by Bernabe Peralta and now by Gregorio Dichoso.\"<br\/><br\/>Domingo Caluya testified that he held lands in Gambeng, purchased from Bernabe Peralta and adjoining those in dispute; and Carlos Abadilla, that, twenty years before, his deceased uncle Liberato Abadilla purchased from Jose Dancel the lands adjoining those in question, also the latter.\u00a0 Neither of these two witnesses was contradicted.<br\/><br\/>Two of the defendants in the previous suit, Ramon Barroga and Julio Ventura, were witnesses for the herein plaintiffs and testified that Cirilo Puruganan took possession, not only of the lands of the defendants in that other suit, but also of those of the plaintiffs in the present one.<br\/><br\/>If, besides the lands won from the defendants in the present suit, there had been included in the possession given the plaintiff in that suit the other lands which the plaintiffs in' this case claim as theirs, then the sheriff would have awarded a greater area of land than that specified in the title, in the complaint, and in the writ of execution; but it has been hereinabove demonstrated that the same area is mentioned in the title, in the complaint, in the writ of execution, and in the proceedings had thereon.\u00a0 Consequently, the testimony of the said two witnesses is unworthy of credence and, though it were credible, the suit should have hinged on the excess of area, and not on the alleged nonexistence, of the lands described in the Puruganans' title of ownership.<br\/><br\/>And, as the area is the same, the substitution of some boundaries for\u00a0 others showing the location of the land, instead, of the boundaries expressed in the title, in the complaint, and in the writ of execution, does not alter the identity of the parcels which have already come within the scope of <i>res adjudicata.<\/i><br\/><br\/>Proof that there exists property which corresponds to the title of composition, of the extension and limits expressed by the latter, evidences that the real property awarded by execution of judgment belongs to him who obtained from the State the said title, which is a lawful one that conveys the land from the tenancy of the original and sovereign owner thereof to that of him who applied for its acquisition and award by composition; and against such title of ownership inscribed in the property registry, mere possession cannot avail, even when proven and still less when not so shown.\u00a0 In this second suit, possession has not been proved by any title whatsoever either of acquisition or transfer of ownership, but was based on a fact, merely affirmed by some witnesses, and these unworthy of credence because of their endeavor to establish in this suit such mere fact of possession, while in previous suits it was established in another diametrically opposite.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is reversed and the defendants are absolved from the complaint, without special finding as to costs in this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapa, Johnson, Carson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur. <\/div>",

CHUA LUI DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the city of Manila convicting Chua Lui and Koh Kieng Sien of the illegal possession of opium and sentencing the said Chua Lui to five years' imprisonment and to pay one-fourth of the costs and Koh Kieng Sien to six months' imprisonment and to pay one-fourth of the costs.\u00a0 The two other defendants who were jointly charged with Chua Lui and Koh Kieng Sien were acquitted.\u00a0 Koh Kieng Sien did not appeal.<br\/><br\/>In the early part of March, 1913, Chua Lui, a resident of the city of Manila, became one of the parties to a written lease in which he secured the possession, use and occupation of a house in Caloocan, a short distance beyond the city limits of the city of Manila, for a period of five years.\u00a0 Soon after the execution of the lease Chua Lui, Chua Tong and Chua Bee Cho moved into the house and occupied the same.\u00a0 Two or three weeks later George W. Marshall, acting chief of secret service of Manila, in company with three other American officers and one Filipino officer, went to the house.\u00a0 At the approach of the officers Koh Kieng Sien jumped\u00a0 from the rear window of the house and ran across the fields.\u00a0 The\u00a0 officers gave chase, overtook, and arrested the fleeing Chinaman.\u00a0 They testified that\u00a0 the fugitive had with him a piece of bamboo containing an opium pipe and a can of opium and that when he saw himself hard pressed he threw them away, evidently hoping to dispose of the incriminating evidence in such a way as to deceive the officers.\u00a0 Having captured Koh Kieng Sien, the officers then arrested Chua Lui, Chua Tong, and Chua Bee Cho and preferred against them the following charge:<br\/><blockquote>\"The undersigned accuses Chua\u00a0 Lui, <i>alias<\/i> Chua Lui Sane, <i>alias<\/i> Luis Sane, Chua Tong, Chua Bee Cho, and Koh Kieng Sien of a violation of section 31 of Act No. 1761 of the Philippine Commission, as amended by section 3 of Act No. 1910 of the Philippine Legislature, committed as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"That on or about the 25th day of March, 1913, in the municipality of Caloocan, Province of Rizal, Philippine Islands, within 2\u00bd miles from the limits of the city of Manila, P. I., and within the jurisdiction of this court, the said accused conspiring among themselves and helping each other, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously have in their possession and under their control and knowingly in their premises about 75 grams of opium.\u00a0 Contrary to law.\"<\/blockquote>It is admitted that after a very close and thorough search of the house and premises no opium was found or anything which led to the\u00a0 suspicion that there had been opium on the premises at any time except that found in the possession of Koh Kieng Sien.\u00a0 It is also\u00a0 conceded, as a necessary result, that unless the fact that the accused Koh Kieng Sien had the opium in his possession is sufficient to convict the other occupants of the house of the crime charged the prosecution must fail.\u00a0 It is the undisputed evidence in the case, except by mere inference, that Koh Kieng Sien, the only person who was found in the possession of opium, was a casual visitor at the house, having been there but a few hours when the policemen arrived; that he was then under sentence following a conviction of a violation of the Opium Law; that the reason of his presence at the house at that time was to borrow money of the accused Chua Lui to pay the fine imposed upon him by such sentence.<br\/><br\/>All of the accused, except Koh Kieng Sien, denied that they had had possession of opium or that there was opium in the house, and they denied all knowledge of the fact that Koh Kieng Sien had opium in his possession at the time.<br\/><br\/>There is some claim on the part of the prosecution that Koh Kieng Sien was engaged in smoking opium just prior to the arrival of the police officials, and that the other accused, being then in the house, must have known that fact.\u00a0 It is asserted that there was an odor of opium fumes in the house when it was entered by the police and that the pipe found in the possession of Koh Kieng Sien was still warm. There is not entire agreement among the police officials relative to these\u00a0 facts.\u00a0 Some claimed to have noticed the odor, others did\u00a0 not; some claimed to have observed the warmth of the pipe, others did not.\u00a0 We doubt very much if there is evidence sufficient to establish clearly that Koh Kieng Sien was engaged in smoking opium when the officers arrived.\u00a0 There are facts and circumstances, in addition to the absolute denial of the accused, which go to show that such an allegation is not altogether well founded.\u00a0 It seems that the same officers who made the arrests, or part of them, had visited and searched the house the night before; that on the following morning the inmates thereof, in company with\u00a0 the <i>teniente<\/i> of the barrio, went to a justice of the peace for the purpose of making a complaint against the officers for the unlawful entry of their premises; that the justice of the peace requiring more evidence, the accused, in company with the <i>teniente<\/i> of the barrio, returned to the house, arriving there but a few minutes before the appearance of the police which resulted in their arrest.\u00a0 There was present, therefore, at the house at the time it is claimed that Koh Kieng Sien was engaged in smoking opium, the <i>teniente<\/i> of the barrio, who was an officer of the law and whose business it was to prevent the commission of crime.\u00a0 He testified that there was no opium being smoked there at that time.\u00a0 It should be noticed also that Koh Kieng Sien was at the house but temporarily; that he was there on a business matter; that in all probability he brought the contraband articles with him and he certainly took them away with him when he attempted to escape; that there was no lamp found in the house in such condition or in such a place that it could have been used by Koh Kieng Sien.\u00a0 Moreover it should be noted that the house having been searched or at least visited, the night before, by the police, the accused were fully aware that they were under surveillance, and if they were engaged in the commission of crime, they had every reason to believe that they were liable to be apprehended at any moment.\u00a0 But even if it be true that Koh Kieng Sien was smoking opium, it has not been\u00a0 shown that any of the other accused were aware of it.\u00a0 Certainly the <i>teniente<\/i> of the barrio knew nothing of it, and the accused and he were talking together at the time.<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs.<\/i> De los Reyes (20 PhiL Rep.,\u00a0 467), it appeared that a few days prior to the 5th of November, 1910, one Gabriela Esguerra, who lived in San Miguel de Mayumo, being a friend of De los Reyes and his wife, came to visit them at their home in the city of Manila.\u00a0 While Gabriela was still there, certain revenue officials went to the house to search for opium.\u00a0 While some of the officers were in the house prosecuting the search therein, others were on the outside watching to see that no one left the house.\u00a0 During the progress of the search in the front part of the house one of the officers outside saw the accused Gabriela throw a package from the window of the kitchen into the grass.\u00a0 Upon recovering the package it was found to contain a considerable quantity of morphine.\u00a0 Upon these facts together with his refusal to permit the officers to enter the house, the trial court convicted De los Reyes of the crime of illegal possession of opium.\u00a0 Upon an appeal to this court, the judgment was reversed upon the ground that the mere fact that a temporary visitor at the house of De los Reyes had in her possession a quantity of morphine and that fearing discovery she threw it from the window of his kitchen was not sufficient to charge him with knowledge of the fact in such a way as to make him liable for the fact that the opium was on his premises.<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Tan Tayco (12\u00a0 Phil. Rep., 739), the court said at page 743:<br\/><blockquote>\"Possession has been defined to be the detention or enjoyment of a thing which a man holds or exercises by himself or by\u00a0 another who keeps or exercises it in his name.\u00a0 (Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Rawles' Revision, Vol. II.)\u00a0 Clearly it involves' a state of mind on the part of the possessor whereby he intends to exercise, and as a consequence of which, he does exercise a right of possession,\u00a0 whether that right be legal or otherwise; and while the intention and the will to\u00a0 possess may be, and usually are, inferred from\u00a0 the- fact that the thing in question is under the apparent power and control of the alleged possessor, nevertheless, the existence of the <i>animus possidendi<\/i> is subject to contradiction, and may be rebutted by evidence which tends to prove that the person under whose power and control the thing in question appears to be does not in fact exercise such power of control and does not intend to do so.\u00a0 In order to complete a possession two things are required,\u00a0 that there be an occupancy, apprehension or taking; that the taking be with an intent to possess (<i>animus possidendi<\/i>),\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"The statements of the witness Abila\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 furnish a full, satisfactory and sufficient explanation of the presence of the utensils for smoking opium in his house at the time of their seizure, which is entirely consistent with the allegations of the defendant that those utensils were not at the time in their possession; and, therefore, entirely consistent with the innocence of the defendants charged with a violation of the provisions of the Opium Act.\"<\/blockquote>There is no evidence in the record showing or tending to show that\u00a0 the house occupied by the accused was an \"opium joint' or that it had been built or constructed for that purpose, or that it had been changed and modified by the appellant Chua Lui so as to make it an \"opium den,\" or that it had any of the qualities, whatever they may be, of such a resort, or that he intended to use it for any illicit purpose.\u00a0 There is no evidence in the record showing or tending to show that Chua Lui was acquainted with any gang of opium smugglers or persons connected\u00a0 with such gang, or that he was himself connected therewith or with such persons, or that he had ever been\u00a0 convicted of any violation of the Opium Law.\u00a0 Even though all these things were true, it does not necessarily follow\u00a0 that he is guilty of the crime charged.\u00a0 Persons may not be convicted on general principles, but only on evidence which establishes the precise charge lodged against them.<br\/><br\/>We are satisfied from the whole case that the guilt of the appellant has not been shown beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 The judgment of conviction is reversed and the accused acquitted.\u00a0 The sureties on his bond will be exonerated.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Christie, filed a brief for defendant in error. <\/p><p>Mr. Justice LAMAR delivered the opinion of the court:<\/p><p>Juan Pico, claiming the right as patrol to arrest suspicious persons in the hacienda of Maluno, within the municipality of Hagan, Province of Isabela, Philippine Islands, on March 1, 1909, entered the house of Eugenio Castellanes in the nighttime, and inquired if there was anyone else on the premises. He was told that there was a Chinaman asleep in the next room, and, going there with several attendants, ordered him to get up. Receiving no answer, Pico struck him with a gun. The Chinaman arose and seized the gun as Pico again attempted to strike him. After some altercation, he was overpowered and Pico ordered his attendants to bind him. This they did, putting a rope around his neck, tying his arms behind his back, and, in this condition, he was ordered out of the house for the purpose or being taken to the nearby hacienda, of which Pico was manager. Whether through unwillingness or physical inability resulting from the blow previously inflicted, does not clearly appear, but the Chinaman refused to walk, and Pico again struck him several times with the gun. Partly dragged and partly carried, the Chinaman was in a state of collapse when he reached the hacienda, where, a few hours later, he died. The next morning at 8 o'clock he was buried\u2014a medical employee on the estate giving a certificate that he had died of heart failure. The suspicion of the authorities having been aroused, the body was disinterred; and, as it exhibited signs of external violence, Pico and two of his attendants were arrested, Pico being charged \"with the crime of murder, with the qualifying circumstances of <em>alevosia<\/em> (treachery), as defined and penalized in article 403 of the Penal Code, in that * * * he feloniously ordered his two servants to seize and tie the Chinaman, GoSiengco, and thus tied and unable to defend himself, the said Pico, with the intention of killing the said Chinaman, struck him several blows with a shotgun, as the result of which blows the Chinaman subsequently died.\" .<\/p><p>The evidence for the Government was direct and positive, and left no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendant, unless the witnesses for the prosecution were unworthy of belief. Their credibility, though attacked, was sustained by the trial judge, who found the defendant guilty and sentenced him to <em>cadena temporal<\/em>, to be confined in the Bilibid Prison for the term of his natural life, with accessories named in article 54 of the code, and to pay the heirs of the Chinaman 1,000 pesos. A motion for a new trial was overruled, and on appeal the supreme court stated that only a question of fact was involved, and that the testimony for the Government, being direct and without elements of untruth, fully supported the findings of the trial court:<\/p><blockquote>\u00a0 <p>\"We have only one criticism of the judgment below. We are convinced that the court, in imposing the penalty, should have taken into consideration in favor of the accused the extenuating circumstance described in article 9, subdivision 3, of the Penal Code, namely, that 'the delinquent had no intention of committing so grave an injury as that which he inflicted.' There not having been present any aggravating circumstance, the penalty should have been imposed in its minimum degree.\" (15 Philippine, 549.)<\/p><\/blockquote><ol>\u00a0 <li>It is claimed that this finding was in legal effect an acquittal; and several decisions of the supreme court of Spain are cited to support the argument that there can be no \"murder with <em>alevosia<\/em>\" unless there was a specific intent to kill the person bound. We cannot so construe the Philippine Code. Under it the killing of a human being is parricide, murder, or homicide, depending, not always on the intent, but upon the relation of the parties and the circumstances under which and the means by which life was taken. On the trial of a charge of \"murder with premeditation,\" there might be call for proof of a specific intent, but even then that could usually be established only by external circumstances capable of proof. But in the case of murder with cruelty or with alevosia, the intent would be immaterial, although the accused might claim that he thought that the cruelty would not cause death, or that the beating would punish, and not destroy, the person who was bound. Under the\" Penal Code of the Philippines, as at common law, men are presumed to intend the natural consequences. of their act, and cannot escape punishment for taking life on the claim that they had not intended or expected that such consequence would result from what they purposely did.<\/li><\/ol><p>In this case Pico was not charged with \"murder with evident premeditation.\" As the Chinaman was, at the time, bound and defenseless, Pico was guilty of \"murder with the aggravating circumstances of alevosia,\" punishable by the minimum, medium, or maximum penalty, depending on the presence or absence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances, as defined by the code, which permitted effect to be given to the absence of a specific intent by a mitigation of the punishment. This we understand to be the effect of the decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, and not, as claimed, an acquittal of the charge on which Pico was tried. (United States <em>vs.<\/em> Brobst, 14 Philippine, 310; United States <em>vs.<\/em> Candelaria, 2 Philippine, 104.)<\/p><p>The decisions cited by plaintiff in error do not require a reversal, for none of them relate to a case like this,\" where the accused, having himself ordered his victim to be bound, consciously, intentionally, and repeatedly beat him with an instrument likely to produce death.<\/p><ol start=\"2\">\u00a0 <li>It was also contended that the complaint was defective in failing to allege that the Chinaman had been tied for the purpose of making defense impossible, and so that he might be killed without risk to the accused. This objection comes too late. It was not made in the supreme court nor in the trial court, where amendments could have been made even if necessary under the liberal system of criminal plead\u00ading authorized by paragraphs 6, 8, 9, and 10 of the Appen\u00addix to the Penal Code of the Philippine Islands.<br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 <\/li>\u00a0 <li> Pico was sentenced by the supreme court to seventeen years four months and one day of <em>cadena temporal<\/em>, to the accessories provided by law, and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased by the payment of 1,000 pesos. In the record there is an assignment of error that this was cruel and unusual punishment (Weems <em>vs.<\/em> United States, 217 U. S., 349; 54 L. ed., 793; 30 Sup. Ct. Rep., 544; 19 Ann. Cas., 705) ; but on the argument the contention was abandoned in open court, and the point will therefore not be considered. In other assignments complaint was made that Pico was deprived of his liberty without due process of law\u2014because the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Chinaman died as a result of the blows inflicted by Pico; because the supreme court refused to pass upon the credibility of witnesses in the trial court; because he was refused a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence; and because one of the witnesses admitted to have given false testimony. We find no error of law. The evidence fully sustained the conviction, and the judgment is affirmed. <br\/><\/li><\/ol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <em>Affirmed<\/em>.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br\/><hr align=\"LEFT\" noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> 228 U.S., 225; 57 L. ed., 812. <\/div>",

Rep., 45<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>) the foreclosure of the mortgage was decreed against the property to satisfy the principal amount and interest thereon for <i>two years<\/i> at 6 per cent, but without personal liability on the part of the defendant to pay any deficiency judgment.\u00a0 On the 24th of December, 1910, and before the sale under the foreclosure, Obras Pias sold and transferred to the plaintiff all of its right, title, and interest in and to said mortgage and in and to the judgment of foreclosure already referred\u00a0 to.\u00a0 On January 31, 1911, and in due course, the property was sold, pursuant to such judgment of foreclosure, and brought a sum sufficient to pay the <i>mortgage debt<\/i> and the <i>two years'<\/i> interest, after deducting all costs and expenses.\u00a0 On May 30, 1911, the plaintiff, standing in the shoes of Obras Pias, commenced this action against Carmen de la Cavada and her husband to collect the deficiency between the amount due upon the mortgage and the amount realized by the foreclosure sale.<br\/><br\/>So far as appears from the record the amount received from the property on foreclosure sale, less costs and expenses of foreclosure, was the same sum which was found due to the plaintiff in the foreclosure action, namely, P5,600, P5,000 being of principal and P600 being of interest.\u00a0 It was found upon the action of foreclosure when the case was appealed to this court that the defendants, being third persons within the mortgage law, were not responsible for interest upon the principal except for the two years immediately prior to the time the action was commenced.\u00a0 This, then, is an action to recover interest only, being the interest on the mortgage debt from 1881 down to the beginning of the two years for which interest was allowed in the foreclosure action.\u00a0 Plaintiff himself states the nature of the action as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"In seeking for the true rule of prescription in the present case, no confusion ought to arise from the fact that the principal of this mortgage debt has been otherwise collected and that this is, therefore, an action to collect the interest alone.\"<\/blockquote>We have, then, in this action the unusual spectacle of an attempt to collect interest upon a sum, which sum with a part of the interest due thereon has already been collected in another action.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Sunico <i>vs<\/i>. Ramirez (14 Phil. Rep., 500) the court had before it the question whether or not an action to foreclose a mortgage was maintainable after the action to recover\u00a0 the mortgage debt had prescribed.\u00a0 It was held that the action to recover the mortgage debt prescribed fifteen years from the time when it accrued, the court saying (p. 503):<br\/><blockquote>\"But whatever may have been the true origin of the indebtedness, we\u00a0 do not deem it necessary to discuss this particular contention at length, because it is clear from an examination of the facts as above set out that a strictly personal action to recover the amount of the acknowledged indebtedness would have prescribed prior to the\u00a0 date of the filing of the complaint, not only by the lapse of the comparatively short period of prescription established in the Mercantile Code, granting that the transaction out of which the debt or obligation arose was a mercantile transaction and governed by the provisions of the Mercantile Code, but also from the lapse of the fifteen-year period of prescription established in the Civil Code, assuming that it was a simple loan (<i>prestamo mutuo<\/i>) governed by the provisions of that code.\u00a0 (Arts. 1964 and 1939, Civil Code.)\u00a0 So that, for the purposes of this decision, it is not important whether the original indebtedness arose as a result of a transaction governed by the Mercantile or the Civil Code, the real question being, first, whether recourse could be had to the '<i>accion hipotecaria'<\/i> (real action to foreclose a lien or mortgage) notwithstanding the fact that the personal action to recover the indebtedness had prescribed at the time when the <i>'accion hipotecaria'<\/i> was instituted; and, second, whether that action itself (the <i>'accion hipotecaria'<\/i>) had also\u00a0 prescribed at that time.\"<br\/><\/blockquote>In determining the question in the case at bar whether the action to recover the mortgage debt had prescribed the trial court says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The fifteen years since December, 1889, when the Civil Code went into effect, having expired on the 23d of December, 1905, the date on which the Obras Pias began its action against Eugenio Lichauco and Felisarda de Vera Ignacio for the recovery of the mortgage debt, all of the time required by article 1964 has transpired for the prescription of the personal action, namely, fifteen years.\u00a0 The court has computed the time from the 1st day of December, 1889, the date on which the code went into effect in these Islands, until the 23d day of December, 1905, the date\u00a0 on which complaint was presented by the Obras Pias, because in its judgment the manifestation made by Carmen de la Cavada in the deed of sale to Ramon de Baldes y Salvador of the 11th of March, 1902, which manifestation referred to the mortgage upon the land in favor of Obras Pias and indicated that said mortgage had disappeared and been destroyed or extinguished by prescription, cannot be considered as a recognition of the debt sufficient to interrupt the time for the prescription of an action.\"<\/blockquote>Continuing the court said: <blockquote> \"The conclusions having been reached that article 1964 of the Civil Code is applicable to the present case and that the period of prescription had not been interrupted except upon the date on which the Obras Pias presented its complaint, it is undeniable that the action in the present case has prescribed, particularly the annual interest corresponding to the years from the 30th of May, 1881, to the 23d of December, 1890, these years being prior to the fifteen-year period which began on the 23d of December, 1890, and continued until the 23d of December, 1905, on which date the complaint\u00a0 was presented.\u00a0 The defendants, Carmen de la Cavada and Francisco Enriquez, are therefore obliged to pay to the\u00a0 plaintiffs in this action the interest\u00a0 on said sum from the 23d day of December, 1890, until the 30th day of January, 1909, inasmuch as the land\u00a0 was sold by the sheriff on the 31st day of January, 1911, and only so much of the interest was paid as was included in the last two years prior to such sale, or from the 31st day of January, 1909, to the 31st day of January, 1911.\"<\/blockquote>The finding of the trial court with reference to the prescription\u00a0 of the action to recover the mortgage debt is correct.\u00a0 That that action expired fifteen years after the month of December, 1889, when the Civil Code went into effect in these Islands, is beyond question at this time.\u00a0 (Sunico <i>vs<\/i>. Ramirez, above.)\u00a0 The trial court, however, does not carry its finding in this regard to its logical conclusion; for, although he concludes that the action to recover the mortgage debt had prescribed some time prior to the beginning of the action thereon, he still finds, nevertheless, that the action for the recovery of <i>interest<\/i> had not prescribed but that it could be maintained to recover the interest from 1890 down to the present.<br\/><br\/>It must be remembered that there is no provision in the original mortgage as to when the interest shall be paid and there is no proof in the record that the interest was actually paid at,stated times or that the interest paid by Antonio Enriquez up to the year 1881 was paid annually or at any other stated period.\u00a0 Moreover, it should be noticed that, from the year 1881, when Carmen de la Cavada became the owner of the premises and at the same time responsible for the mortgage debt, no demand has been made upon her for the payment of the interest and no stated period has ever been agreed upon or understood to have existed for the payment\u00a0 of the interest on said debt.\u00a0 We are unable to see, therefore, how it is possible, legally, to separate the interest, or any portion thereof, from the principal itself; and we are unable to see, furthermore, why, if the action to recover the mortgage debt itself is prescribed, the action to recover the interest, under the facts and circumstances of this case, is not also prescribed.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Stewart <i>vs<\/i>. Barnes (153 U. S., 456, 462) the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is apparent, therefore, that the principal, as such, has been received by the plaintiff, and hence, to treat the action as having any object at all, we must regard it as an action for interest alone.\u00a0 Whether in the circumstances of the case, an\u00a0 action for interest can be maintained is the only question to be determined.\u00a0 In deciding this we shall not find it necessary to consider in what respect these suits against collectors\u00a0 may differ from other actions, but shall assume, for the purposes of this opinion, that they are governed by the same rules.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"In a case where a demand of damages constitutes the very ground of the action it would seem that the rule would be different.\u00a0 If,\u00a0 for instance, in\u00a0 covenant on the part of a lessee to repair a building, the lessee should prove performance, the plaintiff might\u00a0 still be entitled to have the jury pass upon the question of his damages, however small they might be, because in such a case the right to damages constitutes the right of action.\u00a0 It might then be said that, since the\u00a0 present case is an action of assumpsit, of which damages constitute, in theory, at least, the basis, the rule we have stated would not be applicable.\u00a0 But, without considering how far, in an inquiry like this, we would be prevented by the form of an, action from ascertaining its purpose, and without adverting to the fact that one of the cases just cited was an action of assumpsit, it is to be noticed that in Pennsylvania, where the suit was brought, the form of the action of assumpsit is employed not only in cases where, at the common law, it would have been appropriate, but also in cases in which the action would formerly have been in debt or covenant<br\/><br\/>\"Treating the action of assumpsit as of such extensive scope, the object sought would not only be permitted, but required to be considered if it were desired to ascertain the real nature of a case.\u00a0 In this case the bill of particulars shows that the object sought is a liquidated sum of money, with interest.\u00a0 The evidence introduced with the acquiescence of the plaintiff, and his own admission, furnished proof that the liquidated sum has been paid.\u00a0 It thus appears that the action is not one\u00a0 sounding in damages, but that the damages, or interest, is demanded simply in respect of the detention of the principal.<br\/><br\/>\"Perhaps it might not unreasonably be argued that the payment by the government, and the acceptance of the money by the plaintiff, without a demand of interest, constituted a complete settlement of his claim irrespective of the operation of the principle which we have been examining.\u00a0 But however this may be, it is evident from what has been said that the plaintiff has parted with his right of action by accepting the money which\u00a0 was withheld from him, and has at the same time given up his right to sue for the incidental damages.\u00a0 Therefore the court below was right in directing a verdict for the defendant, and the judgment of that court is <i>affirmed.<\/i>\"<\/blockquote>The principle that the interest cannot be separated from the principal sum in order to withdraw the interest from the operation of the statute of limitation, when the principal is concededly within the statute, is well illustrated by an early case (Moore <i>vs<\/i>. Fuller, 2 Jones Law (N. C), 205) decided by the supreme court of North Carolina.\u00a0 That was an action of debt upon a bond.\u00a0 The principal of the debt had been paid and at the time of payment the parties had agreed to refer the question of interest, the payment of which was refused, to arbitration.\u00a0 Upon an award made in favor of the plaintiff, defendant still refused to pay the interest and it was sought to be recovered in an action not upon the award but upon the bond.\u00a0 The supreme court said (p. 206):<br\/><blockquote>\"The general principle is that where the principal subject of a claim is extinguished by the act of the plaintiff, or of the parties, all its incidents go with it.\u00a0 Thus, in an action of ejectment, if the plaintiff, pending the suit, takes possession\u00a0 of the premises, upon the plea of the defendant or upon its\u00a0 being shown, the plaintiff will be nonsuited.\u00a0 (Johnson <i>vs<\/i>. Swain, 44\u00a0 N. C, 335.)\u00a0 So in an action of detinue, if the plaintiff takes possession of the property claimed\u00a0 he can recover no damages, for they are consequential upon the recovery of the thing sued for.\u00a0 (Morgan <i>vs<\/i>. Cone, 18\u00a0 N. C, 234.)\u00a0 This is an action of debt on a bond to recover the interest, the principal having been paid by the defendant before the bringing of the action; by that payment the bond was discharged, and by analogy to the cases referred to the plaintiff cannot recover the interest,,which is but an incident to the principal\u2014the bond.\"<\/blockquote>To the same effect is the case of Tillotson <i>vs<\/i>. Preston (3 Johns, 229).\u00a0 This was an action of assumpsit for money had and received.\u00a0 In addition to the general issue, there1 was a plea of payment of the sums mentioned in the declaration.\u00a0 To this plea of payment the plaintiff demurred especially, alleging for one ground of demurrer that the plea did not allege that the defendant had paid to the plaintiff the interest.\u00a0 The court said: <br\/><blockquote>\"The demurrer is not well taken.\u00a0 If the plaintiff has; accepted the principal, he cannot afterwards bring an action for the interest.\"<\/blockquote>The fifteen-year period expired before the action of foreclosure was begun.\u00a0 As a necessary legal consequence, under the decision of Sunico <i>vs<\/i>. Ramirez, the right to begin an independent action to recover the mortgage debt ceased to exist.\u00a0 With that right disappeared the separate right to recover the interest, for, following the principles laid down in the above cases, it is apparent that, under the facts of this case, the interest was but an incident of the principal and lived and died with it.\u00a0 When the principal ceased to exist, the interest ceased to exist with it.\u00a0 They have, under the facts disclosed in this case, no separate existence.\u00a0 If this were not so, no interest-bearing debt would ever be outlawed, for, the interest on the same could always be collected for the full period of limitation, less one day.\u00a0 In this very case, while the principal is outlawed, the fifteen year period having expired, the plaintiff notwithstanding is, in principle and almost in fact, recovering interest on said debt for fourteen years eleven months and twenty-nine days.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that the defendants in this case, those who, it is claimed, are liable to pay the mortgage debt, were not made parties to the action of foreclosure.\u00a0 While in response to the notice served by the purchaser from Carmen de la Cavada, given in pursuance of the provisions of the Civil Code requiring the vendor\u00a0 to come in and protect the interests of the vendee, the defendants in this case did appear and file an answer therein; still nothing more was done, and it appears that no notice was taken or attention paid by the cgurt or parties to such appearance and answer and no judgment was rendered for or against them.\u00a0 We are of the opinion that, in an action to foreclose a mortgage under the Code of Civil Procedure, all of the persons who are liable to pay the mortgage debt, and therefore to pay any deficiency, are necessary parties to the action.\u00a0 They have an interest in the result thereof and in all of the proceedings\u00a0 relating thereto.\u00a0 They are entitled to know when the sale takes place and to be present thereat.\u00a0 The full protection of their interests requires it. Moreover, section 256 of the Code of Civil Procedure requires a judgment to be rendered for a specified amount and an order made that the amount for which judgment is rendered be paid into court within a given time.\u00a0 Section 260 requires the rendition and entry\u00a0 of a judgment for the deficiency <i>against the defendant<\/i>, who shall be <i>personally <\/i>liable to the plaintiff, and execution may issue on said judgment at once.\u00a0 It was the evident intention to require the plaintiff to include as defendants all persons who are obligated to pay the mortgage debt.\u00a0 Such practice will prevent the necessity of two actions between the same parties, one an action to recover the principal by foreclosure and sale of the premises, the other a subsequent action to recover the deficiency.\u00a0 These provisions justify us in holding, if they do not require us to hold, that the plaintiff must make parties defendant all those who are obligated to pay the mortgage debt as well as those who own, occupy, or are in possession or control of the mortgaged premises or any part thereof.\u00a0 Multiplicity of actions is offensive to justice, and the courts always require to be joined in a single action all persons\u00a0 who\u00a0 are liable to pay the debt the recovery of which is one of the main reasons for bringing the action.<br\/><br\/>The court having found that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover upon the general ground above stated, it is unnecessary to go into the question of whether or not Francisco Enriquez should be field responsible jointly and severally with his wife.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the Court of First Instance is hereby reversed and the defendant absolved from any liability by reason of the facts alleged in the complaint, and the complaint is dismissed upon the merits, without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Hipolito Povadora, in which an injunction was issued by the clerk of the court, and the judgment of the Supreme Court.<br\/><br\/>\"THE COURT.\u00a0 The court is of the opinion that the whole record is admissible to show the existence of questions between the deceased and the father of the present defendants.<br\/><br\/>\"COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENSE.\u00a0 The defense records the basis for its objection to the presentation of these exhibits, and said objection is that it has not been here demonstrated by competent proof that the land where the crime occurred, which was the cause of the death of Pascual Neis, is the land to which these exhibits refer.<br\/><br\/>\"THE COURT.\u00a0 It is not important that it is the land; these exhibits are admitted to show that a dispute existed.\" <\/blockquote>The only satisfactory evidence in the record that it was the same land appears in the testimony of Catalino Montellano, witness for the defense and chief clerk in the municipal treasurer's office, at Tabogan, who stated that on February 27 preceding the crime, while the deceased was in the treasurer's office for the purpose of paying his taxes, witness overheard a conversation, the substance of which follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"A.\u00a0 The deceased was talking with Capt. Pedro Hortelano and Juan Urot, and the deceased showed these two gentlemen a document, which, according to him, was an injunction.\u00a0 Capt. Pedro Hortelano\u00a0 read this document after which he was asked by Pascual Neis to advise the sons of Garcia not to further molest the laborers of the deceased, who were on the land in question.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 What else did Pascual Neis say?\u2014A.\u00a0 He added that on the following Monday the sons of Captain Diloy (the elder Garcia) would again go to the land in question to disturb his laborers; then he would use the revolver he had in his belt.\u00a0 A man called Urot, who was standing near the deceased, warned him not to carry out such an intention.\" <\/blockquote>As opposed to this it must be considered that the complaint specifies the <i>sitio<\/i> of Ilijan as the scene of the crime which is not only not shown to be included within the land in dispute in the above-mentioned civil case, but is not even shown to be within the barrio of Managase, where the disputed land is located.\u00a0 Furthermore, the elder Garcia admittedly owned another parcel of land in the vicinity, his title to which was not involved in the civil case above referred to; and at the trial in this criminal case\u00a0 the said Garcia categorically denied that the land in dispute in that case was the scene of the crime.\u00a0 As a result it has not been satisfactorily shown that the place where Neis was killed was within the land from which the defendants had been ousted by order of the court.\u00a0 We are of the opinion, however, that other facts in this case render it unnecessary to establish this fact beyond question of a doubt.<br\/><br\/>The dispute over the possession of the field in the <i>sitio<\/i> of Ilijan where Neis met his death was undoubtedly the cause of the crime.\u00a0 From the record before us it cannot be ascertained who\u00a0 had\u00a0 the better right to the possession of this land.\u00a0 But from the testimony of both the prosecution and the defense it is clear beyond question of a doubt that Neis already had his tenants at work on the land when the defendants appeared, and that he was therefore in possession of it.\u00a0 Under article 446 of the Civil Code, every possessor has a right to be respected in his possession.\u00a0 Under the same article, as well as under article 348 of the same Code, the lawful owner or possessor, when unlawfully dispossessed may be restored to his possession by the laws of procedure.\u00a0 Under sections 80-88 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and their amendments, an efficacious and speedy remedy is provided for the possessor who has been dispossessed of his holdings by \"force, intimidation, threats, strategy, or stealth.\"\u00a0 Furthermore, the defendants had advance notice of the intention of Neis to continue in possession of this land, and instead of resorting to a lawful means of ousting him, they went to the land with the avowed intention of expelling their antagonist by force of arms.\u00a0 At the outset, the first of the three requisites necessary to the defense of self-defense is lacking.\u00a0 For, not only was there no unlawful aggression on the part of the deceased, but on the contrary, the defendants were themselves the aggressors.\u00a0 The law does not countenance such a resort to arms.\u00a0 The provisions of law above set forth afford ample legal remedy for the invasion of every legal right which the defendants may have or might have had in the land in question.\u00a0 These provisions of law\u00a0 were enacted for the express purpose of obviating a resort to private redress for wrongs, real or fancied, arising out of the possession and ownership of property.\u00a0 There is no place in organized society for the employment of private force in the vindication of private rights in this manner.<br\/><br\/>In the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Ramos (18 Phil. Rep., 518), one Punsalan and his two sons were taking fish from a fishpond which Punsalan claimed as his\u00a0 property.\u00a0 The three defendants appeared and ordered them to desist, stating that they had purchased the fishpond from another person whom they named.\u00a0 Punsalan and his two sons would not accede to the demands of the defendants, who thereupon suddenly and unexpectedly attacked and killed the three Punsalans.<br\/><br\/>The defendants sought to establish self-defense, which not allowed.\u00a0 The aggravating circumstance of alevosia was found to exist, and the three defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment.<br\/><br\/>The supreme court of Spain has, in numerous decisions, held that the occupation of a property right unaccompanied by some act indicating at least probable attack upon\u00a0 the person, or which creates an immediate risk of his integrity, honor, or other rights which at the moment of being attacked cannot be preserved except by force does not constitute an unlawful aggression sufficient to justify a resort to force: the decision of March 13, 1897, a case of <i>lesiones menos graves<\/i>, wherein a father discharged a shotgun at his son who was gathering beans on the former's estate;\u00a0 the case of May 20,1913, wherein the owner of an estate agreed to allow an electric light company to place one electric light pole on his premises.\u00a0 The employees of the company placed three poles thereon and the tenant of the estate under instructions from the owner proceeded to order the employees of the company to desist from their operations, and upon their refusal, discharged a revolver at one of them, inflicting a minor wound.\u00a0 In the case of July 14, 1913, the manager of an irrigation syndicate refused to allow the defendant water for irrigation purposes to which he was legally entitled, as a result of which the defendant killed him.\u00a0 In this case the qualifying circumstance of <i>alevosia<\/i> was found present.\u00a0 In the case of September 29, 1905, two boys were severely chastised by the owner of an estate for trespassing thereon and eating fruit from the trees.\u00a0 The plea of unlawful aggression raised by counsel for the defendants cannot be allowed.<br\/><br\/>The first assignment of error raises the question of how many of the defendants are guilty as principals in the commission of the crime.\u00a0 It is the theory of the prosecution that all eight of the defendants were present, as well as the elder Garcia, Felix Espinosa, and Gregorio Golbin.\u00a0 In support of this theory the prosecution introduced Aguedo Romeroso who testified that he was a tenant of Garcia and lived within shouting distance of the scene of the crime.\u00a0 He said that the eight defendants lived in the pueblo of Tabogan and arrived at a <i>camarin<\/i> belonging to the Garcias at about 5 o'clock on Sunday afternoon.\u00a0 Witness lived within 50 <i>brazas<\/i> of this <i>camarin<\/i>.\u00a0 On Monday morning about 7 o'clock all eight of the defendants, as well as the elder Garcia, Espinosa, and Golbin passed in front of his house on their way to the land where the crime was committed.\u00a0 All were armed with bolos and clubs, and as they passed his house one of them invited him to go along for the purpose of \"making war against Pascual Neis.\"<br\/><br\/>Catalino Itan testified that Neis had engaged him to work on the land in the sitio of Ilijan and that on the morning of March 3, he had just started plowing on that land and about 7 o'clock in the morning the defendants appeared and called to him to \"get out.\"\u00a0 Seeing that there were many of them and that they were all armed, he immediately ran away.\u00a0 He retired in such haste that he recognized only Leonilo, Florentino, and Mateo Garcia.<br\/><br\/>Faustino Lambajon testified that he was a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">muchacho<\/span> of the deceased and that on the morning in question his employer told him they were going to inspect some carabaos and afterwards they would inspect the fields, Neis rode a horse and witness followed on foot.\u00a0 On reaching the land where Neis met his death they found all the defendants and the elder Garcia.\u00a0 Ceferino Garcia and the elder Garcia approached them in a friendly manner while the rest were scattered about near by.\u00a0 Ceferino offered to shake hands and when Neis grasped his hand Ceferino would not let go.\u00a0 Just then the elder Garcia cried out, \"Hala!\" and immediately all the accused rushed upon Neis with their bolos and clubs, and inflicted the wounds which caused his death.\u00a0 Witness was pursued by some of the defendants but escaped.\u00a0 When some distance away he heard three revolver shots, not in rapid succession, but at intervals.\u00a0 In his preliminary investigation this witness testified that there were more than ten persons in the party that\u00a0 attacked Neis but only named Domingo and Leonilo Garcia and Marcelo Masecampo, saying he did not recognize the others; while in the court below he identified all of the defendants and also included the elder Garcia.\u00a0 He said the reason why he did not name all of the defendants and the elder Garcia in the preliminary investigation was that he was afraid of them.\u00a0 The defense attempted to make capital out of this alleged discrepancy of the testimony of this witness, but we are of the opinion that it is not under the circumstances such discrepancy as would materially affect the credibility of the witness, inasmuch as in\u00a0 that preliminary investigation he stated that there were more than ten persons in the attacking party and the rest of his story is practically the same as it was in the Court of First Instance.\u00a0 His testimony is furthermore corroborated by the other witnesses for the prosecution.<br\/><br\/>Alejo Compayan was also a tenant of the deceased who had come to that field\u00a0 that morning to do some plowing.\u00a0 He identified all the accused and stated that when he saw the accused attack Neis he hid behind his carabao and saw the whole fight.\u00a0 His testimony is substantially the same as that of Lambajon.<br\/><br\/>Severo Brion testified that he lived between Ilijan and the pueblo of Tabogan.\u00a0 He heard Domingo Garcia say, \"Now there is no influential person on this mountain in whom the people can confide, because Pascual Neis is now dead.\"\u00a0 He heard Masecampo say in reply to this remark, \"They are gathering around Neis now, who is already stretched out on the field.\"<br\/><br\/>From this testimony, it will be noted that not only the eight defendants, but Rodorico Garcia, Gregorio Golbin, and Felix Espinosa, were parties to the crime.<br\/><br\/>Domingo, Mateo, Florentino, and Leonilo Garcia admitted having killed Neis with\u00a0 their bolos and clubs.\u00a0 Their testimony is to the effect that their father informed them that Neis was going to commence working the land in dispute on Monday, and that they went up there for the purpose of preventing him from doing so.\u00a0 They slept in the camarin belonging to their father Sunday night, and Monday morning on going to the land in dispute found Neis' laborers orking there.\u00a0 They ordered these laborers to leave the field.\u00a0 Shortly thereafter Neis arrived and asked why they had interrupted the labor of his men.\u00a0 Domingo Garcia replied that it was their land.\u00a0 Neis replied that they had no right to prevent his laborers from working the land and immediately discharged his revolver at Domingo.\u00a0 The four closed in on Neis and killed him.\u00a0 During the struggle Neis discharged his revolver at them three more times.<br\/><br\/>Gregorio Golbin testified that he slept in the <i>camarin<\/i> on that Sunday night with the four brothers and accompanied them next morning as he had a piece of land about 100 <i>brazas<\/i> away from the scene of the crime.\u00a0 He was working there when he heard a revolver shot.\u00a0 He then corroborates in its essential details the story told by Domingo and his brothers.<br\/><br\/>Felix Espinosa admits going past the house of the witness Aguedo on the morning in question, but says it was only to get some water, and that he did not go past that house in company with any of the accused.\u00a0 He says he stayed in his house all the morning.\u00a0 He also states that only the four brothers above named slept in the <i>camarin<\/i> on the night preceding the crime.<br\/><br\/>Rodorico Garcia testified that\u00a0 he was in\u00a0 his house in Tabogan Sunday night and until Monday noon, attending his wife, who was sick.\u00a0 Fernando Garcia, Ceferino Garcia, Rufino Arpon, and Marcelo\u00a0 Masecampo testified that they started together for the scene of the crime early Monday morning, with the intention of being on hand to assist the four Garcias who had slept in the <i>camarin<\/i> Sunday night.\u00a0 They were very near when they met Golbin returning from the scene of the crime, and he told them that something had happened.\u00a0 Shortly thereafter the four brothers who confessed to participating in the crime arrived and asked them to go with them to the municipal authorities, which they did.<br\/><br\/>It will be noted that there is a direct conflict between the testimony for the prosecution and the testimony for the defense, as to who participated in the commission of the crime, and as to the manner of its execution.\u00a0 As to the whereabouts of the defendants Fernando and Ceferino Garcia, Rufino\u00a0 Arpon, and Marcelo Masecampo on the night preceding the crime and shortly before it was committed, we have the testimony of the witness Aguedo, who lived very close to the camarin where he says they spent the night.\u00a0 They were all seen by this witness going in the direction\u00a0 of the field where the crime was committed at 7 o'clock on Monday morning, at which time they informed him where they were going and why and invited\u00a0 him to accompany them.\u00a0 A little later they were seen by two other witnesses, Lambajon and Compayan, attacking Neis, About 9 o'clock they were seen on their way toward Tabogan by the witness Brion, who heard them discussing the death of Neis.\u00a0 Ceferino Garcia testified\u00a0 that he and Fernando, Arpon and Masecampo did not arrive at Ilijan until about 9 o'clock.\u00a0 Golbin says he met these four as he was leaving the scene of the crime to go to the camarin, which was not far away.\u00a0 From the testimony of Golbin there is no indication that he spent two hours in traversing only a part of this short distance.\u00a0 There is here a direct inconsistency in the testimony for the defendants. Either the witnesses for the prosecution or the defendants and their witnesses were testifying falsely.\u00a0 The evidence of the prosecution, made up as it is of the\u00a0 testimony\u00a0 of four witnesses who saw these defendants from distinct points of vantage, is consistent and\u00a0 convincing.\u00a0 At the times these four wit- nesses claim they saw the defendants, the latter testify they were somewhere else.\u00a0 In 'other words, these four defendants have attempted to prove an alibi.\u00a0 Their own declarations, in the face of the direct and positive testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, are not sufficient to establish the defense of an alibi with sufficient strength to raise a reasonable doubt as to their presence at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.\u00a0 The lower court, with its superior facilities for weighing the\u00a0 evidence, accepted the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution as to the presence of all the accused at the time the crime was committed, and found that an effort was being made by Domingo, Mateo, Florentine, and Leonilo Garcia to shoulder the entire responsibility for the crime in order to shield the other defendants.\u00a0 The findings of the lower court as to this point should not be disturbed.<br\/><br\/>There is furthermore a most palpable attempt on the part of the defendants to manufacture evidence in their own behalf.<br\/><br\/>Domingo, Mateo, Florentino, and Leonid Garcia, who claimed to be the only participants in the crime, each showed slight abrasions on their\u00a0 bodies, which they claimed were caused by a bullet from Neis' revolver.\u00a0 Aside from the testimony for the prosecution that Neis did not have an opportunity to use his revolver, two lieutenants of the Insular police force testified that these abrasions were not caused by bullets.\u00a0 These witnesses examined these four defendants and stated that the abrasions were mere scratches from a nail or thorn.\u00a0 A hole in the shirt of one of the brothers, which he claimed was caused by the bullet which produced the abrasion on his person, was found to be about two inches higher than the abrasion, and appeared to have been burned by a lighted cigarette.\u00a0 It must furthermore be considered as inconceivable, as stated by one of these witnesses, that Neis should have fired a shot at each of the defendants at so close range, with the same result in each case of merely grazing their bodies without inflicting any wounds, or else\u00a0 missing one or more of them entirely.\u00a0 The lower court rejected this evidence, and we fully agree with its finding in this respect.<br\/><br\/>The defendants succeeded in approaching within striking distance of the deceased by ostensibly offering to shake hands with him.\u00a0 Neis, by accepting the proffered hand of Ceferino in a friendly shake, showed that he was not suspecting in the least a violent and deadly attack by the defendants.\u00a0 The fact that he was armed with a revolver can have no bearing on the case, as he had no opportunity to use it (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Feria, 2 Phil. Rep., 54.)\u00a0 The attack having been sudden and unexpected and treacherously made constitutes the qualifying circumstance of <i>alevosia<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>It has not been satisfactorily shown that this crime was committed\u00a0 with evident premeditation.\u00a0 While it is true that the defendants went to the field for the purpose of ousting the deceased and his tenants, it is not at all clear that they intended in any event to commit murder.\u00a0 Nor can the aggravating circumstance of superior strength be considered as existing for the reason that that circumstance is embodied in the qualifying circumstance of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">alevosia<\/span>.<br\/><br\/>The circumstance of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">alevosia<\/span> qualifies the crime of the defendants\u00a0 as that of murder.\u00a0 There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, the penalty imposed is in accordance with the law.\u00a0 The judgment appealed from is therefore hereby affirmed, with costs of this instance against the defendants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

GALE, DEFENDANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The question before this court arises upon an answer to an order to show cause issued in a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Court of First Instance of the Province of Tarlac, it being contended that said answer is insufficient in law.<br\/><br\/>The answer consists of a general denial together with facts setting forth what is deemed by the pleader to be a special and complete defense to the proceeding.<br\/><br\/>In the written argument on the hearing of the demurrer the petitioners say:<br\/><blockquote>\"The answer filed by defendant in the above-entitled cause, although traversing some of the circumstantial allegations of the complaint, admits the acts of defendant sought to be reviewed herein, and is accompanied by the records referred to in the complaint.\u00a0 Plaintiffs believe that the issues of fact presented by the answer are not material and that the orders complained of are without authority of law and beyond the judicial powers of the defendant, even upon the facts as stated in the answer.\u00a0 It is therefore sought to have the case disposed of on the present demurrer without the necessity of a trial upon the facts, and both parties are especially desirous that the case be disposed of in this way because it is hoped to secure a decree which may serve as a guide and precedent in any controversy of a similar nature, rather than a mere determination of the rights and wrongs under the particular circumstances of the present case.\" <\/blockquote>The facts admitted to be true by the so-called demurrer are set forth fully in the answer of the defendant-judge, which, so far as material, is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"That some years prior to the dates mentioned in the complaint the \nProvince of Tarlac erected at its capital a provincial building, on the \nsecond floor of which was situated a sala, or court room, for the Court \nof First Instance, of the dimensions of about 18 by 35 feet, together \nwith a room reserved as an office of chamber for the judge of said \ncourt, and with another room intended for the clerk's office of said \ncourt; that the court room so provided and situated was and is not \nadequate to the needs of said court during its session, and that said \nclerk's office was not and is not adequate to the needs of the clerk of \nthe court.<br\/><br\/>\"That for some years the court room and chambers \ncontinued to be occupied by the court and judge until the latter part of\n 1910, or early part of 1911, when the complainants herein, without in \nany wise consulting with the presiding judge of said court, and without \nnotice to him, and during his absence, removed the effects of the \npresiding judge from the chamber theretofore occupied by him and gave \nand assigned said room to the occupancy of the district internal revenue\n agent, which said agent has occupied said room to the exclusion of the \npresiding judge until about the date mentioned in the complaint, when he\n was ejected therefrom by the respondent herein.<br\/><br\/>\"That at the same time the complainants herein caused to be erected transversely across the court room a louver partition some nine feet in height, which cut off from the use of the court more than one-third of the former court room, occupying the room so formed with the clerks and typewriters of the provincial governor.\u00a0 That the talking of these clerks and their visitors, and the operation of typewriting machines, made such noise and confusion as to render it impossible for the court to hear the witnesses testifying, or to hear counsel when addressing the court.\u00a0 That by reason of the reduction of the size of the court room by this partition there was no place left in the court room for the accommodation of litigants and witnesses, who were required to stand in the corridors and sit on the stairs of the building, causing noise and confusion and rendering it impossible for the court to transact its business and perform its functions.<br\/><br\/>\"That before issuing the orders for the removal of the partition in question and of the occupants of that part of the court room, and the ejectment of the\u00a0 internal-revenue agent occupying the judge's chambers, respondent requested the complainants to remove such partition and eject the persons occupying said court room and chambers, or failing in this to provide other and proper quarters for the Court of First Instance, which request was refused, the complainant Topacio stating in reply thereto, and in the presence of the complainant provincial governor, that the Province of Tarlac and its provincial board was under no obligation to furnish quarters for the Court of First Instance, and that it permitted the court to use a part of the provincial building only by courtesy.<br\/><br\/>\"That for several years the provincial board of Tarlac, and particularly as now composed, has refused to furnish, upon the requisition of the clerk of the court, the stationery, books, furniture, and other supplies necessary to conduct the business of the court, making necessary the borrowing from Insular and provincial officials of typewriter paper, stenographers' notebooks, and other stationery and supplies in ordinary use in the courts.<br\/><br\/>\"That the complainant provincial board has refused to furnish to the clerk of the court a typewriter, which is absolutely necessary for the proper transaction of business in said clerk's office, and upon one occasion, after the clerk of the court had made several requisitions, the provincial treasurer furnished a machine which had been in use some three years in the office of the provincial treasurer and was entirely worn out and unserviceable, at the same time refusing to furnish a new machine on the ground that the work of the court was of such slight importance as to render the use of a typewriter unnecessary.<br\/><br\/>\"That during the entire period prior to the dates mentioned in the complaint herein, the complainant Topacio, as acting, treasurer of the Province of Tarlac, has refused to furnish to the clerk of the court upon his requisition stamps or postage necessary to carry on the letter and telegraphic correspondence of the clerk and judge, but has required the presiding judge and clerk to submit for his, the acting treasurer's, approval all correspondence and telegrams sent by the court and clerk on official business, and only ceased this practice when ordered by the respondent to furnish to the clerk instanter the requisite supplies of postage.<br\/><br\/>\"That at the time the respondent judge issued the orders to complainants to provide the stationery, books, furniture, and supplies as set out in the complaint, the only furniture contained in the court room was an old unsightly kitchen table provided for the judge's bench, a broken swivel chair for the use of the judge, a slightly larger table of the same class and condition for the attorneys, stenographer, and clerk, five broken bentwood chairs, and three unpainted wooden benches.\u00a0 That at said time the judge had no desk, chairs, or books.\u00a0 That there was no stationery on hand for the use of the judge, clerk, and stenographer.<br\/><br\/>\"That because of the failure of the complainants to perform the duties enjoined upon them by law in providing suitable quarters and supplies for the court and court officers, it has been and is impossible for the Court of First Instance of the Province of Tarlac to properly conduct its business, and because of the conditions created by such failure the Court and judge of First Instance of said province has to a great degree lost the respect and confidence of the people of said province.<br\/><br\/>\"That during the period in which the Court of First Instance has suffered for want of proper supplies and equipment the complainants herein have appropriated and expended large sums of public moneys in unnecessary and nonessential enterprises, as, for instance, the parking and terracing of the grounds about the provincial building, the placing therein of concrete fountains and benches, concrete curbings and walls, expending in this one enterprise, as respondent is informed and believes, the sum of more than P15,000.<br\/><br\/>\"That at the time respondent issued the order requiring the provincial board to supply and equip the court there was on hand in the provincial treasury of said province, to its credit in the Insular Treasury, large sums of money not expended and not necessary to meet obligations actually incurred by the province.<br\/><br\/>\"That at the time of the issuance by respondent of the various orders of which complaint is made, and for a long period prior thereto, the complainants had failed and refused to perform the duty enjoined upon them by law in properly housing and equipping the Court of First Instance for the Province of Tarlac, and in consequence thereof there resulted serious obstruction and interference with the administration of justice by said court, and that respondent in issuing the orders complained of for the proper housing and equipping of his court acted well within the scope of his statutory and inherent powers.\" <\/blockquote>These are the orders issued by the court upon the facts and conditions set out in the answer just quoted, and herein complained of, to wit:<br\/><br\/>On the 12th of March, 1912:<br\/><blockquote>\"TO MARCOS PALENCIA,<br\/><br\/><i>\"Sheriff of the Court of First Instance, Tarlac,

this court, with the following instructions:<br\/><br\/>\"You shall not permit any official or person, outside of the officials and employees of the court, to occupy or use the court room, judge's

attached hereto.\u00a0 Failure to comply with this order will be regarded as contempt of court and penalty will be imposed accordingly.\" <\/blockquote>In response to this order the provincial board passed a resolution which the court regarded as offensive in tone.\u00a0 Whereupon the court issued an order declaring the members of said board guilty of contempt of court and imposing a fine of P200 on each member thereof.\u00a0 The persons thus fined having subsequently made an explanation satisfactory to the court the latter, on the 28th of March, 1912, entered an order remitting the fines.\u00a0 On the same day the court issued an order to Gregorio Romulo, provincial governor, and to Jose Topacio, provincial treasurer, composing the provincial board of Tarlac, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"In view of your failure to fulfill the order of this court made on the 14th day of March, 1912, relative to the furnishing of furniture, writing materials, and so forth, you are hereby ordered to appear before this court on Monday, the 1st day of April, 1912, at 8 o'clock a. m., to show cause, if any you have, why the court should not punish you for contempt for refusing to obey its order.\" <\/blockquote>We regard this later order as vacating that part of the order of March 14 which threatened to punish for contempt without giving a hearing, and that that part of said order is not before us.<br\/><br\/>The judiciary is one of the coordinate branches of the Government.\u00a0\u00a0 (Forbes <i>vs<\/i>. Chuoco Tiaco, 16 Phil. Rep., 534; United States <i>vs<\/i>. Bull, 15 Phil. Rep., 7.)\u00a0 Its preservation in its integrity and effectiveness is necessary to the present form of Government.\u00a0 This is true of the other departments also.\u00a0 One branch is, largely speaking, as necessary and important as the other.\u00a0 The three departments are not only coordinate; they are coequal and coimportant.\u00a0 While interdependent, in the sense that each is unable to perform its functions fully and adequately without the other, they are, nevertheless, in many senses independent of each other.\u00a0 That is to say, one department may not control or even interfere with another in the exercise of its particular functions.\u00a0 This, of course, is fundamental.\u00a0 That the court may declare a law passed by the legislature unconstitutional\u00a0 and void, or an act of the executive unauthorized and illegal; or that the legislature may curtail within limits the jurisdiction\u00a0 and power of the courts, or restrict, in a measure, the scope of executive action; or that the executive may, by his veto, render null and ineffective the acts of the legislature and thus\u00a0 effectually thwart the purposes of the majority, does not affect that independence.\u00a0 These are merely the checks and balances made by the people through the constitution inherent in the form of government for its preservation as an effective institution.\u00a0 In spite of these checks and balances, if not by reason of them, the fundamental departments of the government are independent of each other in the true sense of the word.\u00a0 The quality of government consists in their remaining so.<br\/><br\/>It is clear, therefore, that each department is bound to preserve its own existence if it live up to the duty imposed upon it as one of the coordinate branches of the government.\u00a0 Whatever a person or entity ought to do or must do in law, it has the power to do.\u00a0 This being true, the judiciary has the power to maintain its existence; and whatever is reasonably necessary to that end, courts may do or order done.\u00a0 But the right to live, if that is all there is of it, is a very small matter.\u00a0 The mere right to breathe does not satisfy ambition or produce results.\u00a0 Therefore, courts have not only the power to maintain their life, but they have also the power to make that existence effective for the purpose for which the judiciary was created.\u00a0 They can, by appropriate means, do all things necessary to preserve and maintain every quality needful to make the judiciary an effective institution of Government.\u00a0 Courts have, therefore, inherent power to preserve their integrity, maintain their dignity and to insure effectiveness in\u00a0 the administration of justice.\u00a0 This is clear; for, if the judiciary may be deprived of any one of its essential attributes, or if any one of them may be seriously weakened by the\u00a0 act of any person or official, then independence disappears and subordination begins.\u00a0 The\u00a0 power to interfere is the power to control, and the power to control is the power to abrogate.\u00a0 The sovereign power has given life to the judiciary and nothing less than the sovereign power can take it away or\u00a0 render it useless.\u00a0 The power to withhold from the courts\u00a0 anything really essential for the administration of justice is the power to control and ultimately to destroy the efficiency of the judiciary.\u00a0 'Courts cannot, under their duty to their creator, the sovereign power, permit themselves to be subordinated to any person or official to which their creator did not itself subordinate them.<br\/><br\/>The courts cannot permit any official to take or withhold from them anything which is vital to their functions, nor can an official, by the exercise of any judgment or discretion of his own, escape an obligation which he is under to the courts.\u00a0 The courts alone can, while the obligation continues, release him therefrom.\u00a0 If, therefore, the officials of a province are under an obligation to the Court of First Instance of that province to furnish shelter, furniture, fixtures, supplies, equipment, etc, when, in the serious and deliberate judgment of the court, they, or any of them, are necessary for the\u00a0 administration of justice, they cannot escape that obligation except by permission of the court.<br\/><br\/>Section 13 of Act No. 83 reads in part as follows :<br\/><blockquote>\"It shall be the duty of the provincial board :<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>) To provide by construction or purchase or renting suitable offices for the provincial officers, and a court house containing a room or rooms suitable for the holding of court and for offices for the court officers and a provincial jail in the municipality fixed by law as the capital of the province.\" <\/blockquote>Section 10 of the same Act provides that it shall be the duty of the provincial supervisor to purchase and furnish \"all stationery and office supplies of every character for the use of the provincial officers, the Court of First Instance and its officers.\"<br\/><br\/>Section 1 of Act No. 152 reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SECTION 1. The governor of each province, or, in case the governor has failed to qualify as officer of the court \"by giving a bond, and a sheriff of the province has been appointed, in accordance\u00a0 with section twenty-four of Act Numbered One hundred and thirty-six, providing for the organization of courts, then the sheriff of the province, shall be the legal custodian of the court-house and the public property therein, except the books, records, and papers appertaining to the offices of the clerk, in his province.<br\/><br\/>\"In the city of Manila the sheriff of the city shall be the legal custodian of the buildings occupied\u00a0 by the Supreme Court, Court of First instance, municipal courts, and court of justices of the peace, and the public property therein, except the books, records, and papers appertaining to the offices of the clerks of the courts, and shall be responsible for the preservation and care of such buildings and property.\u00a0 All expenses incident to the repair, alteration, and custody of court buildings in the provinces, and to the purchase of equipment and supplies, including necessary books and stationery, shall be borne by the several provincial treasuries.\u00a0 All expenses of the character last mentioned incurred in the city of Manila shall be paid for from the city treasury; but no expenses for either\u00a0 purpose shall be incurred without the prior authority of the provincial board in the province, or of the municipal board in the city of Manila, as the case may be.\u00a0 The\u00a0 necessary estimates for repairs, furniture, and equipment of the courthouses in the provinces shall be made by the governors or sheriffs, as the case may be; and for the city of Manila, by the sheriff thereof.<br\/><br\/>\"The estimates for the purchase of necessary stationery and books for the use of the courts and clerks shall be made by the clerks of the several courts, respectively.\" <\/blockquote>Section 13 is mandatory and imposes upon the provincial board or provincial officials, as the case may be, a duty which cannot be evaded at their pleasure.\u00a0 While the provincial board may exercise certain discretion in regulating the size of the courtroom, or the\u00a0 cost of the same, or the material of which it is constructed, and the kind and quantity of furniture which is placed therein, nevertheless, the courtroom and offices, and the furniture and fixtures therein must be of such a character as to permit the court to exercise its functions in a reasonably effective manner, and must not be such as to impede in a material degree the administration of justice.\u00a0 While the officials have discretion in these particulars, that discretion is limited and subordinate.\u00a0 When it comes in conflict with the judgment of the court it must yield, the court being the only official which, in the last analysis, may determine, under the law quoted, what is necessary for its efficiency.\u00a0 If provincial officers furnish to a court a room which, in the judgment of the court, is clearly inadequate for the purpose, and the use of which would seriously interfere with the\u00a0 orderly and dignified administration of justice, the court may refuse to accept it; and, on the refusal of the provincial board to furnish accommodations which the court considers\u00a0 adequate, the court has power to procure them, either directly by renting, or by issuing an order to the officials whose duty it is under the law to furnish them.\u00a0 The power lies with the judge, and with him alone, to determine ultimately what is really essential for the administration of justice.<br\/><br\/>Section 10, as is seen, requires the provincial officers to furnish to the court such furniture, fixtures and supplies as may be necessary for the proper administration of justice.\u00a0 The duty here specified is mandatory and cannot be evaded.\u00a0 While a certain discretion lies with the official who furnishes the articles referred to, such as deals with color, form, style, quantity, etc., that discretion is always subject to the paramount authority of the court which, as in the case of quarters, is always the final authority determining what is necessary and essential for the proper administration of justice.\u00a0 Here again, if, after reasonable notice, the articles are not furnished in sufficient quantity and at the proper time by the officials whose duty it is to furnish them, the court has power either to purchase those things directly or, by proper proceedings, to compel the officials\u00a0 to perform the duty imposed upon them by law.\u00a0 In either case the purchase price of the articles thus found necessary would be a legal charge on the province.<br\/><br\/>Section 1 of Act No. 152, providing that no such expenses \"shall be incurred without the prior authority of the provincial board' does not alter the principles herein laid down relative to the power of the courts to obtain, one way or another, the things necessary to permit the court properly to discharge its duties.\u00a0 It deals, rather, with the persons or bodies who are under the duty to furnish the things named and the procedure necessary to obtain them.\u00a0 Nor does this provision, nor any other provision of said section, sustain the argument of petitioner based thereon, namely:<br\/><blockquote>\"As in the matter of providing courthouses, the equipment of courts as to furniture, books, and the like must be lavish or meager according to the financial capacity of the province, and no one so well as the provincial board can determine what the\u00a0 province is able to afford.\u00a0 Some one must be vested with the power to decide what is proper and possible to be furnished, and the legislature has seen fit to intrust this duty to the provincial board.\u00a0 It may be urged that the legislature has acted unwisely, and that the courts should have some power to supply themselves in cases where the provincial board neglects or refuses to perform its duty.\u00a0 But this\u00a0 is an argument to be addressed to the legislature.\u00a0 The courts charged\u00a0 with applying the law cannot usurp the functions of the legislature and contravene existing law, even if they consider it unwise.\" <\/blockquote>Considering this argument, it should be noted, in the first place, that no question of the usurpation of the functions of the legislature can arise.\u00a0 In the case before us the legislature has already acted\u2014has performed its functions.\u00a0 It has expressly laid upon certain provincial officials the duty to furnish equipment for the court.\u00a0 Wherever there is a duty there is a corresponding right; and whenever a duty is laid upon an official there is another official or person who has the right to enforce the performance of the duty.\u00a0 The duty having been laid upon the provincial officials to furnish equipment for the Courts of First Instance, the court has, as matter of construction, and without using its extraordinary powers, the right to enforce the performance of that duty.\u00a0 The demand of the court that that duty be performed is not a usurpation of legislative functions; it is a confirmation of legislative functions already exercised.\u00a0 Nor is it an abrogation or modification of a legislative act.\u00a0 It is a demand that the legislative will be respected by obedience.\u00a0 The courts have not, and are not now, making any complaint against the act of the legislature referred to.\u00a0 They see no reason for objecting to it.\u00a0 The act is wise legislation.\u00a0 Far from criticizing it, the Court of First Instance of Tarlac has been, and\u00a0 is now, trying to have it enforced.<br\/><br\/>The only controversy in this case arises from the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">interpretation<\/span> put upon the act by the petitioners in this case.\u00a0 Real interpretation never usurps legislative functions nor abrogates or modifies legislative enactments.\u00a0 It ascertains the real intention of the legislature and respects that intention by requiring obedience to it.\u00a0 The gist of the controversy is the interpretation of the petitioners by which they make the statute say that the provincial officials are the only officials who have anything whatever to say as to the kind of quarters the court shall have and what shall be its equipment, and when they shall be furnished; that the judgment of those officials is, under the law, final as to what is essential for the proper administration of justice and when it must be furnished; that the judge, who, under his oath, is responsible for the administration of justice in the province, who alone can suffer personally by reason of failure to discharge his duties properly, who is the one man among all the men in the province really competent to determine what is necessary for the discharge of his duty, who is the one man who really administers justice in the province, that he shall have nothing to say as to the kind, nature, quantity or quality of the instruments with which he works or the time when they shall be furnished; that the provincial officials, none of whom need be judges, or even lawyers, all of whom may be farmers or merchants, who may never have attended a session of court in their lives, who may not have the slightest conception of what is necessary for the proper administration of justice; that these men are the ones who have sole authority to control the administration of justice in the trial courts of the Philippine Islands.\u00a0 It is an interpretation which produces such results to which the Court of First Instance of Tarlac objects and which brings this case to this court.<br\/><br\/>Is not the bare statement of the contention a sufficient reply thereto?\u00a0 It should be observed that the statute nowhere confers such right in express terms on the\u00a0 provincial officials.\u00a0 As we have seen, the statute says:\u00a0 \"It shall be the duty\" of certain officials to furnish a courthouse \"containing a room or rooms suitable for the holding of court;\" and that it shall be the duty of certain officials to purchase and furnish \"all stationery and office supplies of every character for the use of\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 the Court of First Instance and its officers.\"\u00a0 That contention is based on an inference from an interpretation of the statute.\u00a0 The defendant judge denies that such interpretation is warranted.\u00a0 We repeat, Is not the bare statement of the contention sufficient to condemn it?\u00a0 Is it not reasonable to say that the surgeon who operates should have the right to judge as to the kind of room in which he will operate, what instruments he will use, and when he will have them?\u00a0 Can it be conceived that the legislator would give to a person absolutely ignorant of medicine or surgery, wholly untaught in the necessities of a proper operating room, and the instruments and equipment necessary thereto, the sole and exclusive authority to determine the kind of room in which the operation should occur, the equipment thereof, the instruments to be used, and the time when they should be furnished?\u00a0 In the same way, although perhaps for less reason, can it be conceived that the Legislature would intend to place with the provincial board the exclusive right to determine what the Court of First Instance needs in the administration of justice and when it shall have it?<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, the defendant asserts that it is the judge who has the right to determine what he needs and when he shall have it; that under the circumstances, no one is in so good a position to decide that question as he; that, as matter of fact, no one is competent to determine, or really capable of determining it except the judge; that it should be presumed that it was the intention of the Legislature to leave the decision of a question to the person most competent to decide it; that it should be decided on the basis of knowledge and not ignorance; competency and not incompetence efficiency and not inefficiency; that the man who has the most to do should have the most to say; that the one who has the responsibility should have the privilege; that the one who manufactures should pick his materials; that the one who paints should select his colors, and the one who sculptures should choose his chisel.\u00a0 To hold a judge responsible for\u00a0 his work, to require him to meet the difficult standards of justice, and at the same time leave him to the mercy of others in almost every element which goes to make success, is to reverse the judgment of common sense.<br\/><br\/>As we have already said, it is clear that, under the statute, it is the duty of the provincial officers to furnish such quarters and equipment as are necessary for the proper discharge of the business of the court.\u00a0 This is a duty owing directly to the court itself.\u00a0 The officials named are, to the extent of that duty, officers or servants of the court.\u00a0 They are, in the\u00a0 performance of that duty, subject to its orders and commands.\u00a0 The duty having been laid upon them, they cannot substitute their judgment or discretion for the judgment and discretion of the court.\u00a0 A court in enforcing the performance of a duty acts directly.\u00a0 It is not under the necessity of having a proceeding, such as mandamus, brought by one of the officers to compel performance of such duty.\u00a0 It acts directly by order upon the party who owes the duty.\u00a0 It is the court alone who determines what that duty is, its nature, extent and the time of performance.\u00a0 All the facts and circumstances necessary to determine these thing's are necessarily within the knowledge of the court, and it is, therefore, idle to bring a proceeding the sole object of which would be to develop those very facts and circumstances.\u00a0 The only proper proceeding, therefore, necessary to the enforcement of a duty owed by the provincial officials to a Court of First Instance of a given province is that proceeding which acts directly upon the officials who owe the duty and which\u00a0 compels them to act, an order of the court requiring them to perform or to show cause why they should not.\u00a0 No action for a writ of mandamus need be brought by the judge, or by any other person in the court's behalf, to compel the fulfillment of such a duty.\u00a0 It is sufficient that an order be directed to the officials to furnish within a reasonable time those things which the court deems necessary.\u00a0 If the officials fail to comply with the order, the court may take such proceedings as shall be necessary to compel compliance and to punish for willful disobedience.\u00a0 As we have already said, the court, instead\u00a0 of proceeding to the fullest extent with this method, may, after reasonable demand on the officials to perform, itself procure the things necessary, and the expenses incurred will be a charge on the province.<br\/><br\/>The argument based on the proposition that \"as in the matter of providing courthouses, the equipment of courts as to furniture, books, and the like must be lavish or meager according to the financial capacity of the province, and no one so well as the provincial board can determine what the province is able to afford,\" is not sound.\u00a0 The Legislature having created a court in a particular province, the\u00a0 presumption is that that province is able to support that court and to furnish it everything necessary for the proper administration of justice.\u00a0 Otherwise a court would not have been instituted in that province.\u00a0 Moreover, no man worthy to hold the office of judge would ever <i>require<\/i> the furnishing of anything \"lavish\" no matter how rich the province might be.\u00a0 If the provincial officials voluntarily furnish a court room, furniture, and equipment beyond actual needs, that is a matter of their own, but a court ought not, under any circumstances, to <i>require<\/i> anything more than is reasonably necessary for the due administration of justice.\u00a0 Certainly the court did no more than it ought to have done in the case before us, and we are not to presume that it would do more than that in any other case.\u00a0 At the very least, or at the very most, there would be no more danger that the court would require more than the province could afford than that the provincial officials would furnish less than the court actually needed.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, it may well be doubted, even if we permitted ourselves to be drawn so far in meeting this argument, whether a provincial board is, in true sense, more representative of the province than the court.\u00a0 It would seem, for obvious reasons, that no one is presumed to be so well qualified as a representative of the people of the province <i>in things judicial<\/i> as the judge of the Court of First Instance; and it is apparent that there is a relation more or less intimate between the financial condition of a province and the quantity, or even quality, of judicial business.<br\/><br\/>It is further argued by counsel that \"defendant will hardly contend that the\u00a0 determination of what proportion of the provincial building shall be assigned to the court lies entirely with the judge.\"\u00a0 This is true.\u00a0 There is\u00a0 no such contention.\u00a0 But counsel is\u00a0 wrong when he says that \"the contention of defendant must be that the action of the provincial board in designating rooms for the court is irrevocable, and that space once assigned to the court cannot be retaken by the provincial board for other purposes.\"\u00a0 No such contention is made.\u00a0 The contention, which is twofold, is that (1) when the provincial board furnishes a courthouse or court room which, in the judgment of the court, is clearly inadequate for\u00a0 its needs, the court may refuse to accept it and require the board to perform its statutory duty to furnish a courthouse or court room reasonably adequate for the needs of the court; and, on failure to obtain it in this manner, the court may rent one suitable for court purposes; and that (2) when an adequate court room has once been furnished and is in the possession\u00a0 of the court, the court has power to prevent its occupation, in whole or in part, by other persons to the serious detriment\u00a0 of the court business.\u00a0 It is not asserted that the provincial board cannot assign a particular room or rooms to a Court of First Instance; nor is it claimed that an assignment of such room or rooms having once been made is irrevocable.\u00a0 The provincial board may change the court from one room to another, when such change is reasonably necessary, provided the new\u00a0 rooms are reasonably adequate for all the purposes of the court.\u00a0 Whether they are so or not is for the judge alone to determine.\u00a0 The court may refuse to be dispossessed of his old rooms\u00a0 until he has been furnished with others reasonably fit and proper for the due administration of justice.<br\/><br\/>In determining whether or not rooms and equipment are reasonably adequate, the court may consider whether they are adequate to secure its own freedom of action, and to carry on its necessary business with dignity, decorum, order, due dispatch, and convenience.\u00a0 Not only <i>may<\/i> the court consider these things, but it is its <i>duty<\/i> to do so.<br\/><br\/>We have already, to a large extent, disposed\u00a0 of counsel's contention that the Court of First Instance exceeded its jurisdiction in issuing the orders referred to.\u00a0 He says:\u00a0 \"The usual method of requiring the performance of a statutory duty by a provincial board would be by proceedings in mandamus, but the order in the present case can certainly not be justified as a writ of mandamus, being issued by the court independent of\u00a0 any regular proceeding, without a hearing, without parties, and without anything in the semblance of due process of law.\"\u00a0 As we have already intimated, where the duty to be performed is owing to the court itself, and where, therefore, the court itself is the party interested above all others, and where as a necessary result, the conditions upon which the duty must be performed are fixed, an action brought for the sole purpose of informing the court relative to those matters is a vain and useless thing.\u00a0 In a proceeding to require officials to furnish office and equipment without which the court could not properly exercise its functions, the only question to be determined is the necessity.\u00a0 That there is no money in the treasury at the moment with which to purchase the articles required, that the provincial officials consider them unnecessary, that some other judge has done without them, that the provincial officials think that the work of the court is unimportant, are considerations of no importance in the face of the fact that the articles required are an absolute necessity.\u00a0 Such considerations, or part of them, would have weight where the question was merely one of the convenience or physical comfort of the court, or the proceeding was one to compel the officials to perform their duty or one to punish for contempt.\u00a0 They have no weight whatever where the proper administration of justice requires the things demanded.\u00a0 Developing further a theme already discussed, let us put the question, \"Would the fact that there was no money in the provincial treasury be a sufficient answer by the provincial officials to the demand of the court that it be furnished a court room wherein it could give to one man or twenty men, illegally imprisoned, the\u00a0 benefits of the writ of habeas corpus?\"\u00a0 Can the provincial officials, under the guise of exercising their judgment and discretion, suspend the writ of habeas corpus?\u00a0 Can they thereby deprive the province of justice?\u00a0\u00a0 Can they, by refusing the things absolutely necessary to the administration of justice on the ground that there is no money, or that the work of the court is unimportant, or upon any ground whatever, absolutely or in effect, banish the court from the province?\u00a0 We are not permitted to assume that the Legislature intended any such result; and if it did it would be unavailing because the Legislature has no power to enact any law which will destroy the courts or seriously impair their functions.<br\/><br\/>The claim that the writ of mandamus would prevent such\u00a0 a result has no merit.\u00a0 In the first place, being an ordinary action, it would be too slow to be of value.\u00a0 In the second place, the writ would not lie.\u00a0 The writ of mandamus never issues when the official to whom the writ is to be directed has the right to exercise judgment and discretion in the performance of that duty.\u00a0 Therefore, as counsel claims, if the provincial officials may exercise judgment or discretion as to whether they shall furnish or not and as to the time when they shall furnish, the writ would be unavailing.<br\/><br\/>But in any event, whatever questions there are could be disposed of as well in proceedings initiated by an order to show cause as in an action of mandamus; in fact, better.\u00a0 Courts, as we have said, act directly upon parties who owe them duties.\u00a0 Duties are always legal things, the nature, extent, necessity, and performance of which are usually questions of law.\u00a0 The court does not, as a rule, have to be informed of them; and, if he does, it is of such a nature that the information can better be obtained by the direct proceeding by the court than by the roundabout method of an action of mandamus.\u00a0 Besides, as a rule, officials upon whom are imposed duties and obligations in favor of the court become thereby to that extent servants of the court, to whom the court can issue its orders and commands substantially as to other servants and officials.<br\/><br\/>From these obligations it is clear that the court, in the case before us, had power to remove the partition placed in the court room during the absence of the presiding judge and to exclude all persons therefrom who were in any way interfering with the administration of justice.\u00a0 It had power, likewise, to expel from the private offices of the court and of the clerk such persons as were interlopers therein.\u00a0 Having the right of expulsion, the court had the right to continue the exclusion and prevent the reoccupation of the court room by the persons who had been expelled.\u00a0 One of the most evident powers of the court, and one the exercise of which is most patently necessary, is that of preserving order in and about the court room and of preventing such noises or other interruptions as interfere with court procedure.\u00a0 The presence of the persons on the other side of the partition, with the noises which they produced and the disorder which accompanied their work was, under the facts before us, intolerable.\u00a0 It is not only the right but it is the duty of the court to suppress all disorders and prevent all interruptions which menace the administration of the law.<br\/><br\/>It is also clear that the erection of the partition cutting off substantially\u00a0 one-third of the space formerly allotted to the court, thereby reducing the space of the court room to limitations which prevented the proper discharge of the' duties of the court, was an illegal invasion of the precincts of the court, entirely indefensible, and the reoccupation of the court and the measures adopted to that end were within its authority and jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>From the reasons heretofore given it is also clear that the other\u00a0 orders of the Court of First Instance which are before us in the proceeding were within\u00a0 the power of the court to make.\u00a0 The refusal of the officials to furnish the materials and equipment ordered by the court, and there is no claim here that they were not reasonably necessary or convenient, was properly made the basis of a proceeding by the court to determine whether there was sufficient justification for such refusal, and to enforce the order if there was none.\u00a0 The court had a right to make the order and, as a necessary result, the consequent right to enforce it, as reasonable discretion and judgment determined necessary, following the procedure established by law and custom.<br\/><br\/>The petition for the writ is denied.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that immediately adjoining the court room, and separated therefrom by a partition, was a room occupied by the recorder of the province and the clerical force of the provincial governor and the provincial board, hereinafter referred to as the recorder's room; that the court room and the recorder's room above referred to had been duly assigned to their said respective uses by the\u00a0 provincial board of Tarlac more than a year prior to the said 11th day of March, 1912, and had been devoted to their respective uses during such period; that on the said 11th day of March, 1912, defendant required in\u00a0 writing of the provincial governor of Tarlac that the room hereinbefore referred to as the recorder's room be forthwith vacated and delivered to defendant for the use of the court; that the\u00a0 provincial governor, on the 12th day of March, 1912, by authority and direction of the provincial board, replied to the\u00a0 aforesaid request of defendant, refusing to comply therewith; that thereafter, and on the 12th day of March, defendant prepared, signed, and delivered to the sheriff of the Province of Tarlac the order a copy of which, marked Exhibit A, is hereto attached and made a part of this complaint; that the partition, or 'biombo,' referred to in said Exhibit A was, in fact, the partition separating the court room from the recorder's room; that\u00a0 thereafter, in compliance\u00a0 with the aforesaid order Exhibit A, the sheriff, at midday on the 12th day of March, 1912, against the protest and objections of plaintiffs, removed the aforesaid partition or 'biombo,' and removed from the aforesaid recorder's room the equipment and personnel which had theretofore occupied it, and thereby included in the court room the space formerly occupied by the recorder's room; that plaintiffs have at no time been given or offered a hearing in the matters above set forth, and that all action taken therein by\u00a0 defendant has been <i>ex parte<\/i> and of his own motion; that plaintiffs are restrained by threats and force from reestablishing the aforesaid partition and from exercising their authority over so much of the provincial building of Tarlac as defendant chooses to consider necessary or convenient for court purposes, and that defendant, on the 17th day of April, 1912, has signed and issued the order a copy of which is hereto attached, marked Exhibit B, and made a part hereof, and that defendant intends and has threatened to enforce his aforesaid orders by means of contempt proceedings against the plaintiffs Romulo and Topacio, and by other means, unless said orders are annulled by this honorable court.<br\/><br\/>\"That defendant, on the 14th day of March, 1912, ex parte and on his own motion, signed, issued, and delivered to plaintiffs the order a copy of which, marked Exhibit C, is hereto attached and made a part of this complaint; that the provincial board of Tarlac, at the time of the aforesaid order, was without appropriable funds available for the supply of books and equipment to the Court of First Instance except in the sum of P1.64, and that there was available, of funds already appropriated and applicable under the law to supplying equipment for the Court of First Instance, only the sum of P278.60; that the articles required by defendant in his aforesaid order Exhibit C are of the aggregate value of more than P1,000; that plaintiffs, even if they had funds available for the\u00a0 purpose, could not in any event have supplied the articles referred to in Exhibit C within the time therein fixed, that is to say, on or before the 23d day of March, 1912; that plaintiffs, on the 16th day of March, 1912, by an appropriate resolution of the provincial board, replied to defendant that it was impossible to comply with his order Exhibit C, a copy of which resolution, marked Exhibit D, is hereto attached and made a part of this complaint;\u00a0 that plaintiffs thereupon, and by appropriate resolution, expressed to defendant their lack of intention to threaten or commit contempt, whereupon defendant signed and issued the order a copy of which, marked Exhibit F, is hereto attached and made a part of this complaint; that plaintiffs have furnished to defendant some of the articles referred to in Exhibit C, and have not furnished the balance nor have they been able to do so; that defendant, on the 28th day of March, 1912, signed and issued the order a copy of which is hereto attached, marked Exhibit G, and hereby made a part of this complaint; that defendant intends and has threatened to punish the individual plaintiffs by the imposition of penalties for contempt of court upon the termination of these proceedings before the Supreme Court, unless defendant's orders herein referred to are annulled or defendant is forbidden by this court so to proceed.\"<br\/><br\/>The defendant's answer is set out in full in the majority opinion.\u00a0 On November 20, 1912, the plaintiffs appeared and filed the following demurrer to the answer:\u00a0 \"The plaintiffs appear and interpose a demurrer against the answer presented by the defendant upon the following ground, to wit:\u00a0 That said answer does not set forth facts sufficient to constitute a defense or counterclaim.\" <\/blockquote>On March 3, 1913, the following stipulation was filed:<br\/><blockquote>\"The parties to the above entitled cause, by their respective undersigned attorneys, hereby stipulate that, with the consent of the court, the demurrer interposed by plaintiffs to the answer of the defendant shall be heard on Monday, March 10, 1913, at 9 o'clock a. m., or as soon thereafter as the court may be able to hear counsel.\" <\/blockquote>The court says:\u00a0 \"The question\u00a0 before this\u00a0 court arises upon an answer to an order to show cause\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 In the written argument\u00a0 on the <i>hearing\u00a0 of the demurrer<\/i> *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The facts admitted to be true by the so-called demurrer\u00a0 are set forth fully in the answer of the defendant\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.\"<br\/><br\/>But later the court appears to hold that the demurrer admits that the allegations in the answer are true\u00a0 not only for the purpose of determining whether or not such allegations constitute a valid defense but also for the purpose of finally\u00a0 disposing of the case.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs allege that the provincial board of Tarlac, at the time the order of March 14 was issued, was without appropriable funds available for the supply of books and equipment to the Court of First Instance except in the sum of P1.64, and that there was available of funds already appropriated and\u00a0 applicable under the law to supplying equipment for the Court of First Instance only the sum of P278.60 and that the articles called for in said order were of the aggregate value of more than P1,000.\u00a0 The defendant in his answer says that at the time he issued the order requiring the board to supply and equip the court there was on hand in the provincial treasury large sums of money not expended and not necessary to meet obligations actually incurred by the province.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the fact that neither party presented any testimony in support of these allegations the court has accepted those of the defendant as true.<br\/><br\/>Again, the defendant alleges in his answer that for several years the provincial board of Tarlac, and particularly these plaintiffs,\u00a0 have refused to furnish upon the requisition of the clerk of the court the supplies necessary to conduct the business of the court; that the provincial treasurer furnished the court with an old secondhand typewriter which had been used about three years and refused to furnish a good machine on the ground that the work of the court was of such slight importance as to render the use of the typewriter unnecessary; that said treasurer has refused to furnish stamps necessary to the carrying on of the correspondence of the clerk and judge; that during the time the court has suffered from want of proper supplies the plaintiffs have appropriated and expended large sums of public moneys unnecessarily; and that the plaintiffs have failed and refused to perform the duty enjoined upon them by law.\u00a0 These are very serious allegations against the plaintiffs.\u00a0 They have not had an opportunity to deny these charges, nor to prove the contrary.\u00a0 They can truthfully say that they have never had a hearing in this court or in the court below.<br\/><br\/>I consider that the principal question in this case is whether or not the respondent judge exceeded his power or jurisdiction in issuing the order of March 14, 1912, and in proceeding to punish the parties by fine and imprisonment for a failure to obey said order.<br\/><br\/>The court says:\u00a0 \"These are the orders issued by the court upon the facts and conditions set out in the answer just quoted, and herein complained of, to wit:\"<br\/><br\/>The court then sets out the orders of March 12, March 14, March 17, and March 28, and says:\u00a0 \"We regard this latter (that of March 28) as vacating that part of the order of March 14 which threatened to punish for contempt without giving a hearing, and that that part of said order is not before us.\"<br\/><br\/>Again the court says: \"The refusal of the officials to furnish the\u00a0 materials and equipment ordered by the court, and there is no claim here that they were not reasonably necessary or convenient, was properly made the basis of a proceeding by the court to determine whether there was sufficient justification for such refusal, and to enforce the order if there was none.\"<br\/><br\/>And again the court says:\u00a0 \"Such considerations (that there was no money in the treasury to pay for the articles) or a part of them, would have weight where the question was one of the convenience or the physical comfort of the court or the proceeding was one to compel the officials to perform their duty or one to punish for contempt.\u00a0 They have no weight whatever where the proper administration of justice requires the things demanded.\"<br\/><br\/>The court admits that the order of March 14 is one of those complained of and holds that the respondent judge did not exceed his jurisdiction in issuing\u00a0 that order.\u00a0 The court also admits that the fact that the plaintiffs\u00a0 had no money with which to buy the materials and supplies would have great weight where the proceeding was one to compel the officials to perform their duty or one to punish for contempt.\u00a0 The proceedings instituted by the order of March 28 is certainly one to punish the plaintiffs for\u00a0 contempt.\u00a0 The order itself establishes beyond question this fact.\u00a0 The contempt proceedings were suspended because this action was instituted in the Supreme Court.\u00a0 But the plaintiffs allege that the defendant intends and has threatened to punish the individual plaintiffs by the imposition of penalties for contempt of court upon the termination of these proceedings before the Supreme Court, unless defendant's orders herein referred to are annulled or defendant is forbidden by this court so to proceed.\u00a0 As this court has denied the writ the plaintiffs are in the same position as they were before instituting this action and are now subject according to their allegations, and these allegations are not denied, to be punished for failure to obey the order of March 14.<br\/><br\/>This court has, as I have indicated, accepted as true the allegations set forth in the defendant's answer.\u00a0 This has been done on a hearing upon a demurrer to the answer.\u00a0 There can be no question about this proposition as the court says:\u00a0 \"These are the orders issued by the court upon the <i>fact and conditions set out in the answer just quoted<\/i>.\"\u00a0 This is the first case upon record where this procedure has been followed.<br\/><br\/>The court has held and announced as the law in this jurisdiction:\u00a0 (1) That judges of the Courts of First Instance have the power to peremptorily order provincial boards to furnish just such materials and supplies as the judge may consider necessary for the proper dispatch of the business of the court, and to punish by fine and imprisonment for the failure to comply with such an order, notwithstanding the fact that the board is without funds to pay for such materials and supplies; and (2) that provincial boards are not competent to determine the needs of the Courts of First Instance, the judge being the only person who can determine this question.\u00a0 It will be noted that there is not a single authority cited in the majority opinion in support of these propositions.<br\/><br\/>To the answer of the board that it had no money it has been said that the board could have purchased the materials on credit.\u00a0 With the general proposition that the provincial board is required to furnish the court with equipment and supplies necessary for the proper conduct of its business I agree, but the issuance of the order of March 14 and the punishment for contempt should be preceded by request upon the provincial board to meet the court's requirements in the manner provided by law.<br\/><br\/>Section 1 of Act No. 152, quoted in the majority opinion, is explicit in requiring that estimates of what a court deems necessary for the proper conduct of its business be submitted to the provincial board by the sheriff or clerk as the case may be.\u00a0 Such estimates are easily and quickly prepared, and aside from the controlling1 fact that the law plainly requires such procedure it is no more than fair to the board.\u00a0 Even from the allegations in the answer of the respondent judge the necessity of the court does not appear to have been so pressing as to justify an absolute disregard of the procedure established by law for securing supplies.\u00a0 The holding, as set forth in the majority opinion, to the effect that the board is not competent to determine the needs of the court is not justified by\u00a0 the law.\u00a0 The equipment and the supplies needed by the court are of precisely the same nature as those required for the use of provincial officials.\u00a0 The board is in charge of the provincial funds and is best capable of knowing the amount which should be allowed for the maintenance of the different offices.\u00a0 From absolute necessities to what may be desired by individual officers is a long step.\u00a0 To assert, as this court has done, that each judge who comes along has access to the provincial funds to the extent of fitting up his office to suit his individual taste, is going too far.\u00a0 The board should be allowed to fulfill its duty imposed by law of providing and fitting up the court's apartments as in its judgment the needs of the service require and the funds of the province will stand.\u00a0 Even were the requirements of the court in the way of equipment and supplies of so intricate and complicated a nature that they were beyond the\u00a0 ken of the provincial board, that fact alone would not necessarily make the court the last authority on what was necessary as distinguished from what might be convenient.\u00a0 That\u00a0 there is room for friction between provincial boards and the various courts upon this subject is very true, yet the whole history of American jurisprudence, as well as our own comparatively limited experience, demonstrates that the executive officials have always been intrusted with the duty of providing the judicial department with equipment and supplies and have discharged this duty satisfactorily except in a very few cases.\u00a0 To say in the face of this fact that what a court deems necessary must be furnished, is going farther than necessary.\u00a0 That a court is not infallible upon these matters may be inferred from a few reported cases where the judge overstepped his authority in these matters.\u00a0 (Los Angeles Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Superior Ct., 93 Cal., 380; County of San Joaquin <i>vs<\/i>. Budd, 96 Cal., 47; Barnett <i>vs<\/i>. Ashmore, 5 Wash., 163; State <i>ex rel. vs<\/i>. Smith, 82 Mo., 51; Board <i>vs<\/i>. Gwin, 136 Ind., 562.)<br\/><br\/>The majority opinion lays down the rule that instead of proceeding against the provincial board for contempt, the court \"may, after reasonable demand on the officials to perform, itself procure the thing necessary and the expense incurred will be a charge on the province.\"\u00a0 But the law says, and it is\u00a0 quoted in the majority opinion, that, \"no expense for either purpose shall be incurred without the prior authority of the provincial board\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"\u00a0 This plain and mandatory provision of law has been disregarded by this court and judges of first instance are now authorized, not by the legislature, but by the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, to enter a field heretofore solely and exclusively occupied by the provincial board.<br\/><br\/>In a case where the law was practically the same as that which must govern the present case, in that the county commissioners were alone intrusted with the expenditure of county funds and with the property of the county, its repair, equipment, and the furnishing of office supplies, and the county court purchased a strip of matting for the floor of the court room, which it was agreed \"was indispensable to the comfort and convenience of those having\u00a0 business to transact in said court,\" the appellate court held (Commrs. of Neosho Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Stoddart, 13 Kan., 157):<br\/><blockquote>\"Indeed, every law upon the statute book that has any reference to the subject would seem to indicate that the county board has exclusive control, within the law, of all county expenditures; and there is no law upon the statute book that authorizes either the district court, or the sheriff, or both together, to contract for the county, or to create any indebtedness against the county, in any case similar to the one now under consideration.\u00a0 The county commissioners alone possess such power, and they alone can create such indebtedness.\u00a0 It is the duty of the county commissioners, and their duty alone, to furnish a suitable court room for their county; <i>but if they do not do so, then some other remedy than the one resorted to in this case must be invoked<\/i>.\" <\/blockquote>As said in the case last cited and applying1 the principle to the case under consideration every law that has any reference to the expenditure of provincial funds shows that provincial boards have exclusive control of all provincial expenditures; and there is no law that even indicates that Courts of First Instance have any control whatever over the public moneys or can force an expenditure which is not authorized by the board.\u00a0 It is true that it is the duty of the board to furnish the necessary materials and supplies for the\u00a0 courts, but what is necessary should be left,\u00a0 in the first instance, to the judgment of the board as the members thereof are in a position to know the needs of officials and the financial condition of the province; but if the board refused to furnish the court with the necessary supplies after the proper estimate has been submitted and they have been given an opportunity to act thereon, it would seem that it would be more appropriate and orderly to compel the board to act by means of a mandamus than to peremptorily order the expenditure of funds without giving the board an opportunity to be heard or for the judge to purchase the supplies himself and charge the same to the province.\u00a0 There is never any danger to the public service in following the course marked out by the law in these matters.<br\/><br\/>In the majority opinion the court says:\u00a0 \"The judiciary is one of the coordinate branches of the Government.\u00a0 Its preservation in its integrity and effectivness is necessary to the present form of Government.\u00a0 This is true of the other departments also.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 Each department is bound to preserve its own existence if it live up to the duty imposed upon it as one of the coordinate branches of the Government *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\u00a0 Courts cannot, under their duty to their creator, the sovereign power, permit themselves to be subordinated to any person or official to which their creator did not itself subordinate them.\"<br\/><br\/>With these propositions I fully agree.\u00a0 But the creator has said that \"no expense for either purpose shall be incurred without the prior authority of the provincial board in the province,\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"\u00a0 The respondent judge without authority from the provincial board or without even giving the provincial board an opportunity to grant the necessary authority ordered the expenditure of over P1,000 of the public funds and this court has said that he was acting within his power.\u00a0 In so doing, has the court maintained the principle that the judiciary and the executive departments are coequal?\u00a0 It seems to me that the executive department has been peremptorily subordinated to the judiciary.\u00a0 The door has been thrown wide open for friction and confusion between the judiciary and the executive department, and that harmony and orderly procedure which has so long existed between the two may now cease to exist.<br\/><br\/>The court asks these questions:\u00a0 \"Can the provincial officials, under the guise of exercising their judgment and discretion, suspend the writ of habeas corpus?\u00a0 Can they thereby deprive the province of justice?\u00a0 Can they, by refusing the things absolutely necessary to the administration of justice on the ground that there is no money, or that the work of the court is unimportant, or upon any ground whatever, absolutely or in effect, banish the court from the province?\"<br\/><br\/>In answer to these questions it is sufficient to say that the plaintiffs have never thought of suspending the writ of habeas corpus, nor depriving the province of justice, nor banishing the court from the province.\u00a0 The only thing that the plaintiffs asked is a hearing.\u00a0 They contend that if they can get a hearing in this court they can satisfactorily explain their conduct.\u00a0 They can show that they have at all times been\u00a0 ready and willing to furnish the court upon a proper requisition, with all the necessary materials and supplies, and that they never have contended that the work of the court is unimportant or that they have expended large sums of money unnecessarily or that they have failed to perform the duties imposed upon them by Jaw.\u00a0 If it be true as the court says that the fact that the province had no funds with which to buy the supplies mentioned in the order of March 14 has \"no weight whatever where the proper administration of justice requires the things demanded,\"\u00a0 I think that in view of the positive provision of law that no funds can be expended except\u00a0 upon the approval of the provincial board the plaintiffs should have at least been given a hearing upon the matter.\u00a0 These plaintiffs have been adjudged to have been incompetent, to have expended large sums of money unnecessarily, and to have failed to perform their duties, but this adjudication has been made upon the mere allegations in the answer of the defendant, and the plaintiffs, as I have said, have had no opportunity to be heard.\u00a0 To such procedure I cannot agree.<\/div>",

I., did willfully, criminally, and unlawfully, and with abuse of superior strength, wound and beat Cayetano Peralta, inflicting upon him various injuries as the result of which the said Cayetano Peralta died on December 31 of the same year; a deed committed in violation of the law.\"<br\/><br\/>The evidence of record discloses that on the morning of December 27, 1912, a dispute arose between the wife of the deceased and the wife of the defendant Domingo Rivera, over some question as to the loan of a pair of scissors and the failure to return them.\u00a0 Heated and insulting language passed between the women from the windows of their houses, which were located quite close together.\u00a0 The deceased appears to have been drawn into the wordy dispute, and as a result of an offensive remark made by him to Rivera and his wife, Rivera went down from his house into the street, and standing in front of the house of the deceased with two stones in his\u00a0 hands, challenged him to come down and prove which was the better\u00a0 man.\u00a0 The deceased when he heard this challenge from the street became greatly enraged, picked up a large bolo, rushed out of his house and advanced on Rivera, who, being a much smaller man\u00a0 and seeing his adversary approaching him with a large bolo in his hand, took to\u00a0 flight.\u00a0 The deceased pursued him and inflicted upon him two wounds, one in the back and one in the side.\u00a0 Rivera ran into the lot of one of the neighbors and finding himself stopped by a fence, turned and endeavored to defend himself from the onslaught of the deceased with a small knife or bolo.\u00a0 At that moment the father of Rivera (his coaccused Antonio Rivera) and Canuto Batoon\u00a0 (the other coaccused) rushed to his assistance.\u00a0 The father with a blow of a heavy piece of cane succeeded in disarming the deceased and at the same moment Batoon leaped upon him from behind and caught him around the waist.\u00a0 In the melee, which\u00a0 only lasted a second or two, the accused Domingo Rivera inflicted three wounds upon the deceased, two in the arms and one in the abdomen.\u00a0 The parties were separated almost immediately and the wounded man was carried to the municipal building, where he died four days thereafter.\u00a0 Domingo\u00a0 Rivera, who inflicted the fatal wounds gave himself up to the local authorities, claiming that what he had done had been done in self-defense.\u00a0 The deceased, in his ante-mortem statement, charged Domingo Rivera with having inflicted the fatal blow, and Antonio Rivera and Batoon with having joined in the assault by disarming and holding him while the fight was in progress.<br\/><br\/>There is considerable conflict in the testimony of the witnesses called at the trial.\u00a0 The story told by the widow of the deceased, who claimed to have seen all that occurred from the window of her house, was substantially as above related, except that she asserted that when her husband went down-stairs with a bolo in his hand Domingo Rivera met him in the street and with his bolo inflicted two wounds in his arms; that her husband then took to flight and ran away from Rivera until he was stopped by the fence in the neighbor's yard, where the fatal blow was struck, all three\u00a0 of the accused there joining in the attack.<br\/><br\/>For an examination of all the evidence of record as well as from a consideration of the inherent improbability of this story, we are well satisfied that the widow of the deceased deliberately inverted the facts with the intention of increasing the criminal liability of the accused.<br\/><br\/>It is fully and conclusively established that when Domingo Rivera stood in the street challenging her husband to come down and prove which was the better man, he had two stones in his hands, and it may fairly be inferred from this fact that at that moment he was not armed with a bolo.\u00a0 The bolo with which the fatal wound was inflicted was produced at the trial in the court below and was shown to be, by comparison with the bolo used by the deceased, a relatively small weapon, referred to indifferently by the witnesses as a knife or a bolo (<i>cuchillo o bolo<\/i>).\u00a0 It does not appear clearly from the record just where or when Domingo Rivera secured this bolo, but it seems clear that it must either have been handed to him by some person after the accused had rushed upon him and put him to flight, or that he drew it from its sheath while he was endeavoring to make his escape.\u00a0 The deceased was shown to be a much larger and more powerful man than his adversary, and it would seem to be contrary to the inherent probabilities of the situation to hold that the smaller man, unarmed or at most armed with a very short small bolo, would succeed in putting1 to flight his adversary, who by the widow's own statement rushed down from the house to the attack with a large and dangerous bolo in his hand.\u00a0 Moreover the wounds in the back of Domingo Rivera almost conclusively corroborate his story and the story of various witnesses who testified that they saw him endeavoring to make his escape from the deceased.<br\/><br\/>The accused themselves undertook at the trial to relieve themselves of all criminal responsibility:\u00a0 Domingo Rivera insisting that he struck the fatal blow in self-defense at the moment when the deceased had left himself open to the attack by a slip as he approached the fenced place where he (Rivera) turned to await him; and the other two accused insisting that they did not come up to the party until a few moments after the fight took place, and that they intervened only to help to carry away the wounded man.\u00a0 Their account of the fight at the fence is in our opinion completely disproven\u00a0 by the testimony of the witnesses called for both the prosecution and the defense, and we are satisfied that in declining to tell the truth as to all that occurred, Rivera and Batoon were actuated by the fear that if they admitted that they had taken an active part in the fight they might be punished on the charge of unlawfully\u00a0 killing the deceased.<br\/><br\/>The trial judge accepted the story as told by the widow and, erroneously as we are convinced, convicted all three defendants of the crime of homicide.\u00a0 As to the accused Antonio Rivera (the father of Domingo, who inflicted the fatal wound) and Canuto Batoon, we think that they were clearly entitled to acquittal on the ground that their intervention in the affray was actuated solely by a desire to save their kinsman and friend from imminent danger of death at the hands of his much stronger and better-armed adversary.\u00a0 It seems quite clear that in striking the bolo from the hands of the deceased and grasping him around the waist, they did no more than the manifest necessities of the occasion demanded, and that under all the circumstances they cannot be held criminally liable for their intervention on his behalf.\u00a0 It is not contended that they took any part in the original dispute which resulted in the fatal affray, nor that they were actuated by revenge, resentment or any other evil motive.\u00a0 Article 8 of the Penal Code provides that:<br\/><br\/>\"The following are exempt from criminal liability:<br\/><blockquote><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"4.

Anyone who acts in defense of the person or rights of a stranger, provided that the first and second circumstances mentioned in paragraph four are present, and the further circumstance that the person defending be not actuated by revenge, resentment, or other evil motive.\"<\/blockquote>As to the accused Domingo Rivera, we are of opinion that in view of the provocation given by him to the deceased he cannot be said to have established his claim of absolute exemption from criminal liability on the ground that the killing of the deceased was done in lawful self-defense.\u00a0 The evidence of record leaves no room\u00a0 for doubt that he provoked the quarrel which resulted in the death of his adversary.<br\/><br\/>Article 86 of the Penal Code provides as follows:\u00a0 \"A penalty lower by one or two degrees than that prescribed by law shall be imposed if the deed were not wholly excusable by reason of the lack of some of the conditions required for exemption from criminal liability in the several cases mentioned in article 8, provided that the majority thereof be present.\u00a0 The courts shall impose the penalty in the degree which may be deemed proper, in view of the number and weight of the conditions of exemption present or lacking.\"<br\/><br\/>Under all the circumstances of this case we are of opinion that the appellant Domingo Rivera, although guilty of the crime of homicide, should be given the benefit\u00a0 of the provisions of this article, it appearing that but for the fact that he himself provoked the fatal quarrel, he would be exempt from all criminal liability, on the ground that he struck the fatal blow, in self-defense.\u00a0 The penalty which should have been imposed upon him is, therefore, the penalty lower by one degree than that prescribed\u00a0 for the crime of homicide.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial court upon all the defendants and appellants should be and is reversed.\u00a0 The appellants Antonio Rivera and Canuto Batoon should be and are acquitted of the crime with which they are charged, with their proportionate share of the costs in both instances <i>de oficio<\/i>, and they will be set at liberty forthwith.\u00a0 But the\u00a0 defendant Domingo Rivera is hereby declared to be guilty of the crime of homicide with which he was charged, modified nevertheless by the fact that the fatal blow would have been struck in lawful self-defense but\u00a0 for the fact that he himself provoked the assault of his adversary.\u00a0 He should therefore be, and he is hereby, sentenced to six years and one day of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, together with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, and to the payment of his proportionate share of the costs in both instances.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Abreu had been named by the Secretary of Finance and Justice to hold court in that province in his place, and especially to hold a term of court at Pasig, Rizal, beginning on November 20, 1913.\u00a0 The cause having been regularly brought on for trial at the term presided over by Judge Abreu, the attorneys for the plaintiff\u00a0 made the objection that, under the order of this court issued in the mandamus action, no judge other than Judge Barretto could lawfully hear and determine the cause.\u00a0 It was claimed that the order of this court having been directed to Alberto Barretto, he is the only judge who can hear and determine the cause.<br\/><br\/>Our action is invoked by a motion to clarify and render unambiguous the dispositive part of our decision and the order which we issued thereon.\u00a0 It is claimed that the ambiguity lies in the inability of the parties to determine whether or not the trial of the cause by any other judge than Alberto Barretto would be a violation of the terms thereof.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that the motion must be denied.\u00a0 There is no ambiguity in the decision or the order.\u00a0 It was directed to Alberto Barretto as Judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Rizal.\u00a0 While it was not directed to him personally but to him as\u00a0 a judge, its operation was confined entirely to him by reason of the nature of the action in which the order was issued.\u00a0 The issues framed in that action relate solely to the qualifications of Judge Barretto in his relation with the action then pending in his court.\u00a0 The defendants denied the existence of qualifications necessary to make the judge competent to sit, while the plaintiff asserted that the judge was qualified.\u00a0 We held with the plaintiff and ordered the judge to proceed with the trial of the action.<br\/><br\/>The action of mandamus in the Supreme Court, being one which affected Judge Barretto and him alone, would necessarily be subject to the possibility of having its whole purpose defeated and the decision deprived of force, or effect by the permanent removal of Judge Barretto from that province or by the substitution of another judge to perform his duties therein temporarily.\u00a0 The order we issued was the result of an action touching the qualifications of Judge Barretto in a particular action pending before him in the Province of Rizal.\u00a0 The inevitable and necessary condition upon\u00a0 which the action was founded and upon which the order therein\u00a0 was issued by this court\u00a0 was that Judge Barretto should remain judge in that province.\u00a0 If he did not remain judge of that province, the action could produce no effect and any judgment therein would be vain and useless.\u00a0 Whether he did so remain judge in that province or not was entirely beyond the control of this court and involved matters wholly outside its sphere of activity.\u00a0 If, after the issuance of our order, competent authority removed Judge Barretto from that province, whether permanently or temporarily, and substituted another judge in his place, as was actually done, the action to compel him to proceed was in vain, and this court, with all others, was robbed of power to enforce the decree therein entered.<br\/><br\/>It is a necessary conclusion, therefore, that the action referred to in this motion is cognizable by any judge who sits as judge of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Rizal, whether it be Judge Barretto or another.<br\/><br\/>While we deny the motion upon the ground that there is no ambiguity in the decision or order and no reason for a verbal modification of either, nevertheless, following the rule adopted in several cases, we have expressed an advisory opinion upon the question presented and argued in order that time may be saved and expense avoided, should the parties see fit to be guided by our conclusions.<br\/><br\/>The motion is denied.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This action was originally commenced by Miguel Malvar, husband of the said Paula Maloles and father of the other petitioners.\u00a0 After the commencement of the action and before the tiral, the said Miguel Malvar died and the present petitioners were substituted by an amendment to the petition.<br\/><br\/>The petitioners allege that they are the owners of a parcel of land located in the <i>sitio<\/i> known as Maquiling, of the <i>barrio of San Antonio<\/i>, municipality of Santo Tomas, Province of Batangas, and included within the forest reserve of Maquiling.\u00a0 The petitioners allege that the land is more particularly described as follows:\u00a0 That it is bounded on the north by the lands of Claudio Medranas, Miguel Malvar, the hacienda de Calamba, and Maximo Malvar; on the east by the lands of Maximo Malvar and Maria Tapia; on the south by the lands of Maximo Malvar, Juan Sanchez, and Miguel Malvar; and on the west by the lands of Potenciano Villegas, Tranquilino Centeno and Miguel Malvar.\u00a0 The petitioners allege that the superficial area of said tract of land\u00a0 is approximately <i>228.4296 hectares<\/i>.\u00a0 The petitioners allege that said land had been acquired them and their predecessors by a <i>composicion gratuita con el Estado<\/i>, and a portion by purchase from person whose names are given in paragraph 4 of the petition.<br\/><br\/>At the time of the presentation of the petition, the petitioners presented a plan or map of the land in question which showed that the said parcel of land contained <i>236.2618 hectares<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>On the 4th day of December, 1911, the Director of Lands, through Ignacio Villamor, Attorney-General, filed an answer opposing the registration of the lands described in the petition.<br\/><br\/>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable Norberto Romualdez, \"7udge, found that the petitioners were entitled to have the land in question registered, and so ordered.\u00a0 From that order the Director of Lands appealed and in this court alleges that the lower court committed an error in denying the opposition presented in the lower court and in decreeing and adjudging the registration\u00a0 of the land in question in favor of the petitioners.<br\/><br\/>After the presentation of the petition, the registrar of deeds of the Province of Batangas was requested to make a report upon the question whether or not the land involved in the petition had been registered in the registry of deeds of said province.\u00a0 On the 13th\u00a0 day of November, 1911, the registrar of deeds of the Province of Batangas presented a written report in which he said that <i>none of said lands described in the petition were registered in the registry of property of the Province of Batangas.<\/i><br\/><br\/>It will be remembered that the petitioners alleged that the lands in question had been obtained by a <i>composicion con el Estado<\/i> and by purchase from certain individuals whose names appear in the petition.\u00a0 No documentary proof whatever was presented by the petitioners in support of the allegation.\u00a0 The reason which was given for the failure to present said documents was the fact the they had all been lost except three.\u00a0 These three (<i>composiciones con el Estado<\/i>) are united with the record.\u00a0 Just how they got into the record is not disclosed.\u00a0 They were neither made apart of the petition nor were they presented as proof during the trial of the cause.\u00a0 However, the lower court considered them as proof in the cause and no objection is now raised against their consideration.\u00a0 We will, therefore, examine them for the purpose of ascertaining their value as proof in support of the claim of the petitioners.\u00a0 They are not marked as exhibits.\u00a0 We will, therefore, refer to them by reference to the pages on which they appear in the record.<br\/><br\/>The first (p. 10) is a <i>composicion con el Estado<\/i>, apparently issued on the 30th day of November, 1891, for a parcel of land said to contain <i>28 hectares, 10 ares<\/i> and <i>92 centiares<\/i> located in the <i>barrio of San Rafael<\/i>, pueblo of Santo Tomas;<br\/><br\/>The second (p. 14) is a <i>composicion con el Estado<\/i>, issued on the same date as the first (the 30th day of November, 1891) for a parcel of land said to contain <i>27 hectares, 15 ares<\/i> and <i>70 centiares<\/i>, located in the <i>barrio of San Rafael<\/i>, pueblo of Santo Tomas;<br\/><br\/>The third (p. 18) is a <i>composicion con el Estado<\/i>, issued on the same date (the 30th day of November, 1891) and is for a parcel of land said to contain <i>26 hectares, 19 ares<\/i> and <i>22 centiares<\/i>, also located in the <i>barrio of San Rafael<\/i>, pueblo of Santo Tomas.<br\/><br\/>It will be noted that each of said documents refers to land located in the <i>barrio of San Rafael<\/i>.\u00a0 It will also be noted by reference to the petition in the present case, that the lands which the petitioners are seeking to have registered are located in the <i>barrio of San Antonio<\/i>, pueblo of Santo Tomas.\u00a0 No attempt was made, during the trial of the cause, to show that the lands described in said <i>composicion con el Estado<\/i>, located in the <i>barrio of San Rafael<\/i>, are the same lands described in the petition in the present case, located in the <i>barrio of San Antonio<\/i>, pueblo of Santo Tomas.<br\/><br\/>Said documents (at pp. 10, 14, and 18) furnish no proof, therefore, of the ownership of the petitioners of thelands in question.\u00a0 The fact that said documents presented relate to lands in a different barrio from the lands involved in the present case, leads us to doubt very much whether the other documents which are claimed to have been lost by the petitioners, refer to the lands involved in the present litigation.\u00a0 And moreover, by reference to paragraph 4 of the complaint, it will be seen that the petitioners claim that they purchased a portion of the lands in question from the following persons; Gregorio Centeno, Ignacio Anda, Simeon Malacaman, Catalino Antonio, Pedro Maloles, Maximo Malabuyok, Perfecto Quinio, Florentino Molayba, and Gregorio Macasadya, yet, during the trial of the cause no proof whatever was offered in support of said allegation.\u00a0 Not only did the petitioners present no proof showing that a portion of the land in question had been purchased from said persons, but they presented proof showing that said allegations were not true.\u00a0 The petitioner, Paula Maloles, testified that the land was obtained from the parents of herself and her husband.\u00a0 Not a word of testimony was given during the trial of the cause showing that any portion of the land was obtained from the persons mentioned in said paragraph 4 of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The petitioners, during the trial of the cause, attempted to show that they had been in possession of and actually cultivating the lands involved\u00a0 in the present litigation for a period of about thirty or more years.\u00a0 The proof, however, upon that question is very indefinite and uncertain.\u00a0 The proof presented by the opposition shows that the lands are generally mountainous forest lands and not devoted to nor adapted for agricultural purposes.\u00a0 The lands seem to be wholly mountainous forest lands.<br\/><br\/>The petitioners in their complaint prayed that if the court should find that they had not the title necessary for the registration of the property, that then they should be given the benefit of paragraph 6 of section 54 of Act No. 926.\u00a0 Said section refers to agricultural lands.\u00a0 The proof showing that the property in question is not agricultural land, we are unable to give the petitioners the benefit of said section.<br\/><br\/>One of the primary and fundamental purposes of the registration of land under the Torrens system is to secure to the owner an absolute, indefeasible title, free from all encumbrances and claims whatsoever, except those mentioned in the certificate of title, and, so far as it is possible, to make the certificate issued to\u00a0 the. owner by the court, absolute proof of such title.\u00a0 In order, however, that the petitioner for registration of his land under the Torrens system shall be permitted to have the same registered and to have the benefit resulting from the certificate of title finally issued, the burden is upon him to show that he is the <i>real<\/i> and <i>absolute owner, in fee simple<\/i>, of the lands which he is attempting to have registered.\u00a0 The petitioner is not entitled to have his lands registered under the Torrens system simply because no one appears to oppose his title and to oppose the registration of his lands.\u00a0 In order that land may be registered under the Torrens system, the petitioner must show, even though there is no opposition, that he is the absolute owner, in fee simple, of the same.\u00a0 Courts are not justified in registering property under the Torrens system in the name of the petitioner simply because there is no opposition offered.\u00a0 In view of the fact that the entire revenues of the state under certain conditions are made subject to the payment of damages for errors in the wrongful registration of property, courts should insist upon unquestionable proof of absolute ownership in fee simple on the part of the petitioner.\u00a0 The petitioner may be the owner, as a matter of fact, of the land and yet be unable to furnish satisfactory\u00a0 proof of the kind required for registration under the Torrens system at the time of the presentation of his petition for registration.\u00a0 The denial of the petition for registration is not conclusive proof that the petitioner is not the owner.\u00a0 The denial of a petition for registration simply indicates that he has not furnished that kind of proof showing an absolute title in fee simple which is required under the Torrens system.\u00a0 It is the duty\u00a0 of the courts, even in the absence of any opposition, to require the petitioner to show, by <i>a preponderance of the evidence <\/i>and by <i>positive<\/i> and <i>absolute proof<\/i>, so far as it is possible, that he is the owner in fee simple of the lands which he is attempting to have registered<br\/><br\/>After a careful examination of the record brought to this court, we find that there was no proof whatever adduced during the trial of the cause, justifying the registration of the land in question in favor of the petitioners.\u00a0 The petitioners have, failed utterly to prove the allegations of their complaint.\u00a0 Therefore the judgment of the lower court is hereby reversed, and without any finding as to costs, it is so ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

(U. S. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vs.<\/span> Andres Jayme, 20 Phil. Rep., 626.)<br\/><br\/>In support of our position in that case we cited and reaffirmed the doctrine laid down in United States <i>vs<\/i>. Casta\u00f1ares (18 Phil. Rep., 210); United States <i>vs<\/i>. Narvas (14 Phil. Rep., 410); United States <i>vs<\/i>. De la Santa (9 Phil. Rep., 22); wherein we discussed the nature and effect of the provisions of the first section of Act No. 1773.<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. De la Santa, <i>supra<\/i>,\u00a0 we said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is to be observed, however, that under the provisions of the above-cited article 448 of the Penal Code, jurisdiction over the crime of seduction is expressly denied the trial court unless such jurisdiction be conferred by one of certain persons specified in the law; in this case, as we have seen, by the offended person herself.\u00a0 The objection in this case is not, strictly speaking, to the sufficiency of the complaint, but goes directly to the jurisdiction of the court over the crime with which the accused was charged.\u00a0 It has been frequently held that a lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter is fatal, and subject to objection at any stage of the proceedings, either in the court below or on appeal (Ency. of PI. &amp; Pr.r vol. 12, p. 189, and large array of cases there cited), and indeed, where the subject matter is not within the\u00a0 jurisdiction, the court may dismiss the proceeding <i>ex mero motu<\/i>.\u00a0 (Wakefteld <i>vs<\/i>. Goudy, 4 111., 133; 190 Ind., 79; Chipman <i>vs<\/i>. Waterbury, 59 Conn., 496.)\"<\/blockquote>Jurisdiction <i>over the subject matter<\/i> in a judicial proceeding is conferred by the sovereign authority which organizes the court; it is given only by law and in the manner prescribed by law and an objection based on the lack of such jurisdiction cannot be waived\u00a0 by the parties.\u00a0 Hence, the accused in a criminal case cannot, by express\u00a0 aiver or otherwise, confer jurisdiction on a court over an offense as to which such jurisdiction has not been conferred upon such court by law.\u00a0 (Harkness vs. Hyde, 98 U. S., 476; Nazro <i>vs<\/i>. Cragin, 3 Dill (U. S.), 474; Baker <i>vs<\/i>. Chisholm, 3 Tex., 157; Gamber <i>vs<\/i>. Holben, 5 Mich., 331; Gilliland <i>vs<\/i>. Admrs. of Sellers, 2 Ohio St., 223; 82 Wis., 644; Fleischman <i>vs<\/i>. Walker, 91 111., 318.)<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Casta\u00f1ares, <i>supra<\/i> we said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The objection in this case, however, goes directly to the jurisdiction of the court.\u00a0 Jurisdiction over the crime of <i>injuria<\/i> is expressly denied to the court in these Islands by the above-cited provisions of section 1 of Act No. 1773, unless such jurisdiction is conferred by the filing of a <i>complaint<\/i>\u00a0 by the aggrieved party, his parents, grandparents, or guardian.\u00a0 In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Narvas (14 Phil. Rep., 410), we held that the <i>complaint<\/i> referred to in this section is a sworn written statement as defined in section 4 of General Orders, No. 58.\u00a0 The information upon which these proceedings were\u00a0 instituted was not such a complaint, and there can be no doubt, therefore, that the court below was without jurisdiction to proceed upon that information.\"<\/blockquote>A conviction or an acquittal before a court having no jurisdiction is, of course, like all the proceedings in the case, absolutely void, and therefore no bar to subsequent indictment and trial in a court which has jurisdiction of the offense.\u00a0 (Kepner <i>vs<\/i>. U. S. 195 U. S., 100, 129; Commonwealth <i>vs<\/i>. Peters, 12 Met, 387; 2 Hawk. P. C., c. 35, sec. 3; 1 Bishop's Crim. Law, sec. 1028.)<br\/><br\/>Citing as authority our decision in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Fideldia (22 Phil. Rep. 372), counsel contends that since the offended person in this case was shown to have been over 18 years of age at the time when the alleged offense was committed, he should not have been convicted of the crime of seduction.<br\/><br\/>Article 443 defines the crime of seduction as follows: <br\/><blockquote>\"The seduction of a virgin over twelve and under twenty three years of age, committed by any person in public authority, priest, servant, domestic, guardian, teacher, or any person who in any capacity shall have charge of the education of the woman seduced, or shall have her under his care, shall be punished by <i>prision correctional<\/i> in its minimum and medium degrees.<br\/><br\/>\"The same penalty shall be imposed upon any person who shall have carnal knowledge of his sister or descendant, even though she be over twenty-three years of age.<br\/><br\/>\"Any other person who by means of deceit shall accomplish the seduction of a woman over twelve and under twenty-three years of age shall suffer the penalty of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>\"The same penalty shall be imposed for any other act of lewdness committed by the same persons and under the same circumstances.\"<\/blockquote> But counsel contends that the age limitation fixed in this article should be held to have been modified in like manner as in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Fideldia, <i>supra,<\/i> where we held that the age limitation set forth in article 446 defining \"abduction\" had been modified.\u00a0 We cannot agree with this contention.<br\/><br\/>Article 446 of the Penal Code is as follows: <br\/><blockquote>\"The abduction of a virgin over twelve and under twenty three years of age, committed with her consent, shall be punished by <i>prision correccional<\/i> in its minimum and medium degrees.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Fideldia we said that the reduction of the age at which a woman may leave her home and marry without the consent of her father or other legal guardian from 23 years to 18 years, draws with it a like reduction from 23 years to 18 years in the limit prescribed in article 446 of the Penal Code under which a woman may be abducted <i>with her own consent<\/i><br\/><br\/>But the reasons assigned for the reduction of the age limit in the case of the abduction of a woman with her Own consent, as defined in article 446, are in no wise applicable in cases of seduction as defined in article 443.<br\/><br\/>As has been frequently pointed out, the gravamen of the offense of the abduction of a woman with her own consent, who is still under the control of her parents or guardians is \"the alarm and perturbance to the parents and family\" of the abducted person, and the infringement of the rights of the parent or guardian.\u00a0 But in cases of seduction, the gravamen of the offense is the wrong done the young woman who is seduced.\u00a0 It would be going far to hold that the reduction of the age at which a woman may leave her home and marry without the consent of her father or other legal guardian, carries with it, by necessary implication, a declaration that the seducer of a woman between the ages of 18 and 23 is not liable to conviction and punishment for the crime of seduction.\u00a0 In the case relied upon by appellant, United States <i>vs<\/i>. Fideldia, <i>supra<\/i>, we pointed\u00a0 out that not withstanding our conclusion that the accused could not be convicted of the crime of abduction, as defined in article 446 of the Code, it appearing that the young woman in that case was over 19 years of age at the time he was charged with abducting her, nevertheless it might be \"that he was guilty of seduction or some other allied offense.\"\u00a0 We see no reason for modifying the view expressed then, and we hold that the provisions of article 443 of the Penal Code are in no wise modified by the provisions of existing law touching the age at which a woman may marry without the consent of her parents or guardian.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the trial court convicting and sentencing the defendant arid appellant should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs of his instance against the appellant.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Mapa, Johnson<\/i>, and <i>Moreland, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

JUAN DACIR ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The appellants in this case were convicted of the crime of <i>robo con homicidio<\/i> (robbery on the occasion of which homicide was committed), and sentenced to life imprisonment.\u00a0 The information charges and the trial court found as facts, that the commission of the homicide, which constituted a component part of the complex crime of which the appellants were convicted, was marked by the aggravating circumstances of <i>alevosia<\/i> (treachery), <i conocida=\"\" premeditacion=\"\"><\/i> (deliberate premeditation),\u00a0 and that it was done for a price.\u00a0 If the evidence adduced at the trial was sufficient to sustain a conviction of the crime of <i>robo con homicidio<\/i>, it\u00a0 was undoubtedly sufficient to sustain the findings as to the existence of these aggravating circumstances, and it follows that if the judgment of conviction should be sustained on this appeal, this court would be compelled to raise the penalty from that of life imprisonment to death, that being the penalty prescribed by law for the offense with which the appellants were charged and of which they were convicted in the court below.<br\/><br\/>The evidence conclusively establishes that the murder described in the information was committed at or about the time and place therein set forth, but the connection of these appellants with the commission of the crime and the proof of the other circumstances under which it was committed rest almost entirely on the testimony of two self-confessed accomplices, who themselves were charged with the crime together with these appellants, but as to whom the information was dismissed in the court below in order that they might be used as witnesses for the prosecution.\u00a0 Without their testimony the evidence of record wholly fails to establish the guilt of the appellants.<br\/><br\/>Pending this appeal a motion for a new trial was submitted by counsel for the appellants on the ground of newly discovered evidence.\u00a0 The affidavits filed in support of this motion are to the effect that after the appellants were convicted and the trial had terminated in the court below, one of the informers on whose testimony the conviction was had, admitted, in a conversation with some friends, that these appellants took no part in the commission of the crime, and that he and his fellow informers were its sole authors.<br\/><br\/>In general, motions for a new trial based on affidavits of this kind are entitled to but scant consideration.\u00a0 The mere fact that after a solemn trial in a court of justice has been terminated, one of the witnesses, in conversation with friends or under pressure from interested parties, may tell a different story as to\u00a0 the incidents testified to by him, does not necessarily destroy the probative value of his testimony when on the witness stand.\u00a0 If new trials were granted in every instance where the interested party or parties succeed in inducing some of the witnesses to vary or modify their testimony outside of court and after the trial, there would never be an end of criminal litigation.\u00a0 The practice of this court has been to grant new trials in such cases only in very exceptional instances, as for example, in cases wherein it is made to appear\u00a0 that there was no evidence sustaining the judgment of conviction other than the testimony of a witness who is shown to have made contradictory statements as to material facts, and where it appears further that under all the circumstances of the case proof that the witness had varied or modified his testimony out of court and after the trial would lead the trial judge to a different conclusion.<br\/><br\/>The value as evidence of the testimony of a witness given in open court in the course of a trial had therein is due for the most part to the following considerations: That under such conditions it is given under the sanction of an oath and of the penalties prescribed for perjury; that the witness' story is told in the presence of an impartial judge in the course of a solemn trial in open court; that the witness is subject to cross-examination, with all the facilities afforded thereby to test the truth and accuracy of his statements and to develop his attitude of mind toward the parties, and his disposition to assist the cause of truth rather than to further some personal end; that the proceedings are had under the protection of the court and under such conditions as to remove, so far as is humanly possible, all likelihood that undue or unfair influences will be exercised to induce the witness to testify falsely; and finally that under the watchful eye of a trained judge his manner, his general bearing and demeanor and even the intonation of his voice often unconsciously disclose the degree of credit to which he is entitled as a witness.\u00a0 Manifestly, loose statements or even sworn statements of witnesses, made after the trial has closed, varying or contradicting their testimony given at the trial, will rarely be sufficient in the absence of special circumstances, to raise such a doubt as to the truth of their testimony given at the trial and accepted as true by the trial judge, as to justify the granting of\u00a0 a new trial.<br\/><br\/>Nevertheless, in the case at bar we have concluded after some hesitation to grant the prayer for a new trial.<br\/><br\/>Without accepting as true the testimony of the two witnesses who admitted their own participation in the commission of the bloody murder charged in the information, and as to whom the information was dismissed in order that they might be called to testify as to the alleged participation of the appellants, the judgment convicting the latter cannot be sustained.\u00a0 Indeed there is not a shred of evidence of record tending to connect two of the three appellants with the commission of the crime other than the testimony of these self-confessed accomplices.\u00a0 And while we have frequently held that the testimony of self-confessed accomplices is competent and admissible, and that it is sufficient, even when uncorroborated, to sustain a conviction in a criminal case if the court is satisfied as to its truth beyond a reasonable doubt, nevertheless, as we have indicated in a number of decisions, such evidence, especially when uncorroborated, should always be accepted doubtingly and subjected to the most painstaking scrutiny\u00a0 in view of the polluted source from which it comes.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Ocampo, 4 Phil. Rep., 400; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Granadoso, 16 Phil. Rep., 419; U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Bernales, 18 Phil Rep., 525.)\u00a0 The\u00a0 trial judge, who saw and heard these witnesses testify, was convinced that they spoke the truth, and in the absence of the affidavits filed with the motion for a new trial, we might have some hesitation in disturbing his findings in that regard.\u00a0 But reviewing the evidence of record in the light of these\u00a0 affidavits, we are inclined to think that upon a new trial, he might have some hesitation in accepting as true the story told by these witnesses at the former trial.\u00a0 Under all the circumstances\u00a0 surrounding the commission of the crime as developed by the evidence before us, there is nothing inherently improbable in the contentions of counsel for the appellants, based on the affidavits filed with the motion for a new trial.\u00a0 There can be no doubt that the two informers might have committed the crime in the manner and form in which it was in fact committed, without the intervention of the appellants; and that the motive which actuated them in murdering their victim, which was robbery, is as clearly disclosed under the theory of the commission of the crime contended for by counsel for the appellants as under that maintained by the prosecution.\u00a0 Furthermore, the dismissal of the charges against them\u00a0 in order that they might be used as witnesses for the prosecution offers a full and sufficient explanation of their attempt to incriminate the appellants, if in truth they themselves were the only guilty parties.<br\/><br\/>We are the\u00a0 more disposed to grant the motion for a new trial, because the trial judge, while he was fully convinced of the guilt of the appellants, states in his opinion that he suspected that the\u00a0 evidence of record did not thoroughly develop all the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime, and that he was satisfied that some of the witnesses were concealing facts which if disclosed to the court would shed further light on the motives which actuated the guilty parties and would clear up some features of the case which had not been satisfactorily developed at the trial.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from should be reversed, with the costs of this instance <i>de oficio<\/i>, and the record returned to the court wherein it originated for a new trial, wherein, following the practice laid down in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Singuimuto (3 Phil. Rep., 176, 183), both the prosecution and the defense will be permitted to offer such further and additional evidence as they desire to submit, but without the necessity of retaking the evidence already in the record.<br\/><br\/>So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Torres<\/i> and <i>Johnson, JJ<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Trent, J<\/i>., dissents.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"CENTER\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">CONCURRING<\/span><br\/><\/div><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">MORELAND, J.,<\/span><br\/><br\/>Generally speaking, I concur in this decision.\u00a0 If, however, it is meant by the last paragraph thereof to lay down the doctrine that, on a new trial in a criminal case, the court will be compelled, in spite of the objections of the accused, to receive, in favor of the prosecution and as a basis of conviction in the new trial, the typewritten declarations cf the witnesses of\u00a0 the prosecution taken on the former trial, none of the witnesses being recalled, I dissent from the doctrine laid down therein.<br\/><br\/>As is seen, recurring to the decision, that paragraph provides: \"The judgment appealed from should be reversed, with the costs of this instance <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de oficio<\/span>, the record returned to the court wherein it originated for a\u00a0 new trial, wherein,. following the practice laid down in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Singuimuto (3 Phil. Rep., 176, 183), both the prosecution and the defense will be permitted to offer such further and additional evidence as they desire to submit, but without the necessity of retaking the evidence already in the record.\"<br\/><br\/>The case referred to in this quotation provides, in this connection, simply that \"it will not be necessary to retake the testimony introduced at the trial up to that page of the record, but without prejudice to the rights of the parties to introduce such other evidence as they may desire to submit.\"<br\/><br\/>It is clear that this decision does not necessarily lay down the doctrine\u00a0 that, on a new trial in a criminal case, the prosecution has the unqualified right to present upon the new trial the typewritten testimony taken in the old and that the court must receive that testimony as the basis of the conviction of the defendant, even though he object to its introduction and ask to be confronted by the witnesses who testify against him.\u00a0 We have interpreted that decision in two or three subsequent decisions, some of them comparatively recent ones, in which we have held that it will not be necessary to retake any of the evidence received on\u00a0 the former trial, <i>provided the parties consent<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Mariano Nable Jose (R. G. No. 8125; not reported), we ordered a new trial, saying with respect to the procedure to be adopted in relation to the evidence taken on the former trial: \"The judgment is annulled and a new trial granted, with the understanding that, <i>if the parties so agree<\/i>, it will not be necessary to again present proofs already submitted.\"<br\/><br\/>I am opposed to the proposition that, on a new trial in a criminal case granted either by the trial or the appellate court, it is the unqualified right of the Government to refuse to produce the witnesses who testified on the first trial and to offer the typewritten evidence given by them on the first trial as proof of defendant's guilt; and that that evidence must be received by the court and made the basis of a conviction in spite of the objections of the accused who demands that the witnesses be produced and sworn.\u00a0 Where the defendant objects to that procedure and asks that the witnesses be presented, I am of the opinion that the court should require them to be produced in court except, of course, in those cases where the statute specially provides that the testimony of a witness given upon a former trial may be read in a subsequent trial.\u00a0 The principal reasons for my opposition to such a doctrine are:<br\/><br\/>In the first place, the statute requires that the defendant shall have a new <i>trial<\/i>.\u00a0 The word \"trial,\" when used in connection with the word \"new,\" has the same meaning essentially that it has when used alone.\u00a0 A new trial is not a new trial unless it is, with certain minor differences provided by law for special conditions, like\u00a0 the first trial.\u00a0 There is no reason why a \"trial,\" when it is a <i>first<\/i> trial, should be a different thing from a \"trial\" when it is a <i>second<\/i> trial.\u00a0 The word \"trial\" wherever used in the Code of Criminal Procedure means the same thing, whether it be a first trial, a second trial, a new trial, or an old trial.\u00a0 It is always a <i>trial<\/i>.\u00a0 The modifying word before it refers to <i>time<\/i> and not to <i>substance<\/i>.\u00a0 It is conceded that in the first trial the defendant is entitled to have\u00a0 the witnesses produced so that he may cross-examine them and that the court may see and observe them to determine whether they are testifying truthfully or falsely.\u00a0 Unless the statute prohibits it, and it does not, he is entitled to the same rights upon a new trial.\u00a0 Trials are trials.\u00a0 Neither interpretation nor\u00a0 construction should destroy their essential attributes.<br\/><br\/>In the second place, the judge who hears the new trial may not be the same judge who heard the old.\u00a0 That very frequently happens in this jurisdiction as a result of the changing personnel of the judiciary, brought about not only by natural causes and the nature of judicial tenure in this jurisdiction, but also as a result of the law giving the Secretary of Finance and Justice the power to transfer judges from one district or province to another and to name judges to hold special terms of court in provinces not their own.\u00a0 This frequent change of judges in the provinces is important\u00a0 in view of the fact that this court has laid down the rule repeatedly that, where the testimony adduced by the parties in a criminal trial is conflicting, the declarations of the witnesses for the prosecution being flatly in contradiction of those for the defense, this court will not interfere with the judgment of the trial court resolving these contradictions in favor of one set of witnesses or of the other except in very special cases.\u00a0 These holdings are grounded solely upon the fact that the trial judge had an opportunity to see the witnesses, to observe their manner in testifying, to study their attitudes and expressions, to uncover the motives and influences which dominated them\u2014in short, to acquaint himself thoroughly with every circumstance of the trial, and that, from these personal notes, observation and study, he is able to form a judgment as to the relative credibility of the witnesses more nearly correct than a judge who did not have those opportunities.\u00a0 Let us suppose that an accused who is convicted of murder obtains a new trial at the hands of this court and goes back for retrial before a different judge than presided at his first trial.\u00a0 Let us assume, further, that the witnesses who testified on the first trial are the only witnesses for the government; and that it is the law that these witnesses need not be again produced but that their declarations on the former trial may be\u00a0 read in evidence on the new trial.\u00a0 What is the result?\u00a0 It is that a defendant may be tried and convicted of murder and sentenced to be hanged by a judge who never saw or heard a single witness against him.\u00a0 I do not believe that this court ought by mere interpretation to lay down a rule which will produce such a result.\u00a0 There is absolutely no reason, practical or legal, for such a doctrine.\u00a0 Not at all to the point is the contention that the witnesses who declared in the first trial in favor of the prosecution may be out of the country when\u00a0 the new\u00a0 trial occurs.\u00a0 That is no reason why the court should, by interpretation or construction, entirely change the nature of a trial and make it the farce it would be under such circumstances.\u00a0 I do not believe that this is any reason for making the word \"trial\" mean a mere hearing on affidavits.\u00a0 It is the province of the legislature and not the courts to change definitions, alter procedure, make judges try men on records and not on the testimony of witnesses, rob them of that most distinctive and important function of personal observation, deprive appellate courts of the advantages of the full and free exercise of that function and the conclusions based thereon\u2014in short, to abrogate trials.\u00a0 In this jurisdiction the Supreme Court is the only court authorized by law to try cases on <i>records<\/i>.\u00a0 Such authority does not pertain to trial courts unless it is conferred by consent of all parties.<br\/><br\/>Thirdly, I am of the opinion that such a doctrine would be, to some extent at least, in violation of the principles laid down in United States <i>vs<\/i>. Donato (9 Phil. Rep., 701); United States <i>vs<\/i>. Manlimos (11 Phil. Rep., 547); and United States <i>vs<\/i>. Pobre (11 Phil. Rep., 51).\u00a0 These were all cases in which counsel agreed that, if certain additional witnesses were produced and sworn on behalf of the prosecution as well as of the defense, they would testify as actual witnesses had done as to\u00a0 the very substance of the issue.<br\/><br\/>In the case first cited the court said as to the regularity of such a proceeding: \"This court, however, upon attempting to review the evidence, has found it impossible to do so, because of the reprehensible abuse committed in resorting to such unlawful agreements, thereby frustrating the purposes of the law, which has been openly violated.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case last cited the court said in relation to a similar agreement:\u00a0 'The agreement entered into between the fiscal of Ilocos Norte and the counsel for the defendant refers to facts\u00a0 which favor the defense and to others connected with the prosecution; no evidence whatever was adduced, nor was the testimony of the witnesses mentioned in the agreement taken.\u00a0 This is a practice which is not authorized and\u00a0 defeats the\u00a0 purpose of the criminal law, being an open violation of the\u00a0 rules of criminal procedure, and particularly of the provisions of section 32 of General Orders, No. 58.\"<br\/><br\/>In the second case cited we have this statement as an additional reason why such agreements should not be permitted: \"Nor is it possible for a trial court to weigh with exact nicety the contradictory declarations of witnesses not produced so as to be subjected to\u00a0 its observation and its judgment as to their credibility,\"<br\/><br\/>While these cases are not in point so far as the questions decided are concerned, they rest upon reasons some of which move me to oppose the doctrine stated.\u00a0 The witnesses having already been sworn and the same judge who conducted the first trial presiding at the second, the objection going to the fact that the court did not see the witnesses or hear them testify is, partially at least, eliminated, and, under such circumstances, the full force of the doctrine stated in these cases would not apply <i>if the defendant consents to the introduction of the testimony taken on the first trial<\/i>.\u00a0 Where, however, a <i>different<\/i> judge presides at the new trial the precise objection urged by the court in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Manlimos applies, and it is clear from the holding in that case that the testimony taken on a previous cause, if that were the only testimony against the accused, would scarcely be acceptable before a different judge even if the defendant consented to its introduction.\u00a0 If the defendant objects to the testimony, there can be no question that it should be rejected under the decision of the court in United States <i>vs<\/i>. Manlimos, and very probably also under the other cases cited.<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Laranja (21 Phil. Rep., 500),\u00a0 it was held that \"a conviction cannot be set aside solely for the admission of testimony taken in another case, in pursuance of a voluntary stipulation between parties or their counsel, even if the appellant is represented only by the counsel assigned to him by the\u00a0 court; in making such a stipulation, the appellant\u00a0 waives his constitutional right to be confronted with the witnesses.\"<br\/><br\/>While this case distinguished the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Manlimos, it in no way affected the proposition to which I am using it as an authority.\u00a0 Touching this case the court said:\u00a0 \"In\u00a0 the last case, while it is true that this court said that it could not accept as the full equivalent of proof on oath that if certain witnesses were produced they would testify as the actual witnesses had done as to the very substance of the issue, yet the decision did not rest upon this ground, but upon the ground that if a crime had been committed at all it was not that of <i>estafa<\/i>.\"<br\/><br\/>This case is in no sense in\u00a0 point relative to the matter here under discussion.\u00a0 It may be said, however, that the whole trend of the reasoning of\u00a0 this case is toward the proposition that if the defendant had objected to the introduction either of the\u00a0 record in the Iyon case or had demanded that the witnesses of the Government be called, it would have been error if the court had refused to accede to the of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Lorenzana (12 Phil. Rep., 64), and that of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Raymundo (14 Phil. Rep., 416).\u00a0 Both of these seem to assume that the introduction of the testimony taken on a previous trial of the accused or on a trial of a coaccused was inadmissible over the objection of the defendant.<br\/><br\/>There is an expression of opinion in the case of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Anastasio (6 Phil. Rep., 413) which is substantially in point in this case, although it may, perhaps, be obiter.\u00a0 That was\u00a0 an appeal on a second trial of the accused had upon an information based upon the same facts as those forming the gravamen of the charge in the first trial.\u00a0 The\u00a0 evidence taken at the first trial against the accused was offered in the second trial in the form of\u00a0 the typewritten\u00a0 declarations of the witnesses sworn for the Government.\u00a0 The accused consented to the introduction of those declarations and the case of the prosecution was submitted and rested solely upon that evidence.\u00a0 The\u00a0 defendant having been convicted appealed to this court and raised the question that the trial was illegal as being in violation of his constitutional right to be confronted with the witnesses against him and to cross-examine them.\u00a0 This court held that, <i>by consenting<\/i> to the introduction of the evidence taken on the first trial, he had waived the constitutional right referred to, and that the conviction based upon the evidence of record was sustainable.\u00a0 One paragraph of the decision of the court in that case, although, as I have said, it may be mere opinion, supports to the full the proposition I am urging and was the deliberate opinion of a unanimous court, the same judge writing that decision who writes this.\u00a0 The court, by Mr. Justice Carson, said:\u00a0 \"This trial and the former trial were heard before the same judge and were based on the same facts and the accused and his counsel were present when the evidence of record in the former trial was taken, and exercised the right to cross-examine the witnesses for the prosecution and to present his own witnesses for the defense.\u00a0 It thus appears that both the primary and secondary purposes of confrontation were attained and, <i>while there can be no doubt that the accused had the right to demand that the witnesses be called again to testify if they could be produced<\/i>, there does not appear to be any reason based on the circumstances of this particular case which would prohibit him from waiving this right, nor does it appear that he was in any wise prejudice thereby.\"<br\/><br\/>In my judgment to lay down in this case the doctrine that I am opposing, it will be necessary to hold that the opinion of the court therein relative to that doctrine was badly conceived, immature, and unsound, and should not have been expressed.\u00a0 <i>It is a clear and unequivocal declaration that the accused has the same rights on the second trial that he had on the first<\/i>; and, being clearly founded in law as well as in justice, should not now be discarded for an interpretation which violates the express provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and makes a mockery of a trial <\/div>",

H. Sleeper, Director of the Bureau of Lands and representative of the Government of the Philippine Islands, a lease of said parcel of land.<br\/><br\/>This contract was executed on December 19, 1905, though effective from November 1 of the same year, for a term of one year from date and a rental price of $5 United States currency, or its equivalent in Philippine currency, per quarter, payable by the lessee at the expiration of each quarter.<br\/><br\/>On November 25, 1907, Paulino Samson filed a complaint with the justice of the peace of Binang, wherein he alleged that Esteban Zarraga had simulated a deed of sale of his leasehold over the parcel of land in question and thereby obtained from the Director of Lands a contract of lease by virtue of which Zarraga was occupying the said parcel of land; that the complainant had applied to the administrator of the estate in the said pueblo of Bi\u00f1ang, protesting against such occupation, and that the administrator replied to him that his action in the premises would depend on the judgment rendered in the matter by the court.\u00a0 The justice of the peace court of Binang decided the case in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, Esteban Zarraga, both parties being notified of this judgment on December 18, 1907.<br\/><br\/>In July, 1908, the administrator of the estate refused, Zarraga avers; to accept payment of the rent which the latter offered him and forbade Zarraga to continue cultivating the land.<br\/><br\/>In that year the administrator of the estate leased the land to Macaria Samson.\u00a0 The justice of the peace had stated to the administrator that the deed of sale executed by Paulino Samson in behalf of Esteban Zarraga was forged and void.\u00a0 Macaria is the daughter of Paulino Samson. She transferred her leasehold rights to Justiniano Jaojoco and the latter in turn conveyed them to Basilio Capunitan, to whom the Government sold the said land, since he was in 1910 the actual tenant thereof.<br\/><br\/>On December 23, 1909, Zarraga filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance of Laguna, wherein he requested that the court render judgment by ordering the above named C. H. Sleeper and Chas. H. Walt, as, respectively, Director of Lands and administrator of the lands of the Insular Government in the municipality of Bi\u00f1ang, Province of Laguna, to rescind and annul the contract or contracts of lease by them authorized, covenanted, and drawn up, of the land in question to the defendant, Justiniano Jaojoco, as well as his sublease to Baailio Capunitan; like wise by ordering that the said C. H. Sleeper and Chas. H. Walt grant and again restore to the plaintiff, Esteban Zarraga, through the proper instrument and lease, the possession to said property, on acount of his better and preferential right thereto and the absence of legal reasons to justify his ejection and eviction from the said possession; furthermore, by granting to the plaintiff damages to the extent of P500, for the payment of which the defendants, C. H. Sleeper and Chas. H. Walt, be held jointly and severally liable; and, finally, by sentencing all the defendants to pay the costs of the present suit.<br\/><br\/>In this complaint Macaria Samson was not included, nor was any petition whatever made therein relative to her lease from the Government.\u00a0 Therefore, even though the leases between the Government and Jaojoco and the Government and Capunitan were rescinded, as requested in the complaint, that executed between the Government and Macaria Samson could not be rescinded, as such rescission was not a purpose of the complaint.<br\/><br\/>The defendants answered the complaint; and the court found as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"First.\u00a0 Esteban Zarraga was the tenant or lawful occupant of the land in question at the time the Government acquired the Bifiang estate, for he had acquired from Paulino Samson all the rights and actions which the latter had to the land as lessee of the friars.<br\/><br\/>\"Second.\u00a0 The character of tenant or occupant with which Esteban Zarraga was vested upon the acquisition of the said estate by the Insular Government has already been recognized by the Government by the fact that he was granted a lease in 1905, he having paid the rents and complied with all the conditions of the contract.<br\/><br\/>\"Third.\u00a0 According to the evidence, Esteban Zarraga was without just cause deprived of the land, in violation of the Philippine Bill and Act No. 1120, and the Director of Lands leased it to Macaria Samson, who transferred her rights therein to Justiniano Jaojoco and this latter in turn to Basilio Capunitan, who acquired by purchase and at present Holds'the land in question.<br\/><br\/>\"Fourth.\u00a0 Pursuant to the Philippine Bill and Act No. 1120 of the Philippine Commission, Esteban Zarraga is entitled, not only to be given by the Government a lease on the land in question, but also to buy the same at the price fixed by the Insular Government, that is, for the same price for which it was sold to Basilio Capunitan.<br\/><br\/>\"Fifth.\u00a0 The said Act having been violated, it is evident that the contracts previously made with Macaria Samson by the Director of Lands and the transfer by the former of her rights to Justiniano Jaojoco and by this latter to Basilio Capunitan are and ought to be declared null and void, as likewise the sale made by the Director of Lands, in representation of the Government, to Basilio Capunitan.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, the court holds that Esteban Zarraga has preferential right to lease and purchase from the Government the land in question, in accordance with the law, and that the grants made by the Government, through the Director of Lands, to Macaria Samson and Justiniano Jaojoco, and the sale made to Basilio Capunitan, are null and void and contrary to the provisions of the Philippine Bill and Act No. 1120; consequently, it is the sentence of this court that Basilio Capunitan restore the disputed land to Esteban Zarraga, and that the Director of Lands, the defendant, in representation of the Government, sell the said land to the plaintiff Zarraga under the same conditions allowed Capunitan, upon payment of the price paid by the latter, and the plaintiff must comply with the other conditions of the purchase.\u00a0 Capunitan's right to claim from the Government the sums paid is reserved to him.<br\/><br\/>\"The defendants are sentenced jointly and severally to pay the costs of this case.\"<\/blockquote>Such part of the judgment as refers to Macaria Samson must forthwith be set aside as being absolutely null and void, inasmuch as the lease between her and the Government was not a subject of the complaint, nor was she a party to the present suit.<br\/><br\/>The Constitutional Law for the Philippines and the Act of the Philippine Commission, No. 1120, which are cited in the third conclusion of the trial court, say, in the parts thereof pertinent to the matter under discussion, quoting first from section 65 of the Philippine Bill or the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902:<br\/><blockquote>\"That all lands acquired by virtue of the preceding section shall constitute a part and portion of the public property of the Government of the Philippine Islands, and may be held, sold, and conveyed, or leased temporarily for a period not exceeding <i>three<\/i> years after their acquisition by said Government on such terms and <i>conditions<\/i> as it may prescribe, subject to the limitations and conditions provided for in this Act * * *. Actual settlers and occupants at the time said lands are acquired by the Government shall have the preference over all others to lease, purchase, or acquire their holdings within such reasonable time as may be determined by said Government.\"<\/blockquote>And Act No. 1120:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC .7.\u00a0 Upon the vesting of titles to said lands in the Government of the Philippine Islands * * * the Chief of the Bureau of Public Lands shall ascertain the names and residences of the actual, bona fide settlers and occupants then in possession of said lands or of any portion of them.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"Sec. 8.\u00a0 In case any occupant in possession does not desire to purchase his holding, but does desire to lease the same, then it shall be the duty of the Chief of the Bureau of Public Lands, after vesting of title, to see that such occupant attorns in due form to the Government and enters into a lease with the usual covenants and agrees to pay a reasonable rental for the use and occupation of his holding. Such rental shall be fixed by the Chief of the Bureau of Public Lands, but in no instance shall any lease be made for a longer term than three years.\"<\/blockquote>On December 19, 1905, Esteban Zarraga entered into a lease with C. H. Sleeper, the Director of Lands and representative of the Government of the Philippine Islands. He sets forth that the Government of the Philippine Islands is the absolute owner of a property known as the Bi\u00f1ang Estate, and he, \"recognizing the said facts and right, declares that he was one of the occupants of the aforementioned estate on the date of its acquisition by the Government of the Philippine Islands and that he occupied and occupies a parcel of the same situated in the barrio of Calaboso,\" the extent and boundaries, etc., whereof are conjectural. Mr. Sleeper, in his capacity of agent, leases to Esteban Zarraga the parcel of land described \"for the term of <i>one<\/i> year from the 1st of November, 1905, at a rental of $5, United States currency, or its equivalent in Philippine currency, quarterly, which rental the lessee shall pay to him upon the expiration, etc.,\" as hereinbefore stated.\u00a0 Esteban Zarraga \"accepts the conditions contained in the preceding clause * * *, expressly waives the right of prior notice of ejectment and, among other things, the right mentioned in article 1566 of the Civil Code\u2014that is, to a tacit renewal of the lease, since this contract can in no wise be understood to be extended beyond the term stipulated in the preceding clauses.\"<br\/><br\/>The actual and legitimate occupant of this parcel of land was Paulino Samson, as Zarraga himself has proved, and Mr. Sleeper should have leased it to Paulino Samson for the reason that the latter enjoyed a preferential right to the land; but Zarraga having shown an instrument apparently executed in November, 1901, wherein it appeared that Paulino Samson had sold him the said parcel of land, Zarraga was permitted by the Bureau of Public Lands to exercise the preferential rights in the lease which the law granted to Samson.\u00a0 That is how Zarraga entered upon the estate as the lessee of the parcel in question.<br\/><br\/>This lease from the Bureau of Lands with Zarraga was to terminate on November 1, 1906.<br\/><br\/>Zarraga, during the trial, ratified the terms and conditions of his lease, as hereinbefore set forth.\u00a0 He stated that Paulino Samson was the owner of the parcel in question and that what he, Zarraga, had purchased was the rigrht of possession, Samson continuing to hold the property; but he finally stated, clearly, that Samson was nothing more than \"a lessee of the friars.\"\u00a0 He testified that when that deed of sale was made in his favor, two other children of Paulino Samson had died and that only Macaria Samson survived.<br\/><br\/>Charles H. Walt testified that Zarraga continued in the lease until the expiration of his contract; that the justice of the peace of Binang told witness that he had decided a suit between Paulino Samson and Esteban Zarraga in the former's favor because the instrument of purchase and sale between them had been forged and was void; and that subsequently, after the death of Paulino Samson, the land was leased to his daughter, Macaria Samson.\u00a0 Then the provincial fiscal, in representation of C. H. Sleeper, presented in evidence the lease between the Government and Zarraga, which the latter had presented as one of his proofs.\u00a0 The provincial fiscal called attention to the clause wherein it was stipulated by the parties thereto that the contract should be for the term of one year, beginning with November 1, 1905, and Zarraga's counsel offered no objection whatever to the admission of that claim. Thereupon the witness, Walt, added that Macaria Samson transferred the lease to Justiniano Jaojoco; that then, at the time of his testimony, the land had already been sold by the Government to Basilio Capunitan; and that the property had been adjudicated to Macaria Samson, not only because of the suit had and as a result of the judgment rendered by the justice of the peace court of Binang, but also for other reasons, after a careful investigation made by the inspector, Gore, whom witness served as interpreter.\u00a0 This investigation took place in 1908, and the judgment of the justice of the peace court of Binang was rendered in 1907.<br\/><br\/>During1 the trial the parties agreed \"that the right of lease which Macaria Samson held over this land was transferred to the defendant Justiniano Joajoco, who in turn conveyed the same to the other defendant, Basilio Capunitan, who purchased the property from the Government and is now in possession thereof.\"<br\/><br\/>All the other evidence, rather prolix, taken with reference to whether Paulino Samson had or had not signed the instrument of purchase and sale, declared to be false and void by the justice of the peace court of Bi\u00f1ang, and whether the contract was really one of sale or of antichresis, has absolutely no bearing on this case. Be that contract whatever it may, and whether or not it was signed by Paulino Samson, the only facts to be taken into account in the decision of this suit are that Paulino Samson was but a mere lessee of the said land, not the holder in any manner of the right of ownership, or of possession, or of any other right except to use of the land, which is the right granted in the lease.<br\/><br\/>The conclusions drawn from the facts thus stated are:\u00a0 (1) That the document presented by Esteban Zarraga produced the effect which he had intended; and whether rightly or fraudulently, it now means nothing unless, in the latter case, perhaps against Zarraga; (2) that the first lessee of the land was Esteban Zarraga, whose preferential right the Government recognized, as substitute of Paulino Samson, toward whom he was obligated to continue the lease in the capacity of tenant or occupant of the land at the time of its acquisition, and thus was satisfied the right, whether of Paulino Samson or of Esteban Zarraga, to continue in the tenancy of the land when the Government became the owner of the estate; (3) that the lease with Zarraga was for the term of one year, which had expired on November 1, 1906, without his being vested with the right, on account of his express waiver of the same, to continue holding the land for a longer period under color of a tacit renewal of the lease; and (4) that at the expiration of the term of one year, when the Government was free to contract a new lease, and Paulino Samson had, moreover, died, it did so with his only legitimate daughter, Macaria Samson.<br\/><br\/>In view of these conclusions, it cannot be conceived what possible injury the Government can have caused to Esteban Zarraga to have warranted him to bring1 this wholly improper suit, to say nothing of what he has to do with Paulino Samson by reason of that contract, whether one of sale or of antichresis, which involves concepts of <i>dominium utile<\/i>, right of possession and others, such as that of lease of the <i>dominium directum<\/i> or property right <i>in rem<\/i>, which notions Zarraga deduced from that contract and injected into his complaint and which were all destroyed by his own hand upon his exhibiting1 as his proof the receipts issued to Paulino Samson by the administrator of the estate during the time of its previous owner, all of which receipts show no other cause of indebtedness nor right to collect than \"on account of his lease.\"<br\/><br\/>Such conclusions reached by us show that those specified in the judgment appealed from as the third, fourth, and fifth are absolutely devoid of foundation in fact and in law: the third, in so far as it says \"Esteban Zarraga was without just cause deprived of the land, in violation of the Philippine Bill and Act No. 1120 of the Commission, and the Director of Lands gave it under lease to Macaria Samson;\" the fourth, in so far as it affirms that \"pursuant to the Philippine Bill and Act No. 1120, Esteban Zarraga is entitled, not only to be given by the Government a lease on the land in question, but also to buy the same at the price fixed; and the fifth, in so far as it is inferred that all the contracts of lease entered into with Macaria Samson, Justiniano Jaojoco, and Basilio Capunitan are null and void, as well also as the sale made by the Government to Basilio Capunitan.<br\/><br\/>One method of terminating a lease is the expiration of the stipulated term. (Civil Code, art. 1569.)\u00a0 It is for this reason that a term is agreed upon in the contract. If the term of the lease with Zarraga, according to the evidence, expired on November 1, 1906, its expiration was sufficient reason for making another contract with Macaria Samson, the execution of which was no violation of the Philippine Bill or of Act No. 1120 of the Philippine Commission. Neither of these statutes prescribes that at the expiration of the term of a lease the lessee must still continue in the use of the land.<br\/><br\/>Neither is there any provision whatever in either of those laws which vests the first lessee of any land of the \"friar estates\" with perpetual right to lease the same.\u00a0 The right of preference to lease and to purchase is to be exercised \"within such reasonable time as may be determined by the Government of the Philippine Islands.\"\u00a0 (Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, sec. 65.) By reason of that preferential right, Zarraga was accorded the reasonable period of one year; hence he was able to be the first lessee, as he was the tenant or occupant of the land in lieu of Paulino Samson, and if he had, within this reasonable period, made use of his right to purchase, it surely could not but have been recognized, by virtue of the said legal provision, and the land in question would have been sold to him; however, as he was not the lessee on November 1, 1907, he was not entitled to preference in the purchase, nor in any matter in conneption with the said land, nor even to the right of bidding for a second or subsequent lease of the same land.\u00a0 Herein perhaps lies the error incurred in the judgment, by holding that when the \"friar estates\" were acquired by the Government, the settlers or occupants of parcels thereof acquired <i>in perpetuum<\/i> the right to cultivate the same under lease\u2014a meaning unauthorized by either the letter or the spirit of the Philippine Bill and Act No. 1120 of the Philippine Commission.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from is reversed and the defendants are hereby absolved from the complaint, with the costs of the first instance against the plaintiff, and without special finding with respect to those of this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Mapat Johnson, Moreland<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>,, concur. <\/div>",

CLAUDIA ALOC, OPPONENT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>ARELLANO, C.J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Pascual Antonio, a resident of the city of Cebu, Province of Cebu, died on September 14, 1910, leaving a will executed on December 6, 1908, and probated in the Court of First Instance of that district.\u00a0 The testator instituted his legitimate daughter, Laureana Antonio, as his universal heiress and devised to his wife by his fourth marriage, Claudia de los Santos, <i>alias<\/i> Aloe, some jewelry and P1,000 in cash.\u00a0 He also appointed as the testamentary executrix or executor of his will, first, his said daughter, Laureana Antonio, and, second, Mariano Antonio.\u00a0 The court selected and approved the appointment of Laureana Antonio as executrix and she entered upon the administration of the estate.\u00a0 Commissioners were appointed and they terminated their duties on April 25, 1911.<br\/><br\/>On this same date Laureana\u00a0 Antonio presented a report of her administration and petitioned the court to declare her to be the owner of all the property left by the deceased, in order to close the administration of the estate.<br\/><br\/>The widow, Claudia de los Santos, opposed this petition and the present suit was instituted for the purpose of deciding whether the widow is entitled to the conjugal property and to the widow's usufruct allowed by law, or whether, on the contrary, Laureana Antonio, the instituted universal heiress, should be declared to be the sole owner of the property left by her deceased father, Pascual Antonio (except the part thereof which\u00a0 consists of an hacienda in Leyte and belongs to Mariano Antonio).<br\/><br\/>Facts: On May 2, 1911, the widow, Claudia de los Santos, formally entered her appearance in the action for declaration of heirs,\u00a0 and, in paragraph 3 of her petition, stated:\u00a0 \"That she had never waived any right to which she might be entitled in the\u00a0 property left by the deceased, Pascual Antonio; that she did not remember having executed any document relative to such a waiver; and that, as, no copy thereof was attached, she could not under oath deny it.\"<br\/><br\/>On page 39 of the record appears an instrument of the following tenor, which was presented in evidence:<br\/><blockquote>\"I, Claudia de los Santos, of legal age and the widow of the deceased Don Pascual\u00a0 Antonio, hereby declare and set forth that I am informed of the contents of the will left by my late husband, the said Don Pascual Antonio, executed on December 6, 1908, and agree to all the provisions therein contained.\u00a0 I further declare that all the property left by my said husband at his\u00a0 death belonged to him alone, for the reason that it was\u00a0 acquired by him prior to our marriage.\u00a0 Therefore, in view of the above-stated facts and in consideration of the sum of P1, which I have received at the hands of Do\u00f1a Laureana Antonio, I hereby transfer and waive in favor of the latter, her heirs and assigns, all the rights I have or may have in or to the said property left by my deceased husband, the said Don\u00a0 Pascual Antonio, with the exception of the chattels left to me by my said husband and specified in paragraph 7 of his will, to wit, all the jewelry given to me by my said husband at our marriage and also the sum of Pl,000 in cash.\u00a0 I have in my possession all the jewelry just above mentioned.\u00a0 And I henceforth absolutely waive all the rights which I have or may have to make claim, judicially or extra judicially, to the said property or rights hereinbefore renounced, and I further set forth that in this waiver and transfer are included all the rights pertaining to any of the said property and to the usufruct of the same or to any\u00a0 part thereof.\u00a0 In witness whereof, I have executed this\u00a0 document in Cebu, Cebu, Philippine Islands, this 20th day of September,\u00a0 1910.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: right;\">(Sgd.)\u00a0 \"CLAUDIA DE LOS SANTOS.\"<\/div><\/blockquote>The foregoing is signed by two witnesses and the ratification made before the notary on the same date.<br\/><br\/>With respect to this instrument, the widow stated under oath that she specifically denied having signed any document whatsoever and that the only one which she remembered having signed was the authorization which was said to be required in favor of Martin M. Levering so that he might bring before the court the matter of the\u00a0 estate of the late Pascual Antonio and administer such property until the claims of the creditors should be paid.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the estate left by her deceased husband, she stated that all the property which appeared as inventoried, with the exception of the Leyte hacienda and the tiled-roof house in the sitio of Mauco, on Manalili Street (1 and 5 of the inventory), was acquired during her marriage with the deceased, and, furthermore, that there should be included in the inventory 250 carabaos, 300 head of cattle, and a vehicle, also acquired during her marriage with the deceased\".\u00a0 She therefore\u00a0 petitioned that all the property just above specified be included in the inventory and declared to be conjugal property, that she be awarded one-half of such property as should be left after liquidation, also the usufruct to which she was entitled by law, that the said Laureana Antonio be removed from her position of administratrix of the estate and that Jaime Vano be appointed in her stead.<br\/><br\/>The widow did not prove the existence of the number of carabaos and cattle she declared there were.\u00a0 A witness stated that the vehicle, which she said was worth P50, had a long time since been destroyed; and as to the two houses listed in the inventory (3 and 4) on Magallanes Street, Cebu, all there is concerning them in the record is that they had been rebuilt one or two years before Pascual Antonio's death; but the witness who so testified, while admitting as he did that one of them had been burned and that on the lot it occupied those reconstructions were made, yet he did not know whether they were rebuilt out of the amount paid as insurance or with what other funds.\u00a0 It is taken for granted that Claudia de los Santos was the fourth wife of Pascual Antonio and that this last marriage of the deceased only lasted seven years.\u00a0 The heiress proved, by means of 83 certificates issued to her in 1905, her ownership of a like number of cattle, principally horses, including some 10 carabaos, male and female, which, with their calves, now amount to about 120 head, and by 13 certificates issued to Pascual Antonio, also in 1905, likewise her ownership of that many more carabaos.<br\/><br\/>The only proof positively presented by the widow, Claudia de Los Santos, consists of three letters addressed to her from the Leyte hacienda by the heiress, Laureana Antonio, in which the writer refers to the enormous losses she suffered as a result of the typhoon that\u00a0 passed through her section and, in speaking of the loss of stock, says \"<i>our<\/i> stock;\" from which the widow concludes that the heiress considered her even then a sharer in the property left by the testator, and she supports this argument with a philosophical dissertation developed by a witness on the meaning of two different adjectives used in Visayan to\u00a0 express the possessive <i>our<\/i>.\u00a0 But all this argument falls to the ground,\u00a0 for the heiress also says in these letters \"<i>our<\/i> hacienda\" \"our laborers have not yet been able to plant even sugar cane,\" and the widow explicity and repeatedly stated that the hacienda with all its appurtenances belonged exclusively to her husband; furthermore,\u00a0 the\u00a0 heiress in\u00a0 one\u00a0 of her letters says to the widow, \"Pay without fail <i>our<\/i> debt to Don Tomas,\" and in a subsequent letter, 'That debt of <i>mine<\/i>, Calao to Don Tomas, pay it without fail at the end of this month\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *.\"\u00a0 So that argument has absolutely no importance.<br\/><br\/>The record discloses no proof whatever of this second claim of the\u00a0 widow.\u00a0 There is no property which appears as specifically acquired during the fourth marriage of the deceased.<br\/><br\/>With respect to her first claim, bearing on the existence, validity, and force of the instrument executed by her, the following facts appear from the evidence:<br\/><ol><li>As before seen, she stated in her written petition of May 2, 1911, that she did not remember having executed any document whatever relative to any waiver of her rights in her husband's property.\u00a0 (Record, p. 37).<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>During the trial she admitted having signed such a document in the house of the notary, Mr. Levering (p. 46), but added that after\u00a0 it was signed it remained in the latter's possession (p, 47).<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>She afterwards admitted it to be a fact that the original document was kept in the house of the family with whom she and the heiress lived and in a box the key of which was held by the latter, but which she took the liberty to open during the heiress's absence on the Leyte hacienda; that she delivered the document to a party who made a copy of it; and that since then this original document, which she\u00a0 stated she replaced in the box,\u00a0 had disappeared.\u00a0 It was upon proof of its disappearance that the court admitted in evidence one of the two copies which the notary had kept in his office.\u00a0 This copy is the one which was presented and admitted without objection (pp. 39 and 40).<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>Continuing her testimony, the widow finally explicitly stated that she removed from the said box the same document she had <i>signed<\/i> in the month of September, and that?\u00a0 she was sure of this because she had seen her signature; that after its removal she delivered it to Pacencio Rosales in order that he might make a copy of it.\u00a0 This Pacencio Rosales, the widow stated, was a tenant on one of the properties of the estate.\u00a0 One day he went to see her about some work on his place.\u00a0 On this occasion he inquired of her as to which\u00a0 of the properties of the estate was the one that belonged to her, and she casually remarked that Laureana now still treated her well, but would end matters later by driving her out of the house.\u00a0 It was then that she took out the papers and Rosales, on seeing them, said:\u00a0 \"Here is one signed by you;\" to which she replied:\u00a0 \"If the document I signed remained in Mr. Levering's office, how can it be here?\"\u00a0 Rosales related to her the contents of the document, and then she exclaimed:\u00a0 \"Why, I would be crazy to give up all my rights for the sum of P1.\"\u00a0 In such manner she began her testimony, but, continuing it, she could not do otherwise than tell the truth, as we have seen: the document was not left in Mr. Levering's office, but was removed by her from the heiress's strong box, so the original does not now appear, and she pretends to be ignorant of its contents, which, however, were firmly established by a decisive finding of the trial court, in the following terms:<br\/><\/li><\/ol><blockquote>\"The document concerned in the\u00a0 evidence, having been prepared beforehand, prior to Dona Claudia's visit to Mr. Levering's office, was twice interpreted to her from Spanish, in which it was written, into the Visayan dialect\u2014the first time by Simplicio Kodis, a Visayan Filipino and clerk in Mr. Levering's office, and the second time by the aforementioned Mariano Antonio.\u00a0 The court finds no reason to believe that the said persons were incompetent or incapable as interpreters, nor is there sufficient evidence to incline the court to the belief that the interpretations were not correctly made and in good faith.\u00a0 The document in evidence having been thus interpreted to Dona Claudia de los Santos, she <i>acquiesced therein<\/i> and immediately signed and executed it before Mr. Levering as notary public.\u00a0 The original of the document was given to Mariano Antonio, and directly thereafter Do\u00f1a Claudia, accompanied by Mariano Antonio and Timoteo Antonio, withdrew from Mr. Levering's office.\" (B. of E., p. 40.)<\/blockquote>All the grounds of the widow's opposition (the sole subject matter of this suit) have been destroyed by the above transcribed decisive finding of the trial court, which has been acquiesced in and has become final as regards this party who did not appeal therefrom.<br\/><br\/>As to the averment that she did not remember having executed any document relative to a waiver of rights in the property of the testamentary succession of her husband (p. 23), the court held, and her own testimony at trial proved, that such a document was in fact executed.<br\/><br\/>With respect to her explicit denial under oath of having signed any document whatever, particularly that attached to the record (pp. 39 and 40), she swore at the trial that she did sign it and the court, in accordance with her,own testimony? held this to be an established fact.<br\/><br\/>Concerning the allegation that the only document she remembered having signed was the authorization said to be required in favor of Mr. Levering so that he might bring before the court the matter of the estate of the late Pascual Antonio (p. 29), it is explicitly stated on page 40 of the bill of exceptions:\u00a0 \"The\u00a0 court does not assent and does <i>not<\/i> find this statement <i>to be true<\/i>,\" after having held in\u00a0 the finding above transcribed that \"after the document had been interpreted twice, she acquiesced therein and immediately signed and executed it.before Mr. Levering as notary public.\"<br\/><br\/>The suit should have been, terminated once the grounds of the opposition upon which it rested had thus been destroyed; but the court held in the judgment that:\u00a0 \"The document of transfer executed by Do\u00f1a Claudia de los Santos in favor of Do\u00f1a Laureana Antonio is null and void and of no effect.\"\u00a0 (B. of E., p. 51.)<br\/><br\/>Those grounds are, briefly: \"Dona Laureana is a woman 50 years of age, and Dona Claudia is eight years her junior.\u00a0 Do\u00f1a Laureana is of a dominating nature, strong-minded and very intelligent, judging from her features and the traits of her\u00a0 character observed during\u00a0 the trial.\u00a0 Do\u00f1a Claudia is of a passive nature, of a very gentle disposition, and apparently very easily influenced\u00a0 and directed by a dominating character.\u00a0 This opinion is based partly on their testimony and\u00a0 partly on conclusions which the court has drawn from their <i>appearance<\/i> while testifying in this case.\"\u00a0 (B. of E., p. 38.)<br\/><blockquote>\"Dona Claudia was unduly influenced by Do\u00f1a Laureana to believe that there\u00a0 was actually no property in which she was entitled to share.\u00a0 Indeed, there <i>is no<\/i> direct proof on this point, but the court is of the opinion that this finding (the conclusion concerning undue influence) is clearly deduced from the falsity of the declaration\u00a0 contained in the document in question.\"\u00a0 (B. of E., p. 45.)<br\/><br\/>\"Do\u00f1a Claudia would not have signed that document if she had known that the said declaration was false and that the deceased had left very valuable community property pertaining to his last marriage.\"\u00a0\u00a0 (B.\u00a0 of E.,\u00a0 p.\u00a0 48,)<\/blockquote>This court finds the following in the proceedings:<br\/><blockquote>\"Question by Do\u00f1a Claudia's attorney:\u00a0 The document paged 39 and 40 in the record of this case and which Mr. Levering says is a copy of another that you signed in his office on September 20, 1910, states that you made it to appear therein that all the property left by your deceased husband, Don Pascual Antonio, belonged individually to him as having been acquired prior to your marriage with the said deceased.\u00a0 <i>Do you know<\/i> whether all the property left by your said husband at his death was acquired during or before your marriage with Him?\u2014A.\u00a0 A part of this property was acquired prior to my marriage with my deceased husband, Pascual Antonio, and a part during our marriage.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Which part of\u00a0 this property was acquired during your marriage with your deceased husband?\u2014A.\u00a0 The two houses on Magallanes Street,<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 If you had been informed that in the document you signed in Mr. Levering's office it was made to appear that all the property left by your husband, including those two houses on Magailanes Street, was property in which you had no share because it was obtained before Pascual Antonio's marriage with you, would you have signed that document?\u2014A.\u00a0 Undoubtedly I would not, because <i>I am very well informed<\/i> that those two houses were acquired during our marriage.\u00a0 (Record,\u00a0 p. 48.)<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Before going to Mr. Levering's office-that is to say, one week after your husband's death and before signing that document in Mr. Levering's office-<i>did you know<\/i> whether or not, as Pascual Antonio's widow, you had any right in the property left by your deceased husband?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir; I did.\u00a0 (Eecord, p. 50,)<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 Why did you go there?\u2014A.\u00a0 Because Mrs. Laureana Antonio and I had already agreed beforehand that I should go to Mr, Levering's office to sign this document which concerns the appointment of Mr. Levering as attorney in the matter of the property pertaining to the administration of this estate.\"\u00a0 (Record, p. 45.)<\/blockquote>It has already been well demonstrated, in accordance with the decisive conclusion reached by the trial court in this matter, that Do\u00f1a Claudia did sign the document exactly as it now appears to have been executed, after it had twice been interpreted to her; that she expressed her agreement therewith and immediately signed it.<br\/><br\/>So then, she did not sign it in the belief that she was executing a power of attorney to Mr. Levering; the statement that she did is not true, says the trial court in his judgment.\u00a0 She signed it as being what it purports to be and as stipulating what therein appears as stipulated, written in Spanish and twice interpreted into Visayan correctly and in good faith, wherewith she expressed her agreement and signed and ratified the document before that notary public.<br\/><br\/>The grounds of law relied upon are: (1) That contracts in which consent was obtained by error, under violence, fey intimidation, or deceit are declared null and void by article 1265 of the Civil Code; and (2) that, as it is not practicable, nor possible, to express in a definition what constitutes fraud, the definition of fraud and of what is undue influence must rather be deduced from the particular rulings in the matter by the courts; that, in the case at bar, Do\u00f1a Claudia de los Santos was induced to go to the office of her stepdaughter's attorney for the purpose of making a transfer of all her rights in the conjugal property left by her husband, seduced by the false representation made her by Do\u00f1a Laureana Antonio that the deceased had not left any community property acquired during his last marriage.<br\/><br\/>It is true\u00a0 that contracts, although they contain the requisites mentioned in article\u00a0 1261, may be annulled whenever they are vitiated by any of the defects which invalidate them according to law.\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 1300.)\u00a0 It is also true that deceit or fraud is one of the defects which invalidate contracts pursuant to law.\u00a0 (Art. 1265.)\u00a0 The definition of deceit is given by the law itself.\u00a0 There is no reason why it should be left in each case to the determination of the courts.\u00a0 The law says :<br\/><blockquote>\"There is deceit when by words or insidious machinations on the part of one of the contracting parties the other is induced to execute a contract which without them he would not have made.\"\u00a0 (Civil Code, art. 1269.)<\/blockquote>Claudia de los Santos did not go the office of the notary, Mr. Levering, deceived by Laureana Antonio and imbued by her with the idea that there was no conjugal property to expect from her marriage.\u00a0 It has already been seen that she testified entirely to the contrary.\u00a0 Claudia de los Santos did not go to the office of the notary, Mr. Levering, as she says she did, to sign a document whereby the latter was to be appointed attorney in the matter of the property pertaining to the estate.\u00a0 Her statement that she did, the trial court said, is not true.\u00a0 She went there to sign, and did sign, a document of waiver of all the rights she might have in her husband's estate, which is the purport of the document in question, and she signed it after it had been interpreted to her twice and she was perfectly aware of its contents, she being content with what her husband had left her in the will.\u00a0 No premises are found in the record upon which to conclude:\u00a0 (1) That, before going to sign the document, she had been persuaded to believe, by force of the insidious machinations of Laureana Antonio, that there was no conjugal property from the last marriage; ( 2) that it was <i>after<\/i> she had signed the document that she learned that there was such conjugal property;\u00a0 and (3) that in fact there is conjugal property. There is no proof whatever of insidious words or machinations on the part of the said Laureana, nor is it this woman who wrote the contents of the document.\u00a0 No deceit whatever appears, either before, or after, or during the act of the execution of the document.<br\/><br\/>The finding of nullity of the document in question was not rendered upon the petition of either party; no one asked that the document be held to be null and void.\u00a0 Such nullity was not argued at trial.\u00a0 It was found outside of the pleadings and proofs, against the universal maxim of justice that trial and sentence must be in accord with pleadings and proofs, and only in accord with them, for such is a suit-pleadings, proofs, and sentence.\u00a0 The said finding, incongruous with all the elements of a suit, is therefore null and void.<br\/><br\/>The second and third findings of the judgment are the removal of Laureana Antonio as the executrix of the will and administratrix of the estate of the deceased Pascual Antonio and the appointment of H. B. Walker as administrator, with the will annexed, of the said estate.<br\/><br\/>The fourth finding declares Claudia de los Santos to be the widow\u00a0 of the deceased Pascual Antonio \"vested with all the legal rights in the conjugal property of the deceased Pascual Antonio, such as pertain to her as the widow of the said deceased.\"<br\/><br\/>The fifth finding directs the immediate delivery of the property of the estate to the new administrator and the inclusion in the inventory of the cattle and carabaos of the Leyte hacienda.<br\/><br\/>Since the document of waiver executed by Claudia de los Santos is absolutely valid and effective, and inasmuch as the legitimate daughter of the deceased Pascual Antonio has been found to be the universal owner of the latter's\u00a0 estate, instituted as such, in his will, and all the debts of the estate having been paid, there is no longer any reason for the holding of the special proceedings on the succession of Pascual Antonio.<br\/><br\/>Therefore the judgment appealed from is reversed as regards all its findings, especially those relative to the appointment of H. B. Walker as judicial administrator of the estate and the declaration of the rights of the surviving widow, Claudia de los Santos, in the succession of Pascual Antonio; without special finding as to costs in this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Torres, Johnson, Moreland,<\/i> and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>,, concur. <\/div>",

SABINO PACULAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">Appeal by counsel for the plaintiff, through bill of exceptions, from the judgment of November 8,1911, whereby the Honorable Dionisio Chanco, judge, absolved Sabino Paculan from the complaint, without special finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/>On November 9, 1910, counsel for the non-Christian named Fabian filed a written complaint in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur, alleging that the latter is the owner and possessor of a parcel of land acquired by homestead entry No. 3051 and situated in the place called Guisit, barrio of Sideg, municipality of Bangued; bounded on the north by the land of Sabino Paculan, on the east by a watercourse, on the south by Mount Gaco and the land of Cirilo Urbano, and on wife west by Mount Datag; that the complainant has been in public and peaceable possession of the said parcel of land, with residence thereon, having cleared it and been cultivating it since 1908; that on March 9, 1910, the defendant unlawfully seized the cultivated part and destroyed dikes raised thereon, thereby causing him damages to the extent of P50; that, subsequently to that date, the plaintiff extra judicially recovered the land and planted rice thereon, but the defendant again disturbed him by alleging claims contrary to the plaintiff's rights and performing on the land acts of a real owner and possessor thereof; that the defendant's claim of ownership to the said land has no legal foundation, for he has no legal right whatever thereto.\u00a0 Exhibit A is attached to the complaint, which prays that judgment be rendered in plaintiff's behalf by declaring that the defendant has no legal right or title to the land concerned and that he be sentenced to hold his peace forever, to pay P50 for losses and damages, and the\u00a0 costs.<br\/><br\/>In connection with a motion for the issuance of a preliminary injunction against the defendant to enjoin him from harvesting or reaping the rice sown on the land, counsel for the plaintiff presented a letter from the Director of Lands, dated at Baguio on April 27, 1910, and other documents relative to the said land granted as a homestead, together with a receipt issued in the office of the Director of Lands for the payment made of P10 as registration fees; but by an order of November 22, 1910, the court denied the motion and, in view of the agreement had between the parties, directed that the products of the land be equally divided between both parties.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer filed to the foregoing complaint having been overruled, counsel for the defendant denied in his answer each and all of the allegations thereof and set up as a special defense that the land in question belongs, exclusively to the defendant; that the latter had inherited it from his deceased fether, who had\u00a0 acquired it by purchase in 1901 from Pio Palmares or Palmones and\u00a0 others, heirs of Pedro Avila Mariano; that the latter during his lifetime had held the property for about forty years; and that the plaintiff by bringing this action had caused the defendant losses and damages in the sum of P150.\u00a0 He therefore asked that the defendant be absolved from the complaint and the plaintiff sentenced to pay P150 for said losses and damages, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>The case having come to trial, with the production of evidence by the parties, the court rendered the judgment aforementioned, whereupon counsel for the plaintiff excepted, and asked for a new trial.\u00a0 This motion was overruled, exception to the ruling was taken by the appellant, and the appropriate bill of exceptions was presented, approved, and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>This litigation concerns the ownership of a piece of Government land granted as a homestead to the plaintiff under the provisions of Act No. 926, Public Land Act, and of possession whereof he was deprived by the defendant, Sabino Paculan, who seized the property.<br\/><br\/>Against the petition of the plaintiff, Fabian, a non-Christian Igorot, that it be finally held that the defendant, Paculan, has no right nor legal title in the said land of which the former claimed to be the owner and possessor as the homesteader thereof, the\u00a0 latter objected that the property in question was of his exclusive ownership, inasmuch as he had inherited it from his deceased father, Felipe Paculan, who himself had acquired it by purchase in 1901 from Pio Palmares or Palmones and others, as heirs of Pedro Avila Mariano, and that the latter during his lifetime had held it for some forty years.<br\/><br\/>This allegation of the defendant does not appear to be sustained by\u00a0 the oral and documentary evidence introduced by him, for the record does not show that the land in litigation was comprised in the possessory information title obtained and inscribed in the property registry of Abra on August 2,1895, and exhibited by the defendant, both because its conditions are different from those of the lands mentioned in the said information and\u00a0 because the boundaries of the property in question are distinct from those recorded as pertaining to the several parcels of land concerned in the aforementioned possessory title; from all of which it is concluded that the defendant has not duly proved the identity of the land which he alleges he purchased from the heirs of Pedro Avila Mariano, nor that the land acquired by him was that usurped from\u00a0 the plaintiff, which was mostly covered with forest.<br\/><br\/>The defendant's testimony has neither corroborated his averment, nor explained or supplied the deficiency of his documentary evidence.\u00a0 On the\u00a0 contrary, the record discloses that not all of those said to be the heirs of the deceased Pedro Avila Mariano took\u00a0 part in the sale of the land claimed by the defendant Paculan to have been acquired by him, and this fact is affirmed by Miguel Palmones, one of the said heirs; and Pio Palmones, not Palmares as appears in the document, Exhibit A, of the defendant, translated on\u00a0 page 71, stated under oath on page 25 that the land in question was not what was sold by him and his coheirs to Felipe Paculan, the defendant's father, for this latter tract was planted in vegetables\u00a0 and was situated northeast of the land in dispute, from which it was separate and distinct.<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing facts it is concluded that the land in question, obtained as a homestead from the Government by Fabian, the Igorot, is lawfully in the possession of the grantee, who was wrongfully deprived thereof by Sabino Paculan, although Paculan had no right whatever in the property, for he did not prove that it belonged to him or that he duly possessed it, yet he proceeded to usurp it to the plaintiff's detriment.<br\/><br\/>The rights acquired by the grantee, Fabian, in the disputed land are unquestionably sanctioned by Act No. 926, and once his application was accepted by the Director of Lands it must of course be presumed that Fabian's petition for the registration of the said land as a homestead was made out in conformity with the\u00a0 conditions prescribed by law, and, that the land sought was not occupied by any other person, for, after payment of the sum of P10 fixed by law, entry was made in the proper register of his petition and of the area of the land he had applied for.<br\/><br\/>The record shows that the Director of Lands transmitted five certified copies of various communications issued by his office, relative to the homestead grant made to the plaintiff Fabian.\u00a0 On November 10, 1908, he states to the applicant, Fabian, that he transmits therewith to\u00a0 him official receipt No, 195346 for the P10 paid as fees for the registration of his application for homestead, No. 6151; on April 27,1909, he informs the plaintiff, Fabian, that his homestead application for the land situated in the barrio of Sideg, pueblo of Bangued, had been examined and appears to comply with all the requirements of the law, and that the chief of the Forestry Bureau has certified that the said land is more valuable for agricultural than for forestry purposes, and that, consequently, his application has been approved and filed among the records of the office as homestead entry No. 3051, the writer advising that the applicant should, in all future communications addressed to the said department, make reference to the aforesaid registry number, 3051, and inviting the applicant's attention to paragraph 6, page 10, of the attached circular, which treats of residence on and cultivation\u00a0 of the land.\u00a0 In the communication of January 14, 1910, addressed to Sabino Paculan, the Director of Lands informs him that, after due investigation of his protest against the registration of the homestead applied for by the defendant, Fabian, it appears that the parcel of land sought by the latter is virgin Government land and has never been occupied or cultivated by any one, except now by the grantee, Fabian, wherefore it is the understanding of the Bureau of Lands that the said Paculan's opposition is defective and absolutely without good grounds and therefore rejected on this date, and that when Fabian shall have complied with the\u00a0 requirements of the law, he will in due season be issued the proper title of ownership to the land.\u00a0 On the same date, January 14, the Director of Lands informed Fabian that the adverse claim made by Sabino Paculan had been denied, and advised Fabian to continue in his possession of the land and to comply with the requirements of the law relative to its cultivation and residence thereon and that in due time he would be issued the appropriate ownership title thereto; and on the 5th of December of the same year, 1910, the same official, replying to a letter written by Fabian on the preceding 28th of November informs him that, in view of the fact that the latter was prohibited by the Court of First Instance from entering upon the land in question, the Bureau of Lands could take no action whatever in the matter until the said court should render a decision in the premises and that, should the judgment be adverse to him, proceedings would then be instituted against Sabino Paculan in accordance with the provisions of section 61 of Act No. 926.<br\/><br\/>So, it is an absolutely indisputable fact that Fabian, the plaintiff, was in lawful possession of the land which was granted to him by the Government pursuant to the Homestead Act until and up to the time that the defendant, Sabino Paculan, usurped the property and deprived him thereof; and although the plaintiff, Fabian, was not yet the owner in fee simple of the land, for the reason that the five years' period prescribed by law had not elapsed to have caused issuance to him of the proper ownership title on the 9th of March, 1910, the date of the usurpation, nevertheless it is unquestionable that he was the sole lawful possessor of the property, deserving of the protection of the law and the courts, inasmuch as this land belonging to the Government was held by him through an express grant with the expectation that if, for the period of five years fixed for the purpose, he complied with the conditions prescribed by law, he would be issued the appropriate property title as absolute owner of the land concerned in the said grant.<br\/><br\/>During the lapse of this period, and provided that the grantee fulfills the conditions imposed by law, among them those of residence on and cultivation of the land (condition which Fabian had been complying with, as shown by the record, until he was disturbed and dispossessed by the defendant) the plaintiff, Fabian, is the sole lawful possessor of the land as such grantee of the Government, the original owner of the property, and upon these premises he is entitled to the protection of the courts against all encroachment upon his rights.<br\/><br\/>The usurper, Sabino Paculan, was unable to allege any right whatever to support his forcible possession of the land in litigation, once his adverse claim filed in the Bureau of Lands against the application for homestead made by the plaintiff, Fabian, had been rejected for absolute lack of substantial grounds.\u00a0 Yet, notwithstanding this administrative decision, he still boldly continued wrongfully to detain the land, depriving the plaintiff of possession, and afterwards to maintain the present suit by means of oral and documentary evidence completely inadequate and impertinent, and in no wise has he succeeded in proving that the\u00a0 said land was already under cultivation and was not unappropriated land covered with forest, for, on the contrary, it was proved that the property which he stated he had purchased from the alleged heirs of the deceased Pedro Avila Mariano was a cultivated tract of ground planted in vegetables and entirely different from the land granted to the non-Christian, Fabian, by the Government as a homestead.<br\/><br\/>By acting in the reckless way he has, the defendant has made himself liable for the losses and damages he has caused the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment appealed from\u00a0 and hereby sentence the defendant, Sabino Paculan, forthwith to restore and deliver the land in question to the non-Christian, Fabian, to pay the latter the sum of P50 for losses and damages, and to pay the costs of both instances.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Cuyugan y Vergara.\u00a0 Pedro Sy Quia, who owned the land bounding upon the north side the lands sought to be registered, opposed the registration.\u00a0 After a trial in the Court of Land Registration the opposition of Sy Quia was overruled and the property was registered in the name of Manuel E. Cuyugan y Vergara aforesaid.\u00a0 After the\u00a0 registration of the land Manuel E. Cuyugan y Vergara sold the same to Lim Tuico in the manner prescribed in Act No. 496.<br\/><br\/>Until the 19th of December, 1911, no controversy had arisen between Pe\"dro Sy Quia and Manuel E. Cuyugan y Vergara or his grantee, Lim Tuico, in regard to the actual location of the line between their lands as described and defined in the decree of registration entered on the 11th day of July, 1907.\u00a0 On said December 19, 1911, the city of Manila presented to the Court of Land Registration the following writing:<br\/><blockquote>\"[Expediente No. 3325.\u00a0 Mariano Cuyugan, applicant]<br\/><br\/>\"The city of Manila by its attorney appears and respectfully sets forth to the court:<br\/><br\/>\"I. That the plan of the land to which the above proceedings refer contains an error of closure greater than 1\/1500;<br\/><br\/>\"II. That the city of Manila is interested in the correction of said error for the reason that it must condemn a part of said land for a public street.<br\/><br\/>\"Therefore, said city prays the court to order a hew measurement of said land described in the plan filed in this proceeding.\"<\/blockquote>Upon this application the Court of Land Registration made an order for a resurvey of said premises, and, upon the coming in of the report of the surveyor and of the plan accompanying the same, an order was entered on the 25th of January, 1912, \"fixing a time and place for the hearing of the matter and the approval of said plan, of which order all the interested parties were duly notified.\"\u00a0 Upon the hearing thus set there appeared the city of Manila, Lim Tuico, and Pedro Sy Quia.\u00a0 Without any of the parties objecting to or in any way questioning the power or authority of the city of Manila to begin such a proceeding, trial was had, evidence was introduced by the city, by Lim Tuico, and by Sy Quia relative to the location of the line between the lands registered and the lands of Sy Quia.\u00a0 Upon the evidence thus adduced the Court of Land Registration entered a decree providing:<br\/><blockquote>\"(<i>a<\/i>) That said\u00a0 new plan, being folio No. 68 of <i>expediente<\/i> No. 3325, be approved;<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>b<\/i>)\u00a0 That the certificate of title and duplicate thereof, entered\u00a0 and issued as aforesaid in the name of the said Lim Tuico, be canceled by the registrar of deeds of the city of Manila and that a new certificate of title be entered and a new duplicate issued to said Lim Tuico, including therein the technical description contained in said new plan, as follows:\u00a0 (New description.)<br\/><br\/>\"(<i>c<\/i>) That, for the purpose indicated, the duplicate certificate of title issued to the said Lim Tuico be delivered up to the said registrar of deeds without delay.\"<\/blockquote>This appeal is from that decree.<br\/><br\/>A comparison of the plan which was the basis of the original\u00a0 registration with the plan made under the proceedings initiated by the city of Manila discloses a difference in the size of the parcel of land which the two plans are supposed to describe.\u00a0 There also appears from such comparison a difference in the direction of one or more of the lines which mark the limits of said land.\u00a0 It appears from the record, indeed it is the cause of the controversy now before us, that the new plan takes from Sy Quia a small piece of land which pertained to him under the original plan and decree of the Court of Land Registration.\u00a0 In other words, the result of the proceedings instituted nearly four years after the final decree of the Court of Land Registration, Which final decree definitely and finally registered the land therein described, extends the limits of the land thus registered toward and upon the lands of Sy Quia, thereby depriving him of land which was found to belong to him in the proceedings resulting in said decree and which lands, by virtue of such finding, were excluded from registration in the name of Manuel E. Cuyugan y Vergara.\u00a0 It is thus seen that, under and as a result of proceedings begun by the city of Manila, the Court of Land Registration has opened a final decree of that court and changed not only the description but the area of the land registered by that decree.<br\/><br\/>This proceeding seems to have been conducted by the city of Manila, by Lim Tuico, and by the court upon the theory that its object was and the result would be the correction of a decree of the Court of Land Registration.\u00a0 That idea prevails throughout the case.\u00a0 It is manifest in the citation by the court of section 112 of Act No. 496 to support its power to maintain the proceeding, and it is apparent in the evidence and arguments presented by the appellee.\u00a0 We are of the opinion, however, that that is error.\u00a0 Whatever the intention of the parties and of the\u00a0 court may have been the result was not the correction of a decree but the making of a new decree upon new evidence.\u00a0 It was not the changing of a decree but the changing of the evidence upon which the decree was based.\u00a0 It is not questioned by any of the parties or contradicted by any portion of the record that the original decree, entered on the 11th day of July, 1907, was in its provisions in strict accord with the evidence in the case.\u00a0 The same description appears in the decree that appears in the plan submitted\u00a0 describing the lands registered.\u00a0 That plan was made by an expert surveyor who testified upon that proceeding to its correctness and to the location of the lines marking the boundaries of the lands registered.\u00a0 If there was a mistake in that description as given by the plan and the testimony given by\u00a0 the surveyor who made it to\u00a0 prove its correctness, it was a mistake of evidence, an error of fact.\u00a0 A decree entered upon facts which are not true is not itself erroneous.\u00a0 It is a perfectly correct decree according to the evidence in the case.\u00a0 No other decree could have been entered.\u00a0 A decree which is at variance with the evidence presented to support that decree is an erroneous decree and, within certain limitations, may be corrected to conform to the evidence; but a decree which is entered in accordance with the evidence is not an erroneous decree\u00a0 but a correct one.<br\/><br\/>From this it is clear that what the Land Court attempted and accomplished was not the correction of a decree but the retrial of the case with the production of new and conflicting evidence and the entering of a new decree there-upon.\u00a0 That the\u00a0 proceeding was a new trial essentially is demonstrated by the fact that Lim Tuico claimed that the northern line was located at one place and introduced evidence to support that contention, while Sy Quia claimed that said line was located at another place and introduced evidence to support his contention.\u00a0 Different surveyors were presented as witnesses and gave conflicting testimony as to where the line between Lim Tuico and Sy Quia was really located.\u00a0 Upon this conflicting evidence the court found that the line was located differently from what its location was found to be on the trial of case No. 3325 which resulted in the\u00a0 decree of July\u00a0 11, 1907.\u00a0 It found that, according to the preponderance of the evidence, the line was located as described in the new plan made by the surveyor favorable to Lim Tuico and adjudged that the land registered in 1907 was not correct in amount or description.\u00a0 It, therefore, decreed the registration of the newly described parcel of land.<br\/><br\/>It is our opinion that the Court of Land Registration exceeded its authority.\u00a0 The original and fundamental purpose of Act No. 496 was to settle finally and for all time the title to land registered.\u00a0 A decree of registration cannot be permanent if the limits of the land therein registered may be changed or the amount of land so registered altered by a subsequent adjudication of said court based upon new evidence tending to show that the evidence introduced on the former hearing was incorrect.\u00a0 The fact that A, who obtains a judgment against B for P1,000, subsequently discovers that the evidence which he gave on the trial of that case erroneously showed that the sum due him was P1,000 instead of f 1,500, the amount really due him, does not permit him to apply to the court four years later to open said judgment, retry the case, introduce evidence establishing a debt of P1,500, and obtain a judgment against B for P1,500 instead of P1,000, under cover of the claim that he had made a mistake in giving his evidence originally.<br\/><br\/>It is of no importance that the claim in this proceeding is made that the error complained of is one of closure.\u00a0 The naming of the error does not alter its nature nor does it alter the nature of the proceeding based\u00a0 upon it.\u00a0 The difficulty is that, while the city of Manila alleges that there is an error, Sy Quia, who is injured by its correction if it be an error, denies that such error existed or exists and produces witnesses to sustain his denial.\u00a0 Where an error of evidence is alleged there always results an issue of fact if the existence of the error is denied by the opposing party.\u00a0 Just as in the example given, B comes forward and alleges that there was no error in A's evidence tending to show a debt of P1,000 for the reason that he never owed A more than P1,000, thus producing an issue, so, in the present case, Sy Quia comes forward and says there was no error in the former description, that the line located in the original plan was properly located, and denies,\u00a0 producing witnesses to support that denial, that Lim Tuico has any right or authority in fact or in law to take from him any land by any proceeding whatever, especially under cover of correcting an error.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, contests arising over the location of division lines are actions <i>in personam<\/i> and must be tried in the ordinary courts of law and not in the Court of Land Registration.\u00a0 They are actions involving the title to real estate, damages for illegal detention, for the cutting of timber, or the taking of crops.\u00a0 Sometimes they are for ejectment and sometimes for trespass.\u00a0 After the land has been registered the Court of Land Registration ceases to have jurisdiction over it for any purpose and it returns to the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of law of the Islands for all subsequent purposes.\u00a0 The only authority remaining in the Court of Land Registration after its decree becomes final is that given to it by section 112 of Act No. 496.\u00a0 That section does not convey authority to conduct a proceeding like the present or to take cognizance in any way of disputes subsequently arising between adjoining owners and owners of the land registered.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is reversed and the proceeding dismissed.\u00a0 No costs.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\u00a0 C, J<\/i>., and <i>Torres, J<\/i>., concur.<br\/><i>Trent, J<\/i>., concurs in the result.<\/div>",

through reckless negligence or rather through fearful negligence, but find him guilty of a violation of the\u00a0 regulations through\u00a0 imprudence and negligence, which resulted in the death of the child as alleged in the complaint, and sentence him to five months of <i>arresto mayor<\/i>, and to pay the costs of the action.\"<\/blockquote>The appellant in this case makes two contentions:\u00a0 First, that the trial court had\u00a0 no right to find as a fact that the defendant had violated an ordinance of the city of Manila, for the reason that said ordinance\u00a0 was not introduced in evidence and there was no proof of its existence, a court of general jurisdiction having no power or authority to take judicial notice of the existence of a municipal ordinance or of the contents of an ordinance admittedly\u00a0 existing.\u00a0 Second, that even though the right of the court be conceded to take judicial notice of the existence or contents of a municipal ordinance, still in this case there was no evidence to support the finding that such ordinance had been violated.<br\/><br\/>The rule of law laid down by the appellant in his first contention, if applicable at all to the Philippine Islands, a question which we do not now decide, is based upon the ground that courts of general jurisdiction are not required to enforce municipal ordinances, and therefore there exists no\u00a0 reason why they should take judicial notice of them.\u00a0 The legal proposition at the base of the doctrine contended for by the appellant is, that courts will take judicial notice only of those laws which they are required by law to enforce.\u00a0 This rule, even if applicable in this country, does not apply in this case for the reason that, under article 568 of the Penal Code, paragraph 2, courts of general jurisdiction are required, in a manner of speaking, to enforce municipal ordinances, their violation being an integral and essential part of the crime defined in that paragraph.\u00a0\u00a0 The paragraph referred to reads as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Any person who, while violating any regulation, shall, by any act of imprudence or negligence not amounting to reckless imprudence, commit an offense, shall suffer the penalty of <i>arresto mayor<\/i> in its medium and maximum degree.\"<\/blockquote>For the proper enforcement of this paragraph, knowledge of municipal ordinances on the part of the court is necessary, as they become a part of the general law which the courts are called upon to administer in this class of cases.\u00a0 In order, therefore, to enforce and administer the law as the duties of his office require, it is essential that a court of general jurisdiction know the municipal ordinances of the Islands.\u00a0 Being required to know the municipal ordinances, they are at liberty to take judicial notice of them.\u00a0 If they err in finding the existence of an ordinance when one really does not exist, or if they make a mistake as to the nature of an ordinance or its provisions, the judgment is subject to correction in the same manner as when they have erroneously assumed the existence of a law, or the provisions of a law the existence of which is conceded.<br\/><br\/>Relative to the second contention of the appellant, namely, that there is no evidence to sustain the finding that the ordinance was violated, we are of the opinion that it is not well founded.\u00a0 It appears from the record that a number of witnesses declare that the street car was running \"very fast.\"\u00a0 Others state, including the accused, that the street car was running with the lever set at \"nine points.\"\u00a0 It is shown by the testimony of other witnesses that a street car under the propulsion of a current indicated by the lever being placed at nine points would be going about 23 miles an hour.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the evidence, also, that post No. 961 and post No. 962 are 36.8 meters\u00a0 apart.\u00a0 The street car struck the child near post No. 961.\u00a0 Although the motorman knew that he had run over a child and, as he claims, did everything in his power to stop the car, he was unable to do so until he reached a point opposite to post No. 962.\u00a0 In other words the Car was running at such speed that it required a distance of 36.8 meters in which to stop it.<br\/><br\/>These facts are sufficient to sustain the finding that the ordinance was violated, it providing that \"it shall be unlawful for any street car to run at a greater speed than 12 miles per hour within the corporate limits of said city.\"<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that the court below erred in not finding the defendant guilty of homicide committed by reckless negligence.\u00a0 The evidence seems to us to be overwhelmingly against him.<br\/><br\/>The witness Mr. Tello, testifying for the Government, said in substance:<br\/><blockquote>\"I was standing at this point [indicating the point on the plan marked 'white post' and numbered 962]; 961 should be a white post and I was standing at No. 962, which is a black post.\u00a0 When the street car No. 111 was at a distance of one post and one-half from post\u00a0 No. 961, the post to stop at, when at a distance of a post and one-half from this stopping post, I saw the street car No. 111 running at its maximum speed of nine points; then the boy being at a distance of about 2 meters from the white post, there is the point where the street car ran over the child, dragging the child to a distance of 15 or 20 meters and from that point the street car left the child unconscious and went on running still for a distance of about 20 meters, leaving the rear part of the street car in front of post No. 962.\u00a0 And then I went around in front of the street car to see what the motorman was doing and what he had done, because I did\u00a0 not see any smoke from the trolley, and besides I saw that\u00a0 the reverse lever was in its place and he stopped the car only with the aid of the brake.<br\/><br\/>\"The child belonged to Se\u00f1ora Arsenia.\u00a0 She was in the Chinese <i>tienda<\/i> and when she\u00a0 saw this street car coming at a distance of a post and one-half from the stopping post she held up her hands to stop the car.\u00a0 She was at that time standing in front of the <i>tienda<\/i> at this place [indicating on the\u00a0 plan the point marked '947'].\u00a0 At that time the street car was at a distance of less than a post and a half from the stopping post.\u00a0 When I first saw the mother of the child motioning for the street car to stop, the street car was 3 meters before post 960 [indicating the point on the plan].\u00a0 The child at that time was about to cross the street-car track coming from this house [indicating the point on the plan marked No. 938].\u00a0 The\u00a0 street at that time was very clear, there was nothing in the street, no obstacles on the track.\u00a0\u00a0 The motorman did not stop the car when the mother of the child\u00a0 made motions to the car to stop.\u00a0 The car stopped opposite post No. 962.\u00a0 This was after the child was struck.\u00a0 I did not notice whether this motorman made any effort to stop the car while this woman was motioning to him to stop the car.\u00a0 When I first saw the mother of this child motioning to the motorman to stop the car, the child was about a meter and a half from the street-car track.\"<\/blockquote>On cross-examination this witness\u00a0 testified in part:<br\/><blockquote>\"When the car finally stopped, it had passed me at post No. 962. When the car stopped I walked around in front of it to see what the motorman had done to stop the car, and I saw that the reverse lever was in place and that he used only the brake to stop the car.\"<\/blockquote>Mrs. Chaves, mother of the child, another witness for the prosecution, testified in substance:<br\/><blockquote>\"I was buying some crude oil at that time at the Chinese <i>tienda<\/i>, and after I bought it when I turned around I saw that my child was about to cross the street-car track and then I saw this street-car coming and running fast; then I held up both hands and told the motorman to stop, but he did not do so.\u00a0 After running a certain distance he stopped, but my\u00a0 child was already hacked to pieces.<br\/><br\/>\"When I first saw the child coming across the street I was coming out of the Chinese <i>tienda<\/i>.\u00a0 I was on the right side of Calle Dakota going south and the child was on the left side from the place where I was and tried to cross the street-car track.\u00a0 When I first saw the child coming across the street toward the street-car track, I did not do anything to the child at all; my attention was called wholly to the street car that was coming.\u00a0 When I first raised my hands, the street car was about a post and a half from where I was.\u00a0 The street at that time was clear; there were no people there, but there were several people in the barber shop near there.\u00a0 It was not dark; it was light; it was 6.10.\u00a0 The motorman did not make any effort to stop the car when I motioned him to\u00a0 do so.\u00a0 My child was already dead when he stopped the car. The car was going fast at that time; it was going about nine, that is the speed.\u00a0 I am referring to the speed of the street car.\u00a0 The child Was named Juan and would have been 3 years old next month.\"<\/blockquote>Mr. de Jesus, testifying for the Government, said in substance:<br\/><blockquote>\"I was at the window of the house where the child was living when the accident happened.\u00a0 I was at the window at that time and the mother of the child went to the Chinese <i>tienda<\/i> to buy something there, and when I saw the street car it was in front of the white post and then I saw the mother making motions to stop the car, then I saw that the street car was coming and was near the child, and I also held up my hand to stop the car, but it kept running on until it struck the child.<br\/><br\/>\"The motorman stopped the car after it struck the child.\u00a0 I did not notice him turn the brake because I did not pay any attention to that.\u00a0 The car was coming fast.\u00a0 The car had already passed the white post when the woman held up her hands.\u00a0 I refer to the white post near the electric light, just in front of the light itself.\u00a0 That is the post that is reached by the street car before reaching my house, which is No. 938.\u00a0 When she motioned to the motorman to stop the car the boy was already near the track.\u00a0 At that particular moment the street car was about from here to the wall outside\" [indicating a distance of about 30 or 35 feet],<\/blockquote>Mrs. Reyes, a witness for the Government, testified in substance as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"I was coming from Calle Cementerio and when I arrived at a distance of 3 or 4 meters from the house where the boy was living I saw the mother of the boy making signals for the car to stop and I saw the child at a distance of about 1 yard from the track, then I turned around to ask for help so that the boy should be taken away\u00a0 from that place and when I turned back again neither the street car nor the child was in that place; the child was dragged.<br\/><br\/>\"When I first saw the child approaching the street-car track the car was at a distance of about 35 meters, more or less.\u00a0 I did not see the motorman do anything while the woman was signaling him to stop.\u00a0 The car was going very fast, I could not say how fast.\u00a0 I did not hear the motorman give any warning of his approach; I did not hear any bell rung.\u00a0 The car stopped at the next stopping post after it struck the child.\u00a0 I do not know what is the number of the post.\"<\/blockquote>Mr. Velasco, testifying for the Government, said in substance:<br\/><blockquote>\"I was at the door of the barber shop when the accident happened.\u00a0\u00a0 At the time when the mother of the child made the signals for the street car to stop it was at a distance of about one post from the child, and the child was walking across the street toward the mother.\u00a0 Although the mother made signals for the street car to stop, it did not stop and at that time the distance of the street car was about the distance of from here to the wall in the other room [indicating a distance of about 50 feet], but the street car was coming so fast that the child was caught and struck while it was inside the track.\u00a0 The distance from here to the wall to which I refer was the distance from the street car to the child when the child was inside the rails, and on account of the speed of the street car the boy did not succeed in crossing the track but was struck by the car.\u00a0 According to what I saw the car was going at full speed.\u00a0 When I first saw the mother motion to the\u00a0 motorman to stop the car, he did not do anything, he did not even turn the reverse or turn the brake, and after the child was dead the car stopped, after it had passed one more post, and the motorman got down and looked at the child, and I heard one conductor say\u2014I believe it was the conductor of this motorman, 'I gave the stop signal and he did not stop'.\u00a0 When the motorman arrived in front of the black post he rang the bell once.\u00a0 That black post is about as far as from here to that first post or a little farther than that from the Chino's <i>tienda<\/i>\" [indicating a distance of about 125 feet].<\/blockquote>This witness on cross-examination gave the following very significant and interesting testimony:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Wasn't there time for you to stop that child or pull it off the track?-A.\u00a0 There was time for me to snatch the child from that place, but I never believed he was going to be struck by the car, I believed the motorman had time to stop the car.\u00a0 I was looking at the child and he had his eyes too, and there was time for him to stop the car before the car got to where the child was.\u00a0 I did not go there and get the child because I never thought that he would let the car strike the child.\"<\/blockquote>On redirect examination this witness said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The motorman did not do anything; he did not turn the reverse nor apply the brake.\u00a0 He stopped the car after it got near the other post.\u00a0 He began to stop the car after the child was dead.\" <\/blockquote>In reply to questions put by the court, the witness said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It was after the child had been run over and its body left on\u00a0 the track before he made any effort to stop the car.\u00a0 After the child was left dead on the track, then he tried to stop the car.\"<\/blockquote>N. E. Rasmussen, patrolman, testified, in substance, as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"I have ridden on car No. 111 of the Manila Electric Rail-road and Light Company; the car was going at a speed of nine points when we timed it on the Luneta just after the car came off Bagumbayan, from post No. 2268 to post 2281, a distance of about 250 meters, and it was going at the speed of 23 miles an hour.\u00a0 It took the car half a minute to run that distance, 250 meters; about that.\"<\/blockquote>O. C. Hall, secret-service agent, testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"I assisted in the timing test of car No. 111 of the Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company on June 19, 1912; I got the motorcycle of the secret-service department, which has a speedometer on it and started from the corner of Bagumbayan and the Luneta, and after the car got around the corner there Mr. Rasmussen gave me the signal, and also I could see the lever from where I was right alongside of the car; I don't know what the time was, I didn't take the time, only what I got from Mr. Rasmussen, but the speedometer on the machine I had showed that the car was going 25 miles an hour while it was on nine points.\"<\/blockquote>A number of witnesses were sworn for the defense.\u00a0 While their testimony tends in some degree to exculpate the accused, it is not in our judgment sufficient to do so.\u00a0 It has nothing of the directness and force of the evidence introduced by the prosecution.\u00a0 It does not meet the proof that Calle Dakota is for a long distance either way from the scene of the accident entirely straight; that the motorman was able to see the child in the street for a long distance; that, although he could not but have seen the child within the limits of the highway, with the possibility, if not probability, that it might place itself upon the track,nevertheless he continued the car at full speed, driving it with the maximum force of the current, without attempting to reduce it to such control that, if the child should chance to go upon the track, he could protect it by stopping the car immediately.<br\/><br\/>It is the duty of any\u00a0 person driving a vehicle in the public thoroughfares to reduce the same to control, ready to be stopped at any moment, if he sees a child below the years of understanding in such place that it can, by any reasonable chance, place itself in a dangerous position with respect to the vehicle.\u00a0 In such case the vehicle must be under such control that, if the child, by some sudden or unexpected movement, places itself in the way of the vehicle, it can be stopped in time to avert injury.\u00a0 No one is able to determine what a child of that age will do, and it is incumbent upon the driver of a vehicle, on seeing such child in the street, to take such care that, no matter what, within reasonable limits, the child may do, it will nevertheless be safe.<br\/><br\/>This defendant, so far as the great preponderance of the evidence is concerned, took no adequate precautions to prevent the accident which occurred.\u00a0 It is undoubted that he saw the child in the street, very probably making its way toward the street-car track; yet he continued the car at its maximum speed, without regard to what the child might do.\u00a0 Such conduct cannot be permitted.\u00a0 Vehicles cannot be driven in the public streets in such a way as to endanger the life of a child below the thinking age who may have strayed upon the streets in search of its mother, or who may be there.for any other reason.\u00a0 Having no judgment of its own, the drivers of vehicles must substitute their judgment for its; not having the intelligence\u00a0 to direct itself, men who drive cars or vehicles must exercise <i>their<\/i> intelligence.\u00a0 It may be true, as defendant claims, that the child by a sudden dart placed itself in front of the car, but that is no excuse for the defendant.\u00a0 He should have anticipated that very thing and should have acted accordingly.<br\/><br\/>We are convinced, under this evidence, that the defendant should have been convicted of the crime of homicide caused by his\u00a0 reckless negligence, as charged in the complaint.\u00a0 Of our authority to convict him here and now of that crime, although he has once been acquitted of it, we do not doubt.\u00a0 (Trono <i>vs<\/i>. The United States, 199 U. S., 521<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup>; Kepner <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 The United States, 195 U. S., 100.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[2]<\/sup>)\u00a0 The crime of which the accused was convicted in the court below is included in the crime of homicide by reckless negligence, as charged and proved in this case.<br\/><br\/>The Penal Code recognizes and distinguishes three classes of negligence in connection with homicide or other crimes:\u00a0 First, reckless negligence, which consists in every act of improvidence (lack of foresight), thoughtlessness, carelessness, negligence, unskillfulness and imprudence, executed or done without taking\u00a0 those precautions or measures which the most common prudence would require.\u00a0 For example, discharging a firearm from the window of one's house and killing a neighbor who just at the moment had leaned over the balcony in front of the house.\u00a0 Leaving a loaded firearm on a chair or other place within the reach of small children then in the house\u2014one of whom picks it up for the purpose\u00a0 of playing with it, and is killed by its discharge.\u00a0 The facts in both of these cases constitute homicide by reckless negligence, because death was produced by failure to exercise the most ordinary and common care.\u00a0 (Viada, Vol. 111, p. 629.)<br\/><br\/>The second class is that in which the act is performed with simple negligence or imprudence, i e., with negligence less than reckless negligence,\u00a0 but at the same time in violation of some ordinance or other rule enacted by some competent body for the public good.\u00a0 An illustration:\u00a0 The superintendent of a jail, in a moment of benevolence and by mere tolerance, permits a prisoner to go out of the jail, who, abusing the confidence and tolerance of the superintendent, escapes.\u00a0 In such case, the superintendent has violated the rules and regulations of jails which prohibit him from permitting a prisoner to leave the jail.\u00a0 The escape of the prisoner, brought about by the superintendent's infraction of the rules, makes him guilty of the crime of infidelity in the custody of prisoners committed by simple imprudence with infraction of the rules relating to prisons.(Id).<br\/><br\/>Finally, the Code recognizes as the third class that in which the negligence can neither be called reckless, because it is impossible to foresee the evil produced, nor negligence with a\u00a0 violation of rules, because in reality no rules are violated.\u00a0 It is called<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> simple <\/span>imprudence or negligence, and is punished as a misdemeanor in paragraph 3 of article 605 (Spanish) of the Penal Code.\u00a0 An example of this class is presented in a case where the driver of a cart, passing along the street at the speed prescribed by the ordinance and leading his team by a strap attached to the bridle or head, in a moment of distraction, on turning a corner, does not see that there is a child asleep in the gutter on the side of the team opposite to him; by reason whereof the child is run over by the cart and killed.\u00a0 The act cannot be denominated purely accidental, because, if he had been paying strict attention to his duty, he would have seen the child and very likely would have been able to avoid the accident.\u00a0 Nor can it be called reckless negligence, because he was not able to foresee the extremely unusual occurrence of a child being asleep in a gutter.\u00a0 Neither\u00a0 was there a violation of an ordinance, because he was driving his vehicle entirely in conformity therewith.\u00a0 Such act is qualified, then, as <i>simple<\/i> imprudence or negligence, punishable as a misdemeanor.\u00a0 (Id.)<br\/><br\/>From these observations, it is apparent that, under the Penal Code, the crime of which the accused was convicted by the trial court is a lesser offense of the crime of homicide committed by reckless negligence of which the accused was acquitted.\u00a0 That being the case, an appeal to this court from a conviction of the lower offense places upon us the duty, and therefore the necessity, of revising the whole case and of taking such action in the premises as law and justice require.\u00a0 (Trono <i>vs<\/i>. The United States, 199\u00a0 U. S.,\u00a0 521; Kepner <i>vs<\/i>. United States, 195 U. S., 100.)<br\/><br\/>We are aware that the crime of homicide through an act of simple negligence which violates an ordinance or regulation is not necessarily included in the crime of homicide through reckless negligence.\u00a0 The latter crime might possibly be committed without the violation of an ordinance or regulation.\u00a0 In that event it would not include the crime of homicide through an act of simple negligence which violates an ordinance or regulation.\u00a0 The courts have not yet gone so far as to hold that, where there is an acquittal of the greater crime and a conviction of a lesser crime <i>not included in the greater and not charged in the information,<\/i> an appeal from a conviction\u00a0 of the lesser crime opens the way to a conviction of the greater crime in the appellate court if the evidence is there found sufficient; nor has there been such holding in a case where two crimes, neither one,included in the other, and from their nature having no legal relation to each other, were charged in the same information, and an acquittal was had as to the higher and a conviction as to the lower.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar, however, we have both the higher and the lower degrees of the same crime charged in the information.\u00a0 We have, also, a case in which the commission of the homicide was accompanied by a violation of the ordinance, and in which, therefore, the crime of homicide through an act of negligence which violates an ordinance was included in the crime of homicide by an act of reckless negligence.\u00a0 This is a case where, as a matter of fact, the one was included in the other.\u00a0 Under the authorities, therefore, an appeal from a conviction of the lower grade opens the whole case for reconsideration by this court upon all the evidence, and requires us in the performance of our duty to pronounce such a judgment in the premises as in conscience we ought.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below is reversed, and the accused is hereby convicted of the crime of homicide committed through reckless negligence, and is hereby sentenced to one year and one day of <i>prision correccional<\/i> with the accessories provided by law, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Loper and Henry M.\u00a0 Jones began before a justice of the peace a proceeding of dispossession against the present plaintiff wherein a judgment was rendered ordering him to vacate said premises, which, acting under the obligation of said judgment, he did; that by reason of his lease with the main defendant and his reliance thereon plaintiff had erected a house of strong materials upon said premises, and\u00a0 that by reason of his dispossession he was obliged to tear down and remove said house to his great damage and expense.\u00a0 The prayer of the complaint is for damages and costs.<br\/><br\/>This action cannot be maintained even though no account be taken of whether or not the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in the sense presented by the demurrer.\u00a0 The action is brought, as will be observed from the title, by Catalino Hilario\u00a0 in representation of Andres Garcia.\u00a0 The complaint alleges:\u00a0 \"That Catalino Hilario, by virtue of a power of attorney executed in the city of Manila on the 31st day of January, 1911, has authority from Andres Garcia to represent him in the present action, and that he resides at No. 239 Calle Magdalena, Trozo, Manila, Philippine Islands.\"<br\/><br\/>It is not contended that the real party in interest, Andres Garcia, is a party to this action, or that he has appeared or taken any part therein or that he has in any manner submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court.\u00a0 A judgment rendered against the plaintiff might have no force or effect against Andres Garcfa.\u00a0 We have several times held that an action brought in this manner cannot be maintained, and this court will, of its own motion, refuse to proceed with its consideration.\u00a0 (Lichauco <i>vs<\/i>.

Rep., 12.)\u00a0 The question of the power of plaintiff to bring the action is raised, at least indirectly, by\u00a0 the demurrer based upon the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u00a0 On its face the complaint shows that there is no cause of action in favor of the plaintiff, but, rather, that the cause of action, if any, exists solely in favor of Andres Garcia.\u00a0 Hilario has no interest in the controversy and stands as a naked representative of the person who does have the interest.\u00a0 The complaint, therefore, does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in favor of the present plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Although this action cannot be maintained by plaintiff, we do not hesitate under the authority of said decision to dispose of the questions raised and argued on the appeal, in order to avoid, possibly, future litigation on the same subject.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer presented by the defendants Loper and Jones, was properly sustained.\u00a0 Certainly no legal liability existed in favor of the plaintiff as against them.\u00a0 All that they did was to bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the plaintiff and, after due trial, secure a judgment against him.\u00a0 The right to bring an action is one which is accorded to every person as against every other and no legal liability can be predicated upon the use of that right unless it has been exercised\u00a0 maliciously and without probable cause.\u00a0 There is no attempt in this case to establish a cause of action for malicious prosecution.\u00a0 The judgment obtained, therefore, protects the defendants, Loper and Jones, in any action brought by the plaintiff in this case founded upon the legal effects of the judgment obtained in that action.\u00a0 Nothing in the complaint intimates that the dispossession of the plaintiff was not the direct, immediate, and necessary result of an execution of the judgment obtained against him.<br\/><br\/>The second question is whether or not the judgment obtained by Loper and Jones against the plaintiff in this case is <i>res judicata<\/i> as to an action of damages by the plaintiff against\u00a0 La Congregacion de San Vicente de Paul for the breach of lease whereby the plaintiff was evicted.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that the action cannot be maintained against the principal defendant for two reasons:\u00a0 In the first place, Loper and Jones were authorized and directed in the contract which they had with the principal defendant to represent the latter and to exercise every right which it could exercise in the dispossession, of all persons upon the said premises, including the plaintiff in this action.\u00a0 In fact, so fully were Loper and Jones representing the principal defendant in the dispossession of the plaintiff in this action that it stood responsible in damages to them in case they, in the exercise of the rights conferred upon them, should fail in the dispossession of all persons occupying the said premises or any part thereof.\u00a0 It is the general rule that, although one is not nominally or formally a party to an action he will be estopped by the judgment therein if he was represented, as to his rights or interests in the subject matter, by a party legally entitled to represent him, or who actually conducted the prosecution or defense on the behalf or for the benefit of said person.\u00a0 (Stout <i>vs<\/i>. Lye,\u00a0 103\u00a0 U. S., 66; Cromwell<i> vs<\/i>. County of Sac, 94 U. S., 351; Pace <i>vs.<\/i> Maiwell, 62 Ga., 97; McNamee <i>vs<\/i>. Moreland, 26 Iowa, 96; Carpenter <i>vs<\/i>. Carpenter, 126 Mich., 217.)<br\/><br\/>This question having once been litigated by Loper and Jones could not be again litigated by the corporation whom they represented, namely, the principal defendant herein.\u00a0 If the action begun by Loper and Jones against the plaintiff in this case had resulted disfavorably to the plaintiffs in that action, a judgment against them would have been binding upon the corporation which they represented, namely, the principal defendant, touching the validity of the lease which the defendant in that action alleged he had with said corporation at the time, when it attempted to lease the lands to Loper and Jones.\u00a0 The question whether or not the plaintiff in this action had a valid and subsisting lease of the premises in question from the principal defendant in this case was completely litigated and disposed of in the action which Loper and Jones began against him for the possession of said lands under authority and power received from; the corporation.\u00a0 Every point and every question necessarily involved in tnat kind of an action was there determined and finally disposed of.\u00a0 No action could thereafter be maintained by either of the parties to that action or their privies for the redetermination of any of those questions.\u00a0 If the defendant in that action had demonstrated and the\u00a0 court had found that he had a valid and subsisting lease with\u00a0 La Congregacion de San Vicente de Paul that judgment would have been binding and conclusive upon said corporation.\u00a0 It could not have again maintained another action against the same defendant to determine the same question.\u00a0 The estoppel was mutual.\u00a0 The defendant therein was estopped from litigating the same question with the corporation that it had litigated with Loper and Jones, its representatives, and the corporation was estopped from litigating with the defendant the same question which its representatives, Loper and Jones, had already litigated with him.<br\/><br\/>If the defendant was not entitled to the possession of the premises, then he had no action for damages against the corporation for his dispossesion.\u00a0 But the right to possession was the very question litigated in that action and it was there found and determined finally that the defendant had no such right.\u00a0 In that action the plaintiffs were fighting not only with their own rights but with the additional express authority of representation with which the congregation had clothed them; they represented the congregation and the congregation was under legal obligation by express provision of the contract to stand responsible for an unfavorable outcome of the litigation.\u00a0 There existed, therefore, between the congregation and Loper and Jones not only a privity in the ordinary acceptation of the word but, in addition, Loper and Jones were the representatives, having interests, of the congregation and were in effect litigating for and on behalf of that corporation as well as themselves.\u00a0 As Loper and Jones were bound by the judgment actually obtained, so was the congregation; and as Loper and Jones would have been bound had the judgment gone against them, so the congregation would likewise have been bound.\u00a0 Therefore, it is but a conclusion to say that the plaintiff in this action is bound by the judgment rendered in the action in which he was defendant, and he is estopped from litigating the same question whether his action be against Loper and Jones or against the congregation.<br\/><br\/>It appearing upon the face of the complaint that the plaintiff was ousted by the execution of a judgment obtained against him in a court of competent jurisdiction, it is apparent, as a necessary legal conclusion, that an action for the recovery of damages resulting from the execution of that judgment cannot be maintained against any party to that judgment or any person with whom they were in privity or whom they were representing.<br\/><br\/>The judgment sustaining the demurrer is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

ADRIANA DE LOS SANTOS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This case is before us <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">en consulta<\/span> from a death penalty imposed upon Adriana de los Santos for the murder of her husband.<br\/><br\/>Agustin Ignacio lived in the barrio of San Roque, municipality of Zamboanga, with his wife, Adriana de los Santos (the defendant in this case) and their live children, aged (about) 17, 14, 7, 6, and 4 years, respectively, the first three being girls and the last two boys.\u00a0 On Sunday night, March 27, 1910, after the family had retired for the night, Ignacio was attacked and fatally wounded with a bolo.\u00a0 After receiving the wounds which caused his death he managed to make his way downstairs and out on the road, where he fell, never to rise again.\u00a0 The justice of the peace arrived about 8 o'clock on Monday morning, March 28. In the meantime the body of the deceased had lain in the street where death had overtaken him and had not been disturbed by anyone.\u00a0 The justice of the peace, on his arrival, conducted an informal investigation at the spot where the body of the deceased was lying and then ordered that the body be taken into the house and washed preparatory to burial . Two days later, on March 30,1910, a formal preliminary investigation was commenced by the justice of the peace and was concluded on April 6. As a result of this investigation Adriana de los Santos was released from custody. On April 28 and 29 the provincial fiscal also conducted an investigation of this crime, following which Vicente Bonifacio was arrested and charged with committing the crime.\u00a0 The charges against Bonifacio were dismissed on December 9 on motion of the fiscal.\u00a0 On August 10 of the same year a criminal complaint was filed by Marcos Bernardo again accusing Adriana de los Santos of the murder of her husband.\u00a0 By virtue of this complaint Adriana was again arrested and on August 11 another preliminary investigation was held in which the two daughters of the deceased testified.\u00a0 The trial in the court below was held the last of November, 1910, and sentence rendered December 12, 1910, some eight or nine months after the crime was committed.<br\/><br\/>The principal witnesses, and whose testimony will be considered in this opinion, are as follows: Adriana de los Santos, wife of the deceased;\u00a0 Apolonia (aged 17) and Maria del Carmen (aged 14), daughters of the deceased and Adriana de }ob Santos; Marcos Bernardo and his wife, Tomasa Iturralde, father and mother of the deceased; Vicente Bonifacio and his wife, Justa Bernardo, the latter being a daughter of Marcos Bernardo and Tomasa Iturralde, and sister of the deceased; Eradio Macoto Cruz and his wife, Marciana de los Santos, niece of the deceased; Alfonso Hipolito, whose wife was an aunt of the defendant, Adriana de los Santos. Marcos Bernardo, Vicente Bonifacio, and Eradio Macoto Cruz and their wives lived together in a house about half an hour's walk from the house of the deceased. Alfonso Hipolito lived about 200 meters from the house of the deceased.<br\/><br\/>At the informal investigation held by the justice of the peace immediately after his arrival at the scene of the murder, four witnesses were examined.\u00a0 None of these witnesses, however, were sworn at the time.\u00a0 Apolonia Ignacio testified first that she was awakened by the sound of her mother and father fighting.\u00a0 Then she stated that about 2 o'clock on the morning of the 28th her mother woke her and after showing her a wound on her arm which she stated her husband had inflicted with a penknife, she seized a bolo and attacked her sleeping husband with it.\u00a0 After he had been wounded her father made his way downstairs and out into the street, where he died. Witness stated that she left the house after seeing her mother attack her father and went to the house of her uncle, Alfonso Hipolito, and told him what had occurred.\u00a0 She stated that the first persons to reach the scene of the crime were Tomasa Iturralde and Alfonso Hipolito; and that when they arrived her father was still alive.\u00a0 She further testified that previous to that night her father and mother had not quarreled, and that neither was intoxicated.\u00a0 Maria, the next eldest daughter, testified that she had not seen her mother attack her father, as she had descended to the lower part of the house with her little brother, who had wakened her by his cries; that when she left the upper part of the house her father was still sleeping, and her mother was seated close to him; that she saw her father descend from the house and walk to the spot where he died in front of the house; that the attack on her father occurred about 12 o'clock that night. She did not know whether her father and mother had been quarreling or not. Alfonso Hipolito testified that Apolonia came to his house about 1 o'clock on Monday morning telling him that her father was wounded, and asking for help; that he went immediately to the house of the deceased, and found Ignacio lying in the street in front of his house wounded; that when he arrived he found the family of the deceased there, and Tomasa Iturralde and Marcos Bernardo; that when he arrived Ignacio was no longer able to talk; that his house was about 200 meters distant from the house of the deceased; that he did not know who had inflicted the wounds.\u00a0 Tomasa Iturralde testified that about 12 o'clock on Sunday night Adriana de los Santos, accompanied by her daughter Apolonia, came to her house and informed her that a misfortune had occurred at her house; that she and her husband immediately accompanied the two back to the house of the deceased, and on arriving in front of the house they found Ignacio lying in the street wounded; that when she came up to Ignacio he asked her to bless him as he was going to die; that she asked him who had wounded him, but that he was not able to reply; that about an hour later he died; that she asked Adriana who had wounded him and she replied that several hours previously the deceased had attacked her with a penknife; so that night when she saw her husband was asleep she took a bolo and attacked him; that she made this statement in the presence of Marcos Bernardo and Alfonso Hipolito.\u00a0 The justice of the peace thereupon ordered the arrest of Adriana de los Santos.<br\/><br\/>The first witness called at the formal investigation conducted by the justice of the peace, which commenced two days later, was the defendant, Adriana de los Santos.\u00a0 She testified that she was 35 years of age. According to her testimony at this time she was sleeping with her husband on the night in question when she was awakened by a noise and looking up saw Vicente Bonifacio striking her husband with a bolo.\u00a0 On seeing this she sprang up and threw her arms around Bonifacio to prevent him from doing her husband further injury, and endeavored to persuade him to leave the house. She then called for help and her two daughters, Apolonia and Maria, were awakened by her cries.\u00a0 At this moment Vicente escaped from the house and ran away.\u00a0 She and her eldest daughter Apolonia then started to go to Tomasa Iturralde for help; that she told Tomasa that her husband had been badly wounded, but did not say by whom; that Tomasa then asked Alfonso Hipolito for help, after which Tomasa and her husband immediately accompanied her back to her home.\u00a0 On the way no further conversation was had.\u00a0 On reaching the scene of the murder the mother of the deceased, Tomasa Iturralde, asked her who had wounded Ignacio.\u00a0 As she had had illicit relations with Vicente Bonifacio for more than a year and wished to avoid the disgrace of having to confess this fact in the presence of her relatives, she replied that she had wounded the deceased; that she told the justice of the peace the same thing that morning and for the same reason.\u00a0 A bolo was produced which she identified as belonging to her husband, and stated that on the night of the murder it was on the lintel of the door and that it was the one Bonifacio had used in making his attack upon the deceased. She stated that the reason her daughters had testified on the morning after the crime that she had killed her husband was that she had instructed them to so testify, as she wished to conceal the fact of her illicit relations with Bonifacio.\u00a0 Upon conclusion of this declaration, Bonifacio was ordered arrested and was immediately apprehended.<br\/><br\/>Vicente Bonifacio testified that he was 30 years of age.\u00a0 According to his testimony, about 1 o'clock that night while he was asleep in the house where he lived with his wife and Eradio Macoto Cruz and his wife, Marcos Bernardo and Martin Enriquez came there and awakened him, asking him to go with them to the house of his brother-in-law, the deceased, who, they stated, had been wounded by his wife.\u00a0 Accompanied by Justa Bernardo (his wife) and Eradio Macoto Cruz, they went to the house of the deceased and found him lying in the street.\u00a0 He stated that he had been in his house from 6 o'clock the preceding evening until he was awakened by Marcos Bernardo.\u00a0 Also, he stated that while he sometimes visited at the house of the deceased he had not been there for two months on account of having to attend to his work.<br\/><br\/>Apolonia Ignacio stated that she was awakened by her mother's cries on that night, and coming out of the room where she had been sleeping saw her father in the outer room wounded; that she did not see who wounded her father; that she and her mother went to the house of Alfonso Hipolito to ask for help, and that when she returned her father was down out of the house; that her mother told her to say it was she who had wounded her husband if anyone asked any questions, and that was why she testified as she did the morning after the crime. This declaration was made on March 30.<br\/><br\/>Eradio Macoto Cruz testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"On Sunday night I was in my house.\u00a0 I did not leave it until 5 o'clock Monday morning, when I went to the house of Agustin Ignacio in company with Vicente Bonifacio, Justa Bernardo, and Marciana de los Santos, my wife, because we were summoned by Maxima Ignacio, who told us that her brother Agustin Ignacio had died.\u00a0 When we arrived there we found Agustin Ignacio dead in the street. I know that the deceased, Agustin Ignacio, was killed because his own wife struck him several blows which caused his death.\u00a0 I know it because his own wife, Adriana de los Santos, told us that she was the one who killed her husband.\u00a0 No other person summoned us except Maxima Ignacio at 5 o'clock on the morning of Monday.\u00a0 I knew about the occurrence from the hour in which we were summoned by Maxima.\u00a0 I live in my house with my wife, Tomasa Iturralde, Marcos Bernardo, Vicente Bonifacio, and Justa Bernardo.\u00a0 Vicente Bonifacio did not leave my house during the night until 5 o'clock in the morning, when he left in company with me and my wife to go to the house of Agustin Ignacio.\u00a0 I slept from 9 o'clock at night until 5 o'clock in the morning.\u00a0 The truth is, I do not know whether Vicente Bonifacio left my house or not during the night.\u00a0 When Maxima arrived at our house to summon us, my wife, Vicente Bonifacio, and Justa Bernardo were there. Marcos Bernardo and Tomasa Iturralde had gone to the house of the deceased, Agustin Ignacio, at 12 o'clock that night because they were summoned by Adriana de los Santos, who said that the misfortune had occurred at her house.\u00a0 I heard Adriana, de los Santos say to Tomasa Iturralde and Marcos Bernardo that a misfortune had occurred at her house. The truth is, that I knew about this matter at 12 o'clock that night and what I stated before was not true.\"<\/blockquote>Marcos Bernardo testified that on the Sunday night preceding the murder he was in his house from 6 o'clock in the evening; that at 8 o'clock he went to sleep and was awakened by Adriana, who told him that a misfortune had occurred in her house; that he and his wife accompanied her home and on arriving there found Ignacio in the street in front of the house wounded; that he asked Ignacio who had wounded him, and the latter replied that it was Bonifacio.\u00a0 Witness's wife Tomasa was present at the time.\u00a0 Witness, on being informed that Bonifacio had wounded the deceased, went to tell the justice of the peace.\u00a0 On his return he found that Ignacio had died. He stated that he, his wife, Eradio Macoto Cruz, Marciana de los Santos, Vicente Bonifacio, and Justa Bernardo lived together; that about 9 o'clock on Sunday night, Bonifacio left the house and did not return; that Bonifacio was not there when Adriana called them; that he first saw Bonifacio after the murder at 8 o'clock on Monday at the house of the deceased; that Eradio saw Bonifacio depart from the house on Sunday evening.<br\/><br\/>Justa Bernardo, wife of Vicente Bonifacio, testified that she lived in the house of Eradio Macoto Cruz with her father, mother, and husband, and Marciana de los Santos; that she was awakened about 12 o'clock Sunday night by Adriana, who called to her father Marcos Bernardo, saying that a misfortune had occurred in her house; that her father and mother left the house in company with Adriana; that when Adriana arrived at their house Bonifacio was not there, he having left about 9 o'clock the previous evening. She stated that she first saw Bonifacio about 5 o'clock on Monday morning in the house of Adriana; and that Eradio Macoto Cruz saw Bonifacio leave the house on Sunday evening.<br\/><br\/>Tomasa Iturralde, 42 years of age, testified that about midnight Adfiana came to their house and called her, saying that there had been a misfortune in her house, and she immediately left with her husband to accompany Adriana back to her house.\u00a0 On arriving at Adriana's house she saw her son Agustin lying wounded in the street near the house; that he asked her to kiss his hand, as he was going to die; that she blessed him and then asked him who had wounded him and he replied that it was Bonifacio; that he then told her husband Bernardo the same thing; that after saying these words Ignacio lost the power of speech and two hours later at what she thinks was about 2 o'clock he died; that she lived in a house with her husband, Eradio Macoto Cruz, Marciana de los Santos, Vicente Bonifacio, and Justa Bernardo; that on arriving at the house of Adriana the latter told her that Bonifacio had killed the deceased; that the daughters of Adriana also told her the same thing; that at the informal investigation held early in the morning after the crime she was so agitated that she did not know what she said then to the justice of the peace.\u00a0 She stated that Bonifacio was not in the house when Adriana called them, he having left about 9 o'clock the previous evening, and not returned.<br\/><br\/>Apolonia Ignacio was again placed on the stand and testified that about midnight she was awakened and coming out of the room where she had been sleeping she saw Vicente Bonifacio attacking her father with a bolo and saw her mother embrace Ignacio; on seeing this she left the house and went to the house of Tomasa Iturralde, her mother following her; that when she left the house Bonifacio and her father were both still upstairs, but that when she returned her father was lying in the street; that she testified differently in the first investigation because her mother told her to, but that the truth of the matter was that she herself saw Bonifacio attacking her father with a bolo; that her sister Maria del Carmen also saw Bonifacio making the assault on her father.<br\/><br\/>Maria del Carmen Ignacio, the second daughter of the deceased, testified that about 9 o'clock on Sunday night while she and her little brother were seated on a bench in the house Bonifacio came in.\u00a0 Her father was then asleep and her mother was seated close beside him.\u00a0 Bonifacio seated himself and after a little time arose and taking her father's bolo from its place above the door unsheathed it and attacked her father with it.\u00a0 On seeing this she ran from the house, crying for help. As she was going downstairs her sister Apolonia awoke and also saw what occurred to her father. Her mother saw Bonifacio make the attack on her father with the bolo, but she and Bonifacio had no conversation.\u00a0 She stated that her mother had instructed her to testify differently in the first investigation.<br\/><br\/>Justa Bernardo, recalled, testified that it was about 5 o'clock in the morning when they started for the house of Adriana; that the party consisted of herself, Marciana de los Santos, and Eradio Macoto Cruz; that Bonifacio was not there when they started.\u00a0 She here identified a pair of blood-stained trousers as belonging to her husband, and stated that she found these trousers on a bench in their house on April 1; that she did not return to her house until April 1, and that she saw these trousers immediately on her return; that on leaving the house that evening Bonifacio wore the same trousers which were before the court; that on arriving at th6 house of Adriana, Bonifacio was already there; that he then wore the same trousers; that upon her arrival at the house of Adriana, Bonifacio started to return to their house; that she noted the stains on the trousers of Bonifacio when she saw him early that morning in Adriana's house; that these stains were not there Sunday evening when he left the house.\u00a0 This declaration was made on April 2, 1910.<br\/><br\/>On the 5th of April Adriana de los Santos was recalled and testified that after Vicente had left the house, her daughter\u00a0 Apolonia left, and after her she (witness) followed, with the object of going for help, and went in the direction of Tomasa's house; that she went by the road that led to that house, but thinking that Bonifacio would also take that road she went instead to the house of Alfonso Hipolito and met Tomasa and her husband in front of that house; that she asked them to come with her immediately, as her husband was badly wounded; that on arrival at her house, Tomasa asked her who had wounded Ignacio and with the object of avoiding further disgrace because her relatives were present she stated that it was she; that she told the justice of the peace when he arrived that morning that she had killed her husband because she was afraid that there would be another misfortune.<br\/><br\/>On April 6 Marciana de los Santos was called to the stand.\u00a0 She testified that while she was in her house on Sunday night Adriana came there; that she heard Adriana tell Tomasa that there had been a misfortune in her house and ask for aid; that while this conversation was going on Adriana was below in the street and Tomasa was in the house; that she heard Adriana tell Tomasa that Ignacio was badly wounded, but that she did not say by whom; that Tomasa and Marcos Bernardo accompanied Adriana to her house; that she saw Adriana alone in the street; that there lived in her house her husband (Eradio Macoto Cruz), Tomasa Iturralde, and Justa Bernardo; that she went to the scene of the crime for the purpose of seeing her uncle; that she found her uncle dead in the street in front of the house; that she knew who had committed the crime because Adriana told her that it was Bonifacio; that Adriana told her this on the moment of her arrival at the latter's house; that she remained in the house of Adriana from 5 o'clock that morning until 9 o'clock at night, Tuesday; that during this time she held no further conversation with Adriana She here identified the blood-stained trousers as those Bonifacio wore when he left the house on Sunday evening.<br\/><br\/>Tomasa Iturralde, recalled, testified that she was in her house when Adriana called on her for help; that Adriana merely told her there had been a misfortune in her house; that she and her husband immediately left with Adriana; that they held no further conversation until they arrived at Adriana's house; that upon their arrival there she asked Adriana who had wounded Ignacio and Adriana replied that it was Bonifacio; that that was all Adriana told her; that no one was present when Adriana told her that Bonifacio had wounded Ignacio.<br\/><br\/>Justa Bernardo, recalled, again said she stayed in Adriana's house from Monday morning at 5 o'clock until noon of Tuesday; that during that time she had had no conversation with Adriana de los Santos.<br\/><br\/>Marcos Bernardo, recalled, testified that he was in his house when Adriana came asking for help; that she merely told them there had been a misfortune at her house; that no further conversation was held until they reached the scene of the crime; that it was about half an hour's walk from his house to Adriana's house; that on arriving\" at the latter place he and his wife asked Adriana who had wounded Ignacio and she replied that it was Bonifacio, that he had no further conversation with Adriana.\u00a0 The justice of the peace thereupon ordered the release of Adriana de los Santos.\u00a0 This was on April 6, 1910.<br\/><br\/>In the investigation conducted by the justice of the peace on August 11, Apolonia Ignacio testified that about 12 o'clock on the night of the murder she was awakened by hearing her mother crying; that her mother ordered her and her sister to go downstairs, telling them that if they did not go she would kill them; that at that time their mother had a bolo in her hands; that after getting downstairs she heard her mother striking her father with a bolo, but did not hear anyone talking1 upstairs or hear her father cry out at all; that she then saw her mother come downstairs followed by her father, who was bleeding profusely; that her father got as far as the road where he fell down without saying a word; that her mother then took her to the house of Tomasa Iturralde to ask for help; that on returning to their house with Tomasa Iturralde and Marcos Bernardo, Tomasa approached Ignacio and the latter asked her to bless him as he was going to die; that these were the only words which the deceased spoke; that Marcos Bernardo did not go near or speak to the deceased, but on arriving at the scene of the crime and seeing Ignacio lying there wounded he went immediately to the house of Alfonso Hipolito for assistance; that the reason she had stated before that Vicente Bonifacio assaulted her father was that her mother and one Jacinto Marquez, a sergeant of the municipal police force, had induced her to do so by threats; that Marquez had threatened her in the court of the justice of the peace in moments when that official was downstairs.<br\/><br\/>Maria del Carmen Ignacio, the second daughter of the deceased, then testified. She stated that she and her sister were awakened by their mother crying; that their mother then ordered them to go downstairs; that she replied that she did not wish to do so, whereupon her mother told them if they did not go downstairs she would kill them; that as they were going downstairs their mother seized a bolo and very soon afterwards she heard the sound of blows.\u00a0 Then she saw her mother come downstairs carrying the bolo and her father followed her as far as the road, where he fell down and her mother and Apolonia went in the direction of her grandmother's house for help; that she testified previously that Bonifacio had killed her father through fear of her mother and Jacinto Marquez.\u00a0 Upon the conclusion of this declaration Adriana de los Santos was remanded for trial before the Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>In the Court of First Instance Maria del Carmen testified that she was sleeping beside her father and mother when her mother awakened her saying, \"I am going to die;\" that her mother ordered her to get a <i>buyo<\/i> box, which she did; that she then went into the room where her sister was sleeping and awakened her, after which the two went down stairs; that there was a lamp burning in the room; that her mother did not have a bolo in her hands when she (witness) went downstairs; that she could see her mother from underneath the house striking her father with a bolo, because the cracks in the floor were large. Witness was very positive on this point. She stated that her father said nothing; that after the attack her mother came downstairs followed by her father; that she noted the expression on her mother's face, although she was 5 meters distant; that her mother appeared to be angry; that her mother had a bolo in her hands.as she came downstairs; that after her father fell in the road her mother and sister went to Tomasa's house for help; that her mother took the bolo with her; that when Tomasa arrived Ignacio asked her to bless him, but could not reply when she asked him who had wounded him. She was unable to state, even with reasonable accuracy, who was present when her father died, at one time saying Vicente Bonifacio and Justa Bernardo were there. She stated that Bonifacio, Justa Bernardo, Marciana de los Santos, and Maxima Ignacio arrived at 5 o'clock Monday morning; that Bonifacio's trousers were stained with the blood of the deceased while he was helping to carry the body into the house; that Bonifacio carried the head, Eligio the body, and Juan the feet; that blood was dripping from the head; that Bonifacio sent his wife to their home to get some clean clothes and that he changed his clothes in her house and delivered the soiled ones to Jacinto Marquez in her presence. She denied having told the fiscal during the investigation which the latter made that Bonifacio had killed her father, but the fiscal testified that she had told him this.\u00a0 She stated that she had been influenced to testify before the justice of the peace that Bonifacio had killed her father by Jacinto Marquez, but was unable to say whether he had talked with her before or after she had testified in the court of the justice of the peace. She stated that Jacinto threatened her with six months imprisonment in the jail; that he told her what to say and made these threats in the court room of the justice of the peace while she, her sister, and he were seated on a bench; and that Tomasa Iturralde and Justa Bernardo were in the room at the time.\u00a0 She also stated that she forgot to tell the fiscal during his investigation that Marquez had influenced her testimony before the justice of the peace.\u00a0 She further stated that she and her sister had remained under the house for two hours while her father was being attacked by her mother upstairs.\u00a0 Then she stated that her father had told Tomasa on her arrival that Adriana had wounded him.<br\/><br\/>Apolonia, the eldest daughter of the deceased, was the next witness to testify. She first told the court that she was 14 years of age, but after further questioning stated that she was 17 years of age. She testified that on the night in question she was sleeping with two of the small children in a room which was separated from the room where her father and mother and sister Maria were sleeping by a partition which did not reach to the ceiling; that she was awakened by the weeping of her mother; that her mother was making considerable noise; that her mother had a bolo in her hands; that she was seated within half a meter of her father; that her mother told them, \"Go downstairs because I am going to run amuck;\" that when they went downstairs her father was still asleep; that she could see her mother attacking her father through the cracks in the floor; that there were many cracks in the floor from 1<sup>1\/3<\/sup> to 2 inches wide; that her mother was standing up then; that she saw her father get up and try to defend himself; that he cried out, \"Ay, Adriana, what are you doing to me?\u00a0 Are you pouring hot water on me?;\" that her mother descended first and then her father; that their mother then took her and went to the house of Tomasa for\u00a0 help; that her mother carried the bolo she had used to the house of Tomasa; that her mother simply told Tomasa that there had been a misfortune at her house; that she did not tell them anything more; that while she was telling Tomasa this, Bonifacio, Marciana, and Eradio appeared at the door; that Bonifacio closed the door as her grandparents left the house; that as they were returning to the house of the deceased Tomasa took the bolo from Adriana and asked her who had wounded Ignacio, and that her mother said it was she; that on arriving at where her father was lying the latter said nothing except to ask Tomasa to bless him; that after her father had died she and her grandfather Marcos Bernardo went to tell Hipolito (Hipolito says in both his declarations that the victim was still alive when he arrived); that Bonifacio arrived the next morning at 5 o'clock; that while she was testifying before the justice of the peace, Bonifacio and two others carried the body upstairs; that the body was placed on a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">petate<\/span>; that blood was dripping from the head, which was the part Bonifacio carried; that after they had carried the body upstairs she noted that Bonifacio's trousers were stained with blood; that while the body was being carried upstairs she was making her declaration before the justice of the peace; that she was still testifying when Vicente came downstairs; that she did not notice whether his shirt was stained or not, that Bonifacio did not change his clothes in their house. She stated that on Sunday evening from supper time until bedtime her parents had passed the time pleasantly together as usual; that her parents always got along well together; that she could not remember of ever having heard them quarrel.\u00a0 She first denied that she had told the fiscal during his investigation about two weeks after the murder how her father had died, but admitting one thing after another she finally stated that she had told him Vicente Bonifacio had killed her father, but that it was due to the threats of her mother and Marquez; that Marquez had threatened her on Wednesday, March 30; that this was in the court room of the justice of the peace during the absence of the justice; that no one was present at the time but herself, her mother, and Jacinto.\u00a0 Previously she stated positively that no one but her mother had influenced her testimony before the justice of the peace. She first insisted that the last time she had talked with her mother was when the latter told her that if anyone asked her who had killed her father to say that it was her mother who had done it.\u00a0 She denied absolutely having talked with her mother subsequent to that time.\u00a0 Finally she admitted that while she and her mother were living with her aunt for several weeks she had talked with her mother.\u00a0 She stated that she did not understand what was in the declaration which she signed before the justice of the peace, because he talked to her in the Spanish language; but the justice says he talked in the native dialect.<br\/><br\/>Tomasa Iturralde testified that it was about 12 o'clock when Adriana came to their house telling them that there had been a misfortune at her house; that she did not inquire what was wrong; that Adriana then carried a bolo; that she and her husband went with Adriana; that when they reached the place where the victim was lying, she embraced him and at his request blessed him; that the victim was not able to say anything more; that after he had died she asked Adriana who had killed him, and Adriana replied that she had done it while he was asleep; that Bonifacio was in the house when Adriana called her and her husband; that he was asleep at the time, but that she awakened him before leaving and told him not to leave the house on account of the children; that he remained and did not come to the house of the deceased until the next morning at about 5 o'clock; that the body of the deceased was placed on a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">petate<\/span> and carried into the house, Vicente carrying the shoulders, Eligio the middle, and Juan the feet; that there was much blood coming from the wounds at the time; that the reason she had testified differently before the justice of the peace was that her daughter-in-law Adriana and Jacinto Marquez had threatened her with six years' imprisonment in Bilibid if she did not follow the story of Adriana; that her deceased son and his wife had always lived together in peace because her son was a good worker.<br\/><br\/>Marcos Bernardo testified that when they reached the house of the victim he was still alive, but had lost the power of speech; that Tomasa, his wife, asked Adriana who had wounded Ignacio, and she replied, \"I, myself;\" that Bonifacio was at home all of the night of the murder; that he testified falsely before the justice of the peace because Marquez threatened him with six years' imprisonment if he did not do so; that Marquez was interested in the case because he wished to obtain the two daughters of Adriana de los Santos.<br\/><br\/>Justa Bernardo testified that her father and mother awakened her on Sunday night saying that they were going to the house of Ignacio because there had been a misfortune there; that she, her husband Bonifacio, Marciana de los Santos, Eradio Macoto Cruz, and Maxima ignacio went to the house of the deceased about 5 o'clock in the morning; that Bonifacio was in the house all night; that on arriving at the house she asked her mother (Tomasa) who had assaulted her brother and her mother replied that it was Adriana; that she testified falsely before the justice of the peace because she was excited and because Marquez forced her to. Recalled, she stated that the blood-stained trousers exhibited belonged to her husband; that the stains were from the blood dripping from the body as Bonifacio was assisting in carrying it into the house,<br\/><br\/>Eradio Macoto Cruz testified that he arrived at the house of the deceased at 5 o'clock in the morning, in company with his wife, Bonifacio and his wife, and Maxima (Ignacio); that he heard Maxima ask Adriana who had killed Ignacio and Adriana replied that it was she; that Bonifacio had remained in the house all of Sunday night,<br\/><br\/>Marciana de los Santos testified that Bonifacio was at home all that night; that her grandmother awoke her and the rest because they were going to accompany Adriana de los Santos; that Adriana arrived at 12 o'clock and called Tomasa and Marcos, saying \"<i>Inay, Tay<\/i>! Come with me because there has been a misfortune in my house;\" that Adriana did not say what kind of a misfortune had occurred; that at 5 o'clock the next morning Bonifacio went with her and the rest of the inmates of that house to the scene of the crime; that she heard her mother Maxima ask Adriana who had killed Ignacio and Adriana replied that she had done it while he was asleep; that Jacinto Marquez caused her to swear falsely before the justice of the peace by threatening her with imprisonment for six years.<br\/><br\/>Edilberto Enriquez testified that in the months of July and August, 1910, he was a clerk in the office of the provincial fiscal and overheard Adriana de los Santos tell the fiscal that she had had illicit relations with Bonifacio for more than a year; that her youngest child was Bonifacio's; and that three days before the death of, her husband she and Bonifacio held a conversation in which the latter told her that if she did not have a husband he, Bonifacio, would leave his wife and live with her.<br\/><br\/>Julian Garcia, the justice of the peace who conducted the preliminary investigations, was called as a witness, first by the prosecution, then by the defense, and finally by the court.\u00a0 So his testimony may as well be considered altogether.\u00a0 This witness stated' that during the night he was awakened by one Marcos Climaco Bernardo and another, who told him that there was a man wounded in the sitio of Oac (referring to the deceased).\u00a0 He did not go at once to the scene of the crime, as he did not understand that the wounds were serious.\u00a0 He arrived at the scene of the crime the next morning at about 8 o'clock.\u00a0 There were some eight or ten persons present.\u00a0 Upon his\" arrival he addressed these persons generally, asking who had killed the deceased. Adriana de los Santos replied, saying that she had done it, giving as her reason that during the night she and her husband had a quarrel during which he had threatened to kill her; so she waited until he was asleep and then attacked him with the bolo.\u00a0 The justice of the peace stated that she spoke these words in a somewhat low voice and with some emotion; and that she appeared to have been crying.\u00a0 He stated that the body appeared to be rigid, the wounds appeared to be fresh and somewhat moist, and the blood had apparently coagulated.\u00a0 He remained on the scene about an hour and ordered the body taken in to the house just as he was leaving, but did not see this done.\u00a0 He stated that he had not observed the clothing of the accused nor did he notice that the relatives of the family regarded her with aversion.\u00a0 She appeared to be a very ignorant person.\u00a0 He could not say whether Bonifacio was there at the time or not; but stated that he had not seen him.\u00a0 After the presentation of this witness the prosecution rested.<br\/><br\/>Jacinto Marquez, called by the defense, denied having used threats against any of the witnesses for the prosecution.\u00a0 He stated that the justice of the peace had asked him to make an investigation of the case, as it appeared to him that everything was not well.\u00a0 Taken as a whole, the testimony of this witness is far from satisfactory.\u00a0 He claimed to have arrested Bonifacio and to have been the one who found the blood-stained trousers in Bonifacio's house; he accompanied the fiscal to the scene of the murder and was present at that investigation. Notwithstanding all this he was ignorant of names, not being able to recall even the name of Bonifacio, although he later admitted that he knew some of the witnesses for the prosecution.\u00a0 He heard Adriana state immediately after being taken to the jail that she had killed her husband; he took her to a lawyer at her request; the whole family had dinner at his house one day during the first investigation by the justice of the peace, during which Adriana told him privately that Bonifacio had killed her husband.\u00a0 Yet he professed to know very little about the progress or details of the case.\u00a0 The justice of the peace stated that he had seen him in the court room occasionally during the progress of the investigation, which was nothing out of the ordinary, and that he had not noted that Marquez displayed any unusual interest in the case; and that he had not asked Marquez to help him investigate the case.\u00a0 While we do not believe there is any trustworthy evidence in the record showing that this witness exerted himself at any time to induce the witnesses for the prosecution to implicate Bonifacio, we must conclude that this man, although an officer of the municipal police force, was at least suppressing if not subverting what he knew to be the real facts of the case.<br\/><br\/>Miguel Luculan, clerk, testified that in March, 1910, he was chief of police; that on the arrest of Adriana de los Santos the morning after the murder the justice of the peace informed him that she had committed the crime of parricide; that that evening a health inspector came to the jail and stated that the wounds on the body of the deceased were too serious to have been inflicted by a woman, and that he had been sent there to investigate by the health officer.\u00a0 (It may here be stated that there appears in the record a report made by Major Clayton, United States Army, at that time health officer of Zamboanga, in which the wounds on the body\u2014seventeen in number\u2014are described.)\u00a0 This witness further stated that after the health inspector had talked with Adriana the latter said he was of the opinion that her statement that she had killed her husband was not true; that he (witness) then went and talked with her; that she then told him that the guilty person was Bonifacio; that he made a note of this name and told the justice of the peace about it the next day; that Jacinto Marquez accompanied the fiscal and himself to the scene of the crime at the time the fiscal made his investigation; that at that time Adriana and her two daughters showed exactly how the crime had occurred, stating that Bonifacio had committed it; that he did not notice Marquez making threats or promises to the witnesses; that Marquez accompanied the fiscal and him back to Zamboanga.\u00a0 Marquez testified that Adriana had informed him in the police station the morning after her arrest that she had killed her husband.\u00a0 But this witness stated that he never saw Marquez talking to the defendant while she was in jail at that time.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Gibbons, assistant prosecuting attorney, who conducted the investigations of that office, testified that on April 28 he conducted an investigation in his office, and that it not being satisfactory he requested permission from his superior to go to the scene of the murder to make an investigation on the ground; that the following day, accompanied by Jacinto Marquez, a secret service man, and the chief of police, he went to the house of the deceased and held an investigation there; that by arrangement, the principal witnesses for the prosecution were there at that time; that the investigation was conducted upstairs and that the witnesses were called up one by one and testified in the presence of himself and his two assistants, no other persons being in the room; that at that time the defendant testified that she was sleeping on the floor with her husband when she was awakened by cries and saw Vicente Bonifacio striking her husband with a bolo; that her husband arose and fell in another place, Bonifacio all the time striking him with the bolo; that she tried to save her husband and then caught Bonifacio by the arms, when the latter threw the bolo to the floor and ran out of the house; that she told him then that the reason she had stated to the justice on the morning after the murder that she had killed her husband was because she did not want everybody to know that she had had illicit relations with Bonifacio, especially in the presence of her relatives, and that she had instructed her daughters to tell the same story for the same reason.\u00a0 Witness testified that Apolonia and Maria stated the day previously in his office that Bonifacio was the perpetrator of the crime, and that in the investigation at the house they told the same story, and represented exactly how the crime had been committed; that they stated the reason they had once testified that it was their mother who was guilty of the crime was that she had instructed them to so testify; that they testified before him under oath; that Tomasa Iturralde testified that she did not know who had killed the deceased but that she had suspicions of who the perpetrator was; that she testified only on the question of where Bonifacio was on that night; that he asked her who was the guilty party and that according to his recollection she replied that she had heard no declaration of guilt but that she suspected it was Bpnifacio.\u00a0 He stated that according to his recollection the house was new, less than a year old, and that the cracks in the floor were very narrow, and estimated their width at one-eighth of an inch.\u00a0 He stated that on July 10 he made another investigation, at which time he examined the same witnesses; that on that occasion the two daughters of the deceased testified positively that their mother had committed the crime; that he himself had requested Jacinto Marquez to accompany him on April 29 to the house of the deceased; that Marquez acted as his interpreter part of the time, the chief of police also assisting in this capacity; that he did not notice Marquez taking any unusual interest in the case.<br\/><br\/>Alfonso Hipolito, called by the court after both the prosecution and the defense had rested, testified that Apolonia and Marcos Bernardo came to his house about 12 o'clock that night, asking for help; that he went with them immediately; that when he arrived at the house he found there Tomasa Iturralde and Adriana de los Santos and her daughter Maria; that the deceased was then unable to talk; that he and Marcos Bernardo then went to inform the justice of the peace; that Apolonia did not tell him who had wounded her father when she came asking for help, and that he did not ask her; that he made no inquiries, as to who had committed the murder, and heard nothing at all about it.<br\/><br\/>As counterproof, the defense introduced the defendant, Adriana de Jos Santos.\u00a0 She stated that about four years previous to the murder, during a six months' absence of her husband from their home, Bonifacio commenced to have illicit intercourse with her; that her youngest son, 4 years of age, was Bonifacio's; that after her husband returned and until they moved into their new house about a year previous to the murder, these illicit relations had ceased; that after moving into this house she and Bonifacio had resumed their adulterous intimacy; that about two days before the1 murder, Bonifacio told her that if she did not have a husband he would leave his wife and live with her; that on the evening of the night preceding the night of the murder Bonifacio had come to the house and had carnal intercourse with her before Ignacio had returned from work; that when her husband came she told him about it and her husband ordered her not to permit Bonifacio to enter the house in his absence; that when Bonifacio came on the evening of the night of the murder she told him about this order; that Bonifacio became angry.and said that since she and her husband had moved into their new house they had become very proud, and that he would come up anyway; that on leaving that night he stated he would return later to speak to her husband; that she asked him what he was going to say to her husband, but that he did not reply; that she was awakened by the sound of the attack Bonifacio was making on her husband; that she sprang up and commenced to struggle with Bonifacio for the possession of the bolo, during which struggle she received a cut on the arm (here showing the court a scar); that after she had succeeded in wresting the bolo from Bonifacio he left the house; that her daughters saw him while he was attacking her husband; that she and her daughter Apolonia then started for the house of Tomasa for help; that she did not carry the bolo with her but left it in the house; that they met Tomasa and her husband on the road near the house of Alfonso Hipolito; that although this was such an unusual hour to be out, she thought nothing of it as Tomasa was a midwife; that she returned with Tomasa about half an hour after she had left her home; that on reaching her husband, Tomasa Iturralde asked him who had attacked him and he replied Bonifacio; that Marcos Bernardo and her two daughters were present and heard this statement of her husband; that Bonifacio returned shortly thereafter and told her that if she did not state that it was she who killed her husband he would kill her; that Bonifacio was not there when the justice of the peace came, but that she told the justice of the peace that she was the guilty person because his family were around her and because Eligio Ignacio was making inquiries and she did not wish him to attempt to revenge the death of her husband; that Justa Bernardo, Eradio Macoto Cruz, and Marciana de los Santos arrived at the house about 3 o'clock in the morning; that she had never told anyone before about the threats of Bonifacio; that when she testified before the fiscal she forgot to tell him about this.<br\/><br\/>The two children, aged 6 and 7, were also called by the defense, but their testimony cannot be considered because, as stated by the trial court, they had not yet arrived at the age of discernment and their testimony strongly indicated that they had been taught what to say.<br\/><br\/>Vicente Bonifacio was called as counterproof by the prosecution. He denied that he even knew what the occupation of the deceased had been. He stated that the first and only time he had ever been in the house of the deceased up to the time of the murder was on the morning1 after the deceased had been killed. Later he was able to describe the house of the deceased generally, and the distance to the nearest neighbor's house.\u00a0 He stated that the body was carried into the house upon the conclusion of the testimony of the girl Apolonia; that it was not first placed on a petate; that he changed the blood-stained trousers in his own house.\u00a0 He stated that his testimony before the justice of the peace that he had occasionally visited the house of the deceased and that Marcos Bernardo and another had called him to go to the scene of the murder was false.<br\/><br\/>The foregoing rather extended review of the evidence in this case has been rendered necessary by the amazing contradictions in the testimony of the principal witnesses, to be found on practically every page of their testimony.<br\/><br\/>It will be noted from the foregoing that two general theories of the crime have been developed.\u00a0 One is that Adriana de los Santos waited until her husband was asleep and then attacked him with a bolo, inflicting the wounds which caused his death.\u00a0 The other is that Vicente Bonifacio left his hpme early on the night of the murder and entered the house of the deceased while the family was sleeping and assaulted the deceased.\u00a0 Both of these hypotheses are supported by testimony of record. Either, to the exclusion of the other, would doubtless be acceptable upon which to base a judgment of conviction.<br\/><br\/>That the two daughters of the deceased, his mother and father, his sister Justa, and his niece Marciana, knew to a certainty who was the perpetrator of the crime before any of their various declarations of record were taken, we have not the slightest doubt. We are of this opinion from the fact that the two daughters of the deceased were necessarily eyewitnesses of the crime, while the others arrived there within such a short time after its commission that they evidently obtained sufficient information of the crime and the motive therefor to expose the guilty person. If we can accept the joint declarations of these se witnesses that Jacinto Marquez, by threats of imprisonment, induced them to accuse Bonifacio of the murder, our task will be greatly simplified. In that case the more serious contradictions in the testimony of these witnesses will be explained away, and that fact established, will react upon the defendant as an added indication of her guilt.\u00a0 It is therefore necessary to first determine whether there is any merit in the charge that Jacinto Marquez intimidated these witnesses and compelled them, through fear of imprisonment, to accuse Bonifacio of the crime in the preliminary investigations at which they testified to that effect.<br\/><br\/>A mere perusal of the testimony taken at the first formal investigation conducted by the justice of the peace, which commenced two days after the crime was committed, shows that every one of these witnesses contradicted the accused on a material point: that is, that Adriana found Tomasa and her husband in their house' when she went to ask their assistance, and not in front of the house of Hipolito as stated by Adriana. Not only this, but Tomasa Iturralde and Marcos Bernardo were recalled expressly to testify upon this point after the defendant had. stated that she found them in the road in front of Hipolito's house, and flatly contradicted this statement, insisting that Adriana found them in their own house, where they had been all night: and Marciana de los Santos, who did not testify at all until after the defendant had made the above statement, also declared that Adriana came to their house on the night in question and called Tomasa and Marcos Bernardo.\u00a0 The defendant stated in this investigation that she was awakened by hearing the noise of the assault which Bonifacio was making upon her husband. In the same investigation, Maria testified that Bonifacio came to the house after her father was asleep and while she was sitting on a bench and her mother was sitting near her sleeping husband; that Bonifacio seated himself and after a while deliberately took the bolo from its,place on the wall and commenced attacking her father.\u00a0 In the same investigation Apolbnia testified first that she did not see who wounded her father and later that she saw Bonifacio assaulting her father with the bolo.\u00a0 That these inconsistencies between the statements of the defendant and these witnesses are material cannot be questioned.\u00a0 Had these witnesses testified under the fear of imprisonment as claimed by them, it is incredible that they would have had the temerity to contradict the story of the accused upon such important points. Again, Marquez testified that he knew none of the witnesses for the prosecution prior to the date of the murder.\u00a0 This testimony is not disputed by them. These same witnesses testified that he threatened them in the courtroom of the justice of the peace while the trial was actually in progress, at odd moments when the justice was downstairs. When the investigation was suspended on March 31, all of these witnesses had testified accusing Bonifacio of the crime.\u00a0 As the investigation started the day before, this means that a total stranger, in the few moments at his disposal during these two days, when the justice was absent from the room, had succeeded in influencing these witnesses to tell a story which they knew to be absolutely untrue.\u00a0 And further that Marquez had the audacity to carry on this dangerous business under the nose of the justice.\u00a0 But we must go still further in order to accept the explanation of ttfese witnesses as to why they accused Bonifacio as the murderer, for one month later they again testified, this time before the provincial fiscal, that Bonifacio was the guilty person. Could threats of <i>imprisonment<\/i> by a sergeant of municipal police have induced these witnesses, on two different occasions thirty days apart, to testify so at variance with what each andall of them knew to be the truth of the matter? Credulity itself would not accept such a story.\u00a0 That such a fear should effectually seal the lips of six witnesses, all of whom had the most perfect personal liberty, for a period of more than one month, during which time they saw the guilty party set free while an innocent man, by reason of their false declarations, was suffering unmerited imprisonment, and they, in the meantime, repeating under oath these same untrue statements, is not by any means within the bounds of ordinary human conduct.<br\/><br\/>Apolonia testified three times that her mother killed the deceased.\u00a0 The first time she started out by saying that she was awakened by the sound of her father and mother fighting.\u00a0 In the same breath she.stated that her mother awoke her and after showing her a wound on her arm which she stated her husband had inflicted with a penknife, she seized a bolo and attacked her sleeping husband with it.\u00a0 She also stated that she went to the house of Alfonso Hipolito for help.\u00a0 Before the justice of the peace on August 11 she stated that she was awakened by hearing her mother crying, and that after the assault on her father her mother took her to the house of Tomasa Iturralde for help. In this same investigation she testified that she <i>heard<\/i> her mother attacking her father and that no one said anything or made any outcry during the assault.\u00a0 In the Court of First Instance she testified that she <i>saw<\/i> her mother attacking her father through the cracks in the floor (stating that there were many from 1 1\/3 to 2 inches wide), describing how her father got up and tried to defend himself; and that he cried out:\u00a0 \"Ay, Adriana, what are you doing to me?\u00a0 Are you pouring hot water on me?\" Maria del Carmen testified three times that her mother was the guilty person.\u00a0 She testified in the first investigation that her little brother awakened her by his cries.\u00a0 On August 11 she testified that it was her mother's crying that had awakened her.\u00a0 In this last investigation she further testified that she <i>heard<\/i> her mother attacking her father, while in the court below she stated she saw her mother attacking her father through the cracks in the floor, which were very large.\u00a0 On this latter occasion, under a lengthy cross-examination (as shown by the analysis of her testimony above) this witness was unable to maintain even a semblance of a plausible story.\u00a0 It further appears from the testimony of the assistant fiscal that the cracks in the floor of the house, instead of being from one and one-third to two inches wide as stated by Apolonia, or \"very wide\" as stated by Maria, were only about one-eighth of an inch wide, which would have rendered it difficult if not impossible to see from underneath the house what was going on upstairs, even though a light were in the room as stated by one of these witnesses.\u00a0 From this slight resume of the testimony of these two girls, which does not by any means enumerate all the discrepancies in their declarations, it is apparent that there is no foundation in fact for their claim that they were coerced into accusing Bonifacio of the crime, or that they were telling the truth when they implicated Adriana de los Santos, from the fact that they directly contradict the latter in the very investigation in which they claim they testified under duress, and from the further fact that their declarations at other times when they claimed to.be telling the truth were not consistent with each other.\u00a0 If anything more be wanting, we have the statement of the justice of the peace and of the assistant fiscal to the effect that during the time they were conducting their investigations they observed nothing suspicious in the actions of Marquez.\u00a0 And furthermore, the trial court evidently did not believe the statement of these witnesses with regard to Marquez, since he sentenced each and every one of the witnesses who changed their statements to varying terms of imprisonment for perjury. For these reasons we reject as utterly absurd the allegation that these witnesses were induced to testify falsely by Jacinto Marquez.\u00a0 nd as that is the sole explanation offered by them of their testimony wherein they accused Bonifacio, the inevitable conclusion is that all of these witnesses have committed perjury beyond the possibility of argument, either in their testimony which supports the hypothesis that Adriana de los Santos committed the crime, or when they testified, that Bonifacio was the guilty person.\u00a0 And in conformity with the rule that testimony of a perjured witness should not be accepted unless corroborated\u00a0 by other independent and reliable evidence, we must look to the other evidence of record to support a judgment of conviction.<br\/><br\/>As for Eradio Macoto Cruz, a perusal of his testimony before the justice of the peace shows that he was attempting to fabricate a plausible story favorable to Bonifacio.<br\/><br\/>There remains to be considered the testimony of Julian Garcia, the justice of the peace.\u00a0 The lower court accepted the testimony of this witness and practically bases his judgment of conviction upon the confession made to him by Adriana de los Santos the morning after the crime.\u00a0 We also are disposed to place entire confidence in the integrity of this witness.\u00a0 But the court erred in appraising the confession made to him on the morning after the murder.<br\/><br\/>If a confession be free and voluntary\u2014the deliberate act of the accused with a full comprehension of its significance, there is no impediment to its admission as evidence, and it then becomes evidence of a high order; since it is supported by the presumption\u2014a very strong one\u2014that no person of normal mind will deliberately and knowingly confess himself to be the perpetrator of a crime, especially if it be a serious crime, unless prompted by truth and conscience.<br\/><br\/>Is there any evidence in the record before us tending to show that the confession of the accused was not voluntary?\u00a0 The testimony of the accused in subsequent proceedings certainly answers this question in the affirmative; but the trial court appraised this testimony as worthless, assigning as his reason for so doing <i>that it was inconsistent with the said confession<\/i>. This, we think, was clearly erroneous.\u00a0 To disregard her explanation of the circumstances under which the confession was made because it repudiates the confession is to deny her the right of attempting to show that it was involuntary.\u00a0 Statements made during an involuntary confession are not on the same plane with statements made willfully and perversely, which, latter constitute perjury when made before a court under oath.\u00a0 They are, it is true, knowingly false, but not willfully so.\u00a0 An opportunity should riot be denied the accused to disown a confession, to show that he was the mere mouthpiece of another person, or was actuated by an uncontrollable and overpowering emotion in speaking falsely. And such exculpatory statements are not to be considered as impeaching the accused, whereby the maxim, <i>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus<\/i>, should be applied to his testimony. Such statements should primarily be considered as negativing any presumption or any evidence tending to show that the confession was voluntary. If the declaration of the accused, together with any other evidence he may produce, that his confession was given involuntarily is not considered sufficient to establish the fact that it was so rendered, he stands convicted without resort to the maxim, provided, of course, the confession is corroborated by independent proof of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">corpus delicti.<\/span>\u00a0 But if the accused shows, that the confession was involuntary, as that term is used with reference to confessions, the confession cannot be considered as evidence of the guilt of the accused. His conviction must depend upon other evidence.\u00a0 Involuntary confessions are rejected by all courts\u2014by some on the ground that a confession so obtained is unreliable; and by some on the grounds of humanitarian principles which abhor all forms of torture or unfairness toward the accused in criminal proceedings. But either theory arrives at the same goal.\u00a0 Such a confession is not legal evidence and must be rejected.\u00a0 If the accused satisfactorily shows that it was made involuntarily, the confession stands discredited in the eyes of the law and is as a thing which never existed.\u00a0 It was therefore error to reject the testimony of the accused in the present case because it was in conflict with her confession.\u00a0 The admissibility of that confession should have been first decided.\u00a0 If admissible as evidence, it is unnecessary to further consider the evidence of record, as it is virtually equivalent to a plea of guilty in open court.\u00a0 But if not admissible as evidence, the prosecution must rely on other evidence to sustain a conviction.<br\/><br\/>Owing to the fact that we have set aside as unreliable the testimony of practically all of the witnesses for the prosecution, the testimony of the accused in this case stands practically uncontradicted.\u00a0 This is due to the fact that no other witnesses than those already discredited were able to testify directly to any of the occurrences of that night, and to the further fact that there is so little circumstantial evidence available.<br\/><br\/>It is true that the bolo with which the deceased was killed was produced in evidence, and that it was shown to belong to the deceased. The defendant admitted that it was in the house on the night of the murder and that it was the instrument with which the wounds were inflicted on her husband. While this is evidence which would aid in convicting the accused, we cannot conclude that because the deceased was killed with his own bolo in his own house that his wife is guilty of the crime.\u00a0 To do this we would have to assert that beyond a reasonable doubt no other person could have availed himself of the bolo for the purpose of committing the crime.\u00a0 Were it shown that only the accused knew the location of this bolo or that no one else could have procured it for the purpose of killing the deceased, the principal fact would indeed be strongly indicative of the guilt of the accused.\u00a0 But obviously, these additional facts with regard to the bolo cannot be presumed.<br\/><br\/>There is one other piece of circumstantial evidence\u2014the blood-stained trousers of Bonifacio.\u00a0 Bonifacio admitted that the blood on his trousers came from the body of the deceased.\u00a0 He explained this by saying that his trousers were stained while he was assisting in carrying the body to the house, stating that the blood was still dripping from the wounds on the head, which was the part of the body he carried.\u00a0 The justice of the peace testified that he arrived at the scene of the crime at 8 o'clock and did not leave until about 9 o'clock, when he ordered the body taken into the house and then left, before the order was carried out. He further stated that the body appeared to be rigid and that the blood appeared to be coagulated.\u00a0 According to the testimony of the accused the crime was committed about 12 o'clock at night and the deceased died some two hours later. It may be safely concluded that the body was lying exposed to the air for several hours after death. <br\/><blockquote>\"Blood coagulates more slowly in the dead body than in a vessel into which it has been drawn.<sup style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">[1]<\/sup> The blood may remain fluid in a dead body from four to eight, and according to Donne, as long as twelve hours after death.\u00a0 (Cours de Microscopie, 52.)\u00a0 It rarely begins to coagulate until after the lapse of four hours; <i>but if drawn from a blood vessel and exposed to the air, it would coagulate in a few minutes after its removal\"<\/i> (1 Smith's Taylor on Medical Jurisprudence, 439.)<\/blockquote>The statement, therefore', that the blood was dripping from the wounds on the head at the time it was carried into the house does not ring true.\u00a0 In addition, we must take into consideration the unsatisfactory testimony of Bonifacio himself on other matters, and the palpable attempt of Eradio Macoto Cruz to account for Bonifacio's where abouts on the night of the murder.\u00a0 Had the testimony of Bonifacio and his friend Cruz been more consistent, we might overlook the improbability of the former's statement that the blood was dripping from the head of the deceased so long after death occurred, and accept his explanation of those stains.\u00a0 But under the circumstances, we seriously doubt the truth of his statement that his trousers were stained at the time and in the manner he claims they were.\u00a0 Could Bonifacio's explanation of these blood-stained trousers be accepted as true1, their triviality as evidence in this case would be apparent.\u00a0 But that explanation is not satisfying, and Bonifacio accounts for these stains in no other way.\u00a0 On the other hand, in the story of the defendant, an explanation is offered both reasonable and probable.\u00a0 If, as stated by the accused, Banifacio wielded the bolo which caused the death of her husband, there is nothing inherently improbable, indeed it is inherently probable, that these stains on his clothing were made at that time.\u00a0 Blood-stains on the clothing of a suspected murderer have often been important links in the chain of evidence securing his conviction.\u00a0 (Wharton on Homicide, \u00a7 611.) Inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence should be fair and natural and not forced and artificial.\u00a0 (Com. <i>vs<\/i>. Webster, 5 Cush.\u00a0 (59 Mass.), 295.)\u00a0 Of the two theories set forth as to how the stains in question occurred, it seems patent that the latter is far more in conformity with the rule than the former.\u00a0 We are, of course, not considering the guilt of Bonifacio, except in a negative way.\u00a0 We would not be heard to say that these stained trousers are sufficient to convict him of the crime.\u00a0 But they certainly do serve to embark the question of the guilt of the defendant upon a sea of uncertainty and suspicion. Again, when it is considered that the discredited witnesses for the prosecution, in deliberately trying to serve the court with an account of the murder which would place the responsibility for the crime on Adriana de los Santos and completely exonerate Bonifacio, signally failed to render a consistent and passable story of the crime, and that these witnesses undoubtedly knew the real facts of the case, the question arises, Why did they fail to such an extent unless it be that to accomplish their purpose it was necessary to depart far afield from the truth, and that their inventive capacity was unable to cope with the difficulties they encountered in their undertaking?<br\/><br\/>From the foregoing observations, therefore, it is concluded: (1) That the witnesses for the prosecution have committed perjury, either in accusing Bonifacio of the crime, or in accusing Adriana de los Santos of it; (2) that Bonifacio and his friend Eradio Macoto Cruz were unable satisfactorily to account for the former's whereabouts on the night of the crime; (3) that Bonifacio's explanation of the blood-stains on his clothing is highly improbable; and (4) that the testimony of the perjured witnesses accusing Adriana de los Santos of the crime is sufficiently inconsistent and self-contradictory, taken altogether, to inspire grave suspicion as to its being the true version of the affair.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>The testimony of the defendant in a criminal case is, generally speaking, subject to much the same rules and principles as that of any other witness.\u00a0 (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Bolar, 1 Phil. Rep., 243.) He presumed to be innocent until his guilt is proven, and in determining his guilt, the whole evidence of record must be considered.\u00a0 His testimony, it is true, is to be considered subject to the qualification that he is interested in the outcome of the trial, and is testifying in his own behalf, in determining his credibility; but that alone is no reason for disregarding it. (Underhill on Crim. Ev., \u00a7 58.)\u00a0 There is nothing inherently improbable in the defendant's account of the crime.\u00a0 The murder of a husband by the paramour of his wife is a common, sordid tale, too frequently met with in the annals of criminal law.\u00a0 Homicide having as its cause conjugal infidelity is considered of sufficient importance and frequency by the textwriters to deserve special notice (1 Greenl. Ev., \u00a7 14 (o); Wharton on Homicide, \u00a7 598; 21 Cyc, 913), and the cases will be found digested in 10 Dec. Dig., \"Homicide,\" \u00a7\u00a7 166 (7) and 166 (8), and 26 Am. Dig,, \u00a7\u00a7 326 and 327.\u00a0 The defendant's account of this criminal intimacy in the court below, under a searching examination, is consistent in every way.\u00a0 It no time did Bonifacio or his relatives meet this charge of adulterous relations with the defendant with anything like adequate and convincing statements.\u00a0 Mere perfunctory denials on the part of the daughters of the deceased and Bonifacio that he had been at their home for a week or two prior to the murder is the only reffltation of the defendant's story in this respect.\u00a0 In the investigation held two days after the crime had been committed, we see them all apparently accepting the testimony of the defendant in this respect as true.<br\/><br\/>If it be said that she assigned as the reason for her selfinculpatory statements to the justice of the peace, first, that she wished to avoid the necessity of disclosing her illicit relations with Bonifacio, and, second, that Bonifacio had threatened her with death if she did not assume responsibility for the crime and also that she did not wish to expose Bonifacio as Eligio Ignacio was there making inquiries and she was afraid of further violence, it may be answered that all three of these reasons might have influenced her to make the confession.\u00a0 They are not necessarily inconsistent with each other.\u00a0 And that the reasons she assigned in the Court of First Instance for making this confession would be sufficient to compel her to accept responsibility for the crime a few hours after its commission, when surrounded only by the relatives of Bonifacio, can scarcely be doubted.\u00a0 Upon the question of whether a confession is voluntary, the age, character, and situation of the accused at the time it was made is an important consideration.\u00a0 Much depends upon the situation and surroundings of the accused. This is the position taken by the courts, whatever the theory of exclusion of incriminating statements may be.\u00a0 (Beckman <i>vs<\/i>. State, 100 Ala., 15; 14 So., 859; Com. <i>vs<\/i>.\u00a0 Sheets, 197 Pa., 69; 46 Atl., 753; United States <i>vs<\/i>. Cooper, Fed. Cas., No. 14864.)\u00a0 Much depends upon the intelligence of the accused or want of it.\u00a0 The defendant must realize the import of his act. (Cady <i>vs<\/i>. State, 44 Miss., 332.) In Biscoe <i>vs<\/i>. State (67 Md., 6; 8 Atl., 571), the court said (P. 7):<br\/><blockquote>\"It is not, of course, an easy matter to measure in all cases the force of the influence used or to decide as to its precise effect upon the mind of the prisoner; much, very much we may add, depends upon the age, the experience, the intelligence and character of the prisoner.\"<\/blockquote>In the case at bar the defendant was a very ignorant woman.\u00a0 She had been surrounded by the relatives of the deceased for some hours before the arrival of the justice.\u00a0 This environment was, to \"say the least, propitious for inducing the accused by threats to assume the responsibility.\u00a0 The Attorney-General suggests that even if not the actual murderer of Ignacio, the defendant at least aided and abetted Bonifacio in committing it.\u00a0 There is no evidence whatever in the record before us of collusion between these two persons in the commission of the crime.\u00a0 As stated above, two theories have been developed: one that Bonifacio killed the deceased, and one that this defendant killed him.<br\/><br\/>There is no foundation upon which to base a finding that this defendant was an accessory to the crime.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, after a thorough review of the case, we do not have that \"abiding conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of the charge *\u00a0 *\u00a0 * a certainty that convinces and directs the understanding and satisfies the reason and judgment of those who are bound to act conscientiously upon it.\"<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the trial court is therefore reversed, and the defendant ordered set at liberty forthwith.

CIRIACO LIMBO, APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The appellant Ciriaco Limbo, together with four others, was charged with the theft of two horses in the Court of First Instance of Laguna Province.\u00a0 All of the defendants were convicted.\u00a0 None of the defendants, except Limbo, appealed from the judgment convicting and sentencing them in the court below.\u00a0\u00a0 Limbo was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and to pay a fine of 2,000 <i>pesetas<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The record discloses that the appellant Ciriaco Limbo was an employee of the Bureau of Printing; that he stole several blank certificates used for the registration of large cattle from the bookbinding department of that Bureau and sold them to one of his codefendants Pedro Flores, for the sum of P15 each; and that these registration certificates were used by Flores and the other codefendants in effecting a sale of the two horses for the theft of which they were convicted.<br\/><br\/>There is nothing whatever in the record other than the facts just set forth to show that the appellant took any part, direct or indirect, either in the stealing of the horses or in selling them after they had been stolen.\u00a0 The certificates appear to have been stolen by him and sold to FLores in the city of Manila some time before the commission of the theft, and it does not appear that he had any knowledge whatever as to the commission of the crime of theft by his codefendants, or that he entered into any conspiracy\u00a0 or arrangement with them looking to the commission of the crime,\u00a0 or that he recevied any share of the proceeds of the sale of the horses.\u00a0 He has already been prosecuted and convicted in the Court of First Instance for the theft of the certificates, and sentenced to serve six months in Bilibid and to pay a fine of P100, together with the accessory penalties prescribed by law.\u00a0 The trial judge found him guilty as a <i>complice<\/i> (accessory before the fact), but we are of opinion that the evidence of record does not sustain a finding of his guilt of the crime with which he is charged in this information either as principal, <i>complice<\/i> (accessory before the fact) or accessory after the fact.<br\/><br\/>There can be little doubt that when the appellant sold the stolen certificates to his codefendant for the sum of P15 each he must have suspected that the purchaser intended to make use of them for some unlawful purpose; but it would be going far to hold him guilty as principal or accessory of any and every offense in the commission of which the purchaser of the certificates may have made use of them, in the absence of proof either of knowledge on the part of the vendor of the crime which the purchaser intended to commit with the aid of the stolen certificates: or of a community of purpose between the vendor and the purchaser to commit such crime or some other crime of which it was the natural and probable consequence.\u00a0 Viada (Vol. I, p. 370), discussing the provisions of article 15 of the Penal Code which declares who shall be deemed to be <i>complices<\/i>, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"In\u00a0 accordance with this definition, and completing it in the portion referring to the principals, we will say that a complice in a crime is <i>he who cooperates in its execution by previous or simultaneous acts<\/i>, provided that he has not taken direct part in such execution, or forced or induced others to execute it, or cooperated in its perpetration by an indispensable act, for should any of these circumstances exist, he would not be a <i>complice<\/i> but a <i>principal<\/i>.\u00a0 Thus, he who lends a murderer the dagger or pistol for executing the crime is a complice in the crime, because he cooperates in its execution by a previous act, which, however, cannot be characterized as <i>indispensable<\/i>, for it is easily conceivable that, had\u00a0 he not lent the weapon, the murderer might have been able to secure it in some other way.\u00a0 Likewise, and for the same reason, he is a <i>complice<\/i> in the crime of robbery who secures for another the false or skeleton key that facilitates entrance into the dwelling it is proposed to rob; in the crime of rape the pharmacist who, knowing the criminal purpose of another, furnishes him the drug with which he will put his victim to sleep in order to rape her is equally a <i>complice<\/i> in the crime, for he has cooperated in its execution by a previous\u00a0 act, although not an indispensable one, as some one else might have furnished the drug; he who, while robbers are assaulting a house, entertains its owner so that he may not return thereto until after the robbery is consummated, is also a <i>complice<\/i> in the crime, for he has cooperated therein with a simultaneous act, although not an indispensable one for its accomplishment.\"<\/blockquote>It may not always be easy to distinguish the cases wherein one whose act has made possible the commission of a crime is or is not to be held guilty as a <i>complice<\/i>, but speaking generally, it seems clear that guilt of a crime as <i>complice<\/i> cannot be predicated on the commission of a particular act, unless the act was done in the furtherance of the commission of the crime by one who knew that others intended to commit it or some other crime of which it was the natural or probable consequence.\u00a0 In other words,\u00a0 there must be a community of unlawful purpose at the time the act was committed.\u00a0 The\u00a0 common purpose need not be to commit the particular crime which was in fact committed, but the crime actually committed must have been committed in pursuance of the common purpose to commit some offense, or as a natural or probable consequence thereof.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar there does not appear to have been any community of purpose between Limbo and his codefendants to commit the theft of which they were convicted, nor was the theft committed in pursuance of any arrangement between them to commit some other offense of which it was the natural or probable consequence.\u00a0 We are of opinion therefore that the evidence of record does not sustain his conviction as a <i>complice<\/i> (accessory before the fact).<br\/><br\/>It may be convenient, in connection with this discussion as to the nature of the act which will render one guilty of the commission of a crime as <i>complice<\/i>, to indicate that the English word \"accomplice\" and the Spanish term \"complice,\" although often treated as equivalents in translation, are not in fact identical, although derived from the same Latin root.\u00a0 The English word \"accomplice\" is defined by Bouvier to be \"One who is concerned in the commission of a crime,\" and it is said that the term in its fullness includes in its meaning all 'persons who have been concerned in the commission of a crime, all <i>participes criminis<\/i>, whether they are considered in strict legal propriety as principals in the first or second degree, or merely as accessories before or after the fact (Fost. Cr. Cas., 341; 1 Russ. Cr., 21; 4 Bla. Com., 331; 1 Phil. Ev., 28) whereas the word <i>complice<\/i> as defined in the Spanish Penal Code (art. 14) is applicable only to one who, not being included in article 13 (i. e., a principal) cooperates in the execution of the act by previous or simultaneous acts.\u00a0 Under this definition a more accurate legal equivalent of the Spanish word <i>complice<\/i> in English would appear to be the technical term \"accessory before the fact;\" and in general, the English word \"accomplice\" should be rendered into Spanish by the use of some such phrase as \"participante en el delito\" (particeps criminis).<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the court below, in so far as it convicts and sentences this appellant, should be reversed and the information dismissed as to him, with his proportionate share of the costs in both instances de oficio.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Suarez, of Sorsogon, in payment of a debt which they owed him, and that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, there was no encumbrance on the properties mentioned, nor was there any person who had any right or share therein, with the exception of the obligation that affected the same, as specified in the instrument of November 14, 1907, which is Exhibit No. 20.\u00a0 On pages 14 to 18 of the record is found an amendment of some details not contained in the aforesaid application.\u00a0 On the hearing of the case oral testimony was introduced by the applicant.<br\/><br\/>At this stage of the proceedings counsel for the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation,\u00a0 by written motion of April 30, 1910, requested that the applicant, Angel Ortiz, be substituted by the counsel for the said banking concern as the applicant in this case, and that, in due course of time, a decree be issued in favor of the aforesaid corporation, for the registration of each and all of the real properties mentioned and described in this case.\u00a0 This motion further recited that Ortiz, by an instrument of April 21, 1908, ratified before a notary, transferred to the Hongkong Bank with other property, that herein concerned, in payment of the sum which he was owing; that the right was reserved to Angel Ortiz to repurchase the property in question within the period of one year counting from the 21st of April, 1908, which period was, by another instrument of April\u00a0 21, 1909, also ratified before a notary, extended to one year more, that is, to April 21, 1910; that the period stipulated for the repurchase of the said real properties, as well as the extension of time allowed, had both expired, without the transferrer Ortiz having availed himself of the right that had been reserved to him, and that, therefore, the ownership of each and all of the real properties specified and described in this case had become consolidated in favor of the said bank and that the transfer, made to the latter on April 21, 1908, was now final, absolute, and irrevocable.<br\/><br\/>At the hearing had on this motion, the attorney, Alfredo Chicote, in Ortiz' name, opposed the petition of the bank, on the ground that the instrument presented at the trial was not one of sale with right of repurchase, nor was it all the contract between The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Angel Ortiz, and alleged that, on the\u00a0 first page of the said instrument, allusion is made to another covenant executed on the same date, April 21, 1908, in which the period for the exercise of the right of redemption is fixed at five years with the additional stipulation that Ortiz should pay during\" these five years P20,000 out of the proceeds of his business for the purpose of gradually paying up the purchase price, which covenant is an integral part of the instrument of the same date, exhibited at trial, and if Ortiz through fault, negligence or malice should fail to pay the said P20,000, then the period of five years, by failure to fulfill the obligation agreed upon, should be considered to have elapsed; that it was also stipulated that, in any case where the bank might be entitled to consider the period for repurchase as having expired, it should deliver to Ortiz the sum required for the redemption of his properties, under security of a mortgage on the same which the bank could foreclose in the manner provided by the Code of Civil Procedure; that, as the debtor Ortiz was unable to pay to the bank the said P20,000, not through any fault, negligence or malice on his part, but because his business produced no profits, the period was extended to one year more, by an instrument of April 21, 1909; and that, by virtue of the contract executed on or about July 6, 1909, by and between The Hongkong Bank, Angel Ortiz and Messrs. Lizarraga, the bank consented that Messrs. Lizarraga should, instead of Ortiz, directly deliver to it the said P20,000, and that Ortiz' business should\u00a0 be turned over to Messrs. Lizarraga, wherefore even though Ortiz had wished to pay the P20,000, he could not have done so, since the business was no longer in his charge.<br\/><br\/>During the hearing of the case counsel for the bank and for Angel Ortiz introduced oral and documentary evidence upon which the aforementioned decree was rendered.<br\/><br\/>On the supposition that Angel Ortiz, as owner of the twenty-one properties specified in his application, was entitled to ask for the registration of his ownership in the property registry in accordance with the law, the principal issue involved in this case\u00a0 is the question as to whether The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (which acquired and consolidated the ownership of the said twenty-one properties, on account of the period fixed in the contract of purchase and sale having lapsed without the vendor Ortiz having repurchased these properties, notwithstanding the lapse of the period of one year and of the renewal thereof for another year, allowed for their redemption) was entitled to obtain\u00a0 from the Court of Land Registration authorization to subrogate itself in the place and stead of the vendor, who had already ceased to be the owner of the properties sought to be registered.<br\/><br\/>Section 29\u00a0 of Act\u00a0 No. 496 provides as follows; \"After the filing of\u00a0 the application and before registration the land therein described may be dealt with and instruments relating thereto shall be recorded, in the same manner as if no application had been made; but all instruments left for record relating to such land shall be indexed in the usual manner, etc.\"<br\/><br\/>Angel Ortiz, the lawful owner of the said twenty-one properties, including rural and urban, owed the bank a considerable sum and, as security for its payment, had to mortgage these properties, which he did by an instrument of November 14, 1907, entered in the property registry.\u00a0 On December 12 of the same year, 1907, before the removal of this encumbrance, he applied to the Land Court for the registration of his twenty-one mortgaged properties.<br\/><br\/>Ortiz having been unable to comply with his engagement to pay his debt to the bank, and in order to avoid a foreclosure sale of the mortgaged properties, got the Hongkong Bank to accept an arrangement consisting in the sale of these properties to the creditor bank for a sum equal to his\u00a0 debt, under the stipulation that he should be allowed to repurchase them within one year counting from the 21st of April, 1908.\u00a0 The vendor was to continue in the use and occupation of the properties sold, without the payment of any interest\u00a0 or rent, and his only obligation was to deposit with the bank the net proceeds obtained from his business.\u00a0 If the amount deposited by the end of the said period reached P20,000, the bank was to grant Ortiz the necessary sum, under mortgage security, so that together with the said P20,000 he might be able to redeem the properties sold.<br\/><br\/>The year elapsed and the vendor Ortiz was unable to deliver in deposit the P20,000 agreed upon, and at his request the purchaser bank allowed him another year's extension of time, under the same conditions.\u00a0 This renewal likewise lapsed and still Ortiz did not comply with his engagement.\u00a0 The bank therefore consolidated its ownership and by operation of law became the absolute owner of the properties sold in payment of a debt of P270,000.\u00a0 The record discloses absolutely no proof that the period for the\u00a0 repurchase was five years; on the contrary, the notarial documents executed by Ortiz in favor of the bank, on April 21, 1908, and April 21, 1909, clearly prove that in the first instrument a year was fixed and in the second an extension of time of another year was granted him to enable him to\u00a0 repurchase the properties sold, and as he, the vendor, did not do so, the bank became the owner of the same.\u00a0 The sale that during the years from 1908 to 1910 was merely one under right of repurchase thus became absolute\u00a0 from the 21st of April, 1910.<br\/><br\/>The judge of the Court of Land Registration was of the opinion that the ownership and control of the real properties which were the subject matter of the application presented by the vendor Angel Ortiz for the purpose of the registration of the said properties in the property registry, had passed to the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, and that the original applicant, by reason of his having surrendered and transferred his properties without having repurchased them within the stipulated period, was no longer entitled to register them in his name.\u00a0 The court therefore held that the Hongkong Bank, the purchaser, had an indisputable right to substitute the applicant Angel Ortiz in this case and to obtain the registration of the properties that it had acquired, for the reason that the said bank had been subrogated in the rights of the applicant Ortiz, who, on account of his failure to make use of his\u00a0 right to repurchase the properties that he had sold, ceased thenceforth to be the owner of the same, nor could he\u00a0 be considered as such by the courts in view of the contents of the two notarial instruments which prove, without contradiction whatever, that he had sold the real properties he sought to register and because the period allowed for their repurchase had fully expired.\u00a0 Therefore the ownership of the bank, the purchaser, was in fact consolidated, and in its name the registration must of course be made, in accordance with the law governing\" this matter, as the subrogated owner in the place and stead of the applicant, the vendor.<br\/><br\/>Article 1509 of the Civil Code prescribes:\u00a0 \"If the vendor should not comply with the provisions of article 1518, the vendee shall irrevocably acquire the ownership of the thing sold.\"<br\/><br\/>Article 1518, aforecited, provides; \"The vendor cannot exercise the right of redemption without returning to the vendee the price of the sale, etc.\"<br\/><br\/>It was proved that Angel Ortiz sold his properties to the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank under reservation of his right to recover them within the period of one year which was extended for another year,\u00a0 pursuant to the provisions of articles 1507 and 1508 of the Civil Code, but he did not reimburse the purchaser for the price of the sale, which was his original debt to the purchaser bank itself.\u00a0 Therefore the latter, in accordance with the law, irrevocably acquired the ownership of the\u00a0 properties sold by its original debtor Angel Ortiz and, upon this premise, the bank was perfectly entitled to be subrogated in this case, as it was, in place of the applicant Angel Ortiz; therefore it is unquestionable that the properties, which the bank lawfully acquired by deed of conveyance, must be registered in its name as the lawful owner thereof.<br\/><br\/>The allegation made by counsel for Ortiz, that the period fixed for the repurchase was five years, cannot be admitted for want of proof.\u00a0 This period of time is set forth in the fourth paragraph of the instrument of April 21, 1908 (Exhibit 201), page 713 of the record, where the transferer or vendor of the properties in payment of his debt states that, in order to avoid a foreclosure sale of the mortgaged properties which he transferred to the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, he might, if he should be permitted so to do, pay instead his debt within said period of five years instead of sacrificing his properties and with the profits obtained therefrom materially diminish his debt by paying the sum of P20,000 the first year; and, accordingly, in the same instrument, he declares that he has assigned and transferred to the creditor bank, through an instrument of the same date, the properties therein specified.\u00a0 In the instrument referred to, executed on the same date, April 21, 1908, page 116 of the record, the condition was stipulated among others that if, within the period of one year counting from date, Ortiz should pay to the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank the sum of P270,460.03, then the latter\u00a0 should be obliged to resell to him the properties therein specified, but that, if he did not do so, the conveyance should be final and irrevocable.\u00a0 As Ortiz did not succeed, in accordance with the agreement, in repurchasing the properties sold, another instrument was executed on April 21 of the following year, 1909, page 721 of the record, in which the vendor Ortiz stated that he desired that the bank should grant him, notwithstanding his involuntary noncompliance with what had been stipulated and covenanted, a further delay and an extension of the period for the repurchase of the properties he had sold, and for this purpose he ratified, by means of an instrument entitled \"Assignment of property in payment of a debt,\" the previous agreement executed on\u00a0 April 21, 1908.\u00a0 The purchaser Ortiz was in fact granted such extension of one year, to April 21, 1910, but neither during this period did he avail himself of his redemption right.\u00a0 Therefore, in accordance with the stipulations agreed upon, the sale and transfer of property made by Ortiz in payment of his debts to the bank became final and\u00a0 absolute by the lapse of the\u00a0 stipulated time and of its extension.\u00a0 The covenant made by and between Ortiz\u00a0 and the bank and the latter's rights as the purchaser, now the owner, of the properties sold, cannot be affected by the special contract executed in July, 1909, between Ortiz and Lizarraga Hermanos, with the bank's knowledge, to the end that this firm should, during the period allowed for the redemption, have charge of the administration of the properties sold, in the hope that under its management they might produce what Ortiz had been unsuccessful in obtaining from them during the time they had been in his hands.\u00a0 The Hongkong Bank, the\u00a0 purchaser, found itself necessarily obliged to accept and acquire the vendor's properties in payment of his debt, lest it might not collect what he was owing it, and it had to consent to Lizarraga Hermanos' administering them to see whether this firm might derive the profit from them that their previous owner had been unable to obtain, for what the bank sought was the collection of its credit and its aim was not to get the properties which were sold to it in payment of the same.<br\/><br\/>Besides the adverse claim filed by the Attorney-General with respect to the first parcel of land bordering on the shore, the record discloses no other against the application for the registration of the properties in\u00a0 question.\u00a0 This application is sufficient and proper, upon the fulfillment of the conditions and requirements prescribed by law.\u00a0 Therefore the decree appealed from is in accordance with the law and the merits of the case.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the error assigned to the decree appealed from is deemed to have been refuted, the said decree should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs upon the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Paragraph one of section thirteen of Act Numbered One hundred and ninety, entitled 'An Act providing a Code of Procedure in Civil Actions and Special Proceedings in the Philippine Islands' is hereby amended to read as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"1. Those who have been duly licensed under the laws and orders of the Islands under the sovereignty of Spain or of the United States and are in good and regular standing as members of the bar of the Philippine Islands at the time of the adoption of this code: <i>Provided<\/i>, That any person who, prior to the passage of this Act, or at any time thereafter; shall have held, under the authority of the United States, the position of justice of the Supreme Court, judge of the Court of First Instance, or judge or associate judge of the Court of Land Registration, of the Philippine Islands, or the position of Attorney General, Solicitor-General, Assistant Attorney-General, assistant attorney in the office of the Attorney-General, prosecuting attorney for the city of Manila, assistant prosecuting attorney for the city of Manila, city attorney of Manila, assistant city attorney of Manila, provincial fiscal, attorney for the Moro Province, or assistant attorney for the Moro Province, may be licensed to practice law in\u00a0 the courts of the Philippine Islands without an examination, upon motion before the Supreme Court and establishing such fact to the satisfaction of said court' \"<br\/><\/blockquote>The records of this court disclose that on a former occasion this \napplicant took, and failed to pass the prescribed examination.\u00a0 The \nreport of the examining board, dated March 23, 1907, shows that he \nreceived an average of only 71 per cent in the various branches of legal\n learning upon which he was examined, thus falling four points short of \nthe\u00a0 required percentage of 75.\u00a0 We would be delinquent in the \nperformance of our duty to the public and to the bar, if, in the face of\n this affirmative indication of the deficiency of the applicant in the \nrequired qualifications of learning in the law at the time when he \npresented his former application for admission to the bar, we should \ngrant him a license to practice law in the courts of these \nIslands,without first satisfying ourselves that despite his failure to \npass the examination on that occasion, he now \"possesses the necessary \nqualifications of learning and ability.\"<br\/><br\/>But it is contended that under the provisions of the above-cited statute the applicant is entitled as of right to be admitted to the bar without taking the prescribed examination \"upon motion before the Supreme Court\" accompanied by satisfactory proof that he has held and now holds the office of provincial fiscal of the Province of Batanes.\u00a0 It is urged that having in mind the object which the legislator apparently sought to attain in enacting the above-cited amendment to the earlier statute, and in view of the context generally and especially of the fact that the amendment was inserted as a proviso in that section of the original Act which specifically provides for the admission of certain candidates without examination, the clause \"may be licensed to practice law in the courts of the Philippine Islands without and examination\" should be construed so as to mean \"shall be licensed to practice law in the Philippine Islands without an examination.\"\u00a0 It is contended that this mandatory construction is imperatively required in order to give effect to the apparent intention of the legislator, and to the candidate's claim <i>de jure<\/i> to have the power exercised.<br\/><br\/>It must be confessed that were the inquiry limited strictly to the provisions of local law touching this matter, the contentions of the applicant would have great weight. For it is well settled that in statutory interpretation the word \"may\" should be read \"shall\" where such construction is necessary to give effect to the apparent intention of the legislator.\u00a0 In Rock Island County Supervisors <i>vs<\/i>. United States (71 U. S., 435, 446), Mr. Justice Swayne says:<br\/><blockquote>\"The conclusion to be deduced from the authorities is that where power is given to public officers, in the language of the Act before us, or in equivalent language, whenever the public interest or individual rights call for its exercise, the language used, though permissive in form, is in fact peremptory.\u00a0 What they are empowered to do for a third person the law requires shall be done.\u00a0 The power is given, not for their benefit, but for his.\u00a0 It is placed with the depositary to meet the demands of right, and to prevent a failure of justice. It is given as a remedy to those entitled to invoke its aid, and who would otherwise be remediless. In all such cases it is held that the intent of the Legislature, which is the test, was not to devolve a mere discretion, but to impose a positive and absolute duty.\"<\/blockquote>Whether the word \"may\" in a statute is to be construed as mandatory and imposing a duty, or merely as permissive and conferring discretion, is to be determined in each case from the apparent intention of the statute as gathered from the context, as well as from the language of the particular provision.\u00a0 The question in each case is whether, taken as a whole and viewed in the light of surrounding circumstances, it can be said that a purpose existed on the part of the legislator to enact a law mandatory in its character.\u00a0 If it can, then it should be given a mandatory effect; if not, then it should be given its ordinary permissive effect.\u00a0 (Colby University <i>vs<\/i>..Village of Canandaigua (U.

But any Act\u00a0 of the Commission which has the effect of setting at naught in whole or in part the Act of Congress of July 1,1902, or of any Act of Congress prescribing, defining or limiting the power conferred upon the Commission is to that extent\u00a0 invalid and void, as transcending its rightful limits and authority.<br\/><br\/>The Act of Congress was the creator of the Commission and indeed of the Government of these Islands, which is the creature of its creator.\u00a0 Its powers are defined, prescribed and limited by the Act which created it, and by such other lawful acts of its creator as may further define, prescribe, limit or expand these powers.\u00a0 It cannot lawfully transcend or infringe upon the limits thus prescribed, and any Act of the Commission repugnant to the Act of Congress which created it, or which is repugnant to any other lawful Act of its creator defining, prescribing or limiting its authority is void and invalid.\u00a0 The various Acts of Congress conferring power upon the Philippine Legislature, and defining, prescribing and limiting this power, especially the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, are to that Legislature in the nature of an organic act with its amendments, binding on it in like manner as is the Constitution of the United States upon Congress itself.<br\/><br\/>In the great case of Marbury <i>vs<\/i>. Madison (1 Cranch, 175), the Supreme Court of the United States, in a decision written by Chief Justice Marshall, laid down the doctrine in this regard which has been followed by that court unhesitatingly ever since.\u00a0 In that case the court held that an Act of Congress repugnant to the Constitution cannot become law, and that the courts of the United States are bound to take notice of the Constitution.<br\/><br\/>Applying the reasoning of that case to the question of the validity of an Act of the Philippine Commission enacted since the date of the passage of the Philippine Bill which is found to be in conflict with the provisions of the Act of Congress dealing with the same subject matter, and especially with the provisions of the Philippine Bill itself,we think there can be no doubt as to the result.\u00a0 The Act of the Commission in so far as it is in conflict with or in any wise repugnant to the various Acts of Congress dealing with the same subject matter must be held to be void and of no effect.\u00a0 Paraphrasing slightly the language used in the early case of Kemper <i>vs<\/i>. Hawkins (1 Va. Cases, 20-24), it may be said that the Acts of the Congress of the United States are to the Commission, or rather to all the departments of the Philippine Government, what a law is to individuals; nay, they constitute not only a rule of action to the various branches of the Government, but it is from them that the very\u00a0 existence of the power of the Government flows, and it is by virtue of the Acts of Congress that the powers (or portions of the right to govern) which may have been committed to this Government are prescribed.\u00a0 The Act of Congress was the Commission's commission; nay, it was its creator.<br\/><br\/>Section 9 of the Act of Congress, set out above, placed it beyond the power of the local Legislature to deprive this court of the jurisdiction or power theretofore granted to it; leaving however, to local legislative authority the right to confer additional jurisdiction, or to change the practice and method of procedure.\u00a0 The above cited provisions of Act No. 190, in force at the time when the Act of Congress was enacted, conferred upon this court the power and jurisdiction to deny admission to candidates for the bar unless, in addition to certain other prescribed conditions, they satisfy the court that they possess the necessary learning in the law,by passing an examination prescribed by general rule.\u00a0 It seems clear, therefore, that the Commission, while it was undoubtedly authorized to modify the provision requiring the holding of examinations under general rules (that being merely the prescribed mode of procedure whereby the court was required to ascertain the qualifications of the candidate) ,had no authority to deprive this court of its power to deny admission to any candidate Who fails to satisfy it that he possesses the necessary qualifications for admission to the bar of the Philippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>In construing a statute enacted by the Philippine Commission we deem it our duty not to give it a construction which would be repugnant to an Act of Congress, if the language of the statute is fairly susceptible of another construction not in conflict with the higher law.\u00a0 In doing so,we think we should not hesitate to disregard contentions touching the apparent intention of the legislator which would\u00a0 ead to the conclusion that the Commission intended to enact a law in violation of the Act of Congress.\u00a0 However specious the argument may be in favor of one of two possible constructions, it must be disregarded if on examination it is found to rest on the contention that the legislator designed an attempt to transcend the rightful limits of his authority, and that his apparent intention was to enact an invalid law.<br\/><br\/>Black on Interpretation of Laws at page 87 says:\u00a0 \"In construing a doubtful or ambiguous statute, the courts will presume that it was the intention of the legislature to enact a valid, sensible, and just law, and one which should change the prior law no further than may be necessary to effectuate the specific purpose of the act in question.\u00a0 The construction should be in harmony with this assumption whenever possible.\"<br\/><br\/>The same author, at pages 93 and 94, says:\u00a0 \"Hence it follows that the courts will not so construe the law as to make it conflict with the constitution, but will rather put such an interpretation upon it as will avoid conflict with the constitution and give it full force and effect, if this can be done without extravagance.\u00a0 If there is doubt or uncertainty as to the meaning of the legislature, if the words or provisions of the statute are obscure, or if the enactment is fairly susceptible of two or more constructions, that interpretation will be adopted which will avoid the effect of unconstitutionality, even, though it may be necessary, for this purpose, to disregard the more usual or apparent import of the language employed.\"<br\/><br\/>Without undue straining of the language used in the statute under consideration, the word \"may\" may be construed as either mandatory or permissive in its effect.\u00a0 But to construe it as mandatory would bring it in direct conflict with the Act of Congress, and we conclude therefore, despite the contentions of the applicant as to the apparent intention of the legislator, that it should be given its permissive and not its mandatory effect, and that the true intention of the legislator was to leave it within the discretion of the court to admit to the bar without examination the officials mentioned in the Act in any case wherein the court is otherwise satisfied that they possess the necessary qualifications.<br\/><br\/>Ordinarily, and in the absence of any showing to the contrary, it may fairly be assumed that an applicant who has. held one of the offices mentioned in the statute, and who, prior to his appointment, had been admitted to the practice of law in the courts of these Islands under the former sovereign or in some other jurisdiction is duly qualified for admission to the bar of these Islands. In the case In re Du Fresne (20 Phil. Rep., 488, 492), speaking of the provisions of this Act, we\u00a0 said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Appointments to the positions mentioned in Act No. 1597 are made either by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, or by the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands by and with the advice and consent of the Philippine Commission, and the legislator evidently conceived that the fact that such an appointment is made is a sufficient guaranty that after due inquiry the appointee has been found to be possessed of at least the necessary qualifications for admission to the bar.\"<\/blockquote>In the various cases wherein applications for admission to the bar under the provisions of this statute have been considered heretofore, we have accepted the fact that such appointments had been made as satisfactory evidence of the qualifications of the applicant. But in all of those cases we had reason to believe that the applicants had been practicing attorneys prior to the date of their appointment.<br\/><br\/>In the case under consideration, however, it affirmatively appears that the applicant was not and never had been a practicing attorney in this or any other\u00a0 jurisdiction prior to the date of his appointment as provincial fiscal, and it further affirmatively appears that he was deficient in the required qualifications at the time when he last applied for admission to the bar.<br\/><br\/>In the light of this affirmative proof of his deficiency on that occasion, we do\u00a0 not think that his appointment to the office' of provincial fiscal is in itself satisfactory proof of his possession of the necessary qualifications of learning and ability. We conclude therefore that this application for license to practice in the courts of the Philippines should be denied.<br\/><br\/>In view, however, of the fact that when he took the examination he fell only four points short of the necessary grade to entitle him to a license to practice; and in view also of the fact that since that time he has held the responsible office of governor of the Province of Sorsogon and presumably\u00a0 gave evidence of such marked ability in the performance of the duties of that office that the Chief Executive, with the consent and approval of the Philippine Commission, sought to retain him in the Government service by appointing him to the office of provincial fiscal, we think we would be justified under the above-cited provisions of Act\u00a0 No. 1597 in waiving in his case the ordinary examination prescribed by general rule, provided he offers satisfactory evidence of his proficiency in a special\u00a0 examination which will be given him by a committee of the court upon his application therefor, without prejudice to\u00a0 his right,if he desires so to do, to present himself at any of the ordinary examinations prescribed by general rule.

Davis, for the sum of P1,000.\u00a0 According to the terms of the contract it was agreed by both parties that the vendor should remain in actual possession of the house on and after the 18th day of February, 1909, as the tenant of the vendee, by paying P15 per month rent.\u00a0 The vendor paid the rent as agreed upon for twelve months only.\u00a0 Julian Palma sold said house on June 28, 1909, with the right to repurchase the same on or before the 24th of the following month, to Emilio Esteban, for the sum of P595.\u00a0 Under the terms of this contract Palma was to occupy the house free of rent.\u00a0 On the 23d day of September, 1909, for the consideration of P600, Palma made an absolute sale of the house to Esteban, and transferred the same on that date.\u00a0 On the 21st of December of the same year Esteban sold and transferred the house to one Jose Colomeda.\u00a0 Colomeda on the 19th day of December sold the house to the present defendant for the sum of P1,300.\u00a0 The defendant went into the actual possession of the house on this date, and has actually occupied the same up to the present time.<br\/><br\/>All of the above contracts of sales and transfers are evidenced by unregistered notarial public documents.\u00a0 The house has never been registered in the name of any person.<br\/><br\/>This action was instituted on the 19th day of October, 1910, for the purpose of recovering the possession of the house, together with rents at the rate of P15 per month.\u00a0 The defendant, in her answer, claimed to be the absolute owner of the house in question by virtue of the deed of purchase and sale executed in her favor by Jose Colomeda, and asked that judgment be entered dismissing the complaint with costs.\u00a0 The contention of the defendant was sustained by the lower court, and judgment entered accordingly.\u00a0 The\u00a0 plaintiff appealed.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the appellant insists that the trial court erred in holding that the defendant's title and right to possession could\u00a0 not be defeated by that of the plaintiff, even though the defendant were a.purchaser in good faith, without notice, and for a valuable consideration.\u00a0 On the other hand, counsel for the appellee contends (1) that the sale made by Palma to the plaintiff was one of antichresis, and consequently the plaintiff could not have acquired the ownership of the house, even though Palma failed to return the P1,000; (2) that the plaintiff's unregistered title cannot operate to defeat defendant's right of ownership and possession, because she is a \"third party;\" and (3) that plaintiff never did enter into the possession of the house in question.\u00a0 In\u00a0 support of these propositions, counsel for appellee cites articles 1881, 1882, 1883, and 1473 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>It is true that the defendant is a purchaser in good faith without knowledge of defect in her title and for a valuable consideration.\u00a0 It is also true that she entered into the actual or physical possession of the house in question on the 19th of December, 1909, and continues in such possession.\u00a0 Hers was an absolute purchase and sale, and she acquired all of the right, title, and interest\u00a0 of her vendor.<br\/><br\/>The inquiry now is, What kind of a sale was that made by Palma to the plaintiff?\u00a0 Was it a sale with the right to repurchase, or one of antichresis?\u00a0 A mere reading of the contract entered into between the plaintiff and Julian Palma is sufficient to show that the sale was one with the right to repurchase within the period of two years.\u00a0 This is specifically stated in the contract.\u00a0 The parties agreed that if Palma did not repurchase this property within two years, the plaintiff would become the absolute owner.\u00a0 The document itself says that the sale was one of <i>venta con pacto de retro<\/i>.\u00a0 It was so treated by all of the parties, and the trial court found that the sale was one of this class.\u00a0 There is not the slightest room for doubt as to the intention of the parties.\u00a0 Neither is there room for any other construction or interpretation of the contract.\u00a0 The contract speaks for itself in plain, unequivocal words.\u00a0 This contract is defined and governed by article 1507 <i>et seq<\/i>. of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>It is here recognized as a contract of <i>pacto de retro<\/i>.\u00a0 The rights and obligations of the parties to this contract are stated in those articles.\u00a0 The contract being a sale with the right to repurchase, it cannot be one of antichresis.\u00a0 The two sales are entirely different.\u00a0 In the former, the vendor cannot exercise the right of redemption without returning to the vendee the price of the sale, and if the vendor should not do this within the time agreed upon, the vendee irrevocably acquires the ownership of the thing sold; whereas, in the latter, the creditor only acquires a right to receive the fruits of the real property of his debtor with the obligation to apply them to the payment, first of the interest, and second of the principal of his credit.\u00a0 The creditor does not acquire the ownership of the real property when the sale is one of antichresis by nonpayment of the debt within the term agreed upon.<br\/><br\/>After this suit was instituted, the\u00a0 defendant filed with the register of deeds a transfer made by Palma to Esteban for annotation only.\u00a0 She did nothing more.\u00a0 It is not even contended\u00a0 that this constituted a registration of the property.\u00a0 The defendant had no registered title to the house, nor any registered interest therein; consequently, she was not a \"third party.\"<br\/><br\/>On the consummation of the sale of real\u00a0 property (and the house in question was real property) with the right to repurchase the same, the ownership then\u00a0 passes to the vendee.\u00a0 Nothing is left in the vendor except the right to repurchase.\u00a0 Whether this is a real or personal right cannot affect this case.\u00a0 The transaction between Palma and the plaintiff constituted a sale.\u00a0 The house was sold to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Article 1473 of\u00a0 the Civil Code provides:<br\/><blockquote>\"Art. 1473. If the same thing should have been sold to different vendees, the ownership shall be transferred to the person who may have first taken possession thereof in good faith, if it should be personal property.<br\/><br\/>\"Should it be real property, it shall belong to the person acquiring it who first recorded it in the registry.<br\/><br\/>\"Should there be no entry, the property shall belong to the person who first took possession of it in good faith, and, in the absence thereof, to the person who presents the oldest title, provided there is good faith.\"<\/blockquote>The house in dispute, as we have said, is real property.\u00a0 Neither party recorded his title.\u00a0 On the very day that the plaintiff bought the house he entered into possession.\u00a0 Palma then became the tenant of the plaintiff.\u00a0 The possession of the tenant, in so far as the questions in this case are concerned, is the possession of the landlord.\u00a0 After the sale between Palma and the plaintiff, the former had nothing left to sell except his right to repurchase.\u00a0 He could not legally transfer the actual possession of the house to anyone.\u00a0 Such a transfer, if made, could not prejudice the title acquired by the\u00a0 plaintiff.\u00a0 The plaintiff having purchased the property and having received from the vendee the possession of the same, his title cannot be defeated by that of the defendant.\u00a0 The defendant, being a possessor in good faith, is relieved from the payment of rents.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from is reversed and judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff as prayed for in his\u00a0 complaint, without costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

E. Ainsworth.\u00a0 A demurrer filed by the defendant was overruled on January 17, 1910, and in the same order the plaintiff was directed to attach to its complaint a copy of the contract upon which it based its action.\u00a0 The plaintiff excepted to this ruling, but nevertheless amended its complaint, on May 21, 1910, and therein set forth among other things that on November 4, 1909, the defendant leased, received and accepted\u00a0 from the plaintiff, a barge called <i>Varadero<\/i> and a large iron dredging scoop, both belonging to the latter; that the terms of the lease stipulated between the plaintiff and the defendant appeared in an instrument, which reads literally :<br\/><blockquote>\"The undersigned has assumed the engagement toward Messrs.\u00a0 'M. Novo y Co., S. en Cta.,' that he will, commencing with this date, lease\u00a0 from them the barge <i>Varadero<\/i> for P175 per month; likewise and from the same date, a dredging scoop, at the rental price of P100 per month.\u00a0 Mr. J.

E. AINSWORTH.\"<\/div><\/blockquote>That, after the defendant had used the said barge and dredging scoop five days they were totally lost at sea and were absolutely abandoned, without intention or possibility whatever of recovering them; that, up to the date of the complaint, the defendant had not returned to the plaintiff the said lost barge and dredging scoop which he had not recovered, had not paid the rental thereof, nor had he paid or would he pay their value, notwithstanding the repeated demands made upon him so to do; that, on the contrary, the defendant persisted in not returning the said barge and dredging scoop and in not paying the rental therefor, which amounted, for five days' use of the barge, to P29.16, and for the use of the dredging scoop, during an equal period, to P16.66; that the true value of the barge was P3,000 and that of the dredging scoop, P1,200; that on the same date, November 4, the defendant obtained the plaintiff's consent to have its steam launch, named <i>Amalia<\/i>, tow the said barge from the port of Cebu to the Island of Bohol, for a stipulated sum of P60, which service was rendered by the said launch; but that, up to the date of the complaint and notwithstanding the demands made, the defendant without good reason whatever had not paid the towage and still persisted in his refusal so to do, so that the sum of P60 was still unpaid and demandable; that such unwarranted refusal of the defendant had caused the plaintiff losses and damages in the sum of P500, inasmuch as, from the preceding month of November up to the date of the complaint, the plaintiff had been unable to construct or acquire another barge and dredging scoop with the price of those that had been lost; that the barge and dredging scoop referred to were absolutely indispensable for the work and business in which the plaintiff was chiefly engaged and which was disturbed and delayed by the absence of said implements; that, since the said month of November, the plaintiff had received various advantageous proposals for the lease of the said barge and\u00a0 dredging scoop and had been unable to accept such proposals, due exclusively to the fault of the defendant, wherefore the amount of the losses and damages thereby caused the plaintiff was owing and demandable, but that the defendant had failed to make payment therefor when requested so to do.\u00a0 Said counsel therefore prayed the court to render judgment in his client's behalf by sentencing the defendant to the payment of P4,805.82, the amount of all the plaintiff's claims, and the costs.<br\/><br\/>The demurrer filed against the amended complaint having been overruled, the defendant in his answer denied the allegations of subdivision (<i>a<\/i>) and all those of subdivisions (<i>c<\/i>), (<i>d<\/i>), and (<i>e<\/i>) of paragraph 1 of the complaint and admitted the allegations of subdivision (<i>b<\/i>) of the same paragraph.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the allegations of subdivision (<i>a<\/i>) of the second paragraph of the complaint, the defendant admitted that the plaintiff had made an agreement with him that the barge would be\u00a0 towed from the port of Cebu to the Island of Bohol, for the stipulated sum of P60, but the defendant denied that the plaintiff had performed such towage service and also denied all the\u00a0 other allegations contained in the said subdivision (<i>a<\/i>).\u00a0 As regards the allegations of subdivision (<i>b<\/i>) of paragraph 2 of the complaint, the defendant admitted that he had not paid the towage, but denied that he owed the plaintiff the sum of P60 therefor, or on any other account; he also denied the allegations of paragraph 3 of the complaint, as well as all the other allegations not specifically admitted in his answer.<br\/><br\/>In a countercomplaint, the defendant set forth that, on or about the 4th of November, the plaintiff company made an agreement with\u00a0 the defendant to tow the said barge, with its cargo, from the port of Cebu to the mouth of the Abatan River, in\u00a0 the Island of Bohol; that, on the said date, the plaintiff through its agents and employees took charge of the barge with its cargo for the purpose of towing the boat to the place of\u00a0 its destination, but that,\u00a0 before arriving there, the barge foundered with its entire cargo, disappeared in the sea and was totally lost, which loss was due to the carelessness and negligence of the towmen, employees, and representatives of the plaintiff firm, as well as to the carelessness and negligence of the latter party itself for having intrusted the towage to persons without experience or sufficient capacity to perform the work; that, when the barge was lost, it had on board 10 tons of coal belonging to the defendant;\u00a0 and that this coal, which was also lost, was worth P130, an amount which the plaintiff owed the defendant and had not paid him, although its payment had been demanded.\u00a0 The defendant therefore asked that judgment be rendered by absolving him from the complaint and sentencing the plaintiff party to pay P130, as an indemnity for the lost coal, and the costs of the suit.\u00a0 After trial of the case, the judgment set forth was rendered.<br\/><br\/>It devolves upon us in the present case to decide whether, in accordance with the contract and engagement contained in the document dated November 4, 1909, and subscribed by the defendant, J.\u00a0 E. Ainsworth, the plaintiff is entitled to collect from the defendant the sum of P4,8O5.82, the total amount of the value of the barge <i>Varadero<\/i> and the large iron dredging scoop, of the rentals therefor, and of that of the launch <i>Amalia<\/i> and of the losses and damages occasioned by the foundering of the barge and the dredging scoop, also whether the defendant is\u00a0 entitled to recover P130, the value of the coal belonging to him which was in the said barge and lost when it foundered.<br\/><br\/>When the defendant leased the said barge and dredging scoop at their respective rental prices, he agreed, according to the aforementioned document, to assume all liability for any loss or damage to the leased property during the existence of the contract.<br\/><br\/>It is admitted to have been proved that when the launch <i>Amalia<\/i> left the port of Cebu, on the night which must have been the 8th of November, the fifth day after the date of the contract, bound\u00a0 for the mouth of the Abatan River, Island of Bohol, good weather prevailed, the sea was tranquil and calm, there was no wind, and it was not noticed that any water had entered the hull of the barge.\u00a0 Nothing out of the ordinary happened until 4 o'clock the next morning, when the two laborers on board the barge observed that a considerable amount of water was coming into the bottom of the boat.\u00a0 They therefore requested assistance from the captain of the launch, but the barge sank before a relief boat could get alongside and the latter was unable to do more than rescue the two laborers from the water.<br\/><br\/>The record does not disclose how or why the water came into the hull of the barge while it was being towed by the launch, which also belonged to the plaintiff firm.<br\/><br\/>The barge had an approximate capacity of 27 tons and the total weight of the cargo it carried was about 19 tons.\u00a0 The trial judge, in estimating the value of the evidence adduced in this case, held that the cargo loaded on the barge was not excessive for the capacity of the boat; that the ways and means employed by the defendant in loading the barge did not tend in any manner to show cause for the accident that occurred; that the towage was effected under the exclusive direction of the captain of the launch, an employee of the\u00a0 plaintiff firm, which owned the said launch; and that there was no proof that the two laborers, placed by the defendant on board the barge, performed any acts which might have contributed to the foundering of the vessel, or failed to perform their duties.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from shows that there is a decided dearth of evidence relative to the actual cause of the sinking of the\u00a0 barge; nor is there any proof of how and in what manner the towage was effected, for the plaintiff neglected to present any testimony by the captain and crew of. the launch; but the court held that the small amount of coal placed in the hold of the\u00a0 barge, though thrown in there from above, as the plaintiff affirmed, could not have done any\u00a0 damage to the bottom of the barge, unless it be supposed that its hull was in bad condition and unsuitable for navigation, and the evidence does not show that either the plaintiff or the defendant had knowledge of any defect in the barge, or knew that it was in an unseaworthy condition.<br\/><br\/>Article 840 of the Code of Commerce prescribes as follows:\u00a0 \"The losses and damages suffered by a vessel and her cargo by reason of\u00a0 shipwreck or stranding shall be individually for the account of the owners, the part of the wreck which may be saved belonging to them in the same proportion'<br\/><br\/>Article 1902 of the Civil Code also provides:\u00a0 \"A person who by an act or omission causes damage to another when there is fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\"<br\/><br\/>This liability is contracted without agreement or consent of the person found liable, on the principle that in all cases where harm, loss, or damage has been caused to a person or to his rights by an act or omission, the aggrieved party is entitled to be indemnified, for the fault can harm only the person committing it and the results of his negligence can not affect any third person, he who acted imprudently being obligated to respond to the injured party.<br\/><br\/>An action to obtain reparation for loss occasioned by culpable or\u00a0 negligent acts or omissions necessarily requires proof of one or the other of these causes, which constitute the basis of the action, and such proof in the present case is incumbent upon the plaintiff, according to the general principles laid down in article 1214 of the Civil Code.<br\/><br\/>The record does not disclose duly substantiated evidence that the barge <i>Varadero<\/i> foundered, with its cargo and the iron dredging scoop, through the defendant's fault or negligence, as held by the trial court in the judgment appealed from,\u00a0 and so there is no legal ground for plaintiff's complaint, or for holding the defendant liable for payment of the amounts specified in the complaint.\u00a0 It is, then, indispensable for the proper application of article 1902 of the Civil Code, that the loss or damage should have been caused by the fault or negligence of a person other than the one injured or aggrieved, and that such loss or damage should not have been the result of his own acts or omissions.<br\/><br\/>In reference to the interpretation and application of that article, the supreme court of Spain, in its decision of June 16,\u00a0 1906, laid down the rule that the obligation to repair the loss caused can be enforced only when such loss is the necessary consequence of an act or omission into which fault or negligence entered.<br\/><br\/>This rule virtually affirms another set out in a previous decision, on April 6, 1896, that \"the liability sanctioned by the said article requires proof of an act or of an omission on the part of the person held liable and must have originated from such act or omission.\"<br\/><br\/>Considering the facts that the weather was good, the sea calm, and that there was no high wind during the night and up to an early hour in the morning while the said barge was on its way, and in the absence of proof that in the operation of the towage some injurious or harmful act was performed which may have caused the foundering of the craft, it may be positively affirmed, upon the evidence and pleadings in this case, that the sinking of the barge was due to an accidental and unforeseen event, in which no fault or negligence attached on the part of the defendant, and therefore the provisions of the article before mentioned are not applicable to the case at bar, nor would it be proper to sentence the defendant to make good and indemnify the losses and damages suffered by the sinking of the barge and the dredging scoop, both of which belonged to the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>According to the rule laid down by the supreme court of Spain, in its decisions of the 2d and 10th of March, 1897, the provisions of the said article 1902 of the Code do not apply in cases where the court holds that the event was accidental and fortuitous and not due to any fault or negligence on the part of a third person distinct from the one injured.<br\/><br\/>The same rule is applicable with respect to the loss of the coal by the foundering of the barge.\u00a0 The plaintiff cannot be held liable therefor.<br\/><br\/>With respect to the other features of the case, we accept the finding of the trial court to the effect that the manner in which the coal was put into the hold of the barge, to wit, by dumping it\u00a0 out of baskets carried by porters, could not have caused any material harm or damage to the hull of the barge, unless the hull was in bad condition, a fact neither proved nor admitted by either\u00a0 of the parties, and had it been so the defendant would not have leased the boat, wherefore it is to be\u00a0 resumed, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the vessel was in\u00a0 good condition when plaintiff delivered it to the defendant.\u00a0 Had the hull been damaged by the falling of the coal on the bottom of the boat during the process of loading, water would have entered immediately after the first few loads had been dumped in and while the barge was still lying in the port of Cebu, and it could not have been towed for more than six hours before a lot of water had poured into the hull, causing it to sink.<br\/><br\/>By virtue of the contract, the barge and dredging scoop were, during five days, at the defendant's disposal and it is just that he pay as rental, for the former, P29.16, and for the latter, P16.66, which amounts the plaintiff firm is entitled to collect.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby five of the six errors assigned to the judgment appealed from are deemed to have been refuted, the\u00a0 said judgment is hereby affirmed, with the exception of the third item thereof, which directs the plaintiff to pay to the defendant P130 with interest at 6 per cent per annum, which is reversed and the plaintiff is absolved from the claim for such amount; and the defendant is sentenced to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P45.82,\u00a0 the amount of the said rentals; without special finding as to costs in both instances.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C. J., Johnson, Carson<\/i>, and <i>Trent, JJ<\/i>., concur.<\/div>",

(2) for the return of the P398.75, the amount paid for the\u00a0 palay; and (3) for damages in the sum of P310.25 together with the costs of the cause.<br\/><br\/>In the first action Felipe Juan was, according to the title, the only plaintiff, but in the body of the complaint he alleged that his wife Faustina Chu-Ongco had an interest in the cause, and in effect brought the action on behalf of himself and his wife.\u00a0 Otherwise the parties and the claims were exactly the same in both actions.<br\/><br\/>The question presented here is whether the former judgment operates as an adjudication on the matter of the present action so that it cannot be retried.<br\/><br\/>The plaintiffs insist (1) that the former action was one for specific performance while the latter is one for the rescission of the contract with indemnity for damages; and (2) that the institution and termination of the first cannot be pleaded as <i>res adjudicata<\/i> of the second.\u00a0 Article 1124 of the Civil Code is cited in support of these propositions.\u00a0 This article reads:<br\/><blockquote>\"The right to rescind the obligations is considered as implied in mutual ones, in case one of the obligated persons does not comply with what is incumbent upon him.<br\/><br\/>\"The person prejudiced may choose between exacting the fulfillment of the obligation or its rescission, with indemnity for damages and payment of interest in either case.\u00a0 He may also demand the rescission, even after having requested its fulfillment, should the latter appear impossible.<br\/><br\/>\"The court shall order the rescission demanded, unless there are sufficient causes authorizing it to fix a period.<br\/><br\/>\"This is understood without prejudice to the rights of third acquirers, in accordance with articles 1295 and 1298, and with the provisions of the mortgage law.\" <\/blockquote>Under this article, the contracting party who has performed his part of the contract, and who has been prejudiced by the nonfulfillment on the part of the other contracting party may choose between exacting the fulfillment of the contract or its rescission, with indemnity for damages in either case.\u00a0 The plaintiffs' allegations in the first case before the justice of the peace were sufficient to constitute a cause of action for specific performance or for a rescission of the contract.\u00a0 They prayed for an alternative relief; that is, a delivery of the palay or its value in money with indemnity for damages in either case.\u00a0 It was upon this theory that the case was tried both in the justice of the peace court and in the Court of First Instance on appeal.\u00a0 Under our system of pleading a\u00a0 plaintiff may pray for alternative relief as was done in this case.\u00a0 The plaintiffs determined\u00a0 the character of their action\u00a0 by their prayer for either a specific performance of the contract or for a rescission with damages.\u00a0 The defendants were thus notified what the plaintiffs were seeking.\u00a0 Every phase of the case was presented in the first action and there adjudicated.\u00a0 The fact that the plaintiffs in the second action prayed for the rescission of the contract, for the return of the P398.75 and for damages did not change the character of this action from that presented in the justice of the peace court.\u00a0 Both actions\u00a0 were the same.\u00a0 The subject matter in each was identical.\u00a0 The courts which\u00a0 tried the first acted\u00a0 within their jurisdiction.\u00a0 It may be that we might, and probably would, have reversed the judgment of the Court of First Instance in the first action and rendered judgment for the plaintiffs if that action could have been brought to this court on appeal, but as that case could not reach this court we cannot now grant any relief in the second action for the reason that we must follow the general and well-established rules of law applicable to all cases and for the benefit of all.\u00a0 To adopt any other rule would upset the rules of property and the respect for the final judgments of courts.\u00a0 There must be an end to litigation and the plea of <i>res adjudicata<\/i> is one of the effective means of reaching this result.<br\/><br\/>The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed with costs against the appellants.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Reconocio entre los cuatro a los dos acusados, Teodoro Castillo y Damaso Maniquis. Teodoro Castillo dis paro tres tiros, y entonces Leon, abandonando su mujer, escapo por la ventana y no volvio sino hasta despues de que el baul que tenia en la casa habia sido abierto y sustraido su contenido y llevado. El contenido del baul consistia en dinero y alhajas. Tan pronto como se hubo escapado se dirigio al teniente del barrio y obtuvo la detencion de los acusados. Que al ser detenido Teodoro Castillo confeso ante mucha gente admitiendo que el habia cometida el delito. Damaso Maniquis no fue detenido sino hasta algun tiempo despues. Leon declaro tambien que entre los cuatro ladrones Teodoro fue el primero que entro en la casa e inmediantamente despues llego Damaso Maniquis; que reconocio claramente a los dos; que habia conocido a Teodoro Castillo antes porque habia estado varias veces en la casa para hacer compras y que no habia tenido disgustos con ninguno de ellos.<br\/><br\/>La declaracion de este testigo esta corroborada por la de su esposa Juana dizon, la cual anade que despues de que Leon habia desaparecido por la ventana dejandola a ella sola con los ladrones armados, vio que Damaso Maniquis se llevo el baul y lo hizo salir por la ventana. Declaro tambien que hizo tal cosa sin el consintimiento de ella ni el de su marido. Manifesto tambien que de los cuatro individuos, tan solo reconocio a los dos acusados. Reconocio a Damaso porque le habia visto antes frecuentemente y le identifico en la presidfencia poco despues de su detencion. Reconocio tambien a Teodoro Castillo y afirmo que habia oido su confesion. Dijo que mientras estaban en la casa la apuntaron con un revolver y la amenazaron con los bolos, pero que no la hicieron dano personal alguno.<br\/><br\/>Los otros testigos llamados por la acusacion fueron los dos policias, Julio Sagana y Eligio Gabriel, los cuales declararon que Donato les habia hablado acerca del robo mencionado a Teodoro Castillo y Damaso Maniquis como dos de los ladrones; que inmediatamente se dirigieron a la casa de Teodoro donde de sorprendieron y capturaron. Le detuvieron en la noche del robo. Cuando le encontraron, el, su esposa y un tal Joaquin estaban hablando en voz baja, mientras que otra persona estaba en acecho en los bajos: que el acusado estaba mojado y sus pantalones llenos de lodo y parecia estar cansado. estos dos policias oyeron la confesion del acusado y dijeron que la presto ante mucha gente; que no le dijeron nada el camino desde su casa a la de Donato y que el no dijo quienes eran sus companeros en el robo.<br\/><br\/>La defensa de los acusados consiste en una coartada. Presentaron varios testigos que declararon que los acusados no se encontraban en el lugar donde se cometio el robo en la noche de autos, sino que estuvieron en otros sitios mas o menos distantes de aquel.<br\/><br\/>La identidad de los acusados esta probada fuera de duda. Donato, en la misma noche del robo e inmediantamente despues de escaparse, denuncio el hecho a las autoridades, mencionando a los individuos aqui apelantes y afirmando que fueron los autores del robo. El Juez no ha titubeado en declarar a los acusados culpables del delito de robo, y nosotros estamos igualmente seguros, despues de un detennido examen de todo lo actuado, de que se ha probado su culpabilidad fuera de toda duda racional.

Manzano, and that they agreed to extend the time of payment for a reasonable period.\u00a0\u00a0 Soon after this alleged conversation and within a reasonable time the plaintiff tendered to the defendants the remaining payment with interest.\u00a0 The defendants refused to accept it upon the ground that the instrument in question constituted a sale with right to repurchase, that the payment specified in the same had not been made as therein required, and that, for that reason, the title to the premises became absolute in them.\u00a0 The plaintiff, having made his tender, thereupon began this action for the purposes above specified.<br\/><br\/>The court below found in favor of the defendants, basing his decision upon two propositions:\u00a0 First, that the instrument executed between the plaintiff and Manzano was a sale with a right to repurchase and that, second, there having been no agreement to extend the time and the payments not having been made as required by the terms of the instrument, the title to the premises became absolute in the defendants at the expiration of the time fixed.\u00a0 An appeal was taken from this judgment by the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>We find ourselves unable to agree with the learned court below upon the fundamental proposition that the document in question is a sale with the right to repurchase.\u00a0 That instrument lacks many of the essentials of such a sale.\u00a0 In a sale of this nature the rights of the parties take effect as soon as the contract itself becomes operative.\u00a0 The sale takes effect at once and title instantly passes.\u00a0 The moment title passes the right of the vendor\u00a0 to repurchase is born.\u00a0 That right is a reservation\u00a0 which, by virtue of its very nature, comes into being at the same instant as the vesting of the title in the purchaser.<br\/><br\/>In the instrument before us no title passed at the time it was executed and no reservation of a right to repurchase was made which was effective at that time.\u00a0 It contains simply an acknowledgment of a debt with an agreement to pay it and, in case of nonpayment, an agreement that the title to the lands shall pass at\u00a0 the time default in payment is made, that is, <i>in the future<\/i>.\u00a0 (Decision of the supreme court of Spain, January 18, 1900.)\u00a0\u00a0 One of the fundamental and essential requisites of a sale with a right to repurchase is the absolute control which the vendor has over the exercise of the right to\u00a0 repurchase.\u00a0 <i>When<\/i> he shall repurchase, or <i>whether he shall repurchase at all<\/i>, is left wholly to him, provided he does it within the\u00a0 time required by law.<br\/><br\/>He may repurchase at any moment he pleases or he may refuse to repurchase\u00a0 at all.\u00a0 Destroyed\u00a0 or restricted this absolute freedom of action, the contract ceases to be\u00a0 one of sale with right to repurchase.<br\/><br\/>Having found that the instrument is not a sale with right of repurchase, it is unnecessary to go into the question of fact as to whether there was an extension of the time of payment.\u00a0 The instrument not being a <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, the lands described therein may be redeemed at any time before a court of competent jurisdiction has declared\u00a0 otherwise.<br\/><br\/>The defendants are hereby declared the owners of the money deposited in court in this action, together with interest thereon up to the time of tender, and the 'plaintiff is declared the owner of the lands described in this action free from all liens, charges, or incumbrances arising by virtue of the agreement between him and Narciso L.

TOMAS CELOSIA ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TORRES, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal through a bill of exceptions, by the defendant Tomas Celosia from a judgment of September 28, 1911, wherein Judge Jose C. Abreu ordered the defendant to restore to the plaintiff possession of the land described in the complaint, to refrain from troubling or disturbing the plaintiff in his possession of the property, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>On March 20, 1911, counsel for Pedro del Rosario filed a written complaint with the Court of First Instance of Bohol and alleged, among other things, that the plaintiff was the owner and proprietor of a piece of agricultural land, one-half of which he had acquired by original cultivation and exclusive, public and peaceable possession for about thirty years, and the other half by purchase on August 10, 1881; that the said land was situated in the place called Cabiguan, barrio of Pangoan, now Buenavista, of the pueblo of Jetafe, Province of Bohol, with an area of 17 hectares, 18 ares and 8 centiares, bounded on the north and east by government lands, and on the south and west by a mangrove swamp; that, on January\u00a0 19, 1911, up to which\u00a0 date the plaintiff had for about thirty years been holding the said land as the owner thereof, the defendant Tomas Celosia did, without just or lawful reason, usurp and appropriate to himself the property in question and refused to return it to the plaintiff, notwithstanding the friendly demands so to do made upon him; that, on January 24, 1911, the plaintiff brought an action against the said defendant, in the justice of the peace court of Jetafe, because of such usurpation, but the justice of the peace, on March 10 of the same year, pronounced a judgment of acquittal unwarranted in law; that the plaintiff had, by reason of the said usurpation, suffered losses and damages estimated at P350, and that other important losses and damages might result by the usurper's continuance in possession during the pendency of this case.\u00a0 Said counsel therefore prayed that the defendant be sentenced to recognize the plaintiff's right to the possession and ownership of the land and to pay an indemnity of P350 and the costs.\u00a0 He further petitioned the court to issue a preliminary injunction against the defendant to restrain him until the final decision of this suit.<br\/><br\/>Counsel for the defendant denied each and all of the facts set out in the complaint and in special defense alleged that Isidoro Celosia and Macario Torregosa, whose true surname was also Celosia, had erroneously been included in the complaint; that these parties had no interest whatever in the present suit, as they were mere witnesses of the defendant; that Tomas Celosia had been from time immemorial, the owner and possessor of the land described in the complaint, and that the plaintiff had never been in possession thereof.\u00a0 He therefore asked that judgment be rendered in his client's behalf by absolving him from the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.<br\/><br\/>Upon the hearing of the case, on September 22, 1911, and the production of evidence by both parties, the aforementioned judgment was rendered.<br\/><br\/>The action brought in this case by counsel for Pedro del Rosario is unquestionably one for recovery of possession and cannot be confused with the so-called plenary action for possession, which may be instituted even one year following the usurpation and has for its sole object the recovery of possession by the person who legitimately enjoyed it before he was despoiled thereof; while in the\u00a0 complaint filed by the said Rosario it is contended that the defendant should recognize the plaintiff's ownership and possession of the land sought to be recovered, that is, his control over it, for the reason that the plaintiff is its lawful owner.<br\/><br\/>The fact is established in this case and admitted by both parties that the plaintiff brought suit before the justice of the peace of Jetafe for the restitution of possession of this same land, on the allegation that it was detained and usurped by the defendant Tomas Celosia; but that court, deeming such demand improper, absolved the defendant from the complaint.\u00a0 The record does not show that the plaintiff appealed from that ruling of the Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>After the judgment of the justice of the peace of Jetafe had become final, the plaintiff brought suit in the Court of First Instance in an action for the recovery of possession, whereby the present case was properly instituted, for after the justice of the peace had by a ruling of a final character denied the right of action for the restitution of possession of the land, there could only have been brought, as the plaintiff did bring, the proper action for recovery founded on the alleged right of control over the litigated property, and it is to be noted that in the juridical conception of dominion or control over a thing is comprised that of its ownership and possession.<br\/><br\/>Since a judgment that became executory was rendered by the justice\u00a0 of the peace of Jetafe upon the question at issue, relative to the detention or usurpation of the land in dispute, it is no longer permissible to bring a plenary action for possession, which lies only in the case where more than one year has elapsed since the date of the usurpation (art. 460, No. 4, Civil Code), as the action for restitution of possession, provided in section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, is no longer applicable and because only that plenary action lies in behalf of the lawful possessor or person deprived of his possession.<br\/><br\/>The fact is that an action was brought in this case for recovery of possession, of the land in litigation, and for its successful issue it was indispensable that the plaintiff's ownership of the land should have been proven.\u00a0 This was not done.<br\/><br\/>In the judgment appealed from it is recognized that none of the litigants proved title to the said property, and the testimony taken at the trial does not show that the plaintiff is the owner of the land in question; and, as the final judgment of the justice of the peace acquitted the defendant, who was charged with usurping and detaining the land\u2014an acquittal which implies that there was no such usurpation on January 19, 1911, as charged in the complaint\u2014it is of course to be presumed that the defendant was in possession of the said land even before that date, though he did not prove his right of ownership of the land under a satisfactory title.<br\/><br\/>The defendant somehow succeeded in proving by witnesses that his father, Hermenegildo Celosia, held the land in question more than thirty years ago, and that upon his father's death, he entered into and continued in possession of the property.\u00a0 On the other hand, it was proved that the land which Pedro Caina sold to the plaintiff, Pedro del Rosario, is different from that now held by the defendant, which is situated in the place called Cabiguan, while the land claimed by the plaintiff and acquired by him from Pedro Caina is located in the place known as Maubit, far from Cabiguan.<br\/><br\/>At all events, the ruling in the judgment appealed from being restricted solely to the question of possession of the land in dispute, leaving therein undecided the question of ownership, the sole object of the action brought for recovery, as the\u00a0 trial judge did not consider it to have been duly proved, it would be improper to affirm the said judgment, since the matter of the restitution of possession therein ordered has already been\u00a0 finally decided by the justice of the peace adversely to the plaintiff's claim, and the law does not warrant the allowance in this case of a restitution of possession which was disallowed by another competent judge in a final judgment, especially in behalf of the plaintiff, who has not proved his ownership of the land which he tries to recover.<br\/><br\/>Article 446 of the Civil Code prescribes:\u00a0 \"Every possessor has a right to be respected in his possession; etc.\"<br\/><br\/>As it was proved at trial that Tomas Celosia was then in possession of the land in question, and it was not shown by the plaintiff that Celosia usurped this property, both law and justice\u00a0 require that he be protected in his rights and respected in the possession he enjoys of the land in litigation.\u00a0 In a judgment rendered in a case initiated through an action for recovery, when it is held therein that the ownership claimed has not been duly proven, it is improper to order the restitution of possession, particularly when such restitution has already been denied by a judgment that has become final, because to do so would be tantamount to a re judgment of a matter once tried and decided.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from is hereby reversed and the defendant, Tomas Celosia, is absolved from the complaint; without express finding as to costs.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Moir, after hearing the evidence,\u00a0 found that the defendant had a better right to the land described in the complaint than the plaintiff, and rendered a judgment absolving the defendant from all liability under the complaint, with costs against the plaintiff.\u00a0 From that sentence the plaintiff appealed and in this court made the following assignments of error:<br\/><blockquote>\"1. In permitting the defendant to submit secondary evidence regarding the contents of an alleged document of pledge or sale with right to repurchase, said to have been executed by Damaso Ricafort in defendant's favor in the year 1901, when the destruction or disappearance of said document had not been previously proven.<br\/><br\/>\"2. In stating in the judgment appealed from that the plaintiff presented a motion in the justice of the peace court of Ligao with reference to possession of the land and as a result of this action\u00a0 the deputy sheriff of Ligao entered into possession of the land in question; it appears from the evidence that this possession so given to the plaintiff was effected at the time of the harvest of the years 1908 to 1909, which continued from the latter part of November to the latter part of January; although the truth as derived from the evidence is that the action was instituted by the plaintiff in the justice of the peace court of the municipality of Oas, and the possession mentioned was given by the deputy sheriff of Oas, in the month of January of the year 1908.<br\/><br\/>\"3. In holding that the defendant is the\u00a0 possessor in good faith of the land in question and that he took possession of said land without knowledge of\u00a0 the plaintiff's rights.<br\/><br\/>\"4. In holding that the defendant has a better right to the land in question because of his possession previous to the plaintiff, despite the circumstance that the plaintiff has her title registered in the property registry and the defendant has no title of any kind.<br\/><br\/>\"5. In rendering judgment for the defendant and against the plaintiff, sentencing the latter to pay the costs of the trial.\"<\/blockquote>With reference to the first assignment\u00a0 of error, the appellant contends, relying\u00a0 upon section 321 of Act No. 190, that the lower court committed an error in admitting secondary proof of the contents of a lost document or writing.\u00a0 That part of section 321 relating to the question presented by the appellant says:<br\/><blockquote>\"If it (the writing or document) has been lost, proof of the loss must first be made, before evidence can be given of its contents.\u00a0 Upon such proof being made, together with proof of the due execution of the writing, its contents may be proved by a copy or by a recital of its contents in some authentic document or by the recollection of a witness.\"<\/blockquote>In the present case the defendant testified that the document in question was burned at the\u00a0 time his house was destroyed by fire.\u00a0 There is absolutely no proof in the record contradicting the declaration of the defendant.\u00a0 The fact, therefore, that the document in question was burned stands proved, without any contradiction.\u00a0 The fact that the document in question was executed is supported, not only by the declaration of the defendant, but by the declaration of Damaso Ricafort.\u00a0 In addition\u00a0 to the declarations of these persons with reference to the\u00a0 execution of said document, the defendant attempted to prove its contents by the presentation of a document (Exhibit 4) executed by the original parties, after the burning of the first, which pretends to be a true copy of the original.\u00a0 There seems to be no reason in the record why\u00a0 the court should have disbelieved, in the absence of any testimony to the contrary, the statement of Roman Jaucian, that the document\u00a0 in question had been burned.\u00a0 That fact having been established, the testimony admitted by the lower court relating to the contents of the document was admissible and no error was committed by the court with reference to the same.<br\/><br\/>The second assignment of error relates only to a possible mistake in naming the municipality in which certain proceedings had been had before the justice of the peace.\u00a0 Admitting that there was a mistake, in our judgment, and we are supported in this by the appellant himself, this can have no effect upon the conclusion reached by the lower court.<br\/><br\/>In our judgment the third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error may be considered together.<br\/><br\/>The important facts relating to these assignments of error may be stated briefly as follows: <ol> <li>It appears from the record that in the month of August, 1901, by a <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, a private document, Damaso Ricafort sold to the said Roman Jaucian, thirty-six parcels of land, which are particularly described in Exhibit 4; that the six parcels of land in question in the present action were included in said thirty-six\u00a0 parcels.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That in the year 1903, the said Damaso Ricafort sold to Osmundo\u00a0 Roa the six parcels of land involved in the present action, under a mortgage or pledge or <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, a private document.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That in the month of August, 1906, the said Damaso Ricafort sold to Elisa\u00a0 Veguillas, the plaintiff herein, the six parcels of land, by a <i>pacto de retro<\/i>, a public document; that said document\u00a0 was duly annotated in the registry on the 25th day of October, 1909, as well as on the 10th day of March, 1910.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That in the year 1907, Roman Jaucian redeemed the six parcels of land in question from Osmundo Roa, which the latter had purchased from Damaso Ricafort in the year 1903, and went into possession and remained in possession of the same until January 18, 1908, when he was dispossessed by an order of the justice of the peace.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That Roman Jaucian, the defendant herein, later obtained possession of said parcel of land and has been in possession of the same ever since, claiming to be the owner thereof.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>That in the year 1908, the said Damaso Ricafort failed to pay to the plaintiff herein, Elisa Veguillas, the interest dire upon the contract or <i>pacto de retro<\/i> between them, and the said Elisa Veguillas commenced an action before the justice of the peace of the municipality of Oas, for the purpose of obtaining possession of the six parcels of land in question, under and by virtue of the <i>pacto de retro<\/i> executed by Damaso Ricafort to the plaintiff herein on the 19th of August, 1906.\u00a0 The justice of the peace ordered the possession turned over to the plaintiff herein, which order was duly executed.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>It is admitted that at the time the defendant Roman Jaucian redeemed the interest which the said Osmundo Roa had in said six parcels of land, in the year 1907, and took possession of the said land, he had\u00a0 no knowledge or information concerning said pacto de retro between Damaso Ricafort and the plaintiff herein.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The fact is also admitted that at\u00a0 the time the <i>pactos de retro<\/i> of the month of August, 1906, was executed and delivered between Roman Ricafort and the plaintiff herein, the latter had no knowledge or information concerning the existence of the other two contracts or pactps de retro, which the said Damaso Ricafort had made with reference to the said land, to the defendant herein, in the year 1901, and the one in favor of Osmundo Roa in the year 1903.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>The lower court relying upon the foregoing facts and the provisions of article 1473 of the Civil Code, reached the conclusion that the defendant, Roman Jaucian, had a better right to the land in question than the plaintiff, and so decided.\u00a0 The appellant contends that the lower court committed an error in his interpretation or application of said article 1473.\u00a0 Said article 1473 provides that:<br\/><blockquote>\"When the same thing has been sold to different vendees, the ownership shall be transferred to the person who first took possession of it in good faith, if the thing is personal.<br\/><br\/>\"When the thing is a piece of real property, it shall belong to the person acquiring it who first inscribed it in the registry.<br\/><br\/>\"When there is no inscription, the property shall belong to the person who first took possession of it in good faith, and, in default of said possession, to the person who presents the oldest title, provided there is good faith.\"<\/blockquote><\/li><\/ol>It is admitted that at the time Roman Jaucian went into possession of the six parcels of land, after he had redeemed the same from Osmundo Roa, he did so in good faith, being ignorant of the contract between Elisa Veguillas and Damaso Ricafort.\u00a0 His title was also older than that of Elisa Veguillas.\u00a0 His title being older and having obtained possession in good faith, under the provisions of paragraph 3 of said article 1473, he is the owner of the property in question, unless the <i>alleged<\/i> registry of the property made by Elisa Veguillas on\u00a0 the 25th of October, 1909, and on the 10th of March, 1910, had the effect of defeating his title.\u00a0 Paragraph 2 of article 1473 gives the land, when it has been sold to two persons, to the one who first acquires the registration of the same.\u00a0 The defendant, Roman Jaucian, makes no pretension that he had his title registered.\u00a0 Some question is raised whether the plaintiff, Elisa Veguillas, had her title duly\u00a0 registered-whether or not what she <i>did<\/i> amounted to a registration of her title.\u00a0 The plaintiff alleges in paragraph 3 of her complaint that:\u00a0 \"Said instrument of sale was annotated preventatively in the property registry under date of October 25, 1909.\"<br\/><br\/>The trial judge found, as a matter of fact, from the proof adduced during the trial, that the title of the plaintiff \"was inscribed in the property registry of this province, on October 25, 1909.\"\u00a0 (Paragraph 5\u00a0 of decision.)<br\/><br\/>In view of the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of said article 1473 of the Civil Code, it becomes most important to ascertain whether Elisa Veguillas actually had her title registered or whether it was simply a <i>preventative precautionary notice,<\/i><i>preventative precautionary notice,<\/i> and if she failed to secure the\u00a0 actual registry within thirty days thereafter (paragraph 2,\u00a0 article 17, Mortgage Law) such preventative precautionary notice did not make her the owner.\u00a0 The <i>preventative precautionary notice<\/i> only availed to protect her rights for a period of\u00a0 thirty days.\u00a0 (Paragraph 2, article 17,\u00a0 Mortgage Law.)\u00a0 And, moreover, if what was done by the plaintiff only amounted to a preventative precautionary notice, <i>it would only protect her<\/i> rights against interests or rights subsequently acquired.\u00a0 It could not have the\u00a0 effect of defeating interests or rights acquired theretofore.\u00a0 (Article 71, Mortgage Law.)\u00a0 The actual registration of the title only could do that.\u00a0 Don Odriozola, in discussing the effect of a <i>preventative precautionary notice<\/i>, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"While article 71 of the Law guarantees the right of the person who has secured an annotation, such precept cannot be held to contradict the provisions of article 20 of the same law, <i>nor may it be deduced therefrom that the annotations confer upon the' person making them a right<\/i> to the property annotated preferential to rights previously acquired and inscribed.\"\u00a0 (<i>Diccionario de Jurisprudencia<\/i>, p. 47.)<\/blockquote>A <i>preventative precautionary notice<\/i> only protects the interests and rights of the person who secures it against those who acquire an interest in the property subsequent thereto, and then only for a period of thirty days.\u00a0 It\u00a0 cannot affect the rights or interests of persons acquired theretofore.\u00a0 While, on the other hand, if one of the different purchasers of the same tract or parcel of land has secured the actual registration of his title before the other purchaser, he thereby becomes the real owner as against other purchasers of the same property.\u00a0 (Paragraph 2, article 1473.)<br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, and as was said above, it becomes very important to determine what was the effect of the <i>alleged<\/i> registration or notice in the registry, secured by the plaintiff.\u00a0 Upon a careful examination of said note or notice, made by the registrar of property of the Province of Albay, on the 25th of October, 1909, and on the 10th of March, 1910, we find, upon an examination of the document Exhibit A (the contract between the plaintiff and Damaso Ricafort), that on the 25th of October, 1909, the registrar of property of the Province of Albay made the following memorandum upon said document:\u00a0 \"the foregoing instrument annotated, etc.,\" and on the 10th of March, 1910, the said registrar made a further note to the same effect.\u00a0 A <i>marginal memorandum<\/i> of said annotation was also made on the original document itself.\u00a0 We think that what was done with respect to said entries or annotations and marginal notes amounted to a registration of the property in favor of the plaintiff, Elisa Veguillas.\u00a0 The plaintiff having secured the registration of her title first, she has a preferred right over the other purchaser (the defendant), whose title had not been registered.\u00a0 This is true, even though the latter was in the actual possession of the land.\u00a0 (Paragraph 2, article 1473.)\u00a0 Under the provisions of said article (1473), in the case of two purchasers of the same parcel of land, the registration in favor of one defeats the possession on the part of the other.\u00a0 More credit is given to registration than to actual possession.<br\/><br\/>With reference to damages for the occupation of the land in question caused by the defendant, the plaintiff claims the sum of P200 damages for each of the years 1908 and 1909, making a total of P400 damages.\u00a0 It was proven during the trial that the share of\u00a0 the crops belonging to the owner amounted to about P200 per year.\u00a0 That being true, the value of the crops to the owner of the land for two years would amount to P400.\u00a0 It will be remembered, however, that in 1907, Roman Jaucian, the defendant, entered into the possession of the property without having any knowledge or information concerning the claim or interest of the plaintiff in said property.\u00a0 It will be remembered also that he was ousted of his possession by an order of the justice of the peace in January, 1908, and that he again entered into possession of the property (the record not disclosing exactly in what manner) and harvested the crops for the year 1909.\u00a0 It will also be remembered that the plaintiff did not consummate her title by the registration of the same until the month of October, 1909.\u00a0 The registration was not made until the month of October, 1909.\u00a0 The title of the plaintiff was not perfected until such registration.\u00a0 It is also true that in the absence of such registration, the defendant being a prior purchaser and in possession of the property, he was entitled to occupy the same as owner and to reap the crops.\u00a0 (Paragraph 3, article 1473.)\u00a0 The question then presents itself-under these facts-the defendant being an occupant in good faith and the plaintiff not having perfected her title until after the crops had been harvested, for which she claims damages, is the plaintiff entitled to recover damages for such alleged illegal occupancy on the part of the defendant?\u00a0 The defendant being an occupant in good faith and having collected the crops believing that he was the owner of the property, the plaintiff cannot recover damages for the same.\u00a0 (Articles 451, 452, 453, Civil Code.)<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the lower court must be reversed, and without any finding as to costs it is hereby ordered that a judgment be entered declaring that the plaintiff is the owner and entitled to the immediate possession of the six parcels of land described in paragraph 2 of the complaint.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

I., the said accused did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously have in his possession and under his control one-half gram of opium; contrary to law.\"<br\/><br\/>It appears that defendant's premises were searched by police officers on the 19th day of April, 1913, and that as a result of the search eight small tins and a match box containing in all about one-half a gram of opium were found in the attic, rolled up in a <i>petate<\/i>, and secreted upon some boards laid loosely across the rafters.\u00a0 It is not quite clear from the evidence how much of the drug was found in the different receptacles, but it does appear that a little was found in each of the seven tins and also in the match box, and it is very evident that the amount found in any one of them must have been very small indeed.\u00a0 Indeed it is very doubtful whether any greater amount of opium was found in any one of the receptacles than one might expect to find sticking to the sides and bottom of a carelessly emptied can or box containing the drug.<br\/><br\/>The defendant testified that the tins and the box did not belong to him and that he did not know that they contained opium; that they had been left in the attic by a Chinaman named Lee Uy, who formerly lived in the house, but who had gone to China some two months prior to the search; that he had been absent in the provinces for about ten months before Lee Uy left for China; and that during that time Lee Uy occupied the premises and had charge of his <i>tienda<\/i>.\u00a0 His testimony stands uncontradicted, and is\u00a0 in some respects corroborated by the testimony of one of the police officers who said that the place where the tins were found was covered with dust, and apparently unused and neglected.<br\/><br\/>We are of opinion that the evidence introduced at the trial is not sufficient to sustain a conviction.\u00a0 It is true that the statute penalizes the\u00a0 unauthorized possession of opium on one's person or on one's premises, and that we have held that it matters not how\u00a0 small the quantity of the contraband drug may be, if one knowingly has it in his possession or control he is guilty of a violation of the statute (U. S. <i>vs<\/i>. Lim Poco, 25 Phil. Rep., 84)\u00a0 But in that case as well as in the cases of the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Tan Tayco (12 Phil. Rep., 739), and the United States <i>vs<\/i>. Tin Masa (17 Phil. Rep., 463), we held that in no case could a conviction of unlawful possession of opium be sustained where it appears that the <i>animus possidendi<\/i> is absent, or that the defendant was not aware that the prohibited drug was in his possession or on his premises and under his control.\u00a0 And it may well happen that the fact that the amount of opium found in the possession of an accused person is very small will be sufficient, under all the circumstances of a particular case, when taken together with his denial of knowledge of the\u00a0 fact that he had it in his possession, to sustain a finding that the <i>animus possidendi<\/i> is absent.\u00a0 We are of opinion, and so hold, that in the case at bar, the insignificant amount of the drug which was found in the receptacles left in defendant's attic by a former occupant of the house, taken together with defendant's denials of knowledge that opium would be found in these apparently empty receptacles, is sufficient under all the circumstances of this case to justify and require a holding that the <i>animus possidendi <\/i>was absent, and that the defendant is not guilty of the offense with which he is charged.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the lower court convicting and sentencing the defendant and appellant should therefore be reversed and he should be acquitted of the offense with which he is charged in the information, with the costs in both instances <i>de oficio<\/i>.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

S. Crossfield, judge, overruled the demurrer to the first cause of action, but sustained that to the second.\u00a0 Counsel for the plaintiff entered an exception to this order in so far as it sustained the demurrer interposed by the defendant to the second cause\u00a0 of action.<br\/><br\/>By his written answer to the complaint, on July 19, 1911, counsel for the defendant, reserving his exception to the order of the court overruling his demurrer filed against the first cause of action, denied each and all of the allegations contained in the complaint, relative to such first cause of action.<br\/><br\/>As a special defense of the latter, he set forth that the plaintiff had no contract whatever with the defendant in which any period of time was stipulated during which the former was to render his services as manager of the La Insular factory; that the defendant revoked for just cause the power conferred\u00a0 upon the plaintiff; that subsequent to the revocation of such power, and on\u00a0 the occasion of the plaintiff's having sold all his rights and interests in the business of the La Insular factory to the defendant, in consideration of the\u00a0 sum received by him, the plaintiff renounced all action, intervention and claim that he might have against the defendant relative to the business aforementioned, whereby all the questions that might have arisen between them were settled.<br\/><br\/>On December 19, 1911, counsel for each of the parties presented to the court a stipulation of the following purport:<br\/><blockquote>\"In clause 11 of the will executed by Don Joaquin Santa Marina y Perez in Madrid before a notary public on August 4, 1901, and duly legalized in these Islands, there appears the following:<br\/><br\/>\" 'The testator provides that the testamentary executor who is holding office as such shall enjoy a salary, allotment, or emolument of 4,000 pesos per annum which shall be paid out of the testator's estate; but that in case of consultation, the testamentary executors consulted shall not be entitled to this allotment, nor to any other, on account of such consultation.' \"<\/blockquote>According to the statement of the sums collected by Antonio M.a Barretto as the judicial administrator of the estate of Joaquin Santa Marina from November, 1908, to March, 1910, and during twenty-three days of April of the latter year, the total amount so collected was P5,923.28.<br\/><br\/>Antonio M.a Barretto ceased to manage the La Insular factory, as the judicial administrator of the estate of the deceased Joaquin Santa Marina, in October, 1909, and not on November 7, 1908, as erroneously set out in the stenographic notes.<br\/><br\/>The remuneration paid to Barretto as judicial administrator of the estate of Santa Marina was independent of that which pertained to him for his services as manager of the La Insular factory both before and after the date on which he ceased to administer the said factory as\u00a0 such judicial administrator.<br\/><br\/>In the stipulation before mentioned there also appears the following:\u00a0 \"The facts above stated are true, but there is a controversy between the attorneys for the plaintiff and the defendant, as to whether such facts are relevant as evidence in the said case.\u00a0 They therefore submit this question to the court and if it determines that they are relevant as evidence they should be admitted as such, with exception by the defendant, but if it determines that they are\u00a0 not relevant as evidence they should be excluded, with exception by the plaintiff.\"<br\/><br\/>After the hearing of the case, with the introduction of evidence by both parties, the court, on January 17, 1912, rendered the judgment aforementioned, to which an exception was taken by counsel for the plaintiff, who by written motion asked that the said judgment be set aside and a new trial granted, because such judgment was not sufficiently warranted by the evidence and was contrary to law and because the findings of fact therein contained were openly and manifestly contrary to the\u00a0 weight of the evidence.\u00a0 This motion was denied, with exception by the plaintiff.\u00a0 By an order of the 5th of the following month of February, issued in view of a petition presented by counsel for the plaintiff, the court dismissed the second cause of action set out in the complaint, to which order said counsel likewise excepted.<br\/><br\/>Upon presentation of the proper bill of exceptions, the same was approved, certified, and forwarded to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>Demand is made in this suit for the payment of the considerable sum of P137,000, together with the legal interest thereon.\u00a0 Two amounts make up this sum:\u00a0 One of P37,000, as salary for the year 1910, claimed to be due for services rendered by the plaintiff as agent and manager of the tobacco factory known as La Insular; and the other of P100,000, as an indemnity for losses and damages, on account of the plaintiff's removal without just cause\u00a0 from his position as agent and\u00a0 manager of said factory, effected arbitrarily and in violation of the contract of hire of services between the parties, the plaintiff claiming to be still entitled to hold the position from which he was dismissed.<br\/><br\/>The most important fact in this case, which stands out prominently\u00a0 from the evidence regarded as a whole, is that of the plaintiff Barretto's renunciation or resignation of the position he held as agent and manager of the said factory, which was freely and voluntarily made by him on the occasion of the insolvency and disappearance of the Chinaman Uy Yan, who had bought from the factory products aggregating in value the considerable sum of P97,000 and, without paying this large debt, disappeared and has not been seen since.<br\/><br\/>Antonio M.a Barretto, the agent and manager of the said factory, said among other things the following, in the letter, Exhibit 3, addressed by him to Jose Santa Marina, on January 2, 1909:<br\/><blockquote>\"I have to report to you an exceedingly disagreeable matter.\u00a0 This Chinaman Uy Yan, with whose name I begin this\u00a0 paragraph, has failed and owes the factory the considerable sum of P97,000.\u00a0 We will see what I can get from him, although when these Chinamen fail it is because they have spent everything.\u00a0 I have turned the matter over to my attorney in order that he may sue the party.\u00a0 I am not attempting to make light of this matter.\u00a0 I acknowledge that I have been rather more generous with this fellow than I should have been; but this is the way of doing business here.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *<br\/><br\/>\"I have always thought that when the manager of a business trips up in a matter like this he should tender his resignation, and I still think so.\u00a0 The position is at your disposal to do as you like.\"<\/blockquote>This letter is authentic and was neither denied nor rejected by the plaintiff, Barretto.<br\/><br\/>Although Santa Marina did not immediately reply and tell him what opinion he may have formed and the decision he had reached in the matter, it is no less true that the silence and lack of reply on the part of the chief owner of the factory were sufficient indications that the resignation had been virtually accepted and that if he did not reply immediately it was because he intended to act cautiously.\u00a0 As the addressee, the chief owner of the factory, knew of no one at that time whom he could appoint to relieve the writer, who had resigned, it was to be presumed that he was thereafter looking for some trustworthy person who might substitute the plaintiff in his position of agent and\u00a0 manager of the factory, for in fact eleven months afterwards the defendant communicated to the plaintiff that he had revoked the power conferred upon him and had appointed Mr:\u00a0 J. McGavin to substitute him in his position of manager of the La Insular factory, whereby the plaintiff's resignation, tendered in his aforesaid letter of January 2, 1909, Exhibit 3, was expressly accepted.<br\/><br\/>After the plaintiff had resigned the position he held, and notwithstanding the lapse of several months before its express acceptance, it cannot be understood that he has any right to demand an indemnity for losses and damages particularly since he ostensibly and frankly acknowledged that he had been negligent in the discharge of his duties and that he had overstepped his authority in the management of the factory, with respect to the Chinaman\u00a0 mentioned.\u00a0 The record does not show that Santa Marina, his principal, required him to resign his position as manager, but\u00a0 that Barretto himself voluntarily stated by letter to his principal that, for the reasons therein mentioned, he resigned and placed at the latter's disposal the position of agent and manager of the La Insular factory; and if the principal, Santa Marina, deemed it suitable to relieve the agent, for having been negligent and overstepping his authority in the discharge of his office, and furthermore because of his having expressly resigned his position, and placed it at the disposal of the chief owner of the business, it cannot be explained how such person can be entitled to demand an indemnity for losses and damages, from his principal, who merely exercised his lawful right of relieving the plaintiff from the position which he had voluntarily given up.<br\/><br\/>So, the agent and manager Barretto was not really dismissed or removed by the defendant Santa Marina.\u00a0 What did occur was that, in view of the resignation tendered by the plaintiff for the reasons which he himself conscientiously deemed to warrant his\u00a0 surrender of the position he was holding in the La Insular factory, the principal owner\u00a0 of this establishment, the defendant Santa Marina, had to look for and appoint another agent and manager to relieve and substitute him in the said employment\u2014a lawful act performed by the principal owner of the factory and one which cannot serve as a ground upon which to demand from the latter an indemnity for losses and damages, inasmuch as, in view of the facts that occurred and were acknowledged and confessed by Barretto in his letters, Exhibits 3 and 6, the plaintiff could not expect, nor ought to have expected, that the defendant should have insisted on the unsuccessful agent's continuance in his position, or that he should not have accepted the resignation tendered by the plaintiff in his first letter.\u00a0 By the mere fact that the defendant remained silent and designated another person, Mr. J. McGavin, to discharge in the plaintiff's stead the powers and duties of agent and manager of the said factory, Barretto should have understood that his resignation had been accepted and that if its acceptance was not communicated to him immediately it was owing to the circumstance that the principal owner of the factory did not then have; nor until several months afterwards, any other person whom he could appoint and place in his stead, for, as soon as the defendant Santa Marina could appoint the said McGavin, he revoked the power he had conferred upon the plaintiff and communicated this fact to the latter, by means of the letter, Exhibit D, which was presented to him by the bearer thereof, McGavin himself, the new manager and agent appointed.<br\/><br\/>Omitting consideration for the moment of the first error attributed to the trial judge by his sustaining the demurrer filed against the second cause of action, relative to the collection of P100,000 as the amount of the losses and damages occasioned to the plaintiff, and turning our attention to the second error imputed to him by his refusal to sentence the defendant, for the first cause of action, to the payment of P37,000 or of any sum over P3,083.33, we shall proceed to examine the question whether any period or term for the duration of the position of agent and manager was fixed in the verbal contract made between the deceased Joaquin Santa Marina, the defendant's predecessor in interest, and the plaintiff Antonio M.a Barrettoj\u2014a contract which, after Joaquin Santa Marina's death, was ratified by his brother and heir, the defendant Jose Santa Marina.<br\/><br\/>The defendant acknowledged the said verbal contract and also its ratification by him after his brother's death; but he denied any stipulation therein that Barretto should hold his office for any specific period of time fixed by and between the contracting parties, for the deceased Joaquin Santa Marina, in conferring power upon the plaintiff, did not do so for any specific time, nor did he set any period within which he should hold his office of agent and manager of the La Insular factory; neither did he fix the date for the termination of such services, in the instrument of power of attorney executed by the defendant Santa Marina before a notary on the 25th of September, 1908.\u00a0 (Record, p. 20.)<br\/><br\/>From the context of the instrument just mentioned it can not be concluded that any time whatever was fixed during which the plaintiff should hold\u00a0 his position of agent.\u00a0 The defendant, in executing that instrument, whereby the agreement made between his brother Joaquin and Barretto was ratified, did no more than accord to the plaintiff the same confidence that the defendant's\u00a0 predecessor in interest had in him; and so long as this merely subjective condition of trust lodged in the agent existed, the time during which the latter might hold his office could be considered indefinite or undetermined, but as soon as that indispensable condition of a power of attorney disappeared and the conduct of the agent ceased to inspire confidence, the principal had a right to revoke the power he had conferred upon his agent, especially when the latter, for good reasons, gave up the office he was\u00a0 holding.<br\/><br\/>Article 1733 of the Civil Code, applicable to the case at bar, according to the provisions of article 2 of the Code of Commerce, prescribes:\u00a0 \"The principal may, at his will, revoke the power and compel the agent to return the instrument containing the same in which the authority was given.\"<br\/><br\/>Article 279 of the Code of Commerce provides:\u00a0 \"The principal may revoke the commission intrusted to an agent at any stage of the transaction, advising him thereof, but always being liable for the result of the transactions which took place before the latter was informed of the revocation.\"<br\/><br\/>From the above legal provisions it is clearly to be inferred that the contract of agency can subsist only so long as the principal has confidence in his agent, because, from the moment such confidence disappears and although there be a fixed period for the exercise of the office of agent, a circumstance that does not appear in the present case, the principal has a perfect right to revoke the power that he had conferred upon the\u00a0 agent owing to the confidence he had in him and which for sound reasons had ceased to exist.<br\/><br\/>The record does not show it to have\u00a0 been duly proved, notwithstanding the plaintiff's allegation, that a period was fixed for holding his agency or office of agent and manager of the La Insular factory.\u00a0 It would\u00a0 be improper, for the purpose of supplying such defect, to apply to the present case the provisons of article 1128 of the Civil Code.\u00a0 This article relates to obligations for which no period has been fixed for their fulfillment, but which, from their nature and circumstances, allow the inference that there was an intention to grant such period to the debtor, wherefore the courts are authorized to fix the duration of the same, and the reason why it is inapplicable is that the rights and obligations existing between Barretto and Santa Marina are absolutely different from those to which it refers, for, according to article 1732 of the Civil Code, agency is terminated:<br\/><blockquote>\"1.\u00a0 By revocation.<br\/><br\/>\"2.\u00a0 By withdrawal of the agent.<br\/><br\/>\"3.\u00a0 By death, interdiction, bankruptcy, or insolvency of the principal or of the agent.\"<\/blockquote>It is not incumbent upon the courts to fix the period during which contracts for services shall last.\u00a0 Their duration is understood to be implicitly fixed, in default of express stipulation, by the period for the payment of the salary of the employee.\u00a0 Therefore the doctrine of the tacit renewal of leases of property, established in article 1566 of the Civil Code, is not applicable to the case at bar.\u00a0 And even though the annual salary fixed for the services to be rendered by the plaintiff as agent and manager of the La Insular factory, was P37,000, yet, in accordance with the custom universally observed throughout the world, salaries fixed for the year are collected and paid in monthly installments as they fall due, and\u00a0 so the plaintiff collected and was paid his remuneration; therefore, on the latter's discontinuance in his office as agent, he would at most be entitled to the salary for one month and some odd days, allowed in the judgment of the lower court.<br\/><br\/>Article 302 of the Code of Commerce reads thus:<br\/><blockquote>\"In cases in which no special time is fixed in the contracts of service, any one of the parties thereto may dissolve it, advising the other party thereof one month in advance.<br\/><br\/>\"The factor or shop clerk shall be entitled, in such case, to the salary due for one month.\"<\/blockquote>From the mere fact that the principal no longer had confidence in the agent, he is entitled to withdraw it and to revoke the power he conferred upon the latter, even before the expiration of the period of the engagement or of the agreement made between them; but, in the present case, once it has been shown that, between the deceased Joaquin Santa Marina and the latter's heir, now the defendant, on the one hand, and the plaintiff Barretto, on the other, no period whatever was stipulated during which the last-named should hold the office of agent and manager of the said factory, it is unquestionable that the defendant, even without good reasons, could lawfully revoke the power conferred upon the plaintiff and appoint in his place Mr. McGavin, and thereby contracted no liability whatever other than the obligation to pay the plaintiff the salary pertaining to one month and some odd days, as held in the judgment below.<br\/><br\/>Barretto himself acknowledged in his aforesaid letter, Exhibit 3, that he had exceeded his authority and acted negligently in selling on credit to the said Chinaman a large quantity of the products of the factory under the plaintiff's management, reaching the considerable value of P97,000; whereby he confessed one of the\u00a0 causes which led to his removal, the revocation of the power conferred upon him and the appointment of a new agent in his place.<br\/><br\/>The defendant, Jose Sanba Marina, in his letter of December 2, 1909, whereby he communicated to the plaintiff the revocation of the power he had conferred upon him and the appointment of another new agent, Mr. McGavin, stated among other things that the loan contracted by the agent Barretto, without the approval of the principal, caused a great panic among the stockholders of the factory and that the defendant hoped to allay it by the\u00a0 new measure that he expected to adopt. This, then, was still another reason that induced the principal to withdraw the confidence placed in the plaintiff and to revoke the power he had conferred upon him.\u00a0 Therefore, even omitting consideration of the resignation before mentioned, we find duly warranted the reasons which impelled the defendant to revoke the said power and relieve\u00a0 the plaintiff from the position of agent and manager of the La Insular factory.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with the provisions of article 283 of the Code of Commerce, the manager of an enterprise or manufacturing or commercial establishment, authorized to administer it and direct it, with more or less powers, as the owner may have considered advisable, shall have the legal qualifications of an agent.<br\/><br\/>Article 300 of the same code prescribes:\u00a0 \"The following shall be special reasons for which principals may discharge their employees, even though the time of service of the contract has not\u00a0 elapsed:\u00a0 Fraud or breach of trust in the business intrusted to them\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 \"<br\/><br\/>By reason of these legal provisions the defendant, in revoking the\u00a0 authority\u00a0 conferred upon the plaintiff, acted within his unquestionable powers and did not thereby violate any statute whatever that may have limited them consequently, he could not have caused the plaintiff any harm or detriment to his rights and interests, for not only had Santa Marina a justifiable reason to proceed as he did, but also no period whatever had been stipulated\u00a0 during which the plaintiff should be entitled to hold his position; and furthermore, because, in relieving the latter and appointing another person in his place, the defendant acted in accordance with the renunciation and resignation\u00a0 which the plaintiff had tendered.\u00a0 If the plaintiff is entitled to any indemnity in accordance with law, such was awarded to him\u00a0 in the judgment of the lower court by granting him the right to collect salary for one month and some odd days.<br\/><br\/>As for the other features of the case, the record does not show that the plaintiff has any good reason or legal ground upon which to claim an indemnity for losses and damages in the sum of P100,000, for it was not proved that he suffered to that extent, and the judgment appealed from has awarded him the month's salary to which he is entitled.\u00a0 Therefore that judgment and the order of March 14 sustaining the demurrer to the second cause of action are both in accordance with the law.<br\/><br\/>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the said judgment and order are deemed to have been refuted, both judgment and order are hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

CORNELIO FLORES, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">The defendant and appellant in this case was found guilty in the court below of the crime of rape (<i>violacion<\/i>) as defined and\u00a0 penalized in article 438 of the Penal Code, and was sentenced to twelve years and one day of <i>reclusion temporal<\/i> together with the accessory penalties prescribed by law.\u00a0 The complaining witness, Teresa Albarda, a young married woman 18 years of age, charged that the accused came to her house about noon on February 6, 1913, during the absence of her husband, arid then and there violated her by means of force and threats.<br\/><br\/>The accused admitted that he visited the complaining witness on that occasion, but denied that he had raped her or made use of force, or violence, or threats of any kind against her.\u00a0 Upon a review of all the evidence we are well satisfied that if the accused did in fact have carnal communication with the woman on that occasion, which is not improbable, it was with her consent; and we are convinced that the evidence of record fails utterly to establish the charge that he committed the abominable crime with which he was charged and of which he was convicted.<br\/><br\/>The material part of the\u00a0 woman's testimony was as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. What happened?\u2014A.\u00a0 On that day the accused came up into my house and caught me by the hand and the neck and threw himself upon me in such a way that I couldn't move and committed a brutal act upon me.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What brutal act was that?\u00a0 Be a little more explicit.\u2014A.\u00a0 He had carnal communication with me.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Did any one come in there during or after that act?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. What is his name?\u2014A.\u00a0 Catalino, whose surname I don't know.\"<\/blockquote>The story told by the woman on the witness stand sets out only the barest outlines of the alleged assault, and falls far short of furnishing the detailed account of the commission of the crime charged by her which might reasonably be expected from a woman testifying as to an incident every detail of which must have been indelibly impressed upon her mind.\u00a0 Under cross-examination she admitted that she made no outcry of any kind, but explained that this was due to the fact that the assailant caught her by the throat with his hands in such a way that it was impossible for her to cry aloud; and upon being further pressed for an explanation of her failure to call for assistance, she said, apparently as an afterthought, that she was afraid to do so because he carried a bolo, and with it threatened her life.<br\/><br\/>It appears that in the preliminary examination held before the\u00a0 justice of the peace she stated that the accused entered the house through a window while she was asleep, and that she awakened to find the accused in the act of violating her.\u00a0 She said nothing whatever of all this at the trial in the Court of First Instance, although it would naturally be expected that if the accused had\u00a0 in fact entered the house while she was asleep and if the first warning she had of his intent was to find him in the act of violating her, she could hardly fail to have recalled those facts when testifying at the trial in the court below.\u00a0 She admitted under cross-examination that she had known the accused since childhood, and that he frequently visited at her house, stopping there on his way to and from his work; and in view of these admissions as to her acquaintance with the accused and his frequent visits at her house, we find it difficult to understand why the accused found it necessary to enter her house by the window instead of by the door, for it appears that his visit was made at or about midday; and if in fact he did enter by the window, we find it still more difficult to understand why the witness omitted all reference to that fact and to the fact that she was asleep when he began his assault upon her, when she testified in\u00a0 the Court of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>The only other material witness called by the prosecution was the man Catalino Agtienza, who found the accused together with the complaining witness at or about the time when the crime was alleged to have been committed.\u00a0 This man testified that he is the nearest neighbor to the complaining witness and that about noon on the day in question he went to her house and found her seated in the sala in front of the accused, who was holding her hands; that she was crying, and that the accused appeared to be upset and vexed about something.\u00a0 The material part of his testimony was as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"I found Teresa seated in the sala and Cornelio, the accused, holding her by the hands, and she was weeping.\u00a0 I asked Cornelio, 'Why\u00a0 have you done this?\u00a0 Don't you know that we are neighbors here and ought to treat one another as brothers?'\u00a0\u00a0 Then Cornelio said to me, 'Go away from here, we'll have a talk later..'\u00a0 He said this to me in a bullying tone, so I went away.\" <\/blockquote>The witness upon being asked why he had gone to the house of the complaining witness, replied:\u00a0 \"Because her husband had charged me to go and see her now and then, as we are neighbors.\"<br\/><br\/>Further on in his testimony we find the following:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q. Did you see the accused again that day?\u2014A. No, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. Wasn't the accused in your house after the thing happened?\u2014A. We saw each other at other times, but it was in my house.\u00a0 He came to my house and asked me to do him the favor of not divulging or saying anything about what I had seen in that house.<br\/><br\/>\"Q. How long a time elapsed after you saw Cornelio until he came to your house?\u2014A.\u00a0 A little over an hour.\" <\/blockquote>Under cross-examination this witness admitted that when he saw the couple the accused was properly clothed, and it is very evident from his testimony that he saw no indication whatever of a struggle or of anything which would justify the belief that the accused by force or threats of violence had just raped the woman.\u00a0 When asked if the accused\u00a0 was armed with a bolo he said that he did not see one, and certain it is that if the accused carried a bolo on that occasion the attention of this witness was not directed to it.\u00a0 Both this witness and the woman herself admitted that although he was her nearest neighbor and although under the theory of the prosecution the accused had just raped the woman before he came up to the house, she made no complaint to him as to the conduct of the accused and so far as the evidence shows did not even speak to him.\u00a0 This witness further admitted under cross-examination that he made no attempt to interfere with the couple or to call the neighbors to assist him in doing so, and it would appear that all he did was to report the circumstances under which he found the couple together to the husband upon his return from his work.<br\/><br\/>Manifestly the statements of this witness in no wise tend to corroborate the testimony of the complaining witness, except in so far as she states that the accused was in the house together with her at the time when the witness came there, and this the accused does not deny.\u00a0 On the contrary, his testimony strongly tends to put in doubt the charge of the woman that the accused had committed rape upon her, for in the absence of some satisfactory explanation of their conduct, it is impossible to believe that under all the circumstances the woman would have made no complaint or outcry when her nearest neighbor appeared upon the scene just after the commission of the alleged rape, or that he would have made no attempt to interfere or to call for help had there been anything in the appearance of the couple to cause him to suspect that a crime of violence had just been committed upon the woman.<br\/><br\/>We think that the explanation given by the witness for his visit to the house on that occasion offers the key to the whole situation.\u00a0 He said that he went there because the woman's husband had asked him to keep an eye upon her and to go over to the house every now and then to see her during his absence.\u00a0 These instructions, taken together with the woman's admissions as to the frequent visits to her house by the accused suggest the possibility that the husband was jealous of her and of, her relations with the accused; that the woman having been caught by her neighbor in a compromising position with the accused, sought to escape all blame by denying that the accused was there with her consent; and that in order to give verisimilitude to her claims of innocence she charged him with the crime set out in the information.<br\/><br\/>An attempt was made in the court below to corroborate the testimony of the complaining witness by the testimony of the clerk of the Court of First Instance as to an alleged confession made by the accused.\u00a0 The clerk was called to the witness stand and stated that while the accused was confined in the provincial jail he visited him for the purpose of securing the names of the witnesses he wished to have called for the defense, and that the accused then told him that he had no witnesses and that he was going to plead guilty.\u00a0 The details of the alleged confession are very meager, and it is manifest that except by way of categorical answers to the questions of the clerk the accused had very little to say.\u00a0 According to the clerk he was rather indifferent, and substantially admitted that the charge against him was true.\u00a0 The substance of the testimony of the clerk is to be found in the following questions and answers contained in his evidence:<br\/><blockquote>\"Q.\u00a0 So the accused admitted to you that he had lain with that woman?\u2014A.\u00a0 Yes, sir.<br\/><br\/>\"Q.\u00a0 But did he also tell you that he had employed force?\u2014A.\u00a0 No, sir.\"<\/blockquote>From this excerpt from the testimony it will be seen that the accused by no means admitted to the clerk that he had raped the woman, but only that he had lain with her.\u00a0 The meager statements attributed to the accused by the clerk cannot be accepted as a confession on his part that he was guilty of the crime set out in the information, that is to say, of having violated her with force and threats.\u00a0 As we said at the outset, while it is possible and not improbable that the accused cohabited with the woman unlawfully at the time and place set out in the information, we think that the weight of the evidence shows that if he did so it was with her consent, and an admission by him that he was guilty of having improper relations with her cannot be treated as an admission of his guilt of the crime of rape.<br\/><br\/>The evidence as to the guilt of the accused of the crime with which he was charged consists wholly and exclusively of the testimony of the\u00a0 complaining witness, and while we have frequently held that the uncorroborated testimony of the offended party in cases of this kind may be sufficient under certain\u00a0 circumstances to warrant a conviction, yet from the very nature of the charge and the ease with which it may be made and the difficulty which surrounds the accused in disproving it where the point at issue is as to whether the cohabitation was had with or without the use of force or threats, it is imperative that such testimony should be scrutinized with the greatest caution.\u00a0 In all such cases the conduct of the woman immediately following the alleged assault is of the utmost importance as tending to establish the truth or falsity of the charge.\u00a0 Indeed it may well be doubted whether a conviction of the offense of rape should ever be sustained upon the uncorroborated testimony of the woman unless the court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that her conduct at the time when the alleged rape was committed and immediately thereafter was such as might be reasonably expected from her under all the circumstances of the case.\u00a0 Blackstone (2 Chitty's Blackstone, p. 165) quotes with approval a learned English judge (1 Hoi. P. C, 635) as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is true that rape is a most detestable crime, and therefore ought severely and impartially to be punished with death; but it must be remembered that it is an accusation easy to be made, hard to be proved, but harder to be defended by the party accused, though innocent.\" <\/blockquote>Then after relating two very extraordinary cases of malicious prosecution for this crime that had happened within his own observation, the quotation concludes thus:<br\/><blockquote>\"I mention these instances, that we may be the more cautious upon trials of offenses of this nature, wherein the court and jury may with so much ease be imposed upon, without great care and vigilance; the heinousness of the offense many times transporting the judge\u00a0 and jury with so much indignation that they are overhastily carried on to the conviction of the person accused thereof, by the confident testimony of sometimes false and malicious witnesses.\" <\/blockquote>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. De Dios (8 Phil. Rep,, 279), we quoted with approval from two learned commentators on the Penal Code as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The crime of rape is not to be presumed; consent and not physical force is the common origin of acts between man and woman.\u00a0 Strong evidence and indications of great weight will alone support such a presumption.\"\u00a0 (Pacheco, vol. 3, p. 126, par. 4.)<br\/><br\/>\"Should the records disclose that some hesitation was shown by the woman or that she contributed in some way to the realization of the act, this will perhaps constitute an offense very different from that of rape.\"\u00a0 (Viada, vol. 3, p. 119.) <\/blockquote>The trial judge in this case, who saw and heard the witnesses testify, believed the testimony of the complaining witness, and we might, perhaps, hesitate to disturb his findings but for the fact' that his opinion clearly shows that he was not impressed with inherent inconsistency between the conduct of the complaining witness as testified to by herself and by her neighbor, and that of a woman who had just suffered the\u00a0 indignity\u00a0 of being violated with\u00a0 force and threats by a man whom she had known all her life; and for the further reason that the trial judge does not appear to have noted the fact that the alleged confession to the clerk of the court appears to have been a confession merely that the accused had lain with the complaining witness and was by no means a confession that he had done so with force and violence, which is\u00a0 the very gravamen and essence of the charge against him.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons herein set forth the judgment of the court below convicting and sentencing the defendant should be and is hereby reversed, with the costs of this instance <i>de oficio<\/i>, and the accused should be and is hereby acquitted of the crime with which he is charged and will be set at liberty forthwith.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

PASCUAL, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"JUSTIFY\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Cagayan convicting the accused of the crime of embezzling public funds and sentencing him to three months' imprisonment, to suffer the disqualifications provided in section 3 of Act No. 1740, and to pay the costs.<br\/><br\/>The court also ordered the Government to return to the accused P112.21 standing to his credit in the office of the municipal treasurer of Gattaran.\u00a0 From\u00a0 this portion of the judgment no appeal is taken.<br\/><br\/>It appears that on the 18th day of March, 1912, the appellant in this case, at that time 22 years of age, was appointed municipal treasurer of Gattaran, Cagayan Province.\u00a0 This was the first public office which the appellant had ever held.\u00a0 He had had no business experience, no experience\u00a0 in the handling of public funds, in the keeping of books of account, in making out reports of public officers, and was, accordingly, ignorant of the duties and responsibilities of the office to which he was appointed.<br\/><br\/>On the 12th of July, 1912, that is to say, about four months after his appointment to office, he was visited by the auditor of that district, Mr. Guy Drake, who proceeded to make a partial examination of the accounts of the office and of the moneys on hand.\u00a0 The examination having reached a certain point, the district auditor found what he alleged to be a shortage of P159.85 in appellant's accounts.\u00a0 He thereupon asked the accused to produce funds sufficient to make it good.\u00a0 Alarmed and frightened the accused paid over the sum claimed to be short; so that, on the following day, the 13th of July, when the auditor sent his assistant, Lupo Guzman, to continue the examination, the alleged shortage had been made good, the accounts were found correct, and the books duly balanced.<br\/><br\/>The accused was immediately removed from office by his superiors, they acting upon the belief that he had embezzled the funds or that he was incompetent to manage the affairs of his office.\u00a0 Some time after his successor had been appointed there were found about the office in some unaccustomed place certain receipts showing that the appellant should not have been charged with a shortage of P159.85, but that if there was a shortage at all it was much less.\u00a0 One of these receipts was for P98.42 and the other P13.79, making a total of P112.21.\u00a0 These receipts had been issued to the appellant while he was in office for remittances made of public funds.\u00a0 They reduced the shortage, if any there was, to P47.64.\u00a0 Instead, however, of making a reexamination of the accounts of the accused, the district auditor began the criminal proceedings resulting in this appeal.<br\/><br\/>Upon these facts it is evident and undisputed that, the accused is entitled to recover from the Government the sum of P112.21, he having made up the alleged shortage of P159.85.<br\/><br\/>Prior to the examination by Mr. Guy Drake and just after the appointment of the accused, there had been an official visit made to this office by the traveling deputy provincial treasurer of Cagayan Province, named Pagalilauan, who also made an examination of the accounts of the accused.\u00a0 This examination was made during the latter part of the month of June.\u00a0 The accounts at that time were found correct, so far as the records show, and in pursuance of such examination the accused turned over at that time more than one thousand pesos in cash, the amount of the funds with which he was chargeable.\u00a0 Two or three days after this visit the accused became convinced that he had paid Pagalilauan P200 more than the amount named in the receipt which had been issued to him upon such payment.\u00a0 In this belief he wrote a letter to Pagalilauan stating that:\u00a0 \"That is a difference of P200, that is, instead of your taking the amount of P1,234.15 as <i>Transfer to Provincial Treasurer<\/i>, you took the amount of $1,435.15, thus leaving a difference of P200.\"\u00a0 The letter terminates with the request:\u00a0 \"Wherefore I hope you will give me details or send me said amount as the safe is short that much money, for the reason that you carried away P200 too much.\"\u00a0 There passed between the accused and Pagalilauan, as traveling deputy provincial treasurer, several letters, in one of which the latter said:\u00a0 \"*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 relative to that suspicion or imputation for that amount which you are short, in the\u00a0 midst of my poverty I can pay it up in order not to lose our positions, especially because we are young yet.\u00a0 Should there be a shortage in the settlement to be made by you and compadre Canapi, pay into the safe that amount of P200 as I will go down there on the 23d, and if my verification turns out to be the same, then I will have no objection to pay you, compadre, even if for no other reason than because of your suspicion of me, this being the first time that such a small treasury as that has charged me with taking the amount of P200, although I might steal as much as P50,000.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 Compadre, pay up the amount should there be a shortage, and I will pay you when I go down there,\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *.\"<br\/><br\/>We are satisfied from the whole case that the appellant in all that he did was acting in good faith and that the shortage, if any, was due to his youth and inexperience and incompetency to handle the business of his office, and not to the embezzlement of the funds of his office.\u00a0 The fact that the shortage was claimed to be at one time P159.85 and that the accused, without hesitation, made it up, when, as a matter of fact, he was not owing anything like that amount, if anything at all, is an indication not only of his incompetency as a public official but speaks strongly with respect to his good faith; and the fact that Mr. Drake, after what he claimed was a thorough examination, declared the shortage to be P159.85, when, as a matter of fact, it was only P47.64, if anything, casts a doubt upon the correctness, of his examination and leaves us pondering whether or not the P47.64 was not also a mistake.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, touching the good faith of the accused, it appears undisputed that he claimed that the traveling deputy provincial treasurer of Cagayan Province, Pagalilauan, had taken P200 more than he gave receipts\u00a0 for and that accordingly he was entitled to have his office reimbursed that amount.\u00a0 If that contention were true, or he honestly believed it to be true, he had another ground upon which to base his contention of good faith.\u00a0 Moreover, we have held that an immediate payment by the accused of the sum alleged to be short, where that shortage is small and might easily be the result of a mistake or of an honest difference of opinion between the examiner and the accused, would have considerable weight in establishing the lack of criminal intent.\u00a0 This court in the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Feliciano (15 Phil. Rep., 144) had the following facts before it:<br\/><blockquote>\"A deputy auditor testified that on the 20th of May, 1908, he went to the municipality of San Pedro Macati for the purpose of making an inspection of the office, cash, and accounts of the municipal treasury of said town, of which Mariano Feliciano was the treasurer; that there resulted from the examination a shortage of P53.05 in the cash of the municipal treasury; that at the moment when the difference was discovered he notified the treasurer of it, and the latter took the sum of P53.05 from his pocket and paid it, but he did not remember, however, whether he had questioned the treasurer as to why the amount was not in the safe; and that, at the time when the examination was made, there were other persons present, to wit, the municipal president and the municipal secretary.\" <\/blockquote>In deciding the case the court said: \"If, according to the officer who made\u00a0 the examination of the acounts, at the very moment when the shortage of P53 was discovered and the treasurer was notified he at once presented the money, no <i>prima facie<\/i> evidence of the crime of misappropriation can be established, nor any proof whatever that there was such misappropriation.\"<br\/><br\/>While in the case just cited the accused produced the money from his own pocket and made good the alleged shortage, in the case at bar it is alleged that the accused went out and borrowed the money which went to make up the shortage.\u00a0 It should be noted, however, that it does not appear that, if the shortage found had been the correct shortage, namely, P47.64, the accused would not have had that sum in his pocket or in the office.\u00a0 There having been demanded of him a sum, as a shortage, nearly four times as large as that which he actually owed, no conclusions prejudicial to him can\u00a0 be drawn from the fact of his borrowing the money to meet it.<br\/><br\/>In the case of United States <i>vs<\/i>. Catolico (18 Phil. Rep., 504), after quoting that portion of Act\u00a0 No. 1740\u00a0 which provides that the absence of the funds \"shall be deemed to be prima facie evidence that such missing funds or property have been put to personal uses,\" the court said:\u00a0 \"Nevertheless, that presumption is a rebuttable one and constitutes only a prime facie case against the person accused.\u00a0 If he present evidence showing that, in fact, he has not put said funds or property to personal uses, then that presumption is at an end and the prima facie case destroyed.\"<br\/><br\/>We are satisfied that the record demonstrates the good faith of the appellant and the entire lack of criminal intent to embezzle.\u00a0 The judgment of conviction is reversed and the accused acquitted.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

that said land was agricultural land; and that, by reason of these\u00a0 facts, the case fell within the provisions of subdivision 6 of section 54 of Act No. 926.\u00a0 From this decision\u00a0 the Director of Lands took an appeal, which was subsequently withdrawn.\u00a0 None of the other respondents appealed.<br\/><br\/>On the 8th of July, 1912, the court, without notice to the appellant, made and entered what it termed \"an additional decision,\" finding and holding that that portion of the land in question designated as parcel B was acquired by its original possessor under circumstances requiring payment therefor to the Government under the provisions of article 14 of the royal decree of January 26, 1889, and section 65 of Act 926 already referred to, and declaring that, as a condition precedent to the registration, the petitioner must pay P5 per hectare.<br\/><br\/>The original possessor of the greater part of the land in question was one Dimas Enriquez, who acquired part of it in the year 1889 and other parts in 1890 and 1891.\u00a0 The tract in question, parcel B, was acquired by occupation in 1891, it being at that time Government land.\u00a0 Enriquez sold the land to one Fitzgerald, who subsequently sold it to a Doctor Martin, who, in turn, conveyed it to the appellant.\u00a0 These persons possessed and cultivated the land continuously, peacefully, openly, and notoriously for more than twenty years prior to the filing of the petition for registration.<br\/><br\/>The Government relies upon section 65 of Act No. 926 to sustain\u00a0 the amended judgment of the\u00a0 Court of Land Registration requiring the payment of P5 per hectare as a condition precedent to the registration of the title to the land.\u00a0 The appellant, on the other hand, relies upon the provisions of paragraph 6 of section 54 of the same Act.<br\/><br\/>We are of the opinion that section 65 is not applicable to this case as it is made up by the evidence before us.\u00a0 That section applies to a case where, under the Spanish regime, a proceeding was begun in accordance with the law then in force to obtain title to lands for which applicant must, before obtaining title, pay a sum specified by law.\u00a0 To bring the case necessarily within section 65, not only must such proceeding have been brought, but it must further appear that the proceeding thus begun, and the facts upon which it was based, constitute the only title or claim which petitioner has to the land sought to be registered under the section.\u00a0 Where, as in the case at bar, the petitioner for registration under Act No. 926 has a title or rights apart from and independent of the proceedings to obtain title above referred to, he may elect whether he will base his rights on the proceeding begun under the Spanish law, as provided in section 65, or whether he will abandon his rights under that proceeding and stand upon a title or rights which he has acquired in some other manner and which bring him within some other provision of the Act.\u00a0 In the case before us the petitioner comes within the provisions of Act No. 926 independently of the proceeding to obtain title begun\u00a0 under the Spanish regime.\u00a0 He comes within that Act by virtue of possession and cultivation of agricultural land for the required time, and not by virtue of any proceeding which he may have begun prior to the American occupation.\u00a0 While, possibly, he could have elected to stand upon the proceeding begun under the Spanish regime to obtain title to the land in question and thereby have brought himself under the provisions of section 65, he did not do so, but, on the contrary, elected to abandon the rights which he had obtained under that proceeding\u00a0 and to stand upon possession and\u00a0 cultivation.\u00a0 By so doing, he brought himself within paragraph 6 of section 54 of said Act No. 926.\u00a0 He had a perfect right to do this, and having done it, he obtained his registration\u00a0 not by virtue of section 65, but by virtue of paragraph 6 of section 54.\u00a0 That being the case, he was entitled to have his title registered without the payment of the P5 per hectare which the court imposed upon him.<br\/><br\/>The judgment of the Land Court is modified by striking out the provision for the payment of P5 per hectare, and, as so modified, is affirmed, without costs in this instance.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

Sellner, a real estate agent, testified that he was familiar with real estate values in the city of Manila.\u00a0 He stated that the land in question, fronting as it did on Calles Herran and Looban and the Paco Estero, was worth 60 percent more than other land near by, and placed its value at P10 per square meter.\u00a0 He stated that he had carried on negotiations with regard to a parcel of land situated on the opposite side of the estero and fronting\u00a0 Herran; that he was offering this land for sale at P5.50 per square meter, but that the owner succeeded in obtaining P6 per square meter, and that the sale had been consummated only about thirty days prior to the date of the hearing.\u00a0 The witness stated that this land was of about the same elevation as the parcel sought to be expropriated, but that it had no improvements, being used for the\u00a0 storage of coal.<br\/><br\/>Enrique Brias, another real estate man, testified that was a good price for the land.\u00a0 He stated that he was the owner of the land on the opposite side of the estero which had been sold for P6 per square meter about one month prior to the hearing, but that this land was not in such a good commercial location.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Powell, of the Internal Revenue Bureau, testified that the\u00a0 Estrada land was appraised for taxation at P6 per square meter; that prior to 1911 it had been appraised at about P4 per square meter.<br\/><br\/>The president of the Municipal Board of the city of Manila testified that a parcel of land on the opposite side of Calle Herran but on the same side of the Paco Estero, owned by one Clarke, had been expropriated by the city in 1908.\u00a0 He stated that commissioners were appointed who duly rendered their report to the court, but as it was accepted by both parties, no further litigation was necessary.\u00a0 In this case it seems that the land desired by the city was part of a parcel fronting on Calle Herran, whose other boundaries were the Paco Estero, some private property, and a small callejon.\u00a0 The portion desired by the city comprised the entire Herran frontage of the owner.\u00a0 The commissioners appraised the total area, consisting of 1,399.03 square meters at P6.50 per square meter.\u00a0 The city desired only 353.21 square meters facing on Calle Herran, and the commissioners therefore found\u00a0 consequential damages to the remainder, due to depriving it of its Herran frontage, to be P4.50 per square meter.\u00a0 These consequential damages were included in the price paid by the city for\u00a0 the land taken, making the apparent price of the 353.21 square meters P7,002.05, or P19.85 per square meter.<br\/><br\/>To the same effect was the testimony of Judge Camus of the municipal court, who at the time of the Clarke transaction was city attorney.<br\/><br\/>Ariston Estrada, one of the defendants, testified as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"As to the market value of the land (the subject of the present case), whatever may be its price on the market, in my opinion, by comparing previous sales of land in the same or similar conditions and circumstances, and having in mind the only sale which has been made in twenty years of land equally or similarly situated to this, I believe that it is all that can serve as a standard to ascertain the value in the market of the land in question.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"With reference to the land, I believe I am as well informed as the witnesses for the plaintiff who have testified, and I estimate that the land in question should be worth on the market at this time P25 per square meter for the reason that about P19.85 per square meter was paid for Mr. Clarke's land and this was three years ago; and, on the one hand, property values have increased in the last three years, and, on the other hand, with the opening of the market, property values along Calles Herran and Looban have increased.\"<\/blockquote>From the record it appears that the improvements on the land consisted of a <i>camarin<\/i> in fairly good condition, appraised at P4,500; a dwelling house in very bad condition, appraised at Pl,500; the former being occupied by tenants and the latter by the defendant Estrada and his family.\u00a0 The remaining improvements consisted of a stone wall surrounding the lot, appraised at Pl,020, and some trees, appraised at P150.<br\/><br\/>The majority report of the committee, fixing the value of the land at P20 per square meter, states:<br\/><blockquote>\"And lastly, with respect to the value of the land, the evidence is very contradictory.\u00a0 While the evidence of the plaintiff tends to show that the value of the land does not exceed P10 per square meter, that of the defendants, on the contrary, maintains that the value of the land is more than P19.85 per square meter, and it is contended by the defendants that the true market value of the land in question is P25 per square meter.\"<\/blockquote>The lower court, in arriving at its decision to reduce the price of the land to P15, discussed the Clarke transaction at some length, and concluded as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The court therefore understands that the price which the plaintiff accepted three years ago for a piece of land less suited for commercial purposes than that in question, without proof that since then the price of land in the place where the tract here considered is situated has fallen, ought to serve as a criterion for fixing the value of the land that is the subject matter of the present expropriation.<br\/><br\/><div style=\"text-align: center;\">*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *<br\/><\/div><br\/>\"So, the court holds it just and equitable to take as a compromise between the two conflicting majority and minority opinions of the three commissioners the average of the two prices they have fixed\u00a0 per square meter for the land in question, P20 and P10, respectively, fixing upon P15 per square meter.\"<\/blockquote>From this review of the evidence it appears that two disinterested witnesses for the plaintiff corporation testified that the land was worth P10 per square meter, their statements being based upon the prices obtained for land in the open market in the vicinity.\u00a0 The defendant Estrada testified that it was worth P25 per square meter, basing his statement on the price obtained three years previously by the owner of the parcel on the opposite side of Calle Herran of P19.85 per square meter.\u00a0 It also clearly\u00a0 appears that the price fixed in the majority report of the commissioners was based principally upon this same transaction, and that the compromise price fixed by the court was based upon the evidence of this sale and the testimony of the two witnesses for the plaintiff who fixed the price at P10 per square meter.<br\/><br\/>Attorney for the plaintiff corporation objected to the introduction of all evidence with reference to the Clarke transaction, and so much depending upon it, it is proper to inquire as to its competency and relevancy.<br\/><br\/>The general rule that the\u00a0 market value of the land taken is the just compensation to which the owner of condemned property is entitled under the law meets with our unqualified approval.\u00a0 Such was our holding in Manila R. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Fabie (17 Phil. Rep., 206).\u00a0 But as stated in Packard <i>vs<\/i>. Bergen Neck Ry. Co. (54 N. J. L., 553; 25 A.,\u00a0 506) :<br\/><blockquote>\"The difficulty is not with the rule, but with its application.\u00a0 For the determination of the market value of land, which is that sum of money which a person, desirous but not compelled to buy and an owner willing but not compelled to sell, would agree on as a price to be given and received therefore, is beyond doubt difficult.\u00a0 The test is logically and legally correct, but it cannot be applied to land with the accuracy with which it can be applied to stocks, bonds, and personal property generally.\u00a0 Still, it is this test which admittedly must be applied, even when the value of the land and the damages are found in separate sums.\"<\/blockquote>It is a very difficult matter to limit the scope of the inquiry as to what the market value of condemned property is.\u00a0 The market value of a piece of land is attained by a consideration of all those facts which make it commercially valuable.\u00a0 Whether evidence considered by those whose duty it is to appraise the land is of that nature is often a very difficult matter to decide.\u00a0 The Supreme Court of the United States, in a carefully worded statement, marks out the scope of the inquiry as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"In determining the value of land appropriated for public purposes, the same considerations are to be regarded as in a sale of property between private parties.\u00a0 The inquiry in such cases must be what is the property worth in the market, viewed not merely with reference to the uses to which it is at the time applied, but with reference to the uses to which it is plainly adapted; that is to say, what is it worth from its availability for\u00a0 valuable uses?\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 As a general thing, we should say that the compensation to the owner is to be estimated by reference to the uses for which the property is\u00a0 suitable, having regard to the existing business of wants of the community, or such as may be reasonably expected in the immediate future.\"\u00a0 (98 U. S., 403; 25 L. ed., 206.)<\/blockquote>This passage is quoted with approval in the late case of St. Louis\u00a0 I. M. &amp; S. R. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Theodore Maxfield Co. (94 Ark., 135; 26 L. R. A. (N. S.), 1111; 126 S. W., 83)-a very well considered case.<br\/><br\/>The supreme court of Missouri has also formulated an exceedingly clear statement of the matter in the Stock Yards case (120 Mo., 541) :<br\/><blockquote>\"The market value of the property means its actual value, independent of the location of plaintiff's road thereon, that is, the fair value of the property as between one who wants to purchase and one who wants to sell it; not what could be obtained for it in peculiar circumstances when greater than its fair price could be obtained; not its speculative value; not the value\u00a0 obtained through the necessities of another.\u00a0 Nor, on the other hand, is it to be limited to that price which the property would bring when forced off at auction under the hammer.\u00a0 The question is, if the defendant wanted to sell its property, what could be obtained for it upon the market from parties who wanted to buy and would give its full value.\"\u00a0 (Approved in Met. Street Ry. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Walsh,\u00a0 197 Mo., 392, 418; 94 S. W., 860.)<\/blockquote>These views are practically in accord with Lewis on Eminent Domain (2d ed.), paragraph 478, who states the rule as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The market value of property is the price which it will bring when it is offered for sale by one who desires, but is not obliged to sell it, and is bought by one who is under no necessity of having it.\u00a0 In estimating its value all the capabilities of the property, and all the uses to which it may be applied or for which it is adapted, are to be considered, and not merely the condition it is in at the time and the use to which it is then applied by the owner.\u00a0 It is not a question of the value of the property to the owner.\u00a0 Nor can the damages be enhanced by his unwillingness to sell.\u00a0 On the other hand, the damages cannot be measured by the value of the property to the party condemning it, nor by its need of the\u00a0 particular property.\u00a0 All the facts as to the condition of the property and its surroundings, its improvements and capabilities, may be shown and considered in estimating its value.\"\u00a0 (Approved in Seaboard Air Line <i>vs<\/i>. Chamblin, 108 Va., 42.)<\/blockquote>In the practical application of this doctrine, the courts have been obliged to reject various kinds of evidence which the partisan zeal of the one side has attempted to introduce in order to swell the measure of damages, and to approve evidence which the other side has attempted to discredit in order to reduce the amount to be realized.\u00a0 Three such questions present themselves in this case.<br\/><br\/>First, testimony as to mere offers for the property desired or for\u00a0 contiguous property is not admissible.\u00a0 Upon this point we quote from the case of Keller <i>vs<\/i>. Paine (34 Hun, 167):<br\/><blockquote>\"Its value depends upon too many circumstances.\u00a0 If evidence of offers is to be received it will be important to know whether the offer was made in good faith, by a man of good judgment, acquainted with the value of the article and of sufficient ability to pay; also whether the offer was cash, for credit, in exchange, and whether made with reference to the market value of the article; or to supply a\u00a0 particular need or to gratify a fancy.\u00a0 Private offers can be multiplied to any extent for the purposes of a cause, and the bad faith in which they were made would\u00a0 be difficult to prove.\u00a0 The reception of evidence of private offers to sell or purchase stands upon an entirely different footing from evidence of actual sales between individuals or by public auction, and also upon a different footing from bids made at auction sales.\u00a0 The reception of this class of evidence would multiply the issues upon questions of damages to an extent not to be tolerated by courts aiming to practically administer justice between litigants.\"\u00a0 (As\u00a0 quoted with approval in Yellowstone Park R. R. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Bridger Coal Co., 34\u00a0 Mont., 545.)<\/blockquote>In the present case, the defendant Estrada testified that upon learning that the property which was the subject of the present litigation was to be condemned, he offered to pay a real estate agent P15 per square meter for a piece of land situated in the locality with relatively similar commercial location.\u00a0 This was improper evidence and should not have been considered by the commissioners.\u00a0 (See also Sherlock <i>vs<\/i>. Chicago B. &amp; Q. R. Co., 130 111., 403; 22 N. E., 844; Winnisimmet Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Grueby, 111 Mass., 543; Montclair Ry. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Benson, 36 N. J. L., 557.)<br\/><br\/>The second point raised by the evidence taken in the present case is the admission of testimony relative to real estate transactions in the vicinity of the land desired.\u00a0 The rule which admits such evidence meets with universal approval, but with certain reservations.<br\/><br\/>In Aledo Terminal Ry. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Butler (246 111., 406; 92 N. E., 909) the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Evidence of voluntary sales of other lands in the vicinity and similarly situated is admissible in evidence to aid in estimating the value of the tract sought to be condemned, but the value of such testimony depends upon the similarity of the land to that in question and the time when such sales were made and the distance such lands are from those the value of which is the subject of inquiry.\"<\/blockquote>The supreme court of Massachusetts, in Fourth National Bank <i>vs<\/i>. Com, (212 Mass., 66; 98 N. E., 86), affirms the rule as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"It long has been settled, that in the assessment of damages where lands are acquired by eminent domain evidence is admissible of the price received from sales of land similar in character, and situated in the vicinity, if the transactions are not so remote in point of time that a fair comparison practically is impossible.\"<\/blockquote>In Hewitt <i>vs<\/i>. Price (204 Mo., 31) it was said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It is sufficient to say\u00a0 upon this proposition that the law is well settled in this State upon that subject, and while the value or selling price of similar property may be taken into consideration in determining the value of the piece of property in litigation, it is equally true that the location and character of\u00a0 such property should be similar and the sales of such other property should at least be reasonably near in point of time to the time at which the inquiry of the value of the property in dispute is directed.\"<\/blockquote>In Laing <i>vs<\/i>. United New Jersey R. R. &amp; C. Co. (54 N. J. L., 576; 33 Am. St. Rep., 682; 25 A., 409) it was said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Generally in this and other States evidence of sales of land in the neighborhood is competent on an inquiry as to the value of land, and\u00a0 if the purchases or sales were made by the party against whom the evidence was offered it might stand as an admission.\u00a0 But such testimony is received only upon the idea that there is substantial similarity between the properties.\u00a0 The practice does not extend, and the rule should not be applied, to cases where the conditions are so dissimilar as not easily to admit of reasonable comparison, and much must be left to the discretion of the trial judge in the determination of the preliminary question whether the conditions are fairly comparable.\"<\/blockquote>In an earlier case, and which will be referred to again upon another question, the supreme court of Illinois stated the rule as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"The theory upon which evidence of sales of other similar property in the neighborhood, at about the same time, is held to be admissible is that it tends to show the fair market value of the property sought to be condemned.\u00a0 And it cannot be doubted that such sales, when made in a free and open market, where a fair opportunity for competition has existed, become material and often very important factors in determining the value of the particular property in question.\"\u00a0 (Peoria Gas Light Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Peoria Term. Ry. Co., 146 III., 372; 21 L. R. A., 373; 34 N. E., 550.)<\/blockquote>Even in those States where direct evidence of particular sales is not allowed, such questions may be directed to witnesses on cross-examination to test their credibility.\u00a0 This is the position taken by the supreme court of Pennsylvania in the late cases of Rea <i>vs<\/i>. Pittsburg, etc., R. R. Co. (229 Pa., 106) and Brown <i>vs<\/i>. City of Scranton (231 Pa., 593; 80\u00a0 A., 1113),\u00a0 See also Oregon R. &amp; N. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Eastlack (54 Ore., 196; 102 Pac, 1011) where this somewhat technical difference is set forth.<br\/><br\/>Evidence of other sales is competent if the character of such parcels as sites for business purposes, dwellings, or for whatever other use which enhances the pecuniary value of the condemned land is sufficiently similar to the latter that it may be reasonably assumed that the price of the condemned land would be approximately near the price brought by the parcels sold.\u00a0 The value of such evidence, of course, diminishes as the differences between the property sold and the condemned land increase.\u00a0 The property must be in the immediate neighborhood, that is, in the zone of commercial activity with which the condemned property is identified, and the sales must be sufficiently coeval with the date of the condemnation proceedings as to exclude general increases or decreases in property values due to changed Commercial conditions in the vicinity.\u00a0 No two estates are ever exactly alike, and as the differences between parcels sold and the land condemned must necessarily be taken into consideration in comparing values, we think it much better that those differences should be shown as part of the evidence of such sales, as is the practice in Iowa.\u00a0 (Town of Cherokee <i>vs<\/i>. S. C. &amp; I. F. Town Lot and Land Co., 52 Iowa, 279, 3 N. W., 42.)\u00a0 And where these differences are so great that the sales in question can form no reliable standard for comparison, such evidence should not be admitted.\u00a0 (Presbrey <i>vs<\/i>. Old Colony &amp; Newport R. Co., 103 Mass., 1.)<br\/><br\/>The testimony as to the sale of a parcel of land on the opposite side of the estero from the condemned land at P6 per square meter we think was properly admitted, and should have been given much greater weight by the commissioners and the court below.\u00a0 This was a sale in the open market, just one month prior to the time of the hearing before the commissioners.\u00a0 It was located on the same street, Calle Herran, and on the same estero.\u00a0 The difference between the two parcels as to location was that the condemned property also had a frontage on Calle Looban and was on the same side of the estero and immediately in front of the market site.\u00a0 It is true that the condemned land had improvements upon it while the parcel sold was vacant land.\u00a0 But it is also true that the values of these improvements were estimated as separate and distinct items, and the value of the land was estimated without regard to the improvements upon it.\u00a0 A sale of vacant land is evidence of the value of neighboring land.\u00a0 (O'Malley <i>vs<\/i>. Com., 182 Mass., 196; 65\u00a0 N. E., 30.)\u00a0 Basing their estimate of the value of the condemned land upon the price obtained for\u00a0 the parcel mentioned, and estimating the more favored location of the condemned land as being worth 60 per cent more than the land on the opposite side of the estero, Sellner and\u00a0 Brias arrived at the conclusion that P10 per square meter (a difference of more than 66 per cent) was a fair price for the land condemned.\u00a0 These witnesses were professional real estate agents, both had been active in the vicinity at about the time they testified before the commissioners, and were therefore peculiarly qualified to appraise the land in question.\u00a0 We are inclined to agree with the opinion expressed in the case of 1.1. &amp; M. R. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Humiston (208 111., 100; 69 N. E., 880), where it is said:<br\/><blockquote>\"The fact of sales is not always the only factor in determining the weight of the testimony of a witness as to value.\u00a0 A witness may, in forming his opinion, consider the uses and capabilities of the property, as well as the prices at which like property in the neighborhood has been sold.\u00a0 He may also base his opinion of value upon his knowledge or observation of the growth and development of towns and cities, a general knowledge of trade and business, rental value, the interest which the land would pay upon an investment, its productiveness, ease of cultivation, its situation in a particular community, and other elements.\"<\/blockquote>These parcels were in the same neighborhood and their respective locations and surroundings were, with the differences above named, practically the same.\u00a0 The price which the parcel sold by Brias brought was therefore of great importance as a basis for estimating\u00a0 the value of the condemned land.<br\/><br\/>The next question of\u00a0 evidence, and the most important to this case, is the admissibility of evidence showing prices paid for neighboring land\u00a0 under eminent domain proceedings.\u00a0 Is this class of evidence admissible?\u00a0 The authorities almost with one accord reply emphatically, No.\u00a0 The rule is so universal that it seems sufficient to quote from only one or two authorities.\u00a0 Lewis on Eminent Domain (par. 447) says:<br\/><blockquote>\"What the party condemning has paid for other property is incompetent.\u00a0 Such sales are not a fair criterion of value, for the reason that they are in the nature of a compromise.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The fear of one party or the other to take the risk of legal proceedings ordinarily results in the one party paying more or the other party taking less than is considered to be the fair market value of the property.\u00a0 For these reasons, such sales would not seem to be competent evidence of value in any case, whether in a proceeding by the same condemning party or otherwise.\"<\/blockquote>In the case of Peoria Gas Light Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Peoria Term. Ry. Co.\u00a0 (146\u00a0 111., 372), from which we quoted above sustaining the rule that sales of property in the vicinity are admissible as evidence, it was said:<br\/><blockquote>\"But it seems very clear that to have that tendency, they (sales of adjacent land) must have been made under circumstances where they are not compulsory, and where the vendor is not compelled to sell at all events, but is at liberty to invite competition among those desiring to become purchasers.\u00a0 Accordingly among the various decisions in this and other States to which our attention has been called or which our own researches have discovered, we find none in which the price paid at a forced or compulsory sale has been admitted as competent evidence of value.\"<\/blockquote>This case is particularly valuable for its review of the authorities upon this point.\u00a0 Other late cases sustaining the rule are: U.

W., 605).<br\/><br\/>It is to be observed\u00a0 that this rule excluding evidence of prices obtained for neighboring land under eminent domain proceedings is in the nature of an exception to the rule that sales of such land may be offered in evidence, and that, speaking briefly, the underlying reason is that they are not prices obtained \"by one who desires but is not obliged to sell it, and is bought by one who is under no necessity for having it.\"<br\/><br\/>The objection oi the plaintiff to the introduction of evidence showing what Clarke had obtained for his land condemned by the city in 1908 was well taken.\u00a0 The testimony of Estrada, based, as he himself admits (see excerpt of his testimony above), upon that transaction, was valueless, and the commissioners and the lower court erred in using it as a basis for estimating the value of the condemned land.<br\/><br\/>But, carrying this discussion perhaps one step further than is really necessary, we desire to say that even were evidence of the Clarke transaction admissible in the present case, the use made of the facts of that case by the witness Estrada, the commissioners, and the court itself, was clearly erroneous.\u00a0 As was stated above, the apparent\u00a0 price of P19.85 for the land taken by the city was in\u00a0 reality made up of P6.50 per square meter for the land itself and consequential damages to the remaining portion of Clarke's land at the rate of P4.50 per square meter.<br\/><blockquote>\"The damage or injury to the remainder of the land on account of the construction of the railroad is in effect the actual taking of that much of the remainder of the land, for the diminished market value of which the owner is entitled to full compensation.\"\u00a0 (St. Louis I.

Howe (49 Colo., 256; 112 P., 779):<br\/><blockquote>\"The jury viewed the premises and were better able to judge of the number of acres in each, as well as other conditions affecting the\u00a0 land.\u00a0 The facts ascertained by the view of the premises are not in the record, whether they were regarded as so much additional evidence, or were used to better understand and apply the evidence adduced at the trial.\u00a0 Keeping in view the evidence relating to the special value of the building site, the value of improvements and of the ground, it will be found that the verdict is within and supported by the values as testified to, and these\u00a0 values, as fixed by the several witnesses, represented to each the market value, as conceded by appellants.\u00a0 The verdict is supported by the evidence of market value and on that ground would have to be sustained if the matter complained of in the instruction had been entirely omitted.\"<\/blockquote>In a\u00a0 clear statement of the rule, the supreme court of Pennsylvania says (Gorgas <i>vs<\/i>. Railroad Co., 144 Pa., 1; 22 A., 715):\u00a0 \"A view may sometimes be of the highest importance, where there is a conflict of testimony.\u00a0 It may enable the jurors to see on which side the truth lies.\u00a0 And if the witnesses on the\u00a0 one side or the other have testified to a state of facts which exists only in their imagination, as to the location of the property, the manner in which it is cut by the road, the character of the improvements, or any other physical fact bearing upon the case, they surely cannot be expected to ignore the evidence of their\u00a0 senses, and give weight to testimony which their view shows to be false.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The true rule, in such cases, is believed to be that the jury in estimating the damages shall consider the testimony as given by the witnesses, in connection with the facts as they appear upon the view; and upon the whole case, as thus presented, ascertain the difference between the market value of the property immediately before and immediately after the land was taken.\u00a0 This difference is the proper measure of the damages.\"<br\/><br\/>In Close <i>vs<\/i>. Samm (27\u00a0 Iowa, 503) it\u00a0 was said:\u00a0 \"The question then arises as to the purpose and intent of this statute.\u00a0 It seems to us that it was to enable the jury, by the view of the premises or place, to better understand and comprehend the testimony of the witnesses respecting the same, and thereby the more intelligently to apply the testimony to the issues on trial before them, and not to make them silent witnesses in the case, burdened with testimony unknown to both parties, and in respect to which no opportunity for cross-examination or correction of error, if any, could be\u00a0 afforded either party.\u00a0 If they are thus permitted to include their personal examination, how could a court ever properly set aside their verdict as being against the evidence, or even refuse to set it aside without knowing the facts\u00a0 ascertained by such personal examination by the jury?\u00a0 It is a general rule, certainly, if not universal, that the jury must base their verdict upon the evidence delivered to them in open court, and they may not take into consideration facts known to them personally, but outside of the evidence produced before them in court.\u00a0 If a party would avail himself of the facts known to a juror, he must have him sworn and examined as other witnesses.\"\u00a0 (Approved in the late case of Guinn <i>vs<\/i>. Railway Co., 131 Iowa, 680; 109 N. W., 209.)<br\/><br\/>The doctrine finds favor in Kansas.\u00a0 In\u00a0 C. K. &amp; W. R. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Mouriquand (45 Kan., 170), the court approved of the practice of instructing the jury that their view of the premises was to be used in determining the value of conflicting testimony, saying:\u00a0 \"Had the jury disregarded all the sworn evidence, and returned a verdict upon their own view of the premises,\u00a0 then it might be said that the evidence which the jurors acquired from making the view had been elevated to the character of exclusive and predominating evidence.\u00a0 This is not allowable.\u00a0 The evidence of the witnesses introduced in the court on\u00a0 the part of the landowner supports fully the verdict.\u00a0 If the verdict was not supported by substantial testimony given by witnesses sworn upon the trial, we would set it aside, but as the jury only took into consideration the result of their view of the premises, in connection with the sworn evidence produced before them, to determine between conflicting evidence, the instruction was not so erroneous as to require a new trial.\"<br\/><br\/>A very clear statement of it is made by Dyer, J., charging a jury, in Laflin <i>vs<\/i>. Chicago W. &amp; N. R. Co. (33 Fed. Rep., 415): \"You have been permitted to view the premises in question.\u00a0 The object of this view was to acquaint you with the physical situation, condition, and surroundings of the premises, and to enable you better to understand the evidence on the trial.\u00a0 The knowledge which you acquired by the view may be used by you in determining the weight of conflicting testimony respecting value and damage, but no farther.\u00a0 Your final conclusion must rest on the evidence here adduced.\"<br\/><br\/>In Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Peyton (124 Ga., 746; 52 S. E., 803; 3 L. R. A. (N. S.), 333) it was said: \"A jury cannot be left to roam without any evidence in the ascertainment and assessment of damages.\u00a0 The damages which the law allows to be assessed in favor of landowners whose property has been taken or damaged under the right of eminent domain are purely compensatory.\u00a0\u00a0 The land actually appropriated by the telegraph company amounted to only a fraction of an acre; and while it appeared that the construction and maintenance of the telegraph line would cause consequential damages to the plaintiff, no proof was offered from which any fair and reasonable estimate of the amount of damages thereby sustained could be made.\u00a0 The jury should have been supplied with the data necessary in arriving at such an estimate.\u00a0 In the absence of this essential proof, a verdict many times in excess of the highest proved value of the land actually taken must necessarily be deemed excessive.\"<br\/><br\/>The question has often been up in the State of Illinois, and the rule has been clearly stated there in a number of cases.\u00a0 In Sexton <i>vs<\/i>. Union Stock Yard Co. (200 III, 244; 65 N. E., 638), a leading case, it was said: \"The evidence consisted most largely of opinions of values entertained by the different witnesses.\u00a0 Their judgment varied widely and their opinions were likewise variant.\u00a0 The amount allowed, though much less than the estimates of the witnesses produced in appellant's behalf, is larger than that of the witnesses produced by the appellee company.\u00a0 We cannot know the effect which was produced on the minds of the jurors by the actual inspection of the premises.\u00a0 The rule in such cases is not to disturb a verdict, if it is within the range of the testimony, unless we can clearly see that injustice has been done and that passion and prejudice influenced the action of the jury.\"<br\/><br\/>In the very recent case\u00a0 of South\u00a0 Park Comrs. <i>vs<\/i>. Ayer (245 111., 402; 92 N. E., 274) it was said:\u00a0 \"The jury view the premises, and the law is well settled in this State that in a condemnation proceeding, where the jury have viewed the premises and where the evidence is conflicting, and where the amount is within the range of value as testified to on the trial, and does not appear to have been the result of prejudice, passion, undue influence, or other improper cause, the verdict will not be disturbed.\u00a0 (Citing\u00a0 cases.)\u00a0 It is clear the amount fixed by the jury in this case was well within the range of the evidence, which was conflicting, and the verdict should not be set aside unless it appears it was brought about by some improper ruling of the court upon the trial.\"<br\/><br\/>The rule is also stated in Lanquist <i>vs<\/i>. City of Chicago (200 111., 69; 65 N. E., 681) ; in\u00a0 I. I. &amp; M. R. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Humiston (208 III, 100; 69 N. E,, 880); and in G. &amp; S. R. R. R. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Herman (206 111., 34; 69 N. E., 36).<br\/><br\/>In New York, where the question has doubtless been raised more often than anywhere else, the late cases illustrate the rule perhaps the most clearly.<br\/><br\/>The appellate division, supreme court, in <i>In re<\/i> Titus Street in City of New York (123 N. Y. S., 1018), where it appeared that the city's witnesses testified that the property was worth $9,531 and the commissioners awarded $2,000 less, said: \"We do not think this is meeting the requirements of the law; we do not believe that it is within the province of the commissioners to arbitrarily set up their own opinion against that of the witnesses called by the city, and to award damages largely below the figure at which the moving party is committed, without something appearing in the record to justify such action.\u00a0 When a party comes into court and makes an admission against his interest, no court or judicial tribunal is justified in assuming that the admission is not true, without at least pointing out the reason for discrediting it; it carries with it the presumption of truth, and this presumption is not to\u00a0 be overcome by the mere fact that the commissioners might themselves have reached a different conclusion upon the viewing\u00a0 of the premises.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 This view of the commissioners, it seems to us, is for the purpose of enabling the commissioners to give proper weight and effect to the evidence before them, and it might justify them in giving larger damages than some of the witnesses thought proper, or even less than some of them declared to be sustained.\u00a0 But where the evidence produced by the moving party in a proceeding for taking property for public purposes fixes a sum, without any disagreement in the testimony on that side, we are of the opinion that the cases do not justify a holding that the commissioners are authorized to ignore such testimony and to substitute their own opinion in such a manner as to preclude the supreme court from reviewing the determination.\u00a0 That is not in harmony with that due process of law which is always demanded where rights of property are involved, and would make it possible for a corrupt commission to entirely disregard the rights of the individual to the undisturbed enjoyment of his property or its equivalent.\"<br\/><br\/>From these authorities, and keeping in mind the local law on the subject, we think the correct rule to be that, if the testimony of value and damages is conflicting, the commissioners may resort to their knowledge of the elements which affect the assessment and which were obtained from a view of the premises, in order to determine the relative weight of conflicting testimony, but their award must be supported by the evidence adduced at their hearings and made of record or it cannot stand; or, in other words, the view is intended solely for the purpose of better understanding the evidence submitted.\u00a0 To allow the commissioners to make up their judgment on their own individual knowledge of disputed facts material to the case, or upon their private opinions, would be most dangerous and unjust.\u00a0 It would deprive the losing party of the right of cross-examination and the benefit of all the tests of credibility which the law affords.\u00a0 It would make each commissioner the absolute judge of the accuracy and value of his own knowledge or opinions and compel the court to affirm the report on the facts when all of such facts were not before it.\u00a0 The evidence of such knowledge or of the grounds of such opinions could not be preserved in a bill of exceptions or questioned upon appeal.<br\/><br\/>In those cases where the testimony as to value and damages is conflicting, the commissioners should always set forth in full their reasons for accepting the testimony of certain witnesses and rejecting that of others, especially in those cases where a view of the premises has been made.<br\/><br\/>The commissioners, being disinterested landowners of the province, selected by the court for their ability to arrive at a judicious decision in the assessment of damages, their report is entitled to greater weight than that of an ordinary trier of facts.\u00a0 A mere\u00a0 numerical superiority of the witnesses on the one side or the other should not be sufficient to overturn the decision arrived at by the commissioners, as such witnesses are not required to be either landowners or judicious and disinterested parties, as are the commissioners.\u00a0 The weight to be given to the testimony of a witness might be considerable or it might be almost negligible, according to his standing in the community and his ability and experience in real estate values.\u00a0 But where experts fixed the value of the property, the lowest estimate being $5,533 and the\u00a0 highest $16,000, and the commissioners allowed only $750, the court held that the award was inadequate.\u00a0 (<i>In re<\/i> Metropolitan EL Ry. Co., 27 N. Y. S., 756.)\u00a0 And where a lessee of a building was allowed damages in an extravagant sum for his unexpired lease, when compared with the allowance made to the owner of the property, the award was set aside.\u00a0 (<i>In re<\/i> Manhattan Loop No. 1, 135 N. Y. S., 153).\u00a0 In Palmer <i>vs<\/i>. Harris County (29 Tex. Civ. App., 340, 69 S. W., 229) the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"It may be that the jury were influenced by the idea that it might not have been necessary to use all of the tract sought to be condemned for the construction\u00a0 of the ditch, but the proceeding was to condemn the entire tract, and so far as presented by the record the value of the land might be so affected by the construction of the ditch as to destroy its use by the appellant for any purpose.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 The verdict is so manifestly against the great preponderance of the evidence that we deem it our duty to set it aside.\"<\/blockquote>Calor Oil &amp; Gas Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Withers (141 Ky., 489; 133 S. W., 210) was an action to condemn a strip of land 27 feet wide and 434\u00a0 feet long for a pipe line, the said strip lying wholly within a railroad right of way.\u00a0 The commissioners appointed to assess the damages fixed them at $16.51.\u00a0 Upon appeal, the damages were assessed at $750, which was held by the supreme court to be flagrantly excessive and was set aside.\u00a0 In Mutual Union Telegraph Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Katkamp (103 III., 420) it appeared that telegraph poles were to be set along the line of a railroad right of way, 1 foot from such right of way\u00a0 line, so that there would be eleven poles on defendant's land.\u00a0 The defendant himself testified that his land was worth $60 per acre, and that the damage done would be about $10 per pole.\u00a0 Two other witnesses testified that $10 per pole would be the amount of\u00a0 defendant's damage.\u00a0 Of three witnesses for the plaintiff, one testified that the damage would be 50 cents and two that it would be $1 per pole.\u00a0 As only a very small fraction of an acre of defendant's land would be taken, a verdict of $38.50 was held to be manifestly against the weight of evidence and the judgment was reversed.<br\/><br\/>The report of the commissioners has also been set aside because a wrong principle of assessing the damages was used.\u00a0 Thus, in Waterford E. Light, Heat &amp; Power Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Reed (94 N. Y. S., 551),the award was set aside because counsel for the plaintiff had represented to the commissioners that the plaintiff was only acquiring the right of flowage in respect to the property in question and that the defendants, by reason of the execution of a deed, had lost all but a nominal interest in the question of damages, both of which theories were untrue, and which resulted in only nominal damages being awarded to the defendants.\u00a0 In the\u00a0 matter of Gilroy (85 Hun, 424; 32 N. Y. S., 891) it appeared that the commissioners erroneously refused to take into consideration the fact that the property was available for use in connection with the water supply of the city of New York, in estimating the value of the property, and the report was for that reason set aside as allowing insufficient damages.\u00a0 No allowance having been made for consequential damages, the report of the commissioners was set aside.\u00a0 (Williamson <i>vs<\/i>. Read, 106 Va., 453; 56 S. E., 174.)\u00a0 And where a deed was so construed as embracing more land than it actually did embrace, resulting in excessive damages being awarded, the report was set aside.\u00a0 (Morris &amp; Essex R. Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Bonnell, 34 N. J\". L.,\u00a0 474.)\u00a0 The report has also been set aside for refusal to consider competent evidence.\u00a0 (State <i>vs<\/i>. Shuffield &amp; Thompsonville Bridge Co., 82 Conn., 460; 74 A., 775.)<br\/><br\/>We come now to a consideration of the amount fixed upon by this\u00a0 court of P10 per square meter for the condemned land.\u00a0 We have already referred to the testimony of the two real estate agents, Brias and Sellner, which was based upon a sale of similarly situated land made only thirty days previous to the date of the\u00a0 hearing; and the assessment of the property for taxation, at P6 per square meter.\u00a0 This was the evidence upon which the dissenting commissioner predicated his appraisement of the land, arriving at the same figure as did this Supreme Court of P10 per square meter. There is a considerable difference between this valuation and P25 per square meter, as fixed by Estrada, or of the price fixed by the majority report of the commissioners of P20 per square meter.\u00a0 It is to be noted that no witnesses other than Estrada were called who could confirm the higher valuation or even testify to an intermediate price.\u00a0 The price of P10 per square meter is 66 per cent greater than that obtained for land on the opposite side of the\u00a0 estero, and this difference would seem amply sufficient to compensate for the more favored location of the condemned land. That P10 per square meter is a just compensation is shown by a great preponderance of the evidence.<br\/><br\/>\"Compensation\" means an equivalent for the value of the land (property) taken.\u00a0 Anything beyond that is more and anything short of that is less than compensation.\u00a0 To compensate is to render something which is equal to that taken or received.\u00a0 The word \"just\" is used to intensify the meaning of the word \"compensation;\" to convey the idea that the equivalent to be rendered for the property taken shall be real, substantial, full, ample.\u00a0 \"Just compensation,\" therefore, as used in section 246 of the Code of Civil Procedure, means a fair and full equivalent for the loss sustained.<br\/><blockquote>\"The exercise of the power being necessary for the public good, and all property being held subject to its exercise when, and as the public good requires it, it would be unjust to the public that it should be required to pay the owner more than a fair indemnity for such loss.\u00a0 To arrive at this fair indemnity, the interests of the public and of the\u00a0 owner and all the circumstances of the particular appropriation should be taken into consideration.\"\u00a0 (2 Lewis on Em. Dora., \u00a7 462.)<\/blockquote>The compensation must be just to the public as well as to the owners.\u00a0 (Searl <i>vs<\/i>. School District, 133 U. S., 553; 33 L. ed., 740.)\u00a0 Section 244 of our code says that:<br\/><blockquote>\"The commissioners shall assess the value of property taken and used, and\u00a0 shall also assess the consequential damages to the property not taken and deduct from such consequential damages the consequential benefits to be derived by the owners.\"<\/blockquote>\"To assess\" is to perform a judicial act.\u00a0 The commissioners power is limited to assessing the value and to determining the amount of the damages.\u00a0 There it stops; they can go no further.\u00a0 The value and damages awarded must be a just compensation and no more and no less.\u00a0 But in fixing these amounts, the commissioners are not to act <i>ad libitum<\/i>.\u00a0 They are to discharge the trust reposed in them according to well established rules and form their judgment upon correct legal principles.\u00a0 To deny this is to place them where no one else in this country is placed:\u00a0 Above the law and beyond accountability.<br\/><br\/>This court, after an examination of the evidence, found that the awards as fixed by the majority of the commissioners and the trial court were grossly excessive; that a just compensation for the land taken was P10 per square meter, and, in a short opinion, rendered judgment accordingly.\u00a0 It was insisted that to so decide this case would be in conflict with former adjudicated cases by this court.\u00a0 It now becomes necessary to review these cases.<br\/><br\/>In City of Manila <i>vs<\/i>. Tuason et\u00a0 al. (R. G. No. 3367), decided March 23, 1907\u00a0 (unreported), the Court of First Instance modified the report of the commissioners as to some of the items and confirmed it as to others.\u00a0 On appeal, the Supreme Court remanded the cause, apparently for the reason that the evidence taken by the commissioners\u00a0 and the lower court was not before it, and perhaps also because the commissioners adopted a wrong principle of assessing damages.<br\/><br\/>In Manila Railroad Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Fabie (17 Phil. Rep., 206) the majority report of the commissioners appraised the land at P56,337.18, while a dissenting commissioner estimated it at P27,415,92.\u00a0 The Court of First Instance, after taking additional evidence upon the consequential benefits to the remainder of defendants' land by the construction of the railroad, and also as to the rental value of various pieces of land in the\u00a0 locality, fixed the value of the land at the sum estimated by the dissenting commissioner.\u00a0 The defendants appealed to this court.\u00a0 This court remarked that the only evidence tending to support the majority report of the commissioners\u00a0 consisted of deeds of transfer of\u00a0 real estate between parties in that community showing the prices paid by the vendees in such conveyances.\u00a0 It was held that without its being shown that such transfers had been made in the ordinary course of business and competition, and that the prices therein stated were not fictitious, such deeds were incompetent as evidence of the value of the condemned land.\u00a0 As to the action of the court in fixing the price of the land at P27,415.92, the court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Conceding, without deciding, that he also had the right to formulate an opinion of his own as to the value of the land in question, nevertheless, if he formulate such an opinion, he must base it upon competent evidence.\u00a0 The difficulty with the case is that it affirmatively appears from the record on appeal that there is an entire absence of competent evidence to support the finding either of the commissioners or of the court, even if the court had a right to make a finding of his own at all under the circumstances.\"<\/blockquote>In Manila Railroad Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Attorney-General (22 Phil. Rep., 192) the only question raised was the value of certain improvements on the condemned portion of an hacienda, such improvements consisting mainly of plants and trees and belonging to a lessee of the premises.\u00a0 The total damages claimed were P24,126.50.\u00a0 The majority report of the commission allowed P19,478, which amount was reduced by the Court of First Instance to P16,778.\u00a0 The plaintiff company, upon appeal to this court, alleged that the damages allowed were grossly excessive and that the amount allowed by the commissioners should have been reduced by at least P17,000; while the defendant urged that the damages as shown by the record were much greater than those allowed, either by the commissioners or by the court.<br\/><blockquote>\"The only ground upon which the plaintiff company bases its contention that the valuations are excessive is the minority report of one of the commissioners.\u00a0 The values assigned to some of the improvements may be excessive but we are not prepared to say that such\u00a0 is the case.\u00a0 Certainly there is no evidence in the record which would justify us in holding these values to be grossly excessive.\u00a0 The commissioners in their report go into rather minute detail as to the reasons for the conclusions reached and the valuations fixed for the various items included therein.\u00a0 There was sufficient evidence before the commissioners to support the valuations fixed by them except only those later modified by the court below.\u00a0 The trial court was of opinion that the price of P2 each which was fixed for the orange trees (<i>naranjitos<\/i>) was excessive, and this was reduced to P1.50 for each tree; this on the ground that the evidence\u00a0 discloses that these trees were comparatively young at the time of the expropriation, and that the value fixed by the majority report of the commissioners was that of full-grown or nearly full-grown trees.\u00a0 We are of opinion that this reduction was just and reasonable.\u00a0 Aside from the evidence taken into consideration by the trial judge we find no evidence in the record in support of the contention of the railroad plaintiff that the valuations fixed in the majority report of the commissioners and by the trial court are grossly excessive, and plaintiff company having wholly failed to offer evidence in support of its allegations in this regard when the opportunity so to do was provided in accordance with law, it has no standing in this court to demand a new trial based on its unsupported allegations of grossly excessive valuation of the property by the commissioners and the court below.\"<\/blockquote>This court affirmed the finding of damages made by the trial court with the exception of an item for damages caused by fire to improvements on lands adjoining those condemned, which was held not to be a proper matter to be considered in condemnation proceedings.\u00a0 The court here approved of the action of the Court of First Instance in reducing the amount of damages fixed by the commissioners as to the value of the young orange trees on the strength of the evidence of record.<br\/><br\/>In Manila Railroad Company <i>vs<\/i>. Caligsihan (R. G. No. 7932), decided March 25,1913 (unreported), it appears that the lower court approved <i>in toto<\/i> the report of the commissioners.\u00a0 On appeal, this\u00a0 Supreme Court reversed the lower court and remanded the case with orders to appoint new commissioners, saying:<br\/><blockquote>\"Under the evidence in this case the award is excessive.\u00a0 Section 246 of\n the Code of Civil Procedure giving to the court the power to 'make such\n final order and judgment as shall secure to the party the property \nessential to the exercise of his rights under the law, and to the \ndefendant just compensation for the land so taken,' we exercise that \nright in this case for the purpose of preventing the defendants from \nobtaining that which would be more than 'just compensation' under all \nthe evidence of the case.<br\/><br\/>\"The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded, with instructions to the lower court to appoint a new commission and to proceed from that point <i>de novo<\/i>.\"<\/blockquote>We will now examine the case (Philippine Railway Co. <i>vs<\/i>. Solon, 13 Phil. Rep., 34) relied upon to support the proposition that the courts should not interfere with the report of the commissioners to correct the amount of damages except in cases of gross error, <i>showing prejudice or corruption<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>In that case the property belonging to the appellant which the company sought to appropriate was his interest as tenant in a tract of land belonging to the Government, together with a house standing thereon and\u00a0 other property belonging to him.\u00a0 He asked that he be awarded for all the property taken P19,398.42.\u00a0 The commissioners allowed him P10,745.25.\u00a0 At the hearing had upon the report, the court reduced this amount and allowed the appellant P9,637.75.\u00a0 The commissioners took a large amount of evidence relative to the amount of damages.\u00a0 The testimony was conflicting as to the value of the house, two witnesses fixing it at over P12,000; another at over P14,000; one at P8,750; another at P6,250; and another at P7,050.95.\u00a0 The commissioners fixed the value of the house alone at P9,500, and the court at P8,792.50.\u00a0 This court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Nor do we decide whether, in a case where the damages awarded by the commissioners are grossly excessive or grossly insufficient, the court can, upon the same evidence presented before the commissioners, itself change the award.\u00a0 We restrict ourselves to deciding the precise question presented by this case, in which it is apparent that, in the opinion of the court below, the damages were not grossly excessive, for its own allowance was only P1,000 less than the amount allowed by the commissioners, and the question is whether in such a case the court can substitute its own opinion upon the evidence presented before the commissioners for the opinion which the commissioners themselves formed, not only from the evidence but also from a view of the premises which by law they were required to make.\"<\/blockquote>Referring to the manner in which the trial court arrived at its valuation of the various items, including the house, this court said:<br\/><blockquote>\"Without considering the correctness of the rule adopted by the court for determining the value of the\u00a0 property, it is sufficient to say that the evidence before the commissioners as to the value of the property taken was contradictory and that their award was not palpably excessive or inadequate.\u00a0 Under such circumstances, we are of the opinion that the court had no right to interfere with it.\"<\/blockquote>From the foregoing it is clear that (1) the testimony was conflicting; (2) that the award as allowed by the commissioners was well within the amounts fixed by the witnesses; and (3) that the award was not grossly excessive.\u00a0 That it was not grossly excessive is shown by the difference between the amount fixed by the commissioners and that fixed by the court, this difference being P1,117.50, a reduction of a little over 10 per cent.<br\/><br\/>From the above review of the cases, it will be seen that this court has not only not decided that the courts cannot interfere with the report of the commissioners\u00a0 unless prejudice or fraud has been shown, but the decisions tend to show the contrary; that is, an award which is grossly excessive or grossly insufficient cannot stand, although there be nothing which even tends to indicate prejudice or fraud on the part of the commissioners.\u00a0 The case at bar is the first one wherein the court changed the award and rendered a final judgment upon the record.\u00a0 Had the court the power to thus dispose of the case?<br\/><br\/>Section 246 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows:\u00a0 \"Upon the filing of such report in court, the court shall, upon hearing, accept the same and render judgment in accordance therewith; or for cause shown, it may recommit the report to the commissioners for further report of facts; or it may set aside the report and appoint new commissioners; or it may accept the report in part and reject it in part, and may make such final order and judgment as shall secure to the plaintiff the property essential to the exercise of his rights under the law, and to the defendant just compensation for the land so taken; and the judgment shall require payment of the sum awarded as provided in the next section before the plaintiff can enter upon the ground and appropriate it to the public use.\"<br\/><br\/>From this section it clearly appears that the report of the commissioners is not final.\u00a0 The judgment of the court is necessary to give effect to the proceedings.\u00a0 Nor is the report of the commissioners conclusive, under any circumstances, so that the judgment of the court is a mere detail or formality requisite to the proceedings.\u00a0 The judgment of the court is rendered after a consideration of the commissioners' report and the exceptions thereto submitted upon the hearing of the report.\u00a0 By this judgment the court may accept the commissioners' report unreservedly; it may return the report for additional facts or it may set the report aside and appoint new commissioners; or it may accept the report in part and reject it in part, and \"make such final order and judgment as shall secure to the plaintiff the property essential to the exercise of his rights under the law, and to the defendant just compensation for the land so taken,\"\u00a0 Any one of these methods of disposing of the report is available to and may be adopted by the court according as they are deemed suited to secure to the plaintiff the necessary property and to the defendant just compensation therefor.\u00a0 But can the latter method produce a different result in reference to any part of the report from that recommended by the commissioners?\u00a0 The purpose of this discussion is solely to determine this question.<br\/><br\/>Section 246 expressly authorizes the court to \"accept the report in\u00a0 part and reject it in part.\"\u00a0 If this phrase stood alone, it might be said that the court is only empowered to accept as a whole certain parts of the report and reject as a whole other parts.\u00a0 That is, if the commissioners fixed the value of the land taken at P5,000, the improvements at Pl,000, and the consequential damages at P500, the court could accept the report in full as to any one item and reject it as to any other item, but could not accept or reject a part of the report in such a way as to change any one of the amounts.\u00a0 But the\u00a0 court is also empowered \"<i>to make such final order and judgment as shall secure to the plaintiff the property essential to the exercise of his rights under the law, and to the defendant just\u00a0 compensation for the land so taken.<\/i>\"\u00a0 The court is here expressly authorized to issue such orders and render such judgment as will produce these results.\u00a0 If individual items which make up the total amount of the award in the commissioners' report could only be accepted or rejected in their entirety, it would be necessary to return the case, so far as the rejected portions of the report were concerned, for further consideration before the same or new commissioners, and the court could not make a \"final order and judgment\" in the cause until the rejected portions of the report had been re-reported to it.\u00a0 Thus, in order to give the italicized quotation from section 246 any meaning at all, it is obvious that the court may, in its discretion, correct the commissioners' report in any manner deemed suitable to the occasion so that final judgment may be rendered and thus end the litigation.\u00a0 The \"final order and judgment\" are reviewable by this court by means of a bill of exceptions in the same way as any ordinary action.\u00a0 Section 496 provides that the Supreme Court may, in the\u00a0 exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, affirm, reverse, or modify any final judgment, order, or decree of the Court of First Instance,\u00a0 and section 497, as amended by Act No. 1596, provides that if the excepting party filed a motion in the Court of First Instance for a new trial upon the ground that the evidence was insufficient to justify the decision and the judge overruled said motion and due exception was taken to his ruling, the Supreme Court may review the evidence and make such findings upon the facts by a preponderance of the evidence and render such final judgment as justice and equity may require.\u00a0 So it is clear from these provisions that this court, in those cases where the right of eminent domain has been exercised and where the provisions of the above section have been complied with, may examine the testimony and decide the case by a preponderance of the evidence; or, in other words, retry the case upon the merits and render such order or judgment as justice and equity may require.\u00a0 The result is that, in our opinion, there is ample authority in the statute to authorize the courts to change or modify the report of the commissioners by increasing or decreasing the\u00a0 amount of the award, if the facts of the case will justify such change or modification.<br\/><br\/>The question now arises, when may the court, with propriety, overrule the award of the commissioners in whole or in part and substitute its own valuation of the condemned property?\u00a0 From a mere reading of section 246 and the remarks just made, it should be clear that the court is permitted to act upon the commissioners' report in one of several ways, <i>at its own discretion<\/i>.\u00a0 The whole duty of the court in considering\u00a0 the commissioners' report is to satisfy itself that just compensation will be made to the defendant by its final judgment in the matter, and in order to fulfill its duty in this\u00a0 respect the court will be obliged to exercise its discretion in dealing with the report as the particular circumstances of the case may require.\u00a0 But generally speaking, when the commissioners' report cannot with justice be approved by the court, one of three or four circumstances will usually present itself, each of which has for its antidote one of the methods of dealing with the report placed at the disposal of the court by section 246.\u00a0 Thus, if it be successfully established that the commissioners refused to hear competent evidence, then all the evidence in the case would not be before the court; the court could not,\u00a0 with reason, attempt to either approve or change the report, as it stood, for the reason that all the evidence of the case would not be before it; and the remedy in this case would be to \"recommit\u00a0 the report to the commissioners for further report of facts.\"\u00a0 Again, if improper conduct, fraud, or prejudice be charged against the commissioners, and this charge be sustained, it would be safer to set aside the award thus vitiated and \"appoint new commissoners\" who could render a report not tainted by these things.\u00a0 But it is to be observed again that this discussion is corifined to a case where no competent evidence was\u00a0 refused by the commissioners and no suspicion rests upon the motives of the commissioners in making the award.\u00a0 When the only error of the commissioners is that they have applied illegal principles to the evidence submitted to them; or that they have disregarded a clear preponderance of the evidence; or that they have used an improper rule of assessment in arriving at the amount of the award, then, in such a case, if the evidence be clear and convincing, the court should be able, by the use of those correct legal principles which govern the case, to determine upon the amount which should be awarded without remanding the cause.\u00a0 When the matter stands in this light, it becomes the duty of the court to make \"final order and judgment\" in which the proper award will be made and thus end the litigation between the parties.<br\/><br\/>In Louisiana, where the procedural law on this point is similar to our own, the supreme court has used its powers in this respect quite frequently.\u00a0 And in this connection, we think it proper to quote from a case which, in some respects, is similar to the one at bar:<br\/><blockquote>\"On the question of the value of the land, 8.34 acres, the commissioners have allowed $2,500 or $300 per acre.\u00a0 The defendant has put in the record the testimony of witnesses claimed to support the allowance.\u00a0 Without disregarding this testimony, it is sufficient to say that the opinions of the witnesses do not seem to be based on any fact calculated to show the value of the land.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 On the other hand the plaintiff has placed before us the titles of defendant of recent date showing the price paid by him (the defendant) for the entire body of land of which the 8 acres are a part; the acts of sale of land in the same neighborhood, and of the same quality; the assessment of defendant's property, and other testimony on this issue of value.\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\u00a0 Giving all possible weight, or rather restricting the testimony of the plaintiff's witnesses to its due influence, and giving, we think, necessary effect to the acts by which defendant purchased, the acts of sale of other land, the assessment of value, with due allowance for underassessment, and the other testimony of record, we reach the conclusion that the award gives two-thirds more than the value of the land.\u00a0 We fix the value of the land at $833.33.\" (Morgan's Louisiana &amp;

Stat, \u00a7 1268) directs that \"the court shall make such order therein as right and justice may require, and may order a new appraisement, upon good cause shown.\"\u00a0 Owing to a constitutional restriction, this\u00a0 provision has been construed to apply only to damages and benefits resulting to landowners in consequence of proposed improvements, the cash value of property expropriated being an issue triable, at the instance of either party, by a jury subsequent to the findings of the commissioners.\u00a0 Subject to this restriction, however, it has been held that the above provision of law gives the court the right to increase or decrease the amount awarded by the commissioners.\u00a0 In the late case of Tarkio Drainage District <i>vs<\/i>.

Gale, judge, sentenced him to the penalty of three years eight months and twenty-one days of <i>prision correccional<\/i>, to\u00a0 the accessory penalties and to the payment of one-half of the costs.<br\/><br\/>On the 7th of June, 1912, two head of cattle belonging to Doroteo Mangubat, valued at P200, disappeared from a pasture in the pueblo of Dasmarinas, Province of Cavite.\u00a0 A few days afterwards, their owner was informed by an unknown man that there were two cows in the interior of a field planted to bamboo, in the barrio of Malagasang, pueblo of Imus.\u00a0 Mangubat, therefore, accompanied by a cousin and an uncle of his and a policeman, went to the said place and found two cows in the care of the boy Eulalio Jaramillo, which were the same two that had disappeared.\u00a0 The animals were taken away and turned over to the office of the municipal president, with a report of what had occurred.<br\/><br\/>The following\u00a0 excerpt is taken from the judgment appealed from: \"From the evidence adduced, the court finds it to have been well established that, during the last months of the year 1911 and until June, 1912, there existed in the municipality of Imus of the Province of Cavite, a band of robbers engaged in the robbery and theft of large cattle and composed of Julian Saulog, Casimiro Same, Marcelo Same, Pedro Same, Patricio Mascardo, Cayetano Sakilayan, Benigno Same, Jose Malaquinpanga and others whose identity is unknown, under the leadership of Julian Saulog, who was then the <i>teniente<\/i> of the barrio of Malagasang Primero; that this band was in the habit of concealing and keeping the stolen animals in the said barrio, in an uninhabited part thereof where there was a hut and a corral under the immediate charge of Marcelo Same and his son, Casimiro Same, and where they were herded by Eulalio Jaramillo; that, during the period referred to, the said band stole stock, including carabaos, horses and cows, some of which were ransomed by their owners, others escaped from the herdsman, and still others were butchered; that the product obtained through the ransom of the stolen animals by their owners,\u00a0 as well as a part of the meat from the animals that were butchered, was always delivered to Julian Saulog; that in the month of June, 1912, Doroteo\u00a0 Mangubat was the owner of two cows'valued at P200 or 1,000 <i>pesetas<\/i>; that on June 7, 1912, the said two cows were\u00a0 tethered in the pasture of the said Mangubat, in the district of Dasmarinas of the municipality of Imus, Province of Cavite, from which place they were stolen by Casimiro Same and Cayetano Sakilayan, acting in behalf of the aforementioned band and under the orders of Julian Saulog, and by them taken to a bamboo grove near the hut of Marcelo Same, concealed there and placed in the care of the small boy Eulalio Jaramillo, where they remained for a period of seven or eight days; then, on the next day after the theft of the said animals, Julian Saulog arrived at\u00a0 Marcelo Same's hut where he held a conferrence with some of the members of his band concerning the ransom price for these two cows, which was fixed at P25 each; that, after the loss of his cows, Doroteo Mangubat, their owner, searched for them everywhere in the municipality of Imus and, on the night of July 14, learned from a man that this informant had accidentally seen two cows in concealment in a bamboo grove near the hut of Marcelo Same; that, as a result of such information, Mangubat called together his relatives and other residents of his barrio and, early in the morning of June 15, they all went to the place designated where they found, in Marcelo Same's hut, the two bandits Casimiro Same and Cayetano Sakilayan, and at some distance therefrom near the bamboo grove, Eulalio Jaramillo, who indicated to the owner and his companions the place where the two cows were concealed; that the owner, upon identifying these cows as those which had been stolen from him, with the assistance of his\u00a0 companions first took the animals, together with the boy Eulalio Jaramillo, to the house of the <i>teniente<\/i> of the barrio, the defendant Julian Saulog, but, not finding the latter at home, they went on to the municipal building where they reported to municipal president Abad the circumstances of the loss and recovery of the two animals; and that in Julian\u00a0 Saulog's house the owner\u00a0 and his companions met Marcelo Same's daughter and daughter-in-law who told the boy Eulalio that he should not say anything to the authorities.\"<br\/><br\/>From the aforestated facts, duly weighed by the lower court in the judgment rendered, the conclusion is drawn that the unlawful removal of the two head of cattle from the pasture where they had been left by their owner, is an established fact, which removal must be qualified as theft, since they were taken away with intent of gain, without violence against the person or force against the things and without the knowledge or the consent of their lawful owner, a crime provided for and punished by articles 517, No. 1, and 518, No. 3, in connection with article 520, of the Penal Code, pursuant to Act No. 2030; for, as the two cows that disappeared from the pasture were, several days afterwards, found by their owner, a policeman and some companions of theirs, in the interior of a bamboo grove where they were tied, it is to be presumed that they were seized in the pasture, taken to and concealed in the said grove and were there kept tied in order to prevent their escape and return; and, therefore, it can not be believed that they, of their own accord, escaped from the place where they had been put by their\u00a0 owner, but, considering the situation in which they were found, the conclusion is inevitable that they were stolen and taken into the said grove to be concealed therein, with the intent thereby of obtaining unlawful gain.<br\/><br\/>Of the two defendants against whom this action was brought, Casimiro Same did not appeal from the judgment aforementioned; the appeal is made by Julian Saulog, who was convicted and sentenced as a coprincipal in the said crime.<br\/><br\/>When a theft of\u00a0 large cattle\u00a0 is committed in any pueblo or rural district of this Archipelago by the members of a gang of thieves, who meet in the country to adopt measures and make plans, either concerning the performance of such criminal acts or for a division of the profits and cash they have derived thereby, consisting in the ransom they obtained by the return of the stolen animals to their owners, which animals had been carefully concealed in a wood until they should be ransomed by the said owners, all the members belonging to the said band shall be considered to be principals in the commission of such acts, although only a few of them actually stole the cattle; all of them shall be held liable for the crime\u00a0 perpetrated, including those who took no material part therein, whenever the performance of the criminal act or acts by any of the members is effected either by direct inducement, by the order or request of the others who took no material part in the crime, or by virtue of a common agreement among them all, or by any other means which, in the hope of unlawful gain, may constitute a real intentional incitement, purposely made, especially by the person among them who exerts an ascendency and decided influence over the others who take it upon themselves or consent to steal the animals.<br\/><br\/>Although it was not proved that Julian Saulog, as <i>teniente<\/i> of the barrio of Malagasang, took any material part in the theft of the two cows belonging to the offended Mangubat, yet, since this defendant was one of the members of the gang organized for the purpose of seizing and making away with large cattle, in order to obtain unlawful gain, it is unquestionable that his share in the commission of the crime was that of a coprincipal, not of a mere accessary after the fact who received a part of the ransom which the members of the band obtained from the owners of the stolen animals, or sometimes a part of the beef from the animals slaughtered and cut up by the members for their common subsistence; for, in view of the defendant Saulog's great influence in the locality as <i>teniente<\/i> of the barrio and of his being, as he was, one of the members who received a share of the profits and products of the criminal undertakings in which the band was engaged, it is natural and logical to presume than he took part in the designs and plans of the other members, and that his proposals and suggestions, as <i>teniente<\/i> of the barrio, in a great measure influenced and determined the commission of the numerous thefts of large cattle in which the said band of criminals was engaged; hence, notwithstanding the defendant's plea of \"not guilty,\" the trial record shows convincing proof of his guilt as one of the principals of the crime charged; but, as its commission was attended by neither aggravating nor extenuating circumstance, the penalty prescribed in article 520, in connection with No. 3 of article 518, of the Penal Code must be imposed upon him in the medium degree.<br\/><br\/>For\u00a0 the foregoing reasons, the defendant Julian Saulog is hereby sentenced to the penalty of four years two months and one day of <i>presidio correccional<\/i>, to the accessories of article 58, and to the payment of the costs of this instance, the judgment appealed from being thus affirmed.\u00a0 No finding is made with respect to indemnity, as the offended party recovered the stolen cattle.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano, C.

The two were \nfound in the same room. Lim Cui was on a bed smoking opium, and Ong To was \nstanding near by. Opium and some smoking utensils were found in the room. At the \ntime of the arrest Lim Cui at first denied ownership of the prohibited articles, \nbut after being addressed in the Chinese language by Ong To, claimed that they \nbelonged to him.\n<p>The only fact as to which there is any real dispute is as to the place of \nresidence of Lim Cui, the contention of the defendant being that the opium and \nsmoking utensils were his property and that he lived in the room where they were \nfound. On the night of the arrest he gave his residence at an unknown number in \nCalle Dasmarinas, but at the trial he testified that he lived with the defendant \nOng To. Cross-examination, however, developed that his wife lived on Calle \nDasmarinas and that she kept his registration certificates and other papers. One \nof the witnesses for the prosecution testified that he knew all the residents at \nOng To's house, and that he had never seen Lim Cui there. The trial judge found \nthat Lim Cui was not a resident of the house leased by Ong To, where the arrest \nwas made; and we are of opinion that the evidence of record sustains this \nfinding.<\/p>\n<p>Evidence was admitted to show that the house had been searched on various \nformer occasions, at which times smoking paraphernalia had been found there, the \nobject sought to be obtained by the introduction of this evidence being to \nestablish the contention of the prosecution that the house was what is commonly \nknown as \"an opium joint.\"<\/p>\n<p>The admission of this evidence was strongly opposed in the court below on the \nground that it was incompetent and immaterial, and its admission by the trial \njudge is now assigned as error. We think, however, that in cases of this kind \nsuch evidence is competent and admissible, provided it is shown that the former \nsearches resulting in the finding of opium or smoking utensils, took place at a \ntime when the house was occupied by, and under the control of the defendant, who \nof course should not be held responsible for acts of former tenants or owners. \n(Underhill on Criminal Evidence, sec. 482.)<\/p>\n<p>The evidence introduced at the trial as to the tenancy of the defendant and \nappellant at the time when the former searches were made is not satisfactory. It \nis true that there was no evidence to the contrary, but there is nothing in the \nrecord which would sustain an affirmative finding to that effect without unduly \nstraining the testimony of the witnesses as to the facts connected with the \nprevious searches. We do not however consider the failure of proof in this \nregard as vital, because the other evidence of record conclusively establishes \nthe guilt of the defendant of the offense of which he was convicted. It is urged \nthat under all the circumstances the presence of opium and smoking paraphernalia \nin Ong To's house is not sufficient to sustain a conviction of the illegal \npossession of these articles. We are satisfied however, that the case comes \nclearly within the doctrine of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Bandoc (23 Phil. Rep., \n14), wherein it was held that proof of facts substantially similar established a \nprima facie case against the accused.<br\/><br\/>There was no satisfactory \nexplanation of the presence of these articles in the defendant's house, and \nunder all the circumstances we see no reason for disturbing the finding of the \ntrial judge that the articles in question did in fact belong to the defendant \nand not to the defendant Lim Cut. It was shown at the trial that the accused had \nbeen previously convicted of the illegal possession of opium on April 23, 1910, \nand this fact, taken together with the fact that at the time of the arrest the \naccused was found furnishing his companion Lim Cui with the place and the means \nfor indulgence in the prohibited vice, sufficiently maintains the sentence \nimposed by the court below We find no error in the proceedings prejudicial to \nthe rights of the accused.

Upon the motion of \nthe fiscal and with the approval of the court the two cases were called for \nferial and heard together.\n<p>Early on the evening of April 29,1913, between the hours of 7 and 10 o'clock, \nIsidoro Montana, the justice of the peace of Santa Barbara, Iloilo Province, was \nseated in his house conversing with three visitors named Pedro Sosteguer, Lucio \nSumbang, and Nicasio Soguera. Suddenly two men armed with bolos entered the \nsala, one of whom seized the justice of the peace by the hand and struck him \nacross the forehead with a bolo. The justice of the peace picked up a chair and \nattempted to ward off the repeated blows of his assailants, and in retreating \nstumbled over another chair and fell to the ground. At this juncture Pedro \nSosteguer came to his rescue and seizing his assailant by the leg, threw him on \nthe floor, whereupon the other intruder struck Sosteguer across the stomach with \nhis bolo. In the meantime the justice of the peace had managed to make his \nescape by one of the windows. Before the intruders left, one of them struck and \nwounded in the back a boy who had been sleeping on a bench in the kitchen and \nwas awakened by the melee. The evidence conclusively establishes the \nprosecution's contention that the men who entered the house and committed the \nassault were the defendants and appellants, who appear to have been well known \npersonally to the justice of the peace and the other witnesses called for the \nprosecution. Ill-will engendered by litigation over a disputed boundary was \nshown to have been the motive which led the accused to attack the justice of the \npeace; the dispute between the defendant Hudieres and Montano, the justice of \nthe peace, having gone to such lengths that Hudieres had been arrested and \nconfined in the municipal jail because of certain threats made by him against \nMonta\u00f1o.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants attempted to prove an alibi and called several witnesses who \ntestified that they .had seen them in the town of Cabatuan between the hours of \n6 and 9 o'clock on the night of the assault. Without reviewing in detail the \ntestimony of the witnesses for the defense, it is sufficient for us to say that \nwe think the trial judge properly held it to be unworthy of credence. In itself \nit is neither satisfactory nor convincing, and it is wholly insufficient to put \nin doubt the clear, explicit, and positive identification of the defendants by \nthe witnesses for the prosecution.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for appellants contends that the trial court erred:<\/p>\n<p>(1) In the method employed in the examination of witnesses for the defense, \nthus depriving the defendants, of. a fair and impartial trial; (2) in trying the \ndefendants on three separate and distinct charges without the consent of the \ndefendants; (3) in sentencing the defendants to the punishment of <em>cadena \nperpetua<\/em> without specifying to which particular charge the penalty applies; \n(4) in sentencing the defendants without rendering a final judgment on all of \nthe charges and in construing the alleged acts as one act under article 89 of \nthe Penal Code.<\/p>\n<p>The first assignment of error has its basis in the claim of counsel that the \ntrial judge went to unjustifiable lengths in examining some of the witnesses \ncalled for the defense. It is very clear, however, from a review of the whole \nproceedings that the only object of the trial judge in propounding these \nquestions was to endeavor as far as possible to get at the truth as to the facts \nto which the witnesses were testifying. The right of a trial judge to question \nthe witnesses with a view to satisfying his mind upon any material point which \npresents itself during the trial of a case over which he presides is too well \nestablished to need discussion. The trial judges in this jurisdiction are judges \nof both the law and the facts, and they would be negligent in the performance of \ntheir duties if they permitted a miscarriage of justice as a result of a failure \nto propound a proper question to a witness which might develop some material \nfact upon which the judgment in the case should turn. So in a case where a trial \njudge sees that the degree of credit which he is to give the testimony of a \ngiven witness may have an important bearing upon the outcome, there can be no. \nquestion that in the exercise of a sound discretion he may put such questions to \nthe witness as will enable him to formulate a sound opinion as to the ability or \nthe willingness of the witness to tell the truth. The questions asked by the \ntrial judge in tjtie case at bar were in our opinion entirely proper, their only \npurpose being to clarify certain obscure phases of the case; and while we are \ninclined to agree with counsel that some of the observations of the trial judge \nin the course of his examination might well have been omitted, there is no \nreason whatever to believe that the substantial rights of the defendants were in \nanywise prejudiced thereby.<\/p>\n<p>The second assignment of error is sufficiently disposed of by a reference to \nthe doctrine laid down in the case of the United States <em>vs.<\/em> Lampano (13 \nPhil. Rep., 409, 412).<\/p>\n<p>The third assignment of error we think is wholly without merit, because a \nreading of the opinion and the judgment of the trial court clearly discloses \nthat he found the defendants and appellants guilty of the acts charged in both \ninformations, committed with treachery (<em>alevosia<\/em>), that is to say, of \nthe crimes of assassination and frustrated assassination.<\/p>\n<p>As to the fourth assignment of error it must be admitted that the trial judge \nerred in failing to impose upon the defendants a separate penalty for the crime \nof frustrated assassination of which he found the defendants guilty in addition \nto the penalty of <em>cadena perpetua,<\/em> which is the medium degree of the \npenalty prescribed for the crime of assassination, of which he also found the \ndefendants guilty. It appears that the trial judge regarded the acts committed \nby the defendants in killing one victim and in wounding the other two as a \nsingle offense, merged in the highest offense with which they were charged, all \nhaving been committed at one and the same time.<\/p>\n<p>The trial judge evidently had in mind the provisions of article 89 of the \nPenal Code, which prescribes that where a single act constitutes two or more \ncrimes, or where one crime is committed as a necessary means to commit the \nother, the penalty imposed for the more serious offense will be applied in its \nmaximum degree. In imposing sentence he says, \"These two crimes committed in one \nact will be considered as one act and of the highest crime committed.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the case at bar, however, the murder and the two separate assaults were \nmanifestly separate and distinct offenses for each of which the accused were \nliable to trial and punishment. (U. S. <em>vs<\/em>. Flemister, 1 Phil. Rep., \n317, 354; 4 Phil. Rep., 300; 5 Phil. Rep., 650; 207 U. S., 372; U. S. \n<em>vs.<\/em> Beecham, 15 Phil. Rep., 272, 336, 671, 672.) The cases contemplated \nin the eighty-ninth article of the Penal Code are of a wholly different \ncharacter. (U. S. vs. Ferrer, 1 Phil. Rep., 56, 62.; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Abijan, \n1 Phil. Rep., 83, 85; U. S. vs. Tanjuanco et al., 1 Phil. Rep., 117; U. S. \n<em>vs.<\/em> Llames, 1 Phil. Rep., 130,132; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Pascua, 1 Phil. \nRep., 631, 632; U.

S. <em>vs.<\/em> Montiel, 9 Phil. \nRep., 162, 167.)<\/p>\n<p>The-penalty imposed by the trial judge, which was that of <em>cadena \nperpetua,<\/em> being the medium degree of the penalty prescribed for the crime \nof assassination, is manifestly the penalty which should have been imposed upon \nthe accused upon conviction of the unlawful taking of the life of Sosteguer, \nmarked with the qualifying circumstance of treachery, and should therefore be \naffirmed. The failure of the trial judge to impose a separate penalty on account \nof the crime of frustrated assassination cannot be said to prejudice the \ndefendants and appellants. The principal penalty imposed being that of \n<em>cadena perpetua,<\/em> we do not deem it necessary to return the record \nmerely for the purpose of having an additional and smaller penalty imposed upon \nthe defendants, nor to review the record ourselves with a view to determining \nthe precise penalty which should be imposed.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of the trial court convicting the defendants and appellants of \nthe crime of assassination without extenuating or aggravating circumstances, and \nsentencing them to <em>cadena perpetua<\/em> together with the accessory \npenalties prescribed by law should be and is hereby affirmed, with the costs of \nthis instance against the appellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Cristal was near the inclosed lot where Candido Aquino had \nhis carabao quarantined, in the territory of the pueblo of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur. \nAquino inflicted upon him four wounds, the first a stab in the right shoulder \nnear the spinal column, which penetrated his chest; the second in the upper \nright portion of his breast, which also penetrated his chest; the third in the \nlower part of the same region near the diaphragm and the fourth in the middle of \nhis neck near the larynx. As a result of these wounds the victim fell face \ndownwards on the ground and must have died a few moments afterwards.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of the occurrence, Braulio Cacatian was leaving his house in \nsearch of fodder for his carabao and, upon going by the place, saw the corpse \nwith spots of blood on its back; he also saw his uncle, Candido Aquino, near the \nplace where the corpse was. Cacatian asked him who had killed the man stretched \nout on the ground and the person addressed answered that he himself had killed \nhim, whereupon Cacatian, amazed and terrified, went back into his house to get \naway from the accused, without asking any further questions about the affair. \nCandido Aquino there-upon returned to his house with his shirt stained with \nblood, and there told his son, Nemesio Aquino, 19 years old, that he had killed \nCeferino Cristal, but did not state his reason.<\/p>\n<p>A little while later in the same morning Candido Aquino went to the garden of \nMariano Liberato, the lieutenant of the barrio, approached the place where \nLiberato was working, and voluntarily stated to him that he had killed the \nunfortunate Ceferino Cristal. But the lieutenant of the barrio, doubting the \ntruth of the occurrence, went to the place where the corpse wad said to be and \nthere actually saw it stretched out on the ground. He did not inquire into the \nmotive or make any investigation, because of his fear, but conducted the accused \nto the house of the councilman of the barrio. There the accused was placed under \narrest and taken to the justice of the peace, Rufino Viloria, before whom, upon \nexamination, he pleaded guilty, affirming that he had killed Ceferino Cristal \nwith a knife because the latter had attempted to take away a carabao of his.<\/p>\n<p>The facts set forth constitute the crime of homicide, penalized under article \n404 of the Penal Code, for Ceferino Cristal was violently done to death by means \nof a deadly weapon; but it has not been ascertained whether any qualifying \ncircumstance concurred in the commission of the crime, which must therefore be \nclassified merely as simple homicide.<\/p>\n<p>At the trial of the case the accused did not plead guilty, nor did he on his \npart reveal the motive that induced him to kill the deceased; but his counsel \nalleged that the court erred in finding him guilty and in imposing upon him the \npenalty for the crime of homicide, and in not dismissing the case and acquitting \nthe accused, saying, moreover, that evidence of the guilt of the accused was \nlacking, and that the circumstantial evidence was not sufficient for his \nconviction.<\/p>\n<p>In spite of these allegations the case furnishes circumstantial evidence \nwhich produces in the mind, beyond all doubt, complete proof of the guilt of the \naccused as the sole proven author by direct participation of the violent death \nof Ceferino Gristal. The fact that the accused Aquino was seen with his shirt \nstained with blood near the place where the corpse was stretched out; the free \nand voluntary statement that he made to Braulio Cacatian that he had killed the \ndeceased, Ceferino Cristal; also the statement that he afterwards made in his \nhouse to his own son, Nemesio Aquino, who saw his father's shirt covered with \nblood, that he had killed the deceased; the third statement, also voluntary, \nthat he made a few hours afterwards to Mariano Liberate, the lieutenant of the \nbarrio, who, doubting the truth of the occurrence, went to the place where the \ncorpse lay, guided by the accused himself; and the confession that he afterwards \nmade to the justice of the peace who conducted the preliminary examination, and \nto whom he stated that the motive which led him to kill the deceased was that \nthe latter had attempted to take away his carabao\u2014the declarations of these four \nwitnesses, one of them the son of the accused himself, constitute conclusive and \ndecisive proof of his guilt as the undoubted author of the violent death of the \nsaid Ceferino Cristal.<\/p>\n<p>The courts must apply the penalties set forth in the code when the guilt of \nthe accused is proven by any of the duly accepted means, according to the rules \nof sound judgment. Among these, grave and convincing circumstantial evidence may \nserve as ground for the conviction, when it is derived from facts duly proven, \nwhen there exists more than one circumstance, and when the combination and \nconnection of the circumstances leave no reasonable doubt of the guilt of the \naccused, in the ordinary and natural course of hu man affairs.<\/p>\n<p>This case offers more than two circumstances, and the merits and facts which \nit brings out demonstrate the guilt of the accused in a positive manner. No \naggravating circumstance is to be considered as concurring in the commission of \nthe crime, but the special circumstance established in article 11 of the Code in \nconnection with Act No, 2142 must be applied.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment \nappealed from are deemed to have been refuted, it is proper to affirm the same, \nas we hereby do, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

SERVANDO BAY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The information in this case charges the appellant, Servando Bay, with the \ncrime of rape, committed as follows:\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"On the night of June 7 of the present year, 1913, in the barrio of San \nTeodoro of the township of Calapan, Mindoro, in the jurisdiction of this Court \nof First Instance, the above-named accused accidentally met Florentina Alcones \nwalking along the beach, and, on finding that she was alone, did maliciously and \ncriminally drag her toward a place covered with underbrush, and there by means \nof force and intimidation did lie with her against her will.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution is substantially as \nfollows: That the complaining witness and the accused are neighbors: that about \n7 o'clock in the evening of June 7, 1913, when returning from her rice field she \nwas joined by the accused, and that a short distance from the mouth of the \nSubaan River he caught hold of her, picked her up, and carried her to the edge \nof some thickets, where he threw her on the ground and attempted to have carnal \nintercourse with her; that angered by her resistance he drew his dagger, and \nforced her under threat of her life to accede to his desires; that, a party who \nwere passing near the place where the crime was committed heard her cries, and \nput into shore; that one of the party stepped ashore, and seeing the accused get \nup from the place where the woman claims the crime was committed, asked \"What's \nthis?;\" that the accused made no explanation of his conduct or his presence \nthere, and left the place forthwith; that immediately thereafter the woman, \naccompanied by some of the party from the boat, went to the councilman of the \nbarrio and made complaint; that the accused, having been brought before the \ncouncilman and asked had he committed the crime of which he was charged, \nadmitted that he had; that thereafter the accused was sent to the justice of the \npeace, who held him for trial.<\/p>\n<p>Upon this evidence the accused was convicted in the court below of the crime \nwith which he is charged in the information and sentenced to seventeen years \nfour months and one day of <em>reclusion temporal,<\/em> together with the \naccessory penalties.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for appellant lays great stress upon certain apparent contradictions \nand inconsistencies in the testimony of some of the witnesses for the \nprosecution, and vigorously contends that the trial court erred in accepting as \ntrue the testimony of the complaining witness and of the witnesses called by the \nprosecution to corroborate her. He emphasizes what he calls the inherent \nimprobability of the story told by the offended woman, and points to the fact \nthat she appears to be much more than twice the age of the accused, and anything \nbut attractive in her personal appearance. His contention is that the charge of \nrape is a pure fabrication, and that it was brought by the woman for the sole \npurpose of wreaking her vengeance and spite upon the accused, with whom she had \nhad a quarrel over the trespass of one of his carabaos on her land.<\/p>\n<p>It is true that there are some apparent contradictions and inconsistencies in \nthe testimony of some of the ignorant witnesses called for the prosecution, and \nthat it is somewhat difficult to understand how the accused, a young married \nman, could have been so lost to all sense of right and decency as to assault a \nwoman so much older than himself, a neighbor, and an old friend of his family. \nBut her evidence, supported by that of the other witnesses for the prosecution, \nis so convincing arid conclusive that we are forced to believe that he did in \nfact commit the atrocious crime with which he is charged. <\/p>\n<p>We are not forgetful of the fact that convictions for this crime should not \nbe sustained without clear and convincing proof of the guilt of the accused; or \nthat experience has shown that unfounded charges of rape or attempted rape have \nnot infrequently been preferred by women, actuated by some sinister or ulterior \nand undisclosed motive. We recognize that in cases of this nature it is the duty \nof the courts to scrutinize with the utmost care the story told by the \ncomplaining witness and the witnesses called to corroborate her, especially when \nit appears either that the offended party did not make immediate outcry or that \nthere was any unexplained delay in instituting criminal proceedings. But in the \ncase at bar it conclusively appears that the offended woman sought assistance \nand made formal and official complaint immediately after the commission of the \ncrime under such conditions as practically to preclude the possibility of a \nconspiracy between herself and the other prosecuting witnesses to press a false \ncharge against the accused.<\/p>\n<p>There can be no possible doubt that the party passing in a boat the deserted \nplace where the crime was committed was attracted by her cries and complaints, \nand that the arrival of those aboard was a fortunate coincidence which she could \nnot well have anticipated, had she planned the filing of false charges against \nthe accused. There can be no question also that she went immediately to the \ncouncilman, of her barrio to make complaint against the accused, accompanied by \nsome of the passengers on the boat. And there can be no question also that as a \nresult, these proceedings were instituted forthwith in the court of the justice \nof the peace.<\/p>\n<p>There is a direct conflict in the testimony as to whether the accused, when \nthe complaint was made to the councilman of the barrio, did or did not admit his \nguilt, and this evidence is so contradictory that it would be difficult if not \nimpossible to make an express finding on this point. But whatever be the truth \nas to these alleged admissions of his guilt, the evidence leaves no room for \ndoubt that neither at the moment when the party in the boat came upon him in \ncompany with his victim nor when he appeared before the councilman upon her \ncomplaint did he claim, as he does now, that her charge that he had assaulted \nher was a pure fabrication, invented for the purpose of wreaking vengeance upon \nhim.<\/p>\n<p>There can be no possible doubt that he was present when the party on board \nthe boat were attracted to the place where she raised her outcry charging him \nwith the assault, and that he was present later on when she presented her \ncomplaint to the councilman of the barrio. Under such circumstances, we are \nconvinced that an innocent man would instantly, and indignantly repudiate such a \ncharge, and attempt there and then to establish his innocence, explaining how he \ncame to be there present with the woman, and the conditions under which she had \nmade the false charge.<\/p>\n<p>The witnesses called both for the prosecution and the defense go into \nconsiderable detail as to all that occurred at the time when the party on board \nthe boat responded to the calls of the woman and immediately thereafter, and yet \nthere is not the slightest indication in the evidence that there was on the part \nof the accused any such indignant denials and protests as would be expected from \nan innocent man suddenly confronted with such a charge under such circumstances. \nIndeed, his conduct at that time was, to our minds, wholly at variance with that \nwhich might fairly be expected from him, granting the truth of his testimony and \nthat of the other witnesses for the defense.<\/p>\n<p>Having in mind the fact that the trial judge saw and heard the witnesses \ntestify, and upon a full review of all the evidence, we are of opinion that \nthere is nothing in the record which would justify us in disturbing the findings \nof the court below as to the degree of credit which should be accorded the \nvarious witnesses, or as to the guilt of the accused of the crime of which he \nwas convicted.<\/p>\n<p>We find no error in the proceedings prejudicial to the substantial rights of \nthe accused, and the judgment entered in the court below convicting and \nsentencing him should, therefore, be affirmed, with the costs of this instance \nagainst the appellant. So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Moreland<\/em>, and<em> Araullo, \nJJ.,<\/em> concur.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

FULGENCIO CONTRERAS AND JULIAN OCAMPO, APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">On the 3d day of November, 1910, the plaintiff commenced an action against \nthe defendants in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Ambos \nCamarines, for the purpose of recovering the sum of P100,000 as damages \nresulting from an alleged libelous publication.\n<p>The complaint alleged that the plaintiff was a citizen of the municipality of \nNueva Caceres, Province of Ambos Camarines, and was, at the time of the \ncommencement of the action, governor of said province.<\/p>\n<p>The complaint alleged that the defendants were the proprietors, \n<em>directores, redactores, editores, administradores,<\/em> and <em>socios \n<\/em>of a <em>bisemanal<\/em> newspaper called \"El Camarinense\" which newspaper \nwas published in the Spanish and Bicol languages and circulated in the Province \nof Nueva Caceres, in Manila, and in almost all provinces and municipalities. The \ncomplaint set out in full extracts from said newspaper published on several \ndates. The first on the 9th of June, 1910, was entitled \"El Rabudo Affair.\" The \nsecond was published on the 14th of July, 1910, and was entitled \"Balance \nSemestral.\" The third was published on the 4th of August, 1910, entitled \n\"Consumatum Est.\" The fourth was published on the 4th of August and was entitled \n\"Gobierno de Parientes<\/p>\n<p>The complaint also contained further allegations relating to the alleged \nlibelous publications in said newspaper on the 20th and 28d days of October, \n1910.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants, Fulgencio Contreras and Julian Ocampo, each answering for \nhimself, filed a general and special denial. The special denial admitted said \npublications and alleged that they were true and were published in good faith, \nwith good intentions and with justifiable ends and in compliance with their \nlegal, moral, and social duty. They also alleged that said publications were \nprivileged.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants Mariano de la Rosa, Vicente Rodriguez, Frank Silva-Netto, Juan \nSan Buenaventura, Hugo Camps, and Leon Reyes, each answering for himself, \nalleged that they had not written or published, neither had they participated in \nsaid publication of the said alleged libelous articles contained in the \ncomplaint.<\/p>\n<p>Upon the issues thus presented the cause was brought on for trial. After \nhearing the evidence, the Honorable Percy M. Moir, judge, rendered a decision on \nthe 12th day of February, 1918. The decision contains all of the material \nallegations of the complaint, together with a very careful analysis of the proof \nadduced during the trial of the cause. The lower court found that the evidence \nagainst the said Mariano de la Rosa, Vicente Rodriguez, Frank Silva-Netto, Juan \nSan Buenaventura, Hugo Camps, and Leon Reyes was not sufficient to support the \nfacts alleged in the complaint and therefore absolved said defendants from any \nliability under the complaint. The lower court found from the evidence adduced \nduring the trial of the cause that the defendants Fulgencio Contreras and Julian \nOcampo were responsible for the publication of the alleged libelous matters and \nsentenced them jointly and severally to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P12,000, \nas damages done to his reputation and fame, as well as the sum of P3,000 as \npunitive damages, and to pay the costs.<\/p>\n<p>From that sentence the defendants Fulgencio Contreras and Julian Ocampo \nappealed to this court and made the following assignments of error:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"1. The court erred in denying the motion of the defendants, Fulgencio \nContreras and Julian Ocampo, in which they prayed that he should not sit in this \ncase because the said court had sentenced the said defendants in the two \ncriminal actions for libel which were brought against them by reason of the same \nwritings and articles upon which the plaintiff bases his right of action in the \npresent cause, and because the trial court had already formed an opinion adverse \nto the defendants in this case.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. The court erred in deciding that the articles complained of as libelous \nare so in themselves and because this honorable Supreme Court had already \ndecided that they were.<\/p>\n<p>\"3. The court erred in failing to make a finding of the facts upon which he \nbased his belief and decision that the said articles are libelous.<\/p>\n<p>\"4. The court erred in deciding that the only question he had to decide was \nthat relating to the damage and prejudice occasioned to the plaintiff as related \nin his complaint.<\/p>\n<p>\"5. The court erred in deciding that the damages occasioned to the \nplaintiff's reputation, fame and feelings could be estimated, as he did estimate \nthem, at P12,000 Philippine currency.<\/p>\n<p>\"6. The court erred in sentencing the defendants to pay punitive damages and \nin estimating these latter at P3,000 Philippine currency.<\/p>\n<p>\"7. The court erred in sentencing the defendants, Fulgencio Contreras and \nJulian Ocampo, jointly and severally to pay to the plaintiff P15,000 Philippine \ncurrency, and costs.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>With reference to the first assignment of error, we find that the error \nassigned therein was merely a challenge to the qualification of the judge to try \nthe cause. Upon the question of disqualification of judges, we find that section \n8 of the Code of Procedure in Civil Actions provides when a judge may be \ndisqualified. Such disqualification seems to be as follows:<\/p>\n<p>First. When the judge is pecuniarily interested.<\/p>\n<p>Second. When the judge is related to either of the parties within the sixth \ndegree of consanguinity or affinity, computed according to the rules of Civil \nLaw.<\/p>\n<p>Third. When he has been counsel for the parties.<\/p>\n<p>Fourth. Where he had presided in the inferior court and where his rulings or \ndecisions are the subject of review.<\/p>\n<p>Said section 8 further provides that these disqualifications may be waived by \nthe written consent of all the parties in interest, when such written consent is \nsigned by the respective parties and entered upon the record.<\/p>\n<p>Said section 8 further provides that no challenge as to the competency of any \nofficial named shall be received <em>or allowed,<\/em> but if it be claimed that \nthe official is disqualified by the provisions of said section, the party \nobjecting to his competency may, in writing, file with the official his \nobjection, stating the grounds therefor, and the official shall thereupon \nproceed with the trial or withdraw therefrom, in accordance with his \ndetermination of the question of his disqualification. His decision shall be \nmade in writing and filed with the other papers in the case, but <em>no appeal \nor stay of action<\/em> shall be allowed from or by reason of his decision in \nfavor of his own competency, until after final judgment in his court.<\/p>\n<p>From an examination of the objection made by the attorneys to the \nqualification of the judge in the present case, it may be noted that the \nobjection is not based upon any of the grounds of disqualification stated in \nsaid section. The basis of the alleged disqualification was simply that the \njudge had theretofore tried the same defendants for the crime of libel and that \nthe present action for civil damages was based upon the same alleged libel. The \nrecord shows that the lower court made repeated efforts to secure some other \njudge to try the case. Upon his failure, however, to secure another judge, he \nproceeded with the trial. There being nothing in law which prohibited him from \nproceeding with the trial of the cause, we are of the opinion that he committed \nno error in so doing. (Jurado &amp; Co. <em>vs.<\/em> Hongkong &amp; Shanghai \nBanking Corporation, 1 Phil. Rep., 395; U. S. <em>vs. <\/em>Sy Maco, 17 Phil. \nRep., 565.) Considering the fact that he was not disqualified, by virtue of the \nprovisions of said section 8, from trying the cause, it was his duty to go \nforward with the trial. (Joaquin <em>vs.<\/em> Barretto, 25 Phil. Rep., 281.) It \nbeing, therefore, his legal duty to proceed with the trial, a reversal of the \njudgment upon the ground that he did proceed, would be unwarranted. The question \nwhether or not the result of the first trial created a prejudice in the mind of \nthe court which resulted in his failure to properly appreciate the weight of the \nevidence adduced during the trial of the present cause, will be considered when \nwe come to examine the sufficiency of the evidence adduced. We find no reason \nfor reversing or modifying the sentence of the lower court based upon the first \nassignment of error.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the second assignment of error, to wit, that the evidence \ndid not show that the defendants were guilty of the crime of libel, it will be \nnoted that during the trial of the present cause (R. G. No. 8894), by agreement, \nthe proof which had theretofore been presented in causes Nos. 7897<span class=\"style1\"><sup>[1]<\/sup><\/span> and 7898<span class=\"style1\"><sup>[2]<\/sup><\/span> was presented in the present cause. Therefore \nthe only proof which we have before us upon the question whether or not the \ndefendants were guilty of the crime of libel is the proof which had been \ntheretofore presented in said criminal cases. Upon a consideration of the proof \nin said other cases, the lower court found that the facts showed, beyond a \nreasonable doubt, that the defendants were guilty of the crime of libel. From \nthat decision the defendants appealed to this court, and this court, upon a full \nconsideration of such proof, also found that the said facts constituted the \ncrime of libel. Upon a reexamination of the same proof adduced during the trial \nof the present cause, we find no reason for modifying our conclusions heretofore \ngiven in said causes Nos. 7897 and 7898. We find no reason for reversing or \nmodifying the decision of the lower court based upon the second assignment of \nerror.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the third assignment of error, to wit, that the lower court \nfailed to make a finding of facts in his decision, we find, upon an examination \nof said decision, that it contains a very full and complete analysis of the \nfacts adduced during the trial of the cause. The lower court set out in full the \npublications constituting the crime of libel, and showed in detail how said \npublications were libelous. We find no reason for modifying the decision of the \nlower court based upon the third assignment of error.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the fourth assignment of error, in view of the fact that \nthe action was brought for damages resulting from an alleged libel, that being \nthe only purpose of the action, it is difficult to see how the lower court \ncommitted an error in his decision when he said that the only question which he \nhad to resolve in the action was that relating to the damage and prejudice \noccasioned to the plaintiff. There is nothing in the fourth assignment of error \nwhich makes it necessary to modify the decision of the lower court.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the fifth assignment of error, it may be said that the \namount of damage done to the reputation, fame, and feelings of a person libeled \nis one of the most difficult questions which the courts have to decide, for the \nreason that there is seldom ever any tangible evidence by which such damage can \nbe accurately and mathematically measured or estimated. Courts must take into \nconsideration the standing and reputation of the person libeled in the community \nin which he lives, together with many other circumstances and relations, which \nare almost impossible of definition. The damage resulting can not be \nmathematically ascertained. Courts must do the best they can in an effort to be \njust to all the parties. The damage resulting from the libeling of a man living \nin a sparsely settled community, with no political or social relations, even \nthough he might be equally aggrieved, would not be equal to the damage suffered \nunder the same kind of a libel by one living in a thickly settled community, \nwith a high standing socially and politically. In either case, however, the \nexact amount of damage suffered can not be accurately computed. The amount which \nthe courts must fix in such a case, after having reached the conclusion that the \npublication was libelous, is largely dependent upon the opinion and discretion \nof the court. It is not difficult to realize, however, that the damage done to \none's reputation and feelings by a libel such as the present, is great and \nalmost immeasurable. The specific amount of damages, however, to be awarded must \ndepend upon the facts in each case, and the sound discretion of the court. No \nfixed or precise rules can be laid down covering the amount of damages in such \ncases. It is difficult to include all of the facts and conditions which enter \ninto the measure of such damages. The difficulty, however, in arriving at the \nactual damages occasioned by a libel to a man's reputation and fame, does not \ndisentitle him to have an attempt made to assess such damages. (Wakeman<em> vs. \n<\/em>Wheeler, etc., Co., 101 N. Y., 205; Beeman <em>vs<\/em>. Banta, 118 N. Y., \n538; Swain <em>vs.<\/em> Schieffelin, 134 N. Y., 471; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Beham, \n110 U. S., 338; Howard <em>vs.<\/em> Stillwell &amp; B. Manufacturing Co., 139 U. \nS., 199.)<\/p>\n<p>A man's good name and reputation are worth more to him than all the wealth \nwhich he can accumulate during a lifetime of industrious labor. To have that \ndestroyed may be eminently of more damage to him personally than the destruction \nof his physical wealth or health. He may prize his good name more than even his \nphysical wealth or his health. The loss is immeasurable. No amount of money can \ncompensate him for his loss. (Worcester vs. Ocampo, 22 Phil. Rep., 42.) The \nenjoyment of a private reputation is as much a constitutional right as the \npossession of life, liberty, or property. It is one of those rights necessary to \nhuman society and underlies the whole scheme of civilization and stable \ngovernment. The respect and esteem of a man's neighbors are among the highest \nrewards of a well spent life vouchsafed to man in this existence. The hope of \nthe good esteem of one's neighbors and associates is the inspiration of youth \nand its possession is a solace in later years. A man of affairs who has been \nseen and known by his fellow men in the active pursuits of life for many years \nand who has developed a great character and an unblemished reputation, has \nacquired a possession more useful and more valuable to most men than the \npossession of lands or houses or silver or gold. The law recognizes the value of \nsuch a reputation and imposes upon him who attacks it by slanderous words or \nlibelous publication, the liability to make full compensation for the damage \ndone.<\/p>\n<p>In the present case the defendants in their answer alleged that the \npublications alleged to be libelous were true. The proof, however, adduced \nduring the trial of the cause, failed to sustain that allegation. In many of the \nStates of the Union the courts have held that in an action for libel where the \ndefendant attempts to prove the truthfulness of the libelous allegations and \nfails, that the allegation is a repetition of the libel and justifies the courts \nin increasing the damages resulting from the original libel. The effect of such \nallegation in the answer and the failure to sustain the same as affecting the \ndamages, however, is not raised in the present case.<\/p>\n<p>The lower court sentenced the defendants to pay to the plaintiff the sum of \nP12,000, as the amount of damage done to his good name and reputation. After a \ncareful examination of the evidence brought to this court, we are of the opinion \nthat the judgment of the lower court imposed upon the defendants, jointly and \nseverally to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P12,000 and the costs, should be \nmodified and that a judgment should be entered against the defendants, jointly \nand severally, to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P2,000.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the sixth assignment of error, the appellants allege, in \neffect, that the lower court committed an error in rendering a judgment against \nthem, jointly and severally, for the sum of P3,000 as punitive damages. The \nright of the courts to impose punitive damages is expressly recognized by the \nLibel Law (Act No. 277). The courts have the same difficulty in arriving at the \nexact amount of the punishment which should be imposed as punitive damages, \nwhich they have in arriving at the exact amount of damages done to reputation, \netc. Considering the fact that each of the defendants has heretofore been \nsentenced to pay a fine of P1,000 as a result of the criminal action for the \nsame libel, and considering that sentence as a part of the punishment, we are of \nthe opinion that the sentence in the present case, imposing upon them the \nobligation to pay P3,000, should be modified and that a judgment should be \nentered against each of them, jointly and severally, to pay to the plaintiff the \nsum of P 500 and the costs.<\/p>\n<p>With reference to the seventh assignment of error, we find no reason for \nmodifying or reversing the judgment of the lower court for the reason that the \njudgment imposed by him was imposed upon the defendants jointly and severally. \nThey each are guilty of the acts which caused the damages to the plaintiff. The \nrecord shows that they acted together. They are joint tort feasors. The record \nfails to show that one was less culpable than the other. Joint tort feasors are \njointly and severally liable for the tort which they commit. The person injured \nmay sue all of them, or any number less than all. Each is liable for the whole \ndamage caused by all, and all together are liable for the whole damage. Joint \ntort feasois are not liable <em>pro rata.<\/em> The damages can not be \napportioned among them, by the courts. The apportionment can only be made by \nthemselves, among themselves. They can not insist upon an apportionment, for the \npurpose of each paying an aliquot part. They are jointly and severally liable \nfor the whole amount.

It prays that said mortgage be set aside, \ncanceled and annulled, and tenders to the defendant the sum of P2,500, which is \nthe face of the mortgage, and interest.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff incorporates in his complaint the mortgage in question in which \nthe said wife executing the mortgage makes the following statement:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That my husband, Pio Mercado, on the 15th of August, 1905, executed a power \nin my favor of the following tenor:<\/p>\n<p>\" 'I, Pio Mercado, a resident of the municipality of Baliwag, Province of \nBulacan, Philippine Islands, by these presents declare: That in accordance with \nthe provisions of articles 60 and 61 of the Civil Code, I hereby confer upon my \nwife, Dona Rita Raiz Mateo, the marital license necessary for her to appear in \nsuit, by herself or by means of an attorney, and to perform whatever acts may be \nto her interest to perform, and finally for every purpose which, according to \nexisting legislation, a married woman is prohibited from doing without the \nconsent of her husband, hereby ratifying all her previous acts with regard to \ncontracts since our marriage.'<\/p>\n<p>\"This consent was signed and acknowledged by my husband on the \nabove-mentioned date before the notary public of the municipality of Baliwag, \nand I declare that it is not revoked but is in full force and effect in all its \nparts.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In said mortgage she further asserts that by virtue of said consent, above \nquoted, she executes the mortgage in question.<\/p>\n<p>A demurrer was filed to the complaint upon the following grounds:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"1. That the plaintiff has not legal capacity to sue.<br\/>\"2. That there is a \ndefect or misjoinder of parties.<br\/>\"3. That the complaint does not state facts \nsufficient to constitute a cause of action.<br\/>\"4. That the complaint is \nambiguous, unintelligible, and vague.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Upon the hearing upon the demurrer argument was confined by the demurrant to \nthe third and fourth paragraphs of her demurrer.<\/p>\n<p>Resolving the demurrer, the court held that the plaintiff, having included in \nhis complaint the statement of the wife in the mortgage that the husband had \ngiven his consent to the acts complained of, and having later in the same \ncomplaint alleged that said acts were performed without his knowledge or \nconsent, the complaint was uncertain, vague, and unintelligible, the court being \nunable to determine which allegation the plaintiff wanted the court to accept. \nUpon this ground the demurrer was sustained and the complaint dismissed after a \nrefusal on the part of the plaintiff to amend.<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the judgment must be reversed. The complaint is \nnot vague in the sense in which, the learned court speaks. The fact that the \nmortgage, which is attached to and made a part of the complaint, recites certain \nfacts which, if alleged in the complaint by the plaintiff would be in \ncontradiction to other allegations of plaintiff in the same complaint, is not \nsufficient ground upon which to find that the complaint is vague and uncertain. \nPlaintiff is bound only by the allegations of the complaint unless the facts set \nout in the instrument itself as incorporated in the complaint, are contradictory \nof the allegations of the complaint. The recital made by the mortgagor relative \nto some act performed by a third person is not in reality a fact set out in the \ninstrument, at least not in the sense in which the date of the instrument, the \nnames of the parties thereto, the description of the land therein, and the \namount of the debt secured are facts set out in the instrument. In other words, \nwe do not understand that the recital of the wife in the mortgage relative to \nthe husband's consent is, under the circumstances, an allegation of the \ncomplaint.<\/p>\n<p>Article 61 of the Civil Code provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Neither may the wife, without the permission or power of her husband, \nacquire property for a good or valuable consideration, alienate her property or \nbind herself, except in the cases and with the limitations established by \nlaw.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Article 1387 of the same Code reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The wife can not alienate, encumber, or mortgage the paraphernal property \nwithout the permission of the husband, nor appear in court to litigate with \nregard to the same, unless she has been judicially authorized for the \npurpose.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the case of Gavieres vs. Administrators (13 Phil. Rep., 449), the court \nsaid:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It being admitted by the defendant that the plaintiff and the said \nmortgagor, Luisa Pena, were husband and wife, then her right to dispose of the \nproperty either conjugal or paraphernal is governed by the provisions of the \nCivil Code, and her right to dispose of the property whether conjugal or \nparaphernal does not depend upon her capacity or incapacity, but upon the will \nof her husband. If it should be considered paraphernal property, then article \n1387 of the Civil Code applies and she could not alienate, encumber, or mortgage \nit without the permission of her husband; if it be considered conjugal property, \neven then she was equally forbidden by law to dispose of the same without \npermission of her husband. (Art. 1416, Civil Code.)\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The court further says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And, moreover, suppose that, under article 7 of the Code of Commerce, it be \npresumed that the wife was carrying on the business with the knowledge of her \nhusband, will the fact that she has authority to conduct a private business \nunder said article by presumption be sufficient to justify her in mortgaging the \nproperty used in such private business? We think not, in view of the provisions \nof the Civil Code which absolutely prohibit her from selling or mortgaging, \netc., either the paraphernal or the conjugal property. We do not believe that \nthe power which is expressly forbidden by the law can be given by mere \npresumption in the absence of an express provision of the law to that effect. \nThe only exception to the absolute prohibition on the part of the wife to create \nliens against the paraphernal and conjugal property is that found in article \n1408 of the Civil Code. The present case is not one of the exceptions mentioned \nin that article.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From the provisions of the Civil Code above quoted and the exposition made \nthereof by the Supreme Court in the case above cited, it is clear that the \nplaintiff, admitting the allegations of the complaint to be true, is entitled to \nhave the mortgage set aside.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed and the cause remanded to the court \nwhence it came, that the same may be continued in the form and manner prescribed \nby law.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

F. Johnson, Justice of the Supreme \nCourt, inviting attention to the in closed papers.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is respectfully recommended that the notary herein referred to be removed \nfrom office under section 82 of Act No. 136.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On May 6, 1912, the Honorable E. Finley Johnson, vacation justice, made the \nfollowing order:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Respectfully forwarded to the clerk of the Supreme Court, with directions \nthat an order be issued under the seal of the court, directed to Eugenio de \nLara, the notary public mentioned in the within annexed documents, ordering him \nto appear personally before the Supreme Court at 9 o'clock a. m. on the 8th day \nof July, 1912, and to show in writing why he should not be removed as a notary \npublic, in accordance with the provisions of section 82 of Act No. 136, for the \nalleged misconduct complained of by the prosecuting attorney of the city of \nManila, and which is fully set out in the documents hereto attached.<\/p>\n<p>\"The clerk will accompany the order herein made by a certified copy of all \nthe documents hereto attached.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On the 8th of July, 1912, Eugenio de Lara presented his answer to the order \nto show cause, in which appear the following paragraphs:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That the complaint of the prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila in this \nmatter refers to a contract of espousal signed and acknowledged before the \nundersigned by Cirilo San Pedro and Petronila Trias, said complaint being \nfounded upon the declarations of Petronila Trias and her father, who allege that \nsaid instrument was drawn by tfye notary before whom it was acknowledged.<\/p>\n<p>\"On the 21st of February, 1912, the said Cirilo San Pedro and Petronila Trias \ncame into the office of the undersigned notary with the documentjn prepared for \nratification. The undersigned read the document and after having interpreted it \nto the parties thereto called their attention to its contents; they said that \nthey were informed as to its contents and that it was in conformity with their \nwill and purpose.<\/p>\n<p>\"The notary before whom the document was acknowledged neither induced nor \ncounseled the parties thereto to execute or sign said document, nor did he \nintervene directly or indirectly in formulating it, which appears from the \nadjoined affidavit of the witness who signed the document and as also appears \nfrom the language and expressions appearing in the contract from beginning to \nend and which show that they never could have been written by a lawyer. There, \ntherefore, exists no basis for the complaint presented by the \nAttorney-General.<\/p>\n<p>\"The mere fact that the said instrument was signed and acknowledged before a \nnotary public, who annexed his name and official seal, is not, in the humble \njudgment of the undersigned, sufficient ground under Act No. 136 to require his \nremoval from office, * * *.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Relative to the issues thus framed the Attorney-General took a considerable \namount of evidence, and after duly considering1 the same presented to this \ncourt, the following report:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The undersigned, Attorney-General of the Philippine Islands, in compliance \nwith the order of this court dated the 10th of July last, transferring to this \noffice the answer and affidavit presented 'by the notary public Eugenio de Lara \nin order that this office might express its opinion with reference to said \ncomplaint, appears before the court and respectfully shows:<\/p>\n<p>\"1. That this office, in view of the denial of Eugenio de Lara, notary \npublic, to having drawn the instrument acknowledged before him by Cirilo San \nPedro &amp;ndf Petronila Trias, presenting in support of his denial an affidavit \nsigned and sworn to by one Regino Talag, obtained the opinion of a typewriter \nexpert in the office of the Constabulary, Mr. Edwin C. Bopp, relative to whether \nthe instrument in question ancTthe answer presented in his defense by Mr. Lara \nwere written on the same typewriter.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. The said expert, after an examination of the two writings by aid of \nphotography, by which the letters and characters were very much enlarged, which \nphotographs are attached hereto, gave it as his opinion that the two documents \nwere written not only upon the same jnachine but also by the same operator, as \nappears from his report which is hereto atfeched. This opinion and the papers \nthereto attached demonstrate clearly that said contract in question was drawn in \nthe office of Eugenio de Lara, in conformity with the testimony of one of the \nparties thereto, Petronila Trias, Mr. De Lara having, in his testimony taken in \nthe office of the Assistant Attorney-General, Mr. Feria, declared that his \nanswer filed herein and referred to above was written by his stenographer and on \nthe machine which he has in his office. <\/p>\n<p>\"3. That, as still further corroboration of the fact that the instrument in \nquestion was written and drawn by Eugenio de Lara, the undersigned ordered the \nAssistant Attorney-General of this office, Mr. Felicisimo R. Feria, to visit the \noffice of Mr. Campbell, where Regino Talag, who gave the affidavit to Mr. Lara, \nworks, in order to take his declaration and that of his companion, who, \naccording to the affidavit of Talag, drew the instrument in question.<\/p>\n<p>\"4. The said Assistant Attorney General went to the office of Mr. Campbell on \nthe 9th of this month and took the sworn declaration of said Regino Talag, as \nwell as of one Nemesio Agor, who, according to Talag, was the one who drew the \ninstrument. From these sworn declarations, which are adjoined hereto, it appears \nthat said Agor did not draw or write the said instrument nor did he know \nanything about it, nor did he see Cirilo San Pedro and Petronila Trias. This \nshows that the declaration of Talag presented to this court by Mr. De Lara and \nrepeated in his sworn testimony before the Assistant Attorney-General is false. \n<\/p>\n<p>\"5. From the foregoing facts it appears: (1) That Mr. Eugenio de Lara is the \none who wrote the instrument which is the object of the present complaint and \nthat, therefore, he did not tell the truth in his answer presented to this court \ndenying that act; and (2) that the sworn declation of Regino Talag presented by \nEugenio de Lara to this court to corroborate his denial that he wrote the said \ninstrument and which also was repeated in his sworn declaration before the \nAssistant Attorney-General is not entitled to any credit \nwhatever.<br\/><br\/>\"Wherefore, we submit to the consideration of this honorable \ncourt that although there exists no penal law affecting the act of Mr. De Lara, \nsuch act ought not to pass without being corrected, especially when we take into \nconsideration that said notary Mr. De Lara is also a lawyer.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Upon this report and the facts presented by the evidence upon which it was \nbased, the Attorney-General initiated a proceeding against said De Lara for the \nrevocation of his appointment as notary public. This court, however, upon said \nreport and evidence, returned the same to the Attorney-General with instructions \nthat, if in the opinion of the Attorney-General the facts warranted it, there be \nincluded in the complaint filed on January 10, 1913, the charge that the said \nEugenio de Lara in an investigation instituted for the purpose of determining \nwhether there was sufficient foundation to the charges against him notary public \nto warrant their prosecution, declaring as a witness, under oath, testified \nfalse and submitted, in support of his false evidence, other testimony which he \nat the time well knew to be false. <\/p>\n<p>Thereupon the Attorney-General amended his complaint by inserting therein the \nallegation found in paragraph 3 thereof, to wit:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"3. That at the investigation held by Mr. Felicisimo R. Feria, an assistant \nattorney of this office, on the above contract on August 8, 1912, the said \nEugenio de Lara testified falsely and submitted the testimony of one Regino \nTalag, well knowing that the same was false.\" <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The prayer of the complaint was \"that said Eugenio de Lara be removed and \ndisbarred from practicing law in the courts of the Philippine Islands and that \nhis appointment as notary public be revoked.\"<\/p>\n<p>The accused attorney having answered the complaint, the matter was referred \nto the clerk of this court as a referee to take testimony. On the completion of \nthe hearings the referee reported the case with the evidence to this court.<\/p>\n<p>Upon the evidence and the record we are satisfied beyond any doubt whatever \nthat the accused attorney upon the investigation instituted in the proceeding to \nrevoke his appointment as notary public, as a witness therein declaring under \noath, testified falsely and did so deliberately, willfully, and corruptly. That \nhe composed and drew the document in question there can be no doubt. The same \ntypewriter was used with respect to the document in question as was used in the \nanswer which the accused attorney filed to the charges made againsthim as notary \npublic. The testimony of the other witnessed of the case and the failure of the \naccused attorney to present as a witness the person whose affidavit he filed in \nsupport of his own sworn declaration that he did not compose or draw the \ninstrument in question, of themselves establish beyond doubt that he is guilty \nof the charges made. When taken together with the evidence of Mr. Bopp, and the \nexhibits presented in connection with his testimony, by which it is demonstrated \nto the point of absolute clearness that the instrument in question was written \nupon De Lara's typewriter and very likely by De Lara operator, his guilt is \nplaced beyond the range of doubt.<\/p>\n<p>Every lawyer who is admitted to practice in the courts of the Philippine \nIslands takes an oath, a part of which is as follows: <br\/><br\/>\"I do solemnly \nswear that I will do no falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in court; * * \n*\" \"Sec. 18, Code Civ. Proc.)<\/p>\n<p>Section 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Disbarments.<\/em>\u2014A member of the bar may be removed or suspended from \nhis office as lawyer by the Supreme Court for any deceit, malpractice, or other \ngross misconduct in such office, or by reason of his conviction of a crime \ninvolving moral turpitude or for any violation of either of the oaths aforesaid, \nor for the willful disobedience of any lawful order of the Supreme Court or \nCourts of First Instance, or for corruptly or willfully appearing as a lawyer \nfor a party to an action or proceeding without authority so to \ndo.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It needs no argument to demonstrate that the conduct of the respondent in \nthis case is a violation of his oath of office, particularly that part thereof \nin which he deposed that he would do no falsehood in court and that he would \nconduct himself in the office of a lawyer within the courts according to the \nbest of his knowledge and discretion, with all good fidelity to the courts as to \nhis clients.<\/p>\n<p>The proceeding for the removal of the respondent notary public was a \nproceeding, in effect, in court, court being the appointing power and the \ncomplaint against the respondent to that end having been presented to this court \nand referred by it to the Attorney-General. <\/p>\n<p>In that investigation the respondent was guilty of the acts in this \nproceeding complained of and thereby violated the oath to which we have \nreferred. The same conduct was persisted in upon the proceeding to disbar him. \nWhile we recognize and deeply appreciate that the permanent separation of a man \nfrom his chosen profession, to which he has dedicated a large part of his \nlifetime and which may be his only support, is a most important and solemn \nmatter, we feel that this case warrants the severest penalty which the law \nimposes and that the responsibility under which we lie both to the public and to \nthe bar demands the action which we take in the premises.<\/p>\n<p>It is hereby adjudged and decreed that said Eugenio de Lara be and hereby is \ndisbarred and inhibited as an attorney and counselor at law of the Philippine \nIslands and as an officer of the courts thereof; that his license to practice \nand act as such be and the same is hereby revoked, canceled, and annulled.<\/p>\n<p>It is further adjudged and decreed that his appointment as notary public be, \nand the same is hereby, revoked, canceled, and annulled, and that his license \nand certificate to practice and act as such be and the same is hereby also \nrevoked, canceled, and annulled.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano C.

saldo de \n15,497 pesos con 32 centimos que arroja la liquidacion Exhibit \"C\" ha sido \nabonado por negarse los herederos de la intestada, como tambien el administrador \njudicial a pagarle

fecha del \npago, sin perjuicio de que en caso de insolvencia el acreedor Bowler podra \nejercer sus derechos contra el abintestato de la finada Matea Alvarez por la \ncantidad expresada, quedando en abonar capital e intereses a la orden del \nacreedor o de la persona autorizada por el mismo fecha 5 de Marzo de 1899.<\/p>\n<p>Cebebrada vista del demurrer con audiencia de las partes, el Juez dicto la \ndecision de que se ha hecho merito.<\/p>\n<p>A ser cierto que Marcos Arcenas en vida recibio todos los bienes en que \nconsistia la herencia intestada de la difunta Matea Alvarez Rubio, como sucesor \nlegitimo de su madre Maria Geronimo Rubio heredera de dicha difunta, asumiendo \npara si los derechos y obligaciones de su causante intestada Matea Alvarez \nhabria razon fundada para afirmar que la sucesion testada o la testamentaria del \ncitado Arcenas, es hoy responsable de abonar al acreedor Guillermo F. Bowler \ntodas las cantidades que la difunta se obligo a pagar en vida y las que se \ncomprometio a abonar dicho Marcos Arcenas como administrador del abintestato de \naquella, o como representante de los herederos de aquella finada.<\/p>\n<p>Empero, como no consta que Marcos Arcenas haya recibido los bienes de la \nintestada Matea Alvarez en concepto de unico heredero de esta, pues que se hizo \ncargo de ellos en un principio como representante de los herederos y luego \ncomo<br\/>mero administrador de la misma manera que lo hicieron Pedro Arcenas y \nmas tarde Pastor Alcazar.<\/p>\n<p>Son bien escasos los antecedentes y datos que ofrece este expediente, pero \neste Tribunal que ha conocido y resuelto en dos ocasiones litigios promovidos \npor D. Guillermo F. Bowler contra los administradores de los bienes de la \nintestada Matea Alvarez, como consta en la pag. 287 Tomo 13 y pag. 576 Tomo 23 \nde la Jur. Fil., no puede por menos de tener en consideracion el resultado y \nmeritos que determinaron las decisiones recaidas en dichos litigios, sobre cobro \nde cantidades adeudadas a Bowler por la testamentaria o abintestato de la finada \nAlvarez y los administradores de sus bienes para la debida resolucion del \ndemurrer opuesto a la demanda del acreedor por el albacea administrador de la \ntestamentaria de Marcos Arcenas.<\/p>\n<p>De los anteriores litigios resulta, que la finada Matea Alvarez dejo al morir \ntres herederos llamados Maria Gronimo Rubio, Manuel Rubio y Victorina Rubio, \ntodos los cuales hansido representados por Marcos Arcenas. Murio la madre de \nMarcos Maria Geronimo Rubio y si aquel es el unico heredero de esta, detalle \nimportante no averiguado, es innegable que dicho Marcos Arcenas sucedio en los \nderechos de su madre a la expresada herencia de Matea Alvarez, Lo que no consta \nen este expediente y en los mencionados es si se procedio a la liquidacion y \nparticion de los bienes hereditarios despues de pagadas las deudas de la finada \ny si se adjudicaron y entregaron los bienes restantes a los tres herederos \nconocidos de aquella difunta, o a los sucesores de estos.<\/p>\n<p>La primitiva deuda contraida en vida por Matea Alvarez consta en el documento \nexhibido en dichos expedientes, el cual se trascribe a continuacion:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Por el presente reconozco ser en deber a Don Guillermo Bowler TRECE MIL \nNUEVECIENTOS QUINCE (P13,915.00) que dicho, senor me ha facilitado en efectivo, \nen calidad de prestamo sin interes, obligandome con todos mis bienes presentes y \nfuturos a devolverle la citada suma dentro de dos anos contados desde esta \nfecha, o sea en diez de Enero de mil ochocientos noventa y ocho.<\/p>\n<p>Y para que pueda hacerlo constar donde convenga a su derecho le doy el \npresente, siendo testigos Don Marcos Arcenas, Don Antonio Laserna y Don Rafael \nRodriguez de esta vecindad.<\/p>\n<p>Capiz, 10 de Enero de 1896. - (Fdo) Marcos Arcenas. - Antonio Laserna. - \nMatea Alvarez. - Rafael Rodriguez.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A cuenta de esta deuda recibio el acreedor la cantidad de 8,000 pesos; y los \nintereses que pudo devengar el capital adeudado, segun lo resuelto en la \ndecision recaida con fecha 23 de Marzo de 1909 en el asunto Bowler contra \nAlcazar administrador de la referida testamentaria o abintestato sera el de 6% \nanual, aunque Marcos Arcenas se obligo a pagar el 10% Exh. \"A\".<\/p>\n<p>Es verdad que Marcos Arcenas en nombre propio y como apoderado general de los \nherederos de Maria Geronimo Rubio se obligo a pagar al demandante Bowler la \nreferida cantidad de 13,915 pesos con sus intereses a razon de 10% anual, como \nya se ha expresado desde el 10 de Enero de 1898, segun documento Exh. \"A\" \nacompanado a la demanda, pero no es menos cierto que al contraer esta obligacion \nasumio para si no solo la deuda de la intestada Matea Alvarez, sino tambien las \ncontraidas por el administrador de los bienes de la misma en nombre propio y en \nel de los herederos de aquella finada.<\/p>\n<p>No se sabe si su difunta madre dejo otros herederos tambien interesados en \nlos bienes de la finada cau sante Matea Alvarez, y como no consta, segun se ha \ndicho, que estuvieren pagadas las deudas de la difunta y se hayan adjudicado \nprevio reparto los bienes restantes, a todos los interesados en la herencia de \nMatea Alvarez, para poder a segurar si con arreglo al precepto del Codigo Civil \nrecibieron o no la herencia con beneficio de inventario, y por tanto es \ninnegable que los hechos alegados en la demanda enmendada del acreedor Bowler no \nson suficientes a producir motivo de accion para reclamar todo el importe del \ndebito que resulta del documento Exh. \"A\" exclusivamente contra la testamentaria \nde Marcos Arcenas, por mas que este contrajo en vida la referida obligacion a \nfavor del acreedor en nombre propio y como apoderado de los otros herederos de \nMatea Alvarez. De dos partes se compone el credito del demandante una \nconsistente en la deuda contraida por la difunta Matea Alvarez en vida y la otra \ncontraida despues de su muerte y corre a cargo de los administradores de los \nbienes de dicha difunta.<\/p>\n<p>En las dos decisiones de que se ha hecho merito especialmente en la primera \nse ha declarado por modo claro y terminante cual es la entidad responsable de la \ndeuda que dejo sin pagar al morir Matea Alvarez, y quienes son los responsables \nde las deudas contraidas por los administradores de sus bienes despues de su \nmuerte, y por tanto no existe motivo legal ni necesidad de reiterarlas como \nparece se indica en el alegato del apelante, quien en sus reclamaciones debio \najustarse a los preceptos de la Ley a cuyo tenor se han dictado las mencionadas \ndecisiones.<\/p>\n<p>En virtud de estas consideraciones, se confirma la decision apelada con las \ncostas, pudiendo el recurrente enmendar su demanda en primera instancia.<\/p>\n<p>Trascurridos veinte dias desde la notificacion de esta decision, dictese \nsentencia a tenor de lo resuelto y diez dias despues, devuelvanse los autos al \nJuzgado de su procedencia para los efectos a que en derecho hubiere lugar<\/p>\n<p>Asi se ordena.<br\/><\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.J., Johnson, <\/em>and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em><\/p><\/div>",

They were convicted and each of them sentenced to pay a \nfine of P200 and one-fourth of the costs, with subsidiary imprisonment in case \nof failure to pay the fine imposed.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants were partners doing business under the firm style and name of \nMadrigal &amp; Co., their principal business being the selling of coal at \nretail. The offices of the company were located at No. 1059 Muelle de la \nIndustria, and their coal yard from which all orders for coal were filled was \nlocated about one mile distant. The orders for coal were received at the office \nand were telephoned from there to the weigher at the coal-yard, who thereupon \nweighed out the quantity of coal ordered and placed it upon the wagon for \ndelivery. This was the practice followed in the case before us. On the 1st day \nof November, 1911, one Lee Tai gave an order to said company for the delivery at \nhis restaurant at the Young Men's Christian Association in the city of Manila of \n1 ton of coal. This order was immediately transmitted from the company's office \nto its coal yard and filled by the weigher weighing out the quantity ordered and \nplacing it upon the wagon for delivery. In this particular instance a full ton \nof coal was not delivered, there being about 140 kilos short. A complaint was \nmade against the four partners individually for a violation of section 30 of Act \nNo. 1519 and a separate criminal information was filed against them. They were \ntried, convicted and sentenced as aforesaid.<\/p>\n<p>The section alleged to have been violated reads, so far as is material to \nthis case, as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Any person who, with fraudulent intent, alters any scale or balance, weight \nor measure, after it is officially sealed, or who knowingly uses any false scale \nor balance, weight or measure, whether sealed or not, <em>or who fraudulently \nrepresents the weight or measure of anything to be greater or less than it \nis,<\/em> shall be punished by a fine of not less than two hundred pesos, nor \nmore than four thousand pesos, or by imprisonment for not less than three \nmonths, nor more than two years, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the \ndiscretion of the court.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The position of the prosecution as stated in its brief is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The prosecution contends that the evidence discloses an absolutely clear-cut \nsituation: An order was given Madrigal &amp; Co. for one ton of coal; in \nresponse to the order a delivery was made, accompanied by an invoice presented \nto the purchaser, representing that the delivery contained one ton of coal; the \ncoal was accepted by the purchaser and subsequently, upon presentation of a bill \nrepresenting that one ton had been delivered, the purchaser paid for one ton of \ncoal; the delivery was not a full ton as represented by the invoice and bill. . \nThese facts give rise to two questions: (1) Is this a 'fraudulent \nrepresentation' as set forth in the statement? (2) Can the defendants be held \ncriminally, responsible for this 'fraudulent representation?'<\/p>\n<p>\"The prosecution contends that such a representation is a fraudulent one as \nintended by the legislature. It is clear that the statute was never intended to \npenalize innocent misrepresentation of weights or measures. For example, a \nstatute would be absurd, if it attempted to penalize a very fat man, who \njestingly remarks that his true weight is only 103 pounds. So also if a person \nin a conversation erroneously states that the weight of a sack of rice is 2 \ncavans. But when something depends upon the correctness of the statement, when \nsome one will be liable to pecuniary loss if the statement of weight is untrue, \nthen we contend that under certain circumstances, such a statement would be a \nfraudulent representation within the statute, irrespective of any intent on the \npart of the person making it. In the case at bar, the mere fact of sending out a \nshort delivery with a false invoice, is sufficient to constitute a fraud upon \nthe purchaser and to be a fraudulent representation within the language of this \nclause of the section.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is true as a general rule that intent is an element necessary to \nconstitute a fraud (23 Am. Dig., 1645). But this does not necessarily require \nthat one who makes a fraudulent representation must have an actual specific \nintent to defraud. Even at common law, if A makes a misrepresentation regarding \nthe financial responsibility of B, or that B is the payee of a note, whereby C \nis induced to advance money or credit, A is responsible for his statements and a \nfraudulent intent is imputed to him, either because he acts carelessly and \nwithout investigation, when investigation could be made (Nevada Bank \n<em>vs.<\/em> Portland Nat. Bank, C. C, 59 Fed., 338), or because his statement \nwas about a matter of which he had special knowledge (Labay <em>vs.<\/em> City \nNat. Bank, 15 Colo., 339, 25 Pac, 704).\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We cannot agree with this argument when applied to a criminal action brought \nunder the statute above quoted.<\/p>\n<p>The statute uses the word \"fraudulently.\" In the sense in which that word is \ngenerally used in law and from the definition of it which has become generally \naccepted, knowledge on the part of the person charged must be shown before a \nconviction can be had. <em>Fraudulently<\/em> selling coal short means knowingly \nselling it short weight. This, in turn, means that the party charged must \nhimself sell the coal or it must be done by some other person through his \ninduction or with his knowledge or consent.<br\/><br\/>The cases of United States \n<em>vs.<\/em> Tria (17 Phil. Rep., 303), and United States <em>vs.<\/em> Estavillo \n(19 Phil. Rep., 478), cited by the Solicitor-General in support of the \nconviction, do not, in our judgment, touch the question at issue. Neither do the \ndecisions of this court relative to criminal libel. A special provision of the \nlibel law makes the owner or proprietor responsible regardless of knowledge. No \ncases have been cited holding the proposition laid down by the prosecution, and \nwe have been unable to find any. All the cases called to our attention or which \nwe have been able to find are to the contrary. The supreme court of Minnesota \nhas discussed a situation quite similar to that here presented. Section 5115 of \nthe Revised Laws of 1905 of Minnesota<br\/>reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>''Every person who shall injure or defraud another by using with knowledge \nthat the same is false, a false weight, measure or other apparatus for \ndetermining the quantity of any commodity or article of merchandise, or by \nknowingly delivering less than the quantity he represents; or who shall retain \nin his possession any weight or measure, knowing it to be false, unless it \nappears beyond a reasonable doubt that it was so retained without intent to use \nit, or permit it to be used, in violation of the foregoing provisions of this \nsection ; or who shall knowingly mark or stamp false or short weights or false \ntare on any cask or package, or knowingly sell or offer for sale any cask or \npackage so marked shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This section was amended, repealed, or substituted by section 6 of chapter \n156 of the Laws of 1911 of that State, which reads as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Any person who shall offer or expose for sale, sell, or use, or have in his \npossession a false scale, weight or measure, or weighing or measuring device, or \nany weight or measure or weighing or measuring device which has not been sealed \nwithin one year, as provided by this law, or use the same in buying or selling \nof any commodity or thing; or who shall dispose of any condemned weight, measure \nor weighing or measuring device, or remove any tag placed thereon by any \nauthorized employee of the department, or shall sell or offer or expose for sale \nless than the quantity he represents; or sell or offer or expose for sale any \nsuch commodities in the manner contrary to law; or shall sell or offer for sale \nor have in his possession for the. purpose of selling, any device or instrument \nto be used to, or calculated to, falsify any weight or measure, or shall refuse \nto pay any fee charged for testing and sealing or condemning any scale, weight \nor measure, or weighing or measuring device, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, * \n* * \"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It will be noticed that the real difference, so far as we are at present \nconcerned, between the two sections quoted is that in the one knowledge, that \nis, fraud, is required and in the other it is not. Speaking of that difference \nthe supreme court in the case of State <em>vs.<\/em> Armour &amp; Co. (118 Minn., \n128), said, at page 131:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is at once apparent, on reading this section, that fraud is of its \nessence. On the other hand, it is equally apparent from the reading of the Act \nof 1911, that the things there penalized are <em>mala prohibita,<\/em> pure and \nsimple, of which, in the contemplation of the law, intent to defraud or commit \nwrong is not an element. It is in this difference between the two Acts that, in \nour opinion, the purpose of the legislature in incorporating in the Act of 1911 \nthe provision in question is to be found. In other words, the legislature wished \nto dispense with the difficult, and often insuperable, task of proving \nintentional wrongdoing on the part of the seller.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Expressing its final conclusion upon the effect of the Act of 1911 the court \nsaid:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We hold that the Act of 1911 is broad enough to cover any case where a sale, \noffer to sell, or exposure for sale of less than actually represented is \ncharged.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This decision was under review in the case of State vs. People's Ice Co. (144 \nN. W; Rep., 962), where a similar question was involved. In that case the court \nsaid, quoting from State<em> vs.<\/em> Sharp (121 Minn., 381):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The question of intent is not material in this class of statutory offenses. \nSuch statutes are in the nature of police regulations and impose a penalty \nirrespective of intent to violate them, the object being to require a degree of \ndiligence for the protection of the public which shall render violation \nimpossible.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The court also quotes from State <em>vs.<\/em> Armour and, speaking with \nreference to section 5115 as compared with section\u20ac of the Act of 1911, \nsays:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Under this Act (referring to section 5115 of the laws of 1905), knowledge \nand intent were ingredients of the offense. Changing the law so as to omit the \nelement of knowledge indicates that the legislature intended to eliminate the \nquestion of intent as an element of the offense.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From these cases it is clear that, as the section originally stood, \nconviction could not have been had under it without showing guilty knowledge in \nthe selling of the goods; in other words, the defendant must have been shown to \nhave knowledge of the misrepresentation. This necessity was recognized by the \nlegislature and that difficulty was removed by the Act of 1911. Under that Act \nconviction can now be had without proof of knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>The difference between the two laws of Minnesota, as set out in the two cases \ncited, presents in relief the precise question before us, especially in view of \nsection 181 of Act No. 2339, passed February 27, 1914, to take effect on and \nafter July 1,1914. Under the wording of the statute the provisions of which we \nare considering, knowledge is an essential ingredient of the crime and no \nconviction can be had without showing knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>It is the undisputed evidence that not one of the defendants had any \nknowledge that the clerk was delivering a less quantity than that asked for. The \naccused have not been connected by the evidence of the prosecution with the sale \nin any guilty sense and are not shown to have made a misrepresentation or \ncommitted a fraud, or of having been privy thereto. As a necessary result the \nconviction cannot be sustained.<\/p>\n<p>In order to demonstrate such knowledge, or to present evidence from which it \ncould be inferred, the prosecution, on the trial, sought to introduce evidence \nof short-weight sales which had been made by the partnership before and after \nthe one set out in the information. This evidence was excluded by the court \nbelow as incompetent under the objection of the defendants. We regard this \nruling as error. Under the theory upon which we are deciding this case, \nknowledge is, as we have just stated, a necessary element, and any evidence \ntending to demonstrate such knowledge is not only competent and material but \nvery important. One of the means of establishing knowledge on a prosecution for \na short-weight sale is to show other sales in which the purchasers were \nshort-weighted, occurring either before or after the sale which is the basis of \nthe action in which the evidence is offered, thereby establishing that the \ncompany systematically gave short weight.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed and the appellants acquitted.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

MCMAHON, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF THE MOUNTAIN PROVINCE, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is a petition for a writ of certiorari to review a judgment made by the \nCourt of First Instance of the Mountain Province.\n<p>The court, when it performed the act complained of, was engaged in the \ndetermination of the ownership of certain real property which had been disposed \nof under a will duly probated in that court. During the settlement of the estate \nthere was presented to the court a petition alleging that one-half of the real \nestate which the testator had attempted to dispose of by the will was not his \nproperty but belonged to his brother; that, therefore, the testator was the \nowner of only one-half of the property thus sought to be devised; that the \npetitioner was the daughter of the brother of the testator and, the brother \nhaving died, she was the owner of one-half of the property disposed of by the \nwill. The petitioner, after other appropriate allegations, prayed that the court \nadjudge and decree that the petitioner was the owner of one-half of the real \nestate described in the will and that that portion be excluded from its \ndispositions.<\/p>\n<p>The court made an order denying the petition and adjudging that all the real \nestate described in the will was owned by the testator. This decree was made and \nentered through a misunderstanding resulting from a bad translation to the court \nof the statement of the parties in interest made in open court, by virtue of \nwhich the court was led to believe that the parties agreed that such a decree \nshould be made and entered. After ascertaining its mistake, the court set aside \nthe decree and made in place thereof the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When this case was called for trial on the 2d day of May, 1913, the court \nunderstood that the parties had come to an agreement by which all the property \nshould be awarded to the legatee in the will, as was interpreted to the court. \nBut the parties have now explained to the court that there was misunderstanding. \nThe court therefore revokes the order dictated on May 2, 1913, adjudging all the \nproperty to the legatee, and will turn this case over to a commissioner to \nexamine the land and witnesses and to report the matter in thirty days. The \ncourt names for this purpose Mr. E. de Mitkiewicz, lieutenant-governor of \nAmburayan, who shall determine what property, if any, in the inventory, belongs \nto the opponent, Antonia Lamadrid, and in case he shall find any of it to belong \nto her he shall state that fact and shall adjudge such part to her; but in case \nhe shall not find any to belong to her he shall adjudge all the property to the \nlegatee, Mateo Labiano.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is agreed between the parties through their attorneys in open court that \nthe decision of the commissioner shall be final with respect to who is the owner \nof the land.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In pursuance of this order the commissioner named therein viewed the land in \nquestion, took the testimony of witnesses for and against the claim of \npetitioner, and, after duly considering the case upon the merits, wrote an \nopinion setting forth the facts as found by him from the testimony of the \nwitnesses, discussed them therein at some length, investigated and considered \nthe questions of law applicable thereto, and arrived at a decision in the \nfollowing words:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"From the above evidence, which was all that was available, it appears that \nAntonia Lamadrid, daughter of the deceased Juan Lamadrid, is entitled to the \nshare of the land which constituted part of her father's estate, but in view of \nthe fact that her uncle Domingo assumed charge of the estate for her, after the \ndeath of his brother, the father of Antonia, I have decided as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\"For the administrator one-half (1\/2) of the estate, and a further one-tenth \n(1\/10) of the estate for reimbursement for taxes, improvements, etc., making \ntris share three-fifths (3\/5), and to the claimant the remaining two-fifths \n(2\/5).\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Sometime prior to the coming in of this decision the executor of the will, \nwho was also sole devisee and who was opposing the petition referred to, having \nlearned, as he says, that a commissioner had been named by the court for the \ndetermination of the questions raised by said petition and that such \ncommissioner had been appointed upon the theory that the parties in interest had \nappeared in open court and consented thereto, made an application to set aside \nthat order and to declare without force or effect the naming of the commissioner \nand praying that the court refuse to accept or act upon his report in the \nmatter. This motion was based upon the ground that the said executor and devisee \nhad not knowingly consented in open court or elsewhere to the appointment of the \ncommissioner but, on the contrary, had always insisted that the cause be tried \nbefore the court itself. Upon the hearing of this motion the court made the \nfollowing order:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This case was called before the court on a motion of the attorney for the \nexecutor, Mateo Labiano, asking the court to set aside a former order naming E. \nde Mitkiewicz commissioner to determine who was the owner of the land in \nquestion in this case and how it should be divided between the parties entitled \nthereto. These parties with their attorneys came into court and made a solemn \nagreement, in fact, asked the court to name the said commissioner in order that \nhe might go out on the ground in question and see and hear the witnesses and \ndecide the case. The court thereupon dictated an order in Tagudin dated May 3, \n1913. Now it appears that one of the parties through his attorney comes in and \nasks the court to annul his former order because he does not wish to abide by \nhis agreement mentioned in that order.<\/p>\n<p>\"The court denies the petition because that agreement was entered into by all \nparties on their own volition and they should abide by the same. The report of \nthe commissioner is hereby approved and the administrator will divide the \nproperty between the interested parties according to said report of the \ncommissioner.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The proceeding in this court for the writ of certiorari is brought upon the \ntheory that the appointment of the commissioner was in violation of law, and \ntherefore illegal and void, and that all that the commissioner did under such \nappointment, including the judgment which he rendered, is also unauthorized, \nillegal, and void and can have no force or effect; that a Court of First \nInstance, in a case of this character, has no authority to name a referee or \ncommissioner except as provided by section 135 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \nand that the appointment in any other manner is without force or effect and \nvoid.<\/p>\n<p>It is undoubted that the Organic Law relative to the Courts of First Instance \nof the Philippine Islands lays upon them the duty of hearing and deciding cases \nthemselves. It is the duty, primarily, of a Court of First Instance to take the \ntestimony presented in the case and to have before him the witnesses who \ndeclare. One of his duties is to see and hear the witnesses as they testify that \nhe may form a correct conclusion as to the degree of credit which should be \naccorded them. While in certain cases and under certain conditions the parties \nmay waive presentation of witnesses and present evidence in some other form, \nthat does not relieve the court from the obligation, without that consent, to \nhear the case himself, to give it his personal attention, to consider it \nindependently, and to form his own judgment as to the merits.<\/p>\n<p>Except by express provision of law, courts cannot delegate their functions \nand where there is a provision permitting such delegation it must be made in the \nform and manner prescribed.; (Hards <em>vs.<\/em> Burton, 79 111., 504; \nVandercook <em>vs.<\/em> Williams, 106 Ind., 345; Wilkins <em>vs.<\/em> State, 113 \nInd., 514; Chandler <em>vs.<\/em> Nash, 5 Mich., 410; State <em>vs.<\/em> \nJefferson, 66 N.

Section 135 provides that \"by written consent of both parties, filed \nwith the clerk, the court may order an action to be referred to one or more \nreferees, to be agreed upon by the parties or to be appointed by the court;\" and \nsection 136 provides that \"in such case, the clerk shall issue, under the seal \nof the court, a commission to the referees named, directing them to proceed with \nthe trial of the action and to report the findings of law and fact to the court \nat or before a time named in the commission.\" Section 137 provides that \n\"referees, before commencing the performance of their duty, shall be sworn to a \nfaithful and honest performance thereof, and the fact that they have taken such \noath shall be certified to on the commission by the authority administering the \noath.\"<\/p>\n<p>None of the conditions prescribed by those sections was complied with in this \ncase. There was no agreement in writing filed with the clerk, no commission \nissued by the clerk and no oath of office taken by the referee. These being the \nonly provisions of law touching the appointment of a referee, it is clear that, \nunder the admitted facts, the appointment was unauthorized, the person appointed \nwas without authority to act, and his proceedings were consequently without \nlegal effect. As a necessary result the court, when it entered the order \napproving the report and judgment of the commissioner and dictated the judgment \ncomplained of, had nothing before it upon which a judgment could be legally \nentered and it was, therefore, without force or effect in law.<\/p>\n<p>From the record it would seem that the court did not examine the evidence \ntaken by the referee or form any independent judgment of its own thereon. As we \nhave seen, the court simply approved the report of the referee without \nconsideration of the facts upon which it was based or the conclusions of law \nwhich led to the judgment formed, evidently relying upon section 140 of the Code \nof Civil Procedure which provides that \"upon the filing of the report or as soon \nas conveniently may be thereafter, the court shall render judgment in accordance \nwith the report, as though the facts had been found by the judge himself, unless \nthe court shall, for cause shown, set aside the report, or order it to be \nrecommitted to the referee for further findings.\"<\/p>\n<p>It results from the record in this case, therefore, that a decision has been \nrendered affecting interests in real estate by one who is not a judge of a Court \nof First Instance and to whom authority to act as such was not delegated as the \nlaw requires. The parties, therefore, have not had their day in court under the \nlaws of the Philippine Islands and have been deprived of their property in a \nmanner which the law does not sanction.<\/p>\n<p>For these reasons we regard the proceedings relative to the appointment of \nthe commissioner and all the judgments, orders, and decrees based thereon, \neither by said commissioner or the court, as null and void and of no legal value \nor effect. The same are, therefore, annulled, vacated, and set aside and the \nrecord of said Court of First Instance sent to this court on this proceeding is \nordered returned for further. proceedings in pursuance of law.<\/p>\n<p>We desire that it be clearly understood that we are not passing upon the \nmerits relative to the ownership of the real estate involved in the litigation \nreferred to, but simply upon the jurisdiction of the court in making the order \ncomplained of. It may well be that the decision of the referee was right upon \nthe merits. As to that, we have nothing to say, as it does not affect the \nvalidity of the order before us.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><em>Proceedings annulled and record remanded for further \nproceedings.<\/em><\/p><\/div>",

But we agree with the trial judge that the evidence \nof record conclusively establishes the falsity of the account of what occurred \nas given by the accused.<\/p>\n<p>The auditor testified that when the accused came to him on June 14 to tell \nhim that the money was in the safe, he asked the accused when he had put it \nthere, and that the accused then and there admitted that he had put the money in \nthe safe at about half past 5 of the afternoon of the day before (June 13) after \nthe inspection had been completed. Counsel for appellant does not question the \nfact that this admission was made to the auditor, though he does contend that \nthe evidence as to this admission should be disregarded, on the ground that it \nwas incompetent and inadmissible.<\/p>\n<p>We are of opinion that the evidence fully sustains the trial judge in \nrefusing to accept as true the story told by the accused on the witness stand, \nand especially his claim that, through an oversight, the money in question had \nnot been placed with the other government funds in his safe, but had remained \nuntouched in the safe in his office, together with his personal funds, from the \ntime it was received until the day after the inspection, when he informed the \nauditor that it was in the safe.<\/p>\n<p>The failure of the accused to make any note of the receipt of the money in \nthe books and accounts of his office; his substitution of a nonofficial receipt \nin lieu of the prescribed official receipt which it was his duty to give the \nperson from whom he received the money; the fact that this money was not turned \nover by him at the time of the inspection of his office by the auditor, and that \nhe made no reference to it until a criminal prosecution had been instituted \nagainst him the day after the inspection; and finally his admission to the \nauditor that he had returned the money to the safe a few hours after the \ninspection, all conclusively establish the fact that he misappropriated these \nfunds, and leave no room for doubt as to the falsity of his claim that he had \nforgotten all about the receipt of this substantial sum of money until after the \ninspection, and that it had been lying in the drawer with his personal funds \nfrom the time when it was received until the day after the inspection when he \nreported the matter to the auditor.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel for the accused does not attempt to question the truth of the \ntestimony of the auditor as to the admission of the accused that he had put the \nmoney in the safe on the afternoon of the day of the inspection of his property \nand accounts. Counsel contends, however, that this evidence was incompetent and \nshould not be taken into consideration, because as counsel contends: First, it \nwas not first made to appear that it was freely and voluntarily made, without \ncompulsion or inducement; and second, it was not made under oath.<\/p>\n<p>These contentions of counsel cannot be maintained. Counsel relies chiefly on \nthe statutory provisions which forbid the introduction of testimony as to \nextrajudicial confessions unless it is first made to appear that the alleged \nconfession was made freely and voluntarily and without inducement or compulsion. \nBut a distinction must be made between confessions and admissions. A confession, \nas distinguished from an admission, is a declaration made at any time by a \nperson, voluntarily and without compulsion or inducement, stating or \nacknowledging that he had committed or participated in the commission of a \ncrime. The term admission, on the other hand, is usually applied in criminal \ncases to statements of fact by the accused which do not directly involve an \nacknowledgment of the guilt of the accused or of criminal intent to commit the \noffense with which he is charged. The statutory provision excluding evidence as \nto confessions until and unless the prescribed foundation is laid is not \napplicable to admissions, which do not amount to confessions although they may \nbe sufficient, when taken together with other evidence of surrounding \ncircumstances, to sustain an inference of the guilt of the accused. The reason \nfor the rule excluding evidence as to confessions unless it is first made to \nappear that they are made voluntarily does not apply in cases of admissions, \nalthough, of course, evidence of the fact that a particular statement was made \nunder duress would tend very strongly to destroy its evidentiary value. It is \nvery clear from all the evidence, and from the circumstances under which the \nstatement was made by the accused to the auditor, that it was not made under \nduress, and we are of opinion that the trial judge properly took it under \nconsideration as evidence against the accused.<\/p>\n<p>There is no provision of law which prescribes that either confessions or \nadmissions are not competent evidence unless made under oath. It is the fact \nthat they are made by the accused and against his own interest which gives to \nthem their evidentiary value, and provided the fact is established it does not \nmatter whether they are made under oath or not.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment entered in the court below should be affirmed, with the costs of \nthis instance against the appellant.

Gale, judge of the Court of First Instance. In the said judgment, it \nwas held that the plaintiff was the absolute owner in fee simple and entitled to \nthe possession of the parcel of land in question, and the defendant, who \nunlawfully held the said land, was ordered immediately to restore possession \nthereof to the plaintiff and to pay the costs in the Court of First Instance and \nthe justice of the peace court. The defendant was also perpetually enjoined from \nin any manner disturbing1 the plaintiff in her possession of the said land.\n<p>On May 9, 1912, Evarista Sinapilo, with the permission of her husband, sued \nin the justice of the peace court of Candelaria, Tayabas, for the recovery of \npossession of a parcel of land belonging to her, valued at P150, which had been \ndetained and held since the previous year by the defendant, Petra Gracia, but \nthe latter, in her answer, denied that the plaintiff possessed any title of \nownership to the said land or that she, the defendant, had unlawfully held and \ndetained the land in question, and she therefore prayed that she be absolved \nfrom the complaint, with the costs against the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>After a hearing of the case, the justice of the peace rendered judgment for \nthe plaintiff, from which the defendant appealed to the Court of First \nInstance.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff consequently reproduced before the said appellate court the \ncomplaint she had filed in the justice of the peace court. Counsel for the \ndefendant, after denying each and all of the paragraphs of the same, excepting \nthe facts admissible at trial and in special defense, alleged in an additional \nanswer that the land in dispute was acquired by the defendant and her deceased \nhusband, Juan Gala, from Tomas Regidor, in 1889; that since that time she had \nheld the property quietly, peaceably and without any interruption whatever, and \nthat the plaintiff's action had already prescribed. Said counsel therefore \nprayed that the defendant be absolved from the complaint, with the costs against \nthe plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>After trial in the Court of First Instance the judgment aforementioned was \nrendered, to which counsel for the defendant excepted and moved for a new \nhearing. This motion was denied by an order of February 7, 1913, and the \ndefendant entered a written exception and announced her intention to file a bill \nof exceptions because Acts Nos. 2041 and 2131 of the Philippine Legislature, \nwhich are in conflict with the Philippine Bill of July 1, 1902, and the Organic \nAct, No. 186, were applied in the present case; she further alleged that the \njudgment was executed over the protest of the defendant that her motion for \nrehearing was still pending.<\/p>\n<p>By a written motion of March 3, 1913, plaintiff's counsel prayed that the \nexception taken on the 13th of the previous month of February against the said \njudgment be overruled and the bill of exceptions presented be rejected, because \nthe judgment of the Court of First Instance, being rendered on appeal from the \ncourt of the justice of the peace of Candelaria, was already conclusive and \nfinal. He maintained that the constitutional question set up as a ground for the \ndefendant's appeal was not raised either in the justice of the peace court or in \nthe Court of First Instance, neither before nor after the rendering of judgment \nby.the latter tribunal, but only after twelve days had elapsed from the denial \nof the motion for a rehearing; that both the exception to the order issued on \nthe motion for a rehearing and the. bill of exceptions were filed after time, \nfor as the said motion was denied on February 7, 1913, the defendant failed to \ntake exception thereto within the legal period, and furthermore had no intention \nof excepting to that ruling, inasmuch as on the 15th of the same month of \nFebruary counsel for the son of the defendant Petra Gracia filed a suit in the \nCourt of First Instance against Antonio Ona and his wife, the plaintiff Evarista \nSinapilo, with respect to the very same land, involved in the present suit; that \nhe mentioned therein as one of the causes of action the fact that the said \nspouses were in possession of the land in litigation by reason of the judgment \nof December 16,1912, now appealed from, and he submitted a copy of the said \nwritten complaint; that not till the 19th of the same month did the defendant \nfor the first time raise the question of the constitutionality of the laws \naforementioned and take exception to the judgment of the Court of First \nInstance, after it had already become final. Counsel therefore prayed that the \ncourt grant the prayer of his petition, and, in case it should be disallowed, \nthat the court order the present motion, the ruling thereon and, if a denial, \nhis exception thereto, included in the bill of exceptions. Both the regular and \nthe additional bills of exceptions having been filed, they were approved and \nsent up with a transcript of the record of the proceedings referred to by the \nappellant, and of the parol evidence, to the clerk of this court.<br\/><br\/>In \norder to determine whether or not the Court of First Instance lacked \njurisdiction to render the judgment appealed from, it becomes necessary to \ninquire whether the constitutional question and that of the jurisdiction of the \njustice of the peace of Candelaria to try the action for recovery of possession \nbrought by Evarista Sinapilo, who, as owner, demanded the restitution of a piece \nof her land valued at P150, were brought up in due time at the hearing.<\/p>\n<p>That the action for recovery brought by the plaintiff against the defendant, \nby reason of the latter's unlawful usurpation and detention of the land in \nquestion, was not one that lay within the jurisdiction of the justice of the \npeace court of Calendaria, is undoubted, since it involved the title and \nownership of real estate. Therefore the trial held before the said justice of \nthe peace is completely null and void and can produce no legal effect whatever \nbecause of his clear lack of jurisdiction to try the question brought up before \nhim by the interested parties relative to the ownership of a piece of land.<\/p>\n<p>However, the defendant having appealed from the judgment rendered by the \njustice of the peace in favor of the plaintiff, the case in its entirety was \nheard by the Court of First Instance, and during the whole course of the trial \nuntil the judgment appealed from was rendered on December 16,1912, no \nconstitutional question whatever was raised and no exception was taken to the \nlack of jurisdiction of the justice of the peace to try the case, or of the \njudge of first instance to exercise his appellate jurisdiction. Not until after \njudgment had been rendered did the appellant, in her petition of February 21, \n1913, raise the question of constitutionality.<\/p>\n<p>In a case like the one at bar, where no question of lack of jurisdiction was \nraised either in the justice of the peace court or in the Court of First \nInstance, and where no objection was made to the jurisdiction of the justice of \nthe peace or of the judge of first instance in the exercise of his appellate \njurisdiction, if the latter is empowered and has original jurisdiction to try \nthe case by reason of the subject matter involved, a complaint brought before \nhim relative to the ownership of a parcel of real estate will be considered as \npresented for the first time and the judge of first instance will be deemed to \nhave taken cognizance of the case by reason of his original jurisdiction, \ninasmuch as during the trial no exception whatever was taken on the ground of \nlack of jurisdiction of the justice of the peace or of the judge of first \ninstance in his appellate jurisdiction. For these reasons the trial is \nunderstood to have been validly held in first instance. Consequently, an appeal \nfrom the judgment of the Court of First Instance would be proper and the Supreme \nCourt can decide such appeal in this second in stance. (Carroll and Ballesteros \n<em>vs.<\/em> Paredes, 17 Phil. Rep., 94.)<\/p>\n<p>In order that the said exception of lack of jurisdiction on the part of the \njustice of the peace or of the judge of first instance may be sustained, it is \nimperative that at least it be made at the hearing of the case in the Court of \nFirst Instance and prior to the rendition of judgment. If this requisite is \nomitted, no attention or consideration can be given to the exception upon the \nhearing of the appeal before the Supreme Court, for the reason of its having \nbeen taken out of season and dehors the trial by the Court of First Instance. \nSuch an important omission cannot be repaired by entering the exception after \njudgment has been pronounced, nor by alleging it as a ground for the appeal to \nthis court.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment \nappealed from have been refuted, the said judgment is held to be in accordance \nwith law and should be, as it is hereby, affirmed, with the costs against the \nappellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

From thence it was lost \non the journey. He denied that he lost the money in gambling but claimed that it \ndisappeared together with a bundle of his clothing while he was riding his horse \nas aforesaid.<\/p>\n<p>Appellant's counsel states in his brief:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The whole case hinges upon the question whether the story told by the \nwitness who says he saw the accused in the cockpit on April 20, and of the \nwitness who says the accused stated he lost the money 'in the game,' shall be \nbelieved, or whether the story of the defendant is accepted.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The trial court, in its decision upon which the judgment of conviction is \nbased, states that the defendant's \"explanation of the loss of the money is not \ncredible and that his acts in connection with the loss of same as alleged by him \nwere inconsistent with the theory of innocence.\" The trial court had all of the \nwitnesses before it and was, therefore, in some ways, in a better position to \njudge the relative value of their declarations than are we, who see merely the \ntypewritten questions and answers. There is nothing in the record which would \nintimate, much less demonstrate, that the court failed to take into \nconsideration some material fact or circumstance, or did not weigh accurately \nthe evidence presented, or failed to perform some duty to the accused laid upon \nhim by the law.<\/p>\n<p>While we are of the opinion that the judgment of conviction is well founded, \nit is our judgment that the court erred in imposing the maximum penalty. Abuse \nof confidence, which the learned trial court used as an aggravating circumstance \nin order to impose the maximum penalty, is one of the essential elements of the \ncrime charged and, therefore, cannot be used as an aggravating circumstance. The \nmedium degree of the penalty should have been imposed. <\/p>\n<p>The judgment of conviction is affirmed, it being understood that the criminal \npenalty imposed is four months and one day of <em>arresto mayor<\/em>.

It appears that the steampship \n<em>Islas Filipinas<\/em> arrived at the port of Manila from the foreign port of \nHongkong on or about April 15, 1912, and that she had on board 918 tins of \nprepared opium, weighing 210.87 kilos, which did not appear on the ship's \nmanifests. The estimated value of this opium in Manila was between P35,000 and \nP40,000. The steamer had on board other cargo than the above-mentioned opium, \nall of which was duly manifested as required by law, but that portion of her \ncargo consisting of 918 tins of opium was not manifested and did not appear upon \nany written or typewritten manifest of tthe cargo aboard said vessel.The \nsteamship Islas Filipinas was seized by the customs authorities for having on \nboard unmanifested contraband cargo in violation of the Customs Administrative \nAct; and at a hearing held at the custom house in Manila, at which one of her \nowners, together with his counsel, was present, the Insular Collector of \nCustoms, after hearing the evidence, imposed a fine of P1,000 upon the vessel \nunder the provisions of section 77 of Act No. 355. The facts touching the \ndiscovery and seizure of this unmanifested opium are set forth as follows in the \nbrief of the appellant:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The authorities having received information that there was opium on board \nthe boat, the customs officials and the owner of the steamer made a thorough \nsearch of the ship. The search resulted in finding 918 tins of prepared opium \nunder some cement in the bottom of a water tank at the bottom of the boat, and \none tin was found concealed under a table top in the dining room directly over \nthe manhole leading into the tank in which the 918 tins were found.<\/p>\n<p>\"An investigation was made by the owners and they discharged the captain and \nall other members of the crew whom they believed implicated.<\/p>\n<p>\"Mr. Fernandez' testimony on that point is as follows (bottom of p. 14, bill \nof exceptions) :<\/p>\n<p>\" 'Q. What, if anything, have you done in reference to the officers or \ncrew?\u2014A. We discharged the captain, after I was morally convinced that he had a \npart in it; I discharged one of the engineers and the supercargo, and I was \ngoing to discharge another officer, but he had already quit himself.'<\/p>\n<p>\"A criminal charge was also filed against Jose Artiaga, the captain of the \nship, and Cecilio Jimenez, another officer of the ship, charging them with the \ncrime of illegal importation of the opium mentioned. Said persons were duly \ntried, convicted and punished for said offense. (See case No. 8691, Court of \nFirst Instance, Manila.)<\/p>\n<p>\"There is no contention that the owners had any knowledge or were in any wise \nimplicated in this offense, and the testimony shows that the owners afforded \nevery help possible to search the ship, and gave the customs officials what \nlittle information they were able to gather from Mr. Fernandez' chauffeur, who \nwas on the ship on that trip. (See p. 16, bill of exceptions.) Not only had the \nowners no knowledge of the offense, but the officers, on putting this opium on \nboard, did so in violation of the instructions of the owners. (See testimony of \nRamon Fernandez, p. 14, bill of exceptions.)<\/p>\n<p>\"The captain was a trusted employee of the firm and it was a surprise to the \ncompany that this man should do such a thing. (See testimony of Ramon Fernandez, \np. 15, bill of exceptions.)<\/p>\n<p>\"The guilty parties were duly arrested, convicted, and punished. The owners \nthemselves did all they could to punish them by discharging \nthem.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the decision of this case the lower court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This is an appeal from an order of the Insular Collector of Customs imposing \na fine upon the appellant for violation of Act No. 355, section 77, as amended, \nwhich provides as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\" 'Every vessel from a foreign port or place must, under a penalty of not \nexceeding one thousand pesos for failure, have on board complete written or \ntypewritten manifests of <em>all her cargo.'<\/em><br\/><br\/>\"It is admitted that \nappellant's vessel did have on board 918 tins of opium which were not \nmanifested, but it is contended that these did not constitute cargo because they \nwere placed on board and concealed there without the knowledge of the owners. We \nfind no definition of the term 'cargo\/ however, which limits it to goods known \nto the owner. On the contrary, their knowledge is immaterial, and whatever the \nvessel is loaded with constitutes the cargo. In order to enforce the law, it \nbecomes necessary to hold the owners, regardless of their knowledge; any other \nrule would lead to all sorts of evasion and subterfuge, but the general rule, in \nmarine law is to make the vessel itself liable.<\/p>\n<p>\"Neither do we think it was incumbent upon the Collector to proceed against \nthe master of the vessel. It is true that he and another official have been \nprosecuted criminally, but that in no way bars the present proceeding. The \nsection above quoted imposes the liability 'on every vessel' and not upon the \nmaster of the vessel. This provision was strictly followed by the Acting \nCollector of Customs in his decision, for not only was the fine imposed upon the \nvessel, but its enforcement by seizure of the same was provided for.<\/p>\n<p>\"Finding no error in the decision of the Collector, we have no alternative \nbut to enforce the same.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In discussing the contentions of counsel for the appellant we adopt as our \nown the reasoning of the Solicitor General which is set forth in his brief on \nappeal substantially as follows:<\/p>\n<p>The appellant claims that the court erred (1) in holding that there was no \nerror in the decision of the Collector of Customs; (2) in not reversing the \ndecision of the Collector; (3) in holding that the steamer Islas Filipinas and \nthe owners are liable to a fine under section 303 of Act No. 355 for having on \nboard unmanifested cargo; (4) in holding that the facts set forth in the \ncomplaint are violations of section 77 of Act No. 355. In his brief, the counsel \nfor appellant says:<\/p>\n<p>\"We contend it is very unjust and morally wrong to punish or hold Fernandez \nHermanos liable or responsible for this criminal act of another, and that unless \nthere is a statute making the owner legally liable, this case should be \nreversed.\"<\/p>\n<p>The question of the propriety of subjecting the owners of a vessel to an \nadministrative fine for the violation of the customs-revenue laws is a matter \nfor legislative determination. The Philippine Legislature has adopted this \nmethod of punishment for the infraction of certain provisions of the Customs \nAdministrative Act. Far more stringent laws and regulations have been adopted \nelsewhere. (See 36 Cyc, 20-22.) By the general maritime law, vessels are made \nresponsible for the unlawful acts of their masters-and crews; and this extends \neven to forfeiture by positive Jaw. (Dobbin's Distillery vs. United States, 96 \nU. S., 395, 400.)<\/p>\n<p>In his work on Marine Insurance (7th ed., vol. 1, sec.250), Sir Joseph \nArnould says: \"A shipowner may become liable to pay large sums in consequence of \nloss of life, injury to person, or damage to property caused by the improper \nnavigation of his vessel.\"<\/p>\n<p>Whether this responsibility of the owners of vessels is based on the law of \nagency or on the theory that the vessel (res) is the guilty thing, is of no \nspecial importance. Experience has demonstrated that the application of such \npenalties is necessary for the purpose of protecting the revenues, and the lives \nand property intrusted to such common carriers. An able argument Which \ncompletely disposes of the alleged injustice and immorality of imposing this \nfine upon the appellant in this case is that delivered by Messrs. Ingersoll and \nBradford in Phile <em>vs.<\/em> The Anna (1 Dallas, U. S., 202), under a statute \nproviding for the forfeiture of the vessel, wherein it is said: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That the determination of this cause would certainly produce consequences of \nan important nature, and either render the act of assembly upon which it is \nfounded, a dead letter, or a productive instrument of public revenue. In \ngovernments differently constituted, where regal pageantry, or military force, \ncan invite or compel respect and obedience to the law, little danger is to be \napprehended from the occasional indulgence of learned men in their ingenious and \nnovel comments upon the sense and expressions of the legislature; but under a \ndemocratical constitution such as ours, should the people acquire a habit of \nyielding to logical subtleties and specious declamation, there is no power to \ncontrol the evil that must ensue; the principles of jurisprudence would become \nweak and fluctuating, and the virtue and dignity of the commonwealth would be \ncontaminated and eventually destroyed. Instead, therefore, of considering how to \nescape from the strong expression of the Act before us, it is our duty to give \nit the fullest operation that is necessary for suppressing the mischief to which \nthe legislative attention was originally directed; and here we cordially embrace \nthe position of our antagonists, that the meaning of those who framed the law is \nthe best guide to direct us in carrying it into execution. What then was the \nevil complained of, at the time that this act was made? The atrocious frauds \ncommitted upon the revenue. What was the remedy provided? It could not be merely \nthe forfeiture of the smuggled goods, as the claimants insinuate, for that was \nimposed by an antecedent law; but the truth is, that every other penalty having \nproved ineffectual, this statute was enacted expressly to superadd the \nforfeiture of the vessel or boat from which the goods should be clandestinely \nunladed.\"'<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In that case the court held that under the law the vessel in question was \nliable to forfeiture in case the goods were unladen from her before due entry, \nwhether the owners were privy to the transaction or otherwise. In his charge to \nthe jury the president of the court said: \"This has been repeatedly called a \nhard law; but the truth is, that revenue laws are. of a harsher nature than any \nothers, and necessarily so; for, the devices of ingenious men render it \nindispensable for the legislature to meet their illicit practices with severer \npenalties.\"<\/p>\n<p>The appellant's contention that the provisions of section 77 of Act No. 355 \napply only to cases where a vessel does not have a manifest on board, and, that \nsection 303 of said Act is applicable in cases in which a vessel has on board \ncargo not included in her manifests, is not well founded. Section 303 imposes \ncertain duties upon the master of a vessel in connection with the administration \nof the customs regulations; and provides penalties in case of failure to perform \nthem; and the vessel or its owners are not made responsible except as provided \nin section 343 of the Act. Section 77 imposes the absolute obligation, under \npenalty for failure, upon every vessel from a foreign port to have \"on board \ncomplete written or typewritten manifests of all her cargo, signed by the \nmaster.\" Where the law requires a manifest to be kept or delivered, it is not \ncomplied with unless the manifest is <em>true and accurate.<\/em> (See Phile \n<em>vs.<\/em> The Anna, <em>supra.<\/em>)<\/p>\n<p>Another contention of the appellant is that the opium in question is not \n\"cargo\" within the meaning of the custom laws. The term \"cargo\" is not \nspecifically defined in the Customs Administrative Act, but from the language \nused in several of its provisions it is clear that the word \"cargo\" as used in \nthe section under consideration includes all goods, wares, and merchandise \naboard ship which do not form part of the ship's stores.<\/p>\n<p><br\/>Black's Law Dictionary defines the term \"cargo\" as follows : \"The load or \nlading of a vessel; goods and merchandise put on board a ship to be carried to a \ncertain port.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The lading or freight of a ship; the goods, merchandise, or whatever is \nconveyed in a ship or other merchant vessel. (See 1 Mason, 142; 4 Pick., 429; 9 \nMete. (Mass.), 366; 103 Mass., 406.)<\/p>\n<p>\"A cargo is the loading of a ship or other vessel, the bulk of which is to be \nascertained from the capacity of the ship or vessel. The word embraces all that \nthe vessel is capable of carrying. (3 Rob. (N. Y.), 173.) The term may be \napplied in such a sense as to include passengers, as well as freight, but in a \ntechnical sense it designates goods only.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The following definitions of the word \"cargo\" are found in the cases:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The word 'cargo' <em>ex vi termini,<\/em> means the goods on board of the \nvessel.\" (Seamans <em>vs.<\/em> Loring (U. S.), 21 Fed. Cas., 920, 924.)<\/p>\n<p>\"A cargo is the lading of a ship or other vessel, the bulk or dimension of \nwhich is to be ascertained from the capacity of the ship or vessel; and, where \nthe name of the ship or vessel is in the contract, her capacity for carrying or \nthe bulk of her cargo need not be stated for the word 'cargo' embraces all that \nthe vessel is capable of carrying.\" (Flanagan <em>vs.<\/em> Demarest, 26 N. Y. \nSup. Ct. (3 Rob.), 173, 181.)<\/p>\n<p>\"The cargo is the lading of the vessel, and, though by bribery or craft, some \narticles might be introduced in the hold, without the knowledge of the owners or \nthe captain, yet everything which is put on board the vessel is, in general, \ncomprehended in that description.\" (Phile vs. The Anna, 1 Dallas (U.S.), \n202.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The present case raises a question of great importance to the practical and \nsuccessful working of the Customs Administrative Act, and its decision will \ndetermine whether section 77 of said Act is to be given force and effect and is \nto have any real value as a provision designed to prevent frauds upon the public \nrevenues. If the owners of vessels were allowed to escape the penalty provided \nfor this fraud or attempt to defraud the revenues by setting up pleas of \ninnocence and ignorance, it is clear that the legislative intention would be \ndefeated. As was said in the case of Phile <em>vs.<\/em> The Anna \n(<em>supra<\/em>):<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Then, there remains only the great point upon which the counsel for the \nclaimants seem chiefly to rely, to wit, their innocence and ignorance with \nrespect to the fraud that has been committed,. There is no evidence, indeed, \nthat tends to show that the owners of the ship meant to do anything unfairly; \nbut, on the contrary, that the mate brought the goods hither with the avowed \nintention to defraud them as well as the State. The question then recurs, what \ndifference does it make, whether they knew of it or not? Here is a positive law \nthat directs a due entry of all goods, wares, and merchandise imported into this \nState, under certain penalties, and one of them is the forfeiture of the vessel \nor boat from which they are unladed. It does not speak of the knowledge of any \nperson, but seems to be studiously Worded to avoid that construction. It is not \na novel law, though perhaps it is stricter now than formerly; for, in England, \nit has long existed, and before the Revolution it was known in Pennsylvania. The \nlegislature has thought that nothing else would answer, and the judges and the \njurors are equally bound to obedience. If, indeed, the law was doubtful or \nlatitudinal, admitting one interpretation, which would be just, and another \nwhich would be unjust, it would become us to prefer the former. But if the \npolicy of the legislature seems to bear hard on the subject, we are not to judge \nand determine upon its propriety (that is a matter for the deliberation of those \nwho made the law), and however unjust it seems, we must acquiesce, or there must \nbe a dissolution of society. It must certainly affect every humane man to see \nthe innocent suffer; but in society this is not strange or uncommon; and the \ndistinction may properly be taken between criminal and civil cases. The law \nnever punishes any man criminally but for his own act, yet it frequently \npunishes him in his pocket for the act of another.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The judgment entered in the lower court should be and is hereby affirmed, \nwith the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

(Sgd.) A. G. Serrano.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The first question for resolution on this appeal is whether or not, under the \nNegotiable Instruments Law, an indorser of a negotiable promissory note may, in \nan action brought by his indorsee, show, by parol evidence, that the indorsement \nwas wholly without consideration and that, in making it, the indorser acted as \nagent for the indorsee, as a mere vehicle of transfer of the naked title from \nthe maker to the indorsee, for which he received no consideration whatever.<\/p>\n<p>The learned trial court, although it received parol evidence on the subject \nprovisionally, held, on the final decision of the case, that such evidence was \nnot admissible to alter, vary, modify or contradict the terms of the contract of \nindorsement, and, therefore, refused to consider the evidence thus provisionally \nreceived, which tended to show that, by verbal agreement between the indorser \nand the indorsee, the indorser, in making the indorsement, was acting as agent \nfor the indorsee, as a mere vehicle for the transference of naked title, and \nthat his indorsement was wholly without consideration. The court also held that \nit was immaterial whether there was a consideration for the transfer or not, as \nthe indorser, under the evidence offered, was an accommodation indorser.<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the trial court erred in both findings.<\/p>\n<p>In the first place, the consideration of a negotiable promissory note, or of \nany of the contracts connected therewith, like that of any other written \ninstrument, is, between the immediate parties to the contract, open to attack, \nunder proper circumstances, for the purpose of showing an absolute lack or \nfailure of consideration.<\/p>\n<p>It seems, according to the parol evidence provisionally admitted on the \ntrial, that the defendant was a broker doing business in the city of Manila and \nthat part of his business consisted in looking up and ascertaining persons who \nhad money to loan as well as those who desired to borrow money and, acting as a \nmediary, negotiate a loan between the two. He had done much business with the \nplaintiff and the borrower, as well as with many other people in the city of \nManila, prior to the matter which is the basis of this action, and was well \nknown to the parties interested. According to his custom in transactions of this \nkind, and the arrangement made in this particular case, the broker obtained \ncompensation for his services of the borrower, the lender paying nothing1 \ntherefor. Sometimes this was a certain per cent of the sum loaned; at other \ntimes it was a part of the interest which the borrower was to pay, the latter \npaying 1 1\/2 per cent per month for the use of the money, the lender taking 1 \nper cent and the broker 1\/2 per cent. According to the method usually followed \nin these transactions, and the procedure in this particular case, the broker \ndelivered the money personally to the borrower, took the note in his own name \nand immediately transferred it by indorsement to the lender. In the case at bar \nthis was done at the special request of the indorsee and simply as a favor to \nhim, the latter stating to the broker that he did not wish his name to appear on \nthe books of the borrowing company as a lender of money and that he desired that \nthe broker take the note in his own name, immediately transferring to him title \nthereto by indorsement. This was done, the note being <em>at<\/em> <em>once<\/em> \ntransferred to the lender.<\/p>\n<p>According to the evidence referred to, there never was a moment when Serrano \nwas the real owner of the note. It was always the note of the indorsee, Maulini, \nhe having furnished the money which was the consideration for the note directly \nto the maker and being the only person who had the slightest interest therein, \nSerrano, the broker, acting solely as an agent, a vehicle by which the naked \ntitle to the note passed from the borrower to the lender. The only payment that \nthe broker received was for his services <em>in negotiating the loan.<\/em> He \nwas paid absolutely nothing for becoming responsible as an indorser on the \npaper, nor did the indorsee lose, pay or forego anything, or alter \nhis<br\/>position thereby.<\/p>\n<p>Nor was the defendant an accommodation indorser. The learned trial court \nquoted that provision of the Negotiable Instruments Law which defines an \naccommodation party as \"one who has signed the intrument as maker, drawer, \nacceptor, or indorser, without receiving value therefor, and for the purpose of \n<em>lending his name to some other person.<\/em>Such a person is liable on the \ninstrument to a holder for value, notwithstanding such holder at the time of \ntaking the instrument knew the same to be only an accommodation party.\" (Act No. \n2031, sec. 29.)<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the trial court misunderstood this definition. The \naccommodation to which reference is made in the section quoted is not one to the \nperson who takes the note\u2014that is, the payee or indorsee, but one to the maker \nor indorser of the note. It is true that in the case at bar it was an \naccommodation to the plaintiff, in a popular sense, to have the defendant \nindorse the note; but it was not the accommodation described in the law, but, \nrather, a mere favor to him and one which in no way bound Serrano. In cases of \naccommodation indorsement the indorser makes the indorsement for the \naccommodation of the maker. Such an indorsement is generally for the purpose of \nbetter securing the payment of the note\u2014that is, he lends his name to the maker, \nnot to the holder. Cutting it in another way: An accommodation note is one to \nwhich the accommodation party has put his name, without consideration, for the \npurpose of accommodating some other party who is to use it and is expected to \npay it. The credit given to the accommodation party is sufficient consideration \nto bind the accommodation maker. Where, however, an indorsement is made as a \nfavor to the indorsee, who requests it, not the better to secure payment, but to \nrelieve himself from a distasteful situation, and where the only consideration \nfor such indorsement passes from the indorser to the indorsee, the situation \ndoes not present one creating an accomodation indorsement, nor one where there \nis a consideration sufficient to sustain an action on the indorsement.<\/p>\n<p>The prohibition in section 285 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not apply \nto a case like the one before us. The purpose of that prohibition is to prevent \nalteration, change, modification or contradiction of the <em>terms<\/em> of a \nwritten instrument, admittedly existing, by the use of parol evidence, except in \nthe cases specifically named in the section. The case at bar is not one where \nthe evidence offered varies, alters, modifies or contradicts the <em>terms<\/em> \nof the contract of indorsement admittedly existing. The evidence was not offered \nfor that purpose. The purpose was to show that no contract of indorsement ever \nexisted; that the minds of the parties never met on the terms of such a \ncontract; that they never mutually agreed to enter into such a contract; and \nthat there never existed a consideration upon which such an agreement could be \nfounded. The evidence was not offered to vary, alter, modify, or contradict the \nterms of an agreement which it is admitted existed between the parties, but to \n<em>deny that there ever existed any agreement whatever;<\/em> to wipe out all \napparent relations between the parties, and not to vary, alter or contradict the \nterms of a relation admittedly existing; in other words, the purpose of the \nparol evidence was to demonstrate, not that the indorser did not intend to make \nthe <em>particular<\/em> indorsement which he did make; not that he did not \nintend to make the indorsement in the terms made; but, rather, to deny the \nreality of any indorsement; that a relation of <em>any kind whatever<\/em> was \n<em>created or existed between him and the indorsee<\/em> by reason of the \nwriting on the back of the instrument; that no consideration ever passed to \nsustain an indorsement of any kind whatsoever.<\/p>\n<p>The contention has some of the appearances of a case in which an indorser \nseeks to prove forgery. Where an indorser claims that his name was forged, it is \nclear that parol evidence is admissible to prove that fact, and, if he proves \nit, it is a complete defense, the fact being that the indorser never made any \nsuch contract, that no such relation ever existed between him and the indorsee, \nand that there was no consideration whatever to sustain such a contract. In the \ncase before us we have a condition somewhat similar. While the indorser does not \nclaim that his name was forged, he does claim that it was obtained from him in a \nmanner which, between the parties themselves, renders the contract as completely \ninoperative as if it had been forged.<\/p>\n<p>Parol evidence was admissible for the purposes named. There is no \ncontradiction of the evidence offered by the defense and received provisionally \nby the court. Accepting it as true the judgment must be reversed.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed and the complaint dismissed on the \nmerits; no special finding as to costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Johnson<\/em> and <em>Trent, JJ.,<\/em> concur. \n<\/p><p><strong>TORRES, J.<\/strong>, with whom concurs ARAULLO, J.<\/p>\n<p>Act No. 2031, known as the Negotiable Instruments Law, which governs the \npresent case, establishes various kinds of indorsements by means of which the \nliability of the indorser is in some manner limited, distinguishing it from that \nof the regular or general indorser, and among those kinds is that of the \nqualified indorsement which, pursuant to section 38 of the same Act, constitutes \nthe indorser a mere assignor of the title to the instrument, and may be made by \nadding to the indorser's signature the words \"without recourse\" or any words of \nsimilar import.<\/p>\n<p>If the defendant, Antonio G. Serrano, intervened, as he alleged and tried to \nprove that he did at the trial, only as a broker or agent between the lender and \nplaintiff, Maulini, and the makers of the promissory note, Padern, Moreno &amp; \nCo. and Angel Gimenez, in order to afford an opportunity to the former to invest \nthe amount of the note in such manner that it might bring him interest, the \ndefendant could have qualified the indorsement in question by adding to his \nsignature the words \"without recourse\" or any others' such as would have made \nknown in what capacity he intervened in that transaction. As the defendant did \nnot do so and as he signed the indorsement in favor of the plaintiff Maulini for \nvalue received from the latter, his liability, according to section 66 of the \nAct aforecited, is that of a regular or general indorser, who, this same section \nprovides, engages that if the instrument be dishonored, and the necessary \nproceedings on dishonor be duly taken, he will pay the amount thereof to the \nholder, or to any subsequent indorser who may be compelled to pay it. And the \nevidence which the defendant presented, tending to show what were the conditions \nto which he obligated himself and in what capacity he intervened in making that \nindorsement and that this latter was absolutely without consideration, should \nnot have been admitted so that he might elude the aforesaid obligation, or, if \nadmitted, should not be taken into account, because as a regular indorser he \nwarranted, pursuant to the said section 66, that the instrument was genuine and \nin all respects what it purported to be, that he had a good title to it, and \nthat it was at the time of his indorsement valid and subsisting. He cannot, \ntherefore, by means of any evidence, and much less of such as consists of his \nown testimony, and as such interested party, alter, modify, contradict or annul, \nas he virtually claimed and claims to be entitled to do, what in writing and \nwith a full and perfect knowledge of the meaning and import of the words \ncontained in the indorse ment, he set forth therein over his signature.<\/p>\n<p>Section 63 of the Act above cited says that a person placing his signature \nupon an instrument otherwise than as maker, drawer, or acceptor is deemed to be \nan indorser, unless he clearly indicates by appropriate words his intention to \nbe bound in some other capacity. This provision of the law clearly indicates \nthat in every negotiable instrument it is absolutely necessary to specify the \ncapacity in which the person intervenes who is mentioned therein or takes part \nin its negotiation, because only by so doing can it be determined what \nliabilities arise from that intervention and from whom, how and when they must \nbe exacted. And if, in the event of a failure to express the capacity in which \nthe person who signed the negotiable instrument intended to be bound, he should \nbe deemed to be an indorser, when the very words of the instrument expressly and \nconclusively show that such he is, as occurs in the present case, and when the \nindorsement contains no restriction, modification, condition or qualification \nwhatever, there cannot be attributed to him, without violating the provisions of \nthe said Act, any other intention than that of being bound in the capacity in \nwhich he appears in the instrument itself, nor can evidence be admitted or, if \nalready admitted, taken into consideration, for the purpose of proving such \nother intention, for the simple reason that if the law has already fixed and \ndetermined the capacity in which it must be considered that the person who \nsigned the negotiable instrument intervened and the intention of his being bound \nin a definite capacity, for no other purpose, undoubtedly, than that there shall \nbe no evidence given in the matter, when that capacity appears in the instrument \nitself and the intention is determined by the very same capacity, as occurs in \nthis case, the admission of evidence in reference thereto is entirely \nunnecessary, useless, and contrary to the purposes of the law, which is clear \nand precise in its provisions and admits of no subterfuges or evasions for \nescaping obligations contracted upon the basis of credit, with evident and sure \ndetriment to those who intervened or took part in the negotiation of the \ninstrument.<\/p>\n<p>However, it is held in the majority opinion, for the purpose of sustaining \nthe premise that the proofs presented by the defendant could have been admitted \nwithout violating the provisions of section 285 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \nthat the evidence was not offered to vary, alter, modify, or contradict the \nterms of an agreement <em>which it is admitted existed between the parties, but \nto deny that there ever existed any agreement whatever; <\/em>to wipe out all \napparent relations between the parties, and not to vary, alter or contradict the \nterms of a relation admittedly existing; in other words, the purpose of the \nparol evidence was to demonstrate, not that the indorser did not intend to make \nthe <em>particular<\/em> indorsement which he did, not that he did not intend to \nmake the indorsement in the terms made, but rather to deny the reality of \n<em>any<\/em> indorsement; to deny that a relation of <em>any kind whatsoever \n<\/em>was<em> created<\/em> <em>or existed between him and the indorsee<\/em> by \nreason of the writing on the back of the instrument; to deny that any \nconsideration ever passed to sustain an indorsement of any kind whatsoever. It \nis stated in the same decision that the contention has some of the appearances \nof a case in which an indorser seeks to prove forgery.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, we do not see that there exists any appearance or similarity \nwhatever between the case at bar and one where forgery is sought to be proved. \nThe defendant did not, either civilly or criminally, impugn the indorsement as \nbeing false. He admitted its existence, as stated in the majority opinion \nitself, and did not disown his signature written in the indorsement. His denial \nto the effect that the indorsement was wholly without consideration, aside from \nthe fact that it is in contradiction to the statements that he over his \nsignature made in the instrument, does not allow the supposition that the \ninstrument was forged.<\/p>\n<p>The meaning which the majority opinion apparently wishes to convey, in \ncalling attention to the difference between what, as it says, was the purpose of \nthe evidence presented by the defendant and what was sought to be proved \nthereby, is that the defendant does not endeavor to contradict or alter the \nterms of the agreement, which is contained in the instrument and is admitted to \nexist between the parties; but to deny the existence of such an agreement \nbetween them, that is, the existence of any indorsement at all, and that any \nconsideration ever passed to sustain the said indorsement, or, in other words, \nthat the defendant acknowledged the indorsement as regards the form in which it \nappears to have been drawn up, but not with respect to its essence, that is, to \nthe truth of the particular facts set forth in the indorsement. It cannot be \ndenied that the practical result of such evidence is other than to contradict, \nmodify, alter or even to annul the terms of the agreement contained in the \nindorsement: so that, in reality, the distinction does not exist that is \nmentioned as a ground of the decision of the majority of the court in support of \nthe opinion that the evidence in question might have been admitted, without \nviolating the provisions of the aforementioned section 285 of the Code of Civil \nProcedure. This section is based upon the same principle which is taken into \naccount in the Negotiable Instruments Law to write into it such positive and \ndefinite provisions which purport, without possibility of discussion or doubt, \nthe uselessness of taking evidence when the capacity of the person who \nintervened in a negotiable instrument or his intention of being bound in a \nparticular way appears in the instrument itself or has been fixed by statute, if \nit is not shown that he did so in some other capacity than that of maker, drawer \nor acceptor.<\/p>\n<p>But, aside from what the Code of Civil Procedure prescribes with respect to \nthis matter, as the present case is governed by the Negotiable Instruments Law, \nwe must abide by its provisions.<\/p>\n<p>Section 24 of this Act, No. 2031, says that every negotiable instrument is \ndeemed <em>prima facie<\/em> to have been issued for a valuable consideration; \nand every person whose signature appears thereon, to have become a party thereto \nfor value. If the Act establishes this presumption for the case where there \nmight be doubt with respect to the existence of a valuable consideration, in \norder to avoid the taking of evidence in the matter, when the consideration \nappears from the instrument itself by the expression of the value, the \nintroduction of evidence is entirely unnecessary and improper.<\/p>\n<p>According to section 25 of the same Act, value is any consideration \nsufficient to support a simple contract, and so broad is the scope the law gives \nto the meaning of \"value\" in this kind of instruments that it considers as such \na prior or preexistent debt, whether the instrument be payable on demand or at \nsome future date.<\/p>\n<p>Section 26 provides that where value has at any time been given for the \ninstrument, the holder is deemed a holder for value in respect to all parties \nwho became such prior to that time. It is unquestionable that the defendant gave \nthe P3,000 for the instrument, and, for the purpose of the plaintiff's being \nconsidered a holder for value, both in respect to the maker and to the defendant \nindorser, it is immaterial whether he did so directly to the person who appears \nin the promissory note as the maker or whether he delivered the sum to the \ndefendant in order that this latter might in turn, deliver it to the maker.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant being\" the holder of the instrument, he is also unquestionably \nthe holder in due course. In the first place, in order to avoid doubts with \nrespect to this matter, which might require the introduction of evidence, the \nAct before mentioned has provided, in section 59, that every holder is deemed \n<em>prima facie<\/em> to be a holder in due course, and such is the weight it \ngives to this presumption and to the consequences derived therefrom, that it \nimposes upon the holder the burden to prove that he or some person under whom he \nclaims acquired the title in due course, only when it is shown that the title of \nany person who has negotiated the instrument was defective. This rule, however, \npursuant to the said section, does not apply in favor of a party who became \nbound on the instrument prior to the acquisition of such defective title, in \nwhich case the defendant Serrano is not included, because, in the first place, \nhe was not bound on the instrument prior to the acquisition of the title by the \nplaintiff, but it was the maker of the promissory note who was bound on the \ninstrument executed in favor of the defendant or indorser prior to the \nacquisition of the title by the plaintiff; and, in the second place, it does not \nappear, nor was it proved, as will be seen hereinafter, that the title in \nquestion was defective.<\/p>\n<p>According to section 52 of the same Act, the plaintiff is the holder in due \ncourse of the instrument in question, that is, of the promissory note containing \nthe obligation compliance with which is demanded of him by the defendant, \nbecause he took the instrument under the conditions: (<em>a<\/em>) That it was \ncomplete and regular upon its face; (<em>b<\/em>) that he became the holder of it \nbefore it was overdue, and without notice that it had been previously \ndishonored; (<em>c<\/em>) that he took it in good faith and for value; and \n(<em>d<\/em>) that at the time it was negotiated to hini he had no notice of any \ndeficiency in the instrument or defect in the title of the person negotiating \nit.<\/p>\n<p>Pursuant to section 56 of the said Act, to constitute notice of a deficiency \nin the instrument or defect in the title of the person negotiating,the same, the \nperson to whom it is transferred must have had actual knowledge of the \ndeficiency or defect, or knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the \ninstrument amounted to bad faith.<\/p>\n<p>In the present case it cannot be said, for it is not proven, that the \nplaintiff, upon accepting the instrument from the defendant, had actual \nknowledge of any deficiency or defect in the same, for the simple reason that it \ncontains no deficiency or defect. Its terms are very clear and positive. There \nis nothing ambiguous, concealed, or which might give rise to any doubt whatever \nwith respect to its terms or to the agreement made by the parties. Furthermore, \nas stated in the majority opinion, the defendant did not intend to make the \nparticular indorsement which he did make in the terms, form and manner in which \nit was made, nor did he intend to change or alter the terms of the agreement \nwhich is admitted to have existed between the parties. All of which indicates \nthat, neither as regards the plaintiff nor as regards the defendant, was there \nany deficiency or defect in the title or in the instrument, and that the \nplaintiff, upon taking or receiving the instrument from the defendant, had no \nknowledge of any fact from which bad faith on his part might be implied. \nBesides, no evidence was produced of the existence of any such bad faith, nor of \nthe knowledge of any deficiency or defect.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, section 55 of Act No. 2031 provides that the title of a person who \nnegotiates an instrument is defective within the meaning of this Act when he \nobtained the instrument, or any signature thereto, by fraud, duress, or force \nand fear, or other unlawful means, or for an illegal consideration, or when he \nnegotiates it in breach of faith, or under such circumstances as amount to a \nfraud. As no evidence was taken on these points, the only ones that may be \nproven as regards negotiable instruments, the defendant must be deemed to be the \nholder of the instrument in due course, pursuant to the provisions of the \naforecited section 59, and he cannot be required to prove that he or his \npredecessor in interest acquired the title as such holder in due course.<\/p>\n<p>Now then, according to section 28 of the same Act, as against the holder of \nthe instrument in due course absence or failure of consideration is not a matter \nof defense; and, pursuant to section 57, a holder in due course holds the \ninstrument free from any defect of title of prior parties, and free from \ndefenses available to prior parties among themselves, and may enforce payment of \nthe instrument for the full amount thereof against all parties liable thereon. \nAnd the next section, No. 58 prescribes that in the hands of any holder other \nthan a holder in due course, a negotiable instrument is subject to the same \ndefenses as if it were nonnegotiable.<\/p>\n<p>So it could not be clearer than that, pursuant to the provisions of the \nNegotiable Instruments Law, which governs the case at bar, as the plaintiff is \nthe holder in due course of the instrument in question, no proof whatever from \nthe defendant could be admitted, nor if admitted should be taken into account, \nbearing on the lack of consideration in the indorsement, as alleged by him, and \nfor the purpose of denying the existence of any indorsement and that any \nrelation whatever was created or existed between him and the indorsee; likewise, \nthat no defenses of any kind could have been admitted from the defendant in \nrespect to the said instrument, and, finally, that the defendant is obligated to \npay the sum mentioned in the said indorsement, it being immaterial whether or \nnot he be deemed to be an accommodation party in the instrument, in order that \ncompliance with the said obligation may be required of him in his capacity of \nindorser.<\/p>\n<p>Basing our conclusions on the foregoing grounds, and regretting to dissent \nfrom the opinion of the majority of our colleagues, we believe that the judgment \nappealed from should be affirmed, with the costs against the appellant. <\/p>\n<p><br\/><\/p><\/div>",

The plaintiff therefore asked \nthe court to annul the partition made by her with the defendants, on January 10, \n1912, of the property of the deceased Sulpicio de Torres, and to order the said \ndefendants to restore to the plaintiff all the lands received by them through \nthe aforementioned instrument of partition.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants entered a general denial of all the facts contained in the \ncomplaint and, as a special defense, alleged that all the lands adjudicated to \nthe three defendants, in accordance with the agreement referred to by the \nplaintiff in her complaint, were acquired by the defendant Mariano Obispo from \nthe Spanish Government, through a composition title issued on March 27, 1888, \nand recorded in the property registry of Tayabas, and therefore prayed that, as \nthese lands belonged exclusively to the defendant Mariano Obispo, they be \nabsolved from the complaint, with the costs upon the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>This suit is brought to annul the partition of certain hereditary property, \neffected by the plaintiff, Valentina de Torres, on the one hand, and her uncle \nNarciso de Torres, a brother of her deceased father, Sulpicio de Torres, and \ntheir nephews, Mariano Obispo and Cesareo Rabina, on the other. The property \nthat was the subject of the partition came from the plaintiff's father.<\/p>\n<p>The said partition was set forth on page 4 of the document, Exhibit A, \nwritten in Tagalog and ratified before a notary, and its translation appears on \npage 6 of the same. Pursuant to the stipulations of this instrument it was \ncovenanted between the four parties aforementioned that the land left by the \nplaintiff's deceased father at his death should be divided into as many parcels \nand one parcel be allotted to each of them.<\/p>\n<p>To substantiate her claim, plaintiff exhibited (p. 30, Exhibit B) a private \ndocument subscribed on December 19, 1911, by Sulpicio de Torres, wherein the \nlatter stated, under oath and in the presence of witnesses, that when he was \nstill young and single he had a natural daughter named Valentina Villoria, whom, \nby virtue of articles 130 and 131 of the Civil Code and with her consent, she \nalso having signed the document, he recognized as such natural daughter of his \nand authorized her to bear his surname, in accordance with article 133 of the \ncode. This document was ratified before a notary public on December 20th of the \nSame year.<\/p>\n<p>During the hearing of this case in the Court of First Instance, the \nplaintiff, Valentina de Torres, after affirming under oath in the presence of \ndefendants' counsel that she was the natural daughter of Sulpicio de Torres by \nher mother, also single, added that her parents subsequently married and had two \nother children who died in infancy; that her father left the property specified \nin the document of partition, Exhibit A, which she signed because, upon her \nrefusal at first to do so, her aforesaid relatives became angry at her and told \nher that as a natural daughter she was not entitled to any share in her father's \nestate, and that, believing such statement to be true, she signed the said \ndocument, although she did not afterwards come into possession of the parcel of \nland allotted to her in the partition on account of the opposition set up \nagainst her. She further testified that she had not at the time consulted any \nattorney, and that her mother was still living, being now very old and feeble, \nand bore the surname of Villoria. During the course of the hearing counsel for \ndefendants stated that he waived his right to present evidence in the name of \nhis clients, inasmuch as it was his understanding that the question at issue was \npurely one of law and not of fact, and asked that the defendants be absolved \nfrom the complaint, with the costs upon the plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiff was born a natural daughter of Sulpicio de Torres, who was \nsingle at the time of her birth and had her by a woman who was then also single. \nThese parents subsequently married and by reason thereof the plaintiff came into \nthe enjoyment of the same rights that pertained to her parents' two other \nlegitimate children, born in wedlock. (Civil Code, art. 122.)<\/p>\n<p>The defendants' attorney was present when the plaintiff, Valentina de Torres, \ntestified under oath during the hearing of the case in the Court of First \nInstance that her parents were married after her births and he neither \ncontradicted nor denied this statement, and therefore it must be accepted as \ntrue and the plaintiff must be considered as the legitimized natural daughter of \nher parents who begot her while they were still single and qualified to contract \nmarriage.<\/p>\n<p>Though the plaintiff were only a natural daughter, she alone would be \nentitled to succeed to the estate of her natural father, according to article \n939 of the Civil Code, in as much as she was recognized by her father and he had \nno other legitimate descendant or ascendant; however, this does not apply to the \npresent case, because it concerns a natural daughter legitimized by a subsequent \nmarriage.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to the unfounded and erroneous claim made by the brother and \nnephews of the plaintiff's deceased father to the estate left by the latter, it \nmust be borne in mind that article 921 of the same code prescribes that \"in \ninheritances the relative nearest in degree excludes the most remote excepting \nthe right of representation in proper cases,\" and in the case at bar such a \nright of representation cannot be invoked by the defendants.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from the fact that the plaintiff, a woman without education and \nculture, allowed herself to be convinced, and seriously believed what the \ndefendants told her, to wit, that as a natural daughter of her father she was \nnot entitled to succeed to his estate and that she merely could share the \nhereditary property with them, consideration must be given to the provision of \narticle 1081 of the Civil Code, which specifically prescribes that \"a division \nmade with a person who was believed to be an heir without being so shall be \nvoid.\" The woman Valentina de Torres, being ignorant and not so well informed as \nthe defendants, erroneously believed that these latter were entitled to inherit \nfrom her father, when in fact while she is living she alone is entitled under \nthe law to succeed to the estate of Sulpicio de Torres, to the exclusion of all \nher other relatives in remote degree.<\/p>\n<p>On this premise, the plaintiff is entitled to enter upon the possession of \nthe property of which the estate of her deceased father consists, and her \nrelatives who took charge of the same unduly and without any right whatever, \nthrough a partition that was null and void, must return or restore it to the \nplaintiff, its lawful owner.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby it is held that the errors assigned to the \njudgment appealed from have been refuted, and this latter being in accord with \njustice and in harmony with the merits of the case, we should, and do hereby, \naffirm the same, with the costs against the appellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

MONICO CUSTAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I SI O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The appellant was convicted in the court below of a violation of the Election \nLaw, in that he took the elector's prescribed by the general Election Law, on \nthe 3d day of May, 1912, although at that time he was delinquent in the payment \nof his taxes in the sum of P1.23. Upon conviction a fine of P200 was imposed by \nthe trial judge.\n<p>In the court below the accused substantially admitted the truth of the \nallegations in the information, but claimed that he took this oath without \nunderstanding the requirements of the Election Law, and that the reason for his \ndelinquency was that he was awaiting advices from the municipal treasurer as to \nthe amount due by him. It appears that he paid the taxes in question on June 29, \n1912, nearly two months after the date when he took the prescribed election \noath.<\/p>\n<p>The insufficiency of general defenses and excuses of this nature upon charges \nof violations of the Election Law, when unsupported by the most convincing \nevidence, was discussed at length in the cases of United States <em>vs.<\/em> \nEstavillo (19 Phil, Rep., 478); and United States <em>vs.<\/em> Tabuyo (19 Phil. \nRep., 501).<\/p>\n<p>On appeal, counsel contends that the judgment of conviction should be \nreversed, because, as he alleges:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"1. The defendant was not properly identified in the court below.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. The arraignment of the accused was not had in accordance with the \npertinent provisions of General Orders No. 58. <\/p>\n<p>\"3. The record does not disclose that the accused was provided with counsel, \nnor that he was informed as to his right to have counsel.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Upon the first point it is sufficient to say that the answer of the defendant \nduring his, examination at the trial impliedly admitted his identity as the \nperson described in the information.<\/p>\n<p>The second contention: is, we think, disposed of by the mere reading of the \nrecord itself. It appears that at the opening of the trial, the presiding judge \naddressed the following question to the accused:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. You are accused of having taken an oath when you were delinquent in the \npayment of your taxes,\"\u2014which the accused answered as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\"A. I do not wish to plead 'not guilty' nor 'guilty.' I wish to tell the \ncourt something.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This was followed by a statement by the accused as to his reasons for failing \nto pay the taxes mentioned in the information, and as to his alleged ignorance \nof the nature and effect of the oath taken by him.<\/p>\n<p>We think that in the absence of affirmative evidence to the contrary, this \nentry in the record justifies us in holding that the accused was in fact \narraigned, and given an opportunity to plead to the information. It may be that \nthere was hot a strict compliance with the provisions of the statute in this \nregard. But even if this were so, we think that it is clear that there was a \nsubstantial compliance with those provisions: and it affirmatively appearing \nfrom the record that the accused was fully advised as to the nature of the \ncharge against him, was given an opportunity to plead to the charge, and \nthereafter adopted the course which accorded best with the nature of his \ndefense, we are unable to say that his substantial rights were prejudiced by any \ninformality which may have crept into the proceedings. We conclude therefore \nthat if there was error in the proceedings at this stage of the trial, it was at \nmost error without prejudice, and as such not sufficient to justify a reversal \nof the judgment entered in the court below.<\/p>\n<p>The contentions of counsel, based upon the fact that the accused appears to \nhave gone to trial without counsel and the failure of the record to disclose \naffirmatively that the accused was formally advised of his right to have \ncounsel, were discussed at length and decided adversely in the case of United \nStates <em>vs.<\/em> Labial and Abuso (27 Phil. Rep., 82), citing the cases of \nUnited States <em>vs.<\/em> Ramirez and Seradoy (26 Phil. Rep., 616), United \nStates <em>vs.<\/em> Go-Lerig (21 Phil. Rep., 426), and a considerable number of \nAmerican authorities.<\/p>\n<p>But while we decline to reverse the judgment entered in the case at bar on \nthe ground of alleged irregularities in the proceedings which do not appear to \nhave prejudiced the substantial rights of the accused, we do not wish to be \nunderstood as expressing our tacit approval of such irregularities, or of the \nomission from the record of formal entries affirmatively disclosing the strict \ncompliance by the court below with those provisions of law prescribing the \nprocedure to be followed in all criminal proceedings. On the contrary, we deem \nit of the utmost importance that criminal trials should proceed, at every step, \nin strict accord with the prescribed rules of procedure, and that care should be \ntaken to make the record affirmatively disclose the various incidents of the \ntrial in such form as to leave no room for doubt or question as to what actually \noccurred. In a former case we quoted from the case of Beale <em>vs.<\/em> \nCommonwealth (25 Penn. State, 11, 18), as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We are not to expect too much from the records of judicial proceedings. They \nare memorials of the judgments and decrees of the judges, and contain a general \nbut not a particular detail of all that occurs before them. If we should insist \nupon finding every fact fully recorded which must occur before a citizen can be \npunished for an offense against the laws, we should destroy public justice, and \ngive unbridled license to crime. Much must be left to intendment and \npresumption, for it is often less difficult to do things correctly than to \ndescribe them correctly.\" <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In that case however, after holding that the omission of an affirmative entry \nin the record showing that the trial judge had advised the accused who appeared \nwithout counsel of his right to have counsel, was not reversible error, we \nquoted an observation by the supreme court of New Mexico in making a somewhat \nsimilar ruling, as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Notwithstanding this ruling, we would not advise that a custom so honored by \ntime and high authority should be disregarded under any circumstances.\" (2 N. \nM., 160.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Although omissions from the record and irregularities and informalities in \nthe proceedings do not always amount to reversible error, nevertheless it is in \nthe highest degree incumbent upon the trial courts and their officers, including \nthe judges, fiscals, clerks and attorneys, to see that the record sets forth a \nfull and complete report of all the incidents of the trial, so far as that is \nhumanly possible, and to take care, also, that there is no relaxation in that \nstrict compliance with all the prescribed formalities of procedure which \nexperience has shown to be necessary to the due administration of justice in \ncriminal cases.<\/p>\n<p>We are convinced that the slovenly and careless manner in which some of the \nrecords of criminal cases brought here on appeal appear to have been kept in the \ncourts below is not infrequently indicative of a laxity or informality in all \nthe proceedings which reflects on the various officers of the courts wherein \nthese records originate, including the judge, the clerk, the fiscal, and the \nattorneys. These observations are made at this time, in the hope that, the \nattention of the trial courts having been directed to these matters, we may look \nforward to a decided improvement in the conduct of the proceedings in those \ncourts in criminal cases, and in the manner in which the records of those cases \nare prepared and preserved.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment entered in the court below convicting and sentencing the \nappellant should be affirmed, with the costs of this instance against him.

Relying on the case of \nthe United States <em>vs.<\/em> Cardell (23 Phil. Rep., 207), it is urged that \nthe offense as charged was triable in the Court of First Instance of Manila and \nnot in Iloilo, it appearing that under defendant's contract with the insurance \ncompany, the premiums collected by the defendant were payable at its office in \nManila, In that case, wherein the allegations of the information were \nsubstantially similar to those in the case at bar, we held that the Court of \nFirst Instance of Manila had jurisdiction of the offense charged, on the ground \nthat under the contract by the defendant with the insurance company, the \ninsurance premiums collected by him in Cebu were payable in the offices of the \ncompany in the city of Manila, and that the offense charged\u2014that is to say, the \nfailure to remit these premiums\u2014was triable in Manila because it was consummated \nby the failure of the defendant in that case to turn over the funds at the \noffice of the company in Manila. We did not hold in the former case, however, \nthat the Court of First Instance of Cebu, where the premiums were collected, did \nnot have concurrent jurisdiction with that of Manila; and we are of opinion that \noffenses such as that committed in the case at bar and in the case just cited, \nwhich are committed partly in one province and partly in another\u2014that is to say, \nwhere some acts material and essential to the crime and requisite to its \nconsummation occur in one province and some in another\u2014the case may be tried in \neither.<br\/><br\/>In the case at bar the accused is charged with having collected \nthe premium upon a certain policy in the Province of Iloilo and there and then \nappropriating the amount collected to his own use instead of turning it over to \nthe company at its offices in Manila in accordance with the terms of his \ncontract.<\/p>\n<p>In accordance with our ruling in the case of the United States <em>vs.<\/em> \nCardell (<em>supra<\/em>), the offense, if committed, was partly committed in the \ncity of Manila and partly in the Province of Iloilo. The failure to turn over \nthe funds to the insurance company in Manila was an act material and essential \nto the crime, and requisite to its consummation. So, also, the alleged \ncollection and appropriation of the premium in the Province of Iloilo and the \nfailure to remit it to the company in Manila in accordance with the terms of the \nalleged contract was an act material and essential to the crime and requisite to \nits consummation. The offense having been committed partly in the Province of \nIloilo and partly in the city of Manila we are of opinion that the Court of \nFirst Instance of that province had concurrent jurisdiction with that of Manila \nover the offense thus committed.<\/p>\n<p>Under the strict rules of the common law, based upon the rule that \nindictments could be found in that county only in which the crime has been \ncommitted, it was at one time doubtful whether a crime committed partly in one \ncounty and partly in another could be punished in either. (Bacon Abr. Tit. \nIndictment; 4 Bl. Comm. 303; 1 Chitty Crim. L. 178.) Though it was held that the \nproper view was that such an offense is indictable in the county wherein it is \nconsummated, it is now very generally provided by statute that where crimes are \ncommitted partly in one county and partly in another, the accused is indictable \nin either, and it has been held that such statutes are not repugnant to the \nconstitutional provision that the accused shall be entitled to a trial in the \ncounty where the crime was committed. (Smith<em> vs.<\/em> State, 42 Florida, \n605.)<\/p>\n<p>Section 6 of General Orders No. 58 provides that: \"A complaint or information \nis sufficient if it shows: * * * 4. That the offense was committed within the \njurisdiction of the court and is triable therein.\"<\/p>\n<p>As hereinbefore indicated, we are of opinion that in this jurisdiction, where \nthe strict common-law rules touching the finding of indictments have no \ncontrolling influence, offenses committed partly in one province and partly in \nanother, that is to say, where some acts material and essential to the crime and \nrequisite to its consummation occur in one province and some in another, are \ntriable in either province, the appropriate courts in each province having \nconcurrent jurisdiction of such offenses under the provisions of the above cited \nsection of General Orders No. 58.<\/p>\n<p>No witnesses were called by the prosecution, but certain documents marked \n\"Prosecution's Exhibits A, B, and C\" were introduced without objection, and the \ndefense admitted that the accused had collected the sum of P116.62 mentioned in \nthe information and that he had not turned it over to the complainant company. \nExhibit A is the formal appointment and contract of defendant as an agent of the \ninsurance company. Exhibits B and C are reports of the defendant made to the \ncompany during the term of his employment as its agent.<\/p>\n<p>The evidence for the defense is summarized by the Solicitor-General in his \nbrief in this Court, as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The defendant, being duly sworn, testified in his own behalf substantially \nas follows: <\/p>\n<p>\"I am 28 years of age, married, clerk, and a resident of Iloilo. I was \nformerly an agent of the West Coast Life Insurance Company, and while acting as \nsuch wrote a policy for Adriano Hernandez, for which I was entitled to a \ncommission of F101.67 for the first half year and an additional P101.67 at the \ntime of the payment of the second semiannual premium. I did not collect the \npremium on this policy and have not received any commission upon it. I also \nwrote a policy for Cecilio Dayot, for which I am entitled to P51.48 commission \nand which the company has not yet paid to me. The regular agent of the company, \nJose Maria Igpuara, told me that he had collected the premiums on the \nabove-mentioned policies. I also wrote policies for Messrs. Escarilla and \nPeralta, and Luisa Caraza upon which Mr. Igpuara collected the premiums. I \nreceived certain advances from Igpuara upon these policies, but have not been \npaid in full. I collected the premium on the policy written for Luis Golez, but \nhave not turned it over to the company; Exhibit D is the receipt I gave him for \nthe amount collected. The premium on the Golez policy was P116.62 and my \ncommission thereon was P64.14; and as the company had been owing me P58 for some \ntime I did not turn over the P52.48 due the company upon this policy. The \ncompany is indebted to me in the sum of P208 upon policies written by me. Some \nof this work was done prior to my appointment as agent of the West Coast Life \nInsurance Company, but I had an understanding with Mr. Calvo, the company's \ngeneral agent. Mr. Calvo did not settle with me in full for the work I did for \nhim prior to my appointment as agent of the company, and told me to keep the \nfirst premium that I collected. My contract of employment with the West Coast \nLife Insurance Company calls for the immediate turning over of all premiums \ncollected to the company's general agent. The practice of the agents here, \nhowever, has been to retain the commissions and send the balance of the premiums \ncollected to the Manila office. Mr. Northcott was the general agent to whom I \nshould report and send premiums after I had signed the contract with the \ncompany.<\/p>\n<p>\"Jose Maria Igpuara, being duly sworn, testified substantially as \nfollows:<\/p>\n<p>\"I am 28 years of age, married, life insurance agent, and a resident of \nIloilo. I am an agent of the West Coast Life Insurance Company, and as such know \nthat the premiums on the policies belonging to Messrs. Hernandez, Dayot, and \nColez, and Luisa Caraza have been paid. The defendant was employed by Calvo \nwhile the latter was the agent of the West Coast Life Insurance Company. As such \nsubagent the defendant was responsible only to the agent who appointed him and, \nnot to the company; that is, the company had nothing to do with him. When Mr. \nGray, cashier of the company, came here he suspended the defendant as agent for \nthe company. Mr. Gray then took charge of the premium on Governor Hernandez's \npolicy and I was sent to collect it. Governor Hernandez told me that he could \nnot pay the entire amount of the premium at that time, but gave me his \npromissory note for P116 to be credited on account of the premium due on his \npolicy. Mr. Hernandez did not owe the defendant any commission on account of his \npolicy that I know of. The defendant wrote policies for Luisa Caraza and Cecilio \nDayot, and secured certain advances from some policy holders. When the defendant \nwas dismissed I received a letter from Mr. Northcott, directing me to collect \nall of the papers in the hands of the defendant and I made a demand upon him for \nsuch papers as he had in his possession, but he has not delivered them to \nme.<br\/><br\/>\"Ernesto M. Calvo, being duly sworn, testified substantially as \nfollows:<\/p>\n<p>\"I am 33 years of age, single, and a resident of Iloilo. I was formerly agent \nof the West Coast Life Insurance Company for the Provinces of Panay and Negros. \nI appointed the defendant an agent of the company in February or March last. I \nwas authorized to appoint agents the same as Mr. Northcott. I had a number of \nagents working for me down here and they looked to me for their commission. The \nagents appointed by me were also appointed by the company, because I was not \nallowed to appoint without the consent of the company. I do not owe the \ndefendant anything; I don't know whether the company does or not. I told the \ndefendant that if a settlement was not made with him he could take what was due \nhim out of the first premium he collected. I had no right to do this, but did it \nin order to get him to work for my company, and to show him that I really came \ndown here representing Mr. Northcott. I was not authorized to hold out any money \non premiums collected, but directed to send all moneys collected to Manila. I \nhave not made a settlement with the company yet for my services. The defendant \nand I were rivals and could not agree with each other at the time he asked for \nhis commissions; I recommended to the company that the defendant be not \nappointed as agent, but he was appointed by the company on May 4. I think the \ndefendant had already been appointed by the company when the policy of Felix \nGolez was written. I think I received this policy in April. On July 7 I received \nan order from the company to turn over all papers to Mr. Igpuara, and I did so. \nMy contract with the company was the same as the document marked Exhibit A; but \nin addition thereto I had a letter from the company and verbal instructions from \nMr. Northcott. Mr. Northcott told me I was authorized to do anything, hence he \nis responsible, if anybody is, and not I.<\/p>\n<p>\"Adriano Hernandez, being duly sworn, testified substantially as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\"I am 42 years of age, married, and am serving as provincial governor of \nIloilo. I gave this defendant my promissory note for P116 at his request in \norder to assist him to make a payment. This promissory note was not made in \nconsideration of any policy of mine issued by the West Coast Life Insurance \nCompany. By request of the defendant I made the promissory note payable to Mr. \nIgpuara to whom the note was delivered by me. At that time my policy had been \ncanceled, but later on I was given another physical examination and my policy \nwas renewed. Later, by agreement with Mr. Igpuara and the defendant, I advanced \nthe difference between the amount of the promissory note already given and the \namount of the premium due on my policy in payment of my premium. I received a \nletter from the Manila office advising me that I could see this defendant about \nmy policy instead of seeing Mr. Calvo. When I signed the promissory note for \nP116 I had in mind to help the defendant to make a settlement with the \ncompany.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Giving the accused the benefit of the doubt which arises on a review of the \nwhole record, we think he must be acquitted of the crime with which he is \ncharged. Upon a strict construction of the terms of his contract, it would seem \nto have been the duty of the accused to turn over to the company, or its duly \nauthorized agent, the amount which he is alleged to have improperly retained, \nand await a settlement to be made thereafter of any claims he may have had \nagainst the company. But if, as a matter of fact, the company was indebted to \nhim for commissions on policies secured by him, it would appear that he was \nacting under the express authority of one of the company's general agents in \nretaining the amount of this indebtedness, pending a settlement of his accounts \nwith the company. The evidence of the defense on this point is not disputed.<\/p>\n<p>With no evidence before us tending to prove that the accused was not \njustified in relying upon the instructions and authority of the company's agent \nin this regard we do not think that he can be held <em>criminally<\/em> liable \nfor the retention of any amount which, in good faith, he believed the company \nwas indebted to him.<\/p>\n<p>The real question for determination in this case is, therefore, whether the \naccused, in good faith, believed the company to be indebted to him in the amount \nwhich it is charged and admitted he collected and failed to turn over. Upon this \npoint we are of opinion that the evidence is not sufficiently conclusive to \nsustain a finding beyond a reasonable doubt. It is quite evident that there were \ndifferences between the accused and the company's local and general agents as to \nwhom the commissions on various policies should be paid; and giving the accused \nthe benefit of the doubt, we do not think that the evidence of record is \nsufficient to maintain a finding that his claim of indebtedness against the \ncompany was not made in good faith, in the honest belief that he was entitled to \nthe commissions claimed by him.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial court should \ntherefore be reversed and the accused acquitted of the offense with which he is \ncharged, with the costs in both instances <em>de officio.<\/em> So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Upon arraignment, the defendant demurred on the grounds \nthat a complaint had previously been filed against him in the justice of the \npeace court of Kabankalan of the said province, for the same criminal offense; \nthat he had been tried and sentenced by the said justice of the peace court; \nthat, as no appeal was taken from the said judgment, either by the injured party \nor by the Government, the same had become final; and that, therefore, the Court \nof First Instance could not, pursuant to the provisions of section 26 of General \nOrders No. 58, try him again for the same offense. Upon these grounds he prayed \nthat the new complaint filed against him be dismissed. \n<p>After hearing the provincial fiscal, who asked that the demurrer be overruled \nbecause the facts therein alleged might serve as a defense but not as grounds \nfor a demurrer, and because, though such allegations might be true, they did not \nconstitute jeopardy, the Court of First Instance, by order of December 10, 1912, \nand upon the grounds that the accused had been placed in jeopardy and that the \njudgment of the justice of the peace court had become <em>res adjudicata,<\/em> \nsustained the demurrer, dismissed the case with costs <em>de officio,<\/em> and \nordered the cancellation of the bail bond given by the accused.<\/p>\n<p>The said order having been appealed from by the provincial fiscal, the case \nwas brought before this court for a decision upon the appeal, by virtue of \nmandamus proceedings instituted by the Attorney-General against the trial \njudge.<\/p>\n<p>In the first place, the fact that an accused person has been placed in \njeopardy is not one of the instances in which section 21 of General Orders No. \n58 authorizes the presentation of a demurrer, or, rather, the fact cannot be set \nup as a ground for a demurrer to the complaint or information, because it is not \nincluded among the instances specified in said section.<\/p>\n<p>Once in jeopardy is an answer, or, rather, according to section 24 of that \nGeneral, Order, it is a plea that may be set up by the accused with or without \nthe plea of not guilty, and, pursuant to the same section, may be made in a case \nwhere the accused has presented one or more of the demurrers specified in the \nsaid section 21, and such demurrers have been overruled by the court and the \naccused is consequently required to plead. The plea of jeopardy must not be \nconfused with the demurrer: the latter must be based upon facts or allegations \nwhich appear in the complaint or information itself and its presentation raises \na question of law; while the former is established on facts which constitute a \nground of defense for the accused and which must be proven.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, the plea of jeopardy made by the accused in this case in the guise \nof a demurrer to the complaint filed against him was erroneously and improperly \nsustained by the lower court.<\/p>\n<p>In the second place, the record shows in fact that on September 23, 1912, a \ncomplaint was filed in the justice of the peace court of Kabankalan by the \nChinaman Yap Sayco, <em>alias<\/em> Sinqui, against the defendant herein, Felix \nRubin, by virtue whereof he was sentenced by the said justice of the peace court \nof Kabankalan, on the 30th of the same month, to pay a fine of 15 \n<em>pesetas<\/em> as guilty of a misdemeanor against the person, in accordance \nwith the provisions of article 589 of the Penal Code; but in that complaint the \nsaid Felix Rubin was charged with the crime of <em>lesiones menos graves,<\/em> \ndefined and punished, so the complaint says, by article 418 of the Penal Code, \nfor having maltreated the complainant and inflicted upon him injuries which \nprevented him from engaging in his habitual labors for at least eight days and \nmade medical attendance necessary for the same period.<\/p>\n<p>In order that a defendant may legally be placed in jeopardy, one of the \nnecessary and indispensable conditions is that he should have been tried before \na competent court.<\/p>\n<p>As article ,418 of the Penal Code provides for and punishes the crime of \n<em>lesiones menos graves<\/em> by the penalty of <em>arresto mayor<\/em>, or by \n<em>destierro<\/em> and a fine of from 325 to 3,250 <em>pesetas<\/em>, it is \nevident that the justice of the peace court of Kabankalan lacked jurisdiction to \nhear the complaint filed therein by the Chinaman Yap Sayco against Felix Rubin \nand to try him under that complaint, because justice of the peace courts only \nhave jurisdiction in criminal cases to try parties charged with misdemeanors and \ninfractions of municipal ordinances, arising within the municipality, in which \nthe penalty provided by law does not exceed six months' imprisonment or a fine \nof P200 section 4 of Act No. 2041), and although the penalty of <em>arresto \nmayor<\/em> does not exceed six months' imprisonment, said article 418 of the \nPenal Code also provides, as a penalty that may be imposed for the crime of \n<em>lesiones menos graves,<\/em> instead of that of arresto mayor, the penalty of \n<em>destierro<\/em> and a fine not exceeding 8,250 <em>pesetas<\/em>, that is, \nP650, neither of which penalties can be imposed by justices of the peace, \npursuant to section 4 of Act No. 2041 and section 2 of Act No. 2131.<br\/><br\/>As \nthe defendant was not tried by a court of competent jurisdiction, when he was \narraigned before the justice of the peace court of Kabankalan upon the complaint \ntherein filed against him by the Chinaman Yap Sayco; on September 23, 1913, he \nhas not legally been placed in jeopardy in the present case.<\/p>\n<p>We therefore set aside the order appealed from and the dismissal of the case \ntherein made, together with all the other mandates therein contained, to the end \nthat the case be proceeded with in accordance with the law.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Both were sentenced to the \naccessories of the law, with allowance of credit for half the time of their \ndetention, and to payment of the costs in equal parts.\n<p>It was fully shown at the trial that the defendant Juan Rivera legally \nmarried Anselma Garcia on June 3, 1893, in the town of Lubao, Pampanga, and \nduring the first years of their marriage they had various children, of whom only \nGregorio Rivera has survived; that said spouses continued to live together until \n1902 when Rivera separated from his wife and went to live in marital relations \nwith Rafaela Vitug, who was likewise separated from her husband Carlos Punsalan; \nthat since the said year 1902 the defendant Rivera and Vitug have been living \ntogether as man and wife in different places and especially in the town of \nLubao, Pampanga; that since that time they have been seen to go about always \ntogether in public, in the church, and even in the streets of this city of \nManila, for on one occasion when the injured wife met them in one of the streets \nof Manila, Juan Rivera told her that he was seeking pretexts for separating from \nhis concubine; that both in the houses the defendant Rivera had in the barrio of \nPulita of the town of Florida blanca and in the barrio of San Vicente of Lubao, \nas well as in the house of the parents of the defendant Vitug in the barrio of \nSan Francisco and in that of the grandfather of the defendant Rivera himself in \nthe barrio of San Nicolas of the said town of Lubao, they were seen to retire \ntogether and to pass the nights lying in each other's embrace in the same \nbed.<\/p>\n<p>The facts set forth really constitute the crime of concubinage with scandal, \nprovided for and punished in article 437 of the Penal Code, for the defendant \nJuan Rivera, lawful husband of the complainant Anselma Garcia, separated from \nher and has been living from 1902 up to the date of the complaint, January 24, \n1913, with Rafaela Vitug, also married, and they have been going about the \nstreets of the town wherein they resided and performing overt acts of \nconcubinage in sight of everybody, without any reserve or consideration of the \noffense to law and morality, their conduct producing a bad example among their \nneighbors and other acquaintances; wherefore it is beyond doubt that they have \nviolated the penal law.<\/p>\n<p>The defendants pleaded not guilty, and Rafaela Vitug, the only one who \ntestified in the case, denied that she had lived in marital relations with her \ncodefendant Juan Rivera.<\/p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the facts stated, it appears from the trial that since 1902, \nwhen Juan Rivera ceased to live with his wife Anselma Garcia, until 1912, when \nthe latter filed a complaint that her husband was living in concubinage with \nanother woman, with whom he lias been living within and without the conjugal \nhome for a period of more than ten years, the complainant has remained silent in \nspite of the fact that she frequently saw her husband in company with his \nconcubine in the same town in which she lived.<\/p>\n<p>On June 13, 1912, the offended woman filed a complaint in the justice of the \npeace court of Lubao, charging her husband Juan Rivera and Rafaela Vitug with \nadultery, because they had entered into marital relations with great scandal (p. \n47); but by another document dated the 17th of the same month and year, the \ncomplainant Anselma Garcia set forth that in filing the foregoing complaint she \nhad confided in the disinterested advice of certain persons, but as she could \nnot rely upon the evidence to sustain it and having no interest in prosecuting \nit further, she desisted and withdrew it and asked for final dismissal of the \ncase, which was ordered by the justice of the peace (p. 53). The next day, June \n18, the separated spouses executed in the presence of two witnesses the document \nat page 44, ratified before a notary public, wherein they both appear to have \ndeclared among other things that because of incompatibility of habits and \nbecause they were unable to live together as husband and wife, by common \nagreement they had been separated since the year 1902, after which date it had \nbeen agreed that their only child Gregorio Rivera should continue to live with \nand be under the care of its mother Anselma Garcia, but that at any time their \nsaid child should desire and wish to live with its father for the sake of its \neducation, its mother would not oppose this; and moreover they solemnly declared \nthat each one renounced any claim for damages against the other, in case they \nmight have such either at that time or in the future accruing to either by \nreason of their marriage, and therefore they renounced any right that they might \nhave in their favor from that time thenceforward.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, under date of January 24,1913, the injured woman again filed \nher complaint, charging her husband Rivera and his concubine Rafaela Vitug with \nthe crime of concubinage with public scandal.<\/p>\n<p>Article 437 of the Penal Code says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The husband who shall keep a concubine in his home, or out of it with \nscandal, shall be punished with the penalty of <em>prision correccional<\/em> in \nits minimum and medium degrees.<\/p>\n<p>\"The concubine shall be punished with banishment.<\/p>\n<p>\"The provisions of articles 434 and 435 are applicable to the case referred \nto in this article.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Article 434 of the same code says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"No penalty shall be imposed for the crime of adultery except upon the \ncomplaint of the aggrieved spouse.<\/p>\n<p>\"The aggrieved spouse can only file such a complaint against both offenders, \nif both are living, and not at all if he or she has consented to the adultery or \npardoned either of them.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If the provisions of the second paragraph of this article 434 are applicable \nto the case of a husband accused of concubinage with scandal, according to the \nprovisions of the last paragraph of the above-quoted article 437 of the code, \nthen when it has once been shown in this case that the complainant Anselma \nGarcia gave her consent to the concubinage of her husband with Rafaela Vitug, \nwithout having appealed to the authorities to denounce the act for more than ten \nyears after they began to live together in the same town in which she resided, \nit is evident that she can institute no criminal action against her husband and \nhis concubine, by reason of her consent, as prescribed in the above-quoted \narticle 434 of the Penal Code.<\/p>\n<p>The long period of time of over ten years that elapsed during which her \nhusband Juan Rivera was separated from her after 1902 and living in marital \nrelations with Rafaela Vitug, without its having occurred to her to denounce \nsuch unlawful conduct, although they all lived in the town of Lubao, where the \nimmoral life her husband was leading with the defendant Vitug was public and \nnotorious, is proof of her consent thereto, and if only in June, 1912, it \noccurred to her to accuse him of adultery, although a few days later she \ndesisted from her complaint and on the next day by common accord they executed \nthe agreement of separation set forth in the document at page 44, ratified \nbefore a notary, the injured party has by such conduct demonstrated in an \nindubitable manner that if before 1912 she had given her consent to the illegal \nconduct of her husband, later she ratified it in a document setting forth that \nshe withdrew the complaint she had presented and in the agreement of separation \nof which mention has been made.<\/p>\n<p>It has been alleged by the defense that the injured woman filed the complaint \nagainst her husband in 1912 by inducement of persons opposed to him in the \nelection for the office of municipal president of Lubao, for which her husband \nRivera was a candidate; and that the later complaint filed in January of 1913 by \nlike inducement was due to the fact that he had been elected president. <\/p>\n<p>The theory to be deduced from these allegations is not impossible or \nunlikely, because the silence Anselma Garcia kept during ten years and her later \nattitude from the time when her erring husband might become president of the \ntown of Lubao, as did happen, remain unexplained; but even putting aside such a \ntheory and regarding it as a coincidence, it appears in the case that the \ninjured woman Anselma Garcia consented to the concubinage of her husband from \n1902 up to the date of her last complaint in January, 1913; and therefore, under \nthe provisions of article 434 of the Penal Code, her complaint of concubinage \nwith scandal must be dismissed by reason of her consent, indicated by her \nsilence for over ten years.<\/p>\n<p>It is to be noted that said crime is of almost a public nature, although for \nthe prosecution and punishment thereof the cause must be instituted by virtue of \na complaint of the injured spouse, in accordance with the last paragraph of \narticle 437 of the Penal Code; and as it is not a crime-of a private nature, it \nis not enumerated in Act No. 1773. <\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from should be reversed and \nthe case dismissed along with the complaint that instituted it, with the costs \nin both instances <em>de officio<\/em>.

He has shown that, at the time of \ntaking the timber, he in good faith believed that he was the owner thereof and \nthat he took it openly and avowedly under that claim.

No indemnity was awarded to the injured party, because he \nintroduced no specific evidence to show whether or not he was entitled thereto. \nThis judgment sustained that of February 18, preceding, as a result of the \nevidence introduced at the new trial had on petition of the accused, who \nappealed from the said judgment to this court.\n<p>At about 4 o'clock of the afternoon of July 5, 1913, as Benedicto Magnani, \none of the companions of the contractor of the work on the Sabang Bridge in the \npueblo of Batangas, was about to pour a pail of gravel into a measuring barrel \nin order to fill it up, the accused, Canent, objected to his so doing on the \nground that that was not one of the conditions of the contract. A dispute then \narose between them and the accused snatched the pail of gravel from Magnani's \nhand, whereupon they quarreled and struck each other with their fists. At this \nmoment Ottavio Machetti, according to his testimony, approached in order to \nseparate them, but the accused said that he came up to help his companion, \nMagnani. Thereupon the accused Canent struck Machetti with his right fist, from \nwhich, protruded a closed pocketknife ; the blow caused a lesion on the left ear \nof about a centimeter and a half in length which healed after ten days, \nprofessional attendance and did not prevent Machetti from performing his \ncustomary labors. A medical examination showed (page 14 of the record) that this \nwound was light and curable in seven days; that it would not have prevented him \nfrom pursuing his usual occupation, though healing thereof was retarded by a \npledget which was inserted between the edges of the wound, wherefore it did not \nheal up for ten days.<\/p>\n<p>These facts appear to have been duly proven in this case and the crime is \nproperly classified as that of <em>lesiones menos graves<\/em> under article 418 \nof the Penal Code, inasmuch as the accused, simply because he saw Machetti \napproaching and thought the latter would assist the man with whom he was \nquarreling, struck Machetti a blow over the left eyebrow, thereby inflicting \nupon him a wound which was cured ten days afterwards without leaving any bad \nresults.<\/p>\n<p>Defendant pleaded not guilty and alleged that the injured party, Ottavio \nMachetti, came up while he was having a dispute with Benedicto Magnani; that as \nMachetti assisted the latter, the defendant struck him on the mouth, where upon \nhe and Machetti fought and the latter, in defending himself with his right arm, \nfell face downward on the ground and must have injured his left eyebrow by \nstriking some hard substance in his fall. This allegation does not appear to be \nsustained by any evidence whatever, for his own witness, Leoncio Hertes, \ntestified that he did not see Machetti fall to the ground, and Benedicto Magnani \ncorroborated the testimony given by Machetti to the effect that the latter \napproached Magnani and the accused for the purpose of separating them, whereupon \nMachetti was assaulted by the defendant.<br\/><br\/>A consideration of the \ncontradictory testimony given by the witnesses for the defense at the rehearing \ndoes not warrant the inference that the allegation of the accused is true. Juan \nPagcaliuagan testified that it was Magnani who held the pail of gravel; Agustin \nCantos declared that it was the defendant, Rufino Canent, and Ottavio Machetti \nwho snatched away the pail; and while Pagcaliuagan stated that it was Magnani \nwho struck the accused, on the other hand Agustin Cantos declared that it was \nMachetti who struck him. In view of these contradictions, therefore, it is \nimpossible to consider any of the facts to be proven by the testimony of \nwitnesses who refute one another.<\/p>\n<p>Matanoglio Prieto, a witness called in rebuttal, testified that Pagcaliuagan \nwas unable to see what occurred because both he and Prieto were in a low place \nwhence they could not see what was going on; that the place of the occurrence \nwas on high ground. It must therefore be believed that this witness did not see \nwhat happened, for he himself testified that the place where the quarrel took \nplace was about four meters and a half higher than the wall which Pagcaliuagan \nwas filling in. Hence, it would be improper to find that there was any \nprovocation or that anything took place tending to exempt the defendant in \ncommitting the unlawful act. However, consideration can be taken of the \ncircumstance of loss of reason and self-control in the heat of anger, owing to \nthe fact that Ganent was assaulted by Benedicto Magnani and that during the \nquarrel, when these two men were approached by Ottavio Machetti, Magnani's \ncompanion and a relative of the contractor, the accused had substantial grounds \nfor the belief that Machetti came up for the purpose of helping Ganent's \nopponent, Magnani.<\/p>\n<p>It is undeniable that the trial court acted in accordance with the law in \nrefusing to grant the petition of counsel for the defense to admit the testimony \nof two other witnesses who were present at the hearing of the case, although \nthey were not in due season called upon to testify. The testimony of these \nwitnesses would not have been newly discovered evidence. It would have been \nadditional evidence, which the defense voluntarily failed to produce at the \nhearing of the case as it believed that that already submitted was sufficient to \nprove the defendant's innocence, and such belief did not entitle it to introduce \nnew evidence upon the reopening of the case.<\/p>\n<p>The allegation is made that section 4 of Act No. 2041, as amended by section \n2 of Act No. 2131, is unconstitutional for t]|e reason that it diminishes and \nrestricts the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance in providing that it \nmay assign certain cases limitedly specified in the said Acts to the justice of \nthe peace of the capital of the province for trial. This cannot be sustained. \nThe provisions mentioned do not diminish or curtail the jurisdiction of the \nCourt of First Instance by the fact of authorizing him to assign the trial of \nsuch cases to the justice of the peace of the capital of the province in order \nthat this latter officer, sharing the former's powers, may act in his stead, \nespecially in the cases limitedly specified by law, and relieve the Court of \nFirst Instance from the duty of attending to them so that its attention may not \nbe diverted from the more serious and important cases that come before it. \nBesides, {it was intended that cases thus assigned should be tried in accordance \nwith the rules of procedure observed in the Courts of First Instance, and not. \nwith those that govern proceedings in the justice of the peace courts. The Act \nproviding for the organization of courts in the Philippine Islands contains no \nprovision whatever that conflicts with the Acts aforementioned, with respect to \nthe assignment of cases by the Courts of First Instance to the justices of the \npeace. Neither do these latter Acts violate the provisions of the Philippine \nBill, since, pursuant to section 9 of this Act of Congress of July 1,1902, the \nSupreme Court and the Courts of First Instance of the Philippine Islands shall \npossess and exercise jurisdiction as heretofore provided and such additional \njurisdiction as shall hereafter be prescribed by the Government of said Islands, \nsubject to the power of said Government to change the practice and method of \nprocedure. In providing that justices of the peace in the capitals of provinces \nmay, by assignment of the respective judge of the district in each case, have \nlike jurisdiction as the Court of First Instance to try persons charged with an \noffense for which the penalty does not exceed two years' imprisonment or a fine \nof two thousand pesos, or both such imprisonment and fine, the legislature of \nthis country has merely made use of the power and authority conferred upon it by \nthe said section 9 of the Act of Congress called the Philippine Bill.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment \nappealed from have been refuted, the said judgment should be, as it is hereby, \naffirmed, with the costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

That to the due hearing of \nthe above entitled action be issued a writ of prohibition perpetually \nrestraining the respondent Yangco Steamship Company, its appraisers, \nagents, servants or other representatives from accepting to carry and \nfrom carrying, in steamers of said company dynamite, powder or other \nexplosive substance, in accordance with the resolution of the board of \ndirectors and of the shareholders of said company.<br\/><br\/>\"Second. That a\n writ of prohibition be issued perpetually enjoining the respondent J. \nS. Stanley as Acting Collector of Customs of the Philippine Islands, his\n successors, deputies, servants or other representatives, from \nobligating the said Yangco Steamship Company, by any means whatever, to \ncarry dynamite, powder or other explosive substance.<br\/><br\/>\"Third. That\n a writ of prohibition be issued perpetually\u00a0 enjoining the respondent \nIgnacio Villamor as Attorney-General of the Philippine Islands, and W. \nH. Bishop as prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila, their deputies,\n representatives or employees, from accusing the said Yangco Steamship \nCompany, its officers, agents or servants, of the violation of Act No. \n98 by reason of the failure or omission of the said company to accept \nfor carriage or to carry dynamite, powder or other explosive.<br\/><br\/>\"Fourth.\n That the petitioner be granted such other remedy as may be meet and \nproper.\"<\/blockquote>To this complaint the respondents demurred,\n and we are of opinion that the demurrer must be sustained, on the \nground that the complaint does not set forth facts sufficient to \nconstitute a cause of action.<br\/><br\/>It will readily be seen that \nplaintiff seeks in these proceedings to enjoin the steamship company \nfrom accepting for carriage on any of its vessels, dynamite, powder or \nother explosives, under any conditions whatsoever; to prohibit the \nCollector of Customs and the prosecuting officers of the government from\n all attempts to compel the company to accept such explosives for \ncarriage on any of its vessels under any conditions whatsoever; and to \nprohibit these officials from any attempt to invoke the penal provisions\n of Act No. 98, in any case of a refusal by the company or its officers \nso to do; and this without regard to the conditions as to safety and so \nforth under which such explosives are offered for carriage, and without \nregard also to any question as to the suitableness for the \ntransportation of such explosives of the particular vessel upon which \nthe shipper offers them for carriage; and further without regard to any \nquestion as to whether such conduct on the part of the steamship company\n and its officers involves in any instance an undue, unnecessary or \nunreasonable discrimination to the prejudice of any person, locality or \nparticular kind of traffic.<br\/><br\/>There are no allegations in the \ncomplaint that for some special and sufficient reasons all or indeed any\n of the company's vessels are unsuitable for the business of \ntransporting explosives; or that shippers have declined or will in \nfuture decline to comply with such reasonable regulations and to take \nsuch reasonable precautions as may be necessary and proper to secure the\n 'safety of the vessels of the company in transporting such explosives. \nIndeed the contention of petitioner is that a common carrier in the \nPhilippine Islands may decline to accept for carriage any shipment of \nmerchandise of a class which it expressly or impliedly declines to \naccept from all shippers alike, because, as he contends \"the duty of a \ncommon carrier to carry for all who offer arises from the public \nprofession he has made, and is limited by it.\"<br\/><br\/>In support of this\n contention counsel cites a number of English and American authorities, \ndiscussing and applying the doctrine of the common law with reference to\n common carriers. But it is unnecessary now to decide whether, in the \nabsence of statute, the principles on which the American and English \ncases were decided would be applicable in this jurisdiction. The duties \nand liabilities of common carriers in this jurisdiction are defined and \nfully set forth in Act No. 98 of the Philippine Commission, and, until \nand unless that statute be declared invalid or unconstitutional, we are \nbound by its provisions.<br\/><br\/>Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Act are as \nfollows:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 2. It shall be unlawful for any common \ncarrier engaged in the transportation of passengers or property as above\n set forth to make or give any unnecessary or unreasonable preference or\n advantage to any particular person, company, firm, corporation or \nlocality, or any particular kind of traffic in any respect whatsoever, \nor to subject any particular person, company, firm, corporation or \nlocality, or any particular kind of traffic, to any undue or \nunreasonable prejudice or discrimination whatsoever, and such unjust \npreference or discrimination is also hereby prohibited and declared to \nbe unlawful.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC. 3. No common carrier engaged in the carriage \nof passengers or property as aforesaid shall, under any pretense \nwhatsoever, fail or refuse to receive for carriage, and as promptly as \nit is able to do so without discrimination, to carry any person or \nproperty offering for carriage, and in the order in which such persons \nor property are offered for carriage, nor shall any such common carrier \nenter into any arrangement, contract or agreement with any other person \nor corporation whereby the latter is given an exclusive or preferential \nprivilege over any other person or persons to control or monopolize the \ncarriage of any class or kind of property to the exclusion or partial \nexclusion of any other person or persons, and the entering into any such\n arrangement, contract or agreement, under any form or pretense \nwhatsoever, is hereby prohibited and declared to be unlawful.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC.\n 4. Any willful violation of the provisions of this Act by any common \ncarrier engaged in the transportation of passengers or property as \nhereinbefore set forth is hereby declared to be punishable by a fine not\n exceeding five thousand dollars money of the United States, or by \nimprisonment not exceeding two years, or both, within the discretion of \nthe court.\"<\/blockquote>The validity of this Act has been questioned on \nvarious grounds, and it is vigorously contended that in so far as it \nimposes any obligation on a common carrier to accept for carriage \nmerchandise of a class which he makes no public profession to carry, or \nwhich he has expressly or impliedly announced his intention to decline \nto accept for carriage from all shippers alike, it is ultra vires, \nunconstitutional and void.<br\/><br\/>We may dismiss without extended \ndiscussion any argument or contention as to the invalidity of the \nstatute based on alleged absurdities inherent in its provisions or on \nalleged unreasonable or impossible requirements which may be read into \nit by a strained construction of its terms.<br\/><br\/>We agree with counsel\n for petitioner that the provision of the Act which prescribes that, \"No\n common carrier * * * shall, under any pretense whatsoever, fail or \nrefuse to receive for carriage, and * * * to carry any person or \nproperty offering for carriage,\" is not to be construed in its literal \nsense and without regard to the context, so as to impose an imperative \nduty on all common carriers to accept for carriage, and to carry all and\n any kind of freight which may be offered for carriage without regard to\n the facilities which they may have at their disposal. The legislator \ncould not have intended and did not intend to prescribe that a common \ncarrier running passenger automobiles for hire must transport coal in \nhis machines; nor that the owner of a tank steamer, expressly \nconstructed in small watertight compartments for the carriage of crude \noil must accept a load of cattle or of logs in the rough; nor that any \ncommon carrier must accept and carry contraband articles, such as opium,\n morphine, cocaine, or the like, the mere possession of which is \ndeclared to be a criminal offense; nor that common carriers must accept \neggs offered for transportation in paper parcels or any merchandise \nwhatever so defectively packed as to entail upon the company \nunreasonable and unnecessary care or risks.<br\/><br\/>Read in connection \nwith its context this, as well as all the other mandatory and \nprohibitory provisions of the statute, was clearly intended merely to \nforbid failures or refusals to receive persons or property for carriage \ninvolving any \"unnecessary or unreasonable preference or advantage to \nany particular person, company, firm, corporation or locality, or any \nparticular kind of traffic in any respect whatsoever,\" or which would \n\"subject any particular person, company, firm, corporation or locality, \nor any particular kind of traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice\n or discrimination whatsoever.\"<br\/><br\/>The question, then, of construing\n and applying the statute, in cases of alleged violations of its \nprovisions, always involves a consideration as to whether the acts \ncomplained of had the effect of making or giving an \"unreasonable or \nunnecessary preference or advantage\" to any person, locality or \nparticular kind of traffic, or of subjecting any person, locality, or \nparticular kind of traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or \ndiscrimination.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is very clear therefore that the language of the \nstatute itself refutes any contention as to its invalidity based on the \nalleged unreasonableness of its mandatory or prohibitory provisions.<br\/><br\/>So\n also we may dismiss without much discussion the contentions as to the \ninvalidity of the statute, which are based on the alleged excessive \nseverity of the penalties prescribed for violation of its provisions. \nUpon general principles it is peculiarly and exclusively within the \nprovince of the legislator to prescribe the pains and penalties which \nmay be imposed upon persons convicted of violations of the laws in force\n within his territorial jurisdiction. With the exercise of his \ndiscretion in this regard the courts have nothing to do, save only in \ncases where it is alleged that excessive fines or cruel and unusual \npunishments have been prescribed, and even in such cases the courts will\n not presume to interfere in the absence of the clearest and most \nconvincing argument and proof in support of such contentions. (Weems <i>vs.<\/i>\n United States, 217 U. S., 349; U. S. <i>vs.<\/i> Pico, 18 Phil. Rep., \n386.) We need hardly add that there is no ground upon which to rest a \ncontention that the penalties prescribed in the statute under \nconsideration are either excessive or cruel and unusual, in the sense in\n which these terms are used in the organic legislation in force in the \nPhilippine Islands.<br\/><br\/>But it is contended that on account of the \npenalties prescribed the statute should be held invalid upon the \nprinciples announced in <i>Ex parte<\/i> Young (209 U. S., 123, 147, 148)\n ; Cotting <i>vs.<\/i> Godard (183 U. S., 79, 102) ; Mercantile Trust Co.\n <i>vs.<\/i> Texas Co. (5.1 Fed., 529) ; Louisville Ry. <i>vs.<\/i> McCord\n (103 Fed., 216) ; Cons. Gas Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Mayer (416 Fed., 150). We \nare satisfied however that the reasoning of those cases is not \napplicable to the statute under consideration. The principles announced \nin those decisions are fairly indicated in the following citations found\n in petitioner's brief:<br\/><blockquote>\"But when the legislature, in an \neffort to prevent any inquiry of the validity of a particular statute, \nso burdens any\u00a0 challenge thereof in the courts that the party affected \nis necessarily constrained to submit rather than take the chances of the\n penalties imposed, then it becomes a serious question whether the party\n is not deprived of the equal protection of the laws. (Cotting <i>vs.<\/i>\n Godard, 183 U. S., 79, 102.)<br\/><br\/>\"It may therefore be said that when\n the penalties for dis-obedience are by fines so enormous and \nimprisonment so severe as to intimidate the company and its officers \nfrom resorting to the courts to test the validity of the legislation, \nthe result is the same as if the law in terms prohibited the company \nfrom seeking judicial construction of laws which deeply affect its \nrights.<br\/><br\/>\"It is urged that there is no principle upon which to \nbase the claim that a person is entitled to disobey a statute at least \nonce, for the purpose of testing its validity, without subjecting \nhimself to the penalties for disobedience provided by the statute in \ncase it is valid. This is not an accurate statement of the case. \nOrdinarily a law creating offenses in the nature of misdemeanors or \nfelonies relates to a subject over which the jurisdiction of the \nlegislature is complete in any event. In the case, however, of the \nestablishment of certain rates without any hearing, the validity of such\n rates necessarily depends upon whether they are high enough to permit \nat least some return upon the investment (how much it is not now \nnecessary to state), and an inquiry as to that fact is a proper subject \nof judicial investigation. If it turns out that the rates are too low \nfor that purpose, then they are illegal. Now, to impose upon a party \ninterested the burden of obtaining a judicial decision of such a \nquestion (no prior hearing having ever been given) only upon the \ncondition that, if unsuccessful, he must suffer imprisonment and pay \nfines, as provided in these acts, is, in effect, to close up all \napproaches to the courts, and thus prevent any hearing upon the question\n whether the rates as provided by the acts are not too low, and \ntherefore invalid. The distinction is obvious between a case where the \nvalidity of the act depends upon the existence of a fact which can be \ndetermined only after investigation of a very complicated and technical \ncharacter, and the ordinary case of a statute upon a subject requiring \nno such investigation, and over which the jurisdiction of the \nlegislature is complete in any event.<br\/><br\/>\"We hold, therefore, that \nthe provisions of the acts relating to the enforcement of the rates, \neither for freight or passsengers, by imposing such enormous fines and \npossible imprisonment as a result of an unsuccessful effort to test the \nvalidity of the laws themselves, are unconstitutional on their face, \nwithout regard to the question of the insufficiency of those rates. (<i>Ex\n parte<\/i> Young, 209 U. S., 123, 147, 148.)\"<\/blockquote>An examination\n of the general provisions of our statute, of the circumstances under \nwhich it was enacted, the mischief which it sought to remedy and of the \nnature of the penalties prescribed for violations of its terms convinces\n us that, unlike the statutes under consideration in the above cited \ncases, its enactment involved no attempt to prevent com\u00acmon carriers \n\"from resorting to the courts to test the validity of the legislation;\" \nno \"effort to prevent any inquiry\" as to its validity. It imposes no \narbitrary obligation upon the company to do or to refrain from doing \nanything. It makes no attempt to compel such carriers to do business at a\n fixed or arbitrarily designated rate, at the risk of separate criminal \nprosecutions for every demand of a higher or a different rate. Its \npenalties can be imposed only upon proof of \"unreasonable,\" \n\"unnecessary\" and \"unjust\" discriminations, and range from a maximum \nwhich is certainly not excessive for willful, deliberate and \ncontumacious violations of its provisions by a great and powerful \ncorporation, to a minimum which may be a merely nominal fine. With so \nwide a range of discretion conferred upon the courts, there is no \nsubstantial basis for a contention on the part of any common carrier \nthat it or its officers are \"intimidated from resorting to the courts to\n test the validity\" of the provisions of the statute prohibiting such \n\"unreasonable,\" \"unnecessary\" and \"unjust\" discriminations, or to test \nin any particular case whether a given course of conduct does in fact \ninvolve such discrimination. We will not presume, for the purpose of \ndeclaring the statute invalid, that there is so real a danger that the \nCourts of First Instance and this court on appeal will abuse the \ndiscretion thus conferred upon us, as to intimidate any common carrier, \nacting in good faith, from resorting to the courts to test the validity \nof the statute. Legislative enactments, penalizing unreasonable \ndiscriminations, unreasonable restraints of trade, and unreasonable \nconduct in various forms of human activity are so familiar and have been\n so frequently sustained in the courts, as to render extended discussion\n unnecessary to refute any contention as to the invalidity of the \nstatute under consideration, merely because it imposes upon the carrier \nthe obligation of adopting one of various courses of conduct open to it,\n at the risk of incurring a prescribed penalty in the event that the \ncourse of conduct actually adopted by it should be held to have involved\n an unreasonable, unnecessary or unjust discrimination. Applying the \ntest announced in <i>Ex parte<\/i> Young, <i>supra<\/i>, it will be seen \nthat the validity of the Act does not depend upon \"the existence of a \nfact which can be determined only after investigation of a very \ncomplicated and technical character,\" and that \"the jurisdiction of the \nlegislature\" over the subject with which the statute deals \"is complete \nin any event.\" There can be no real question as to the plenary power of \nthe legislature to prohibit and to penalize the making of undue, \nunreasonable and unjust discriminations by common carriers to the \nprejudice of any person, locality or particular kind of traffic. (See \nMunn <i>vs.<\/i> Illinois, 94 U. S., 113, and other cases hereinafter \ncited in support of this proposition.)<br\/><br\/>Counsel for petitioner \ncontends also that the statute, if construed so as to deny the right of \nthe steamship company to elect at will whether or not it will engage in a\n particular business, such as that of carrying explosives, is \nunconstitutional \"because it is a confiscation of property, a taking of \nthe carrier's property without due process of law,\" and because it \ndeprives him of his liberty by compelling him to engage in business \nagainst his will. The argument continues as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"To require \nof a carrier, as a condition to his continuing in said business, that he\n must carry anything and everything is to render useless the facilities \nhe may have for the carriage of certain lines of freight. It would be \nalmost as complete a confiscation of such facilities as if the same were\n destroyed. Their value as a means of livelihood would be utterly taken \naway. The law is a prohibition to him to continue in business; the \nalternative is to get out or to go into some other business\u2014the same \nalternative as was offered in the case of the Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. <i>vs.<\/i>\n Dey (35 Fed. Rep., 866, 880), and which was there commented on as \nfollows: <br\/><blockquote>\" 'Whatever of force there may be in such \narguments, as applied to mere personal property capable of removal and \nuse elsewhere, or m\" other business, it is wholly without force as \nagainst railroad corporations, so large a proportion of whose investment\n is in the soil and fixtures appertaining thereto, which cannot be \nremoved. For a government, whether that government be a single sovereign\n or one of the majority, to say to an individual who has invested his \nmeans in so laudable an enterprise as the construction of a railroad, \none which tends so much to the wealth and prosperity of the community, \nthat, if he finds that the rates imposed will cause him to do business \nat a loss, he may quit business, and abandon that road, is the very \nirony of despotism. Apples of Sodom were fruit of joy in comparison. \nReading, as I do, in the preamble of the Federal Constitution, that it \nwas ordained to \"establish justice,\" I can never believe that it is \nwithin the power of state or nation thus practically to confiscate the \nproperty of an individual invested in and used for a purpose in which \neven the Argus eyes of the police power can see nothing injurious to \npublic morals, public health, or the general welfare. I read also in the\n first section of the bill of rights of this state that \"all men are by \nnature free and equal, and have certain inalienable rights, among which \nare those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, \npossessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety \nand happiness;\" and I know that, while that remains as the supreme law \nof the state, no legislature can directly or indirectly lay its \nwithering or destroying hand on a single dollar invested in the \nlegitimate business of transportation.' \" (Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. <i>vs.<\/i>\n Dey, 35 Fed. Rep., 866, 880.)<\/blockquote>It is manifest, however, that\n this contention is directed against a construction of the statute, \nwhich, as we have said, is not warranted by its terms. As we have \nalready indi\u00accated, the statute does not \"require of a carrier, as a \ncondition to his continuing in said business, that he must carry \nanything and everything,\" and thereby \"render useless the facilities he \nmay have for the carriage of certain lines of freight.\" It merely \nforbids failures or refusals to receive persons or property for carriage\n which have the effect of giving an \"unreasonable or unnecessary \npreference or advantage\" to any person, locality or particular kind of \ntraffic, or of subjecting any person, locality or particular kind of \ntraffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or discrimination.<br\/><br\/>Counsel\n expressly admits that the statute, \"as a prohibition against \ndiscrimination is a fair, reasonable and valid exercise of government,\" \nand that \"it is necessary and proper that such discrimination be \nprohibited and prevented,\" but he contends that \"on the other hand there\n is no reasonable warrant nor valid excuse for depriving a person of his\n liberty by requiring him to engage in business against his will. If he \nhas a rolling boat, unsuitable and unprofitable for passenger trade, he \nmay devote it to lumber carrying. To prohibit him from using it unless \nit is fitted out with doctors and stewards and staterooms to carry \npassengers would be an invalid confiscation of his property. A carrier \nmay limit his business to the branches thereof that suit his \nconvenience. If his wagon be old, or the route dangerous, he may avoid \nliability for loss of passengers' lives and limbs by carrying freight \nonly. If his vehicles require expensive pneumatic tires, unsuitable for \nfreight transportation, he may nevertheless carry passengers. The only \nlimitation upon his action that it is competent for the governing \nauthority to impose is to require him to treat all alike. His \nlimitations must apply to all, and they must be established limitations.\n He cannot refuse to carry a case of red <i>jusi<\/i> on the ground that \nhe has carried for others only <i>jusi<\/i> that was green, or blue, or \nblack. But he can refuse to carry red <i>jusi<\/i>, if he has publicly \nprofessed such a limitation upon his business and held himself out as \nunwilling to carry the same for anyone.\"<br\/><br\/>To this it is sufficient\n answer to say that there is nothing in the statute which would deprive \nany person of his liberty \"by requiring him to engage in business \nagainst his will.\" The prohibitions of the statute against undue, \nunnecessary or unreasonable preferences and discriminations are merely \nthe reasonable regulations which the legislator has seen fit to \nprescribe (for the conduct of the business in which the carrier is \nengaged of his own free will and accord. In so far as the self-imposed \nlimitations by the carrier upon the business conducted by him, in the \nvarious examples given by counsel, do not involve an unreasonable or \nunnecessary discrimination the statute would not control his action in \nany wise whatever. It operates only in cases involving such unreasonable\n or unnecessary preferences or discrimi\u00acnations. Thus in the \nhypothetical case suggested by the petitioner, a carrier engaged in the \ncarriage of green, blue or black <i>jusi<\/i>, and duly equipped therefor\n would manifestly be guilty of \"giving an unnecessary and unreasonable \npreference to a particular kind of traffic\" and of subjecting to \"an \nundue and unreasonable prejudice a particular kind of traffic,\" should \nhe decline to carry red <i>jusi<\/i>, to the prejudice of a particular \nshipper or of those engaged in the manufacture of that kind of <i>jusi<\/i>,\n basing his refusal on the ground of \"mere whim or caprice\" or of mere \npersonal convenience. So a public carrier of passengers would not be \npermitted under this statute to absolve himself from liability for a \nrefusal to carry a Chinaman, a Spaniard, an American, a Filipino, or a <i>mestizo<\/i>\n by proof that from \"mere whim or caprice or personal scruple,\" or to \nsuit his own convenience, or in the hope of increasing his business and \nthus making larger profits, he had publicly announced his intention not \nto carry one or other of these classes of passengers.<br\/><br\/>The nature \nof the business of a common carrier as a public employment is such that \nit is clearly within the power of the state to impose such just and \nreasonable regulations thereon in the interest of the public as the \nlegislator' may deem proper. Of course such regulations must not have \nthe effect of depriving an owner of his property without due process of \nlaw, nor of confiscating or appropriating private property without just \ncompensation, nor of limiting or prescribing irrevocably vested rights \nor privileges lawfully acquired under a charter or franchise. But aside \nfrom such constitutional limitations, the determination of the nature \nand extent of the regulations which should be prescribed rests in the \nhands of the legislator.<br\/><br\/>Common carriers exercise a sort of \npublic office', and have duties to perform in which the public is \ninterested. Their business is, therefore, affected with a public \ninterest, and is subject of public regulation. (New Jersey Steam Nav. \nCo. <i>vs.<\/i> Merchants Bank, 6 How., 344, 382; Munn <i>vs.<\/i> \nIllinois, 94 U. S., 113, 130.) Indeed, this right of regulation is so \nfar beyond question that it is well settled that the power of the state \nto exercise legislative control over railroad companies and other \ncarriers \"in all respects necessary to protect the public against \ndanger, injustice and oppression\" may be exercised through boards of \ncommissioners. (New York etc. R. Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Bristol, 151 U. S., 556,\n 571; Connecticut etc. R. Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Woodruff, 153 U. S., 689.)<br\/><br\/>Regulations\n limiting the number of passengers that may be carried in a particular \nvehicle or steam vessel, or forbidding the loading of a vessel beyond a \ncertain point, or prescribing the number and qualifications of the \npersonnel in the employ of a common carrier, or forbidding unjust \ndiscrimination as to rates, all tend to limit and restrict his liberty \nand to control to some degree the free exercise of his discretion in the\n conduct of his business.\u00a0 But since the Granger cases were decided by \nthe Supreme Court of the United States no one questions the power of the\n legislator to prescribe such reasonable regulations upon property \nclothed with a public interest as he may deem expedient or necessary to \nprotect the public against danger, injustice or oppression. (Munn <i>vs.<\/i>\n Illinois, 94 U. S., 113, 130; Chicago etc. R. Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Cutts, 94 \nU. S., 155; Budd <i>vs.<\/i> New York, 143 U. S., 517; Cotting <i>vs.<\/i>\n Godard, 183 U. S., 79.) The right to enter the public employment as a \ncommon carrier and to offer one's services to the public for hire does \nnot carry with it the right to conduct that business as one pleases, \nwithout regard to the interests of the public and free from such \nreasonable and just regulations as may be prescribed for the protection \nof the public from the reckless or careless indifference of the carrier \nas to the public welfare and for the prevention of unjust and \nunreasonable discrimination of any kind whatsoever in the performance of\n the carrier's duties as a servant of the public.<br\/><br\/>Business of \ncertain kinds, including the business of a common carrier, holds such a \npeculiar relation to the public interest that there is superinduced upon\n it the right of public regulation. (Budd <i>vs.<\/i> New York, 143 U. \nS., 517, 533.) When private property is \"affected with a public interest\n it ceases to be <i>juris privati<\/i> only.\" Property becomes clothed \nwith a public interest when used in a manner to make it of public \nconsequence and affect the community at large. \"When, therefore, one \ndevotes his property to a use in which the public has an interest, he, \nin effect, grants to the public an interest in that use, and must submit\n to be controlled by the public for the common good, to the extent of \nthe interest he has thus created. He may withdraw his grant by \ndiscontinuing the use, but so long as he maintains the use he must \nsubmit to control.\" (Munn <i>vs.<\/i> Illinois, 94 U. S., 113; Georgia R.\n &amp; Bkg. Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Smith, 128 U. S., 174; Budd <i>vs.<\/i> New \nYork, 143 U. S., 517; Louisville etc. Ry. Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Kentucky, 161 \nU. S., 677, 695.)<br\/><br\/>Of course this power to regulate is not a power\n to destroy, and limitation is not the equivalent of confiscation. Under\n pretense of regulating fares and freight the state can not require a \nrailroad corporation to carry persons or property without reward. Nor \ncan it do that which in law amounts to a taking of private property for \npublic use without just compensation, or without due process of law. \n(Chicago etc. R. Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Minnesota, 134 U. S., 418; Minneapolis \nEastern R. Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Minnesota, 134 U. S., 467.) But the judiciary \nought not to interfere with regulations established under legislative \nsanction unless they are so plainly and palpably unreasonable as to make\n their enforcement equivalent to the taking of property for public use \nwithout such compensation as under all the circumstances is just both to\n the owner and to the public, that is, judicial interference should \nnever occur unless the case presents, clearly and beyond all doubt, such\n a flagrant attack upon the rights of property under the guise of \nregulations as to compel the court to say that the regulation in \nquestion will have the effect to deny just compensation for private \nproperty taken for the public use. (Chicago etc. R. Co. <i>vs.<\/i> \nWellman, 143 U. S., 339; Smyth <i>vs.<\/i> Ames, 169 U. S., 466, 524; \nHenderson Bridge Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Henderson City, 173 U. S., 592, 614.)<br\/><br\/>Under\n the common law of England it was early recognized that common carriers \nowe to the public the duty, of carrying indifferently for all who may \nemploy them, and in the order in which application is made, and without \ndiscrimination as to terms. True, they were allowed to restrict their \nbusiness so as to exclude particular classes of goods, but as to the \nkinds of property which the carrier was in the habit of carrying in the \nprosecution of his business he was bound to serve all customers alike \n(State <i>vs.<\/i> Cincinnati etc. R. Co., 47 Ohio St., 130, 134, 138; \nLouisville etc. Ry. Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Queen City Coal Co., 13 Ky. L. Rep., \n832); and it is to be observed in passing that these common law rules \nare themselves regulations controlling, limiting and prescribing the \nconditions under which common carriers were permitted to conduct their \nbusiness. (Munn <i>vs.<\/i> Illinois, 94 U. S., 113,133.)<br\/><br\/>It was \nfound, in the course of time, that the correction of abuses which had \ngrown up with the enormously increasing business of common carriers \nnecessitated the adoption of statutory regulations controlling the \nbusiness of common carriers, and imposing severe and drastic penalties \nfor violations of their terms. In England, the Railway Clauses \nConsolidation Act was enacted in 1845, the Railway and Canal Traffic Act\n in 1854, and since the passage of those Acts much additional \nlegislation has been adopted tending to limit and control the conduct of\n their business by common carriers. In the United States, the business \nof common carriers has been subjected to a great variety of statutory \nregulations. Among others Congress enacted \"The Interstate Commerce Act\"\n (1887) and its amendments, and the Elkins Act as amended (1906) ; and \nmost if not all of the States of the Union have adopted similar \nlegislation regulating the business of common carriers within their \nrespective jurisdictions. Unending litigation has arisen under these \nstatutes and their amendments, but nowhere has the right of the state to\n prescribe just and reasonable regulations controlling and limiting the \nconduct of the business of common carriers in the public interest and \nfor the general welfare been successfully challenged, though of course \nthere has been wide divergence of opinion as to the reasonableness, the \nvalidity and legality of many of the regulations actually adopted.<br\/><br\/>The\n power of the Philippine legislator to prohibit and to penalize all and \nany unnecessary or unreasonable dis-criminations by common carriers may \nbe maintained upon the same reasoning which justified the enactment by \nthe Parliament of England and the Congress of the United States of the \nabove mentioned statutes prohibiting and penalizing the granting of \ncertain preferences and dis-criminations in those countries. As we have \nsaid before, we find nothing confiscatory or unreasonable in the \nconditions imposed in the Philippine statute\" upon the business of \ncommon carriers. Correctly construed they do not force him to engage in \nany business against his will or to make use of his facilities in a \nmanner or for a purpose for which they are not reasonably adapted. It is\n only when he offers his facilities as a common carrier to the public \nfor hire, that the statute steps in and prescribes that he must treat \nall alike, that he may not pick and choose which customer he will serve,\n and, specifically, that he shall not make any undue or unreasonable \npreferences or discriminations whatsoever to the prejudice not only of \nany person or locality but also of any particular kind of traffic.<br\/><br\/>The\n legislator having enacted a regulation prohibiting common carriers from\n giving unnecessary or unreasonable preferences or advantages to any \nparticular kind of traffic or subjecting any particular kind of traffic \nto any undue or unreasonable prejudice or discrimination whatsoever, it \nis clear that whatever may have been the rule at the common law, common \ncarriers in this jurisdiction cannot lawfully decline to accept a \nparticular class of goods for carriage, to the prejudice of the traffic \nin those goods, unless it appears that for some sufficient reason the \ndiscrimination against the traffic in .such goods is reasonable and \nnecessary. Mere whim or prejudice will not suffice. The grounds for the \ndiscrimination must be substantial ones, such as will justify the courts\n in holding the discrimination to have been reasonable and necessary \nunder all the circumstances of the case.<br\/><br\/>The prayer of the \npetition in the case at bar cannot be granted unless we hold that the \nrefusal of the defendant steamship company to accept for carriage on any\n of its vessels \"dynamite, gunpowder or other explosives\" would in no \ninstance involve a violation of the provisions of this statute. There \ncan be little doubt, however, that cases may and will arise wherein the \nrefusal of a vessel \"engaged in the coastwise trade of the Philippine \nIslands as a common carrier\" to accept such explosives for carriage \nwould subject some person, company, firm or corporation, or locality, or\n particular kind of traffic to a certain prejudice or dis-crimination. \nIndeed it cannot be doubted that the refusal of a \"steamship company, \nthe owner of a large number of vessels\" engaged in that trade to receive\n for carriage any such explosives on any of its vessels would subject \nthe traffic in such explosives to a manifest prejudice and \ndiscrimination. The only question to be determined therefore is whether \nsuch prejudice or discrimination might in any case prove to be undue, \nunnecessary or unreasonable.<br\/><br\/>This of course is, in each case, a \nquestion of fact, and we are of opinion that the facts alleged in the \ncomplaint are not sufficient to sustain a finding in favor of the \ncontentions of the petitioner. It is not alleged in the complaint that \n\"dynamite, gunpowder and other explosives\" can in no event be \ntransported with reasonable safety on board steam vessels engaged in the\n business of common carriers. It is not alleged that all, or indeed any \nof the defendant steamhip company's vessels are unsuited for the \ncarriage of such explosives. It is not alleged that the nature of the \nbusiness in which the steamship company is engaged is such, as to \npreclude a finding that a refusal to accept such explosives on any of \nits vessels would subject the traffic in such explosives to an undue and\n unreasonable prejudice and discrimination.<br\/><br\/>Plaintiff's \ncontention in this regard is as follows:<br\/><blockquote>\"In the present \ncase, the respondent company has expressly and publicly renounced the \ncarriage of explosives, and expressly excluded the same in terms from \nthe business it conducts. This in itself were sufficient, even though \nsuch exclusion of explosives were based on no other ground than the mere\n whim, caprice or personal scruple of the carrier. It is unnecessary, \nhowever, to indulge in academic discussion of a moot question, for the \ndecision not to carry explosives rests on substantial grounds which are \nself-evident.\"<\/blockquote>We think however that the answer to the \nquestion whether such a refusal to carry explosives involves an \nunnecessary or unreasonable preference or advantage to any person, \nlocality or particular kind of traffic or subjects any person, locality \nor particular kind of traffic to an undue or unreasonable prejudice or \ndiscrimination is by no means \"self-evident,\" and that it is a question \nof fact to be determined by the particular circumstances of each case.<br\/><br\/>The\n words \"dynamite, powder or other explosives\" are broad enough to \ninclude matches, and other articles of like nature, and may fairly be \nheld to include also kerosene oil, gasoline and similar products of a \nhighly inflammable and explosive character. Many of these articles of \nmerchandise are in the nature of necessities in any country open to \nmodern progress and advancement. We are not fully advised as to the \nmethods of transportation by which they are made commercially available \nthroughout the world, but certain it is that dynamite, gunpowder, \nmatches, kerosene oil and gasoline are transported on many vessels \nsailing the high seas. Indeed it is matter of common knowledge that \ncommon carriers throughout the world transport enormous quantities of \nthese explosives, on both land and sea, and there can be little doubt \nthat a general refusal of the common carriers in any country to accept \nsuch explosives for carriage would involve many persons, firms and \nenterprises in utter ruin, and would disastrously affect the interests \nof the public and the general welfare of the community.<br\/><br\/>It would \nbe going far to say that a refusal by a steam vessel engaged in the \nbusiness of transporting general merchandise as a common carrier to \naccept for carriage a shipment of matches, solely on the ground of the \ndangers incident to the explosive quality of this class of merchandise, \nwould not subject the traffic in matches to an unnecessary, undue or \nunreasonable prejudice or discrimination without proof that for some \nspecial reason the particular vessel is not fitted to carry articles of \nthat nature. There may be and doubtless are some vessels engaged in \nbusiness as common carriers of merchandise, which for lack of suitable \ndeck space or storage rooms might be justified in declining to carry \nkerosene oil, gasoline, and similar products, even when offered for \ncarriage securely packed in cases; and few vessels are equipped to \ntransport those products in bulk. But in any case of a refusal to carry \nsuch products which would subject any person, locality or the traffic in\n such products to any prejudice or discrimination whatsoever, it would \nbe necessary to hear evidence before making an affirmative finding that \nsuch prejudice or discrimination was or was not unnecessary, undue or \nunreasonable. The making of such a finding would involve a consideration\n of the suitability of the vessel for the transportation of such \nproducts; the reasonable possibility of danger or disaster resulting \nfrom their transportation in the form and under the conditions in which \nthey are offered for carriage; the general nature of the business done \nby the carrier and, in a word, all the attendant circumstances which \nmight affect the question of the reasonable necessity for the refusal by\n the carrier to undertake the transportation of this class of \nmerchandise.<br\/><br\/>But it is contended that whatever the rule may be as\n to other explosives, the exceptional power and violence of dynamite and\n gunpowder in explosion will always furnish the owner of a vessel with a\n reasonable excuse for his failure or refusal to accept them for \ncarriage or to carry them on board his boat. We think however that even \nas to dynamite and gunpowder we would not be justified in making such a \nholding unaided by evidence sustaining the proposition that these \narticles can never be carried with reasonable safety on any vessel \nengaged in the business of a common carrier. It is said that dynamite is\n so erratic and uncontrollable in its action that it is impossible to \nassert that it can be handled with safety in any given case. On the \nother hand it is contended that while this may be true of some kinds of \ndynamite, it is a fact that dynamite can be and is manufactured so as to\n eliminate any real danger from explosion during transportation. These \nare of course questions of fact upon which we are not qualified to pass \njudgment without the assistance of expert witnesses who have made \nspecial studies as to the chemical composition and reactions of the \ndifferent kinds of dynamite, or attained a thorough knowledge of its \nproperties as a result of wide experience in its manufacture and \ntransportation.<br\/><br\/>As we construe the Philippine statute, the mere \nfact that violent and destructive explosions can be obtained by the use \nof dynamite under certain conditions would not be sufficient in itself \nto justify the refusal of a vessel, duly licensed as a common carrier of\n merchandise, to accept it for carriage, if it can be proven that in the\n condition in which it is offered for carriage there is no real danger \nto the carrier, nor reasonable ground to fear that his vessel or those \non board his vessel will be exposed to unnecessary and unreasonable risk\n in transporting it, having in mind the nature of his business as a \ncommon carrier engaged in the coastwise trade in the Philippine Islands,\n and his duty as a servant of the public engaged in a public employment.\n So also, if by the exercise of due diligence and the taking of \nreasonable precautions the danger of explosions can be practically \neliminated, the carrier would not be justified in subjecting the traffic\n in this commodity to prejudice or discrimination by proof that there \nwould be a possibility of danger from explosion when no such precautions\n are taken.<br\/><br\/>The traffic in dynamite, gunpowder and other \nexplosives is vitally essential to the material and general welfare of \nthe people of these Islands. If dynamite, gunpowder and other explosives\n are to continue in general use throughout the Philippines, they must be\n transported by water from port to port in the various islands which \nmake up the Archipelago. We are satisfied therefore that the refusal by a\n particular vessel, engaged as a common carrier of merchandise in the \ncoastwise trade of the Philippine Islands, to accept any or all of these\n explosives for carriage would constitute a violation of the \nprohibitions against discrimi\u00acnations penalized under the statute, \nunless it can be shown by affirmative evidence that there is so real and\n substantial a danger of disaster necessarily involved in the carriage \nof any or all of these articles of merchandise as to render such refusal\n a due or a necessary or a reasonable exercise of prudence and \ndiscretion on the part of the shipowner.<br\/><br\/>The complaint in the \ncase at bar lacking the necessary allegations under this ruling, the \ndemurrer must be sustained on the ground that the facts alleged do not \nconstitute a cause of action.<br\/><br\/>A number of interesting questions \nof procedure are raised and discussed in the briefs of counsel. As to \nall of these questions we expressly reserve our opinion, believing as we\n do that in sustaining the demurrer on the grounds indicated in this \nopinion we are able to dispose of the real issue involved in the \nproceedings without entering upon the discussion of the nice questions \nwhich it might have been necessary to pass upon had it appeared that the\n facts alleged in the complaint constitute a cause of action.<br\/><br\/>We \nthink, however, that we should not finally dispose of the case without \nindicating that since the institution of these proceedings the enactment\n of Acts No. 2307 and No. 2362 (creating a Board of Public Utility \nCommissioners and for other purposes) may have materially modified the \nright to institute and maintain such proceedings in this jurisdiction. \nBut the demurrer having been formally submitted for judgment before the \nenactment of these statutes, counsel have not been heard in this \nconnection. We therefore refrain from any comment upon any questions \nwhich might be raised as to whether or not there may be another adequate\n and appropriate remedy for the alleged wrong set forth in the \ncomplaint. Our disposition of the question raised by the demurrer \nrenders that unnecessary at this time, though it may not be improper to \nobserve that a careful examination of those acts confirms us in the \nholding upon which we base our ruling on this demurrer, that is to say \n\"That whatever may have been the rule at the common law, common carriers\n in this jurisdiction cannot lawfully decline to accept a particular \nclass of goods for carriage, to the prejudice of the traffic in those \ngoods, unless it appears that for some sufficient reason the \ndiscrimination against the traffic in such goods is reasonable and \nnecessary. Mere prejudice or whim will not suffice. The grounds\u00a0 of the \ndiscrimination must be\u00a0 substantial ones, such as will justify the \ncourts in holding the dis-crimination to have been reasonable and \nnecessary under all the circumstances of the case.\"<br\/><br\/>Unless an \namended complaint be filed in the meantime, let judgment be entered ten \ndays hereafter sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the complaint with\n costs against the complainant, and twenty days thereafter let the \nrecord be filed in the archives of original actions in this court.

(See paragraph 3 of the\n complaint.)<br\/><br\/>I base my opinion for a dismissal of the complaint \non the ground that the plaintiff has not alleged in his complaint a \nsingle one of the grounds, apart from that of being a stockholder, \nnecessary for him to allege to maintain a share-holder's action.<br\/><br\/>In\n the case of Hawes <i>vs.<\/i> Oakland (104 U. S., 450), it was said \nrelative to the right of a stockholder to bring an action which should \nregularly be brought by the company of which he is a stockholder:<br\/><blockquote>\"We\n understand that doctrine to be that, to enable a stockholder in a \ncorporation to sustain in a court of equity in his own name, a suit \nfounded on a right of action existing in the corporation itself, and in \nwhich the corporation itself is the appropriate plaintiff, there must \nexist as the foundation of the suit:<br\/><br\/>\"Some action or threatened \naction of the managing board of directors or trustees of the \ncorporation, which is beyond the authority conferred on them by their \ncharter or other source of organization;<br\/><br\/>\"Or such a fraudulent \ntransaction, completed or contemplated by the acting managers, in \nconnection with some other party, or among themselves, or with other \nshareholders as will result in serious injury to the corporation, or to \nthe interest of the other shareholders; \"Or where the board of \ndirectors, or a majority of them, are acting for their own interest, in a\n manner destructive of the corporation itself, or of the rights of the \nother shareholders;<br\/><br\/>\"Or where the majority of shareholders \nthemselves are oppressively and illegally pursuing a course in the name \nof the corporation, which is in violation of the rights of the other \nshareholders, and which can only be restrained by the aid of a court of \nequity.\" It was also said: \"In this country the cases outside of the \nFederal Courts are not numerous, and while they admit the right of a \nstockholder to sue in cases where the corporation is the proper party to\n bring the suit, they limit this right to cases where <i>the directors \nare guilty of a fraud or a breach of trust, or are proceeding ultra \nvires.<\/i>\"<\/blockquote>Further on in the same case we find: \"Conceding \nappellant's construction of the company's charter to be correct, there \nis nothing which forbids the corporation from dealing with the city in \nthe manner it has done.\u00a0 That city conferred on the company valuable \nrights by special ordinance; namely, the use of the streets for the \nlaying of its pipes, and the privilege of furnishing water to the whole \npopulation. It may be the exercise of the highest wisdom, to let the \ncity use the water in the manner complained of.\u00a0 The directors are \nbetter able to act understanding on this subject than a stockholder \nresiding in New York. The great body of the stockholders residing in \nOakland or other places in California may take this view of it, and be \ncontent to abide by the action of their directors.\"<br\/><br\/>This case is \nconclusive of the right of the plaintiff in the case at bar to maintain \nthe action. The complaint is devoid of allegations necessary to sustain a\n complaint by a shareholder.<br\/><br\/>The contention of the plaintiff \nbased upon the case of <i>Ex parte<\/i> Young (209 U. S. 123) is not \nsustained by that case. The decision there requires precisely the same \nallegations in the complaint as does the case of Hawes <i>vs.<\/i> \nOakland. Not one of those allegations appears in the complaint in the \ncase at bar except the allegation that the plaintiff is a stockholder.<br\/><br\/>Indeed,\n not only does the complaint lack allegations essential to its \nsufficiency, but it contains allegations which affirmatively show the \nplaintiff is not entitled to maintain the action. I do not stop to \nenumerate them all. I call attention to one only, namely the allegation \nthat the company, by its authorized officials, has acted in strict \nconformity with the plaintiff's wishes and has refused to accept \ndynamite for carriage. This allegation shows that the plaintiff has been\n able to obtain his remedy and accomplish his purpose within the \ncorporation itself, and it is sufficient, therefore, under the case of \nHawes <i>vs.<\/i> Oakland and that of <i>Ex parte<\/i> Young, to require \nthat the demurrer be sustained.<br\/><br\/>I am opposed to a decision of \nthis case on the merits.<br\/><br\/>In the first place, there has been no \nadequate discussion of the merits by the parties. Substantially all of \nthe brief of the government was devoted to what may be called the \ntechnical defects of the complaint, such as I have referred to above. \nIndeed, it is doubtful if any portion of the brief can be said to be \ndirectly a discussion of the merits.<br\/><br\/>In the second place, there \nis no real case pending in this court. It is clear from the complaint \nthat the case is a collusive one (not in any improper sense) between the\n plaintiff and defendant company. There is no reason found in the \ncomplaint why the company should not have brought the action itself, \nevery member of the board of directors and every stockholder, according \nto the allegations of the complaint, being in absolute accord with the \ncontentions of the plaintiff on the proposition that the company should \nnot carry dynamite, and having passed unanimously resolutions to. that \neffect. Moreover, there has been no violation of Act No. 98. No shipper,\n or any other person, has offered dynamite to the defendant company for \nshipment, and, accordingly, the defendant company has not refused to \naccept dynamite for carriage. Nor have the defendant government \nofficials begun proceedings, or threatened to bring proceedings, against\n the defendant company in any given case. According to the allegations \nof the complaint, the parties are straw parties and the case a straw \ncase.<br\/><br\/>In the third place, Act No. 98, under which this proceeding\n is brought and under which, it is, alleged, the defendant public \nofficers are threatening to enforce, has been repealed, in so far as it \naffects public service corporations, by Act No. 2307, as amended by Act \nNo. 2362. More than that; not only has the law been repealed, but \nproceedings of this character have been placed, in the first instance, \nunder the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board of Public Utilities. I am \nunable to see why this court should, under the facts of this case, \nundertake to render a decision on the merits when the Act under which it\n is brought has been repealed and the jurisdiction to render a decision \non the subject matter involved has been turned over to another body. As I\n have said before, it was unnecessary to a decision of this case to \ntouch the merits in any way; and I am opposed to an attempt to lay down a\n doctrine on a subject which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of \nanother body created by law expressly for the purpose of removing such \ncases as this from the jurisdiction of the courts.<br\/><br\/>I am of the \nopinion that the complaint should be dismissed, but upon grounds apart \nfrom the merits. If the merits of the case were alone to govern, I \nshould be distinctly in favor of the plaintiff's contention so far as it\n relates to the carriage of dynamite on ships carrying passengers; and, \nwhile I am opposed to a decision on the merits of this case, \nnevertheless, the merits having been brought into the case by the \nopinion of some of my brethren, I desire to refer briefly to the \njurisprudence of the subject.<br\/><br\/>So far as my researches go, the \nproposition that <i>passenger<\/i> boats must carry dynamite and other \nhigh explosives is without support in the decisions of any English \nspeaking country. I have been unable to find a case anywhere which lays \ndown such a doctrine. Indeed, I have been unable to find a case which \nholds that <i>freight<\/i> boats <i>must<\/i> carry dynamite or other high\n explosives. Every case that I have been able to find states a contrary \ndoctrine; and neither in courts nor in text books is there even a hint \nsupporting the contention of my brethren. The opinion cites no \nauthorities to support it; and I am constrained to believe that, in an \nopinion so elaborately written, cases to support its thesis would have \nbeen cited if any such existed.<br\/><br\/>On page 372, Vol. 6 of Cyc, will \nbe found the following: \"Common carriers owe to the public the duty of \ncarrying indifferently for all who may employ them, and in the order in \nwhich the application is made, and without discrimination as to terms. \nThey may, however, restrict their business so as to exclude particular \nclasses of goods, and they are not bound to receive dangerous articles, \nsuch as nitroglycerine, dynamite, gunpowder, oil of vitriol, matches, \netc.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of California Powder Works <i>vs.<\/i> Atlantic \nand Pacific U. R. Co. (113 Cal., 329), it was said: \"Nor are the \nexemptions contained in the contract of the shipping order void for lack\n of consideration.\u00a0 The defendant was not obliged to receive and \ntransport the powder at all. A common carrier is not bound to receive * *\n * dangerous articles, as nitro-glycerine, dynamite, gunpowder, <i>aqua \nfortis<\/i>, oil of vitriol, matches, etc.\"<br\/><br\/>This, so far as I can \nlearn, is the universal doctrine. The California case is reproduced in \n36 L. R. A., 648 and has appended to it a note. It is well known that \nthe L. R. A. cites in its notes all of the cases reasonably obtainable \nrelative to the subject matter of the case which it annotates. The note \nin L. R. A. with reference to the California case cites a considerable \nnumber of authorities holding that a carrier of goods is <i>not<\/i> \nobliged to receive dynamite or other dangerous explosives for carriage. \nIt does not cite or refer to a case which holds the contrary.<br\/><br\/>The\n reporter of L. R. A., at the beginning of the note with reference to \nthe California case, says: \"The law upon this question is to be drawn \nfrom inference or from <i>dicta<\/i> rather than from decided cases. \nCalifornia Powder Works <i>vs.<\/i> Atlantic &amp; Pacific R. R. Co. \nseems to be the first case to have squarely decided that the carrier is \nnot bound to transport dangerous articles, although there has been what \nmay be regarded as a general understanding that such is the fact.\"<br\/><br\/>In\n Hutchinson on Carriers (sec. 145), it is said, relative to the \nnecessity of a carrier receiving for carriage dynamite or other \ndangerous explosives: \"He may, for instance, lawully refuse to receive \nthem (the goods) if they are improperly packed or if they are otherwise \nin an unfit condition for carriage. Or he may show that the goods \noffered were of a dangerous character, which might subject him or his \nvehicle, or strangers or his passengers, or his other freight, to the \nrisk of injury.\"<br\/><br\/>In a note to the text the author says: \"Nor is \nhe bound to accept such articles as nitro-glycerine, dynamite, \ngun-powder, oil of vitriol and the like.\"<br\/><br\/>In Elliott on Railroads\n (vol. 4, p. 151), appears the following: \"Again, goods may properly be \nrefused which are tendered in an unfit condition for transportation, or \nwhich are dangerous, or which are reasonably believed to be dangerous.\"<br\/><br\/>In\n the case of Boston &amp; Albany Railroad Co. <i>vs.<\/i> Shanly (107 \nMass., 568), the court said at page 576: \"Both the dualin and the \nexploders are thus alleged to be explosive and dangerous articles. Each \nof them was sent without giving notice of its character to the \nplaintiffs, and they were ignorant in respect to it. The rule of law on \nthis subject is in conformity with the dictates of common sense and \njustice, and is well established. One who has in his possession a \ndangerous article, which he desires to send to another, may send it by a\n common carrier <i>if he will take it;<\/i> but it is his duty to give \nhim notice of its character, <i>so that he may either refuse to take it<\/i>,\n or be enabled, if he takes it, to make suitable provision against the \ndanger.\"<br\/><br\/>This case cites three English cases as follows, Williams\n <i>vs.<\/i> East India Co. (3 East, 192) ; Brass <i>vs.<\/i> Maitland (6 \nEl. &amp; Bl. 470) ; Farrant <i>vs.<\/i> Barnes (11 C. B. [N. S.], 553).<br\/><br\/>In\n the case of Porcher <i>vs.<\/i> Northeastern R. Co. (14 Rich. L., 181), \nthe court quoted with approval the following from Story on Bailments: \n\"If he (the carrier) refuses to take charge of the goods because his \ncoach is full or because they are of a nature which will at the time \nexpose them to <i>extraordinary danger<\/i> or to popular rage, or \nbecause he has no convenient means of carrying such goods with security,\n etc., <i>these will furnish reasonable grounds for his refusal<\/i>, and\n will, if true, be a sufficient legal defense to a suit for the \nnoncarriage of the goods.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Fish <i>vs.<\/i> Chapman\n (2 Ga., 349), the court said: \"A common carrier is bound to convey the \ngoods of any person offering to pay his hire, unless his carriage be \nalready full, or the <i>risk sought to be imposed upon him extraordinary<\/i>,\n or unless the goods be of a sort which he cannot convey or is not in \nthe habit of conveying.\"<br\/><br\/>In the case of Farrant <i>vs.<\/i> \nBarnes, above cited, the court said that the shipper \"knowing the \ndangerous character of the article and omitting to give notice of it to \nthe carrier <i>so that he might exercise his discretion as to whether he\n would take it or not<\/i> was guilty of a clear breach of duty.\"<br\/><br\/>To\n the same effect, generally, are Jackson <i>vs.<\/i> Rogers (2 Show., \n327); Riley vs. Home (5 Bing., 217) ; Lane <i>vs.<\/i> Cotton (1 Ld. \nRaym., 646); Edwards <i>vs.<\/i> Sherratt (1 East, 604) ; Batson <i>vs.<\/i>\n Donovan (1 Barn. &amp; Aid., 32; 2 Kent, 598); Elsee <i>vs.<\/i> Gatward\n (5 T. R., 143) ; Dwight <i>vs.<\/i> Brewster (1 Pick., 50) ; Jencks <i>vs.<\/i>\n Coleman (2 Sumn., 221) ; Story on Bail., 322, 323; Patton <i>vs.<\/i> \nMagrath (31 Am. Dec, 552).<br\/><br\/>In Story on Bailments (sec. 508), is \nfound the following: \"If a carrier refuses to take charge of goods \nbecause his coach is full; or because the goods are <i>of a nature which\n will at the time expose them to extraordinary danger;<\/i> * * * these \nwill furnish reasonable grounds for his refusal; and will, if true, be a\n sufficient legal defense to a suit for the noncarriage of the goods.\"<br\/><br\/>It\n will be noted that all of these cases holding that a common carrier is \nnot obliged to receive a dangerous substance, such as dynamite and other\n high explosives, <i>refer exclusively to carriers of merchandise<\/i> \nand <i>not to carriers of passengers<\/i>. If the authorities are uniform\n in holding that companies carrying freight are not obliged to accept \ndangerous explosives for carriage, there can be no question as to what \nthe rule would be with reference to a carrier of passengers.<br\/><br\/>Far \nfrom requiring passenger boats to accept dynamite and other high \nexplosives for carriage, the attitude of the people of the United States\n and of various States is shown by their statutes. The laws of the \nUnited States and of many of the States prohibit passengers boats and \npassenger trains from carrying dangerous explosives. Sections 232, 233, \n234, 235 and 236 of the Criminal Code of the United States (Compiled \nStat., 1901), read:<br\/><blockquote>\"SEC. 232. It shall be unlawful to \ntransport, carry, or convey, any dynamite, gunpowder, or other \nexplosive, between a place in a foreign country and a place within or \nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States, or between a place in \nany State, Territory, or District of the United States, or place \nnoncontiguous to but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, and a place in\n any other State, Territory, or District of the United States, or place \nnoncontiguous to but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, on any vessel \nor vehicle of any description operated by a common carrier, which vessel\n or vehicle is carrying passengers for hire:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *.<br\/><br\/>\"SEC.\n 233.

Not only this; the abilities of legislators have been taxed\n to the same end; to frame laws that would ensure seaworthy ships, safe \nappliances, and reliable officers and crews; to curb the avarice of \nthose who would subordinate the safety of passengers to a desire for \nfreight; and to so regulate travel by sea that all might safely confide \ntheir property and their lives to the ships sailing under the flag of \ntheir country. Can a decision which requires passenger ships to carry \ndynamite and all high explosives be made to harmonize with this purpose?\n What is there in the Philippine Islands to justify the requirement that\n passenger ships carry dynamite, while in the United States the carrying\n of dynamite by passenger ships is a crime? Why should passengers in the\n Philippine Islands be subjected to conditions which are abhorrent in \nthe United States? Why compel shipowners in the Philippine Islands to \nperform acts which, if done in the United States, would send them to the\n penitentiary?<br\/><br\/>I do not believe that we should require passengers\n to travel on ships carrying, perhaps, many tons of nitroglycerine, \ndynamite or gunpowder in their holds; nor do I believe that any public \nofficial should do anything calculated to add to the calamity of fire, \ncollision, or shipwreck the horrors of explosion.<br\/><br\/><br\/><hr align=\"CENTER\" noshade=\"NOSHADE\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/><br\/><br\/><center style=\"font-style: italic;\">DISSENTING<\/center><br\/><br\/><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">ARAULLO, J.,<\/span><br\/><br\/>I do not agree \nwith the decision of the majority of this court in this case, first, \nbecause one of the grounds of the demurrer to the complaint\u2014the first \none\u2014is that of lack of legal capacity to sue on the part of the \nplaintiff and nothing is said in the decision regarding this very \nimportant point.

If dynamite, gunpowder and other\n explosives are to continue in general use throughout the Philippines, \nthey must be transported by water from port to port in the various \nislands which make' up the Archipelago. We are satisfied therefore that \nthe refusal by a particular vessel, engaged as a common carrier of \nmerchandise in the coastwise trade of the Philippine Islands, to accept \nany or all of these explosives for carriage would constitute a violation\n of the prohibitions against discriminations penalized under the \nstatute, unless it can be shown by affirmative evidence that there is so\n real and substantial a danger of disaster necessarily involved in the \ncarriage of any or all of these articles of merchandise as to render \nsuch refusal a due or a necessary or a reasonable exercise of prudence \nand discretion on the part of the ship owner.\"<\/blockquote>Resting our \njudgment on these rulings we held that the allegations of the complaint,\n which in substance alleged merely that the respondent officials were \ncoercing the respondent steamship company to carry explosives upon some \nof their vessels, under authority of, and in reliance upon the \nprovisions of the Act, did not set forth facts constituting a cause of \naction; or in other words, that the allegations of the complaint even if\n true, would not sustain a finding that the respondent officials were \nacting \"without or in excess of their jurisdiction\" and lawful authority\n in the premises.<br\/><br\/>The amended complaint filed on November 14, \n1914, is substantially identical with the original complaint, except \nthat it charges the respondent officials, <i>as of the date of the \namended complaint<\/i>, with the unlawful exercise of authority or intent\n to exercise unlawful authority which should be restrained, and \nsubstitutes the names of the officers now holding the offices of \nCollector of Customs, Attorney-General and prosecuting attorney for \nthose of the officials holding those offices at the date of the filing \nof the original complaint ; and except further that it adds the \nfollowing allegations:<br\/><blockquote>\"That each and every one of the \nvessels of the defendant company is dedicated and devoted to the \ncarriage of passengers between various ports in the Philippine Islands, \nand each of said vessels, on all of said voyages between the said ports,\n usually and ordinarily does carry a large number of such passengers.<br\/><br\/>\"That\n dynamite, powder, and other explosives are dangerous commodities that \ncannot be handled and transported in the manner and form in which \nordinary commodities are handled and transported. That no degree of \ncare, preparation and special arrangement in the handling and \ntransportation of dynamite, powder and other explosives will wholly \neliminate the risk and danger of grave peril and loss therefrom, and \nthat the highest possible degree of care, preparation and special \narrangement in the handling and transportation of said commodities is \nonly capable of reducing the degree of said danger and peril. That each \nand every one of the vessels of the defendant company is wholly without \nspecial means for the handling, carriage, or transportation of dynamite,\n powder and other explosives and such special means therefor which would\n appreciably and materially reduce the danger and peril therefrom cannot\n be installed in said vessels without a cost and expense unto said \ncompany that is unreasonable and prohibitive.\"<\/blockquote>As we read \nthem, the allegations of the original complaint were intended to raise \nand did in fact raise, upon demurrer, a single question which, if ruled \nupon favorably to the contention of plaintiff, would, doubtless, have \nput an end to this litigation and to the dispute between the plaintiff \nstockholder of the steamship company and the officials of the Philippine\n Government out of which it has arisen.<br\/><br\/>In their brief, counsel \nfor plaintiff, in discussing their right to maintain an action for a \nwrit of prohibition, relied upon the authority of <i>Ex parte<\/i> Young \n(209 U. S. [123] 163, 165), and asserted that: <br\/><blockquote>\"Upon the\n authority, therefore, of <i>Ex parte<\/i> Young, <i>supra<\/i>, the \nmerits of the question pending between petitioner and respondents in \nthis action is duly presented to this court by the complaint of \npetitioner and general demurrer of respondents thereto. That question, \nin plain terms, is as follows:<br\/><br\/>\"Is the respondent Yangco \nSteamship Company legally required to accept for carriage and carry 'any\n person or Property offering for carriage?'<br\/><br\/>\"The petitioner \ncontends that the respondent company is a common carrier of only such \narticles of freight as they profess to carry and hold themselves out as \ncarrying;\" and in discussing the legal capacity of plaintiff to maintain\n this action, counsel in their printed brief asserted that \"here we have\n no address to the court to determine whether a minority or a majority \nshall prevail in the corporate affairs; here we ask plainly and \nunmistakably who shall fix the limits of the corporate business\u2014the \nshareholders and directors of the corporation, or certain officials of \nthe government armed with an unconstitutional statute?\" <br\/>\n<\/blockquote>Counsel for plaintiff contended that under the guaranties \nof the Philippine Bill of Rights a common carrier in the Philippine \nIslands may arbitrarily decline to accept for carriage any shipment of \nmerchandise of a class which it expressly or impliedly declines to \naccept from all shippers alike; that \"the duty of a common carrier to \ncarry for all who offer arises from the public profession he has made, \nand is limited by it;\" that under this doctrine the respondent steamship\n company might lawfully decline to accept for carriage \"dynamite, powder\n or other explosives,\" without regard to any question as to the \nconditions under which such explosives are offered for carriage, or as \nto the suitableness of its vessels for the transportation of such \nexplosives, or as to the possibility that the refusal to accept such \narticles of commerce in a particular case might have the effect of \nsubjecting any person, locality or the traffic in such explosives to an \nundue, unreasonable or unnecessary prejudice or discrimination: and in \nline with these contentions counsel boldly asserted that Act No. 98 of \nthe Philippine Commission is invalid and unconstitutional in so far as \nit announces a contrary doctrine or lays down a different rule. The \npleader who drew up the original complaint appears to have studiously \navoided the inclusion in that complaint of any allegation which might \nraise any other question. In doing so he was strictly within his rights,\n and having in mind the object sought to be attained, the original \ncomplaint is a model of skillful pleading, well calculated to secure the\n end in view, that is to say, a judgment on the precise legal issue \nwhich the pleader desired to raise as to the construction and validity \nof the statute, which would put an end to the controversy, if that issue\n were decided in his favor.<br\/><br\/>Had the contentions of plaintiff as \nto the unconstitutionality of the statute been well founded, a writ of \nprohibition from this court would have furnished an effective and \nappropriate remedy for the alleged wrong. The issue presented by the \npleadings on the original complaint, involving a question as to the \nvalidity of a statute and affecting, as it did, the shipping and public \ninterests of the whole Islands, and submitting no complicated question \nor series of questions of fact, was of such a nature that this court \ncould not properly deny the right of the plaintiff to invoke its \njurisdiction in original proceedings. We deemed it our duty therefore to\n resolve the real issue raised by the demurrer, and since we were of \nopinion that the contentions of counsel for the plaintiff were not well \nfounded, and since a ruling to that effect necessarily resulted in an \norder sustaining the demurrer, we did not deem it necessary or \nprofitable to consider questions of practice or procedure which it might\n have been necessary to decide under a contrary ruling as to the \nprincipal question raised by the pleadings; nor did we stop to consider \nwhether the \"subject matter involved\" in the controversy might properly \nbe submitted to the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, because upon \nthe authority of <i>Ex parte<\/i> Young (<i>supra<\/i>) we were satisfied \nas to the jurisdiction and competency of this court to deal with the \nreal issues raised by the pleadings on the original complaint, and \nbecause, furthermore, the Act of the Philippine Legislature creating the\n Board of Public Utility Commissioners could not deprive this court of \njurisdiction already invoked in prohibition proceedings instituted for \nthe purpose of restraining the respondent officials of the Government \nfrom the alleged unlawful exercise of authority under color of an \ninvalid statute and without jurisdiction in the premises.<br\/><br\/>The \namended complaint, however, presents for adjudication in original \nprohibition proceedings in this court questions of a wholly different \ncharacter from those submitted in the original complaint.<br\/><br\/>In so \nfar as it reiterates the allegations of the former complaint to the \neffect that the respondent officials are unlawfully coercing the \nsteamship company by virtue and under color of the provisions of an \ninvalid or unconstitutional statute, it is manifest, of course, that the\n amended complaint is no less subject to criticism than was the original\n complaint. If, therefore, the action can be maintained upon the amended\n complaint it must be maintained upon its allegations that those \nofficials are coercing the company to carry explosives on vessels which,\n as a matter of fact, are not suitably equipped for that purpose, and \nwhich from the nature of the business in which they are engaged should \nnot be required to carry expldsives.<br\/><br\/>It will readily be seen, \nunder our former opinion, that these allegations raise no question as to\n the validity or constitutionality of any statute; that the real \nquestion which plaintiff seeks to submit to this court in original \nprohibition proceedings is whether the respondent officials of the \nGovernment are correctly exercising the discretion and authority with \nwhich they have been clothed; and that his contention in the amended \ncomplaint is not, as it was in the original complaint, that these \nofficials are acting without authority and in reliance upon an invalid \nand unconstitutional statute, but rather that they are exercising their \nauthority improvidently, unwisely or mistakenly.<br\/><br\/>Under the \nprovisions of sections 226 and 516 of the Code of Civil Procedure \njurisdiction in prohibition proceedings is conferred upon the courts \nwhen the complaint alleges \"the proceedings of any inferior tribunal, \ncorporation, board, or person, whether exercising functions judicial or \nministerial, were without or in excess of the jurisdiction of such \ntribunal, corporation, board or person.\" It is manifest therefore that \nthe allegations of the amended complaint, even if true, will not sustain\n the issuance of a writ of prohibition without further amendment unless \nthey be construed to be in effect a charge that the respondent officials\n are abusing the discretion conferred upon them in the exercise of their\n authority in such manner that the acts complained of should be held to \nbe without or in excess of their jurisdiction.<br\/><br\/>It may well be \ndoubted whether the doctrine of the case <i>Ex parte<\/i> Young (<i>supra<\/i>),\n relied upon by the plaintiff in his argument in support of the original\n complaint, can properly be invoked in support of a right of action \npredicated upon such premises; so also, since the acts complained of in \nthe amended complaint are alleged to have been done at a date subsequent\n to the enactment of the statutes creating the Board of Public Utility \nCommissioners, it may well be doubted whether the courts should \nentertain prohibition proceedings seeking to restrain alleged abuses of \ndiscretion on the part of officers and officials of the Government, and \nof public service corporations with regard to the rules under which such\n corporations are operated, until and unless redress for the alleged \nwrong has been sought at the hands of the Board.<br\/><br\/>We do not deem \nit expedient or necessary, however, to consider or decide any of these \nquestions at this time, because we are of opinion that we should not \npermit our original jurisdiction to be set in motion upon the \nallegations of the amended complaint.<br\/><br\/>It is true that this court \nis clothed with original jurisdiction in prohibition proceedings (sec. \n516, Act No. 190). But this jurisdiction is concurrent with the original\n jurisdiction of the various Courts of First Instance throughout the \nIslands, except in cases where the writ runs to restrain those courts \nthemselves, when of course it is exclusive; and we are satisfied that it\n could not have been the intention of the legislator to require this \ncourt to assume original jurisdiction in all cases wherein the plaintiff\n elects to invoke it. Such a practice might result in overwhelming this \ncourt with the duty of entertaining and deciding original proceedings \nwhich from their nature could much better be adjudicated in the trial \ncourts; and in unnecessarily diverting the time and attention of the \ncourt from its important appellate functions to the settlement of \ncontroversies of no especial interest to the public at large, in the \ncourse of which it might become necessary to take testimony and to make \nfindings touching complicated and hotly contested issues of fact.<br\/><br\/>We\n are of opinion and so hold that unless special reasons appear therefor,\n this court should decline to permit its original jurisdiction to be \ninvoked in prohibition proceedings, and this especially when the \nadjudication of the issues raised involves the taking of evidence and \nthe making of findings touching controverted facts, which, as a rule, \ncan be done so much better in the first instance by a trial court than \nan appellate court organized as is ours.<br\/><br\/>Spelling on Injunctions \nand Other Extraordinary Remedies (vol. 2, p. 1493), in discussing the \ncases in which the appellate courts in the United States permit their \noriginal jurisdiction to be invoked where that jurisdiction is \nconcurrent with that of some inferior court, says:<br\/><blockquote>\"Of \nthe plan of concurrent jurisdiction West Virginia may be taken as an \nillustration. The Supreme Court of Appeals of that State has concurrent \noriginal jurisdiction with the circuit courts in cases of prohibition, \nbut by a rule adopted by the former court it will not take such original\n jurisdiction unless special reasons appear therefor.\"<\/blockquote>We \ndeemed it proper to assume jurisdiction to adjudicate and decide the \nissues raised by the rulings on the original complaint, involving as \nthey did a question as to the validity of a public statute of vital \ninterest to shippers and ship owners generally as also to the public at \nlarge, and presenting for determination no difficult or complicated \nquestions of fact: but we are satisfied that we should decline to take \njurisdiction of the matters relied upon in the amended complaint in \nsupport of plaintiff's prayer for the writ.<br\/><br\/>The question of the \nconstruction and validity of the statute having been disposed of in our \nruling on the demurrer to the original complaint, it must be apparent \nthat if the allegations of the amended complaint are sufficient to \nmaintain the plaintiff's action for a writ of prohibition, a question as\n to which we expressly reserve our opinion, the action should be brought\n in one of the Courts of First Instance.<br\/><br\/>Twenty days hereafter \nlet the complaint be dismissed at the costs of the plaintiff, unless in \nthe meantime it is amended so as to disclose a right upon the part of \nthe plaintiff to invoke the original jurisdiction of this court without \nfirst proceeding in one of the Courts of First Instance.\u00a0 So ordered.<br\/><br\/><i>Arellano,\n C.

JUAN MAQUI, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S IO N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The appellant in this case was convicted in the court below of the theft of a \ncaraballa and her calf, and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of five \nyears, to suffer the accessory penalties prescribed by law, and to pay his share \nof the costs of the proceedings.\n<p>Counsel for the accused contends that the trial court erred in giving \nprobative value to the testimony of one Dagsa, the principal witness for the \nprosecution; in accepting proof as to certain extrajudicial admissions alleged \nto have been made by the accused, including an offer to compromise the case by \nthe payment of a sum of money; and in declining to accept as true the testimony \nof the accused in his own behalf at the trial. We find nothing in the record, \nhowever, which would justify us in disturbing the findings of the trial judge as \nto the degree of credit which should be accorded the various witnesses called at \nthe trial.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel rests his contention that the evidence as to the extrajudicial \nstatements made by the accused should have been excluded on the ground that, as \ncounsel insists, there is no formal proof in the record that they were made \nvoluntarily, and that they were therefore inadmissible as proof in so far as \nthey can be construed as admission or confessions of guilt. In answer to this \ncontention it is sufficient to say that there is no suggestion in the record in \nthe court below that these extrajudicial statements were not made voluntarily, \nand we are satisfied that if the evidence as to the circumstances under which \nthese incriminating statements were made be accepted as true it clearly rebuts \nthe possibility that they were made involuntarily, or extorted by force, \nthreats, or promise of reward. The record clearly discloses that these \nextrajudicial statements were made in the course of offers to compromise and \nthat they were made by the accused voluntarily, though doubtless these offers to \ncompromise were made in the hope that if accepted he would escape \nprosecution.<\/p>\n<p>The question as to the admissibility of offers to compromise in criminal \ncases has frequently been discussed in the courts of the United States, and the \npractice there does not appear to be wholly uniform. We think, however, that the \nweight both of authority and of reason sustains the rule which admits evidence \nof offers to compromise, but permits the accused to show that such offers were \nnot made under a consciousness of guilt, but merely to avoid the in convenience \nof imprisonment or for some other reason which would justify a claim by the \naccused that the offer to compromise was not in truth an admission of his guilt \nand an attempt to avoid the legal consequences which would ordinarily ensue \ntherefrom.<\/p>\n<p>Satisfaction to the owner of the goods stolen is admissible, as evidence \nagainst the accused, but if made merely to avoid the inconvenience of \nimprisonment, and not under a consciousness of guilt, it is not evidence. (U. S. \n<em>vs.<\/em> Hunter, 1 Cranch, C. C, 317.)<\/p>\n<p>In a prosecution for seduction, evidence that the accused had sought an \nadjustment with the prosecutrix is inadmissible, if such offer of adjustment did \nnot contain an admission of guilt. (Wilson vs. State, 73 Ala., 527.)<\/p>\n<p>On a prosecution for assault with intent to commit rape upon a married woman, \nevidence is admissible on behalf of the prosecution to show that the defendant \nsent a third person to the father of the prosecutrix to ascertain if the case \ncould be compromised. (Barr <em>vs.<\/em> People, 113 111., 471.)<\/p>\n<p>In a larceny case, evidence is not admissible to show that defendant stated \nthat he would pay $50 if it could be settled, in reply to threats by the owner \nof the goods stolen that he would be prosecuted for damages, and a solicitation \nto settle. (Frain<em> vs.<\/em> State, 40 Ga., 530.)<\/p>\n<p>In a prosecution for larceny, evidence is not admissible that defendant paid \na sum of money in settlement of a civil action brought to recover the property \nalleged to have been stolen. (State <em>vs.<\/em> Emerson, 48 Iowa, 172.)<\/p>\n<p>An offer of compromise, voluntarily made by the accused, without threat or \npromise, and the reply thereto, are admissible in evidence upon his trial for a \ncrime. (State <em>vs.<\/em> Bruce, 33 La. Ann., 186.)<\/p>\n<p>An offer of compromise of a crime, unaccepted by the prosecutor, may be \nproven by the state as an admission of guilt, or as disclosing possession of the \nproperty which is the subject of the burglary and larceny charged in the \nindictment (State <em>vs.<\/em> Rodrigues, 45 La. Ann., 1040; 13 Southern, \n802.)<\/p>\n<p>It may be shown that the prisoner sent a message to the prosecutor, proposing \nto take a whipping and to be let go. (State <em>vs.<\/em> DeBerry, 92 N. C., \n800.)<\/p>\n<p>We are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, \nbut we are of opinion that in imposing the penalty the trial court should have \ntaken into consideration as a mitigating circumstance the manifest lack of \n\"instruction and education\" of the offender. It does not clearly appear whether \nhe is or is not an uncivilized Igorot, although there are indications in the \nrecord which tend to show that he is. But in any event, it is very clear that if \nhe is not a member of an uncivilized tribe of Igorots, he is a densely ignorant \nand untutored fellow, who lived in the Igorot country, and is not much, if any, \nhigher than are they in the scale of civilization. The beneficent provisions of \narticle 11 of the Penal Code as amended by Act No. 2142 of the Philippine \nLegislature are peculiarly applicable to offenders who are shown to be members \nof these uncivilized tribes, and to other offenders who, as a result of the fact \nthat their lives are cast with such people far away from the centers of \ncivilization, appear to be so lacking in \"instruction and education\" that they \nshould not be held to so high a degree of responsibility as is demanded of those \ncitizens who have had the advantage of living their lives in contact with the \nrefining influences of civilization.<\/p>\n<p>It is true that this court has quite uniformly held that convicts of the \ncrimes of theft and robbery are not entitled to the benefits of the provisions \nof article 11 of the Penal Code prior to its amendment by Act No. 2142, this on \nthe theory that under the provisions of the article prior to its amendment the \nground upon which the courts were authorized in their discretion to mitigate the \npenalties prescribed by the code was \"the circumstance of the offender being a \nnative, mestizo, or Chinese.\" As to crimes of this nature we declined to hold \nthat the mere fact that one is a native of the Philippine Islands, a mestizo or \na Chinese would justify a claim that upon conviction of crimes such as theft or \nrobbery he should be treated more leniently than the members of any other race \nor people, no sound presumption arising from the mere racial affiliation of the \nconvict that he was less able to appreciate the criminal character of such \noffenses or to resist the temptation to commit them than are they.<\/p>\n<p>Under the provisions of the article as amended by Act No. 2142, the ground \nupon which the courts are authorized to mitigate the1 prescribed penalties is \nnot the racial affiliation of the convict, but \"the degree of instruction and \neducation of the offender;\" and while mere ignorance or lack of education will \nnot always be sufficient to justify the mitigation of the prescribed penalties \nfor crimes such as theft and robbery, there can be no doubt that cases may and \nwill arise wherein under all the \"circumstances attending\" the commission of \nthese offenses the exercise of a sound discretion will justify a more lenient \ntreatment of an ignorant and semicivilized offender, than that which should be \naccorded one who has had the advantage of such a degree of instruction and \neducation as would justify the court in believing that he was capable of fully \nand properly understanding and appreciating the criminal character of the \noffense committed by him.<\/p>\n<p>We conclude, therefore, that under the provisions of article 11 as amended by \nAct No. 2142, the courts may and should, even in cases of theft and robbery, \ntake into consideration the lack of instruction and education of the offender \nwhere it appears that under all the circumstances attending the commission of \nthe offense, he should not be held to the strict degree of responsibility \nprescribed in the code for the ordinary offender.<\/p>\n<p>The larceny was of large cattle and falls within articles 517, 518, and 520 \nof the Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 2030. According to those sections, as \namended, the value of the animals stolen being 650 <em>pesetas,<\/em> a penalty \none degree higher than <em>arresto mayor <\/em>in its medium degree to \n<em>presidio correctiona<\/em>l in its minimum degree should have been imposed; \nin other words, <em>presidio correctional<\/em> in its medium degree to presidio \nmayor in its minimum degree. Giving the convict the benefit of the provisions of \narticle 11 of the Penal Code, as amended, this penalty should be imposed in its \nminimum degree\u2014that is to say, the penalty applicable in this case is that of \n<em>presidio correctional<\/em> in its medium degree.<\/p>\n<p>Modified by imposing the penalty prescribed for the offense of which the \ndefendant and appellant was convicted in the minimum degree\u2014that is to say, by \nimposing upon the accused the penalty of two years four months and one day of \n<em>presidio correctional,<\/em> in lieu of that of five years' imprisonment \nimposed by the court below\u2014the judgment convicting and sentencing him should be \nand is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the \nappellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

She was the \nowner through purchase from the spouses Martin Magahis and Severina Dignasan for \nthe price of P70, as is recorded in the instrument executed therefor, which is \nin every way valid. Jose Mojica, son of Paula Martinez, sold said lot to \nVictorino Baganus for the same price, P70, on March 15, 1909, as is likewise \nrecorded in the instrument executed therefor, also in every way valid.\n<p>On May 22, 1913, Paula Martinez sought recovery of ownership and possession \nof the lot, previously requesting that the sale thereof made by Jose Mojica to \nVictorino Baganus be declared null and void.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant Baganus alleged that he bought the lot from Jose Mojica with \nthe consent of the latter's mother, Paula Martinez, in the belief that it \nbelonged to Jose Mojica and that the money with which the latter had bought it \nhad been earned by Jose when he was the patron of a sailboat; that he had paid \nto Paula Martinez a deposit of P30 in advance and agreed to pay the P40 balance \nwhen the instrument of sale had been executed, as was later done; that confiding \nin good faith in the validity and efficacy of his acquisition, he had made \nnecessary and useful improvements on the lot, having built a house and a \ncarriage shop thereon, graded it, and planted fruit trees, all which had cost \nhim over P1,000.<\/p>\n<p>Jose Mojica, 40 years of age, confirmed the sale he had made to Baganus for \nthe price of P70, having received P30 in advance and P40 later when the sale was \nput on record; but he says that he made the condition that if his mother did not \nagree to the sale he might take back the land and would return the money \nreceived; and that in fact his mother did not agree to it. Upon being asked why \nhis mother had not for four years exercised the right of action she was now \nexercising in the face of Baganus' refusal to, return the land, he replied that \nhe did not know why his mother had not done so immediately; that he had always \nbeen a farmer, and never the patron of any sailboat; that Baganus resided near \nthe lot under consideration.<\/p>\n<p>Concepcion Mojica, 36 years of age, another child of Paula Martinez, confirms \nthe sale of the lot made by her brother Jose. She says that her mother ceased to \npossess the lot four years ago, and two years ago she, the witness, talked with \na lawyer in order to find some way to arrange the matter or to repurchase the \nland, in view of the fact that her mother was not in accord with the sale made \nby her brother.<\/p>\n<p>Filomena Tolentino was presented as a witness to testify that Jose Mojica \nmade the condition that the sale should not be carried out if his mother did not \nagree to it; but this witness, who says she was a pupil of Jose Mojica's in \n1911, likewise says that before 1911 she had been in Mojica's house and heard a \nconversation between Mojica and Baganus before and after the signing of the \ninstrument of purchase (which was in 1909). To each of them she ascribed words \nthat suit the case.<\/p>\n<p>Maria Alicante was also presented as a witness to prove that Paula Martinez \nhad paid a certain married couple as if to say that this was not the money of \nany patron of a sailboat. <\/p>\n<p>Victorino Baganus affirms that he arranged the sale with Paula Martinez and \npaid her in advance P30. He said that the value of the improvements were: For \nconstruction of the house, P1,000; for the warehouse, P80; and for the fruit \ntrees planted, P300, although they had not yet borne fruit. The only thing \nimpugned is the planting of the trees; counsel for the plaintiff only \nacknowledged the grading of the land or lot in question.<\/p>\n<p>This case was tried by the justice of the peace of the capital of Batangas, \nby delegation from the Court of First Instance of the province. He decided it by \ndeclaring null and void and of no force or effect the sale made by Jose Mojica \nto Victorino Baganus and sentenced the latter to return the lot claimed to Paula \nMartinez, to remove at his own expense the buildings and plants he had placed \nthereon, and to pay the costs; without prejudice to the right of action he had \nagainst Jose Mojiea, which was reserved, on the ground of ejectment.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant assigned as errors to the judgment:<\/p>\n<p>(1) Trial of this case by the justice of the peace who decided it when he \nlacked jurisdiction and competency therefor; (2) declaration .that the lot in \nlitigation belongs to Paula Martinez; (3) declaration that the defendant \nacquired the land in bad faith; and (4) the order for the defendant to return \nthe lot claimed and to remove the buildings and plants he had placed \nthereon.<\/p>\n<p>There is no ground for sustaining the first, second, and third assignments of \nerror. The justice of the peace delegated was completely vested with the \nnecessary competency and jurisdiction. The subject matter of the litigation, \nsince the price of the sale did not exceed W0, and the value of the improvements \nclaimed only amounts altogether to P1,380, the total of these sums is within the \nprovisions of section 1 of Act No. 2131. It is evident, and this was not \nimpugned at the trial, that the lot in litigation is the property of the \nplaintiff; and the defendant acquired it in bad faith, for he himself says that \nhe dealt with the plaintiff, but consented that one who was not the owner of the \nthing sold should appear as the vendor.<\/p>\n<p>The fourth assignment of error is sustained. Even though the defendant built \nand planted in bad faith, the plaintiff also acted in bad faith:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Bad faith On the part of the owner is understood whenever the act (of \nbuilding or planting) has been executed in his presence with his knowledge and \ntolerance and without objection.\" (Civil Code, art. 364 par. \n2.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Concepcion Mojica, plaintiff's daughter, two years after the sale made the \nproposition, in talking with a lawyer for the purpose, that the land be \nrepurchased .All were present and were living in the barrio, the mother and her \ntwo children.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When there has been bad faith, not only on the part of the person who built, \nsowed, or planted on another's land, but also on the part of the owner thereof, \nthe rights of each shall be the same as if both had acted in good faith.\" (Civil \nCode, art. 364, par. 1.)<\/p>\n<p>\"The owner of the land on which building, sowing, or planting is done in good \nfaith shall have the right to appropriate as his own the work, sowing, Or \nplanting after the indemnity mentioned in articles 453 and 454, or, to oblige \nthe person who has built or planted, to pay to him the value of the land. * * \n*.\" (Civil Code, art. 361.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Articles 453 and 454 mentioned concede the right of retention to the \npossessor in good faith (as the defendant now is) who may have made necessary \nand useful improvements on another's property.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed in so far as the sale of the lot \nclaimed is thereby declared null and void and of no force and effect, with the \ncosts in first instance; and there is reserved to the defendant his right of \naction against Jose Mojica to warrant the sale; but it is reversed in so far as \nit orders the defendant to deliver to the plaintiff the lot claimed in the \ncomplaint and to remove therefrom at his own expense the buildings and sowings \n(plantings, not sowings) he placed thereon.<\/p>\n<p>In lieu thereof, we hold that the plaintiff should recover the lot under \nconsideration, first indemnifying the defendant for the value of the buildings \nand plantings he has placed thereon, with the right on his part to retain it \nuntil she has reimbursed him for said necessary and useful improvements; or in \nthe contrary case, for the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the price of the \nland, making himself the legitimate owner thereof; without special finding as to \nthe costs in this instance.

In case his application should not be proper under the \nLand Registration Act he laid claim to the benefits of Chapter VI of Act No. \n926, especially as he had been in possession of the land since 1911, having \nbuilt a fence around it and used it for the cultivation of rice and garden truck \nfor more than a year.<\/p>\n<p>On April 3, 1913, counsel for Felix de la Cruz objected in writing to the \nforegoing application, alleging that the lot indicated by the letter A in the \nplan ought not to be registered, as the applicant claims, because he is the \nabsolute and exclusive owner thereof; and he prays that the application and \nregistration be denied with reference to the lotmarked \"A.\"<\/p>\n<p>After trial of the case on the same date and examination of the evidence \nadduced by the parties, together with the documents exhibited, the trial court \nrendered the judgment set forth. The respondent Cruz excepted thereto and prayed \nfor a reopening of the case and the holding of a new trial. This motion was \noverruled, with exception on the part of the respondent, whose counsel in due \ntime presented the corresponding bill of exceptions, requesting that the \ndocuments and evidence submitted at the trial form a part thereof, and, having \nbeen approved and certified by the court, it was forwarded with the record of \nthe case to the clerk of this court in virtue of the appeal filed.<\/p>\n<p>The opposition set up by Felix de la Cruz to the application for inscription \nin the property register requested by Guillermo de los Santos of land situate in \nApunan-auac, as hereinbefore set forth, is based on the improper inclusion of a \nportion of his land in the plan, Exhibit A, which is the lot indicated by the \nletter A on the western side of said tract. To this end the respondent presented \nat the hearing of the case the notarial document, Exhibit 1, executed on October \n7, 1904, and ratified under oath by the interested parties before a notary on \nthis same date. In this document it appears that the spouses Jose Torres \nPamintuan and Carmen Tizon sold absolutely to Felix de la Cruz a parcel of land \nsituate in Tibag or Dungan Tapayan, a place included in the municipality of \nBamban, Tarlac, of approximately 27 <em>balitas<\/em> in extent or area, bounded \non the north by the property of Fernando Manipun, on the east by Mariano Ocampo, \non the south by Alberto Rivera, and on the west by Basilio Macale.<\/p>\n<p>There can be no doubt that the respondent's land is bounded on the east by \nthat of the petitioner. <\/p>\n<p>It appears in the case that the petitioner Santos acquired his tract by \npurchase from the spouses Nicolas Maristela and Froilana Magtoto, who in turn \nhad acquired it from Mariano Ocampo; and that according to the notarial deed of \nsale executed by the spouses Torres and Tizon in favor of the purchaser Cruz the \nland acquired by the latter from them is bounded on the east by that of Mariano \nOcampo, the original owner of the land sold by him to the Maristela couple and \nafterwards purchased from them by the petitioner Santos; wherefore it is beyond \nall doubt that the petitioner's land is east of the respondent's, just as this \nis in turn situated.on the west of the said land of the applicant.<\/p>\n<p>These very important facts appear to be fully proven in the case, so, for the \nproper and just settlement of the controversy it is of the greatest importance \nto determine the boundary line between the two tracts, for according to the way \nthis is fixed so will it appear whether a certain portion of the land belonging \nto Felix de la Cruz was really included in the plan, Exhibit A, presented by the \npetitioner Guillermo de los Santos.<\/p>\n<p>The contention of the respondent Cruz that a certain portion of his tract was \nincluded in the plan prepared by the petitioner is confirmed by Isidro Ocampo, \nson of the original owner of the tract, Mariano Ocampo.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, this witness, as well as those of the petitioner, asserts that \nthe boundary line between the two tracts was the byroad that passes along the \nline drawn from Nos. 12 to 13 on the said plan. One of them, Pablo Rivera, added \nthat the land which now belongs to Felix de la Cruz was originally his fathers \nand passed to the spouses Domiciano Tizon and Dolores Singian, from whom Felix \nde la Cruz later acquired it. The byroad located on the line 12 to 13 of the \nplan, which separates the two tracts as a boundary line, does not at the present \ntime exist. The other witness, Nicolas Maristela, former owner of the \npetitioner's land, stated that while he was in possession of it he had had no \nquestion with any one over said boundary line, and pointed out that the land \nwhich had belonged to Singian is west of the old byroad, while the petitioner's \nland is east thereof. Although the respondent Cruz affirms that the boundary \nline between his land and the petitioner's runs along the dotted line 1 to 2, \nstill this affirmation does not appear to be supported by any evidence in the \ncase.<\/p>\n<p>In the face of such evidence, notoriously favorable to the petitioner, the \ntrial court held in the decision appealed from that the small excess, 70 ares in \narea, which is to be noticed in the application with reference to the area set \nforth in the petitioner's titles, can be attributed to defects incurred in \nmaking the old survey, and it is impossible to reject this finding when it is \nconsidered that the respondent did not present the plan of his land, wherein he \nmight have specified in detail the portion of the land of which he was deprived \nand which was unduly included in the petitioner's plan, nor has he proven the \nexact and true area of the part of his property he now claims; while it appears \nto be proven in the record that Guillermo de Los Santos is in possession of all \nthe land comprised in the plan A, including the part of the lot A in question, \nand therefore no legal ground exists whereby the respondent's claim can be \njustified, especially when it is impossible without good legal ground to set \naside the opinion formed by the trial court in passing upon the merits of the \nevidence adduced in the case by both parties. <\/p>\n<p>The respondent is also a claimant and as such cannot escape the obligation to \nprove the allegations contained in his exception to the application of the party \nwho alleges that he is the owner of the land sought to be registered, and if the \nrespondent Cruz has not succeeded in disproving with evidence the allegations of \nSantos, who has proved his ownership of the land, then the registration sought \nby the latter is proper under the law.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, whereby the errors assigned to the judgment \nappealed from are held to be refuted, affirmation of the same is proper, as we \ndo hereby affirm it; with the costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Some of the guests had already arrived in the yard by \n7 o'clock, and about five of them were in the house upstairs. Among these latter \nwas Agaton Salazar, who had gone there to assist the host in preparing the meal. \nShortly afterwards Pedro Reyes and Eulalio Cornejo arrived. These two men \ninduced a boy 12 years of age to call upstairs to Agaton Salazar and have him \ncome down. The boy did so and Agaton Salazar descended, holding his shirt in his \nhands and wearing a pair of wooden clogs. Pedro Reyes told Salazar that he \nneeded him and they, with the defendant, went aside to the south of the house. \nReyes led the way, Salazar followed him and behind the latter went Cornejo. \nAfter they had gone a few yards, Reyes, without saying a single word, turned \nhalfway around and struck Salazar a blow on the head with a <em>palma-brava<\/em> \nclub he was, carrying and immediately followed it up with two more blows. When \nSalazar stooped over, Cornejo struck him several blows in the face with a bolo, \nand then the two assailants immediately took to flight. Such was the uniform \ntestimony given by the owner of the house, Cabello, the boy aforementioned, \nnamed Eulalio Villamil, and Potenciano Lasala, all of whom were eyewitnesses to \nthe affair, which took place in the municipality of Taal, Province of \nBatangas.\n<p>According to the medical examination, the blow was inflicted with a \n<em>palma-brava<\/em> club with sharpened edges which fractured two bones in the \nfrontal parietal region and caused a very serious injury. The victim did not \nregain consciousness from the time he was struck until he died, six days \nafterwards, and the physician believed that this wound was the cause of his \ndeath. The examination further showed that the deceased received another wound \nin the cheek, not of a serious nature, caused by a cutting instrument, and still \nanother light one, likewise effected by means of a cutting instrument, which \nsplit his lips and an incisor tooth on the left side; finally, there were \nseveral bruises on the right wrist and the back of one of the forefingers, black \nand blue spots on the eyelids and both lips, and bleeding at the nose.<\/p>\n<p>Inocencio Aceron testified that on Sunday, November 2, 1913 (the day of the \noccurrence), he had left his house and his barrio about 8 o'clock in the morning \nin search of some cows and, while passing by the barrio of Halang of the same \nmunicipality of Taal, he saw Reyes and Cornejo, old acquaintances of his, in a \nshack. The former was engaged in putting an edge on the corners of a palma-brava \nclub, and the latter was sharpening a bolo. While witness was talking with them, \nthe idea occurred to him to ask why they were so busily engaged in that way, and \nthey replied that they were going to kill a bachelor of the barrio of Talon.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant admitted having been at the house of Zacarias Cabello because \nhe had been invited by one Primitivo Magsino, who also went there to escort his \nsister Maria back home. He heard, but did not see, the quarrel between Reyes and \nZalazar. He went home about 7 o'clock, but as his mother told him there was \nnothing to eat, he went to his uncle's house and there spent the night; the next \nday he went to Lipa. However, in his same testimony, defendant said that after \nthe quarrel between Reyes and Salazar he remained for an hour on the bench where \nhe was seated, without moving. Primitivo Magsino testified that five minutes \nafter Salazar entered the house, witness, his sister, the defendant, and a man \nnamed Vicente went away. Zacarias Cabello denied that either Primitivo or \nVicente had been at his house that night, though he asserted that Maria was \nthere and that he sent Potenciano Lasala to accompany her on her return home. \nThe defendant's mother told the policeman who was looking for him that night, \nthat he had not returned home. Cabello himself went to the house of the \ndefendant that night in order that they might arrest him, but neither then nor \non the following days could he be found there, nor in the field where he was in \nthe habit of working before the crime was committed.<\/p>\n<p>The Court of First Instance of Batangas tried and sentenced the defendant for \nmurder, and stated that he had not the least doubt of his guilt. He classified \nthe crime as murder \"because the killing of Agaton Salazar was attended by the \ntwo circumstances of treachery and deliberate premeditation, although one of \nthese is sufficient for the qualification of the said crime. The record \nsufficiently proves that there was treachery, for the defendant Eulalio. Cornejo \nand the fugitive Pedro Reyes attacked the deceased in a manner which he did not \nexpect and in such wise that he had no time to defend himself from their \nassault. It is also proven that there was premeditation, because, as above \nmentioned in the statement of facts, on the morning of the day of the \noccurrence, the defendant Eulalio Cornejo and Pedro Reyes prepared the weapons \nwith which they attacked the deceased that night.\"<\/p>\n<p>Of the two qualifying circumstances mentioned, one was held to be a generic \naggravating circumstance which should increase the penalty; but it was offset by \nthe extenuating one of article 11 on account of the defendant's lack of \neducation. Eulalio Cornejo was accordingly sentenced to seventeen years four \nmonths and one day of <em>cadena temporal,<\/em> to the accessory penalties, to \npay an idemnity of P1,000 to the heirs of the deceased, and the costs.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant appealed. After a consideration of his appeal, we find that the \nevidence was duly weighed in accordance with the merits of the case, and that \nthe finding of the qualifying circumstance of treachery was proper. There was \ntreachery if the attack was sudden and unexpected and not preceded by a dispute \nand the deceased was unable to prepare himself for his defense, though he was \nface to face with his assailant. (Decisions of November 16 and 23, 1900; \nNovember 21, 1901; and May 20, 1903.)<\/p>\n<p>We also find that the aggravating circumstance of deliberate premeditation \nwas also properly taken into account in accordance with the law. When, besides \ntreachery, there is premeditation, the latter constitutes an aggravating \ncircumstance. (Decision of May 9, 1877). This circumstance must be considered \nwhen the crime was planned by the guilty party, when he prepared beforehand the \nmeans which he deemed suitable for carrying it into execution, and when he had \nhad sufficient time dispassionately to consider and accept the consequences. \n(Decisions of Dec. 26, 1887, and Sep. 1, 1893.) There is premeditation when \nthere appears to have been a concerted plan to commit the crime (decision of \nJune 4, 1874), as, in the case at bar, where Reyes immediately preceded the \ndeceased and the defendant followed him, the victim being thus caught between \ntwo well-aimed blows.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the opinion of the trial judge is in line with the principles of \npenal sanction in finding that the defendant was guilty as a principal and \nnothing else, although it was known that the death of the victim was due to \ndefinite action by the co-defendant For only where there has been no agreement \nto cause the harm produced can acts,, performed jointly, in common and \nsimultaneously, be separated and the respective parts be defined in a crime \nwhere one attacks with a club and the other wounds the victim with a cutting \nweapon; in such case there would clearly be two separate and distinct injuries. \n(Decision of January 11, 1905.) But when there was an understanding, all who \nparticipated in the preconcerted crime are liable for the means which each of \nthem employed to carry such crime into effect, and for the consequences thereof. \n(Decisions of December 24,1901; March 26,1903; March 22 and 30, and May \n31,1905.)<\/p>\n<p>The only modification to be made in the sentence is the degree in which the \npenalty should be applied. The penalty being <em>cadena temporal<\/em> in its \nmaximum degree to death, it should be raised to that of death, by reason of the \ngeneric aggravating circumstance taken into account. Without this aggravating \ncircumstance the extenuating one of article 11 would reduce the penalty to the \nminimum degree, as it was in the sentence imposed; but, compensating this \nextenuating circumstance by that aggravating one, the penalty should be applied \nin the medium degree, or <em>cadena perpetua.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>With the understanding that the defendant is sentenced to <em>cadena \nperpetua,<\/em> the judgment appealed from is, in all other respects, affirmed, \nwith the costs of this instance against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson, Moreland, Trent,<\/em> and <em>Araullo JJ., \n<\/em>concur.<\/p>\n<p><br\/><\/p><\/div>",

From this judgment the defendant appealed, and thereupon the \nprovincial fiscal of Batangas and Mindoro filed a complaint before the Court of \nFirst Instance of the latter province, charging the said Bonifacio Garing with \nhaving placed, maliciously and criminally, on or about November 4, 1911, a fish \nweir in the Butas River of the township of Naujan, which device, though it faced \nthe sea, was arranged in such wise that it caught fish coming from the Naujan \nLake, all in violation of Municipal Ordinance No. 14 of the said township, \nseries of 1900.\n<p>The defendant having filed a demurrer to the complaint, on the ground that \nthe said ordinance was unconstitutional and therefore null and void, the court \nsustained the said demurrer by an order of March 12, 1912, the grounds and \ndespositive part of which are as follows :<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"* * * The prohibited district is the sea coast. The court has had occasion \nto examine cases relative to fisheries, on account of his having held the office \nof fiscal for several years, and to decide cases of this kind in his present \ncapacity of judge. At the present time there is no law in the Philippine Islands \nthat empowers municipal councils to prohibit fisheries, though they are \nauthorized to grant fishery licenses and privileges, but this is as far as their \npower in this respect extends. That a municipal council should prohibit fishing, \nand especially on the Naujan coast, in the sea, is something this court has \nnever seen nor heard of. Fishing in the sea is absolutely free, and a \nmunicipality may only regulate the same by granting a license for a certain \ndistrict or a privilege for such fishing. The court has duly considered the \nbrilliant arguments of the attorneys who have appeared in these two cases, and; \ndeciding both the latter at once, decrees their dismissal, with the costs <em>de \nofficio.<\/em> The court, at the same time, holds that the aforesaid ordinance is \nillegal and unconstitutional. So ordered.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>An appeal from the said order was taken by the fiscal, and, the case having \nbeen brought up to this court by a writ of mandamus issued to the said Court of \nFirst Instance on account of his refusal to allow the appeal, the said appeal is \nnow before us pending decision.<\/p>\n<p>The ordinance concerned in the order appealed from the Court of First \nInstance of Mindoro, reads as follows: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"An ordinance for the preservation of the fisheries of Butas and San Agustin \nRivers, which constitute a continuous source of revenue for the township of \nNaujan.<\/p>\n<p>\"Whereas, the practice of catching fish in large numbers on their way from \nLake Naujan to their spawning ground in the sea where they deposit their eggs \nhas led to a marked decrease in the number of fish taken annually in the Butas \nand San Agustin Rivers and will ultimately end in the destruction of the \nfisheries of these rivers, which form a continuous source of revenue for the \ntownship of Naujan: Now, therefore, Be it enacted by the council of Naujan \nthat:<\/p>\n<p>\"Article 1. On and after the 1st day of August, 1909, the construction of \nfish weirs, traps, or other devices of any description opening upstream or \ndesigned to catch fish running from Naujan Lake to deposit their eggs in the sea \nis hereby prohibited on the Butas and San Agustin Rivers between October 16 and \nFebruary 15. Traps and other devices may be placed in said rivers between \nOctober 16 and February 15 with their mouths opening downstream or in such a way \nas to catch fish coming up the river to Naujan Lake, but every such trap or \ndevice for catching fish shall have its openings at least 1 inch in diameter, \nand shall otherwise be so constructed that the passage of the young fish from \nthe sea to Lake Naujan may otherwise be unobstructed.<\/p>\n<p>\"Art. 2. On and after the 1st day of August, 1909, fish weirs, traps, and \nother devices may be placed in the Butas and San Agustin Rivers between February \n16 and October 15 with mouths opening upstream or designed to catch fish running \nfrom Lake Naujan to the sea. But every such trap or device for catching fish \nshall have its openings at least 1 inch in diameter and shall otherwise be so \nconstructed that the passage of the young fish from the lake to the sea will \nalways be unobstructed.<\/p>\n<p>\"ART. 3. The taking of fish known as banacs from the sea within the \njurisdiction of the township of Naujan between the mouth of the Nag-iba River \nand the point where the boundary line between Lake Naujan and Pola reaches the \nsea is hereby prohibited between October 16 and February 15. From February 16 to \nOctober 15 banacs may be taken from the sea within the jurisdiction of Naujan, \nbut all nets and other fishing devices used must have their openings at least 1 \ninch in diameter, and shall otherwise be so constructed that young fish can get \nthrough and will not be caught.<\/p>\n<p>\"Art. 4. Violators of this ordinance shall, upon conviction before a court of \ncompetent jurisdiction, be punished by a fine of P50 for the first offense, and \na fine of P10 for each subsequent offense, and in case of insolvency shall \nsuffer subsidiary punishment at hard labor in the municipal or provincial jail \nat the rate of one day's imprisonment for each peso of the \nfine.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From the text of the ordinance above quoted it is seen that by means thereof, \nthe municipal council of Naujan did nothing more than regulate the use and \nenjoyment of the right to fish in the Butas, San Agustin, and Nag-iba Rivers, by \ndesignating the seasons of the year when this right might be exercised and the \nmanner of so doing, in such wise that no detriment should thereby result to the \ndevelopment of the said industry and occasion a decrease in the number of fish \nascending the said rivers from the sea to Naujan and Pola Lakes or descending \nthem again, and by prescribing for this purpose the form of the fishing weirs or \ndevices which might be constructed in each of the said rivers in the respective \nseasons. It is logical that the regulations so established should imply the \nprohibition to exercise such a right in the seasons of the year not \nincluded.among those specified in the ordinance, and this very implication shows \nthat that right is not prohibited by them, but, on the contrary, is granted \nthrough means of the necessary regulation for the protection and improvement of \nthe said common property of the municipality of Naujan. Under this \nconsideration, it is very clear that it cannot be maintained that the said \nordinance is unconstitutional, and so much the less so in that, as appears from \nits very text, the alleged prohibited district mentioned in the order appealed \nfrom is not the seacoast as therein stated, for articles 1 and 2 of the said \nordinance refer to the construction of fish weirs, traps, or other devices in \nthe Butas and San Agustin Rivers, and article 3 thereof, though it speaks of the \ntaking of fish known as banacs from the sea, limits such fishing to the \nterritory comprised within the jurisdicition of the township of Naujan\u2014that is, \nto the area within which the municipal council of this township can exercise its \njurisdictional powers.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to the questioned validity of the said ordinance, it must be \nborne in mind that section 29 (<em>r<\/em>) of Act No. 1897, The Township \nGovernment Act, prescribes, among other duties of the township council, that it \nshall: \"Make such ordinances and regulations, riot repugnant to law, as may be \nnecessary to carry into effect and discharge the powers and duties conferred by \nthis Act, and such as shall seem necessary and proper to * * * promote the \nprosperity * * * for the protection of property * * * and enforce obedience \nthereto with such lawful fines or penalties as the council may prescribe under \nthe provisions of subsection (<em>q<\/em>) of this section.\"<\/p>\n<p>The same Act, in section 43, subsection (<em>a<\/em>), as amended by section 2 \nof Act No. 1689, provides, as one of the sources of revenue of the townships, \nthat these latter may collect fees for the granting of fishery privileges. This \nprovision clearly and explicitly gives it to be understood that the townships \nalso have the power to pass ordinances regulating fisheries or the exercise or \nenjoyment of the right to fish within their respective jurisdictions, for the \ngranting of such privileges or of the licenses required for those purposes must \nnecessarily be the subject matter of proper regulations, aside from the fact \nthat, since one of the means of furthering the prosperity and protecting the \ninterests and property of the municipalities or townships, which are also those \nof their inhabitants, is the adoption of rules that may conduce to the good use \nand adequate, proper, and regulated enjoyment of such interests and property, it \nmust be understood that power has been granted to the townships to pass \nordinances and provide regulations relative to fisheries or the exercise and \nenjoyment of the right to fish within their respective jurisdictional limits, \npursuant to the provisions of section 29, subsection (<em>r<\/em>), of Act No. \n1397, aforementioned. That such construction of the law with regard to townships \nis correct, it is sufficient to say that, although corporations both public, \namong which are municipalities; as well as private have those powers that were \nexpressly conferred upon them by the Act which created them, or, in the case of \nprivate corporations, by the Act under which they were organized, they also \nhave, pursuant to the general law on the matter (Act No. 1459, sec. 2), the \npowers incident to their existence\u2014that is, all such as have for their aim the \nrealization, fulfillment, and carrying out of the purposes for which such \ncorporations were created or organized, and others in relation to all matters \nwhich are or may be connected with those purposes, for such is the scope and \nimport of the words <em>incident to its existence,<\/em> contained in the \naforecited section 2 of the Corporation Law. And inasmuch as among those \npurposes, in respect to municipal councils of townships, are included all such \nas may conduce to securing the greatest sum of material good for the inhabitants \nof the township and their general welfare, through the improvement of the \nsources of wealth and production, the development of their properties and \nindustries and the creation of just and adequate taxes thereon, consequently \nalso the township of Naujan must have had power to pass the ordinance in \nquestion and this ordinance must be valid and legal.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons we revoke the order of dismissal appealed from and \noverrule the demurrer filed by the defendant against the complaint. The case \nwill be remanded to the court below for further proceedings.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Moreland, \nJJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/div>",

CO., LTD., DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an action to recover P1,915.30 damages alleged to have been caused by \nthe negligence of the defendant in handling the plaintiffs' baggage, whereby it \nfell into the sea and was injured or destroyed.\n<p>The plaintiffs were passengers on the steamer <em>St. Albans,<\/em> which, at \nthe time herein complained of, was the property of the defendant corporation and \nwas engaged in carrying freight and passengers between Shanghai, China, and \nManila, Philippine Islands. It arrived in Manila on the morning of the 7th of \nJanuary, 1913. Shortly after its arrival plaintiffs' baggage was taken out of \nthe hold of the ship for the purpose of being placed on the dock alongside of \nwhich the vessel was berthed. The baggage was placed in a sling, consisting of a \nsingle rope wound once around the trunks, and was swung from the side of the \nvessel. While still several feet above the wharf, the employee of the defendant \ncompany who was operating the winch, by some act or other, permitted the baggage \nto drop with great rapidity. In its passage downward it struck the side of the \nship with such force as to release it from the sling and it dropped into the \nwater alongside of the ship. The damages are stipulated at P1,188.<\/p>\n<p>The defendant, while admitting the damage caused to plaintiffs\u2019 baggage, \ndenied that it was the result of the company's negligence and set up as a \nspecial defense the limitation of liability established by the contract under \nwhich the defendant undertook to transport the plaintiffs from the city of \nHongkong to Manila.<\/p>\n<p>The record shows that on or about the end of December, 1912, the plaintiffs \nbought of the defendant's agent in Shanghai two first-class tickets for Manila, \nwhich entitled them to travel from Hongkong to Manila by the defendant's \nsteamship <em>St. Albans.<\/em> The tickets delivered to them were in English, \nwhich language plaintiffs read with ease and understand perfectly, and bore on \ntheir face, in large print, a statement that they were issued subject to the \nconditions printed on the back. One of these conditions, printed in legible \ntype, was as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This ticket is issued by the company and accepted by the passenger subject \nto the following conditions:<\/p>\n<p>\"The company will not hold itself responsible for any loss or damage \npassengers may sustain from the following causes: Prom advance in or delays \nafter advertised date of sailing, either through the performance of His \nMajesty's mail service or any other cause, from detention on the voyage, or at \nany of the intermediate ports, or through steamers not meeting, or delays from \naccident, from perils of the sea, or from machinery, boilers or steam, or from \nany act, neglect or default whatsoever of the pilot, masters, or mariners, nor \nfrom any consequences arising from any sanitary regulations or precautions which \nthe company's officers or local government authorities may deem necessary. <\/p>\n<p><em>\"Personal baggage.<\/em>\u2014In order to insure as far as possible the safe \ncustody of luggage, passengers should personally see their luggage delivered on \nboard. Each adult saloon passenger may carry, free of charge, but at his own \nrisk, 20 cubic feet of luggage; and each steerage passenger 10 cubic feet, under \nsimilar conditions (all in excess of these quantities must be paid for at the \ncurrent rate of freight); but the company will not hold itself responsible for \nany loss, or damage to or detention, or overcarriage of luggage, under any \ncircumstances whatsoever unless it has been booked and paid for as \nfreight.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>At the time the tickets were delivered to plaintiffs in Shanghai their \nattention was not especially drawn to the provisions on the back of the ticket. \nThe plaintiffs put their baggage on the <em>St. Albans<\/em> without paying for \nits transportation as freight and traveled with such baggage to Manila.<\/p>\n<p>The trial court's finding as to the negligence of defendant is based \nparticularly on the testimony of J. S. Stanley, Deputy Collector of Customs, and \nI. V. Chapman, chief wharfinger in charge of pier No. 5.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Stanley testified: \"While standing at the extreme end of Pier No. 5, I \nwitnessed a number of trunks being lifted from the deck of the steamship St. \nAlbans to an elevation of about 10 or 12 feet from the deck and practically the \nsame height above the pier. The winchman was instructed to let go. The sling \ndropped suddenly and was not checked at the proper time, and the sling of trunks \nstruck the side of the wharf, with the result that the trunks were forced from \nthe sling and fell into the water. It is customary to use a rope sling or a \ncargo chute running from the deck to the pier. The slings vary in size but are \nsufficiently large to contain a large number of trunks and are formed of ropes \nrunning in opposite directions forming a rope net. If these trunks had been in n \nrope sling they would not have fallen in the water.\"<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Chapman testified: \"When the steamship St. Albans came alongside the pier \nI took all her lines and berthed her in a position for the gangway and hatchways \nto work. Immediately after the ship was made fast I requested to be informed \nfrom the chief officer where the baggage would be discharged from; he told me \nhatch No. 4; I went to No. 4 hatch and asked the second officer who was there in \ncharge of the hatch where the baggage was to be discharged from; he said, 'Right \nhere indicating No. 4 hatch. I then told him I would have a chute there for him \nright away and he answered: 'All right.' I immediately went into the pier and \nordered one of the foremen and the men to take a chute to No. 4 hatch. I was \nfollowing with the foreman and behind the chute when Mr. Stanley informed me \nthat the baggage was over the side. The chute at this time was just through the \ndoor about 75 feet from the hatch. On arriving there I saw that the sling and \nthese trunks were all lying in the water. The stevedore had a lot of his men \nover the side picking up the trunks with the men from the pier helping.\"<\/p>\n<p>It is the contention of the defendant company that it is exempt from \nliability by virtue of the contract appearing on the tickets already referred to \nand quoted; as that contract was valid in the place where made, namely, the \nColony of Hongkong, and that that being the case, it will be enforced according \nto its terms in the Philippine Islands. It is also urged that it was not \nnecessary specifically to direct the attention of the passengers to the \nstipulations on the back of the ticket introduced in evidence.<\/p>\n<p>The evidence relative to the law governing these contracts in Hongkong \nconsists of the testimony of a Hongkong barrister, learned in the law of England \nand her colonies, and is to the effect that, under the law in force at the place \nwhere the contract was made, the contract was valid and enforceable, and that it \nis not necessary that the attention of persons purchasing tickets from common \ncarriers be drawn specially to the terms thereof when printed upon a ticket \nwhich on its face shows that it is issued subject to such conditions. The \nbarrister also testified that under the law of England and her colonies \neverything was done which was necessary to make the terms printed on the back of \nthe tickets a part of the contract between the parties.<\/p>\n<p>It is our conclusion that the judgment must be affirmed.<br\/><br\/>It is \nundoubted that the contract found upon the back of the tickets is a contract \nperfectly valid in England and her colonies and one which would be enforced \naccording to its terms in British jurisdictions. The question is what were its \nterms? It will be remembered that the contract provides \"the company will not \nhold itself responsible for any loss, or damage to or detention, or overcarriage \nof luggage, under any circumstances whatsoever, unless it has been booked and \npaid for as freight.\" Ordinarily this language would seem to be broad enough to \ncover every possible contingency, including the negligent act of defendant's \nservant. To so hold, however, would run counter to the established law of \nEngland and the United States on that subject. In the case of Price and \nCompany<em> vs.<\/em> Union Lighterage Company (King's Bench Division, 1903, Vol. \n1, pp. 750, 754), the court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"An exemption in general words not expressly relating to negligence, even \nthough the words are wide enough to include loss by negligence or default of \ncarriers' servants, must be construed as limiting the liability of the carrier \nas assurer, and not as relieving him from the duty of exercising reasonable \nskill and care.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The result of this decision seems to be that unless the contract of exemption \nspecifically refers to exemption for <em>negligence<\/em>, it will be construed \nas simply exempting the carrier from his liability as insurer, in other words, \nfrom his common law liability as carrier. This decision of the King's Bench \nDivision is supported by many authorities and apparently has never been \nquestioned. Among other references made in that case is that of Compania de \nNavegaci6n La Flecha <em>vs.<\/em> Brauer (168 U. S., 104), in which the opinion \nwas rendered by Mr. Justice Gray, who reviews with great thoroughness and \nerudition both the English and American authorities, many of which contain \nexemptions quite as comprehensive as those contained in the condition under \nwhich plaintiffs' baggage was accepted by the defendant in this case, such as \nthat the baggage \"was to be carried at the risk of the owner\" and that the \n\"carrier is not to be responsible for any loss under any circumstances \nwhatsoever.\" (See also Wheeler <em>vs.<\/em> 0. S, N. Co., 125 N. Y., 155; \nNicholas <em>vs.<\/em> N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 89 N. Y., 370.)<\/p>\n<p>The reasonableness of the strict rule of construction that the courts of \nEngland and of the State of New York apply to contracts restricting the \nliability of carriers with respect to their negligence is apparent when one \nconsiders that such contracts are held to be contrary to public policy and \ninvalid in the Federal courts and in most of the State courts of the Union. (The \nKensington, 183 U. S., 263.)<\/p>\n<p>In this connection, it may not be amiss to state that a critical examination \nof the deposition of Mr, Ernest Hamilton Sharpe, Master of Arts and Bachelor of \nCivil Law of the University of Oxford, Barrister at Law of London, Shanghai and \nHongkong, and King's Counsel at the latter colony, does not disclose anything \ncontradictory to the rule just stated. Mr. Sharpens examination was confined to \nthe question of the validity of the contract indorsed upon plaintiffs' ticket \nexempting the defendant company from liability for damage to their baggage. In \nview of the accurate answers of the learned witness to the questions put to him \nas to the validity of the condition in question under English law, there is no \nreason to suppose that he would not have stated correctly the rule as to the \nconstruction of the condition had his attention been directed to that point. In \nany event, this court is not, by reason of the opinion expressed by an expert \nwitness, precluded from advising itself as to the common law of England. (Sec. \n302, Code of Civil Procedure.)<\/p>\n<p>The judgment is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C. J., Torres, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.<\/em>, \nconcur.<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/div>",

ARCADIO RAMIREZ AND MARIANO SERADOY, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>TRENT, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">An appeal by Arcadio Ramirez and Mariano Seradoy from a judgment of the Court \nof First Instance of the Province of Pangasinan convicting them of the theft of \nlarge cattle.\n<p>It is urged that the trial court erred: (1) in convicting the two accused \nbecause their counsel was not present during the time in which more than \none-half of the testimony was being taken (citing U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Gimeno, 1 \nPhil. Rep., 236, and U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Palisoc, 4 Phil. Rep., 207); and (2) in \nconvicting these two appellants because the evidence introduced was not \nsufficient with respect to the appellants to establish their guilt beyond a \nreasonable doubt.<\/p>\n<p>The record shows that the appellants were arraigned on August 5, 1913, and \npleaded not guilty; that the court appointed Mr. Denison counsel <em>de \noficio<\/em>; and that Denison did not arrive until after the examination of the \nfirst witness and the direct examination of the second witness had terminated. \nBut the appellants interposed no objection to proceeding with the trial in the \nabsence of their counsel. Mr. Denison had an opportunity to cross-examine both \nwitnesses after his arrival.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Gimeno, supra, the court said: \n\"Upon an examination of the record we discover that the defendant applied to the \nCourt of First Instance for assignment of counsel for his defense at the trial \nof the case, and in accordance with the application an attorney was assigned for \nhis defense. Notwithstanding this, it seems that the attorney failed to appear \nat the trial to represent him, and the burden fell upon him to make his own \ndefense. Under General Orders, No. 58, if the defendant appears without counsel \nhe must be informed by the court that he has a right to have counsel before \nbeing arraigned, and must be asked if he desires the aid of counsel. If he \ndesires and is unable to. employ counsel the court must assign counsel to defend \nhim. (Sec. 17.) This is a right which the defendant should not be deprived of, \nand the failure of the court to assign counsel or, after counsel has been \nassigned, to require him to perform this duty by appearing and defending the \naccused would be sufficient cause for the reversal of the case. For this reason \nit will be necessary to remand this case for a new trial, at which the defendant \nmust be assigned counsel for his defense.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the case of United States <em>vs.<\/em> Palisoc, supra, the court said: \n\"The provisions of sections 16, 17, and 18 of General Orders, No. 58, are \nmandatory in their terms, and for the reason that the court did not comply with \nthe provisions of these sections, the judgment of the court with reference to \nRufino Lavarias is hereby reversed, and the cause is remanded to the Court of \nFirst Instance of the Province of Pangasinan for the purpose of a new \ntrial.\"<\/p>\n<p>We do not now question the correctness of the doctrine enunciated in these \ntwo cases. In the cause at bar the court complied with the-provisions of section \n17 of General Orders, No. 58, by appointing Mr. Denison to defend the appellants \nand requiring him to appear and perform the duty assigned to him. It is true as \nbefore stated that Mr. Denison was not present when the trial began but he \nappeared later and took charge of the defense. If it were error for the court to \ncommence the trial in the absence of counsel this was cured by the latter's \nsubsequent appearance, who had an opportunity to cross-examine the two \nwitnesses. This case is therefore clearly distinguishable from the case of \nUnited States <em>vs.<\/em> Gimeno. In both counsel were appointed. In the one he \nappeared subsequent to the commencement of the trial and took charge of the \ndefense. In the other he did not appear at all.<\/p>\n<p>In regard to the appellants' contention that the evidence is not sufficient \nto warrant their conviction, it is sufficient to state that if the evidence of \nrecord be given credence the appellants were properly convicted. The defense \nintroduced no evidence and made no effort to impeach the witnesses for the \nprosecution. There is no reason shown why the prosecution's witnesses should not \nbe believed. The positive and direct testimony of these witnesses stands \nuncontradicted. The guilt of the appellants has been established beyond \nquestion. The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed, with costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The petition should be verified and should have attached to it such \naffidavits as the petitioner may deem necessary for the substantiation of the \nallegations set forth in the petition. The present proceeding is by motion and \nthe moving papers are not verified.<\/p>\n<p>The power to appoint a receiver is a delicate one and should be exercised \nwith extreme caution and only under circumstances requiring summary relief or \nwhere the court is satisfied that there is imminent danger of loss, lest the \ninjury thereby caused be far greater than the injury sought to be averted. The \ncourt should consider the consequences to all of the parties and the power \nshould not be exercised when it is likely to produce irreparable injustice or \ninjury to private rights or the facts demonstrate that the appointment will \ninjure the interests of others whose rights are entitled to as much \nconsideration from the court as those of the complainant. This being the case, \nthe papers upon which the petition for the appointment of a receiver are based \nshould be verified and should contain all the facts required to show a clear \nright to the relief.<\/p>\n<p>The question has not been raised or discussed whether this court has \nauthority to appoint a receiver in an action pending here on appeal. We do not, \ntherefore, decide that question. A majority of the court believe that whether \nthe court has that right or not, the result would be the same, as the motion \ncould not prevail in either event.<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that, although the case has been appealed and the \nappeal perfected, the Court of First Instance still has the power to hear and \ndecide an application for the appointment of a receiver. It may be contended \nagainst the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance that no action was \npending in that court to which the petition for the appointment of a receiver \ncould become ancillary and that an appeal from the original judgment to this \ncourt had been perfected, the allowance of the bill of exceptions having the \neffect to stay all further proceedings in the case. In reply to such contention \nwe might say that, although the cause has been appealed to the Supreme Court, it \nmay be regarded as yet pending for the purpose of an application for a receiver \nand we are of the opinion that the court that rendered the decree appealed from \nis the proper court to hear and determine such an application. The office of a \nreceiver is manifestly to aid, by the preservation of property, in making \neffective the court's decree.<\/p>\n<p>It has always been regarded as an auxiliary or ancillary proceeding and \nrarely, if ever, as an independent one. If occurrences arise after decree which \nthreaten the effectiveness of the decree, the court has the power then to make \nthe appointment. The questions raised on the appointment of a receiver do not \ninvolve any matter litigated by the appeal. (Brinkman <em>vs.<\/em> Ritzinger, 82 \nInd., 358; Chicago &amp; South-eastern Railway Co. <em>vs<\/em>. St. Clair, 144 \nInd., 371; Moran<em> vs.<\/em> Johnston, 26 Grat., Va., 108; Adkins <em>vs<\/em>. \nEdwards, 83 Va., 316.)<\/p>\n<p>Even though we held that this court has authority to appoint a receiver in an \naction pending on appeal, we should not exercise that authority under the facts \nand circumstances of this case. This court is not provided with adequate \nresources and machinery for dealing with the situation presented by the \nappointment of a receiver and all of the details connected therewith. It would \nimpose upon us obligations and duties which we are not fully prepared to \ndischarge and which we are not called upon to meet under the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to that portion of the motion asking for the issuance of an \nexecution, should the court refuse to appoint a receiver, we have to say:<\/p>\n<p>Section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Except by special order of the court, no execution shall issue upon a final \njudgment rendered in a Court of First Instance until after the period for \nperfecting a bill of exceptions has expired. But the filing of a bill of \nexceptions shall of itself stay execution until the final determination of the \naction, unless for special reasons stated in the bill of exceptions the court \nshall order that execution be not stayed, in which event execution may at once \nissue. But the court may require as a condition of a stay of execution that a \nbond shall be given reasonably sufficient to secure the performance of the \njudgment appealed from in case it be affirmed in part or \nwholly.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the case of Macke <em>vs.<\/em> Camps (5 Phil. Rep., 185), the court said: \n\"Thus the legislator has placed the issuance of the order complained of in the \ndiscretion of the trial court, and this court will not interfere to modify, \ncontrol, or inquire into the exercise of this discretion, which is thus \nconferred by statute, unless it be alleged and proven that there has been an \nabuse or excess of authority on the part of the trial judge, or unless it \nappears that since the issuance of the order conditions have so far changed as \nto necessitate the intervention of the appellate court to protect the interests \nof the parties against contingencies which were not contemplated by the trial \njudge at the time of the issuance of the order. (Jerome <em>vs.<\/em> McCarter, \n21 Wallace, 88 U. S., 17; Calvo <em>vs.<\/em> Gutierrez, 4 Phil. Rep., 203.)\"<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, even though this court has authority to issue an execution in an \naction pending on appeal, a question which we do not decide, we would not issue \nit in this case upon the showing made for the reasons expressed in the decision \nabove cited. No change in condition or circumstance has been shown since the \nexecution was stayed in the court below which would warrant our \ninterference.<\/p>\n<p>The reasons which lead to the denial of the motion to issue an execution also \nrequire the denial of the motion to require the defendant to give the bond \nmentioned in the moving papers. <\/p>\n<p>The motion must be denied in all its parts.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

que \nhabiendo notado la presencia del acusado, se aproximo a Marto y le pregunto \nquien era este, y Marto le contesto que era el llamado \"Poten\"; que a esto \nreplico que este \"Poten\" debe ser el mismo que agredio a Pioquinto; que cuando \ndijo estas palabras, el acusado estaba a una distancia de 5 metros detras de \nellos e indudablemente pudo oir aquella manifestacion, pues en seguida se le \nacerco y le dijo, - \"por que \"buscas aquello?\"1; que entonces se apeo de su \ncaballo y le contesto que no tenia ningun motivo para re\u00f1ir con el, puesto que \nno era ningun pariente de Pioquinto; que mientras tenia lugar esta conversacion, \nel acusado se apeo tambien de su caballo, que en aquella ocasion llevaba un bolo \ndesenvainado en la mano, por cuyo motivo, Marto se lo quito con el objeto de \nevitar disgustos; que inmediatamente el acusado le dio un pu\u00f1etazo en la boca \nque le hizo caer de bruces, y arrebato el bolo de las manos de Marto y le dio \ncon ello un tajo; que al ver que el acusado habia herido a Marto, trato de \nincorporarse para echarse a correr, pero el acusado noto su intencion y le dio \nun tajo en el antebrazo derecho y otro tajo en el muslo izquierdo, que le hizo \ncaer de nuevo; que en el estado de aturdimiento en que se encontraba despues de \nhaber recibido las heridas, oyo una voz que decia, \"no te eches a correr porque \nvamos a rematar\", y entonces se levanto y se echo a correr, pero un individuo le \npersiguio y le \"arremetio a cortaplumazos\" y entonces, para defenderse, arranco \nsu cortaplumas y con el le dio un cortaplumazo \"de dentro para fuera y de \nderecha a izquierda\"; que le obligo a dejarle continuar su carrera; que cuando \nel acusado se apeo de su caballo, sus compa\u00f1eros se apearon tambien, teniendo \ntodos abiertos sus cortaplumas; que durante el tiempo que estuvo curandose de \nsus heridas, no pudo dedicarse a sus trabajos de labranza y actualmente solo lo \npuede hacer con mucha dificultad; que no conoce personalmente al acusado, y el \ndia de autos fue la primera vez que le habia visto; que el bolo Exhibit \"A\" es \nel bolo que llevaba el dia de autos, y era el mismo bolo con que el acusado \nhirio a Marto y a el; que desde su casa, llevaba dicho bolo en la mano, \ndesenvainado; que la casa mas proxima al lugar del suceso es la de un tal Cili \nque esta a unos 250 metros de distancia; que en el dia de autos, Marto no \nllevaba consigo ningun arma; que el cortaplumas que llevaba en aquella ocasion \ntenia unos diez centimetros de longitud; que no se habia fijado sobre lo que \nhabia hecho su compa\u00f1ero Joaquin Cueto, desde que principio el altercado con el \nacusado, y ya no le vio despues.<\/p>\n<p>Joaquin Cueto, de 24 a\u00f1os de edad, declaro, que conoce al acusado solamente \nde cara y le vio por primera vez el dia de autos; que en dicho dia iba a caballo \nen direccion a su sementera en compania de Geronimo y Marto; que en la marcha, \ncomo tenian que pasar por veredas estrechas, el iba delante, Marto le seguia y \nGeronimo iba detras; que en un sitio del camino, oyo algunos golpes de tajos y \nvolvio la cara y vio a Geronimo a unas veinte brazas de distancia tendido de \nbruces sobre el suelo, y vio a Marto caido al suelo y defendiendose con los pies \ny manos de los tajos que le daba el acusado; que al priincipio quiso acercarse \npara prestar auxilio a sus compa\u00f1eros, pero como vio a los dos compa\u00f1eros del \nacusado que tenian sus cortaplumas abiertos, huyo de aquel sitio y dio cuenta \ndel suceso al teniente del barrio llamado \"Terio\", que ni el ni Marto llevaba \narma alguna en aquella ocasion.<\/p>\n<p>El Presidente de Sanidad arriba mencionado encontro que Geronimo Marasigan \ntenia dos heridas, una en el muslo izquierdo y otra cortante en el antebrazo \nderecho, que habia interesado los huesos de dicho antebrazo, la cual herida \ntardo en curarse 45 dias,. sin que el herido pudiera dedicarse a sus faenas \nordinarias durante este tiempo; que como consecuencia de esta herida en el \nantebrazo, Geronimo no ha perdido el uso de dicho miembro, pero este ha perdido \nbastante fuerza y no puede ser usado para trabajos pesados; que Marto \nMatanguihan tenia tres heridas, una cortante en la rotula derecha, otra cortante \ntambien en el tercio superior del antebrazo derecho, y otra en el muslo \nizquierdo; que la herida en la rotula derecha intereso y partio el hueso de esta \nregion y produjo la muerte del herido catorce dias despues; que la herida de la \nrotula no era mortal, pero ocasiono la muerte a consecuencia de una complicacion \nde septicemia que se presento seis despues del suceso; que la complicacion de \nsepticemia tuvo lugar, probablemente, debido a que el sitio donde cayo y estuvo \ntendido el occiso estaba cubierto de excrementos de animales; que la septicemia \nes una complicacion que suele presentarse en las heridas anfractosas de bastante \nprofundidad, y consiste en una fiebre alta, que se asemeja a los accesos \npalidicos; que en el dia del suceso tambien reconocio al individuo Teodoro \nMendoza,y encontro que este tenia un rasgu\u00f1o en la region superciliar derecha, \notro rasgu\u00f1o en la espalda, y una contusion en la region \"lumbar; que los \nreferidos rasgu\u00f1os apenas tenian un centimetro de longitud y demostraban haber \nsido ocasionados con un arma puntiaguda; que la contusion en la region lumbar \npudo haber sido causada por un golpe o por una pedrada; que las heridas de \nMarasigan y Matanguihan debieron haber sido causadas con un bolo o por otro \ninstrumento cortante.<\/p>\n<p>El acusado Potenciano Mendoza que declaro en el juicio presenta una version \ndistinta del suceso, version en que aparecen el y sus dos compa\u00f1eros como los \natacados por Geronimo Marasigan y los suyos. El movil de este ataque es el \nfactor mas importante para juzgar de una y otra version. Se instruyeron dos \nactuaciones preliminares en el Juzgado de paz de Lemery, unas las relativas a \nesta causa contra Potenciano Mendoza, y otras contra Geronimo Marasigan y otros. \nLa declaracion prestada por extenso en estas actuaciones preliminares es la \nsostenida por el acusado en este juicio: \"Al llegar nosotros, dice, en frente de \nellos, Geronimo dijo: 'alto', que nos detuvieramos, y yo me detuve y enseguida \nGeronimo se acerco a mi caballo y cogio la rienda y dijo que nosotros les \ndieramos a buenas nuestros caballos porque si no seria nuestro fin. Yo le dije \nque tuviera paciencia porque seria una gran deuda nuestra y que no podia dar los \ncaballos.<\/p>\n<p>Al contestar yo que no podia dar los caballos, me dio golpe de plano con su \nbolo que me acerto en el muslo derecho y me cai del caballo. Despues de \nlevantarme cogi otra vez la rienda de mi caballo y estuve hablando con el, que \ntuviera paciencia y no hiciera eso, y estuvimos asi parados teniendo en medio de \nnosotros el caballo. Entonces Geronimo mando a sus compa\u00f1eros, diciendo: 'hagan \nVds. apear a esos y amarrarlo'. Aquel mi compa\u00f1ero no ha sido ya amarrado sino \nque fue abrazado por uno que no esta aqui, y Joaquin enseguida corrio hacia \nTasio a quien cogio por el hombro y le dio un cortaplumazo. Habiendo ya caido mi \ncompa\u00f1ero y estando ya respirando dificilmente, el que estuvo abrazado con el se \nme acerco, porque Geronimo Marasigan le dijo: 'vente aqui, vamos a atacar \ntambien a este'. Cuando ellos se me acercaban con sus armas desenvainadas, yo \nles decia que tuvieran paciencia y Geronimo siguio dandome tajos y yo estuve \nretrocediendo, y como ellos me acometian creyendo que me iban a matar, yo abrace \na ellos y enseguida quite el bolo a Geronimo. Despues de haber yo quitado el \nbolo, segui retrocediendo y el otro seguia acometiendome a cortaplumazos. Poco \ndespues se acerco Geronimo con un cortaplumas abierto, y solo cese (empece) de \natacarle al ver abierto su cortaplumas. Estando los dos acometiendome y mientras \nestaba yo retrocediendo, poco despues Geronimo se sento y Mamerto tambien cayo \nsentado y yo retrocedi tambien. Cuando ellos ya no me acometian y ya estaban \ncaidos, yo fui a la carretera para buscar mi caballo y buscaba tambien a mi otro \ncompa\u00f1ero, porque no sabia donde fue. Marto fue el que habia sujetado a \nAnastasio.\"<\/p>\n<p>Teodoro Mendoza no declara de igual manera acerca del movil de la ri\u00f1a: este \ntestigo Se\u00f1ala como movil palabras retadoras del Marasigan, nada de proposito de \nrobar caballos, a las dos veces de proferidas aquellas palabras retadoras \nMarasigan le pego a Potenciano y de aqui la r\u00f1a.<\/p>\n<p>No niega el acusado haber herido a Marto y a Geronimo y resulta que ha sido \nprocesado por vagancia y por robo y lesiones contra ese llamado Pioquinto que \nsale a lucir en la declaracion del Geronimo.<\/p>\n<p>El Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Batangas condeno a Potenciano Mendoza como \nreo de los delitos de homicidio y lesiones a diez y siete a\u00f1os, cuatro meses y \nun dia de reclusion temporal, accesorias de ley, indemnizacion de mil pesos a \nlos herederos del occiso Marto Matanguihan y de cincuenta pesos al lesionado \nGeronimo Marasigan y en las costas. El Juzgado hace aplicacion indebida del Art. \n89 del Codigo penal, puesto que no se trata de un solo hecho que constituye dos \ndelitos o de dos de los cuales uno sea medio necesario para cometer el otro.<\/p>\n<p>Por el homicidio, sin circunstancias modificativas, el acusado debe ser \ncondenado, y le condenamos a catorce a\u00f1os, ocho meses y un dia de reclusion \ntemporal: y por el de lesiones, a un a\u00f1o y un dia.<\/p>\n<p>Se confirma la sentencia apelada, entendiendose de este modo la condena, con \nlas costas de esta instancia al apelante.<\/p>\n<p>Diez dias despues dictese sentencia, y a los diez de dictada devuelvase la \ncausa.<\/p>\n<p>Asi se ordena.<\/p>\n<p>Conformes:<\/p>\n<p><em>Gomes J., Johnson J., Carson J., Moreland J.,<\/em> and <em>Araullo \nJ.<\/em> <br\/><\/p><\/div>",

Antonino Ramos.\" <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Antonino Ramos was appointed judicial administrator of the estate of his \ndeceased father, Julian Ramos, and against him as such, and personally, in that \nspecial proceeding, Pedro Martinez filed suit for the fulfillment of that \nobligation, for Antonino Ramos alleged that by order of his father he had \ncontracted it, and that subsequently he had transferred to some of his coheirs \nthe business started with that money.<\/p>\n<p>But the committee of appraisal of the estate, in its report rendered on \nFebuary 9, 1912 decided that this was not a debt against the estate, but against \nthe heirs who had acknowledged it when presented to them. On March 7 of the same \nyear Antonino Ramos appealed from the decision of the committee; suit was \ninstituted in the Court of First Instance of Batangas and carried forward to \njudgment whereby he was sentenced to pay to the plaintiff the sum of 1,450 pesos \nMexican currency, reduced to its equivalent in conant at the rate of 30 per \ncent, the final rate fixed for the official exchange of the former money with \nthe latter, with legal interest from the filing of the complaint until total \npayment, and the costs, the estate of the deceased Julian Ramos being absolved \nfrom the complaint.

For having disallowed the plea of double jeopardy. <\/p>\n<p>\"3. For having convicted the accused and sentencing him as he was \nsentenced.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We do not believe that the conviction can stand. The information is based on \narticle 347 of the Penal Code which provides that \"any judge who shall knowingly \nrender an unjust decision against the defendant, etc.,\" shall be punished as \nprovided therein.<\/p>\n<p>As we said in the bribery case against the same accused, (<em>ante,<\/em> p. \n100), we do not know whether the decision rendered by the accused was an unjust \nor a just decision. Neither do we know whether it has been executed or not. In \nfact, the decision seems subsequently to have been set aside and the cause sent \nto the Court of First Instance for original action in the premises. 'What has \nbecome of the case, we do not know.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, it does not appear that the accused knowingly rendered an unjust \njudgment even if we concede that the judgment was unjust. The mere fact that the \ncourt may not have had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action does not \nnecessarily establish the fact that his judgment was unjust. He may have been \nhonestly mistaken with respect to his jurisdiction. In fact, this seems to have \nbeen precisely the case, for, on being informed of the existence of the law \ndepriving his court of jurisdiction in such cases, he immediately set aside his \njudgment of conviction and sent the case to the Court of First Instance for \ntrial.<\/p>\n<p>Without, therefore, referring to the effect, if any, which the decision of \nthe United States Supreme Court in the case of Alzua <em>vs.<\/em> Johnson (231 \nU.

Attached to said petition was a copy of \nall the proceedings had in the department of customs.<\/p>\n<p>To the said petition the Honorable Ramon Avancena, Attorney-General, \npresented an answer, in which he said, in part: \"That the right of the said Chua \nTan Ching to land, was inquired into by the duly authorized board of special \ninquiry, which board, after hearing the testimony and considering the evidence \nsubmitted by the applicant, rendered its decision refusing him the right to land \non the ground that it did not believe him to be the son of Chua Yeng, as \nclaimed; that he was a person of Chinese race who presented none of the required \nstatutory evidence of his right to enter the Philippine Islands.\"<\/p>\n<p>Upon the issue presented by said petition and answer, the lower court, \nwithout first determining whether or not there had been an abuse of authority by \nthe department of Customs, proceeded to take testimony upon the right of the \nsaid Chua Tan Ching to land and after hearing said testimony, found that the \nsaid Chua Tan Ching was the legitimate minor son of Chua Yeng and entered an \norder discharging him from the custody of the law and allowed him to enter the \nPhilippine Islands. Prom that decision the Attorney-General appealed to this \ncourt.<\/p>\n<p>It has been repeatedly decided that the right to determine, in the first \ninstance, whether or not a Chinese alien has a right to enter the United States \nor territories thereof to which the Chinese immigration laws have been extended, \nhas been conferred by law upon a branch of the executive department of the \nGovernment. The judicial department of the Government has no authority or right \nto intervene in determining the right of aliens to enter the Philippine Islands, \nexcept and until it has been proven and shown clearly that that branch of the \nexecutive department of the Government upon which the power to determine that \nquestion has been conferred by law, has abused its authority; in other words, \nuntil it is shown .that the customs authorities have abused their authority in \nrefusing Chinese aliens the right to land in the Philippine Islands, the courts \nare without authority to intervene. The decision of the customs authorities is \nfinal, unless it is shown that they have abused their authority. (Tan Chin Hin \n<em>vs.<\/em> Collector of Customs, 27 Phil. Rep., 521.) It has been frequently \nheld that if there is some proof supporting the conclusions of the department of \ncustoms denying a Chinese alien the right to enter, there has been no abuse of \nauthority. (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Williams, 189 Fed. Rep., 915; Tan Chin Hin \n<em>vs<\/em>. Collector of Customs, supra.) It has also been decided that the \ncustoms authorities act more or less as a jury in determining the facts in the \nFirst instance; that they have an opportunity to see and hear the witnesses, and \nthat they are under no obligation to believe the declarations of a witness, if \nhis manner or conduct during the examination is such as to cause them to \ndisbelieve him, even though his declarations are not disputed by any other \nwitness. , (Ekiu <em>vs.<\/em> U. S., 142 U. S., 651; Tan Chin Hin <em>vs<\/em>. \nCollector of Customs, <em>supra<\/em>.)<\/p>\n<p>In the present case we find a very marked conflict between the declarations \nmade by the said Chua Tan Chin and the declarations of his alleged father and \nhis alleged brother.<\/p>\n<p>Said conflict, in our opinion, was sufficient to justify the board of special \ninquiry and the Insular Collector of Customs as well, in disregarding their \ntestimony and disbelieving the same. The board of special inquiry in its first \ndecision said, among other things:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The alleged father, brother, and Chua Yan, a relative appeared in his \nbehalf. Their stories were so conflicting and the lie was passed so often, that \nthe board hardly knows whether to believe any of the testimony or disbelieve all \nof it. * * *<\/p>\n<p>\"The alleged father and both of the witnesses contradicted themselves so many \ntimes, especially the second witness, and both of the witnesses have admitted to \nhaving falsely testified under oath, and the discrepancies are so many and so \nplainly false, that the board believes it to be a fraudulent case to the core.\" \n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The board of special inquiry stated that there was no resemblance between the \nalleged son and, the alleged father. It has been decided that a physical \ncomparison may be made between a minor Chinese, an applicant for admission into \nthe territory of the United States, with his alleged father, and that said \ncomparison constitutes competent and material evidence, providing the fact of \nsuch comparison is made a part of the record. (<em>Ex parte<\/em> Choey Dee Ying, \n214 Fed. Rep., 873; 2 Wigmore on Evidence, sees. 1150-1154; <em>In re<\/em> \nJessup, 81 Cal., 408; 6 L. R. A., 594; Gilmanton <em>vs.<\/em> Ham, 38 N. H., \n108,113; Tan Beko <em>vs<\/em>. Collector of Customs, 26 Phil. Rep., 254; De la \nCruz <em>vs.<\/em> Collector of Customs, 26 Phil. Rep., 270.)<\/p>\n<p>It certainly can not be contended, however, under such comparison, that if \nthere is no resemblance between the alleged son and the alleged father, that \nthat fact alone would constitute sufficient proof to show that the alleged \nparentage did not exist. The mere absence of parental resemblance, in the face \nof other proof, would not be sufficient to declare that the parentage did not \nexist. If the courts should decide that lineage and legitimacy depended upon \nparental physiognomy or bodily marks of similarity, a great many people might be \ndeprived of their legal inheritance. Legitimacy can not depend wholly upon the \npresence or absence of parental similarity of physical appearance. Neither was \nit made the basis of the decision of the board of special inquiry.<\/p>\n<p>The record contains a number of exhibits. It does not appear Of record just \nhow said exhibits were made a part of the record. Exhibit A is a letter written \nby H. B. Mc-Coy, Insular Collector of Customs, on July 22,1913, directed to Mr. \nPetronilo Valenzuela, immigration broker, which letter was accompanied by ail \nalleged decision, signed with a rubber stamp by the name \"H. B. McCoy, Insular \nCollector of Customs,\" by which decision it appears that the Insular Collector \nof Customs had overruled the decision of the board of special inquiry and had \npermitted the said Chua Tan Ching to land, as the legitimate minor son of Chua \nYeng. It is neither alleged nor proved that said alleged decision had ever been \nrendered by the Insular Collector of Customs, in fact, the record shows that no \nsuch decision had been rendered. We find in the petition presented by the \nplaintiff a statement made by the plaintiff himself, that an appeal was duly \ntaken to the Insular Collector of Customs, who affirmed the decision of the said \nboard of special inquiry, constituted as above stated. No pretension was made in \nthe court below that the Insular Collector of Customs had reversed the decision \nof the board of special inquiry and had permitted the said Chua Tan Ching to \nland. In view of the fact that the plaintiff admits that the Insular Collector \nof Customs affirmed the decision of the board of special inquiry and denied the \napplicant the right to land, we are not disposed to discuss that question \nfurther.<\/p>\n<p>While the record contains much proof supporting the contention of the \nappellee, yet there was sufficient proof, or rather conflicting of proof, in our \nopinion, to justify the conclusions of the department of customs. That being \ntrue, there was no abuse of authority and the Court of First Instance was \nwithout jurisdiction to hear proof upon the question presented by the petition \nfor the writ of habeas corpus.<\/p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of First Instance is \nhereby reversed, and it is hereby ordered and decreed that Chua Tan Ching be \nremanded to the Insular Collector of Customs to be dealt with in accordance with \nhis decision of the 11th day. of March, 1914. And without any finding as to \ncosts, it is so ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

LUCIA DOMINGO, RESPONDENT AND APPELLEE.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Ilocos Norte denying the probate of a will.\n<p>The learned court below based its judgment upon three grounds. The\nfirst one was that, although the testator had signed by mark, it\nnowhere appeared in the will who had written the signature or that it\nhad been written at his request. The second, that the witness Antonino\nPandaraoan could not really have signed the attestation clause because,\nat the time it was executed, he was attending a session of the\nmunicipal council of Piddig as a member thereof. Third: That as to the\nother witness, Segundino Asis, the will mentioned and confirmed a sale\nof land to him by the testator, and he being thereby an interested\nparty his testimony could not be believed.<\/p>\n<p>We do not believe that any of the objections are well founded and\nthe judgment refusing its probate must, therefore, be reversed.<\/p>\n<p>Section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides in part:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"No will, except as provided in the preceding\nsection, shall be valid to pass any estate, real or personal, nor\ncharge or affect the same, unless it be in writing and signed by the\ntestator, or by the testator's name written by some other person in his\npresence, and by his express direction, and attested and subscribed by\nthree or more credible witnesses in the presence of the testator and of\neach other. * * *\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It is nowhere required, that, where the testator is unable to write,\nthe fact that his signature was written by some other person, at his\nrequest and express direction, should appear in the body of the will\nitself. In the case of Barut <em>vs.<\/em> Cabacungan (21 Phil. Rep., 461, 463) we held the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"From these provisions it is entirely clear that, with respect to the <em>validity<\/em>\nof the will, it is unimportant whether the person who writes the name\nof the testatrix signs his own or not. The important thing is that it\nclearly appears that the name of the testatrix was signed at her\nexpress direction in the presence of three witnesses and that they\nattested and subscribed it in her presence and in the presence of each\nother. That is all the statute requires. It may be wise as a practical\nmatter that the one who signs the testator's name signs also his own;\nbut that is not essential to the <em>validity<\/em> of the will.\nWhether one person or another signed the name of the testatrix in this\ncase is absolutely unimportant so far as the validity of her will is\nconcerned. The plain wording of the statute shows that the requirement\nlaid down by the trial court, if it did lay it down, is absolutely\nunnecessary under the law; and the reasons underlying the provisions of\nthe statute relating to the execution of wills do not in any sense\nrequire such a provision. From the standpoint of language it is an\nimpossibility to draw from the words of the law the inference that the\nperson who signs the name of the testator must sign his own name also.\nThe law requires only three witnesses to a will, not four.<br\/>\n<br\/>\n\"Nor is such requirement found in any other branch of the law. The name\nof a person who is unable to write may be signed by another, by express\ndirection, to any instrument known to the law. There is no necessity\nwhatever, so far as the validity of the instrument is concerned, for\nthe person who writes the name of the principal in the document to sign\nhis own name also. As a matter of policy it may be wise that he do so\ninasmuch as it would give such intimation as would enable a person\nproving the document to demonstrate more readily the execution by the\nprincipal. But as a matter of essential validity of the document, it is\nunnecessary. The main thing to be established in the execution of the\nwill is the signature of the testator. If that signature is proved,\nwhether it be written by himself or by another at his request, it is\nnone the less valid, and the fact of such signature can be proved as\nperfectly and as completely when the person signing for the principal\nomits to sign his own name as it can when he actually signs. To hold a\nwill invalid for the lack of the signature of the person signing the\nname of the principal is, in the particular case, a complete abrogation\nof the law of wills, as it rejects and destroys a will which the\nstatute expressly declares is valid.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The section above quoted also provides that \"the attestation clause\nshall state the fact that the testator signed the will, or caused it to\nbe signed by some other person, at his express direction, in the\npresence of three witnesses, and that they attested and subscribed it\nin his presence and in the presence of each other. But the absence of\nsuch form of attestation shall not render the will invalid if it is\nproven that the will was in fact signed and attested as in this section\nprovided.\"<\/p>\n<p>Not only does the attestation clause comply with the requirements of\nthis section, but it appears clearly proved in evidence that the name\nof the testator was signed by another person at his request and under\nhis direction and in his presence and in the presence of the witnesses\nto the will. Moreover, as appears from the last clause of the section,\nif the attestation clause is defective, or even absent, the will is\nnevertheless valid provided it is satisfactorily proved that it was in\nfact signed and executed as provided by law.<\/p>\n<p>As to the second objection, namely, that Antonino Pandaraoan could\nnot have signed the will as a witness thereto, as stated in the\nattestation clause, because he was attending a meeting of the municipal\ncouncil of Piddig at the time the will is alleged to have been\nexecuted, we believe this also to be without merit. It does appear in\nthe evidence of the opposition that the witness Pandaraoan was\nattending a meeting of the municipal council of Piddig from something\nlike 10 o'clock till 12.30 o'clock of the day on which the will was\nexecuted and that the will was executed sometime between 10 and 12\no'clock. Too much weight, however, can not be given to the testimony\nrelative to the precise time of the execution of the will. The barrio\nof Piddig is only a short distance from the house in which the will was\nexecuted and it would have taken but a short time to cover the\ndistance. The witness Pandaraoan himself testified directly and\npositively that, after having left the meeting,of the municipal\ncouncil, he went to the house of the testator by appointment and there\nsigned the will as stated in the attestation clause. He asserts that he\ncovered the distance on horseback. The other witnesses to the will\nsupport this declaration. Not only this, but the notary public who drew\nup the will and who translated it to the testator and who was present\nat the time of its execution, declared and testified that the witnesses\nwhose names appear upon the will were present at the time it was\nexecuted by the testator and that they signed the same at his request\nand in his presence and in the presence of each other. All of the\nwitnesses to the will unite in declaring that they were there present\nat the time the will was executed and that they signed as witnesses in\nthe presence of the testator and of each other. The mere fact that\nthere was a session of the municipal council of Piddig about the same\ntime that the will was executed is not necessarily conclusive against\nthe fact that ' Antonino Pandaraoan was present and signed as a\nsubscribing witness as he declares. Mistakes in time are easily made\namong witnesses who measure time not so much by clocks or watches as by\nthe sun. Antonino Pandaraoan testified that the municipal council began\nits session about 10 o'clock; that in order to attend the execution of\nthe will, as he had agreed with the notary public he would do, he was\nobliged to leave the session before it terminated; that he so left the\nsession, mounted a horse and arrived at the house of the testator at\nabout 12 o'clock, in time to take part in the execution of the will as\nstated in the attestation clause.<br\/>\n<br\/>\nWe do not believe that the clear and positive testimony of the\nwitnesses to the will and of the notary public is overcome by the\nevidence offered in opposition to the probate.<\/p>\n<p>As to the third ground upon which the court based its decision;\nnamely, that the will having mentioned and confirmed a sale of land, to\nSegundino Asis, one of the witnesses to the will, while not rendering\nthe will entirely invalid, throws great doubt upon the legality of its\nexecution and especially the testimony of said witness relating thereto.<\/p>\n<p>Section 622 provides:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If a person attests the execution of a will, to\nwhom or to whose wife or husband, or parent, or child, a beneficial\ndevise, legacy, or interest, of or affecting real or personal estate,\nis given by such will, such devise, legacy, or interest shall, so far\nonly as concerns such person, or the wife or husband, or parent or\nchild of such person, or anyone claiming under such person or such wife\nor husband, or parent or child, be void, unless there are three other\ncompetent witnesses to such will, and such person so attesting shall be\nadmitted as a witness as if such devise, legacy, or interest had not\nbeen made or given. But a mere charge on the real or personal estate of\nthe testator, for the payment of debts, shall not prevent his creditors\nfrom being competent witnesses to his will.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>As will readily be seen on reading this section, nothing in the will\nbefore us relative to the sale of land to Segundino Asis creates such\nan interest therein, as falls within the provisions thereof. Indeed, no\ninterest of any kind was created by the will in favor of Segundino\nAsis, nor did it convey or transfer any interest to him. It simply\nmentioned a fact already consummated, a sale already made. Even if,\nhowever, the will had conveyed an interest to Segundino Asis, it would\nnot have been for that reason void. Only that clause of the will\nconveying an interest to him would have been void; the remainder could\nhave stood and would have stood as a valid testament.<\/p>\n<p>We are confident from a thorough examination of the record that a\nfair preponderance of the evidence is in favor of the proponents, and\nthere being no legal impediment to the probate the court erred in\nrefusing it.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is hereby reversed and the cause remanded\nto the court whence it came with instructions to legalize and probate\nthe will in accordance with the petition.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Edward Cook.<\/p> <p>The complaint alleges that the plaintiff is the wife of Edward Cook; that she is the absolute owner of a piece of land situated in the district of Paco, city of Manila, 913 square meters in area, and that the same is registered in her name under the Torrens Law by certificate No. 130; that on the 15th of June, 1912, a judgment was entered against Edward Cook, plaintiff's husband, for the sum of P10,000 in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Rizal; that by virtue of said judgment an execution was issued on the 10th of July of that year and levied upon the land described in the complaint as belonging to the plaintiff and that the same was advertised for sale on the 8th of August at 9 o'clock in the morning. After other allegations appropriate to an action of this kind, plaintiff prays for an injunction permanently prohibiting the defendants from selling the said land.<\/p> <p>The Torrens title introduced in evidence by the plaintiff was obtained in June 1904 in the name of plaintiff's husband, Edward Cook. Later, and sometime in August of the same year, the husband, by an instrument in writing in the form and manner required by Act No. 496, transferred to the plaintiff the land in question. In 1911 the plaintiff's husband, Edward Cook, became indebted to Johnson, the plaintiff in the action referred to, in the sum of P10,000, the purchase price of certain lands. Judgment upon said indebtedness was procured in the year 1912 as aforesaid and a levy made upon the lands described in the complaint.<\/p> <p>It is claimed by the appellants that the so-called transfer from plaintiff's husband to her was completely void under article 1458 of the Civil Code and that, therefore, the property still remains the property of Edward Cook and subject to levy under execution against him.<\/p> <p>In our opinion the position taken by appellants is untenable. They are not in a position to challenge the validity of the transfer, if it may be called such. They bore absolutely no relation to the parties to the transfer at the time it occurred and had no rights or interests inchoate, present, remote, or otherwise, in the property in question at the time the transfer occurred. Although certain transfers from husband to wife or from wife to husband are prohibited in the article referred to, such prohibition can be taken advantage of only by persons who bear such a relation to the parties making the transfer or to the property itself that such transfer interferes with their rights or interests. Unless such a relationship appears the transfer cannot be attacked.<\/p> <p>So far as the record of this case demonstrates the property in question is owned by the plaintiff and is not subject to levy and sale under the execution in this case.<\/p> <p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellants.<\/p> <p><em>Arellano, C.

On the 31st \nof January, 1912, the bank petitioned the court in which the estate of \nCarranceja was pending to be allowed to intervene in the proceed ings for the \nsettlement of that estate in the place and stead of the widow, of whose interest \ntherein the bank was the owner.<\/p>\n<p>The appellant in this case presents, both in his printed record and in his \nbrief, as the only error the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The court erred in overruling the motion of the Bank of the Philippine \nIslands praying that the P45,000, or there-abouts, be made a part of the estate \nand that it be divided among the heirs and creditors thereof.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the printed record appears this statement on the part of the appellant, \ndirected to the clerk of the Supreme Court:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In conformity with the rule of the Supreme Court, we have the honor to send \nherewith the only error which is alleged as the basis of the appeal in the \nabove-entitled proceedings, and to inform you that the following documents found \nin the record are the only ones necessary for the determination of this \nappeal:<\/p>\n<p>\"1. The testimony of the witness Nemesio Reyes.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. The judgment of the Court of First Instance of the 2d of January, \n1907.<\/p>\n<p>\"3. The order of said court of the 20th of August, 1908.<\/p>\n<p>\"4. The order of the 24th of August, 1909, of the same \ncourt.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>From the record it appears that the judgment of the 2d of January, 1907, is \none of the Court of First Instance of Ambos Camarines, Hon. Grant T. Trent \npresiding, which decides that \"according to the evidence presented the \ncommission had no jurisdiction to approve the claim of $53,721.04 Mexican \nagainst this estate. This being the conclusion, it is not absolutely necessary \nto decide at this time whether or not the estate is responsible for all or part \nof the debt of P60,382.22 conant transferred by Francisco Reyes to the \nbank.\"<\/p>\n<p>The order of the 20th of August, 1908, is an order entered by the same court, \npresided over by the same judge, approving the final account rendered by the \nexecutrix of the estate, declaring who the heirs were and their respective \nshares, appointing Josefa Pavon guardian of certain minors, declaring that \nclaims not theretofore presented against the estate were barred, and naming \nthree commissioners to divide the estate among the persons entitled thereto. \nThis order set a date for a hearing upon the partition to be made by the \ncommissioners therein appointed.<\/p>\n<p>The order of the 24th of August, 1909, was one entered by the same court, \npresided over by the same judge. The questions presented on the motion in which \nthe order was entered were stated by the judge as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"1. Has the bank sufficient interest in the final settlement of this estate \nto authorize it to intervene in the same?<\/p>\n<p>\"2. Should the court approve the partition made by the \ncommissioners?\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In reference to the first question the court in the order referred to \nstated:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The judgment obtained by the bank against Josefa Pavon in the Court of First \ninstance of Manila, was not against the widow as administratrix of the estate of \nher deceased husband but was against her personally. The widow still had an \ninterest in the rights which were sold at public sale for the reason that she \ncould have redeemed them within a year, and as administratrix and guardian of \nthe minors she also had an interest in the partition of the property of the \nestate. The bank purchased at public sale and was declared the owner of all the \nright, title, and interest which the widow had in this estate; and I am of the \nopinion and decide that the bank has sufficient interest at the present time in \nthis estate to authorize it to appear and take part in the final settlement of \nthis estate notwithstanding the opposition of Mr. Manly, attorney for the widow \nwho is also the administratrix and guardian of the minors.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This order after again approving the accounts rendered by the administratrix \nordered a repartition of the property in accordance with the terms of the order \nand again set a future day upon which the partition would be brought up for a \nhearing.<\/p>\n<p>These are the only orders presented by the appellant as the basis of its \nappeal.<\/p>\n<p><br\/>In order to show that the appellant had no standing on this appeal, the \nappellee caused to be brought to this court a decision of the Court of First \nInstance of Ambos Camarines, Hon. P. M. Moir presiding, made and entered January \n31, 1912, in which that court, following, as it believed, a decision of the \nSupreme Court, found that the appellant bank had no interest which warranted it \nin intervening in the final settlement of the estate of Carranceja, deceased, or \nof taking any part in the partition of the property of that estate, or of \ndirectly receiving any of such property in such partition. So far as appears of \nrecord, this order was not appealed from and was not brought to this court. It \ncannot, therefore, be made the basis of a decision on this appeal. That being \nthe case, it determines adversely, so far as this appeal is concerned, the right \nof the bank to appear in the final settlement of the estate in question in place \nof Josefa Pavon, whose interest it had purchased. It can have, therefore, no \ninterest on this appeal in the determination of whether or not the partition was \nproperly made.<\/p>\n<p>The appeal is dismissed, with costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The complaint\nalleges that the estate of which plaintiff is administrator is\ninsolvent; that the property in question is claimed by the defendant by\nvirtue of an alleged sale made to her by plaintiff's intestate on\nFebruary 19,1906; and that the deed of sale was executed without any\nconsideration in fraud of the vendor's creditors, one of whom, the wife\nof the deceased, had obtained judgment against him for support, prior\nto the date of the alleged sale. Judgment was rendered in the court\nbelow in favor of the plaintiff, the trial judge being of opinion that\n\"the document of sale was only made out for the purpose of attempting\nto conceal the ownership of the property, to make it impossible for the\nwife of the deceased to collect the judgment she had obtained against\nhim, and that no consideration was ever given by the defendant for the\nbill of sale, and that she never became the owner of the property.\"\n<p>This action is in all respects identical with a former action\nbetween the same parties, except that in the present action it is\nalleged and proven that the estate of which plaintiff is administrator\nis insolvent, while in the former action that fact was not alleged in\nthe complaint nor proven at the trial. In the former action judgment\nwas rendered in favor of the plaintiff by the trial judge on\nsubstantially the same grounds upon which a like judgment is rendered\nin this case, but upon appeal to this court, that judgment was\nreversed, on the ground that \"there was a failure to prove fraud,\nvitiating the sale, the defendant having established the payment of an\napparently good consideration for the transfer;\" and on the further\nground that even if the court were precluded from examining the\ntranscript of the evidence and reversing the findings of fact by the\ntrial judge, because of certain technical defects touching its\ncertification, nevertheless the facts disclosed by an examination of\nthe pleadings and the findings of the trial judge were not sufficient\nto sustain his judgment, it not appearing there from that the\n\"plaintiff had no other remedy, or that there was a deficiency of\nassets,\" without proof of which the action could not be maintained.\n(Guash <em>vs.<\/em> Espiritu, 11 Phil.Rep., 184.)<br\/>\n<br\/> At the\ntrial of the case at bar, wherein the parties appear to have relied on\nthe same evidence as in the former case, except as to the new\nallegations of insolvency, a plea of <em>res adjudicata<\/em> was submitted by the defendant, and as we think, improperly overruled by the court below.<\/p>\n<p>The trial judge in his opinion says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It appears to me from the decision rendered in the\nformer action by the Supreme Court that all question with regard to the\ntransfer of this property has been definitely settled, and yet it may\nbe inferred from a portion of the decision that the transfer was in\nfraud of creditors, but that the plaintiff could not recover for the\nreason that he had not shown the estate which he was administering to\nbe insolvent: and thus considering the matter I conclude that the\nplaintiff, as administrator of the estate of Jose Jimenez y Mijares,\ndeceased, is entitled to the proceeds arising from the sale of the\nproperty, made by order of the court, for the reason that the attempted\nsale was in fraud of creditors and that no sale had ever really been\naccomplished, but that the property in question belonged to the estate\nof the deceased.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>We agree with the trial judge that \"all question with regard to the\ntransfer of this property has been definitely settled\" by the former\ndecision of this court, but we do not agree with him that any inference\nwhich may fairly be drawn from the reasoning of the opinion in that\ncase sustains his action in reopening the question thus settled.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment in the former case was based on two separate grounds.\nFirst, the \"failure to prove fraud vitiating the sale, the defendant\nhaving established the payment of an apparently good consideration;\"\nsecond, that even if the court conceded (which it did not) a contention\nthat it was precluded from the examination and review of the testimony,\nthe judgment could not be sustained for lack of allegations in the\npleadings or findings of fact as to a deficiency in assets, and the\nlack of another remedy. But an examination of the opinion clearly\ndiscloses that the court squarely held that the evidence of record\n\"failed to prove fraud vitiating the sale,\" and that holding is\nmanifestly conclusive of the present case, wherein, upon the identical\nrecord of the evidence taken in the former case, the trial judge finds\nthe existence of fraud vitiating the sale.<\/p>\n<p>It is true that in the former case the court pointed out that even\nhad the plaintiff made a showing of fraud he could not have recovered\nin that action for lack of proof that there was no other legal\nrecourse, but nothing that was said in this connection can be construed\nas reserving a right in the plaintiff to institute a new action wherein\nhe would be permitted to allege and prove that fact. On the contrary,\nthe discussion developed, at its conclusion, a reiteration of the\nholding set forth at the opening of the opinion, to the effect that\n\"there was a failure to prove fraud, vitiating the sale, the defendant\nhaving established the payment of an apparently good consideration for\nthe transfer.\"<\/p>\n<p>Let judgment be entered reversing the judgment entered in the court\nbelow, and dismissing the complaint filed in this action without day,\nwithout special condemnation of costs in this instance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The plaintiff's residence in Caloocan fronts on the street along which \ndefendant's tracks run, so that to enter his premises from the street plaintiff \nis obliged to cross defendant's tracks. On the night mentioned plaintiff drove \nhome in a calesa and in crossing the tracks to enter his premises the horse \nstumbled, leaped forward, and fell, causing the vehicle to strike one of the \nrails with great force. The fall of the horse and the collision of the vehicle \nwith the rails, resulting in a sudden stop, threw plaintiff from the vehicle and \ncaused the injuries complained of.<\/p>\n<p>It is undisputed that at the point where plaintiff crossed the tracks on the \nnight in question not only the rails were above-ground, but that the ties upon \nwhich the rails rested projected from one-third to one-half of their depth out \nof the ground, thus making the tops of the rails some 5 or 6 inches or more \nabove the level of the street.<\/p>\n<p>It is admitted that the defendant was negligent in maintaining its tracks as \ndescribed, but it is contended that the plaintiff was also negligent in that he \nwas intoxicated to such an extent at the time of the accident that he was unable \nto take care of himself properly and that such intoxication was the primary \ncause of the accident.<\/p>\n<p>The trial court held that both parties were negligent, but that the \nplaintiff's negligence was not as great as defendant's and under the authority \nof the case of Rakes <em>vs.<\/em> A. G. &amp; P. Co. (7 Phil. Rep., 359) \napportioned the damages and awarded plaintiff a judgment of P1,000.<\/p>\n<p>The question before us is stated by the defendant thus:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Accepting the findings of the trial court that both plaintiff and defendant \nwere guilty of negligence, the only question to be considered is whether the \nnegligence of plaintiff contributed to the 'principal occurrence' or 'only to \nhis own injury.' If the former, he cannot recover; if the latter, the trial \ncourt was correct in apportioning the damages.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The question as stated by plaintiff is as follows: \"The main question at \nissue is whether or not the plaintiff was negligent, and, if so, to what extent. \nIf the negligence of the plaintiff was the primary cause of the accident then, \nof course, he cannot recover; if his negligence had nothing to do with the \naccident but contributed to his injury, then the court was right in apportioning \nthe damages, but if there was no negligence on the part of the plaintiff, then \nhe should be awarded damages adequate to the injury sustained.\"<\/p>\n<p>In support of the defendant's contention counsel says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Defendant's negligence was it,s failure properly to maintain the track; \nplaintiff's negligence was his intoxication; the 'principal occurrence' was \nplaintiff's fall from his calesa. It seems clear, that plaintiff's intoxication \ncontributed to the fall; if he had been sober, it can hardly be doubted that he \nwould have crossed the track safely, as he had done a hundred times \nbefore.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>While both parties appealed from the decision, the defendant on the ground \nthat it was not liable and the plaintiff on the ground that the damages were \ninsufficient according to the evidence, and while the plaintiff made a motion \nfor a new trial upon the statutory grounds and took proper exception to the \ndenial thereof, thus conferring upon this court jurisdiction to determine the \nquestions of fact, nevertheless, not all of the testimony taken on the trial, so \nfar as can be gathered from the record, has been brought to this court. There \nseem to have been two hearings, one on the 31st of August and the other on the \n28th of September. The evidence taken on the first hearing is here; that taken \non the second is not. Not all the evidence taken on the hearings being before \nthe court, we must refuse, under our rules, to consider even that evidence which \nis here; and, in the decision of this case, we are, therefore, relegated to the \nfacts stated in the opinion of the court and the pleadings filed.<\/p>\n<p>A careful reading of the decision of the trial court leads us to the \nconclusion that there is nothing in the opinion which sustains the conclusion of \nthe court that the plaintiff was negligent with reference to the accident which \nis the basis of this action. Mere intoxication is not negligence, nor does the \nniere fact of intoxication establish a want of ordinary care. It is but a \ncircumstance to be corfsiclered with the other evidence tending to prove \nnegligence. It is the general rule that it is immaterial whether a man is drunk \nor sober if no want of ordinary care or prudence can be imputed to him, and no \ngreater degree of care is required to be exercised by an intoxicated man for his \nown protection than by a sober one. If one's conduct is characterized by a \nproper degree of care and prudence, it is immaterial whether he is drunk or \nsober. (Ward <em>vs.<\/em> Chicago etc., R. R. Co., 85 Wis., 601; H. &amp; T.

Co. <em>vs.<\/em> Drake, 33 Ill. \nApp., 114.)<\/p>\n<p>If intoxication is not in itself negligence, what are the facts found by the \ntrial court and stated in its opinion upon which may be predicated the finding \nthat the plaintiff did not use ordinary care and prudence and that the \nintoxication contributed to the injury complained of? After showing clearly and \nforcibly the negligence of the defendant in leaving its tracks in the condition \nin which they were on the night of the injury, the court has the following to \nsay, and it is all that can be found in its opinion, with reference to the \nnegligence of the plaintiff: \"With respect to the condition in which Mr. Wright \nwas on returning to his house on the night in question, the testimony of Doctor \nKneedler, who was the physician who attended him an hour after the accident, \ndemonstrates that he was intoxicated. * * *<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If the defendant or its employees were negligent by reason of having left \nthe rails and a part of the ties uncovered in a street where there is a large \namount of travel, the plaintiff was no less negligent, he not having abstained \nfrom his custom of taking more wine than he could carry without disturbing his \njudgment and his self-control, he knowing that he had to drive a horse and wagon \nand to cross railroad tracks which were to a certain extent dangerous by reason \nof the rails being elevated above the level of the street.<\/p>\n<p>\"If the plaintiff had been prudent on the night in question and had not \nattempted to drive his conveyance while in a drunken condition, he would \ncertainly have avoided the damages which he received, although the company, on \nits part, was negligent in maintaining its tracks in a bad condition for \ntravel.<\/p>\n<p>\"Both parties, therefore, were negligent and both contributed to the damages \nresulting to the plaintiff, although the plaintiff, in the judgment of the \ncourt, contributed in greater proportion to.the damages than did the \ndefendant.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As is clear from reading the opinion, no facts are stated therein which \nwarrant the conclusion ttiat the plaintiff was negligent. The conclusion that if \nhe had been sober he would not have been injured is not warranted by the facts \nas found. It is impossible to say that a sober man would not have fallen from \nthe vehicle under the conditions described. A horse crossing the railroad tracks \nwith not only the rails but a portion of the ties themselves aboveground, \nstumbling by reason of the unsure footing and falling, the vehicle crashing \nagainst the rails with such force as to break a wheel, this might be sufficient \nto throw a person from the vehicle no matter what his condition; and to conclude \nthat, under such circumstances, a sober man would not have fallen while a \ndrunken man did, is to draw a conclusion which enters the realm of speculation \nand guess work.<\/p>\n<p>It having been found that the plaintiff was not negligent, it is unnecessary \nto discuss the question presented by the appellant company with reference to the \napplicability of the case of Rakes vsi A. G. &amp; P. Co., above; and we do not \nfind facts in the opinion of the court below which justify a larger verdict than \nthe one found.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without special finding as to \ncosts.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Accordingly, on the day following, the will was \nreexecuted and all of the formalities required by law were observed.<\/p>\n<p>It is contended on the part of the appellants that the will was not executed \nin the manner required by law and that the testimony of the attesting witnesses \nwas not sufficiently uniform to demonstrate that all of the formalities required \nby law had been complied with.<\/p>\n<p>We are unable to agree with this contention. It appears clear from the \ntestimony of the attesting witnesses that the testatrix signed the will in their \npresence and that, at her request, each one of the witnesses in the presence of \nthe testatrix and of the other two attesting witnesses signed the will. This is \nall that the law requires and while there may be some hesitation in the \ntestimony of some of the witnesses, we are satisfied that the evidence, such as \nit is, taken in connection with the attesting clause attached to the will, which \nwas made and signed at the time the will was executed and which carries with it \nthe presumption of correctness, is sufficient to sustain the finding of the \ntrial court that the will was properly executed and should be probated.<\/p>\n<p>It is contended on this appeal that it is not an essential requisite of a \nwill that the testator sign it in the presence of the three attesting witnesses. \nWe are of the opinion that this contention is not sound. While the first part of \nsection 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not expressly require that the \ntestator sign the will in the presence of the attesting witnesses, the second \npart thereof does require that fact to appear in the attestation clause and this \ncourt has always held that such a requisite is essential to the due execution of \nthe will. The second part of section 618 provides that \"the attestation shall \nstate the fact that the testator signed the will, or caused it to be signed by \nsome other person, at his express direction, in the presence of three witnesses, \nand that they attested and subscribed it in his presence and in the presence of \neach other.\"<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the \nappellants.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

The plaintiff alleged that \nshe was the owner of said parcels of land and was entitled to the possession of \nthe same, together with damages amounting to P50, caused by the illegal \npossession of the defendant.\n<p>The defendant presented a general denial, together with a special defense. In \nher special defense the defendant alleged that she was the possessor and the \nreal owner of said parcels of land.<\/p>\n<p>After hearing the evidence, the Honorable Dionisio Chanco, judge, rendered a \njudgment in which he found that the plaintiff was the owner of one-half of said \nparcels of land, by inheritance, and directed the defendant to deliver the same \nto her, giving to the defendant the usufruct of one-third part of the said \none-half, in accordance with the provisions of article 838 of the Civil Code. \nFrom that decision of the lower court the defendant appealed to this court and \nmade several assignments of error.<\/p>\n<p>From an examination of the record brought to this court, it appears that the \nplaintiff is the mother-in-law of the defendant; that the husband of the \ndefendant was Genaro Corpus, the son of the plaintiff; that Genaro Corpus died \nin the month of September, 1911, and the present action was commenced on the \n29th of June, 1912. The husband of the plaintiff died some time before the \ncommencement of the present action.<\/p>\n<p>During the trial of the cause the plaintiff attempted to prove that said \nparcels of land had been given to Genaro Corpus as \"propter nuptias\" by her \nhusband, Alejo Corpus. The plaintiff also presented proof showing that the \nparcels of land had been given to Genaro Corpus by his grand mother, Cirila \nPizario. The record contains no explanation of this conflict in the proof on the \npart of the plaintiff. <\/p>\n<p>The defendant presented proof for the purpose of showing that said parcels of \nland had been given to her by her mother at or about the time of her marriage \nwith Genaro Corpus. The fact is, however, that Genaro Corpus and his wife, the \ndefendant, occupied the parcels of land during practically all of their married \nlife. The record also shows that Genaro Corpus, as early as 1906, had made a \ndeclaration of ownership of said parcels of land, for the purpose of taxation. \nWhile said declaration, of course, did not show that he was the owner, \nnevertheless, it sustains the proof presented by both parties, plaintiff and \ndefendant, that he was in possession of the same. The lower court, not being \nable to find from the proof adduced, in what manner Genaro Corpus and the \ndefendant came into the possession of said land, presumed that the parcels of \nland constituted \"bienes gananciales\" [conjugal property] and divided the land \nbetween the plaintiff and defendant, as above indicated. When it is shown that a \nhusband and wife occupy real property, as owners, during a portion of their \nmarried life, and the proof fails to show in what manner they became owners, it \nis perfectly proper for the courts to presume, in the absence of other proof, \nthat said property was acquired during their married life and therefore \nconstitutes \"bienes gananciales.\" Considering the property as \"bienes ganan \nciales,\" we find that the division made by the lower court was in accordance \nwith the facts contained in the record and with the law. The judgment of the \nlower court is therefore hereby affirmed with costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

From that judgment both the plaintiff \nand defendant appealed to this court.\n<p>The lower court ordered the execution of the judgment unless the defendant \nshould present a bond in the sum of P33,000. The bond was given. The appeal was \nperfected. The record was received in the office of the clerk of the Supreme \nCourt on the 8th day of June, 1914. The said bond, which was given by the \ndefendant-appellant to perfect his appeal from the judgment of the lower court, \nwas signed by one Emiliano Carruncho.<\/p>\n<p>On the 8th day of October, 1914, the said Emiliano Carruncho presented a \nmotion in this court, praying that the bond be canceled and that he be relieved \nfrom responsibility upon the same. Said motion was heard on the 19th day of \nOctober, 1914. The attorneys for the plaintiff and defendant, respectively, \nappeared and opposed the granting of said motion. Emiliano Carruncho did not \nappear at the hearing of said motion, personally or by attorney.<\/p>\n<p>Under these facts we have the question presented whether or not a person who \nhas signed an appeal bond for the purpose of preventing the execution of a \njudgment during the pendency of an appeal, can be relieved from liability upon \nit <em>by a motion<\/em>. A bond is a contract. It is a contract defeasable upon \ncondition subsequent. For example, it is a conditional promise (contract) by A \nto pay a sum of money, to do an act, or a forbearance, which promise may be \ndefeated by a performance by A of the condition. The promise imposes a penalty \nfor the nonperformance of the condition which is the real purpose of the \ncontract (bond). Liability attaches at once in case of a failure to comply with \nthe condition. A bond given for the purpose of perfecting an appeal and to \nprevent the execution of a judgment of the lower court, is a contract and is \njust as binding upon the parties, subject to the conditions named in it, as any \nother contract. The parties thereto have no more right to be relieved from \nliability upon such a contract ttian they have in any other contract, without \nperforming the conditions named. Relief from liability under a bond can only be \nhad in accordance with the methods and for the reasons provided for by law, by \nwhich they may be relieved in ordinary contracts. They must pursue the same \nmethods by which they may be relieved from liability under other contracts. The \nfact that an agreement existed (as is alleged in the present case, with the \nperson who was primarily obligated to perform the conditions of the bond) by \nwhich the surety was to be relieved at a certain time or upon certain \nconditions, which were not mentioned in the bond, is not sufficient to relieve \nhim from liability upon said bond, without the consent of the person for whose \nbenefit the bond was given.<\/p>\n<p>For the reasons above stated, the motion is denied.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Upon being \nsent up to the Supreme Court on appeal, they were entered in the docket as Nos. \n9609, 9610, and 9611.\n<p>These three actions were brought for three distinct crimes of theft of \ncarabaos, on three separate complaints, but it was agreed among the parties that \nthey should be heard together and that the same evidence should serve for each \nof the three prosecutions. This done, and there being only one trial, but one \njudgment was rendered for all three cases.<\/p>\n<p>Although these actions were joined, three records were made of them in this \ncourt and they were numbered separately as in the lower court.<\/p>\n<p>Case No. 9609 is for the theft which, according to the complaint, was \ncommitted on April 23, 1913, by the five defendants, who, with intent of gain, \nstole a carabao from Gertrudis Doliente, which was in charge of Pedro Sinuto, \nwas worth PI60, and was sold by them to Luisa Corpus.<\/p>\n<p>This crime was clearly proven by the testimony of the witnesses Pedro Sinuto, \nGertrudis Doliente, Francisco B. Peralta, the latter a Constabulary soldier, \nTomas Borja, and Luisa Corpus. The ownership of the animal was shown by the \ndocument Exhibit A. Pedro Sinuto, who took care of the animal on April 23,1913, \nat 9 o'clock of the next morning did not find it in the place where he had tied \nit Later he found the animal in the municipality of Mangatarem, Pangasinan, \nwhere it had been taken into custody and was held by the Constabulary, as the \nwitness Peralta testified, having been taken from the possession of Tomas Borja \nand his so-called wife, Luisa Corpus, facts which were corroborated by these \nlatter. Luisa Corpus testified that she bought the animal from Anastasio \nAvillar, who, on the occasion of this sale, was accompanied by Maximiano Niegos \nand was driving five other carabaos; and that, on three other occasions, \nAnastasio Avillar, Maximiano Niegos, and Pedro Niegos, and the last time Domingo \nVillar also, had gone to Mangatarem to sell carabaos. Pedro Sinuto recovered the \ncarabao. Its brands had been changed and Peralta testified that pne of its ears \nhad been split.<\/p>\n<p>Case No. 9610 is for the theft, charged to the said five defendants, of two \ncarabaos, a caraballa, and her calf, valued at ?550, the property of Francisca \nEspiritu, Faustino Delo, and Aniceto Pascua. This crime, committed on April 22, \n1913, was likewise proven.<\/p>\n<p>Bernardino Espiritu had in his possession a carabao beonging to his sister \nFrancisca that was valued at P150. He lost this animal and it was ;found by the \npolice of Mangatarem, as the chief, Juan Vinluan, testified. It was recovered by \nthe chief of police of Cuyapo, the place whence it had been stolen. The seizure \nof the carabao in Mangatarem was certified to by the two municipal treasurers \nwho successively had it in charge. Pedro Gonzalez bought it from Anastacio \nAvillar, Maximiano Niegos, and Pedro Niegos, and five days afterwards it was \nclaimed by Francisca Espiritu.<\/p>\n<p>Faustino Delo testified that one day in April, 1913, he lost a carabao that \nhe had bought for P195, and that it was afterwards found in the \n<em>presidencia<\/em> of Mangatarem with its brands changed. It was shown that \nPelagio Bajo had bought the animal from Anastasio Avillar, the latter being at \nthe time accompanied by Pedro Niegos and Maximiano Niegos, which facts were \ncorroborated by the above-mentioned witness, Pedro Gonzalez, who identified the \ncarabao from among those which during the trial were held in the lower part of \nthe municipal building, as being the one lost by Faustino Delo and bought by \nPelagio Bajo.<\/p>\n<p>Anastasio Pascua testified that he had in his care a caraballa belonging to \nhis father; that, in the month of April, 1913, it escaped from the yard of his \nhouse where it had been tied; that some time afterwards it was found by some \npolicemen and taken to the presidencia of Mangatarem, where he redeemed it; \nthat, upon finding the animal in the <em>presidencia,<\/em> he observed that it \nbore a new brand in addition to the two that it already had; that Exhibit E is \nthe certificate of ownership of the caraballa; and that the caraballa was worth \nP170. The municipal treasurer of Mangatarem stated that he had returned to \nAniceto Pascua the caraballa claimed by the latter.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the third complaint is for the theft of a carabao owned by Juan B. \nSantiago and worth P170 (case No. 9611). The allegations,of the complaint \ntherein are also clearly substantiated.<\/p>\n<p>Juan B. Santiago testified that, on March 19, 1913, a carabao belonging to \nhim disappeared from the place where it had been secured; that some time \nafterwards it was found by some policemen of Mangatarem and witness redeemed it \nfrom the <em>presidencia<\/em> of the said pueblo; that the said carabao was \nworth P170; that the documents Exhibits B, C, and D are the certificates of \nownership of the carabao that he had lost; and that the carabao in question was \nin the lower part of the court building on the day of the hearing; that its \nbrands corresponded to those appearing in the said documents and that they had \nnot been changed or altered. The loss of the animal in Cuyapo and its recovery \nin Mangatarem were certified by the respective chiefs of police of both \nmunicipalities and by the municipal treasurer of Mangatarem. This carabao was \nsold by Anastasio Avillar to Simplicio Pagtaconan.<\/p>\n<p>This carabao and the caraballa stolen from Anastasio Pascua were among the \nsix or seven carabaos which on different occasions Anastasio Avillar, \naccompanied by Pedro Niegos and Maximiano Niegos, took to Mangatarem to \nsell.<\/p>\n<p>The trial court acquitted Domingo Avillar and Ignacio Corpus and sentenced \nAnastasio Avillar, Maximiano Niegos, and Pedro Niegos to five years imprisonment \nand to pay, each of them, one-fifth of the costs. The judgment is couched in the \nfollowing language:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The court is of the opinion, therefore, that the accused Anastasio Avillar, \nPedro Niegos, and Maximiano Niegos are guilty beyond any reasonable doubt and \nsentences them and each of them to five years in Bilibid and to pay one-fifth of \nthe costs of this proceeding.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This judgment was rendered in Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija. The clerk of the court in \ninstructing the municipal president of that municipality to send the convicted \nmen to Cabanatuan, said that they were sentenced \"to the penalty of five years \nin each cause\" (p. 53 of the record). On appeal the convicted men stated that in \nthe judgment \"the undersigned are sentenced to five years' imprisonment in each \ncause\" (p. 166 of the record) and Anastasio Avillar, in withdrawing his appeal, \nsays that \"he was sentenced to the penalty of five years in each one of the \naforementioned causes\" (p. 185 of the record). The judgment, however, was one \nand the same for all three causes; it was pronounced in a single trial and its \nlanguage does not warrant tjie construction that it imposes five years' \nimprisonment in each cause, or a total of fifteen years.<\/p>\n<p>This manner of pronouncing judgment is most defective; it does not express \nthe exact penalty that the law prescribes. The Solicitor-General remarks in his \nbrief in this court that the Supreme Court has frequently enjoined the \nobservance of the mandates of the law in this respect.<\/p>\n<p>In cause No. 2370, as the value of the stolen carabao is P160, the crime \ncommitted should have been punished in accordance with article 518, No. 3, of \nthe Penal Code; but by Act No. 2030, the punishment imposed should be in \naccordance with article 520, raising the penalty imposed by the former article \nto the next higher one, which, in the medium degree, as there was no modifying \ncircumstance, is that of four years four months and one day of <em>presidio \ncorreccional<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>In cause No. 2373, although the value of the stolen carabaos is P515, and not \nP550 as stated in the complaint, nevertheless the crime should have been \npunished under paragraph two of the said article 518; but, a,s this penalty \nshould be raised to the next higher one, that applicable is five years five \nmonths and eleven days of <em>presidio correccional.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In cause No. 2374 the penalty is identical with that imposed in cause No. \n2370, since the value of the stolen carabao is P160.<\/p>\n<p>All three actions have been dismissed with respect to Anastasio Avillar on \naccount of the withdrawal of his appeal, as may be seen on page 11 of the record \nin cause No. 2370.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is set aside with respect to the defendants \nMaximiano Niegos and Pedro Niegos, and, in lieu thereof, we hereby sentence \nthem, in case No. 2370, to four years two months and one day of <em>presidio \ncorreccional<\/em>; in case No. 2373, to five years five months and one day of \nthe same penalty; in case No. 2374, to four years two months and one day; and in \nall three causes, to the accessory penalties of article 58 of the Penal Code, \nwith one-fifth of the costs of both instances against each defendant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Torres, Johnson, Carson,<\/em> and <em>Araullo, JJ.,<\/em> concur.<\/p>\n<hr align=\"center\" no=\"\" shade=\"\" size=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\/>\n<p><\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>CONCURRING<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>MORELAND, J.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I am in entire accord with the decision in these cases. I desire simply to \nemphasize that part of the opinion which refers to the defective condition of \nthe sentences imposed. They do not specify the penalty as required by the Penal \nCode and by the practice of the courts of the Philippine Islands. It is not \ncorrect, under the facts of these cases, to impose a sentence of \"five years in \nBilibid.\" It is neither correct as to time nor as to form or substance, as is \nclearly shown by the preceding opinion. But even assuming hat the time is right, \nfive years, the sentence is still defective for the reason that it ought to be \nfive years of <em>presidio correccional.<\/em> The defect in the sentence to \nwhich I desire to call attention in particular is the omission of <em>presidio \ncorrectional.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The Penal Code does not permit a sentence in the form here presented and \nCourts of First Instance in imposing sentence should see to it that the Penal \nCode is strictly followed and that every sentence imposed thereunder shall be \ngiven its appropriate name and shall disclose whether it is in the minimum, \nmedium, or maximum degree thereof. This same matter was called to the attention \nof Courts of First Instance in the case of U.

The weapon was a sort of dagger or sharp-pointed \nknife with a blade about 8 inches long. It was carried in a leather sheath, \nattached to a belt which was strapped round the body, and hung down on the left \nhip of the accused concealed from public view inside his trousers.\n<p>The only contention of counsel which would appear to necessitate comment is \nthe claim that the statute penalizing the carrying of concealed weapons and \nprohibiting the keeping and the use of firearms without a license, is in \nviolation of the provisions of section 5 of the Philippine Bill of Bights.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel does not expressly rely upon the prohibition in the United States \nConstitution against the infringement of the right of the people of the United \nStates to keep and bear arms''(U.S. Constitution, amendment 2), which is not \nincluded in the Philippine Bill. But it may be well, in passing, to point out \nthat in no event could this constitutional guaranty have any bearing on the case \nat bar, not only Because it has not been expressly extended to the Philippine \nIslands, but also because it has been uniformly held that both this and similar \nprovisions in State constitutions apply only to arms used in civilized warfare \n(see cases cited in 40 Cyc, 853, note 18); and further, because even in those \njurisdictions wherein the constitutional guaranty of the right to keep and bear \narms is in force, while it is beyond the power of a legislature or municipal \nbody to prohibit entirely the keeping and use of military arms, it may, in the \nexercise of its police powers, for the purpose of suppressing crime and \nlawlessness, lawfully regulate the use of such weapons by providing that they \nqhall not be carried in a concealed manner, or that they shall not be pointed at \nanother, or fired within the limits of a city. (See many cases cited in 40 Cyc, \np. 853.)<\/p>\n<p>Counsel's contention seems to be based on those provisions of the Philippine \nBill of Rights which prohibit the enactment of a law depriving any person of \nlife, liberty, or property without due process of law, or denying to any person \nthe equal protection of the laws. He insists that restrictions placed on the \ncarrying of deadly weapons have the effect of depriving the owner of the free \nuse and enjoyment of his property, and that the granting of licenses to some \npersons to carry firearms and the denial of that right to others is a denial to \nthe latter of the equal protection of the laws.<\/p>\n<p>Both the statute in question and the provision of the Philippine Bill of \nRights with which it is claimed it is in conflict were enacted under American \nsovereignty, and both are to be construed more especially in the light of \nAmerican authority and precedent. The earliest English statute (St. 2 Edw. Ill, \nc. 3) regulating the bearing of arms, enacted in the year 1328 A. D., was but an \naffirmation of the common law offense of going around with unusual and dangerous \nweapons to the terror of the people. Many statutes have been enacted since that \ntime in England and the United States, regulating the carrying and the use of \nweapons, and these have, as a rule, been held to be constitutional, especially \nwhen the prohibitions have been directed to the wearing or carrying of deadly \nweapons in a concealed manner. (See 48 Cent. Digest, tit. Weapons, and many \ncases there cited.)<\/p>\n<p>There can be no real question as to the police power of the state to regulate \nthe use of deadly weapons for the purpose of suppressing or restraining crime \nand lawlessness. Undoubtedly there are many deadly weapons, such as knives, \nbolos, krises and the like which every citizen has a right to own and to use in \nthe various activities of human life. But the right to own and to use such \nweapons does not carry with it the right to use them to the injury of his \nneighbor or so as to endanger the peace and welfare of the community. \"It is a \nsettled principle, growing out of the nature of well-ordered civil society, that \nevery holder of property, however absolute and unqualified may be his title, \nholds it under his implied liability that his use of it may be so regulated that \nit shall not be injurious to the equal enjoyment of others having an equal right \nto the enjoyment of their property, nor injurious to the rights of the \ncommunity.\" Com. <em>vs.<\/em> Alger, 7 Cush. (Mass.), 53, 84.) Provided the \nmeans adopted are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the end in \nview, not unduly oppressive upon individuals, and in the interest of the public \ngenerally rather than of a particular class, the legislature may adopt such \nregulations as it deems proper restricting, limiting, and regulating the use of \nprivate property in the exercise of its police power. (U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> \nToribio, 15 Phil. Rep., 85.)<\/p>\n<p>We think there can be no question as to the reasonableness of a statutory \nregulation prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons as a police measure \nwell calculated to restrict the too frequent resort to such weapons in moments \nof anger and excitement. We do not doubt that the strict enforcement of such a \nregulation would tend to increase the security of life and limb, and to suppress \ncrime and lawlessness, in any community wherein the practice of carrying \nconcealed weapons prevails, and this without being unduly oppressive upon the \nindividual owners of these weapons. It follows that its enactment by the \nlegislature is a proper and legitimate exercise of the police power of the \nstate.<\/p>\n<p>The right to regulate the use of firearms, and to prescribe the conditions \nunder which they may be kept and used by their owners rests upon substantially \nsimilar grounds. The general provisions touching the licensing of the use of \nsuch arms are mere police regulations, intended to limit such use so that \nfirearms will not fall into the hands of persons whose use of them might \nendanger the peace of the state or the safety and security of individuals. While \nit may be true that those charged with the .issuing of such licenses willfully \nor mistakenly decline to issue or approve licenses in some cases in which the \napplicants are equally entitled with others to receive them, nevertheless the \nregulations themselves are of general application and in no wise deny the equal \nprotection of the law to all applicants. The fault in such cases is not with the \nlaw, but with those charged with its administration.<\/p>\n<p>We find no errors in the proceedings prejudicial to the rights of the \naccused. The judgment entered in the court below should therefore be affirmed, \nwith the costs of this instance against the appellant. So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Judgment in a suit on a mortgage in favor of the \nmortgagee, Ezequiel Ruiz, was declared a preferred credit. Judgment in an action \nfor debt was rendered in favor of Cecilio Imaz. In this suit Ezequiel Ruiz was \nan intervener. The first was appealed to the Supreme Court and is still pending. \nThe judgment in the second case became final and execution issued thereon on \nApril 19, 1913, Under this execution the realty in question was sold at a \nsheriff's sale, subject to the payment of the mortgage credit of Ruiz and was \npurchased by Imaz, the judgment creditor. On July 8,1913, on petition of Imaz, \nthe court made the order for the appointment of a receiver and issued the \npreliminary injunction complained of in this certiorari action. Both the order \nappointing the receiver and the one directing the preliminary injunction to \nissue were made upon the petition of Imaz <em>ex parte,<\/em> without giving the \nherein plaintiff an opportunity to be heard. Upon being informed of the issuance \nof these orders the herein plaintiff commenced this action in the Supreme Court \nwithout first having sought the annulment or a modification of these orders in \nthe court out of which they were issued, notwithstanding the fact that the \nrespondent judge has been in the district from the date of the issuance of said \norders up to the present time.<\/p>\n<p>In view of the fact that the orders complained of in this action were issued \n<em>ex parte,<\/em> the question arises whether it is not the better practice to \nrequire the party seeking to have such orders annulled or modified to present \nthe matter to the court out of which the orders were issued before seeking his \nremedy in this court.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Herrera <em>vs.<\/em> Barretto and Joaquin (25 Phil. Rep., 245, \n272), which was an original action of certiorari, this court said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We cannot leave the case without suggesting that the applicant herein, \nbefore coming to this court, should, as the better practice, have made the \nproper application to the Court of First Instance for a dissolution or \nmodification of the mandatory injunction, and thereby given that court an \nopportunity after full argument of counsel and citation of authorities, to pass \nupon the question of his power and jurisdiction, and even, the correctness and \npropriety of his action, should power and jurisdiction be found by the court to \nexist. Questions which Courts of First Instance are required by law to decide \nshould not be summarily taken from them and presented to this court without \nfirst giving them an opportunity of deliberately passing on such questions \nthemselves. The most natural and proper thing to do when such court, in the \njudgment of one of the parties, has issued an injunction erroneously, is \nimmediately to call the attention of that court to its supposed error and ask \nfor its correction. The strongest reasons of policy and courtesy, if not actual \nlegal right itself, require such procedure; and we discourage all attempts to \ncome to this court upon questions which a court below is entitled to decide \nwithout first invoking its judgment thereon. There are special reasons for \nfollowing this course in cases where the court has acted <em>ex \nparte.<\/em>\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The orders complained of having been issued ex parte, the petitioner Gonzalez \nshould have called the attention of the respondent judge to the supposed errors \nbefore coming to this court.

THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, RESPONDENT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>JOHNSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">It appears from the record that Tan Seng, a Chinese boy of about 17 years of \nage, claiming to be the son of Tan Chin Hin, a resident merchant of the city of \nManila, arrived at the port of Manila from China on the steamship Chinhita, on \nthe 13th day of February, 1914. The customs authorities refused Tan Seng the \nright to enter the Philippine Islands. The question was referred to the board of \nspecial inquiry and an investigation was held, in which several witnesses \ntestified. After hearing the. evidence, two of the three members of the board of \nspecial inquiry found that the said Tan Seng was not, in their opinion, the \nlegitimate son of the said Tan Chin Hin, and denied to Tan Seng the right to \nenter the Philippine Islands.The third member of the board, while he admitted \nthat there were some discrepancies in the proof adduced before the board, held \nthat the same were not of sufficient importance to refuse the said Tan Seng the \nright to land in the Philippine Islands.\n<p>From the decision of the board of special inquiry an appeal was taken to the \nCollector of Customs, the Honorable B. Herstein, who, upon an examination of the \nrecord sent to him, found that the said Tan Seng was not entitled to enter the \nPhilippine Islands, and held as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is claimed on behalf of this immigrant (Tan Seng) that he is the \nlegitimate minor son of Tan Chin Hin, a resident Chinese merchant. He states \nthat he is 17 years of age and that he has two younger brothers, aged 13 and 9, \nrespectively. The witnesses presented on his behalf testified that they are \nacquainted with the father of this immigrant and his family and that the \nimmigrant is such legitimate son, as claimed, but there appear to be \n<em>discrepancies in their evidence <\/em>as to the ages of the other children in \nthe family. The board of (special) inquiry found that the applicant has <em>the \nappearance of being considerably younger than seventeen<\/em> and considering \nfurther the nature of the testimony of the witnesses as to the age of the other \nmembers of the (Tan Chin Hin's) family, concluded that the applicant is not the \nson of Tan Chin Hin, as claimed.<\/p>\n<p>\"From a careful review of the record in the case, the conclusions of the \nboard of special inquiry appear to be reasonable and just and no reason is seen \nfor reversing the decision made. <\/p>\n<p>\"The said Tan Seng is therefore refused landing, and it is hereby ordered \nthat he be returned to his port of embarkation at the expense of the vessel \nbringing him, on the next sailing of any vessel of the same \nline.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Upon being informed of the foregoing decision of the Collector of Customs, \nthe said Tan Chin Hin, on behalf of his alleged son, Tan Seng, presented a \npetition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Court of First Instance in the city \nof Manila. Upon a consideration of said petition, the judge of the Court of \nFirst Instance issued an order requiring the Collector of Customs to show cause \nwhy the writ of habeas corpus should not be granted as prayed for. In response \nto said order the Collector of Customs made a full and complete statement of the \nproceedings had before him in the department of customs, accompanying said \nreport by a certified copy of all the proceedings, including the evidence taken \nbefore the board of special inquiry.<\/p>\n<p>Upon the issue presented by said petition and return, the judge of the Court \nof First Instance, apparently without first determining that there had been an \n<em>abuse of authority<\/em> on the part of the customs department, proceeded to \ntake testimony upon the question whether or not the said Tan Seng was entitled \nto enter the Philippine Islands. The right to determine, in the first instance, \nwhether or not a Chinese alien has a right to enter the United States or the \nterritories thereof to which the Chinese Immigration Laws have been extended, \nhas been conferred by law upon a branch of the executive department of the \nGovernment, The judicial department of the Government has no authority or right \nto intervene in determining the right of aliens to enter the Philippine Islands, \nexcept and until it has been, proven and shown clearly that that branch of the \nexecutive department of the Government upon which the power to determine that \nquestion has been conferred by law, <em>has abused its authority. <\/em>In other \nwords, until it is shown that the customs authorities have abused their \nauthority in refusing Chinese aliens the right to land in the Philippine \nIslands, the courts are without authority to intervene. The decision of the \ncustoms authorities is final, unless it is shown that they have abused their \nauthority. An abuse of authority exists when there is no proof presented to \nsupport the conclusions of the customs authorities or when they have misapplied \na clear provision of the law. The customs authorities act more or less as a jury \nin determining the facts in the first instance. They have an opportunity to see \nand hear the witnesses and they are under no obligation to believe the \ndeclarations of a witness if his manner or conduct during the examination is \nsuch as to cause them to disbelieve him, even though his declarations are not \ndisputed by any other witness.

The supervision is confined to the department of \nimmigration charged with the enforcement of laws regulating the admission. The \nfinal determination of all facts with relation to the qualification of aliens to \nenter the United States or their deportation is intrusted to the proper \nimmigration officers, \"whose decision is final, unless reversed on appeal to the \nSecretary of Labor\" (in the Philippine Islands the Collector of Customs). By the \nAct of Congress these officers are made the sole and exclusive judges of the \nexistence of the facts establishing qualification, and <em>no other \ntribunal<\/em> is vested with authority or power by Congress to reexamine and \nconsider the sufficiency of the evidence on which these officers acted, until it \nis shown that such officers abused the authority conferred upon them by law. So \nlong as the officers clothed with this authority act within the limits placed by \nCongress, <em>courts have no right to interfere.<\/em> The authority of the \nimmigration officers and the jurisdiction of the courts depend upon the power \nconferred by Congress. It is a matter of legislation. No discretion is vested in \nthe courts. Congress has the right to legislate upon the subject, <em>prescribe \nrules, fix limits, and confer authority where it deems wise in legislating upon \nthe subject at hand.<\/em> Under the present law, the final authority, unless an \nabuse of authority is shown, is conferred upon the immigration officers. The \nonly right of the courts to intervene is when and after it has been shown that \nsuch officers have abused their authority and that the parties have not been \ngiven a full, fair, and free hearing. (Ekiu <em>vs.<\/em> U. S., 142 U. S., 651; \nLo Po <em>vs.<\/em> McCoy, 8 Phil. Rep., 343; Ex Parte Petkos, 212 Fed., Rep., \n275; U. S. <em>vs.<\/em> Ju Toy, 198 U. S., 253; Ex Parte Joyce, 212 Fed., Rep., \n282.)<\/p>\n<p>A <em>mere refusal<\/em> by the proper authorities to allow an alien to enter \nthe territory of the United States is not an abuse of authority. The law permits \nthe examining officer or board to examine the applicant for admission, and such \nother witnesses as may be presented, to hear their testimony and to decide upon \nsuch testimony whether or not the applicant is entitled to enter. The authority \nto examine into the facts relating to the right of the applicant to enter \nimplies the discretion to decide upon such evidence, and unless it is clearly \nproved that this discretion was abused, the courts will refuse to take \njurisdiction for the purpose of determining the questions of the right of the \nalien to enter. (Lo Po <em>vs.<\/em> McCoy, 8 Phil. Rep., 343.)<\/p>\n<p>The attorney for the appellee in the present case asserts that there was no \nproof adduced against the right of the said Tan Seng to land in the Philippine \nIslands. The burden is not upon the executive department of the Government to \nshow that an alien immigrant has not a right to land in the territory of the \nUnited States. The burden is upon the alien seeking to land to show that he has \na right to enter. Upon this branch of the case, therefore, it is our conclusion, \nthere being some proof to support the conclusions of the customs authorities, \nthat there was no abuse of authority and that the judge of the Court of First \nInstance was without authority in the present case to admit proof upon the right \nof Tan Seng to land in the Philippine Islands. The Court of First Instance had \nno jurisdiction even to consider the case in the first instance, further than to \ndetermine whether or not there had been an abuse of authority on the part of the \ncustoms authorities.<\/p>\n<p>The attorney for the petitioner in his brief attempts to show that the \nCustoms authorities of the Philippine Islands are without right to examine into \nthe question of the right of Chinese aliens to land in the Philippine Islands. \nThat question has been presented to this court in numerous instances and in each \ninstance has been decided against his contention. (<em>In re<\/em> Allen, 2 Phil. \nRep., 630; Ngo-Ti <em>vs.<\/em> Shuster, 7 Phil. Rep., 355; Jao Igco <em>vs.<\/em> \nShuster, 10 Phil. Rep., 448; Juan Co <em>vs.<\/em> Rafferty, 14 Phil.

It is, therefore, hereby ordered and decreed that \nthe judgment of this court be entered reversing the judgment of the Court of \nFirst Instance and affirming the judgment of the Collector of Customs, and that \nthe case be remanded to the Court of First Instance from whence it came and that \na judgment be entered therein in accordance with the foregoing.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

In that case it was stated:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"An abuse of authority certainly exists:<\/p>\n<p>\" (<em>a<\/em>) When a person has been denied admission into the territory of \nthe United States who does not belong to any of the excluded classes. For \nexample: A citizen of the United States or any other person who has acquired a \nright to be in and to remain in territory of the United States. (U. S. \n<em>vs.<\/em> Go-Siaco, 12 Phil.

In the case \nof Fong Yue Ting <em>vs.<\/em> The United States (149 U. S., 698), the court \nsaid:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If no evidence is offered by the Chinaman, the judge makes the order of \ndeportation, as upon a default. If he produces competent evidence to explain the \nfact of his not having a certificate, it must be considered by the judge; and if \nhe thereupon appears to be entitled to a certificate, it is to be granted to \nhim.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This rule (<em>c<\/em>) is now modified by the present decision and the \ncorrect rule on the subject stated to be: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The burden is not upon the executive department of the Government to show \nthat an alien immigrant has not a right to land in the territory of the United \nStates. The burden is upon the alien seeking to land to show that he has a right \nto enter.\"<br\/><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Second, as to (<em>b<\/em>):<\/p>\n<p>I am constrained to believe that the case cited does not correctly state the \nrule relative to the kind of hearing that must be given' to the alien, and that \nthat error is carried into the present decision. It says: \"The only right of the \ncourts to intervene is when and after it has been shown that such officers have \nabused their authority and that the parties have not been given a full, fair, \nand free hearing.\"<\/p>\n<p>As I understand the rule, it does not require a full or a \"free\" hearing. All \nthat is required is a <em>hearing.<\/em> It does not have to have the elements of \na formal trial and no formal complaint or pleadings are required and the want of \nthem does not affect the authority of the judge, or the validity of the statute. \n(Fong Yue Ting <em>vs.<\/em> The United States, 149 U. S.,698, 729.)<\/p>\n<p>In the Japanese Immigrant Case (189 U. S., 86) the kind of hearing which was \naccorded the immigrant is stated by the court as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Besides, the record now before us shows that the appellant had notice, \nalthough not a formal one, of the investigation instituted for the purpose of \nascertaining whether she was illegally in this country. The traverse to the \nreturn made by the Immigration Inspector shows upon its face that she was before \nthat officer pending the investigation of her right to be in the United States, \nand made answers to questions propounded to her. It is true that she pleads a \nwant of knowledge of our language; that she did not understand the nature and \nimport of the questions propounded to her; that the investigation made was a \n\"pretended\" one; and that she did not, at the time, know that the investigation \nhad reference to her being deported from the country. These considerations \ncannot justify the intervention of the courts. * * * Suffice it to say, it does \nnot appear that appellant was denied an opportunity to be heard. And as no \nappeal was taken to the Secretary from the decision of the immigration \ninspector, that decision was final and conclusive. If the appellant's want of \nknowledge of the English language put her at some disadvantage in the \ninvestigation conducted by that officer, that was her misfortune, and \nconstitutes no reason, under the acts of Congress, or under any rule of law, for \nthe intervention of the court by habeas corpus. We perceive no ground for such \nintervention\u2014 none for the contention that due process of law was denied to \nappellant.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Can such a hearing as this be held to be a \"full, fair, and free hearing?\" \nNevertheless the court said it was sufficient, saying that while no person shall \nbe deprived of liberty without an opportunity to be heard in respect of matters \nupon which that liberty depends, that does not necessarily mean \"an opportunity \nupon a regular, set occasion, and according to the, forms of judicial procedure, \nbut one that will secure the prompt, vigorous action contemplated by Congress, \nand at the same time be appropriate to the nature of the case upon which such \nofficers are required to act.\" (<em>Id.<\/em>)<\/p>\n<p>For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the rule as to a hearing stated \nin the decision of the court in this case is not the correct one.<br\/><\/p><\/div>",

JUAN AGUAS AND LORENZO SASON, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga \nconvicting the accused of the crime of estafa and sentencing them each to four \nmonths and one day of arresto mayor, the accessories provided by law, to \nindemnify the complaining witness in the sum of P458.70, with subsidiary \nimprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs of the trial.\n<p>It is our opinion that the judgment must be reversed and the accused \nacquitted.<br\/><br\/>It appears from the evidence that Juan Aguas and Lorenzo Sason \nwent to see Mariano Sunglao, the complaining witness in this case, and asked him \nto let them have fish to sell. Arrangements were made by which the two \nappellants were permitted to take fish from Sunglao's fishery at the rate of P16 \na basket. The contention of the prosecution is that the fish were delivered to \nappellants for sale on commission, they being obliged, therefore, to return \nmoney or the fish. Each Tuesday was set for the day upon which the fish taken up \nto that time were to be paid for or delivered. The appellants, on the other \nhand, contend that they bought the fish on credit, that they became the owners \nthereof, and that there was no contract for sale on commission or for redelivery \nof the fish.<\/p>\n<p>It appears that the accused took fish on several occasions and made certain \npayments on their indebtedness, reducing it finally to P458.70. The complaining \nwitness, on the theory that the action of the appellants in refusing to deliver \nthe money constituted the crime of estafa, laid a complaint before the \nprosecuting attorney of the province.<\/p>\n<p>While the evidence of the appellants with respect to the contract is somewhat \nambiguous and part of it may be interpreted in conformity with the contention of \ncomplaining witness, we are, nevertheless, convinced, upon the whole case, that \ntheir contention is proved by the record as a whole. After the parties had \nbecome indebted to the complaining witness in the amount already stated, an \nagreement was drawn up between them recognizing the indebtedness and providing \nfor the time of payment. This agreement, after reciting, the proper facts, \nstates, in reference to the amount specified therein, that it is \"the value of \nthe fish which we have received from said Don Mariano Sunglao for the purpose of \nsale;\" and stipulates further as follows: \"and we agree, jointly and severally, \nto pay to Don Mariano Sunglao the said sum of four hundred and fifty-eight pesos \nand seventy centavos in the month of March of the year 1913; that at this time \nwe have no property with which to pay said sum but, as soon as we obtain the \nmoney or property of any kind, the said Don Mariano Sunglao can oblige us or \neither of us to pay the said sum and he may petition the court for the payment \nof the same and may levy upon and take our property, etc., * * *.\"<\/p>\n<p>As is seen, this agreement contains nothing which would indicate that the \ncontract with the complaining witness with reference to the fish was different \nfrom what the appellants claim it was; and it lacks every element which the \ncomplaining witness would naturally have put into it if he had had the idea at \nthe time of its execution that the appellants were guilty of a crime or that he \ncould hold them criminally for their acts.<\/p>\n<p>There is another piece of evidence in the record, however, which is decisive \nof the relations of the parties with reference to the fish in question. The \nprosecution offered in evidence during the trial at least a portion of the \npreliminary investigation had before the justice of the peace. The record here \non appeal contains all of that investigation; and while it does not appear \ndefinitely from the record that the prosecution offered more than various parts \nof it, the record being here and the Government having made no objection to its \npresence and none to the consideration thereof by the appellants in their brief \nand argument before this court, we must presume that it was all offered and \nreceived and that it can be considered as evidence on the determination of this \nappeal. A portion of the preliminary investigation is composed of the testimony \nof the complaining witness given before the justice of the peace. In that he \nstates in so many words that he sold the fish to the appellants or credit. He \nsaid:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In the month of May, 1911, they (meaning the appellants) came to my house \nand asked me to sell them fish on credit. * * * On the representations of \nLorenzo Sason that Juan Aguas was a good man and solvent, I agreed to let them \nhave my fish on credit at the rate of P\"16 a basket.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There being no claim in this case that the complaining witness was induced to \npart with his fish by reason of false representations, we must hold that the \nevidence establishes that the fish in question were sold to the appellants on \ncredit and that they were not responsible to the complaining witness except \ncivilly.<\/p>\n<p>Nothing herein contained shall be interpreted as depriving the complaining \nwitness of his right of civil action, if any he have, against the appellants; \nand his right to collect the sum due him, if anything, in a civil action is \nhereby reserved to him.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed and the accused acquitted; costs \n<em>de officio.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

MOJICA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the city \nof Manila declaring that the cigar bands or rings attached to the complaint and \nthose in evidence used by the defendant upon his cigars bear such a close \nresemblance to those used on the cigars of the plaintiff that, taken together \nwith other circumstances, their use constituted unfair competition, and forever \nprohibiting the defendant from using said bands or rings.\n<p>It appears from the evidence that the plaintiff has been manufacturing cigars \nof a certain kind and form for a long period of years and during that time has \nused upon said cigars a paper ring or band of a chocolate-brown color, with \nletters and lines upon it in gold. This ring or band, having been used by the \nplaintiff for many years, had become well-known to the trade and was of great \nvalue in the sale of its cigars.<\/p>\n<p>Within the last year or two the defendant commenced to use a band or ring \nvery similar to that of the plaintiff, and it is upon this use that the present \naction is founded.<\/p>\n<p>The band or ring of the plaintiff is of a dark brown color, about \nseven-sixteenths of an inch wide, and divided into three parts or divisions by \ngold lines. In the first division is the word \"Manila\" in capital letters of \ngold. In the second or middle division are two words, \"Excelentes\" and \n\"Alhambra,\" the former being above the latter, and the word \"Alhambra\" being \nenclosed in quotation marks. In the third or last division or part are the \ncapital letters \"A. C. Cy.,\" of the same size as are used in the word \n\"Manila.\"<\/p>\n<p>The bands or rings of the defendant, so far as they appear in the evidence, \nare of two different colors but of the same shape and with substantially the \nsame markings. They are about one-half of an inch xvide and, like those of, the \nplaintiff, are divided into three parts. In the first part is the word \"Manila\" \nin capital letters of the same form and of substantially the same size as used \nby plaintiff in the same word. In the second or middle division are the words \n\"Excelentes\" and \"La Progresiva,\" the former being above the latter and the \nlatter two words being enclosed in quotation marks. Here, again, the words \n\"Excelentes\" and \"La Progresiva\" are in capital letters of the same form and of \nsubstantially the same size as used by the plaintiff in the words \"Excelentes\" \nand \"Alhambra.\" In the third or last division are the words \"I. Luzon.\" In \nanother band used by the defendant we have the same style with the exception of \ncolor, with the same kind of lines and divisions and the same markings, with the \nexception that the word \"Excelentes\" is substituted by the words \"Best Quality.\" \nThe color of defendant's bands, as shown by the exhibits, is either a brown \nexactly the shade of plaintiff's or green with gold lines and gold letter \nmarkings as already stated. The cigars sold by the defendant with the bands \ndescribed, whether of brown or of green, are formed almost exactly like the \ncigars sold by the plaintiff, and with substantially the same color and style of \nwrapper.<\/p>\n<p>In determining whether or not the defendant is guilty of unfair competition \nin using the bands, we have the right and it is our duty to take into \nconsideration all of the other features of the articles offered for sale to \nascertain whether, when taken together with the imitated band, there is \nlikelihood that the public may be deceived as to the article it is purchasing. \nIt is clear that, the cigars having substantially the same appearance and color, \nthe same size, the same shape, and the same style and color of band, the \ndeception is not only possible but is very probable. The cigar put out by the \ndefendant, taken as a whole, disarms and deceives the purchaser who is desirous \nof purchasing cigars of plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>Section 7 of Act No. 666 reads :<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Any person who in selling his goods shall give them the general appearance \nof goods of another manufacturer or dealer, either in the wrapping of the \npackages in which they are contained, or the devices of words thereon, or in any \nother feature of their appearance, which would be likely to influence purchasers \nto believe that the goods offered are of a manufacturer or dealer other than the \nactual manufacturer or dealer, and who clothes the goods with such appearance \nfor the purpose of deceiving the public and defrauding another of his legitimate \ntrade, or any subsequent vendor of such goods or any agent of any vendor engaged \nin selling such goods with a like purpose, shall be guilty of unfair \ncompetition, and shall be liable to an action for damages, in which the measure \nshall be the same as that provided for a violation of trademark rights, together \nwith discretionary power in the court to impose double damages, if the \ncircumstances call for the same. The injured party may also have a remedy by \ninjunction similar to that provided for in cases of violation of trade marks. \nThis section applies in cases where the deceitful appearance of the goods, \nmisleading as to origin or ownership, is effected not by means of technical \ntrademarks, emblems, signs, or devices, but by the general appearance of the \npackage, containing the goods, or by the devices or words thereon, even though \nsuch packages, devices, or words are not by law capable of appropriation as \ntrademarks; and in order that the action shall lie under this section, actual \nintent to deceive the public and defraud a competitor shall affirmatively appear \non the part of the person sought to be made liable, but such intent may be \ninferred from similarity in the appearance of the goods as packed or offered for \nsale to those of the complaining party.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The court found that: \"An examination of the rings used upon the cigars by \nthe defendant as appears from the evidence in connection with the ring which the \nplaintiff has adopted and has used for a long period of time before used by the \ndefendant shows that there can be no doubt but that those used by the defendant \nare similar to the mark used by plaintiff and that they would tend to deceive \nany purchaser using ordinary care in making a purchase. They are so similar, \npacked as they are in a box, that one would have to examine closely the reading \nupon the rings in order to distinguish the difference.\"<\/p>\n<p>Unfair competition consists in passing off or attempting to pass off upon the \npublic the goods or business of one person as and for the goods or business of \nanother. It consists essentially in the conduct of a trade or business in such a \nmanner that there is either an express or implied representation to that effect. \nIt may be stated broadly that any conduct the end and probable effect of which \nis to deceive the public or pass off the goods or business of one person as and \nfor that of another, constitutes actionable unfair competition. Unfair \ncompetition, as thus defined, is a legal wrong for which the courts afford a \nremedy. It is a tort and a fraud. The basic principle is that no one has a right \nto dress up his goods or otherwise represent them in such a manner as to deceive \nan intending purchaser and induce him to believe he is buying the goods of \nanother. Protection against unfair competition is not intended to create or \nfoster a monopoly and the court should always be careful not to interfere with \nfree and fair competition, but should confine itself, rather, to preventing \nfraud and imposition resulting from some real resemblance in name or dress of \ngoods. Nothing less than conduct tending to pass off one man's goods or business \nas that of another will constitute unfair competion. Actual or probable \ndeception and confusion on the part of customers by reason of defendant's \npractices must always appear.<\/p>\n<p>Relief against unfair competition is properly afforded upon the ground that \none who has built up a good will and reputation for his goods or business is \nentitled to all the benefits therefrom. Such good will is property and, like \nother property, is protected against invasion. Deception of the public injures \nthe proprietor of the business by diverting his customers and depriving him of \nsales which he otherwise would have made. This, rather than the protection of \nthe public against imposition, is the true basis for the private remedy, \nalthough it is often said that the remedy proceeds in part upon the theory of \nprotection; to the public against fraud. No one has a right to avail himself of \nanother's favorable reputation in order to sell his own goods.<\/p>\n<p>A demand for goods created by advertising belongs to the advertiser and he \nwill be protected therein against unfair competition by another who seeks in any \nway to take advantage of such advertisements to sell his own goods.<\/p>\n<p>In order to make it a case of unfair competition it is not necessary to show \nthat any person has been actually deceived by defendant's conduct and lead to \npurchase his goods in the belief that they are the goods of plaintiff, or to \ndeal with defendant thinking that he was dealing with plaintiff. It is \nsufficient to show that such deception will be the natural and probable result \nof defendant's acts. Either actual or probable deception and confusion must be \nshown, for if there is no probability of deception there is no unfair \ncompetition. As in the case of infringement by imitation of another's trademark, \nthe true test of unfair competition is whether the acts of defendant are such as \nare calculated to deceive the ordinary buyer making his purchases under the \nordinary conditions which prevail in the particular trade to which the \ncontroversy relates. This has been said to include incautious, unwary or \nignorant purchasers, but not careless purchasers who make no examination. The \nfact that careful buyers, who scrutinize closely, are not deceived, merely shows \nthat the injury is less in degree. It does not show that there is no injury. The \nfact that careless purchasers are deceived simply by the use of ordinary and \ncommon forms of putting up goods does not show unfair competition. The class of \npurchasers who buy the particular kind of article manufactured, such as servants \nor children, upon the one hand, or persons skilled in the particular trade, upon \nthe other, must be considered by determining the question of probable deception. \nPurchasers may be deceived and misled into purchasing the goods of one person \nunder the belief that they are purchasing the goods of another person whose \ngoods they intended to buy although they do not know who is the actual \nproprietor of the genuine goods. They are so deceived when they have in mind to \npurchase goods coming from a definite, although unknown, source, with which \ngoods they are acquainted, although they neither know nor care who is the actual \nproprietor of such goods. The ultimate purchaser is the one in view and it is \nsufficient if he is liable to be deceived.<\/p>\n<p>No inflexible rule can be laid down as to what will constitute unfair \ncompetition. Each case is, in a measure, a law unto itself. Unfair competition \nis always a question of fact. The question to be determined in every case is \nwhether or not, as a matter of fact, the name or mark used by the defendant has \npreviously come to indicate and designate plaintiff's goods, or, to state it in \nanother way, whether defendant, as a matter of fact, is, by his conduct, passing \noff defendant's goods as plaintiff's goods or his business as plaintiff's \nbusiness. The universal test question is whether the public is likely to be \ndeceived.<\/p>\n<p>It is often said that a fraudulent intent on the part of defendant to pass \noff his goods or business as or for that of plaintiff is necessary to constitute \nunfair competition. We think the better view is, however, that an actual \nfraudulent intent need not be shown where the necessary and probable tendency of \ndefendant's conduct is to deceive the public and pass off his goods or business \nas and for that of another, especially where the only preventive relief against \ncontinuance of the wrong is, sought or granted. Even if the resemblance is \naccidental and not intentional, plaintiff is entitled to protection against its \ninjurious results to his trade.<\/p>\n<p>Under the evidence in this case there is no doubt whatever in our minds that \nthe use of the chocolate-colored bands by the defendant, taken together with the \nother circumstances under which the article in question is sold, constitutes \nunfair competition. We do not believe, however, that the complaint against the \ngreen band is well founded. That is clearly and easily distinguishable from the \nband used by the plaintiff; and the ordinary purchaser of plaintiff's goods \nwould be able, at a glance, to distinguish defendant's cigars, when, surrounded \nby the green band, from those of plaintiff.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed in all particulars except that with \nreference to the green band, and in that regard is reversed; with costs against \nthe appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

Rep., \n583), which provided as follows:\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And let the judgment further provide that ten days after its entry the \nrecord will be returned to the court below for the taking of such further \nevidence as the parties may desire to present touching the value of the shares \nof corporate stock described in the complaint, on the 10th day of May, 1907, the \ndate of the levy of execution thereon by the sheriff of Manila; whereupon, \njudgment will be entered in the court below for that amount, or so much thereof \nas is not in excess of the amount prayed for in the complaint, with legal \ninterest until paid, in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants Khu \nPack, Rufino Dy Tiao Chong, and Yap Tiong Sing.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The trial judge found that the evidence submitted by the plaintiff was \ninsufficient to sustain a finding that these shares of stock had any actual or \nmarket value at the time of the loan, upon which to base a judgment in favor of \nthe plaintiff. He refused to believe the testimony offered as to an alleged sale \nand certain negotiations touching a proposed sale of the stock in support of the \nalleged market value of the stock, and was of opinion that the weight of the \nevidence tended to sustain a finding, that due to the insolvent condition of the \ncompany at the date of the levy and throughout the course of these proceedings, \nthe shares of stock in question were absolutely worthless, and had no actual or \nreal value. We find nothing in the record which would justify us in disturbing \nthe findings of the trial judge in this regard, and we are well satisfied from \nall the evidence of record that plaintiff's interest in the stock at the date of \nthe levy had no value whatsoever.<\/p>\n<p>It is true that at the sheriff's sale, the stock in question was sold for the \nsum of P500 to one of the creditors of the original owner, subject to a pledge \nfor one-half of its nominal value, but we do not think that the bid of a \ncreditor at a sheriff's sale affords any safe criterion as to the true value of \nthe property upon which he makes his bid. A valid bid by a stranger to the \nproceedings would tend to establish that the property in question is worth at \nleast the amount of the bid; but a bid by a creditor with the understanding that \nthe amount bid is to be credited on his debt does not necessarily indicate that \nit is worth that amount, even in the opinion of the bidder. Property sold at \nsheriffs' sales is frequently bid in by the creditor for an amount equal to or \nless than his debt, not because he believes the property worth the amount bid, \nbut because he believes his only chance to recover anything on his debt is to \ntake the property itself whether it is or is not worth the amount of the bid, \nand make the best of it.<\/p>\n<p>Since the burden of establishing the value of these shares of stock clearly \nrested on the plaintiff, the judgment entered in the court below should be \naffirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.

Guiane la tienda de \nquincalleria de su propiedad, establecida en el No. 191 de la Calle Rosario, \nDistrito de Binondo, Manila, por el precio de P6000.00, pagaderos P500 en el \nacto de entregarse la escritura de venta, y P500.00, con los intereses del resto \ndel precio al 8$ anua, cada seis meses hasta su completo pago. Fue condicion de \nla venta, que si los compradores dejasen de pagar fielmente los plazos e \nintereses convenidos, la vendedora tendria derecho a rescindir la venta, \nhaciendo suyas todas las cantidades pagadas por los compradores hasta la fecha \nde la rescision.<br\/><br\/>En virtud de este oonvenio, los oompradores pagaron la \nsuma de P500.00 al otorgarse la escritura, y otros P500.00 al vencimiento del \nprimer plazo, pero dejaron de pagar los intereses sobre el resto del precio, en \ncontravencion con lo pactado en el referido contrato. Es hecho admitido por las \npartes, que los compradores Go Guan Qui y Go Guan Yong no han hecho otros pagos \na cuenta del precio de la citada tienda. <\/p>\n<p>Con fecha 7 de Enero de 1910, la tienda de quincalleria en cuestion fue \nasegurada en la cantidad de P5000.00 por \"The Lancashire Insurance Co., en \nnombre y a favor de Go Guan Qui. Mediante el pago de la prima correspondiente, \nla poliza de seguros fue renovada el 7 de Enero de 1911. En 2 de Noviembre del \nmismo a\u00f1o, la referida tienda fue destruida totalmente por un incendio.<\/p>\n<p>Con fecha 22 de Junio de 1911, Go Guan Qui fallecio en China, sin haber \notorgado testamento y sin dejar otros bienes que el derecho de reclamar los \nP5000.00 de la casa aseguradora.<br\/><br\/>En 7 de Noviembre de 1911, Eugenia B. \nGuiane presento demanda contra Go Guan Qui y Go Guan Yong, la cual dio origen a \nla causa civil No. 9087, para reclamar los P5000.00 reatantes del precio de la \nventa de la referida tienda con sus intereses al 8% anual. La demandante en \naquel asunto tambien obtuvo el embargo preventivo de la poliza de seguros que \nrespondia, a favor de Go Guan Qui, de las perdidas sufridas por la tienda hasta \nla suma de P5000.00.<\/p>\n<p>Dos dias despues de presentada la demanda en el asunto No. 9087, o sea el 9 \nde Noviembre de 1911, Go Guan Yong, uno de los demandados en dicho asunto, \npromovio el expediente No. 9107 sobre insolvencia voluntaria. De acuerdo con su \npeticion, el Juzgado le declaro insolvente y ordeno que ningun deudor del \nsolicitante le pagara su deuda, haciendo especial mencion de la poliza de \nseguros arriba citada.<\/p>\n<p>En este estado las cosas, y habiendose enterado Eugenia B. Quiane que Go Guan \nQui habla fallecido, promovio estas actuaciones especiales No. 9189, para la \nadministracion de los bienes relictos del finado Go Guan Qui. La solicitud fue \npresentada el 12 de Diciembre de 1911. De acuerdo con la solicitud, el Juzgado \nnombro administrador y comisionados de avaluo.<\/p>\n<p>Con fecha 27 de Febrero de 1912, el administrador de los bienes del finado Go \nGuan Qui, promovio el expediente No. 9389, presentado demanda en contra de \"The \nLancashire Insurance Co.\", pidiendo se ordene el pago a su favor del importe de \nla poliza de seguros No. 14298499, expedido a favor de Go Guan Qui. La compa\u00f1ia \ndemandada presento su escrito de contestacion alegando, que la citada poliza era \nobjeto de un embargo preventivo expedido por el mismo Juzgado en el asunto No. \n9087, y que siempre habia estado dispuesta a pagar el importe de la poliza a la \npersona a cuyo favor se ordenase por el Juzgado. Sin objecion alguna de las \npartes acreedoras de Go Guan Qui, el Juzgado ordano la entrega de los P5000.00, \nimporte de la referida poliza de seguros, e Felipe Canillas en su concepto de \nadministrador de los bienes del intestado de Go Guan Qui. El Juzgado tambien \nordeno la acumulacion de los cuatro expedientes, No. 9189, No. 9087, No. 9107 y \nNo. 9389. (fols. 14 - 16 de la Pieza de Testimonios impresa.)<\/p>\n<p>Abierto que fue el periodo para la presentacion de las reclamaciones contra \nel intestado, Eugenia B. Guiane presento su escrito de reclamacion ante los \ncomisionados de avaluo, alegando que con fecha 16 de Junio de 1909 habia vendido \nuna tienda de quincalleria, establecida en el No. 191 de la Calle Rosario, a la \nsociedad regular colectiva \"Go Guan Qui\", formada por Go Guan Yong y el finado \nGo Qui, por la suma de P6000.00 pagaderos en plazos determinados; que de esta \ncantidad, la sociedad compradora solamente ha satisfecho la suna de P1000.00; \nque en vista de este hecho y despues de haber expirado el plazo para el pago del \nresto del precio convenido, y por exigencias de la reclamante, la referida \ntienda fue asegurada en P5000.00 a favor de la razon social \"Go Guan Qui\"; que \nla referida tienda fue completamente destruida por un incendio y el importe del \nseguro pagado al administrador de este inteatado; que en el contrato de venta de \ndicha tienda, la reclamante se habla reservado el derecho de rescindir el \ncontrato, haciendo suyas todas las cantidades pagadas por los compradores en su \nvirtud, caso de que estos no cumplan fielmente con todo lo pactado; que en vista \nde que la tienda fue destruida, la reclamante tiene derecho a los P5000.00 \npagados por la casa aseguradora. (fols. 7 - 10 de la Pieza de Testimonios \nimpresa.) Esta reolamacion fue admitida por los comicionados, sin que se haya \ninterpuesto apelacion contra dicha decision.<\/p>\n<p>Jose Alindogan presento la suya por P28.30, suma a que ascienden las \ncantidades abonadas por el reclamante para pagar los derechos de escribania, y \nel costo de la publicacion de las notlficaciones necesarias, en este expediente \nque fue promovido por el mismo reclamante, reclamacion admitida por los \ncomisionados.<\/p>\n<p>Clemente Gochuico presento una reclamacion por P175.00, suma a que ascienden \nlos alquileres, correspondientes a los meses de Ootubre y Septiembre de 1911, de \nla accesoria No. 191 de la Calle Rosario en que estaba establecida la tienda del \nfinado Go Guan Qui. Esta reclamacion fue admitida.<\/p>\n<p>Los otros acreedores son: Lutz &amp; Co. por P1087.99; Struckman &amp; \nKuttner por P1765.42; Froelich &amp; Kuttner por P719.91; y Keller &amp; Co. por \nP5,509.62,todos por saldo de cuentas de venta de efectos a la tienda.<\/p>\n<p>Todas estas reclamaciones fueron desestimadas por los comisionados de avaluo; \npero entablada apelacion ante el Juzgado de herencias, este las admitio y dicto \nsentencia a favor de cada una de ellas, llevando todas fecha de 13 de Septiembre \nde 1912.<\/p>\n<p>Como quiera que todas estas demandas importaban por junta P15,070.24, y el \ncaudal existente no era mas que de P5000.00 o sea el valor de la poliza del \nseguro, el administrador del abintestato, en su informe, propuso prelacion de \ncreditos que debian ser satlsfechos, en esta forma: 1.o Jose Alindogan por \nP28.30; 2.o Clemente Gochuico por P175.00; 3.o Eugenia B. Guiane por \nP5000.00.<\/p>\n<p>Pero el Juzgado, en su decision de 25 de Septiembre de 1912, fallo que se \ndistribuyan los fondos existentes con arreglo a los articulos 735 y 736 del \nCodigo de procedimientos civiles,es decir, que los P5000.00 se adjudiquen a \nprorrata entre dichos acreedores.<\/p>\n<p>Eugenia B. Guiane apelo de esta decision.<\/p>\n<p>Estan fuera de toda cuestion los creditos de Jose Alindogan por P28.30 y de \nGochuico por P175,00.<\/p>\n<p>Unicamente se cuestiona, por medio de la presente apelacion, si Eugenia B. \nGuiane, la acreedora por el resto del precio de la tienda No. 191 de la Calle \ndel Rosario que quedaron adeudandola Go Guan Qui y Go Guan Yong, a quienes habia \nsido vendida, tiene alguna preferencia sobre las expresadas cuatro casas \ncomerciales, o por el contrario debe concurrir con estas para el cobro a \nprorrata de su credito.<\/p>\n<p>Antes de resolver la cuestion, es de necesidad aclarar algunos puntos \nconforme al resultado de las pruebas.<\/p>\n<p>No hay prueba alguna de sociedad regular colectiva con razon social \"Go Guan \nQui\", ni la poliza del seguro se ha otorgado a favor de alguna sociedad llamada \nGo Guan Qui. Lo unico que aparece probado en autos es que la venta de la tienda \nNo. 191 de la calle del Rosario se hizo a los dos chinos Go Guan Qui y Go Guan \nYong: asi consta en la escritura notarial de 16 de Junio de 1909, que es el \ndocumento que prueba el dominio de estos dos compradores sobre la expresada \ntienda, documento que esta fuera de toda cuestion. Incuestionable es, \nconsiguientemente, que dos eran los due\u00f1os de la tienda de que se trata Go Guan \nQui y Go Guan Yong. De condominio o comunidad de bienes, y no de sociedad \nalguna, era el vinculo que unia a estos dos en la tienda de que se trata. Y aun \ncuando los dos hubieren pensado establecer, y establecido tambien, entre ellos \nsociedad alguna, no siendo conocidos en estos varios juicios promovidos cuales \nfueran sus pactos, y habiendo contratado cada uno de ellos en su propio nombre, \ncomo lo ha hecho Go Guan Qui al asegurar la tienda en su propio nombre y al \nhacer compras de efectos tambien en su propio nombre de las cuatro casas \ncomerciales ya nombradas, no puede tal sociedad tener personalidad juridica, ni \nmas significaoion que la de una comunidad de \"bienes. (Cod. civ. 1669).<\/p>\n<p>2.o Asi, siendo condue\u00f1os de la tienda tantas veces mencionada, Go Guan Qui \nera due\u00f1o de una mitad y Go Guan Yong de la otra mitad, y otro tanto vino a ser \nrespecto de los P5000, importe del seguro, que vino a suceder en lugar de la \ntienda incendiada, una mitad correspondia a Go Guan, Qui y otra mitad a Go Guan \nYong. <\/p>\n<p>3.o Siendo una mitad de estos P5000 de Go Guan Yong, y no habiendo fallecido \nGo Guan Yong, sino tan solamente Go Guan Qui, al abintestato de este no ha \npodido ir sino una mi tad de los P5000, como tampoco hubiera podido ir de la \ntienda si no se hubiera quemado, sino su interes en ella, o sea una mitad.<\/p>\n<p>4.o Sin embargo, por la acumulacion de todos los autos consentida por las \npartes, segun queda relatado, entre ellos los de insolvencia de Go Guan Yong que \nha provocado el concurso de acreedores, esta justificado que al presente la \nmitad del condominio correspondente a Go Guan Yong tambien se halle afecta a la \nconcurrencia de acreedores y que en una sentencia se resuelva el derecho de los \nacreedores concurrentes sobre la totalidad de aquel dinero.<\/p>\n<p>Y asi, dados estos supuestos y resolviendo la cuestion, este Supremo \nTribunal, reiterando una vez mas la jurisprudencia que forman varias decisiones \ndictadas por el mismo, decide que el credito de Eugenia B. Guiane goza de \npreferencia sobre los de las cuatro casas comerciales mencionadas para su pago \nhasta donde alcance la cantidad de dinero concursada. El credito de la apelante \nconsta en escritura publica, su fecha 16 de Junio de 1909. Los respectivos de \nlas cuatro casas comerciales tienen a su favor sentencias firmes, todas de fecha \n13 de Septiembre de 1912. Los creditos que constan en escritura publica o por \nsentencia firme tendran preferencia entre si por el orden de antiguedad de las \nfechas de las escrituras y de las sentencias; (Cod. civ. 1924, 3.o); la \npreferencia, por tanto, la tiene en su favor el credito de la apelante, por \nconstar en escritura publica de 16 de Junio de 1909, debiendo ser antepuesta en \nel pago a los creditos con sentencia firme de 13 de Septiembre de 1912, y no \nconcurriendo con ellos a prorrata. (7, Jur. Fil. 15).<\/p>\n<p>Que si tal escritura de 16 de Junio de 1909 no es equiparable a la escritura \npublica de que hace merito el Art. 1924 por no revestir la forma ni las \nsolemnidades de las escrituras publicas del antiguo regimen a que alude el \nCodigo civil; pero este Supremo Tribunal ha decidldo ya, que un documento \notorgado ante un notario publico nombrado con arreglo a las disposiciones de la \nactual legislacion es una esoritura publica en el sentido en que se emplea esa \npalabra en el Art. 1924 del Codigo civil (12, Jur. Fil. 100).<\/p>\n<p>Se declara preferente el credito de la apelante sobre los cuatro ya \nexpresados acreedores Lutz &amp; Co., Struckman &amp; Co., Froelich &amp; \nKuttner, Keller &amp; Co.; por lo que se ordena que despues de pagados los de \nJose Alindogan por P28.30 y Clemente Gochuico por P175.00 se aplique el resto al \npago del credito de Eugenia B. Guiane.<\/p>\n<p>Se revoca la sentencia apelada sin especial pronunciamiento de costas de esta \ninstancia.<\/p>\n<p>Veinte dias despues dictese sentencia en los terminos de esta decision, y a \nlos diez de dictada procedase a la de volucion consiguiente.<\/p>\n<p>Asi se ordena.<\/p>\n<p>CONFORMES:<\/p>\n<p><em>Gomez J., Johnson J., Carson J., Moreland J.,<\/em> and <em>Araullo \nJ.<\/em> <br\/><\/p><\/div>",

VICTOR VITUG, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>CARSON, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">The appellant was convicted of unlawfully interfering with two secret-service \nagents of the Bureau of Customs in the discharge of their duties, and sentenced \nto six months' imprisonment under the provisions of section 333 of the Customs \nAdministrative Act (No. 355). The only question raised on this appeal is one of \nfact.\n<p>It is admitted that the two customs agents came from Manila to the \nmunicipality of Lubao, Pampanga, under orders to search the house of Clodualdo \nVitug for opium which it was believed had been illegally imported by him; and \nthat having secured a search warrant from the local justice of the peace they \nproceeded to search the house at about 11 o'clock in the morning, and found \nthere a quantity of opium and certain utensils used by smokers of opium. At this \npoint the evidence for the prosecution and for the defense diverges.<\/p>\n<p>The two secret-service agents testified that as they were about to arrest \nVitug, his family implored them not to do so as they desired to avoid the \nscandal which would result, and asked if there was no other method of satisfying \nthe demands of the law. The secret-service agents replied that it might be \npossible to compromise the case with the Insular Collector of Customs, but that \nit would be necessary for Vitug to accompany them to Manila for this purpose and \ntake with him at least P5,000, which they thought would be sufficient to pay the \nadministrative fine which would be assessed in case a compromise was arranged. \nVitug's family promised to secure the money during the day so that the party \ncould leave for Manila on the 3 o'clock train. Accordingly the two \nsecret-service agents stayed at Vitug's house and kept guard over him in the \nsala. The family was unable to secure the money in time to catch the 3 o'clock \ntrain for Manila, and they induced the customs agents to give them further time \nbefore making the arrest. At about 6:30 that evening Agent Larsen was informed \nthat the provincial governor desired to see him in the municipal building, a \nshort distance away. He left Agent Ramos guarding Vitug and went over to the \nmunicipal building, where the governor inquired into the cause of the detention \nof Vitug. The governor then sent a policeman to Agent Ramos requesting his \npresence also in the municipal building. Ramos refused to leave the prisoner he \nwas guarding without a written order to that effect from Larsen. This report was \ncarried to the governor and, after consultation with Larsen, it was agreed that \nthe governor's party and Larsen should go over to Vitug's house for further \nconsideration of the matter. After Ramos' refusal to leave the prisoner in the \nlatter's house without a written order from Larsen and after the governor's \nmessenger had left the house, the appellant, Victor Vitug, a son of the \nprisoner, approached the satchel in which the customs agents had placed the \nopium and pipes. Ramos immediately ordered him to keep away from this satchel. \nVictor went outside for a few minutes and during his absence the father arose \nfrom the chair onwhich he was sitting and started toward an adjoining room. \nRamos immediately ordered him to sit down again and not to leave the chair. \nShortly afterwards the defendant again entered the room and, approaching the \ntable, turned down the lamp which had been lighted, giving as his excuse that \nthere was too much wind. Ramos became suspicious and took the satchel from the \ntable. The prisoner at the same time started to leave his chair again. Ramos \nasked him where he was going, but just at this moment was seized by the arms and \nan attempt was made by some of those present to take the satchel away from him. \nTurning, he saw that it was the appellant who had hold of him, and looking \naround the room he saw a municipal policeman, Bartolome Rivera. Ramos informed \nthe policeman that he was a customs secret-service agent, and just then he heard \na police whistle after which some more policemen arrived on the scene, among \nwhom was Victorio Calamares, who drew his revolver. Ramos called on them for \nassistance in defending possession of the satchel and then called aloud for \nAgent Larsen. It does not clearly appear from the testimony whether these \npolicemen attempted to aid Ramos or those who surrounded him, but Ramos was \nunder the impression that they were endeavoring to interfere with him in the \nperformance of his duties, and that they were more disposed to go to the \nassistance of the Vitugs than to aid him in guarding the prisoner and the opium \nwhich had been seized and left in his care. By this time the party in the \nmunicipal building had started for Vitug's house and when Larsen heard Ramos \ncall for help he immediately rushed into the house, where quiet arid order were \nsoon restored with the help of the provincial governor, who also arrived within \na few seconds.<\/p>\n<p>The defense maintains by the evidence of Vitug's wife and his niece that the \ncustoms agents made overtures to the family after the discovery of the opium for \nhush money and that they insisted upon P5,000 as the price, of silence, \nthreatening to carry Vitug to Manila handcuffed, where they said he would die \nwithin two days if he was not allowed to smoke opium. The trial judge refused to \nbelieve their testimony in this regard, and we are not prepared to say that he \nerred in so doing. The customs agents appear to have proceeded openly and in \naccordance with law to secure a search warrant, and the search of the house was \nconducted in the presence of the chief of the municipal police. It appears also \nthat they signed a return of the warrant at the request of the municipal \nauthorities, showing the results of the search. Under all the circumstances we \ndo not believe that the customs agents would have proceeded so openly had it \nbeen their purpose to take advantage of their position as secret-service agents, \nto enrich themselves at the expense of the Vitug family.<\/p>\n<p>As to the incident which occurred in Vitug's house as the governor's party \nwas on its way there, the testimony of the defense is also at variance with that \nfor the prosecution. Vitug's wife, his niece, a woman named Eulalia Espinosa, \nand Dr. Felino Simpao, all testified that they were present when the trouble \nbegan. They swore that Ramos drew his revolver and pointed it at the old man in \na threatening manner merely because he arose from the chair on which he was \nsitting; that then the women screamed and called for the police; that two \nmunicipal policemen came in; and that just about this time Agent Larsen also \narrived. These witnesses denied that the appellant, Victor Vitug, was present, \nand the latter swore that after leaving prior to the disturbance he did not \nreturn to his father's house until about 7 o'clock that evening. This evidence \nis not convincing, and as indicated in the Attorney-General's brief, there are a \nnumber of inconsistencies in the testimony of the witnesses for the defense, \nwhich he develops in his brief. It is at least improbable that Agent Ramos would \nhave drawn his revolver merely to compel Vitug to resume his seat, in view of \nthe fact that Vitug was admitted by all concerned to be old and infirm, unless \nthere had been some other disturbing element in the situation which these \nwitnesses did not disclose. Under the circumstances, as told by the defense, \nthere would have been no occasion for such a show of authority. From their \nevidence it would appear that the old man had been sitting quietly and \nhelplessly in the same place for several hours, and had shown not the slightest \ndisposition to become obstreperous. As to the presence of the defendant, Victor \nVitug, we have not only the testimony of the customs agents, but also the wholly \ndisinterested testimony of the provincial governor and of the third member of \nthe provincial board, who said that they saw him at the door of the house just \nas they arrived soon after the disturbance arose. From all the evidence the \ntrial judge was convinced that the defendant was present and that he caught the \ncustoms agent by the arm in an attempt to get possession of the satchel in which \nthe opium had been placed, and on the whole record we are of opinion that this \nfinding should not be disturbed.<\/p>\n<p>It is urged, however, that the acquittal of the two policemen, Rivera and \nCalamares, who were made codefendants of the appellant, js inconsistent with the \nfinding that the defendant is guilty. We agree with the Attorney-General that \nthis contention is not sound. These policemen were charged with aiding and \nabetting the appellant in interfering with the customs agents. The trial judge \nseems to have had some doubt as to the identity of one of these coaccused, who \nwas charged with pointing his pistol at one of the customs officers. As to the \nother, he appears to have been unable to determine whether the acts, which were \nshown to have been committed by him, were done with the object of interfering \nwith or of assisting the customs officer. But the trial judge was of opinion \nthat there could be no reasonable doubt as to the identity of this appellant or \nas to the purpose or intent of his acts in laying hands upon the customs officer \nand attempting to snatch the satchel from his possession. We see no grounds for \ndisturbing his findings in this regard, and even if it were true that he erred \nin giving the accused policemen the benefit of the doubt, that affords no ground \nwhatever for interfering with his findings as to the appellant, whose guilt was \nconclusively established by the evidence of record.<\/p>\n<p>It is true that the information charges not only that this appellant \ncommitted the specific acts therein attributed to him, but that he committed \nthose acts conspiring together with his coaccused. But the commission of the \nspecific acts charged against this appellant constitute the offense charged, and \nthe failure to establish the conspiracy in no wise defeats or prevents \nconviction for the offense thus charged and proven.<\/p>\n<p>We find no error in the proceedings prejudicial to the substantial rights of \nthe accused. The judgment entered in the lower court convicting and sentencing \nhim should therefore be affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the \nappellant. So ordered.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.

VELOSO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br\/><br\/>D E C I S I O N<\/h3>\n<\/center><p><strong>MORELAND, J.:<\/strong><\/p><div align=\"justify\">This is an action upon a bond.\n<p>It appears that Bartolome Ch. Veloso, on or about the month of January, 1909, \nwas convicted of the crime of seduction in the Court of First Instance of Cebu \nand sentenced to four months of arresto mayor and to recognize and maintain the \nchild born of the relations between him and the girl seduced, Pascuala Denzon. \nAfter having served a part of his sentence, Bartolome Ch. Veloso petitioned the \nGovernor-General for a pardon. This was granted upon the condition that he give \na bond to the girl seduced and to the child born of such seduction, Lourdes \nDenzon, in a sum to be fixed and approved by the court, conditioned that the \nsureties would undertake to assure that said Bartolome Ch. Veloso would furnish \nto the child, Lourdes Denzon, support and maintainance until it arrived at its \nmajority. In pursuance of this requirement the defendant Corazon Ch. Veloso, \njointly and severally with Pedro Rodriguez, executed a bond in favor of the \nplaintiffs, of which the following is a copy:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Know all men by these presents, that we, Corazon Ch. Veloso and Pedro \nRodriguez, as sureties for Bartolome Ch. Veloso, are hereby bound jointly and \nseverally to Pascuala Denzon in the sum of seven thousand five hundred pesos \n(P7,500) to be paid by us and our heirs and administrators, to which payment we \nbind ourselves by these presents.<\/p>\n<p>\"The condition of this obligation is the following:<br\/><br\/>\"Whereas Bartolome \nCh. Veloso was pardoned by the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands of the \nsentence imposed on him by the Court of First Instance of the Province of Cebu \nin the above-entitled cause;<\/p>\n<p>\"Whereas one of the conditions imposed by the Governor General being that the \nsaid Bartolome Ch. Veloso should give a bond, approved by the court, for the \nmaintenance and education of the child, Lourdes Denzon, daughter of the said \nPascuala Denzon, during her minority:<\/p>\n<p>\"Therefore, we, Corazon Ch. Veloso and Pedro Rodriguez, as sureties of the \nsaid Bartolome Ch. Veloso, bind ourselves jointly and severally, and promise \nthat the latter will pay the sums which the court may fix for the maintenance of \nthe said Lourdes Denzon during her minority; and we promise, moreover that the \nsum so named as the support and maintenance of the said child shall be delivered \nto the person who has the care and the legal custody of the said child in \naccordance with the terms and conditions which the court will hereafter fix with \nreference to said support and maintenance.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A stipulation of facts was made in the court below which formed the basis of \nthe decision. The only defense made to the action is based upon the following \nparagraphs in the stipulation of facts:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"That since the month of November, 1910, to the present, Bartolome Ch. \nVeloso, the principal in the bond providing for the support and maintenance of \nthe minor Lourdes Denzon, has been without property or funds to such an extent \nthat he has been unable to satisfy his own necessities and is completely unable \nto pay for the support and maintenance of the said minor Lourdes Denzon, he \nhaving been since said month of November, 1910, without property or money and \nwithout employment of any kind from which he could obtain a \nrecompense.<br\/><br\/>\"That said Bartolome Ch. Veloso, from the time that he \nentered into the obligation to maintain the said minor Lourdes Denzon, fulfilled \nhis obligation by paying thirty pesos every month in accordance with the order \nof the court mentioned in the eighth paragraph of the complaint until the 1st of \nNovember, 1910, from which date he has failed to maintain said minor for the \nreasons alleged in the previous paragraph.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This action is to recover the sum of P900, being P30 a month from November, \n1910, to the filing of the complaint in this action.<\/p>\n<p>The defense based upon the two paragraphs quoted is founded in article 152 of \nthe Civil Code which reads, so far as material, as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The obligation to give support shall cease:<\/p>\n<p>\"1. By the death of the recipient.<\/p>\n<p>\"2. If the means of the person obliged to pay it are reduced to such a point \nthat he or she cannot pay it without neglecting his or her own requirements and \nthose of his or her family.\"<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It is the contention of the appellant that the stipulation of facts, so far \nas quoted, brings the case squarely within the provisions of the article \nreferred to. The learned trial court did not agree with the appellant in this \nregard and found that the sureties were bound in accordance with the express \nwording of their undertaking and that the impoverishment of the principal did \nnot relieve them. He accordingly decided in favor of the plaintiffs and gave \njudgment for the sum of P900 and costs.<\/p>\n<p>This appeal is from that judgment.<\/p>\n<p>We are of the opinion that the judgment appealed from is correct. The \nobligation sought to be enforced here is not, strictly speaking, the legal \nobligation of the principal to maintain and educate his offspring as set out in \nthe Civil Code. Nor is the court seeking to enforce against him the general \nprovisions of the Civil Code (articles 142 to 154) relative to the obligation to \nsupport. If it were, the contention of the appellant would have considerable, if \nnot complete, foundation. The bond was given to fulfill a condition named by the \nGovernor-General as a prerequisite to the pardon which he proposed to issue to \nBartolome Ch. Veloso. In making his conditions to the pardon the \nGovernor-General was not limited to the obligation which the law placed upon \nVeloso to support and maintain his off spring. He had the power to make any \ncondition which he deemed advisable and proper for the welfare of the convict \nand his offspring as well as for the protection of the public interests. From \nthe whole instrument and from the facts and circumstances surrounding its \nexecution, we cannot say that the learned trial court was in error in \ndetermining that it was the intention of the Governor-General to assure beyond \nperadventure that Veloso's offspring should be taken care of by him during its \nminority and that, consequently, it was the intention of the sureties to bind \nthemselves in that sense and to that extent. It is true that we held in the case \nof Bandoy vs. Judge of La Laguna (14 Phil. Rep., 620), that \"where the form of \nthe bond, for the purpose of admitting a defendant in a criminal case to liberty \nduring the pendency of the action, is prescribed by law, such form must be \nfollowed in substance,\" and that \"the authorities can not vary its terms so as \nto impose greater obligations upon the defendant and his bondsmen;\" and that we \nhave also held in the case of Herrera <em>vs.<\/em> Neis (18 Phil. Rep., 366), \nthat \"where a bond is given for the dissolution of an attachment, in the form \nprescribed by section 440 of the Code of Civil Procedure, but contains an \nadditional clause, not prescribed by statute, under which the sureties agree to \nassume a further obligation, no recovery can be had under such additional clause \nwhich is not required by law and for which there is no consideration.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the latter case we laid down the proposition that in general it will not \nbe presumed that a bond given in accordance with the requirements of law was \nintended to have greater reach or broader effect than the conditions which the \nlaw itself imposed. This rule was laid down in aid of the interpretation of a \nbond given in pursuance of law. It was not intended to hold in that case, or \neither of the cases referred to, that parties may not make provisions in bonds \nin civil actions in addition to those required by law, provided the intention is \nclear and the consideration present.<\/p>\n<p>The Civil Code does not require a bond to be given for the maintenance of \nrelations. It simply states the liability of parties to support and maintain \ntheir relations and prescribes how that obligation shall be enforced. The bond \nin the present case was not given in pursuance of law or of any provisions of \nthe Civil Code. We do not have, therefore, the question of whether or not its \nprovisions are broader than the requirements of the law. It was given in \npursuance of a requirement of the Governor-General, precedent to a pardon which \nhad been solicited, and its binding force must be determined by the intention of \nthe parties as gathered from the instrument itself. The words used therein are \nclearly sufficient to require the sureties to furnish the support and \nmaintenance mentioned therein, no matter what the financial condition of the \nprincipal may be; and the bond having been given for the purposes mentioned, we \ndo not see how we would be justified in limiting the scope of the provisions of \nthe obligation beyond that which the wording clearly implies.<\/p>\n<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<\/p>\n<p><em>Arellano, C.
